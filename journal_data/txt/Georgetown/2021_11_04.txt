Georgetown University has named Alejandro Werner the founding director of the Georgetown Americas Institute (GAI).
The GAI is a platform designed to advance research, teaching and impact on policy decisions and challenges in Latin America, including rule of law, economic growth and sustainability. Werner will join the GAI in January 2022 when the new institute officially launches; he hopes to focus his tenure on addressing “concrete policy challenges” in the region, according to an Oct. 25 statement. Werner previously served as the director of the Western Hemisphere Department at the International Monetary Fund and as the undersecretary of finance and public credit of Mexico.
Werner’s career in economic and social efforts is valuable to his new position and will allow the institute to interact meaningfully with Latin America, according to Werner. 
“I have been involved in the most important economic, social and institutional issues in the region,” Werner said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I think I am in a pretty good position to understand and listen and distill what it is Americans think would be beneficial from them that the institute can generate.”
The GAI, created over the summer of 2021, aims to revitalize the academic discussion about Latin America in Washington, D.C., and the Georgetown community, according to Alma Caballero, senior advisor for the GAI. 
“What we want to make sure is that Latin America has its place within the university,” Caballero said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It is a testament to how Georgetown is thinking creatively in ways to engage and look outside the traditional places and make an impactful relationship with the region.”
Going forward, one of the institute’s first goals is to meet with a wide variety of students and hear their hopes for the initiative, to better understand how best to integrate the institute into the Georgetown community and to provide opportunities for research projects focused on Latin American issues and politics, according to Werner.
“I think there are tons of things we can do in terms of exposing the student body to a broad set of challenges that Latin America is facing, that the relationship between Latin America and the U.S. and the world is facing,” Werner said.
The GAI will bring together multiple Georgetown programs in order to foster collaboration and create more opportunities for events and research, according to Caballero.
“What’s characteristic about this new institute is that it’s not housed within one school, but it’s an umbrella that will bring the strengths of all of the schools that make Georgetown the great place to do so,” Caballero said. “It’s going to be a very collaborative space and will not only work with the deans of the different schools and the students of the different schools, but also with the faculty and the alumni network of the schools that are involved in the initiatives.”
With Werner’s work at the GAI, Georgetown’s connection to Latin America will be strengthened through research and teaching, according to an Oct. 25 statement from University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95). 
“Georgetown is delighted to welcome Alejandro Werner to the Hilltop,” DeGioia wrote in the statement. “Under his leadership, we look forward to deepening our engagement with Latin America and the hemisphere through excellence in research, teaching and service to the common good.”
Werner’s appointment will support the initiative’s goals to create positive change in the region through research and policy, according to Caballero. 
“I think he’s a very multifaceted professional, and he’s somebody that knows the region deeply and is known in the region as well,” Caballero said. “I think he brings a very creative kind of mindset, and most importantly, he has that desire to make a positive impact through this region and bring his expertise and his networks to suit the interest and the goals of the institute.”

The bold yellow letters that make up Black Lives Matter Plaza are now permanently part of the Washington, D.C. cityscape. 
The permanent installation, spanning two blocks of 16th Street NW in front of the White House, consists of the words “Black Lives Matter” in yellow-painted concrete. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) announced the completion of Black Lives Matter Plaza, made up of the yellow lettering, two opposing traffic lanes and a pedestrian plaza between the lanes, on Oct. 28. Because the mural faded in the months following its initial installation, city officials have now made the lettering permanent by applying a layer of thermoplastic paint designed to withstand weather conditions and fading. 
The mural demonstrates that people have the power to enact change, and its permanent installation further solidifies that belief, Bowser said in an Oct. 28 press release.
“When we created Black Lives Matter Plaza in June 2020, we sent a strong message that Black Lives Matter, and that power has always been and always will be with well-meaning people,” Bowser said in the press release. “Today, we have transformed the mural into a monument.” 
Bowser initially declared the section of the street “Black Lives Matter Plaza” in June 2020 after the National Guard violently forced peaceful protestors to leave the area so that former President Donald Trump could take a picture holding a Bible. 
Black Lives Matter Plaza, and the identical murals it inspired in over 19 other cities, shows the impact the mural had on a global movement, according to Keyonna Jones, founder and executive director of Congress Heights Arts and Culture Center and one of the eight artists originally commissioned by the District to paint the mural in 2020. 
“Healing starts in an internal space, and then it moves into a communal space, and then it becomes global,” Jones said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I think the moment of the mural, and how it replicated across the world, showed exactly that.”
Some activist groups, like the D.C. chapter of Black Lives Matter, called the original mural at Black Lives Matter Plaza an example of performative activism that detracts from Bowser’s lack of substantive reforms to the District’s criminal justice system, which routinely subjects Black D.C. residents to harsher sentences and unfair convictions. 
According to Bowser in the press release, the permanent installation of the mural signifies the progress that has been made and the work still left to do. 
“One of my proudest memories of Black Lives Matter Plaza is when, in his final days, Congressman John Lewis came to see it for himself,” Bowser said in the press release. “He recognized Black Lives Matter Plaza as good trouble, and we know it will remain a gathering place for reflection, planning and action, as we work toward a more perfect union.” 
The District spent $4.8 million thus far in its efforts to make the mural at Black Lives Matter Plaza permanent. Future changes aimed at making the area more accessible are forthcoming, according to the press release.
“In the coming months, an additional $3 million investment will create a more cohesive public space around the monument by reconstructing nearby sidewalks, installing commemorative works, and adding new benches, lighting, signage, and street trees,” the press release reads. 
According to Jones, by making the mural a permanent installation, the message and goal of the Black Lives Matter movement will be remembered. 
“I hope that people are reminded about what that time was like and how art was able to shift the paradigm and to understand that art is history,” Jones said. “If we didn’t have these artifacts, or if we didn’t have these moments, these monuments and these sculptures, a lot of the things that hadn’t been written down would probably be lost in history.”

A rise in positive COVID-19 cases among Georgetown University campus community members has sparked student concerns over public health protocols on campus. 
In the largest surge of on-campus COVID-19 cases since January 2021, 36 Georgetown community members, mostly undergraduate students, tested positive for COVID-19 between Oct. 26 and Oct. 28, according to an Oct. 28 email from university health officials. For the week of Oct. 24, the university reported a total of 69 positive COVID-19 cases, resulting in a .80% positivity rate, a .47 percentage point increase from the previous week. 
In response to the increase in cases between Oct. 26 and Oct. 28, the university asked students to limit gatherings during Halloween weekend, according to an email from Vice President and Chief Public Health Officer Ranit Mishori (MED ’02).
Speaker of the Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Leo Rassieur (COL ’22) said the university made the right decision to quickly test all students.
“It was reassuring that the University moved to get all students tested,” Rassieur wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Not being certain about other students’ COVID statuses makes it difficult for immunocompromised and other vulnerable students to feel comfortable attending class and accessing public spaces.” 
Anna Prince (COL ’24) said it was reassuring to see individuals complying with the testing mandate and student organizations taking extra precautions.
“I’m really proud of how the student body reacted. Everyone I know got tested as soon as they could, and all the social events I had planned to attend were cancelled or postponed. I imagine this was a difficult and disappointing decision for clubs, but everyone wants to keep each other safe,” Prince wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
However, Rassieur said he is worried about student compliance with COVID-19 safety measures in light of this outbreak. 
“I’ve spoken with many students who are worried about a possible outbreak of COVID, especially given that we just had Halloween and are approaching the holiday season,” Rassieur wrote. “We want to keep classes and student life in-person throughout this year, but it’ll be hard to achieve that if the rate of COVID cases keeps up and many students are travelling in and out of campus.”
Despite these COVID-19 concerns, Georgetown still intends to resume all in-person classes on the main campus and the Georgetown University Medical Center Nov. 29, after Thanksgiving break, according to an Oct. 5 email from Provost Robert Groves and Executive Vice President for Health Sciences Edward B. Healton to campus community members. 
In preliminary discussions with university leaders, student leaders have been told by university officials that canceling in-person classes this semester is not likely, according to Rassieur.
Though Prince is hopeful about students’ compliance with COVID-19 safety measures, she said she is also concerned about COVID-19 rates after Halloween weekend. 
“I don’t know what Georgetown’s infrastructure is for testing, but I would feel safer if everyone got tested again this week (the week after Halloween),” Prince wrote. “It’s impossible to prevent all transmission, and there were still a lot of social events this weekend.”
The university has taken extra precautions to reduce transmission of COVID-19, including increasing accessibility of grab-and-go meal options, according to a university spokesperson. 
GUSA plans to meet with Mishori and Jeanne Lord, associate vice president for student affairs and dean of students, about the university’s plans if COVID-19 cases continue to rise, according to Rassieur. 
“Obviously, we all hope that cases go down and life goes back to normal, but we want to make sure that even in the worst case scenario of many more COVID cases, there’s a response plan that protects immunocompromised students and other vulnerable groups on campus,” Rassieur wrote.

The Georgetown University Law Center was one of six top law schools to report a three-point increase in median test scores for the class of 2024. 
The Law Center Class of 2024 brought an “unprecedented” three-point increase to the school’s median Law School Admission Test (LSAT) scores. The school received 14,052 applicants to the Class of 2024, a 41% increase from 2020 and more applications than any U.S. law school in history. The median score for the class of 2024 was 171, an increase from the median score of 168 seen in the past several years, according to Andrew Cornblatt, dean of admissions at Georgetown Law.
Many more schools saw significant and surprising increases in their scores during the past cycle, according to Mike Spivey, a former Law School Admission Council (LSAC) faculty member and senior administrator at the law schools of Vanderbilt University, the University of Colorado and University of Washington in St. Louis, who independently compiled data about the median LSAT scores reported by 197 U.S. law schools. 
“A lot of schools, unlike any other cycle in the 22 years I’ve done this and probably in any cycle in the history of LSAT, are at plus three — plus two, plus three — and there is even a school at plus four,” Spivey said in a statement to The Hoya. “I’ve never seen multiple schools at plus three and I’ve never seen a school at plus four.”
Law schools across the U.S. experienced a similar point jump; Cornell University, another top 20 law school, also saw a three-point increase in its median score. Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Ore., reported the largest growth of any U.S. law school of four points, from 158 to 162. 
Virtual communication during the COVID-19 pandemic allowed the Georgetown Law admissions team to geographically diversify their recruitment efforts, leading to more personal interactions between prospective students and admissions officers and more applicants from across the country, according to Cornblatt. 
“We were able to be even more selective than usual,” Cornblatt wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Zoom made it possible for us to expand our interviews geographically which enabled us to expand our personal, one at a time process of deciding who to admit and our outreach to admitted students. As a result, we were thrilled that many more of our admits decided to join us at Georgetown.”
The Class of 2024 brought other notable statistical changes to the Law Center. The median GPA for the class of 2024 increased from 3.78 to 3.85, according to Cornblatt. In addition to the increased LSAT median score, the Georgetown Law admissions rate fell from 21% for the 2020 entering class to just 12.9%. The class is also the most racially diverse in the school’s history, with 40% of students identifying as people of color. 
The LSAT’s transition to an online format could have been a possible contributing factor toward higher scores across the country, according to Spivey. 
 “LSAC had to move the LSAT online; they had to take a five section test and make it a three section test at home versus in a scary, crowded room of anxious people,” Spivey said. “The test questions were no more or less difficult but the test itself was less difficult in the sense that it was less of an anxiety-inducing environment.” 
The rise in score and applications shows that Georgetown Law is increasingly popular, according to Cornblatt. 
“No matter the numbers for last year, we remain committed to an admissions process that looks at all aspects of an applicant, not just numbers,” Cornblatt wrote. “As for the future, I’ve learned over the years to go year by year but there is no question that Georgetown Law has never been more popular—we are excited to see what this year will bring.”

CW: This article mentions sexual assault. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
Delays in mandatory first-year bystander training prompted students and faculty to speak out about the dangers surrounding lack of education around interpersonal violence and consent. 
Bystander intervention training workshops, which educate students on interpersonal violence, safety and consent, are required for all new students at Georgetown University. The trainings typically occur early in the academic year; during the 2019-20 academic year, the university mandated students complete the training by the end of September. However, the university has not scheduled the trainings for fall 2021. With just one month left in the semester, students and faculty are concerned many students have yet to receive training on topics of interpersonal violence and consent. 
Sara Collina, Title IX expert and professor of women’s and gender studies, said the bystander training should have run in September, the most dangerous time for college sexual assaults. 
“The beginning of school is the most dangerous time, the most likely time that people will commit sexual harm,” Collina said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “Studies have shown that there is a vulnerability that happens in the first six weeks or so of school. It’s the most likely time for Georgetown students to commit sexual assault.”
More than 50% of all sexual assaults on college campuses take place between August and November, according to Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network. Additionally, students are most vulnerable to sexual assault during their first year on campus. 
Students initially raised concerns about delays in August after Health Education Services pushed back alcohol education trainings, Sexual Assault Prevention training and bystander trainings to mid-September. In September, the university announced it would host bystander intervention training workshops at an undecided later date in the fall semester. All new students have now completed the required Sexual Assault Prevention trainings and AlcoholEdu, according to a university spokesperson.
Georgetown has still not set an official start date for bystander training, but a university spokesperson said Georegtown plans to launch them “as soon as possible.”
After a fully virtual 2020-21 academic year, all first-year, sophomore and transfer students are now required to complete in-person bystander training. In past years, the university only required first-years and transfer students to participate. Now, nearly half the student body, as opposed to one-quarter, has yet to receive training. 
In light of this higher proportion of untrained students, the university must act quickly to prepare students for potential safety concerns, according to Collina. 
“One of the things that my students tell me that I find particularly heartbreaking is how committed so many of my female-identified students are to basically watching each other’s backs so they don’t get hurt,” Collina said. “That’s not what you should be doing with your Georgetown time. This is not inevitable. This is not normal.” 
Anna Cheng (MSB ’25), who must complete the bystander training as a first-year student, said she is confused by the lack of communication by the university.
“I don’t know particularly what to do, but I would use my best knowledge to do the best that I can do with what I know,” Cheng said in an interview with The Hoya.
According to Dominic Gordon (SFS ’24), the training is necessary to prepare students for potentially dangerous situations, especially as they transition from high school to college.
“I think it’s important that people have an idea of what to do if they’re in that situation,” Gordon said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
More students are currently at risk because the sophomores have not gone through the training, according to Collina. 
“We’re not talking about just a quarter of the population,” Collina said. “It’s a really large group of students who both could receive important information about expectations at Georgetown about what relationships should look like and could look like and deserve to look like.”
Resources: On-campus resources include Health Education Services (202-687-8949) and Counseling and Psychiatric Service (202-687-7080); additional off-campus resources include the D.C. Rape Crisis Center (202-333-7273) and the D.C. Forensic Nurse Examiner Washington Hospital Center (844-443-5732). If you or anyone you know would like to receive a sexual assault forensic examination or other medical care — including emergency contraception — call the Network for Victim Recovery of D.C. at 202-742-1727. To report sexual misconduct, you can contact Georgetown’s Title IX coordinator at 202-687-9183 or file an online report here. Emergency contraception is available at the CVS located at 1403 Wisconsin Ave NW and through H*yas for Choice. For more information, visit sexualassault.georgetown.edu.

Towne Wine and Liquor has relocated to a new storefront because of its inability to pay the rent at its former location.
The popular liquor store among students and members of the Georgetown University community, affectionately known as “Towne,” moved one block north to 1438 Wisconsin Ave. While Towne began the moving process Oct. 18, the new store location will not open to customers until Nov. 4.
According to Joey Chen, owner of Towne Wine and Liquor, the rent in the new lease for the former storefront was too high, so relocation was necessary in order to stay in business. 
“The landlord wanted to increase the rent, and at that time, because of COVID, school was closed, everybody was at home and we were closed for three months, and my rent was almost ending,” Chen said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “They wanted to sign a new lease to increase the rent to $10,000, and we can’t afford it, so we just found a new place.”
Alex Chan (MSB ’23), assistant store manager at Towne Wine and Liquor who is responsible for running the store’s social media platforms, announced the upcoming move in an Oct. 20 Instagram post.
The new location will have more space than Towne’s former location, which will allow for more customers and inventory in the store and a more efficient payment system. The changes will help make Towne more accessible, according to Chan.
“There will definitely be a complete upgrade of the cashier system, and we also have a website coming up,” Chan said. “It will be kinda large going into the new spot, and we are looking forward to that.”
Once the new location opens Nov. 4, Towne will also have a 10% off sale in an effort to welcome customers while getting rid of inventory from the former store, according to Chen.
“We might lower the price a little bit, and then we might do more sales on it,” Chen said. “The product is pretty much about the same right now, because we’re just moving the inventory over.”
According to Chan, Towne, which frequently delivers orders to student clubs and Greek life organizations, set up a promo code Oct. 18 for student groups to access the sales first to get rid of inventory before the moving process.
“I give a promo code to student groups prior to other people and people on the social media, because I want them to come in and grab the bulk of that,” Chan said. “I want them to be able to have that priority and have to come in earlier than other people.”
When it was time to officially move inventory and appliances, Towne enlisted the help of Georgetown University students who worked in exchange for neon signs from the former store, according to Chan.
“We wanted big boys, and where can we find big boys?” Chan said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “The Georgetown rugby club’s big forwards come down to help us move the stuff, and then we give them the beer signs in return.”
In addition to the free neon signs, Georgetown students who helped with the move and were over 21 received a discount, according to Chen. 
“Because they helped us with moving the coolers and everything, we gave them a deal of 10% or 15% off when they come to buy, but of course, they have to be over 21,” Chen said. “When they come shopping here, we give them a discount because they helped us moving all the coolers and all the product stuff.” 
Towne’s new location will represent a new era for the liquor store, according to Chan. 
“We just want to make sure people know that it will be a new start for the Towne Liquor Store in a new location,” Chan said.

Pumpkins, skeletons and spiderwebs decorated the houses in the Georgetown neighborhood, but the streets were quieter than usual on Halloween night. 
This year, while many of the traditional Halloween activities in Washington, D.C., like trick-or-treating and visiting various embassies in costume, were allowed to take place, the festivities appeared to be less popular than in previous years amid ongoing public health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to Janice Day, a resident of the Georgetown neighborhood who was handing out candy to trick-or-treaters from her front porch, turnout was lower than she expected this year.
“It is surprisingly light on this street, but I have to say, prior to the pandemic it was pretty crowded. I don’t know if some people are reluctant,” Day said in an interview with The Hoya. “There were so many decorations this year that I thought that meant that there would be a lot of trick-or-treaters, but not so much.”
Trick-or-treating was permitted in the District this year, but Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) warned residents about the increased risk of contracting COVID-19 for unvaccinated young children and advised outdoor activities were safer than indoor activities in her guidelines for Halloween and Día de los Muertos.
The government’s vaccination initiative for children ages 5 to 11 will not begin until Nov. 8.
In 2020, the District guidelines declared trick-or-treating to be a high-risk activity and instead encouraged other socially distanced activities, like driving around to look at decorations or using a candy chute to deliver candy as a safer alternative to reaching into a communal bowl. 
Although Georgetown residents like Day said there appeared to be less trick-or-treaters in the Georgetown neighborhood than in the years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, many locals still put a lot of effort into making their homes look festive for the Halloween season by adorning their windows and porches with carved pumpkins, fall flowers and spooky decorations, according to Day.
According to Zoe Persina, who brought her children to the Georgetown neighborhood to go trick-or-treating this Halloween, it was nice to see some trick-or-treaters and beautifully decorated houses.
“My favorite part is all of the decorations, especially along Q Street,” Persina said in an interview with The Hoya. 
According to Maddie Morgan (COL ’24), who trick-or-treated in the Georgetown neighborhood with friends, the decorations and presence of children dressed up in costumes made the area feel very festive.
“It was nice seeing all the decorations and a lot of kids trick-or-treating and people handing out candy, which was cute,” Morgan said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It was definitely more of a Halloween feeling, I would say, in the Georgetown neighborhood.”
In addition to trick-or-treating in Georgetown, other Halloween activities were also impacted last year. The annual Embassy Row trick-or-treating program was moved to an online format, with candy delivered to people’s homes before they attended a virtual event. 
While traditions like embassy trick-or-treating were able to take place this year, the celebrations were underwhelming, according to Morgan, who also visited the embassies with a group of friends.
“This is my first Halloween in D.C., and we heard some people talking about trick-or-treating at the embassies and how in previous years they had done that, so we just decided to try it out,” Morgan said. “A lot of them had their lights off and weren’t doing trick-or-treating, so we didn’t actually get to trick-or-treat at any of them.”
Still, to Day, even if Halloween was not completely back to normal, it was an improvement from last year, and it was exciting to greet trick-or-treaters and neighbors.
“I enjoyed seeing all the children in their costumes and also seeing my neighbors,” Day said.

President Joe Biden nominated Georgetown University Law Center fellow Gigi Sohn to serve on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), who if confirmed would be the first openly LGBTQ commissioner.
Sohn is a Distinguished Fellow at Georgetown Law’s Institute of Technology Law & Policy, where she has focused her work on public interest advocacy for an open internet and telecommunications network. Sohn’s nomination was announced Oct. 26. 
In addition to her role at Georgetown Law, Sohn serves as a senior fellow and public advocate at the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, a nonprofit that advocates for open and affordable broadband internet. Sohn also served as counselor to former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler from 2013 to 2016, where she was closely involved with the Commission’s policies on net neutrality and broadband privacy.
If confirmed, Sohn will focus on ensuring the programs under the FCC’s regulatory authority help the individuals they intend to service, according to Adrianne Furniss, executive director of the Benton Institute. 
“Gigi’s service as a member of the Federal Communications Commission will make sure that the programs that fall under the FCC’s purview work for those who are intended to benefit from them; and that any future communications policy is enacted in the public’s interest,” Furniss wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The FCC, which comprises five members nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, oversees and regulates communications and technological innovation. The Commission has only had four members since Jan. 20, after former Chairman Ajit Pai stepped down, leaving two members appointed by the Obama Administration and two by the Trump Administration. Since Pai’s departure, Democrats have called on Biden to appoint a fifth member to break political deadlock in the Commission. 
At Georgetown, Sohn contributed to the academic community in numerous ways and has continued to advocate for accessible communication, according to Georgetown Law Dean William Treanor. 
“Gigi has been a true thought leader in these areas for decades as one of the nation’s leading public advocates for open, affordable and democratic communications networks,” Treanor wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Rapid advances in technology are continually raising new ethical, social, and legal challenges, and our society faces a critical need for experts across fields who are prepared to address these issues.” 
Once Sohn is officially nominated to the Commission, the Senate Committee for Commerce, Science, and Transportation will hold confirmation hearings and a vote to confirm her. 
Sohn declined The Hoya’s request for comment due to her upcoming Senate confirmation hearing.
Prior to joining Georgetown Law, Sohn founded Public Knowledge in 2001, a public interest group that advocates for freedom of expression, open internet and access to affordable communications tools. Sohn left Public Knowledge in 2013.
Sohn’s career has demonstrated a full commitment to advocacy and collaboration, according to Jenna Leventoff, a senior policy counsel at Public Knowledge.
“During her time at Public Knowledge, and in fact her whole career, Gigi Sohn has engaged in nuanced policy analysis, passionate advocacy, and pragmatic coalition building,” Leventoff wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We expect Gigi to bring this same passion and experience to her role as an FCC Commissioner.”
Sohn’s nomination comes after Biden issued an executive order in July calling on the FCC to restore Obama-era net neutrality regulations, which would require internet providers to treat all internet services equally to promote free competition. 
As an FCC Commissioner, Sohn will have the ability to develop and implement net neutrality policy, as well as other programs under federal communications policy, which are central aspects to modern democracy, according to Furniss.
“Communication policy — rooted in the values of access, equity, and diversity — has the power to deliver new opportunities, strengthen communities, and ensure a thriving democracy,” Furniss wrote in an email to the Hoya. “Open, diverse, and affordable communications networks are essential to full participation in our society, our economy, our culture, and our democracy.”
Sohn is not the first Georgetown Law professor to be nominated for a position by the Biden Administration. Georgetown Law professor Alvaro Bedoya was appointed to the FCC on Sept. 13 and McCourt School of Public Policy professor Adriana Kugler was nominated to be the U.S. executive director at the World Bank on Aug. 4. Bedoya and Kugler are both still awaiting Senate confirmation.
If confirmed, Sohn will use her position to create positive change and communication policy for the country, according to Treanor.
“Gigi is a leading voice on promoting accessible, affordable communications networks that are available to all Americans,” Treanor wrote. “While we will miss having her on our campus, I know that in this new role, consumers across the country will benefit from her expertise.”

Metro trains will be delayed until at least Nov. 15 amid an ongoing investigation into a recent train derailment.
Riders found themselves in a dark, smoky Metro car after an Oct. 12 derailment of a Blue line train. The incident prompted the National Transportation Safety Board to investigate, and Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority (WMATA) removed all 7000-series trains from service for inspection, reducing the number of trains in operation by 60%. As a result, Metro customers are facing significant transit delays while WMATA seeks to resolve the safety concerns.
According to an Oct. 19 press statement, customers should expect delays on all lines as WMATA continues operations with significantly less trains available for service.
“While Metro aims to provide service consistent with the announced basic service plan through the rest of the week, customers should anticipate trains every 15-20 minutes on the Red Line and every 30-40 minutes on all other lines to account for any unplanned disruptions,” the press statement reads. “There is currently no capacity to fill unforeseen gaps, which will result in longer wait times.”  
Georgetown University students, who can access the Dupont Circle and Rosslyn Metro stations via the free Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle, will also experience similar delays. As of Nov. 1, service on the Red line, which runs through the Dupont station, will operate every 15 to 20 minutes, while the Blue, Silver and Orange lines, which serve the Rosslyn station, will run every 30 to 40 minutes. As a result of train shortages, the Silver line will only operate between the Wiehle-Reston East and Largo Town Center stations. 
In an effort to alleviate some of the inconvenience caused by the Metro delays, Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) announced a partnership with Lyft on Oct. 25 to provide free 30-day Capital Bikeshare memberships to D.C. residents who register. The initiative will make the District more accessible while residents wait until they are able to return to their previous commute and transportation routes. 
WMATA is working to put old 2000, 3000 and 6000-series trains into service in an effort to increase the number of trains available from 31 to 50 and expects to have 39 trains in service as of Nov. 1, which will allow the Silver line to be extended.  
Delays will be in effect until at least Nov. 15 while WMATA works with the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission to get all 7000-series trains safely returned to service, according to Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld in an Oct. 28 press statement. 
“We’ve completed inspections of every 7000-series railcar, over 3,000 axles in all, and are now working with the WMSC on a testing plan that will allow the trains to safely return to service,” Wiedefeld wrote in the press statement. “We will continue to provide regular updates to our customers and the public as more is known about a timeline for full service restoration.”
