The Student Activities Commission voted last night to sanction workers’ rights group Georgetown Solidarity Committee by admitting the group into a restoration process that removes GSC control over its budget.
The restoration sanction, announced at a public hearing in the Healey Family Student Center, was approved by a seven-to-three vote. As a result, GSC leadership will lose control over its own budget and will be forced to request funding on a case-by-case basis. The group will retain all other rights as an established club.
GSC will be in restoration until spring 2018, with the opportunity to file an appeal to SAC to lift the sanctions in December.
The sanctions come after the students ignored multiple requests from Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and Chief of Staff Joseph Ferrara to vacate university premises at the close of business hours Dec. 8.
Eight members of GSC remained in DeGioia’s suite of offices overnight until Dec. 9, when the university announced that it would not renew the university’s contract with Nike unless the company allowed independent workers rights monitoring group Worker Rights Consortium independent access and reporting of complaints regarding factory condition.
The students who remained in the suite overnight also received personal sanctions, given their violations of the university’s Code of Student Conduct. They have been put on disciplinary probation until the fall 2017 semester, are required to pay a $50 fine, serve five work sanction hours and send a formal letter of apology to Ferrara, according to an Office of Student Conduct letter sent to GSC members Friday.
According to SAC Chair Ricardo Mondolfi (SFS ’19), restoration is one step below full access.
“A club in restoration has every right that a club under access to benefits has, but they lose a budget,” Mondolfi said. “As a group under SAC we want to make sure that they succeed and thrive.”
SAC, which is responsible for club funding, called a hearing after a complaint was filed with the Center for Student Engagement alleging that GSC disrupted the functions of the university and used university space without permission, both of which are prohibited under the Student Organization Standards, set by the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs.
All clubs are required to adhere to the Student Organization Standards in order to receive university funding.
GSC members Joseph Gomez (SFS ’19), Maddy Rice (COL ’20) and Lily Ryan (COL ’17) attended the hearing.
Rice said the sanctions are inconvenient but not excessive.
“It’s definitely an inconvenience for us, it’s not an unmanageable convenience and we respect the decision to put that restriction on us,” Rice said. “As far as the GSC board, we’re satisfied with the actions taken. We understand why they were taken and we look forward to working with SAC.”
Restoration was pitched as a relatively mild sanction compared to fines or being stripped of university funding for club trips.
Mondolfi said he is glad the committee was able to agree on a sanction that GSC accepts.
“It’s good both that we think these sanctions are appropriate, and that they do think that the sanctions are appropriate, and we look forward to helping them work and succeed as a SAC organization,” Mondolfi said. “Our intention was always to educate and repair rather than punish, and I think they understand that.”
During the SAC hearing, the GSC representatives argued that the eight GSC members who stayed overnight in the president’s office acted as individuals, and their protest did not constitute a GSC event.
As such, they argued it would be inappropriate to sanction the entire group.
Several commissioners expressed skepticism at this argument. During the hearing, SAC Vice Chair
Thaameran Sarveswaran (SFS ’18) emphasized that the sit-in was a GSC group event.
“I fail to see how it is at all in question that this is a group event,” Sarveswaran said. “It’s absolutely appropriate for us to sanction them as an organization.”
Mondolfi said that the language used by GSC in promoting and publicizing the event make it clear that it was a group event, and that GSC is therefore responsible for the rules violations.
“Even if we considered that this was a GSC event until close of business and then it wasn’t, the language GSC used in their social media campaign and even in the banner that they threw over the office was ‘occupied until DeGioia cuts Nike,’ ‘we are staying here until the contract is ended,” Mondolfi said. “The commission found that even if we agree to their point that they didn’t personally disrupt it, the language they were using was an imminent threat of disruption. When you say ‘we aren’t leaving until you do this,’ that is threatening disruption.”
In addition to violating the Student Organization Standards, Mondolfi said GSC failed to comply with certain aspects of SAC policy, including failing to request SAC approval to hold the event when using university space.
The SAC hearing came after the Georgetown University Student Association voted Sunday in support of a resolution condemning the university for over-sanctioning the individual GSC members, claiming it restrained student activism. Twelve senators voted for the resolution, and seven abstained from voting. No senators voted against the resolution.
“It discourages future student activism and kind of ignores how instrumental student activism has been on the campus before in the past and probably will be moving forward,” GUSA Sen. Jasmin Ouseph (SFS ’19), who introduced the motion, said. “We just wanted to express that we as GUSA, and kind of on behalf of the student body, are recognizing the value of student protest and the work they did and probably will continue to do.”

On Friday night, United States District Court Judge James Robart (LAW ’73), a Georgetown University Law Center alumnus, suspended President Donald Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order temporarily barring entry to refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries.
Intervening in an ongoing legal clash between immigration activists and the Trump administration, Robart’s ruling blocked the implementation of the president’s executive order nationwide. The Department of Homeland Security immediately returned to its regular screening procedures for all travelers to the United States. The Department of State also began to reissue visas it had cancelled after Trump signed the order.
After Robart’s ruling, the Trump administration asked the appeals court for a temporary stay before hearing from the plaintiffs. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declined to issue the stay.
Today, the Ninth Circuit plans to hear oral arguments concerning the Trump administration’s appeal of the suspension.
Robart’s ruling in the case, which spawned from an appeal made by state attorney generals from Washington and Minnesota, marked the most comprehensive ruling compared to previous decisions by federal judges, which either temporarily blocked parts of the order or restricted its implementation on travelers already in the United States. No previous ruling reached an appeals court.
Last night, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals announced it would hear oral arguments Tuesday challenging and supporting the travel ban. The court will not determine whether the ban is constitutional, which is what brought it before Robart in the first place, but whether it should be temporarily suspended.
The Washington and Minnesota attorneys general argue that the ban violates the Establishment Clause in the First Amendment, since it requires the government grant preference to one religion over another. They also cite violations to the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, which prohibits federal discrimination based on religion and national origin.
According to CNN, the Justice Department argues that Robart’s order should be lifted and the executive order be allowed to go back into effect while the legal process continues due to national security concerns.
Robart, who was nominated by former President George W. Bush to preside over legal matters in the Western District of Washington, had represented refugees and disadvantaged minority groups in court prior to his appointment, which was confirmed by a 99 to 0 Senate vote.
As a student at GULC, Robart worked as an editor at the Georgetown Law Journal.
Georgetown University Law Center professor Phillip Schrag, who teaches classes on representing refugees who are seeking asylum in the United States, said Robart had to consider his position as a member of the judicial branch compared to Trump’s authority to pass executive orders as president.
“The president has the most authority in terms of the courts deferring to him when he deals with national security,” Schrag, who also serves as the director for the GULC Center for Applied Legal Studies, said. “They are very reluctant to interfere with his authority in that area, and especially when Congress has spoken and given him some authority.”
Schrag referred to the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which grants the president the authority to deny entry to “any class of aliens the president deems detrimental to the national interest.”
“That’s pretty broad language. It’s hard to imagine more sweeping language than that. That’s the language the president is relying on,” Schrag said. “However, there’s something to be said on the other side, too. A president’s order, in fact any governmental action, isn’t valid under the Fifth Amendment if it doesn’t have some rational basis.”
Georgetown Law’s Student Bar Association, the GULC student government, passed a resolution Jan. 31 in support of students affected by the executive order.
[scribd id=338707720 key=key-FrLWW1CiaoZR8nEyl98e mode=scroll]
 
Ata Akiner (LAW ’19), a delegate in the SBA, said part of his reasoning for helping introduce the resolution was the knowledge that his fellow GULC students were directly affected by the ban.
“Before proposing this resolution, I did confirm with the school’s administration that we do have students affected by the Immigration Executive Order that was passed,” Akiner wrote in an email to The Hoya. “They are very few in number, but in my view, even if one student were affected that is too many.”
Akiner said the resolution was passed with support from members of the SBA Diversity Committee as well as 27 GULC student groups, including the Georgetown Law Democrats, the Republican Law Students Association, an LGBTQ student group named Outlaw, the Muslim Law Students Association, the Jewish Law Students Association, the Christian Legal Society and the National Security Law Society.
Richard Hand (LAW ’18), who is also a delegate in the SBA, said he supported the resolution because diversity is a key part of a legal education.
“The reactions within the student body have ranged from outrage to concern,” Hand wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Many of us pride ourselves on the school’s international standing and the diversity of the student body. GULC is a tight knit community, so when we see our classmates afraid of traveling or lamenting the fact that their parents may not be able to attend Commencement, everyone is affected.”
According to Shrag, Robart had to analyze certain factors before making the decision, including how much harm would be done to companies, students and professors who were abroad during the time of the order.
Joshua Branch (LAW ’18), a delegate in the SBA and member of the Black Law Student Association, said he supported the resolution because of the tangible effects it has on GULC students.
“Speaking to the general response of law students, I think that a majority of law students have been concerned about the executive order both for our colleagues, families and friends, as well as what it means for what the United States stands for as a beacon of democracy to the world,” Branch wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Akiner expressed happiness to partake in activism at GULC.
“I can’t tell you how proud I am to be a student at Georgetown Law,” Akiner wrote. “Our motto is ‘Law is but the means, justice is the end,’ and I strongly believe that we are living up to that.”

When Aleta Mack, a former executive assistant to Georgetown University Police Department Chief Jay Gruber, started experiencing breathing difficulties and headaches while in Village C West in August 2014, Mack filed an external complaint for a health hazard evaluation while requesting accommodation from the university.
Mack was not able to come to an agreement with the university on her work and was ultimately put on suspension and terminated from the university’s employment March 5, 2015.
Two years later, Mack is now in litigation against Georgetown on the grounds that the university failed to properly accommodate her when she was experiencing medical issues caused by mold.
Mack’s lawsuit is one in a series of complaints from students and faculty related to mold at Georgetown. Mack’s case specifically refers to whether the university is found to have violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, a law guaranteeing equal employment opportunities and other rights for disabled people in the United States.
Some students were forced to temporarily move out of housing this fall after discovering mold in their room.
A Case Unresolved
In the lawsuit filed May 2015, Mack said the university violated the ADA by failing to accommodate her respiratory issues stemming from mold exposure.
On Aug. 4, 2014, Mack filed her first complaint with the university after she suspected that her medical issues were caused by the mold. In response, the university conducted remediation work and air sampling Aug. 21, 2014 to demonstrate that there was no more harmful mold left.
However, Mack and other GUPD employees whose names cannot be disclosed were not satisfied and filed an external complaint Aug. 27, 2014 with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.
NIOSH epidemiologist Sandra White conducted a health hazard evaluation in response to the complaints and sent a close-out letter, a summary of NIOSH’s findings, to the university in October 2014.
White wrote in the letter that air sample methods used by the university’s contractor were ineffective at precisely analyzing mold levels in the air. White added that the university needed to further clean the mold damage and add dehumidifiers in the office where the mold developed.
In an interview with The Hoya, White said she spoke to several members of the facilities and environmental safety offices during the health hazard evaluation. White confirmed that there were concerns that the university had improperly addressed issues stemming from mold, including not repairing the mold-damaged drywall and only cleaning it with disinfectant.
The employees all reported headaches that abated within an hour of leaving the affected area, according to the letter.
The university reported to White that they had followed through on her recommendations, including cleaning mold damage and installing dehumidifiers. The letter is a non-binding set of recommendations.
However, problems persisted as Mack continued to experience symptoms related to mold.
“She inadvertently left a cup of tea on her desk when she left work due to sudden illness on 11/10/14. The photo showed the cup of tea was still there with several groups of colored matter floating in the fluid, consistent with presence of mold,” a Nov. 19, 2014 letter from Mack’s allergist, Sheryl Lucas, reads.
Mack and the university continued to negotiate terms of her employment and workplace accommodation in 2015. Court documents show the university offered Mack a new job position, but Mack failed to respond to the offer and the university terminated her employment on March 5, 2015. Mack claims she was fired in retaliation for her original complaints of mold.
Outside of Court
Issues of mold at Georgetown extend beyond Mack’s lawsuit and into the dormitories of undergraduate students.
Village A, Village C West and Village C East have the highest frequency of reported mold issues on campus. Last year, 54 cases of mold were reported to Facilities and Management from Village A, while 50 cases of mold were reported from Village C last year, according to data provided to The Hoya by Facilities and Management.
The amount of mold work requests is the highest from the late summer to early fall in August and September, when humidity is high. Around half of the mold work requests actually turn out to be mold; the other half of cases is surface dirt and dust.
Executive Director for Residential Services Patrick Killilee wrote in an email to The Hoya that if mold remediation work is extensive and disruptive, students would be relocated to temporary housing provided by the university.
Vice President of Facilities and Management Robin Morey said when a complaint about mold is received, trained facilities workers are sent to clean up the mold damage. For more serious cases, outside technicians are called to remove the mold growths.
Morey said mold tends to either involve carpets with water damage from rain, a leaky air conditioning unit or improper sanitation of living quarters and bathrooms — a preventable cause. Mold is caused by a combination of high levels of humidity and warm temperatures allowing fungi spores to germinate.
“Many of such complaints are minor conditions which can be addressed with appropriate cleaning. Regular cleaning of such areas would prevent the minor mold growth from occurring,” Morey wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Health Effects of Mold
While mold does not usually cause people in affected areas to develop new medical conditions, it can exacerbate the symptoms of those already suffering from respiratory conditions, such as allergies or asthma, according to Dori Germolec, a toxicology researcher at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.
“The biggest challenges tend to be with people with preexisting respiratory conditions. So individuals that have asthma or allergies may be more sensitive to the effects of mold and it can exacerbate their asthma symptoms,” Germolec said.
According to Germolec, mold can be found almost everywhere and is generally not dangerous.
“Mold is really everywhere. It is impossible to avoid. We are all exposed to it all the time. In normal concentrations it’s not harmful,” Germolec said.
But when someone has pre-existing respiratory conditions, the effects can be detrimental.
“About 15 minutes after arriving at work she had onset of difficulty breathing with postnasal drainage, itchy throat, chest tightness, feeling of pressure and pain in the crown and occipital areas of the head and burning sensation in the eyes,” the November 2014 letter from Mack’s allergist wrote.
The lawsuit is still in litigation and no court date has been set. The university’s legal counsel has attempted to have the case dismissed.

Over 5000 demonstrators gathered in Washington, D.C., on Saturday to protest President Donald Trump’s executive order prohibiting individuals from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States.
Peace for Iran, a worldwide organization dedicated to promoting Iranian voices, organized the protest of Trump’s Jan. 28 order, which bans individuals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from coming into the country for 90 days.
The organization’s founder, Negar Mortazavi, said it was important to the group to organize the demonstration because they did not feel previous protests were large enough to send a message to the Trump administration.
“I went to a couple of protests after the executive order was signed, and I thought they just weren’t big enough. There were only a few hundred people, and there’s a lot more people affected, especially in the D.C. area,” Mortazavi said.
The rally began in front of the White House, and protesters then marched to the Supreme Court, stopping along the way to chant in front of Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue.
According to the National Iranian American Council, a D.C.-based nonprofit, in 2003 there were about 28,000 Iranian Americans in Maryland and Virginia. The organization published these numbers in an Iran Census Report entitled “Strength in Numbers;” however, they did not include the District’s population of Iranian Americans and have not conducted a census since.
Mortazavi said now the District has one of the largest Iranian-American populations in the country.
“We just needed to mobilize more people, especially Iranian Americans. We need to communicate how we feel this is unfair,” Mortazavi said.
Mortazavi also said it was important for the group to hold the protest because they wanted to bring together the various groups that have reached out in support since the signing of the executive order. Mortazavi listed the Jewish community, the LGBTQ community and Black Lives Matter protesters among his group’s supporters.
“This is unjust and unfair and discriminatory, but we as Iranians and Iranian Americans are directly affected by the travel ban — the Muslim ban,” Mortazavi said. “Obviously, we feel that it’s our responsibility more than anybody else to come together and organize, but we’ve had the support of not only those from the other six countries affected by the ban, but also many Muslims of other countries and other Americans who were not even Muslim.”
Bella Stenvall, a speaker at the event who called for young people to stand up for vulnerable communities, said in an interview with The Hoya that she was motivated to speak to demonstrators because of the time she spent in refugee camps in Greece.
“It was the impact on so many families because of this executive order. It really felt like it was a personal attack on so many of my friends, as well as the people I have worked with,” Stenvall said. “The ability to say that in front of thousands of protesters was really rewarding.”
During her speech, Stenvall urged listeners to protest the executive order, no matter their background.
“I send a message to every adult that is here and that is living here. It does not matter what your age is or what religion you identify with. This is a call to action right now,” Stenvall said. “We cannot afford to be apathetic. We cannot afford to be complacent. We cannot afford to sit behind our cell phones and sit behind our computer screens and think that is enough.”
Tony Hack, a photographer who attended Saturday’s demonstration, said he was inspired to protest because he feels it is necessary for everyone to support diversity and inclusiveness in response to Trump’s order.
“In this country, if one isn’t white, male, affluent and Christian, one is under assault, and it’s only a matter of time before a person finds themselves in the crosshairs of this administration,” Hack said. “I’m not inspired by blind resistance, and there’s an opportunity to come together and find common ground. But, on these kinds of issues, we all have to resist this administration.”
Seema Shaw-Nelson, who came from Baltimore,Md., to attend the protest with her children, ages six and nine, and said she was inspired by the energetic, hopeful nature of the event.
“The tone of the protest wasn’t angry at all. It was a very positive, fun and energetic environment,” Shaw-Nelson said. “It felt like were all on the same side participating in something big, participating in democracy. It was a very safe environment where even my kids felt included.”

For about 20 hours, the Georgetown community was unaware that a student had been kidnapped Jan. 26 due to a communication lapse between the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police and the Georgetown University Police Department.
Although the kidnapping reportedly occurred about three blocks from the front gates of Georgetown — outside Saxby’s coffee shop — MPD did not notify GUPD, as the crime did not occur on campus.
According to the MPD police report on the incident, the Georgetown student was walking along  the 3400 block of O Steet when an unarmed suspect forced the student into a light gray or silver SUV. The suspect then drove the victim to several stores and ATMs and tried to force the victim to withdraw money or make large purchases, according to the victim’s account. The victim was released unharmed.
The incident took place at about 3:20 p.m. on Thursday and was reported to MPD later that afternoon.
In an email to The Hoya, GUPD Chief of Police Jay Gruber said MPD never informed campus police of the kidnapping and GUPD heard about it late the following morning from a university staff member who had spoken with the victim.
“The Georgetown University Police Department has always shared a strong partnership and open communication with the Metropolitan Police Department, especially the Second District leadership,” Gruber wrote. “While we understand that a case such as the reported kidnapping involves a number of MPD units and personnel, which can slow the dissemination of information, GUPD reiterated its request for timely notifications. In this particular case, MPD failed to notify GUPD of this crime.”
After campus police learned of the kidnapping Friday morning, they worked to confirm details and sent out a Public Safety Alert, via email and text message, to the campus community by early afternoon.
MPD spokesperson Karimah Bilal wrote in an email to The Hoya that D.C. police are not required by law to notify campus police of crimes that occur off campus and do not represent a safety threat to the university. Bilal did not acknowledge wrongdoing on behalf of the department.
“MPD has followed the proper protocol for notifying District residents of this incident,” Bilal wrote. “Based on circumstances of the offense not occurring on campus nor being within a certain proximity, MPD was not required to contact the Georgetown University Police Department.”
In response, Gruber maintained that his department should have been informed of the nearby kidnapping.
“I really have nothing to say about Mr. Bilal’s statement,” Gruber wrote. “I strongly feel GUPD should have been notified in order to alert and better protect our community and, in fact, we were not.”
Georgetown University Student Association President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said the fact that MPD did not violate any formal law may be part of the problem.
“There is clearly some chaos when it comes to GUPD and MPD’s relationship,” Khan said. “For something involving a Georgetown student, the fact that we were not immediately notified is very concerning. There needs to be a written form agreement on MPD notifying the university of any incident within a certain radius of our campus, especially when it is pertaining to a student.”
Media Relations Manager Ryan King wrote in an email to The Hoya that the university has a positive and improving relationship with D.C. police.
“We have a strong relationship with MPD and are in regular communication to continually strengthen it. In addition, when images of the suspect became available we notified our community of this new information along with a reminder of safety tips,” King wrote.
The principal and headmaster of Georgetown Visitation Mary Kate Blaine did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but an administrative assistant confirmed the school also had not been directly contacted by MPD.
Harriet Winslow, assistant to Holy Trinity Principal Charlie Hennessy, said Holy Trinity often uses the HOYAlert and Public Safety Alert services offered by GUPD for neighborhood safety information, meaning the communication failure with GUPD also impacted the nearby elementary school.
Winslow added the school was never directly contacted about the kidnapping but later received word from three Georgetown University sources. Winslow said Holy Trinity maintains a strong relationship with MPD but echoed Gruber’s call for direct notifications in the future.
“It certainly would be appropriate for them to contact us directly,” Winslow said. “In the future that would be nice.”

Georgetown University and Georgetown University Medical Center saw a slight decline in federal funding for the fiscal year 2016 from fiscal year 2015.
The Medical Center received $76.68 million in federal funding, a decrease from 2015. Researchers on the main campus received less money as well.
Together, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, government programs that provide much of the funding for science programs, gave out nearly $40 billion in total grants and funding to institutions during fiscal year 2016, a $2 billion dollar increase over fiscal year 2015.
Mann said faculty on the main campus were able to retain much of the funding they had received despite the slight decrease in federal money.
“We’re holding strong,” Mann said. “But, people are a little nervous, because it’s been going down in real dollars and some people are just hoping that the government will continue to support the sciences.”
Mann noted that main campus science programs and the GUMC, which receives the bulk of the federal research funds that the university receives, have had to diversify their funding sources by applying for grants from multiple federal agencies this year.
“Our faculty in the sciences on the main campus have diversified a bit because there’s not just NSF and NIH, there’s other agencies, there’s Department of Energy and Department of Defense,” Mann said. “They can have fairly deeper pockets than some of the other agencies.”
Robert Clarke, the dean for research at the Medical Center, said that most of the funding for the Medical Center came from the NIH. However, he said that the amount received, despite being a slight decrease from fiscal year 2015, was still greater than in fiscal year 2014.
“That is down from the previous year, but up from the one before that, reflecting the uncertainty of funding sources,” Clarke wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Clarke said that due to the funding decrease, the role of private funding for research has increased. In order to have a better chance for bigger grants in the future, researchers often request and receive smaller grants from private individuals or companies to bolster their research.
“We have a number of community philanthropists called ‘Partners in Research’ who provide seed funding for the exploration of early scientific ideas,” Clarke wrote. “These are critical dollars for researchers to generate data that then helps to apply for larger grants.”
Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming said that part of the difficulty in getting grants is that Georgetown’s funding comes from a pool of money that is appropriated by Congress to a number of federal agencies.
“One of the big challenges, though, is that the funding for the departments of labor, education, health and human services, which includes the NIH, all come from the same appropriations bill,” Fleming said. “Hence, they compete against one another.”
Fleming also noted that there has not yet been a fiscal year 2017 budget passed. Instead, Congress passed a continuing resolution to keep fiscal year 2016’s budget until late April, when they will potentially pass a new budget.
According to Fleming, there is new uncertainty involved for future spending on research, despite bipartisan concerns. With potential tax cuts and new proposed spending, Georgetown’s federal funding may suffer.
“We just don’t know how it’s going to play out,” Fleming said. “You can imagine if those who want to balance the budget prevail, they’ll raise defense spending, build the wall and cut taxes — there will be dramatic cuts in other areas of spending.”
Clarke said that past cuts to research funding have caused the GUMC to diversify its funding resources, but uncertainty still remains due to continuing dependency on the NIH. He warned against cutting spending for grants, especially for the sciences.
“We have serious issues right now with an aging Baby Boomer population that will experience the Silver Tsunami of disorders including Alzheimer’s and cancer,” Clarke wrote. “We can’t afford to go backwards.”
Correction: This article previously stated the main campus science programs receive the bulk of federal research funds; GUMC receives the bulk of federal research funds. This article also previously stated there is only a 4 percent chance of NIH applicants receiving federal funding; this is not true.

About 40 workers at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. voted to join the labor union Unite Here, which represents about 6,500 hospitality workers in the Washington area.
Trump can appoint members of the National Labor Relations Board, which enforces United States federal labor law, including the oversight of collective bargaining and unfair labor practices.
Georgetown University history professor Joseph McCartin, who specializes in labor issues, suggested this situation is unique in that it involves a president who is financially reliant on the decision making of his political inferiors.
“This is really an unprecedented situation. Those facilities are all subject to labor law and yet the president can appoint people who have every power over determining how the labor law is interpreted,” McCartin said.
Trump International Hotel Director of Sales and Marketing Patricia Tang declined to comment.
Last fall, Unite Here organized protests at the hotel’s opening with more than 400 demonstrators in attendance, demanding that Donald Trump recognize the unionization efforts of workers at the Trump Hotel in Los Vegas, in addition to organizing a nation-wide boycott of Trump products in response to his stance on labor issues.
Unite Here’s D.C. chapter Executive Secretary and Treasurer John Boardman told The Washington Post that 95 percent of Trump housekeepers and guest-room workers voted to join the union, which will push to adopt the same benefits and protections offered to workers at other downtown Washington hotels.
The move presents the possibility of tense labor negotiations involving newly-elected President Trump, who has yet to divest from his real estate business. This marks the first unionization at the Trump International Hotel, as well as the first unionization of Trump workers since the inauguration.
McCartin said workers often vote to unionize based on the increased benefits and pay that are inherent in doing so.
“No doubt they are aware of the fact that unionized workers earn more in wages and benefits than [non-]unionized workers,” McCartin said. “No doubt they are aware that unionized workers, through union contract, get more due process on the job if they have a grievance.”

University President John J. DeGioia announced Friday that he had joined hundreds of university presidents in signing two open letters attempting to dissuade President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly (GRD ’84) from enforcing the Jan. 27 executive order restricting immigration and refugee entry.
The signings came the same weekend the judicial branch struck down the executive order. The Ninth Circuit of Appeals denied an appeal from the Trump administration to reinstate the ban Sunday, after U.S. District Court Judge James Robart (LAW ’73) suspended the order Saturday.
The order had suspended immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and refugees from Syria indefinitely.
DeGioia announced he had signed the letters in a post to his Facebook page Friday.
“Earlier this week, I joined other college and university presidents in signing letters regarding the January 27, 2017 Executive Order on ‘Protecting the Nation from Terrorist Entry into the United States,’” DeGioia wrote.
The first letter, organized by Princeton University, was addressed to Trump and signed by the presidents of 48 American universities, including Vanderbilt University, Columbia University and Stanford University.
The second letter was addressed to Kelly and signed by hundreds of institutions, all members of the American Council on Education. DeGioia has been Chair of the Board of Directors of ACE since March 2016.
The Princeton letter recommended that Trump take immediate action to change his decision to ban Muslims from seven majority-Muslim countries.
“We write as presidents of leading American colleges and universities to urge you to rectify or rescind the recent executive order closing our country’s borders to immigrants and others from seven majority-Muslim countries and to refugees from throughout the world,” the letter reads.
The letter also asserts America’s reputation as a free nation will be harmed globally if Trump does not take immediate action.
“American higher education has benefited tremendously from this country’s long history of embracing immigrants from around the world. Their innovations and scholarship have enhanced American learning. Many who have returned to their own countries have taken with them the values that are the lifeblood of our democracy,” they wrote. “This executive order is dimming the lamp of liberty and staining the country’s reputation. We respectfully urge you to rectify the damage done by this order.”
The second letter echoed much of the same sentiment as the first, with a focus on how international students benefit the domestic population.
“International exchange is a core value and strength of American higher education. Moreover, our nation’s welcoming stance to scholars and scientists has benefited the U.S. through goodwill and a long history of scientific and technological advances that have been essential to the economic growth our country has experienced for decades.”
In his initial campuswide email Jan. 29 denouncing Trump’s decision, DeGioia wrote about the need for interfaith cohesion on Georgetown’s campus.
“Guided by our mission, we have placed a special emphasis on interreligious dialogue and our openness to different faith traditions and cultures,” DeGioia wrote. “This includes our efforts to support a diverse and vibrant Muslim community on campus.”
DeGioia’s actions have been joined by other senior administrators.
Professor Charles King, who is the chair of the government department, said in a Jan. 29 email the department is working to support students and faculty affected by the order.
Additionally, School of Foreign Service Dean Joel Hellman wrote in a Jan. 29 email to SFS faculty that Trump’s order is “a challenge to the very values upon which the SFS was created and for which we have championed for nearly a century.”

The Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union and the Blue and Gray Tour Guide Society received 167 and 265 applications for their spring hiring classes.
GUASFCU fell one short of its spring applicant pool record, hiring 23 tellers out of the 167, at a rate of 13.8 percent, while Blue and Gray accepted 32 new tour guides, or 12.1 percent, from the 265.
Students of Georgetown, Inc. could not be reached for comment as of press time.
Each student group either tweaked or substantially changed its application process this semester in an effort to increase diversity.
Incoming GUASFCU CEO Rupert Kingshott (MSB ’18) said GUASFCU’s new hires are balanced in terms of gender and fell along usual school lines.
“The current teller class has a roughly even split between males and females. About half come from the MSB, with the rest being from the College or SFS. This is a similar proportion to our application pool,” Kingshott wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Blue and Gray President Prayuj Pushkarna (SFS ’17) said that Blue and Gray reduced the importance of the written element of its application and allowed general tour guides to interview prospective applicants in order to expand the number of voices participating in hiring.
The application has changed significantly since the fall, according to Pushkarna. In the fall hiring season, Blue and Gray offered the top 30 percent of written applications a first round interview, while in the spring, all applicants were offered an interview, with the top 30 percent of averaged written applications and first round interviews receiving second round interviews.
Pushkarna said Blue and Gray concluded that the nature of its role mandated that it give all applicants an interview.
“We realized it did not make as much sense to cut people after just the written application because as tour guides, our primary role is face-to-face contact,” Pushkarna said.
Outgoing GUASFCU CEO Chris Grillo (SFS ’17) said GUASFCU plans to continue to widen its outreach efforts.
“We’ve reached out to specific clubs and groups on campus that traditionally have not been very well represented within the intern ranks,” Grillo said.
One tangible step GUASFCU plans to take is to outreach to the office of the Georgetown Scholarship Program, which aids academically distinguished Georgetown students with financial needs.
“Next fall we’re going to fixate on holding office hours in the GSP office. That was a plan we did a little rollout on late into the application process this time around,” Grillo said. “There are plans to get everything scheduled so next year we will be in the GSP office as well.”
Rodrigo Ko (MSB ’20), who was rejected from Corp Accounting in the fall and was hired by Corp Marketing last week, said he did not perceive a huge change in The Corp’s application process from the fall to the spring.
“I don’t think it changed much, honestly. I was greeted with happy, energetic people,” Ko said. “All the interviewers were great, and I didn’t feel much pressure at all. Just my attitude toward the interview changed.”
Even considering the large applicant pool and supposedly imposing process, Ko said he had a great experience — through rejection and acceptance — with The Corp.
“I haven’t gone to an interview where I felt more at home,” Ko said.
[…] For example, the university supports organizations such as the Blue and Gray Tour Guide Society, which had a 12.1 percent acceptance rate last semester, and the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union, which accepted 13.8 percent […]
