Recent Georgetown graduate Nina May Brekelmans (GRD ‘15) died in an electrical fire in her home near Dupont Circle June 3. She was 25.
Michael Patrick McLoughlin, 24, also died in the fire, and five others were injured.
Although Sherri Kimbel, a representative from the Office of Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), identified both victims as Georgetown students at an ANC2F meeting Wednesday, McLoughlin was a University of Maryland graduate.
Brekelmans graduated from Georgetown last month with a Master of Arts in Arab Studies and hoped to live and work in the Middle East after graduation. Brekelmans, who was proficient in Arabic, was recently awarded a Fulbright grant to conduct research on female distance runners in Jordan. She received a bachelor’s degree in Arabic from Dartmouth College, where she graduated summa cum laude in 2012.
While at Georgetown, Brekelmans involved herself in the community, training as a distance runner with the Georgetown Running Club, serving as treasurer of Georgetown Women in International Affairs and interning at the Muslim Chaplaincy.
School of Foreign Service Interim Dean James Reardon-Anderson and Center for Contemporary Arab Studies Director Osama Abi-Mershed shared the news with the Georgetown community this afternoon in a campus-wide email.
“We are deeply saddened by this news and know that it is difficult for the many members of the Georgetown community who knew Nina,” Reardon-Anderson and Abi-Mershed wrote. “Please join our Georgetown community in remembering Nina’s family and friends in your thoughts and prayers during this time.”

From one Georgetown grad student to another, RIP. I didn’t know Berkelmans personally, but she sounds like an amazing person. 
Rest assured, you will not be forgotten. You have many friends, and the legacy you have left at Georgetown will continue to inspire others. For me, personally, we have similar interests (although mine are in Asia while hers are in the Middle East), but either way, thank you for showing me what can be accomplished in a young life.

Businessman William J. Doyle (CAS ’72) was elected as Georgetown’s next chair of the board of directors, effective July 1.
Doyle, the current vice chair, succeeds former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue (CAS ’62), who has served as chair since 2009. Tagliabue will remain on the board as its vice chair to provide counsel to Doyle as he adjusts to his new position.
Doyle, a senior advisor and former president and CEO of Potash Corporation, a fertilizer company, was officially elected as chair at the board’s June 4 meeting. He previously served on the board for seven years as its vice chair.
“We are pleased to welcome Bill as our incoming chair of Georgetown’s board of directors,” University President John J. DeGioia said in a press release. “Bill brings a wealth of experience and a gift for strategic thinking to the role of chair — he is an energetic and persuasive advocate for our university, and I look forward to continuing to work with him to advance our university’s priorities in the years to come.”
Doyle, who studied government at Georgetown as an undergraduate, has remained well-connected to the school since his graduation. In 2009, Doyle and his wife, Kathy, donated $10 million to the university to create the Doyle Engaging Difference Initiative, a program that aims to engage students in global learning pursuits. The program offers curriculum enrichment grants to allow professors to provide their students with activities outside of the classroom, like field trips, cultural dinners and performances. It also provides diversity grants to professors to help them better engage their students in issues of diversity and plurality.
In the past six years, almost 2,200 undergraduate students have taken 90 courses from Doyle Faculty Fellows in 28 different departments, according to the university press release.
Doyle also chairs Georgetown’s current capital campaign, which has raised $1.41 billion of its $1.5 billion goal since October 2011.
“As chair of the capital campaign, one thing for sure I’ve learned is … we have to really engage our alumni, our parents and our friends to support us like never before,” Doyle said in the press release. “We need them to really understand that great philanthropy and a global university go hand in hand.”

The decision came Thursday, as the third day of board meetings came to a close. GU Fossil Free, an organization dedicated to full divestment from fossil fuel companies, expressed disappointment with the vote in a statement released shortly following the announcement.
“GU Fossil Free maintains that this is not a victory,” the statement read.
Members of the organization, some coming from as far as Texas for the vote, held a sit-in in the hallway of the Leavey Center, just outside the board meeting.
The vote came at the end of a long year of campaigning by GU Fossil Free to encourage the university to divest from all its holdings in the top-200 fossil fuel companies. GU Fossil Free’s effort was acknowledged both in the resolution itself and in the statement released by the university.
The resolution affirmed the recommendations of a working group, created this past semester to examine divestment. The Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility voted in January against GU Fossil Free’s original proposal, instead recommending targeted divestment from the top-100 companies with the biggest environmental impact from coal mining operations.
The working group, established in April and composed of board members, was charged with evaluating CISR’s proposals and making recommendations. The group participated in videoconferencing with members of GU Fossil Free.
“The working group based their recommendations on deliberations, extensive analysis and the proposals put forward by GUFF and CISR,” the university’s official statement on the resolution said.
The final resolution states that the board of directors approved and adopted the working group’s recommendations in their entirety.
The board will select a committee, under the supervision of its executive committee, to examine the broader question of investments and social responsibility. The resolution also pledged to continue and strengthen the academic study of energy and the environment, as well as reduce its environmental footprint.
GU Fossil Free Member Caroline James (COL ’16) said she wanted to seek clarification with administrators about the details of the “special board committee” and the “regularized process,” as cited in the resolution.
Office of the President Chief of Staff Joseph Ferrara (GRD ’96) announced the decision to GU Fossil Free immediately following the vote. Ferrara addressed the group at their sit-in in the hallway.
“The board members got this document, the … final one, last night. Earlier versions of this had gotten to them — there were some additional discussions — so everybody had this in front of them,” Ferrara said. “[Board Chairman Paul Tagliabue (CAS ’62)] made some comments, President [John J.] DeGioia made some comments, they then turned it over to Bill Berkley, he then went around to the other working group members, Maurice Brenninkmeijer, Sister Carol [Keehan], etc. … and then it was sort of an open discussion for all board members. And then they voted and it was unanimous. … Alberto Beeck spoke up, Frank McCourt spoke up, Victor Wright, Jean Carey spoke up.”
Members of the board of directors did not respond to requests for comment.
Ferrara told the group he and Secretary of the University Ed Quinn would be willing to meet with them at 7 p.m to hold a question-and-answer session about the decision.
Members of the organization were less than content with the final result.
“I am very unhappy, I think this was a very, very tiny step that was taken pretty much because direct coal investments aren’t fabulous investments anyway, I think it was done to appease us,” GU Fossil Free member Caroline James (COL ’16) said. “It seems like a much bigger step than it actually represents. I appreciate that they have taken up this conversation but this is barely any kind of action at all.”
She added that she had a litany of questions for Ferrara on a range of problems with the resolution like vague language and more details on certain promises.
“Georgetown made a tiny baby step in the right direction by divesting only its direct holdings in coal,” GU Fossil Free member Elaine Colligan (SFS ’15) said. “But to my knowledge that could represent as little as less than one percent of the endowment. Michael Barry, the [Chief Investment Officer], told me verbatim that these investments were bad investments anyway.”
Colligan said that GU Fossil Free would continue to push for full divestment.
A spokesmen for the Independent Petroleum Association of America and the anti-divestment site Divestmentfacts.com, Matt Dempsey, stood off to the side of the sit-in.
“I think what you have is a school that took a really hard look at the divestment question, and ended up concluding, like the vast majority of other institutions being solicited by activists, that divesting from oil and gas is a really bad idea,” Dempsey wrote in an email. “Obviously, we would have preferred an outright rejection of the proposal out-of-hand, like Santa Clara University did this week, but no honest activist will consider this a victory.”
The Independent Petroleum Association of America funded a study that suggests that divestment hurts endowments. The New York Times noted that other studies have suggested both negligible and slightly positive effects.
University President John J. DeGioia sent a campus-wide email Thursday evening lauding the board’s decision.
“This most recent action by our board enables us to ever more deeply fulfill our responsibility to be caring stewards of the environment,” DeGioia wrote. “As a Catholic and Jesuit university, we are called to powerfully engage the world, human culture, and the environment—bringing to bear the intellectual and spiritual resources upon which our community is built.”
In addition, the Georgetown University Student Association President Joe Luther (COL ’16) and Vice President Connor Rohan (COL ’16) said in a press release that they believe the decision was a step in the right direction.
“I think it’s a really positive step for the university,” Luther said. “It’s something students have been very engaged with over these past few years, but I hope the conversation about how Georgetown could be more environmentally conscious and sustainable doesn’t end here.”
