Mark Smulson, professor of biochemistry at the Georgetown University School of Medicine died of a blood infection Sept. 4 at Georgetown University Hospital. He was 75 years old.
According to the Washington Post, Smulson, a research scientist, had been a member of the university since 1967. In addition to lecturing, he acted as a thesis advisor while training medical students, doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows.
He focused his research on the biochemical processes that allow normal cell growth and how these processes can result in cancer. He received the first Georgetown dean’s prize for his work in 1988.
Smulson was survived by his wife, Gudrun Jensen Sulson, his sons Kristoffer Smulson and ErikSmulson – the university’s vice president of public affairs – and four grandchildren.

When emerging comedian Donald Glover performed a stand-up show for a full house in Gaston Hall earlier this month, the Georgetown crowd went wild.
What the crowd didn’t know was that portions of Glover’s repertoire may not have been completely original.
In at least three instances during his Sept. 7 set, Glover made jokes reminiscent of bits done in past years by comedians Chris Rock and Patrice O’Neal.
Glover, who is best known for his role on the NBC series “Community,” made a contractual stipulation with the Georgetown Program Board that no audio or video could be recorded at the performance. Several attendees, however, were able to corroborate the content of his jokes.
One of the lines Glover delivered, a joke that has also has appeared on the website “College Humor,” goes: “When a girl leaves my home at eight and hasn’t called by 10 … I immediately think of ways to prove I didn’t kill her … like I go downstairs and buy like a bunch of tampons and I’m like ‘remember this face, [expletive],’ and I run out.”
On “Comedy Central Presents” in 2003, comic Patrice O’Neal said, “I never go more than a half an hour without buying something, cause you could kill somebody in a half hour and you need an alibi. So every 15 minutes I buy something … I’ll end up arguing with the clerk just so he remembers me.”
On the YouTube page for Glover’s video, numerous viewers have posted comments about its similarity to O’Neal’s routine.
In another bit at Georgetown, Glover made a joke that numerous members of the audience recall as, “White people never say [expletive] around black people, but I was at a Kanye West concert, and basically everyone in the crowd was white. Kanye was singing ‘All of the Lights,’ and the song goes ‘Something wrong/I hold my head/M.J. Gone…’ and then the white crowd all shouted, ‘Our [expletive] dead!'”
In his 2008 HBO special “Kill the Messenger,” Chris Rock joked, “There’s a lot of [expletive] in a Dr.Dre song, and white people want to enjoy it, but they can’t really enjoy it around me. So they start taking out the [expletive] or mumbling the [expletive], and it’s just a sad sight to see. But I know when I’m not there … They all sing along together ’cause I never hesitate to put a [expletive] on his back.'”
In another joke during the Gaston Hall show, Glover discussed how it is impossible to think about racism if it was propagated by babies. Glover joked that if he saw a baby dressed in Ku Klux Klan garb, he would still want to hug and fawn over him.
In 1989, Chris Rock said at a comedy club performance, “One thing I learned about racism is that everybody loves babies. You can’t hate a baby, man. I remember I was pushing my little brother [in a stroller] on the sidewalk in South Carolina, and these rednecks were standing there. I’m pushing him, and when I get up to the corner this redneck looks over and says, ‘Boy, that’s a pretty [expletive].'”
During a show on Comedy Central last year, Glover remarked that he idolized Chris Rock growing up and would often imitate his jokes as a child.
Nehemiah Markos (COL ’14), a member of the Georgetown Improv Association who performed as an opening stand-up act for Glover, defended the originality of Glover’s material, adding that proving joke theft is difficult.
“The line between homage and theft is thin, and sometimes you can’t tell if a comedian is being influenced by someone or if he is actually stealing their jokes,” he said.
In the world of stand-up comedy, stealing jokes has drawn criticism. Several high-profile comedians such as Dane Cook, the Wayans Brothers and Carlos Mencia have been accused of recycling jokes from other comics’ sets for their own routines.
Glover could not be reached for comment.

The McDonough School of Business and PricewaterhouseCoopers shed light on the recent financial regulatory shake-ups at the 2nd annual U.S. and Global Financial Reform Conference this Thursday.
Organized by the MSB’s Center for Financial Markets and Policy in the Rafik B. Hariri Building, the conference presented five keynote speakers and four panel discussions. All the talks focused on the impact of the new market rules, according to Reena Aggarwal, director of the center and business professor.
“The objective is to bring policy makers, regulators and academic scholars together, to discuss the status of new financial regulations and the challenges/opportunities for financial institutions,” Aggarwal wrote in an email.
The conference’s panelists included many leading policy-makers, legal officials, professors, bankers and other market professionals from the government, universities and private firms. The participants’ expertise centered on financial regulation, like the Dodd-Frank Bill passed by Congress and signed into law by President Obama in 2010 and the effects of the regulation’s implications.
The audience was comprised largely of those also knowledgeable in financial reforms, with a varied collection of people from academia and finance in attendance.
The first two panels dealt with issues regarding a new classification of certain financial institutions like large insurers, while the third and fourth panels dealt with the impact of new regulations on capital markets and consumer regulations respectively.
Adam Levitin, professor of law at Georgetown, spoke about consumer regulations and expressed his approval of the rules when asked about the effectiveness of the Dodd-Frank regulations.
“[Dodd-Frank] gets it right on the structural side,” Levitin said. “It creates a regulatory structure that covers pretty much all consumer financial players.”
The conference’s keynote speakers included Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodities Futures and Trading Commission, who discussed how his commission was enacting new safety measures. The commission encouraged rules such as encouraging whistleblowers and applying more stringent regulations to organizations that exchange banks’ money by forcing them to pool data to form a public national database.
Gensler then held a question and answer session for members of the media.

The Student Activities Commission will revamp its funding allocation system this semester after a system implemented last year drew criticism from student groups.
The changes could be implemented as early as next semester if details of a new plan are ironed out by the beginning of November, commissioners announced at a town hall on Wednesday.
Students at the meeting said they hoped a consensus could be reached in time for that deadline.
“I really applaud you guys for starting this conversation early,” said Emma Green (COL ’12), former treasurer for the Philodemic Society. “I think it’s really important that this is a really fast and on-the-ball process.”
A new system — which would entirely overhaul the guidelines — emerged as the favorite of the plans presented among club leaders at the town hall.
The comprehensive funding system would require student groups to submit a line-item style budget for approval, with the goal of allowing students to request funds that more accurately fit their organizational goals. One of the major complaints against the current system, in which groups are required to submit a programming arc detailing the events they will hold for the semester, is that it does not allow students enough flexibility.
“There seems to be a consensus on the kind of plan we should be working on,” SAC Vice Chair Ruiyong Chen (SFS ’13) said.
The comprehensive system would be similar to what many other schools as well as other funding boards at Georgetown — such as the Center for Social Justice’s Advisory Board for Student Funding — use to allocate their funds.
“There’s absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t be able to institute the sort of rigorous system that many of our peer institutions use in the next month or two,” said Eitan Paul (SFS ’12), who spearheaded a movement to reform the allocation process while serving as chairman of the International Relations Club last year.
The new funding allocation system was implemented last year with the aim of allowing SAC to more fully fund student group requests and streamline the process, but the new guidelines were a source of frustration for many club leaders. Last spring about one-third of SAC groups signed on to two open letters calling for a series of revisions to the allocation system, prompting SAC to begin a series of reforms.
SAC Chair Andy Koenig (COL ’12) said that while he did not want to leave groups stranded next semester if a new system was incomplete, he thought that there was a strong possibility that the guidelines could be worked out in time.
In light of the funding disputes last year, the Georgetown University Student Association recently launched its Report on Student Life, which is focused on funding board reform this year. However, the report is not scheduled to be released until the end of the fall semester, and SAC hopes to have a plan finalized by early November. Chen said she did not think the report would affect the timing of the reform process.
“I think this is the appropriate time to work on it,” she said.
Commissioners stressed that they wanted the new guidelines to be both fair and feasible.
“We hope that this is a system that will last five, 10 years — that will sustain at Georgetown,” said Carlos DelaTorre (COL ’13), a SAC commissioner.
Despite the possibility of a new funding allocation system, concerns about the underlying structure for student programming remain. For example, when club leaders said they were unable to access their club cost centers online to track their funds, Koenig said SAC was not able to either.
“The university infrastructure isn’t there yet,” he said.

While the District saw a moderate reduction in 2010 violent crime levels, reports of forcible rape jumped 25 percent, according to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report released on Monday.
Forcible rapes numbered 187, which is 37 more than the previous year. According to Metropolitan Police Department crime statistics, 10 of those incidents occurred in Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, which includes Georgetown and Burleith.
Overall, D.C.’s numbers of violent crime dropped from 7,586 in 2009 to 7,468 in 2010, a two percent decrease.
The FBI report, which was compiled from figures collected at the local, city and federal levels, pointed to similar crime trends across the country. In the last year, national rates of violent crime decreased by 6 percent totalling 1,246,248 incidents.
With a violent crime rate of 1,241 incidents per 100,000 residents, the District is more statistically dangerous than the hometowns of many peer institutions. The Boston and South Bend, Ind. metro areas, home to Boston College and the University of Notre Dame respectively, had rates of 903 and 716 per 100,000 residents.
Yale’s New Haven, Conn. had a per 100,000 rate of 1,595, making it the most violent city in Connecticut.
However, New Haven saw significantly fewer forcible rapes than the District did, with 70 incidents for 2010. Boston and South Bend saw 256 and 52 incidents respectively.

Three students accused of destroying office ceilings in the Leavey Center last month signed a prosecution agreement Wednesday morning that will prevent their case from going to trial.
The students, Sam Buckley (COL ’14), John Flanagan (SFS ’14) and Eric Pilch (COL ’12), were charged with the destruction of property less than $1,000; Buckley and Pilch were also each charged with a misdemeanor of unlawful entry.
Chief Judge Rufus King III, who presided over the preliminary hearing, determined that the case would not go to a full criminal trial.
King scheduled the diversion status hearing for Jan. 25, allowing the case to be settled outside the court and giving the defendants a four-month probationary period.
Buckley, Flanagan and Pilch had previously pleaded not guilty of all charges.
The prosecution alleged that the defendants attempted to evade Department of Public Safety officers on Aug. 28 by crawling through the drop ceiling in The Georgetown Voice’s office on the fourth floor of the Leavey Center. The Hoya reported on Sept. 20 that the trio caused over $4,000 in repair expenses. The trio gained access to The Voice’s office through a punch code, as Buckley and Flanagan were Voice staffers at the time.
During the assigned probation period, the students must follow the established diversion program while demonstrating good behavior. The criteria of the specific diversion program was not publicly available.
The defendants were also notified that failure to appear in court on Jan. 25 would result in the issuing of a bench warrant, a type of arrest warrant issued by the court when a defendant fails to comply with a court order or requirement.
King warned the defendants of the possible repercussions of failing to maintain good behavior.
“For the three of you, this is going to be a little unusual because you’re used to probably occasionally breaking the rules and sliding a little bit, but in this case you can’t break the rules,” he said. “If you don’t do exactly what they require of you, this [agreement] falls apart and you go to trial.”

It’s Tuesday night, and Geraldine Miranda (SFS ’13) waves goodbye to the van that has dropped her off in front of the small apartment in Chinatown where she tutors twice a week.
She knocks on the door, and her two tutees, Johnny, age seven, and Danny, age nine, run to open it; shouting her name as she enters the apartment.
As part of the D.C. Schools Project, one of the title programs of the Center for Social Justice, Miranda is just one of the 200 Georgetown students who go out into the District weekly to tutor students in need of extra help. In the 27 years since its inception, the program has risen in popularity, exploding from 15 students to its current membership. For volunteers, the program has become an invaluable part of their lives as they teach — and learn — from their tutees.
“I’m making a personal and tangible difference in my tutees’ lives that the D.C. public school [system] does not provide,” Rebecca Yang (SFS ’12) said.
Offering academic support for kids from low-income backgrounds who need support beyond what their public schools can offer, Georgetown students can provide the extra tutoring to kick-start these students’ academic success.
“Schools love us,” DCSP’s Interim Director Carlos Ojeda (MSB ’11) said. “They want us to keep coming.”
Ojeda pointed out, however, that Georgetown students themselves have a lot to gain from the program.
“Georgetown is a bubble. It’s very, very different than the outside world. Going out and seeing the rest of D.C. will not only raise your awareness of social issues, but can prepare students for the real world,” he said.
Student Coordinator Liliana Pichardo (MSB ’12) echoed his sentiments.
“[The program] is a great way to get off campus and really learn about immigration issues, the public school system, and what’s going on in other cultures. It’s an eye-opening experience,” she said.
But the program has its share of complications, mainly stemming from its lack of transportation resources. Ojeda said that the program shares buses with the entire Center for Social Justice, which limits the number of buses available exclusively to DCSP.
“If [the buses] are full, we just can’t help more people,” he said. “I think with the right leadership and more resources, we can continue to grow.”
Miranda herself ran into transportation issues her first two years in the program.
Though she was eager to take part in DCSP when she arrived on campus her freshman year, Miranda, who uses a wheelchair, was disappointed to find that the CSJ did not have a handicap accessible van in light of their van shortages. For her first two years at Georgetown, Miranda could only take part in the project’s on-campus programs.
Still, she was determined to work with her tutees in their own homes.
“I really wanted to go out and teach students in their homes, where they feel comfortable. I wanted that to be possible,” she said.
Last year, at Miranda’s urging, university officials secured the wheelchair-accessible van that transports her to Johnny and Danny’s apartment each week.
At Tuesday night’s session, both boys competed fiercely in a game of vocabulary bingo. Afterward, she read to them from “The Magic School Bus” and assigned them vocabulary exercises for the following week.
On the ride home, Miranda boasted about the boys’ improvements, visibly excited as she described the advanced material that Johnny was reading and Danny’s growing confidence in his abilities.
Just like Miranda, Yang spoke to the visible impact she sees in the kids’ academic progress.
“A lot of my students get lost in the cracks, and I feel like I can bring them back up again, little by little.”

Councilmember At-Large Phil Mendelson denounced Georgetown’s 2010 Campus Plan in a Sept. 16 letter to the D. C. Zoning Commission.
In the letter, Mendelson claimed that Georgetown’s 40 percent enrollment increase over the past 10 years has contributed to adverse conditions in the surrounding neighborhoods.
“I join the adjacent communities in expressing serious concern that the university’s proposed plan does not adequately address and mitigate those impacts,” he wrote. “I urge the Zoning Commission to reject the plan as filed and protect the quality of life in our communities.”
Mendelson echoed the D.C. Office of Planning and several members of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E in urging Georgetown to house all “traditional undergraduates” on campus.
The university released an official reply to Mendelson’s concerns, promising to address all stakeholders in the campus plan process.
“Throughout this process, we have listened to our neighbors and responded to their concerns. We have made investments that are improving the quality of life for students and neighbors,” the statement said. “That is our commitment, and we will continue to do that.”
Mendelson’s rejection of the Campus Plan came just weeks after he voiced support for the university in opposition to the ANC’s redistricting proposal.
He called the plan, which would group a disproportionately high number of individuals in the two single-member districts that encompass the Georgetown campus, “grossly discriminatory.”
“Lumping students into one or two grossly oversized single-member districts and then having non-students in the remaining undersized SMDs … would be a violation of the law,” he told the Georgetown Current on Aug. 31.
Jake Sticka (COL ’13), the student commissioner on ANC2E, said that he was not surprised by Mendelson’s new position on the Campus Plan.
“Mendelson is generally conservative about land use issues, and his opinion on the campus plan is consistent with [that],” Sticka said.
He added that Mendelson’s comments about the university’s plan did not suggest that he had withdrawn his support for Georgetown in the redistricting debate.
“Councilmember Mendelson considers each issue in very different spheres,” Sticka said.
Sticka stressed that, despite this setback, he is hopeful that Mendelson and other councilmembers will acknowledge the generous concessions that Georgetown has made to its campus plan in recent months.
“Despite what [Mendelson] said, … we do see that the campus plan is a modest plan, especially considering concessions that have been made,” he said. “Hopefully as the hearings in November play out, [he] too will see that this is a modest plan.”
Mendelson’s office could not be reached for comment.

Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) reflected on her experiences as an openly gay politician and the difficulties of working in a Congress split down party lines Wednesday night.
“This year, I have never been so depressed to be in the minority,” Baldwin said at the event in White-Gravenor Hall organized by the Georgetown University College Democrats and GU Pride.
In describing the challenges of a partisan Congress, she spoke about working among colleagues who she believes do not value their constituents over political games.
“I’m not saying cutting our debt isn’t important, but there’s not one member of congress who doesn’t have constituents struggling at home,” she said.
In her current campaign for the U.S. Senate, Baldwin aims to highlight the importance of bipartisanship and allegiance to her voters in Wisconsin, not just to the politics of Washington.
“I have to remain optimistic that our democracy can operate for us. That’s why I’m running for Senate — we have to wrest control back,” she said. “You don’t seek office if you don’t think democracy can work.”
In past campaigns, according to Baldwin, she has had her critics, but she has overcome those issues to win each race. As the November election looms closer, she is again facing many who doubt her ability to win an entire state of voters who seem to be engaged in aggressive political competition.
“Who are these talking heads telling us we can’t win?” Baldwin asked. “Last time I checked, we go to the ballot box.”
Baldwin also stressed that her sexuality in no way discredits her commitment to her political values and desire to reach across the aisle. She was the first openly gay candidate to be elected to Congress in 1998.
“It is personally offensive when somebody talks about [the LGBTQ community] as though they are ‘less than,'” she said. “But when you do a job like this, you also have to relate to these people on a regular basis. You can’t call the boss and say ‘this person needs counseling.'”
When faced with obstacles like these, Baldwin said she takes every opportunity to impart a lesson to her challengers.
“You find an educable moment, and you seize it,” Baldwin said. “It’s important to use private moments when the C-SPAN cameras aren’t rolling.”

Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J. had more on his plate this summer than preparing for his new role as vice president of mission and ministry. He was also prepping for the publication of his first book.
O’Brien’s work, “The Ignatian Adventure: Experiencing the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius in Daily Life,” was released by Loyola Press at the beginning of this month.
Four years ago, O’Brien began writing a compilation of personal stories meant to complement the history of Saint Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus who authored “Spiritual Exercises” in the 1500s after a series of personal encounters with Jesus.
“[My] book stems from my experience of offering the ‘Spiritual Exercises’ to people, to students and parishioners at my old parish, Holy Trinity,” O’Brien said.
Typically, the “Exercises” — “the foundation of Jesuit spiritual values,” according to O’Brien — are led by a spiritual director and performed over a period of 30 days. For O’Brien, in the modern-day context and with those he mentors spiritually, such a timeline is impractical.
“Jesuits meet people where they are at,” he said.
The purpose of The Ignation Adventure is to guide people in their day-to-day encounters with God, helping them locate the source of spirituality in their lives.
“Jesuit spirituality is based on the belief that we can find God in all things,” O’Brien said.
According to O’Brien, the book also helped him transition into his new role as vice president of mission and ministry.
“No Jesuit is able to help others unless they grow spiritually themselves,” he said. “So in my new role as vice president of mission and ministry, I rely on the ‘Exercises’ every day because if I am not rooted in the love that God has for me [and] if I am not attentive to my own interior life, I am not going to be able to do my job well, which is to help people and to help this university understand its soul.”
The book is intended for those living harried lives, according to O’Brien.
“You don’t need to be perfectly devout to make the ‘Spiritual Exercises’,” he said. “You need to be generous and to have a generosity of soul. When you are open to generosity and open to God leading you, you are ready to start making the Exercises.”
The use of personal stories and tips is intended to help facilitate readers to grow in self-awareness, O’Brien said.
“Discernment is all about an interior motion — the things we feel moving within us. Discern where it came from and only act on ones that move you closer to God and to faith, hope and love,” O’Brien said.

The Department of Homeland Security unveiled a new website last week to help ease the admission process for international students applying to American universities.
According to Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, the Study in the States website will be a “one-stop shop” for international students looking for relevant information about student visa and exchange visitor programs.
“Attracting the best and brightest international talent to our colleges and universities is an important part of our nation’s economic, scientific and technological innovation and competitiveness,” Napolitano said in a press release.
Study in the States provides students with a variety of resources, ranging from what to expect upon arriving at a U.S. port of entry to information on applying for a student visa. Prior to the website’s launch, students had to navigate between sites from multiple government agencies in order to find the materials they needed, often receiving conflicting information.
DHS intends for the website to be interactive, linking with social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.
The website also features a blog with videos, public service announcements, relevant news and helpful tips.
The university’s Director of International Student and Scholar Services Helene Robertson said that if students can find the information they need in one convenient location, they will avoid less authentic sources.
“There are a lot of companies and immigration attorneys who are looking to make some money off of international students by giving them the same information that they could find for free on a government site,” Robertson said.
Robertson said that she thinks Georgetown’s Office of International Programs, which provides a number of support services to international students, could benefit from the website’s centralized source of information.
“A challenge that a lot of universities face is making sure that the information they give to students is up-to-date and reflects the latest thinking of the government. If Study in the States is consistently updated and accurate, then we don’t need to do as much here,” she said, adding that this new website will enable her and her staff to spend more time advising students.
Shuo Yan Tan (SFS ’12), who came to D.C. from Singapore, said the website would have been helpful during his application process to Georgetown.
“What would have made my experience easier would be a centralized database on all aspects of U.S. schools, such as academics, food, weather and student life,” he said.
Lynn Screen, director of admissions for Georgetown’s English as a Foreign Language program, which brings over 400 English language learners to campus each year, said the site will make entering the United States easier for students who are still developing their English language skills.
“Up until now, it has been up to the EFL department to explain these processes and rules to our students in a manner that even low-level English students can understand,” Screen said, noting that many necessary processes — such as filling out forms — can be especially confusing for EFL students.
“Study in the States addressed these issues as they pertain to this special population. I hope this new website will empower my students to help themselves better navigate our system,” she added.

A new campus group has taken up the cause to help underprivileged high school students reach their college dreams.
Created in 2006 by Michael Carter, a student at Washington University in St. Louis, the Strive for College Collaborative is now a nationally recognized non-profit group that works to develop a mentoring relationship among undergraduates and high school students. The organization focuses on those students capable of attending college but lacking in the sufficient resources or encouragement.
Chris Stromeyer (SFS ’14), chair of Strive chapter’s Internal Relations committee, stressed the importance of helping underprivileged students in the D.C. area.
“The goal is to empower low-income high school students to achieve their potential,” he said.
Director of Public Relations, Marketing and Fundraising Brigid McCurdy (COL ’14) reiterated the group’s central focus.
“Last year, over 400,000 students nationwide graduated and were capable of attending college but lacked the resources to attend college. It is our goal to bridge that gap,” she said.
The first informational meeting for the group yielded over 50 students, all of whom the organization hopes to retain as mentors. The chapter plans to launch officially in the spring.
“The national chapter advises us to start at one school. Upon success at one school, we will expand from there,” McCurdy said. “In the future, we hope to see the organization at more than one public high school in D.C. and to reach a level where the percentage of students mentored and attending college stays as close to 100 percent as possible.”
Alex Berg (SFS ’14), the chair of the external relations committee, has been in contact with four public high schools in D.C. in hopes of localizing the national Strive curriculum.
The organization of Strive on high school campuses fosters one to one relationships between college volunteers and high school students. Mentors meet with their high school peers for one hour a week, helping them as they choose the schools to which they will apply and sending in the finished applications and enrollment fees.
“The external relations committee is working to determine which school would be most compatible with the Strive curriculum,” Berg said. “Not only have we all experienced the application process already; as mentors we can change lives and see results directly.”

Members of Congress called for the creation of a national center for campus security and protocol training last Thursday.
The Center to Advance, Monitor and Preserve University Security Safety Act of 2011, endorsed by Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), was drafted to connect colleges with one another so they could share effective safety plans and procedures.
Supporters hope that the legislation, which has been passed over by the last two sessions of Congress, will be signed into law during the current session. It is currently pending the House’s approval.
According to Scott, the purpose of the center is to create a “one stop shop” for schools to share reliable and useful information, creating a nationwide community working to prevent violent crimes.
“It makes little sense to require the thousands of institutions of higher education to individually go through the cost and effort to develop comprehensive plans,” Scott said when introducing the bill in June.
The CAMPUS Act already has the support of the two largest safety organizations in the country, including the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators.
The center would provide Congress and the Attorney General annual reports of campus activities. Universities currently report crime data to the Department of Education under the 1990 Clery Act.
As an additional incentive to promote safety precautions and faster emergency response on campuses, the bill would allow the center to award grants to universities to ensure that more rigorous safety goals are reached.
As a member of IACLEA, Georgetown has endorsed plans for the center.
Rocco DelMonaco, Georgetown’s vice president for university safety, said that the act will help provide public safety officers at universities with training specific to the job.
According to Rachel Pugh, director of media relations, however, Georgetown’s Department for Public Safety already requires all of its safety officers to complete extensive training, which includes 80 hours of orientation, a field-training program and a probationary period.

Catholic University’s administration defended its plan to institute single gender dorms before the D.C. Office of Human Rights last Thursday.
The legal proceedings began after The George Washington University law professor John Banzhaf filed litigation against Catholic University, claiming that the policy is a form of gender discrimination and violates the D.C. Human Rights Act.
Catholic University President John Garvey announced the plan for universal non-coed housing in an editorial in The Wall Street Journal in June.
“Here is one simple step colleges can take to reduce both binge drinking and hooking up: Go back to single-sex residences,” he wrote in the editorial.
He called the move a “slightly old-fashioned remedy that will improve the practice of virtue.”
In a statement to The Tower, Catholic University’s student newspaper, Associate Vice President for Public Affairs Victor Nakas said that the administration will stand behind its policy.
“We remain confident that under local and federal law we have every right to move forward with same-sex dorms,” he said.
Banzhaf also plans to sue two of the university’s prominent administrators, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the Archbishop of Washington, and Msgr. Allen Vigneron, the archbishop of Detroit. Wuerl is the ex officio chancellor of the university and Vigneron is the chairman of its board of trustees.
Banzhaf said that Catholic University’s new policy is unacceptable regardless of the school’s religious affiliation.
“Unfortunately for [Garvey], he cannot rely upon religion, because the D.C. Court of Appeals has held — in a case in which Georgetown University tried to justify discrimination based upon sexual orientation because of fundamental and strongly held Catholic teachings about homosexuality — that religious motivations were irrelevant, and no defense, under the statute,” Banzhaf said in a press release, recalling Georgetown’s checkered past with the Human Rights Act.
In 1977 and 1979, Georgetown rejected proposals from the Gay People of Georgetown University to be officially recognized as a student organization.
After a third refusal, GPGU, along with the Gay Rights Coalition, waged a lawsuit in 1980 against Georgetown stating that the university was in violation of the Human Rights Act. The Supreme Court ultimately found that Georgetown’s Catholic beliefs were not a justified basis for denying GPGU proper recognition.
According to Georgetown’s Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, single-sex dorms are not in Georgetown’s future.
“Coed residence halls with single-gender living units and bathrooms are welcoming and comfortable, providing the right balance of community living spaces and privacy that is important to students on our campus. Options are available to both male and female students who have a preference to live on a single-sex floor,” she wrote in an email.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson added that the university has tried to find a way to fulfill obligations to its students and to its religion.
“The structure we set up in our residence halls is focused on building community. … In designing these residences, we focus on our students’ needs and are supportive of the university’s mission,” Olson said. “Our residences are supportive of the Catholic and Jesuit tradition.”

Campaigns for the Georgetown University Student Association senate kicked off on Tuesday, with 56 students vying for 25 open spots this academic year. Two districts have no declared candidates and five districts are uncontested.
In the race, first-year districts are some of the most competitive. Village C West has six declared candidates competing for one spot while New South has eight students vying for that dorm’s seat.
“The freshmen dorms are usually much more competitive. This year is another example of that trend,” GUSA Election Commissioner Adam Giansiracusa (SFS ’12) said.
No students are running for the Henle 1-48 district, and the off-campus district only has two declared candidates for three spots. According to Giansiracusa every election in recent memory has had open seats at voting time.
“Typically, it’s the upperclassmen dorms that are less competitive,” Giansiracusa said.
When no one is running for a seat, there exists a possibility that, like in any district, a write-in candidate can win. However if no one is elected to a seat, the senate then issues a writ of election to hold a by-election, Giansiracusa said.
“It’s the same process we use if a senator resigns or if something happens during the year,” he said.
Jay Factor (COL ’14), who lives in the Henle 1-48 district, said that he was not sure how a write-in candidate would fare in the election.
“I would kind of just pick someone I know from our neighbors, unless someone ran an actual campaign,” he said. “Maybe I’ll run.”
Candidates in contested districts are working to rally support for their platforms before the election on Sept. 29. Max Gottlieb (COL ’14), a current senator who is running for re-election, expressed high hopes for GUSA in the upcoming term.
“I believe we have a great, fantastic opportunity that other GUSA members and GUSA bodies have not had to really make a huge difference — not just for our generation, but for future Georgetown students’ experiences,” he said.

After a year-long hiatus, the Residential Judicial Council is back in action after undergoing a series of revisions designed to make it more accessible to the student body.
According to Ed Gilhool, associate director of the Office of Residence Life, the year-long break was time well spent.
“Now, there are more opportunities for student investment and an increase in the number of cases that will go before the council,” he said.
The RJC was originally created in 1999 as a way for students to have a hand in dealing with the student conduct issues that arose during that school year. The body hears student code of conduct cases of category A and some category B violations, doling out sanctions and punishments. Operating similarly to the Honor Council, the RJC is meant to encourage an atmosphere of student responsibility, accountability and trust around campus.
In recent years, however, after lack of student interest and falling case rates, in 2009 the university announced that the organization would cease to operate for a year while structural changes were made. A steering committee held town halls and created a plan for a new council, which was approved at the end of last year.
In order to increase student involvement, the council introduced elections for the student-held positions on the council, which is composed of 12 student representatives along with administrative officials, residential administrators and hall directors. Until this year, the student seats on the council were filled on a volunteer basis.
“I’m excited to see how RJC will operate with its new structure. While the intention of the council was always good, it clearly needed to operate under a different format,” said Tyler Sax (COL ’13), a former Georgetown University Student Association senator.
Dalvin Butler (COL ’13), Interhall’s vice president of external affairs, said the elections represent a shift for the council.
“There will definitely be more student input that will provide a different approach to the system, but I think the disciplinary actions that the RJC will take will be practically the same as it has been in the past,” Butler said.
According to Gilhool, the council is still working on a recruitment plan to select three freshmen to serve this year. Applications will soon be posted on the Office of Residence Life’s website.
For sophomores and freshmen who entered the university while the council was not operating, the RJC may be an unknown entity.
“After taking a year off, RJC definitely has some work to do before they become a ‘household name’ around campus again,” Sax said.
But some students see promise in the new, revised council.
“Anytime there is a democratically elected group of students who are motivated and responsible, there are definitely going to be positive results from that,” Jack Miossi (COL ’15) said. “I’m excited to see what happens.”

The School of Foreign Service plans to offer undergraduate students a way to delve deeper into the curriculum through the Mortara Undergraduate Research Fellow program starting next semester.
With the help of the Dean’s Leadership Fund, fellows will be paid $9 per hour to research, collaborating with faculty for semester-long research projects. The pilot version will be open to a mix of 12 freshmen and sophomores. While there are other on-campus opportunities for faculty mentorship, the Mortara program seeks to distinguish itself by retaining its student researchers, according to Dean of the School of Foreign Service Carol Lancaster.
“It is a new opportunity for undergraduates, and this [is] a pilot year,” Lancaster said. “We’ll see how big it gets. It depends on the number of faculty that hope to get involved, but we expect to support three or four students this year.”
Faculty have expressed interest in guiding undergraduates of all levels through the research experience because they hope to breed scholars who understand the world of formal experimentation and analysis.
“The School of Foreign Service has the finest undergraduates studying global affairs in the world, but we don’t always provide our students with a full range of rich intellectual experiences outside the classroom,” said Kathleen McNamara, the director of the Mortara Center and a faculty mentor.
James Vreeland, an associate professor in the SFS, expressed similar sentiments.
“Personally, I am interested in co-authoring papers with students. I find that I can best mentor students through a truly collaborative project,” Vreeland said. “The students also learn what it takes to go through the arduous process of publishing in an academic journal. The standards are high and require devotion to work. On top of that, they get paid for their work.”
Vreeland will be a faculty mentor with the program after acting as one of the key associates in the initiative’s start-up.
Fellows will be required to spend anywhere from 10 to 15 hours per week helping professors with library and online research, editing written work and collecting and analyzing data.
According to McNamara, the participating professors will nominate students from SFS freshman pro-seminar courses during the fall semester.
The original idea was borne out of the visible success of the Carroll Round, the university’s undergraduate economics research conference, she said.
“The Carroll Round has shown that there is appetite and ability for outstanding independent research among undergraduates,” McNamara said. “The fellowship program has the potential to deepen student engagement by empowering them as generators, not just consumers, of knowledge.”
The Mortara fellows’ research is slated to culminate in an Annual Research Colloquium.
