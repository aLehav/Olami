	Medical education leader Ronald Harden received the Cura Personalis Award at the Sixth Annual Georgetown University Medical Center Convocation on Tuesday afternoon.	Harden, who is professor emeritus of medical education at the University of Dundee and professor of medical education at Al-Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic University, developed new approaches to curriculum planning, assessment, teaching and learning. In particular, he is best known for developing the Objective Structured Clinical Examination, which has now become a universal standard to assess clinical competence.	“[Harden] has made significant and innovative contributions to the academy, deepening excellence in medical education and enhancing their teaching and learning,” University President John J. DeGioia said.	The Cura Personalis Award, GUMC’s highest honor, awards a health professional whose contributions to the health care field are guided by compassion and service.	“Certainly it will be, among my awards, one of the ones which I will cherish the most,” Harden said.	Harden’s keynote presentation focused on the need for a transformation in medical education.	“Professional education has not kept pace with the challenges … in health care provision, largely because of a fermented, outdated and static curricula that produces ill-equipped graduates,” Harden said.	To combat this, Harden stressed the importance of personalized learning, increased collaboration and a continuation of education and professionalism.	Additionally, 11 faculty members and five students were honored during the convocation for achievements in research, service and education.	Interim GUMC Associate Vice President Anatoly Dritschilo, who has been at the medical center for 34 years, was recognized for his lifetime contribution. Dritschilo was the founding chair of the Department of Radiation, where his laboratory research focused on radiation biology, overcoming treatment resistance and prostate cancer.	“The fact that Dr. Dritschilo has spent nearly his entire career at Georgetown demonstrates his long-term commitment to his research goals and his devotion to this institution,” GUMC Executive Vice President for Health Sciences Howard Federoff, the event’s moderator, said.	Jenny Van Kirk (MED ’14) was honored for her achievements in the Georgetown University School of Medicine. Van Kirk, who holds a leadership position at the Hoya Clinic, will graduate as a Health Justice Scholar this May and pursue training in internal medicine. Van Kirk’s work has focused on community outreach and care and referral of hundreds of homeless families in Washington, D.C.	“This event is a really good symbol of the mission of the medical center in general,” Van Kirk said. “To be honored at a ceremony like this is really humbling.”	Alexander Adams (NHS ’14) was also honored for outstanding student achievement. Adams, a human science major, is the lead tutor in human biology, an EMT and a research assistant under the supervision of pharmacology and physiology associate professor Gerard Ahern and human science assistant professor Maureen Basha.	“It means a lot coming during the fall of my senior year, in the middle of medical school applications,” Adams said. “Getting this award now from the medical center is really an honor.”	In addition, 18 members of the clinical faculty were recognized for 20 years of service to patients and students.	“This gathering is an important moment for our medical center to both celebrate our work and achievements and to provide for us a moment of pause – a moment to reflect and recommit ourselves to our shared mission,” DeGioia said.

	Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State John Kerry and former first lady Laura Bush convened in Gaston Hall to discuss Afghan women Friday.	The event, “Advancing Afghan Women: Promoting Peace and Progress in Afghanistan,” was co-sponsored by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, the U.S.-Afghan Women’s Council, the George W. Bush Institute and the Alliance to Support the Afghan People.	Many seats in Gaston Hall were reserved for specified guests, and many students who had lined up for the 10 a.m. event as early as 5:50 a.m. did not get in.	University President John J. DeGioia offered opening remarks on the progress that has been made so far through partnerships between U.S. and Afghan organizations.	“It is a privilege for Georgetown to have the opportunity to contribute to this critical work,” DeGioia said. “Sustaining and building upon these gains remains critical especially as Afghan citizens face significant transition. In this context, today’s gathering has an added urgency.”	In his opening remarks, Kerry also addressed the progress made since 2001, including an influx of technology, educational opportunities for young women and access to health care.	“Today, 80 percent of Afghan women now have access to a cell phone,” Kerry said. “They are connected to their friends and families, but, most importantly, they are connected to the world and to their futures.”	However, Kerry submitted that, moving forward, the future of security in Afghanistan would be largely dependent on the opportunities afforded to its women.	“We all know that creating opportunities for women isn’t just the right thing to do – it’s a strategic necessity. Societies where women are safe, these societies are more prosperous and more stable – not occasionally, but always,” Kerry said.	Following Kerry’s remarks, Anita Haidary, a senior at Mount Holyoke and co-founder of Young Women for Change, a Kabul-based organization for female empowerment, took the stage with several accomplished Afghan women, including activists Palwasha Hassan and Nilofar Sakhi, Opus Prize winner Sakena Yacoobi and Shabana Basij-Rasikh, the current managing director of the School of Leadership, Afghanistan.	The symposium continued with a roundtable moderated by Melanne Verveer (FLL ’66, GRD ’69), executive director of the GUIWPS and former Clinton aid, with Bush and Clinton.	Both Bush and Clinton emphasized the critical nature U.S. support for Afghanistan will play after all U.S. troops are removed in 2014.	“Once our troops leave, the eyes of the U.S. will move away, and we can’t let that happen,” Bush said.	During the roundtable, Verveer posed questions submitted by Afghan students at the University of Kabul, who were able to participate in the symposium via videoconference.	Clinton responded to a student’s question regarding raising awareness of the needs of Afghan women in the absence of security by stressing the importance of the bilateral agreement the United States looks to sign with Afghanistan in coming weeks.	“We won’t know what we can do or how we can respond until we get a response [from Karzai],” Clinton said.	In the second half of the symposium, USAID administrator Rajiv Shah, Minister of Foreign Affairs for Norway BÃ? ¸rge Brende, and NATO Secretary General’s Special Representative for Women, Peace, and Security Mari SkÃ? ¥re offered remarks on the work their respective organizations and countries are doing to advance opportunities for women in Afghanistan. Brende assured the audience that his country’s continued support for Afghanistan would not be fazed by troop withdrawal in 2014.	“The women of Afghanistan have glimpsed the chance of a better future,” Brende said.	“You can count on Norway’s continued support of your important work. We will be there next year, but also in 2018.”	In closing the discussion, Clinton urged Georgetown students and those in Kabul to take initiative in forging cross-cultural bonds.	“I would love to have Georgetown students talk with one another about what you can do to support [Afghan students],” Clinton said. “The more we can link up our university communities – those make a tremendous difference in validating the work that is being done.”

	Analysis of Epicurean & Co.’s buffet pricing features a flat rate for food options, allowing restaurant patrons to strategize over how to maximize the bang for their buck.	A pound of food at Epicurean costs $6.99 at breakfast and $8.99 at lunch and dinner. But each buffet offering comes at its own wholesale price for the restaurant, leading to high variability in profit margin depending on a customer’s selection. Preparation costs enter into the equation, but the restaurant’s business model is premised on the fact that diners will overspend for traditionally cheaper foods.	For example, pork, on average, goes for $3.99 a pound. Eggs cost Epicurean half of that, so a customer who purchased a pound of eggs would bring Epicurean greater profit, though he would pay the same $6.99 as someone who ate a pound of pork for breakfast.	According to a Houston Chronicle report, successful restaurants generally have food costs that are between 25 percent and 38 percent of total revenue. Epicurean’s food costs, however, are at 40 percent.	“We could cut food costs down to 33 percent of revenue if we used lower-quality food,” Epicurean owner Chang Wook Chon said. “We try to provide our customers with high-quality food choices, which is why our customers keep coming back.”	Based on the Chronicle’s measure, Epicurean maximizes its business model when it sells food that costs between $2.25 and $3.42 per pound, though it averages slightly above that cutoff.	After comparing many of the Epicurean buffet options to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics’ food averages, roughly 30 percent of what Epicurean sells is below the 25 percent recommended threshold.	Chicken, strawberries and cheese are among the options that would hurt Epicurean’s profit margins if they were purchased in excess. Grapefruit, turkey and rice are among the restaurant’s safe bets when it comes to profitability.	The restaurant is open 24 hours a day, six days a week, closing late Sunday night and early Monday morning. The buffet closes at 10:30 p.m. every night, while the restaurant’s other options remain open.	In general, food costs in D.C. are 5 percent higher than the national average.	“The cost is way too high. I eat here because it’s more convenient for me because I’m so close,” Lamar Holmes (NHS ’14) said. “At buffets I’ve been to, I can get twice as much for half the price of Epi.”

House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), the third-ranking Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, was interrupted by protestors calling for immigration reform Wednesday evening, the second time a congressman’s speech was interrupted at Georgetown this semester.
Three activists interrupted Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) (SFS ’66, LAW ’69) during his speech, which advocated for immigration reform, in Gaston Hall Oct. 29.
The event with McCarthy on Wednesday was sponsored by the Georgetown University College Republicans.
McCarthy’s speech largely focused on his unorthodox journey through the world of politics and his role in devising the electoral strategy that eventually resulted in the Republican landslide of 2010 in the House of Representatives.
Approximately five minutes into his speech, a group of protestors advocating for reforms to the nation’s immigration system interrupted McCarthy.
“The immigration system tears families apart. Mr. McCarthy, where’s your heart?!” shouted the protestors, who were quickly escorted out by Department of Public Safety officers.
While McCarthy did not acknowledge the protestors at the time, he later talked at length about his views on the immigration reform debate.
“I’m actually a person that supports reforming the immigration system,” McCarthy said. “Our current system for getting into the country, it’s too hard. We have a system today, where 42 percent of everyone that’s here illegally came here legally but overstayed a visa.”
When challenged on the unsustainability of energy sources that come from the burning of fossil fuels, McCarthy emphasized a multi-pronged approach to energy production.
“You’re not going to get to [energy independence] with one energy source. We’re not going to be able to live off of the production of just oil,” McCarthy said.
McCarthy was also critical of President Barack Obama’s role in the October government shutdown. Although McCarthy said that the shutdown hurt the GOP politically in its immediate aftermath, he pointed to lingering problems stemming from the implementation of the Affordable Care Act as a much more perilous issue for Democrats.
“People didn’t like the shutdown, but they’re finding out that they don’t like Obamacare as much either,” McCarthy said.
In another exchange, McCarthy was asked about the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, a Senate bill passed last week that prohibits employers from discriminating against someone on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.
“This is my principle and philosophy,” McCarthy said. “I don’t think anyone should be discriminated against for any reason. … I don’t care what your sexuality is — you shouldn’t be discriminated against. We are becoming so divided as a nation [that] it’s hurting us.”
According to one student, however, McCarthy gave a more direct answer following the event.
“When I asked him if he would support the bill passed by the Senate, he told me flat out, ‘No,'” said Katia Garcia (COL ’17).
The event garnered a wide range of reactions from audience members.
Those supportive of the immigration rights protestors saw the event as simply another politician speaking in broad generalizations, and refusing to give concrete answers.
“It was political garbage, the same thing politicians always say. I thought he could have at least acknowledged the protestors at the time instead of ignoring them. We already feel invisible enough,” Lorena Santiago-Hernandez (SFS ’16) said.
Hoyas for Immigrant Rights President Citlalli Alvarez (COL ’16) compared McCarthy to former Senator Joe McCarthy (R-Wis.) of the Red Scare.
“He talked about staying competitive and reforming the immigration system, but he offered nothing in terms of concrete solutions to the problems,” Alvarez said. “It’s a brand new form of McCarthyism, just a different McCarthy.”
GUCR Chair Alex Cave (COL ’15) said that event was engaging but thought the protestors’ methods were ineffective.
“I didn’t think what they did was productive,” Cave said. “They protested about immigration reform but didn’t even get a chance to hear his response. He went on to speak on the topic at length, but there was no back and forth.”

	Administrators and students discussed dining options and student space at the first Hoya Roundtable of the semester Tuesday evening in Sellinger Lounge.	Chief Operating Officer Christopher Augostini established the Roundtable series two years ago to facilitate student engagement on key campus issues.	Deborah Morey, chief business officer for university services, began the discussion with commentary on the larger theme of student engagement, which has seen a shift this year to more frequent, smaller engagement sessions instead of these larger roundtable forums.	“I’ve been really pleased with how we’ve engaged with students over the past year,” Morey said. “We had a lot of students coming to meetings, and I can’t tell you how important that is with decision-making, and we hope that they will continue to come as the voice of the students.”	Associate Vice President for Auxiliary Services Joelle Wiese led the initial discussion on dining services. She described the success of the Georgetown Dining Food Services Committee.	“Dining is going to be looked at as part of master planning – what the food will look like, in three years, four years, five years,” Wiese said. “We’re going to be looking at top selling items, what are the trends of the industry, from a global perspective and on campuses.”	Wiese cited a group of students’ collaboration with architects to design Hoya Court as evidence of this trend. She further announced that in coming months, Auxiliary Services will begin issuing surveys to garner student input on dining options.	Josetta Moore, the resident district manager for dining on campus, spoke about O’Donovan Hall, inviting head chef Andy Cole to talk about menu changes that have occurred over the past year. According to Cole, the Leo’s staff is seeking to further diversify options for student dining, including adding “sustainable fish Friday,” as well as breakfast sandwiches and international barbeque varieties.	Shifting to student space, Associate Vice President for Community Engagement and Strategic Initiatives Lauralyn Lee addressed the impact of student input in the master planning process including a recent user survey on the Office of Campus Facility Activities website used to reserve study space on campus. She announced the creation of focus groups in coming months to further facilitate student input in administrative decisions.	“We’ll be using it to inform any policy decisions made or how we go about educating people and making better use of the spaces we have,” Lee said.	The roundtable was mostly attended by students in the Georgetown University Student Association. Freshman GUSA Senator Chris Fisk (COL ’17) expressed his appreciation of the roundtable’s ability to enable discussion between students and administrators.	“I think that it’s great that they came and answered questions, and it’s refreshing to see that initiatives are happening that we don’t know about, that they’re actually taking care of things,” Fisk said.	Freshman GUSA Senator Mandy Lee (SFS ’17) agreed, but expressed disappointment over dismal student attendance.	“I definitely wish more students could have come to this, as this is an opportunity to speak directly with administrators that we never get to see,” Lee said.

	The D.C. mayoral race formally went underway Nov. 8, with candidates beginning to circulate petitions to get their names on the ballot. Absent from the pool of nine contenders, however, was incumbent Mayor Vincent Gray.	Candidates thus far include D.C. Councilmembers Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6), Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4), Vincent Orange (D-At Large) (LAW ’88) and Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), former State Department official Reta Jo Lewis and Busboys and Poets restaurant owner Andy Shallal. Three lesser-known, Democratic, candidates – former D.C. councilmember candidate Frank Sewell, perennial mayoral candidate Nester Djonkam and businessman Christian Carter – have filed paperwork to run as well.	The first debate of the mayoral race, sponsored by the D.C. Bar Association, was held Wednesday evening before a live audience at the downtown offices of the Arent Fox law firm, located at 1717 K St. NW.	Candidates must collect at least 2,000 signatures from registered Democrats in the District in order to get their names on the ballot for the Democratic primary in April; there are currently no declared Republican candidates.	Gray’s delayed pursuit of re-election coincides with a pending criminal investigation of allegations of corruption related to his 2010 victory over incumbent Mayor Adrian Fenty in the Democratic primary.	“He has not given a timeline for running,” Gray spokeswoman Doxie McCoy wrote in an email. “When he decides, he will make some sort of announcement.”	The investigation into Gray and other District officials has brought campaign ethics to the forefront of other candidates’ platforms.	During the debate, Wells criticized Gray for what he deemed rampant government corruption.	“We’ve had probably the greatest amount of corruption in our government in the history of home-rule,” Wells told The Hoya. “The way that you lose ground in the city, in any jurisdiction in the world, is if you have a corrupt government.”	Bowser’s campaign expressed a similar sentiment.	“The obvious criticism of this current mayoral administration is on the topic of ethics,” Bowser campaign Chairperson William Lightfoot said. “Muriel is the champion and leader of the ethics reform legislation, which has now created an independent board, and for the first time, councilmembers who have misdeeds are being punished.” Shallal announced his candidacy Tuesday with a speech at Ben’s Chili Bowl. To Shallal, his outsider status and small business experience are seen as assets in his campaign.	“We’ve had four members of our city council either indicted or under possible indictment, and maybe even more,” Shallal told The Hoya. “We’ve had a mayor who’s under a cloud of possible wrongdoing. I think being an outsider is not a bad thing.”	A populist message of unity and inclusion lies at the heart of Shallal’s campaign, and he stressed the importance of creating a singular vision for city government.	“A great city is able to say it’s great for everyone. A great city and a great leadership can bring the voices of the voiceless into the room, and I think those voices are hardly ever heard,” Shallal told The Hoya. “What happens when you uplift people that are not oftentimes heard, and not often visible, it makes all of us better, it makes the entire city better. So it’s not just about helping people on one end, it’s about helping everyone.” Reta Jo Lewis, former White House aide to President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68), officially launched her campaign Nov. 2. Like Shallal, she considers herself an outsider.	“I’m not beholden to anyone except the residents of the District,” Lewis told The Hoya. “The biggest issue as I have traveled around this city is that people are looking for someone who is not part of the status quo. People are not looking for more of the same, they’re looking for someone who has the ability to put the residents first.”	In addition to government corruption, the economy has been a main point of discussion in the early stages of the race.	“Under the current administration, although we see a lot of cranes up and buildings going up, those have been in the pipeline for the last several years,” Lightfoot said. “At the current time, there’s very little that’s directly being planned to develop an economic plan and engine for the city.”	Lewis said that she has the public and private sector experience in regard to the D.C. economy needs.	“I’ve seen the best practices in cities around the country and across the world, and I have the experience and relationships to grow our city and make D.C. a city that works for everyone,” Lewis told The Hoya.	Evans’ platform has also focused on the economy.	“The top message for our campaign is to continue the economic development that the city has seen thus far and to continue to translate that progress to areas that need it the most. By that, we mean to create jobs for people in this city,” Evans’ Campaign Director Jermaine House said.	In the latest campaign finance report, released Oct. 10, Evans, whose ward includes the Georgetown area, emerged as a frontrunner, having collected $768,000 throughout his entire campaign.	“What sets Jack Evans apart is his experience. Jack has been a councilmember for 22 years, and in February, he became the longest-serving D.C. councilmember in the history of the D.C. Council,” House said. “So his experience is far more vast than all of his opponents in the race.” Lightfoot, however, warned that Bowser, who declared her mayoral aspirations in March and was the first candidate to begin collecting petition signatures, has also been raising a large amount of money.	“She’s had a head start,” Lightfoot said. “She’s been walking throughout the entire city and knocking on doors, calling people and asking them to put yard signs up and they’re doing so. … She’s raised more money than any other candidate and she has more money in the bank.”	Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15), president of the Georgetown University College Democrats, said that students want candidates who will directly impact their day-to-day lives. Tezel authored a viewpoint in The Hoya in June urging students not to support Evans, who opposed the university in negotiations over the 2010 Campus Plan.	“I am looking for a candidate that promotes better resources for tenants, particularly for Georgetown students who often have to navigate landlords that might not have Better Business Licenses,” Tezel said. “I’m going to also be looking for a candidate who prioritizes expanded transportation options for Georgetown residents.”	Orange’s campaign could not be reached for comment.

Georgetown University Law Center professor Cornelia “Nina” Pillard’s nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was defeated by a U.S. Senate Republican filibuster Tuesday.
With the Senate’s near party-line vote of 56-41, Pillard was four votes short of the 60 needed to overcome a Republican filibuster. Only two Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), voted in favor of Pillard’s confirmation.
Pillard, a graduate of Yale College and Harvard University Law School, is President Obama’s third nominee to the D.C. Circuit to have been blocked by Republicans this year. She joins Caitlin Halligan, general counsel for the Manhattan district attorney’s office, and Patricia Millett, an Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld partner, in being unable to sway enough GOP senators to cross party lines.
“It’s not about Pillard,” Law Center Dean William Treanor said. “The opposition to giving her a vote is Republican senators who are saying that the D.C. Circuit doesn’t need to have its vacancies filled.”
According to the Court’s official website, those three positions have been vacant since Sept. 25, 2005, Oct. 14, 2011 and Feb. 12, 2013, respectively.
Georgetown University College Republicans Communications Manager Tim Rosenberger (COL ’16) said that he saw this trend as an indication that Obama needed to select more qualified nominees.
“We’re perhaps asking the wrong question, asking why Republicans are blocking the nominations,” Rosenberger said. “We should be asking why there aren’t any acceptable nominees being nominated.”
In particular, Pillard’s pro-choice views and objections to abstinence-only education raised concerns from conservatives.
Moreover, the D.C. Circuit, which currently has eight active circuit judges and three vacancies, is split evenly along party lines with four Republican-appointed and four Democrat-appointed judges. Pillard’s confirmation would skew that balance.
Senate Republicans have argued that, given its caseload, the D.C. Circuit simply has no need for additional justices and that the three vacant spots should be eliminated. Senate Democrats, however, have countered by reminding Republicans that they were not opposed to filling vacancies in the D.C. Circuit during the Bush administration.
“It is deeply disappointing that Republicans are continuing to play political games with all of the president’s nominations,” Georgetown University College Democrats President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said.
Before coming to Georgetown, Pillard worked for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and served as deputy assistant attorney general during the Clinton administration. She has briefed more than 25 Supreme Court cases and has argued nine before the Court.
Treanor stood by Pillard’s qualifications.
“The candidates that the president has nominated should be voted on based on their merits,” Treanor said.
Senate Democrats have criticized the GOP for blocking Obama’s three female nominees to the Court in the last year; the fourth nominee, a male, still awaits a Senate vote. Of the 14 active judges currently serving on the D.C. Circuit, which includes circuit and senior judges, 11 are male.
“You cannot say that one president can have his way on qualified judges and another president can’t have his way – that you can have qualified men but not qualified women,” Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) (LAW ’64) said to Republicans in his final pre-vote floor speech.
Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, countered accusations of sexism during floor speech Tuesday.
“That argument is offensive but predictable. We’ve seen this before,” Grassley said. “When the other side runs out of legitimate arguments, their last line of defense is to accuse Republicans of opposing nominees based on gender or race.”
Despite Tuesday’s vote, members of Hoya Lawyers for Nina Pillard, a group of Georgetown Law students in favor of Pillard’s nomination, remain optimistic.
According to member Bradley Girard (LAW ’14), the group has been in contact with the offices of Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) (SFS ’66, LAW ’69), Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) (LAW ’78) and Leahy in an attempt to bring Pillard’s nomination vote back to the Senate floor.
Girard said that he is hopeful that if the Senate were to have another vote, it would focus on Pillard’s merit, rather than on party politics.
“We know that she is incredibly qualified, that she would be a phenomenal judge and she would apply the law in a fair, even-handed way,” Girard said. “What we want is for there to be a chance for the Senate to vote on that.”

	The university plans to construct a new building to house the McCourt School of Public Policy, but none of Frank McCourt Jr.’s (CAS ’75) $100 million donation can be used for that purpose.	Although no specific plans for a building were laid out when McCourt gave his record-breaking donation in September, Vice President for Advancement Bartley Moore said that the parties involved shared the belief that a new building, likely in downtown Washington, D.C., would be necessary. The school is currently located in Old North, which housed the Georgetown Public Policy Institute until it was incorporated into MSPP.	“[McCourt] and the university share the belief that the fullest vision for the McCourt School will require new facilities that provide ample room to grow,” Moore said. “Though this was not a condition of the founding gift, we share a commitment to put the school near the city center at some point during its first decade.”	All of McCourt’s gift will go toward developing the school through initiatives like student and faculty recruitment and research. The McCourt Fellows Program will help recruit promising students; furthermore, the Massive Data Institute and Center for Politics and Policy are being developed along with an executive education program and a doctorate in philosophy program.	“All of it is going to endow the school, invest in the school’s self-sustainability and … spur future growth,” MSPP Director of Communications Lauren Mullins said.	Plans for a building downtown or elsewhere will be developed over the next 10 years.	“Though we don’t currently have the money to finance the construction of a new building, down the road, we hope that our investment in the improvement and expansion of the MSPP will give us the resources to move into a new location,” Mullins said.	Although university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr could not give specifics about how the building would be funded, she suggested the possibility of a large gift with naming rights, similar to how the Rafik B. Hariri Building was built. Despite the current lack of funds, the university is already beginning to consider locations, Kerr said.	“Old North will remain the McCourt School’s home for the foreseeable future, and the school will continue to function comfortably in that location,” Kerr said. “However, we are currently evaluating location possibilities around the District.”	Moore added that the university was still unclear as to where it could create a new school, though possibilities include the southeast quadrant near Nationals Park and the Anacostia River.	When the university does pursue a building, it will work with master planning partner Forest City Washington and architectural firm Sasaki Associates, which has handled recent construction projects such as the design of the proposed Northeast Triangle Residence Hall.	“In the acreage acquisition process for this new MSPP location, Georgetown is committed to benefitting not only our own community but also Washington, D.C., at large,” Moore said. “Helping develop a parcel of land near the city center would do just that.”

	Patrick Sheehan (CAS ’81) embodied Hoya spirit. As Georgetown’s first costumed mascot, he entertained crowds at basketball games during his four years on campus as a human-sized Jack the Bulldog.	Sheehan, 54, died in a car crash Saturday when the town car he was riding in was hit by an SUV on Hudson River Parkway in the Bronx, N.Y. The car’s driver, Ata Noorzi, 51, also died in the crash.	Sheehan, who was a managing director for public finance at Wells Fargo & Co. in New York, was instrumental in establishing the mascot tradition now visible at every sporting and spirit event. He is remembered as a fun-loving friend who always entertained those around him.	“Pat lights up the room when he walks in,” said Paolo Clemente (GSB ’81), who was friends with Sheehan at Georgetown. “Always a smile on his face, very interested in you. Always makes you feel warm and loved.”	Associate Athletics Director for Operations and Facilities Brian McGuire (CAS ’72) was part of the Alumni Association group that chose Sheehan as mascot during his freshman year in 1977 – a position that replaced the role of the live bulldog, which was absent from campus from 1977 to 1999.	Sheehan stood out at the time because of his clear commitment to staying in the mascot role for four years and his lively personality, McGuire said.	“We put the head on him, we made him do some things … and he was great,” McGuire said. “Without a doubt, he stood above all the others as far as acting like what we wanted the mascot to act like.”	It was quickly clear that McGuire had selected the right student for the position.	“He was the perfect choice, and we just got really lucky with him, because we’d never had a costumed mascot before him,” McGuire said. “And he was perfect at it. We were	really happy all four years.”	Shawn Feeney (GSB ’81), who held a work-study position in McGuire’s office with Sheehan, became close to the mascot pioneer.	“The thing anyone who knew Pat would enjoy is when you had a long bus ride … Pat would have a captive audience and would just have us laughing, in tears, because of his comedic talents,” Feeney said.	Sheehan’s antics during games were full of enthusiasm, and the crowd adored him, both Feeney and McGuire said.	McGuire remembered the Big East tournament two years after the conference’s establishment in 1979 where four alumni posing as mascots infiltrated the Syracuse game and joined Sheehan on the floor of the Carrier Dome, spelling out “Hoyas.”	“Each was a letter. And they cheered every timeout for a whole half until someone finally realized, ‘Hey, Georgetown doesn’t have five different costumed mascots,’ and they finally kicked the rest out, but that was great,” McGuire said.	Feeney described Sheehan’s theatrics on the court, telling the story of a time he and another mascot tussled.	“As a bulldog, you kind of have your moves,” Feeney said, laughing. “We think [Sheehan] raised his hind leg at one point to simulate relieving himself on the husky. … That was one of Pat’s classic moves on other mascots.”	The two mascots were dragged off the court until the athletic director decided the husky had started the fight and allowed Sheehan to return to cheers from the crowd.	Sheehan’s experience at basketball games was before the advent of the Jumbotron, which meant near-constant entertainment was expected from the mascot and cheerleaders during timeouts at McDonough Arena, where the Hoyas played before moving to the Capital Centre in Landover, Md, in 1981. His tenure as mascot also coincided with the early years of John Thompson Jr., who was hired in 1972, five years before Sheehan donned the bulldog suit.	“Nowadays, on TV timeouts, you’ve got these very canned pitches. Let’s find people and have them kiss, or let’s do a trivia contest. Back then, there weren’t those. The TV timeout was a two-minute opportunity for the cheerleaders – but more importantly, the mascots – to just entertain the crowd,” Feeney said. “We didn’t need a Jumbotron at McDonough, because Pat was going to fill the void by just being a character for those timeouts.”	In addition to entertaining McDonough, Sheehan traveled to all away games with the team.	“I tell everybody, even bulldogs now, that Pat Sheehan really set the standard for bulldogs, for mascots,” McGuire said. “He was really good at it. It was natural to him. He had a great personality, and he could emote without speaking. He could relate to all the people.”	“It was like he was born to be the bulldog,” Feeney added.	Sheehan’s excellence in the mascot role for four years set a high precedent for the next in line, who was chosen by a four-person committee.	“They literally went through auditions – big, long auditions – with 50 or 60 kids before we selected them,” McGuire said. That committee eventually chose Lloyd Williams (CAS ’84) as Sheehan’s successor.	Williams tried out for the bulldog role after being encouraged by his friends and seeing ads in The Hoya and the Voice, and he remembered seeing Sheehan around campus when Sheehan was a senior and Williams was a freshman.	“He was the total original,” Williams said. “With his personality, he could have done it without the costume, the crazy, quirky, positive, energetic type of guy he was.”	Sheehan’s legacy followed Williams after he became the mascot.	“People used to come up to me – particularly my first year, but all three years it happened at least once – there’d be a guy who’d come up, look right at me and say, ‘Sheehan was a much better bulldog than you,’ and they were probably right,” Williams said. “He was just a very unique guy, and he really made a great tradition at Georgetown.”	In addition to his success on the court, Sheehan was just as ebullient in his everyday life.	“If you went on a trip with Pat, a car trip, if he found something interesting, like a 50-mile detour to see the world’s largest bowl of twine, that was the kind of thing Pat would do,” Feeney said. “He had this joy of life.”	This adventurous spirit was supplemented by his sentimentality. Sheehan often sent postcards from the various places he visited, always keeping stamps in his wallet in case the opportunity to use them arose.	Feeney said that the large size of a Georgetown class could make it hard for people to have a tangible effect on their class as a whole, but that Sheehan accomplished it.	“What impact can one member of the class have on creating that sense of community?” Feeney asked. “I can tell you, Pat proves to me that one person can make a difference. His impact on my class, the Class of ’81, was profound. We were proud when he was on the court, he created this sense of pride in the university, he made basketball games fun.”	“We’ve had other alumni who’ve died before their prime, but his loss is striking our particular class so much because he was the life of our class,” he added.	After graduating, Sheehan had a 26-year career in the finance industry, starting at Lehman Brothers in 1991. He moved to JPMorgan Chase in 1994 before moving to Citigroup in 2003. Sheehan joined Wells Fargo in June 2010 where he specialized in not-for-profit health care clients.	At the season kickoff basketball game at Verizon Center on Wednesday, there was a moment of silence for both Sheehan and Bill Shapland (CAS ’77), the sports information director who died in April. Sheehan’s funeral took place Thursday in Larchmont, N.Y., for which McGuire sent a mascot costume to the family at their request.	Sheehan is survived by his wife, Rebecca, and three sons, George, 21, Thaddeus, 19, and Nathanial, 15. George is a junior in the College.	Sheehan stayed involved with Georgetown after graduation and took his children to a Hoya basketball game in 2004. At the game, he took a photo with his mascot successor.	“He lived and breathed the Hoya spirit,” Clemente said. “He will be always our bulldog.”

	Members of Club Filipino have mobilized support for a fundraising campaign to support victims of Typhoon Haiyan.	The typhoon, which swept through the Philippines last week, is among the strongest storms in recorded history and left more than 4,000 people dead and 921,000 people displaced, as estimated by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. In total, 11.8 million people were affected by the typhoon.	“Typhoon Haiyan was the largest storm recorded in history, so it’s only necessary that it receives the largest amount of relief in history,” said Bianca Castro (MSB ’15), a member of Club Filipino’s Hoyas for the Philippines fundraising campaign whose family lives in the Filipino capital Manila.	Hoyas for the Philippines, which has approximately 10 active planning members in addition to other volunteers, launched a donation page Tuesday morning on Fundly, an online fundraising platform, which will continue for 60 days. In addition to the campaign’s online presence, students tabled each day this week in Leavey Center to collect donations and spread awareness. The campaign set a fundraising goal of $2,000 and had raised $757 at press time.	“Everyone worked really hard and really quickly to get the website together and reach out to groups,” Club Filipino Secretary Jemm Dela Cruz (SFS ’16) said. “People reached out to us too, so it was really great to hear the support from others. We’re looking forward to working with other entities on how to further get more collections and donations.”	In addition to these fundraising efforts, Hoyas for the Philippines is working on an online campaign video to be posted this weekend.	“One thing that we wanted to do was to highlight members of the Georgetown community for whom this issue is particularly important,” Club Filipino External Liaison Helena Manguerra (NHS ’15), whose family lives on the island of Luzon, said.	Typhoon Haiyan did not affect many students’ families beyond the experience of heavy rains or power outages. The worst damage was in Tacloban, a city 360 miles southeast of Manila.	“My family did lose power the first day or two but things were fine, Internet was fine,” Randy Puno (COL ’16), whose family is from Manila, said. “We had no trouble making sure everyone was OK.”	Students have been able to check in with loved ones in the Philippines.	“I have aunts and uncles whose homes were affected and on my grandma’s house, the roof was blown off, so that’s bad, but we’re just glad everyone’s OK,” Cruz said. “My sister’s boyfriend hasn’t heard from his family yet, so they’re still waiting.”	Some students’ family members have also helped with typhoon relief. Jocelyn Flores’ (COL ’17) grandfather is volunteering for the Red Cross in the Philippines. Although Flores’ family is from Manila and the province of Cagayan, Flores said that she does not know where specifically her grandfather is volunteering.	“It’s extremely difficult because even though they’re establishing Red Cross coordinators there, there’s immense damage,” Flores said. “My grandpa told me that families are being relocated and some are being relocated to areas in Vietnam, just because cities are completely destroyed.”	The Center for Social Justice has joined Club Filipino in mobilizing support for the region through its own online donation platform.	Donations to the CSJ campaign will go to the Disaster Response and Management Team at Ateneo de Manila University, located in the Philippines, as well as the Filipino Society of the Sisters of the Sacred Heart; both have been involved in relief efforts in the region.	Tentatively, donations to Hoyas for The Philippines will go to the Philippines Red Cross.	“We wanted to choose an organization that was Philippine-based and was already on the ground coordinating the effort and was local,” Manguerra said.	In addition to these fundraising efforts, Hoyas for the Philippines is planning a benefit concert for the week after Thanksgiving, which will feature performing arts, music and dance groups and possibly a dance-a-thon. The organization is in the process of choosing a date and the specific groups that will perform.	“We really want to publicize it as the culminating end event of weeks of fundraising and tabling in Leavey, and hopefully we can get a great turnout,” Club Filipino Social Justice Chair Katie Amigo (COL ’15) said. “That way, we can get as many donations and as much help as we can for the typhoon relief.”	Amid the destruction and early efforts at recovery, Puno pointed to the influence of the Philippines’ climate on its people’s character.	“I just really think that the Philippines have what we call the bayanihan spirit. Despite all this calamity and destruction that we experience every year, we also have quite the fighting spirit,” Puno said. “We have that quality within us to stop whatever we’re doing to help each other out when something bad happens, but it’s nice to see that this time, the whole world seems to be pitching in.”

	The D.C. Committee on Education held a public hearing Wednesday morning regarding the Councilmember David Catania’s (I-At Large) (SFS ’90, LAW ’94) D.C. Promise Establishment Act of 2013, which seeks to increase access to a college education for low-income students.	Approximately 45 witnesses and D.C. public school students attended the hearing, as well as representatives from a number of local organizations that expressed support for the bill. Among them was Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce Director Anthony Carnevale.	“Tuition assistance programs for low-income public school students are vital. Increasingly, post-secondary education is the arbiter on success and wealth acquisition in the job market,” Carnevale said. “College is the perfect tool for workforce development. We must try to help as many promising students access this important bill.”	The D.C. Promise Establishment Act would allow eligible students to access up to $20,000 annually or a total of $100,000 over five years of college.	“There is a distinct need for post-secondary education here, but many D.C. families’ finances simply don’t allow for it,” College Success Foundation Co-Founder Bob Craves said. “This [bill] opens so many doors for this city’s youth and betters our District with the infusion of young skilled professionals.”	In particular, Roque Gerald, the director of Washingtonians for Children, an organization that helps children leave the foster care system, described the logistical difficulties that lower income students face during their college education, difficulties that expand past simply tuition costs. For example, students must pay for room, board and food, in addition to other overhead costs.	“Once many lower-income students reach university, they struggle with room and board, food plans and acclimating to their new environment. Unfortunately, not enough resources are made available to them there – the support just stops,” Gerald said. “Once dorms close, we should be looking for a program for low-income students on our tuition-aid program to be able to stay on campus, like foreign students, and we should also have a liaison on many campuses to help them adjust.” KIPP College Support Manager Tamika Harrison echoed this sentiment. According to Harrison, students drop out of college largely due to financial issues, rather than academic or social problems.	“Kids can’t juggle multiple jobs, struggle to eat and still succeed at school – and these are the kids who actually managed to get to college,” Harrison said. “This bill makes sure that our youth can attend the most competitive college that they were accepted to, not just the most affordable option.”	Other attendees shared personal stories and perspectives on the bill. Washington Latin Public Charter School Director of College Counseling Crys Latham described her difficult path toward and through college.	“I’m a first generation college student, and I’ve been homeless at times precisely because a proper support system didn’t exist,” Latham said. “I applaud this committee and this bill for steering funds away from non-profit institutions and for your interest and dedication in this city’s future leaders.”

	“Katie,” a talk show hosted by Katie Couric, filmed a segment in Sellinger Lounge on Wednesday for its five-school national challenge to promote communities partnering with nonprofit organizations to meet their holiday goals.	Georgetown nominated its partner organization, Life Pieces to Masterpieces, which was founded and is run by John Thompson Legacy of a Dream Award recipient Mary Brown. The organization mentors young black men and boys in Washington, D.C., focusing on art projects to increase character development and leadership.	“[This series] takes us across the country to help different organizations leading up to the holidays,” “Katie” special correspondent Cameron Hughes said. “The big thing is to get the community behind the community. It’s getting people to show up organically.”	“Katie” Associate Producer Josh Francis said filming at Georgetown was a positive experience.	“We loved the opportunity to stop at Georgetown. It’s right here in D.C., which makes it central to the community we’re trying to support,” Francis said. “We’ve seen so much support from the student community here. We’re so glad to see students rally to support such a great organization.”	The segment, set to air next Thursday, sought to encourage Georgetown students to donate art supplies and cash gifts in support of Brown’s organization. The Georgetown University Bookstore offered discounted art supplies Wednesday, and donations were collected at the Georgetown basketball game against Wright State Wednesday night at Verizon Center.	“Katie” chose Georgetown largely because of the school’s connection with Brown.	“What we are doing is coming in and using our human development system to help these young men understand who they are and also to understand global citizenship – that they are part of a shared humanity,” Brown said.	D.C. Reads coordinator Mellie Corrigan (COL ’14), who has also led work on Community Service Day and the Martin Luther King Jr. Day of Service, was selected to represent Georgetown and the Center for Social Justice during the segment.	“It was a huge compliment to be asked to represent Georgetown,” Corrigan said. “It was a little bit surreal, being in Sellinger with the camera crew.”	In addition to Corrigan, Associate Vice President for Community Engagement and Strategic Initiatives Lauralyn Lee appeared on the program.	“This was an important opportunity for Georgetown to support our 2013 Legacy of a Dream Award recipient, Mary Brown, and her organization Life Pieces to Masterpieces,” Lee said. “The university recognized Mary as an emerging leader doing impactful work in our city with this award last winter and has been actively partnering with Life Pieces since then. We appreciate the support of so many in our community and across the city for the work at Life Pieces to Masterpieces.”

	A week and a half after Students for Justice in Palestine withdrew from a film screening meant to foster dialogue with pro-Israel student groups, the Jewish and Muslim Chaplaincies held Amplified Voices, a concert aiming to increase dialogue between Palestinians and Israelis through music, in Gaston Hall on Sunday.	Presented as a joint effort by the Jewish Chaplaincy, the Muslim Chaplaincy and the department of government’s master’s program in conflict resolution, the concert attracted Jewish and Arab residents, with approximately 500 attendees.	Not all students involved in last week’s screening through SJP, the Georgetown Israel Alliance or J Street U, a group that advocates for a two-state solution, were involved in the planning of this concert, despite the two events’ similar goals.	J Street U Treasurer Elijah Jatovsky (SFS ’16), however, did marketing for the concert and was also responsible for planning last Wednesday’s screening of “The Other Son,” a French film about a Palestinian and Israeli switched at birth, which saw the withdrawal of official sponsorship from J Street U and the Georgetown Israel Alliance in solidarity with SJP. The screening continued without official sponsorship from any Israeli or Palestinian group.	“[The concert] really was a very important event in that it played to a lot of similar themes and goals … that we believe the movie event was ultimately successful in achieving in terms of kicking off this dialogue,” he said.	He also attributed success to the formats of both events, noting the eschewal of explicit politics, despite the fact that SJP withdrew because of reluctance to appear in opposition to their organization’s national stance, which sees Israelis as oppressors and Palestinians as the oppressed.	The SJP said that treating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict purely through a cultural lens contributed to the normalization of the issue to which they are opposed.	“This kind of an event stresses these two cultures that haven’t been getting along … can come together,” SJP President Albert Doumar (SFS ’15) said. “This is the kind of idea that SJP rejects because of what it implies about the occupation. When you have an event that’s just cultural or mutual understanding, you imply that those sides have long-running grievances against the other side and those need to be solved.”	Peacebuilding Connections, a group that uses art for cross-cultural initiatives, helped plan Sunday’s concert.	“This event is here to bring together people who believe that we need to act collectively in order to solve our problems, and that peace will only come when that is the first desire on both sides,” concert producer Bob Schlehuber said.	The concert’s first act, “Heartbeat,” usually consists of more than 25 artists funded by the Israeli-Palestinian Youth Music Project. Only five of these musicians performed at this particular concert, but they had the audience on its feet for much of the time and sang in English, Hebrew and Arabic.	“I’ve grown up with this barrier wall around my country, Israel. I’ve always been afraid of the people on the other side that would hurt us if there was no wall,” Heartbeat guitarist Guy Gefen said to the audience. “But now I know that our two peoples can truly be brothers, if we wish to.”	Recording artist David Broza played part of his new album via Skype with vocalist Muhammad Mughrabi, a Palestinian rapper and East Jerusalem resident.	Broza, an Israeli, recorded his entire album in the Palestinian sector of the city and collaborated with Palestinian artists on the project, which stresses the need for peace and understanding. Haitian rapper Wyclef Jean will also appear on the album.	Andy Shallal, an Iraqi-American peace advocate who announced his candidacy for mayor of D.C. on Nov. 8, served as the event’s emcee.	“There has to be a place for peaceful dialogue in music and in politics,” Shallal said. “And that place should be front and center, because it is what the silent majority of Palestinians and Israelis really want – peace.”	Jordanian vocalist Faraj Siraj took the stage after Shallal’s speech, singing traditional Arab folk songs in Arabic, English and Spanish.	Director of Jewish Chaplaincy Rabbi Rachel Gartner spoke briefly following Siraj’s performance and cited the Muslim holy text.	“The Quran says that God made [Jews and Muslims] different not so that we will hate one another, but so that we may come to know and see each other in brotherhood,” Gartner said.	Soon after, folksinger and political peace activist Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary took the stage with his guitar to perform with his daughter Bethany, who sang with cellist Rufus Cappadocia.	Students saw these performances as a sign of the concert’s success in promoting its message.	“I think the fact that it interested these famous musicians is all the more testament for the recognition of the need to improve dialogue around campus and the creation of peaceful resolution between these two groups,” Jatovsky said.	After the concert, attendees browsed booths in Healy Hall with information about the performers and other groups involved in advocating for peace through music, including the YMCA Jerusalem Youth Chorus and the Voices of Peace Choir.	“Many people have become cynical as a result of how long the peace process is taking. But hope is free, anyone can have it, and if both sides work together to accept each other and move toward peace, then we can really accomplish something,” Schlehuber said.

	For her efforts empowering Afghan women and children through education, Sakena Yacoobi received the $1 million 2013 Opus Prize Award in Copley Formal Lounge on Wednesday.	“On behalf of the women of Afghanistan and on behalf of the children of Afghanistan, I thank you from the bottom of my heart,” Yacoobi, the founder of the Afghan Institute of Learning, said.	Yacoobi said that she will use the money to organize symposiums that will foster dialogue among young Afghanis.	“With this generosity, I can do things that were my dream,” she said. “My dream was to work with young men and young women in Afghanistan to create an environment where they can come and sit together and have an ideation symposium.”	The annual prize awarded to a faith-based humanitarian initiative is now in its 10th year. The award is funded by the Opus Prize Foundation, which chooses a partner university each year to aid in selection and provide a venue.	“The foundation is excited for Georgetown to host the 10th year of the Opus Prize,” Don Neureuther, spokesperson for the Opus Prize Foundation, said. “The university’s commitment to its Catholic identity, interfaith dialogue, service to others and educating the next generation of global citizens makes it a great partner for this unique and special prize.”	Two other finalists joined Yacoobi in the receipt of prize money. The Fahmina Institute, based in Cirebon, Indonesia, and Sister Carol Keehan, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Catholic Health Association, each received $75,000.	“For the major prize winner, there is a lot that can be done,” said Fr. Daniel Madigan, S.J., who visited the Fahmina Institute after it was announced as a finalist. “For the other finalists, not so much can be done with the money, but being a finalist in this prize gives them some standing in the eyes of other donors.”	The prize is one of the largest humanitarian prizes focused on faith.	“I think the world desperately needs more interfaith efforts and understanding so we do not let people use religion to divide us,” Keehan said.	“The essential goal is to engage and inspire students, those who must carry this work forward,” Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs Assistant Director for Programs Melody Fox Ahmed said. “It is a call to service and an inspiration, a graphic illustration of what can be done in even the most difficult circumstances.”	For the past decade, the Opus Prize has solely been affiliated with Catholic universities.	“The family that created the foundation are deeply committed to the values of Catholic social teaching, and family members have attended many Catholic universities,” Berkley Center Senior Fellow Katherine Marshall said.	The three finalists were on campus for two days, participating in a Student Leadership Breakfast on Tuesday, giving guest lectures in certain classes, like Madigan’s course “Exploring the Quran” and attending the awards ceremony Wednesday.	Keehan expressed her hopes that Georgetown students would join in these faith-based service projects.	“I hope Georgetown students will see the tremendous needs, the suffering of so many that is needless and dehumanizing and their potential to make such a difference,” Keehan said.

	In his spare time, philosophy professor Madison Powers made a website at the end of last year to supplement his teaching on environmental justice. While many such sites might include an assortment of external links and excerpts, Powers’ product offers more than 200,000 original words – the equivalent of about four 200-page books.	Powers, a senior research scholar at the Kennedy Institute of Ethics, created fewresources.org to approach environmental issues from a social justice perspective.	A few months after creating the site for his students in “Global Justice/The Environment,” Powers expanded it to serve as a resource for a population beyond the Georgetown student body, and it now has an international audience clamoring to study this hot topic. He created the acronym FEW, which stands for “food, energy and water.”	While Powers receives no revenue from the site and does little to market it, it regularly receives 6,000 unique visitors a month, with hits coming from 120 different countries. India represents the second-largest group behind the U.S.	“I don’t want anybody’s money,” Powers said. “I want it completely intellectually independent so that no one can raise any suggestion that the point of view in there is a function of someone other’s agenda.”	Powers’ research centers on global justice and public health issues.	“As a philosopher, I’m interested in not just the policy, but I’m interested in every place in that policy discussion where there’s an ethical inflection, where some issue of justice gets raised,” Powers said.	Students in Powers’ class use the site as a resource to supplement their experience in the classroom.	“The website isn’t a textbook, but it kind of takes the place of a textbook because it’s better than a textbook,” Kafele Kossally (COL ’14) said. “It’s basically a repository for basic information about the topic.”	Powers does not, however, see the website as a replacement for the more traditional symposium model traditionally favored by philosophers.	“I would say that it is no substitute for writing books and articles or teaching classes,” Powers said. “It is a way of putting in one place a lot of information that’s of an interdisciplinary nature.”	Although Powers said the website has been successful for spreading his research on the environment and social justice, he does not see the online model as applicable to all fields of philosophy.	“Practical ethics, bioethics and the stuff I do, there’s a good case for this kind of online format that’s different, with the aim of really helping to shape the rising of a certain disciplinary niche within applied ethics,” Powers said. “I don’t think there’d be much need for that in metaphysics or most of the areas of philosophy that are fairly self-contained.”	Students have also found that the website has improved in-class discussion.	“It’s definitely more interactive because the links you choose reflect your interests so even though we pretty much read the same thing every day, everyone brings different information to class, so it makes it more refreshing,” Kossally said.	Powers said he receives 15 to 20 emails a month from visitors to fewresources.org, allowing him to interact with his audience and learn about the environmental issues that are significant in other parts of the globe.	Fifty entries in and with online content double the length of his last book, Powers plans to maintain and grow the site for the foreseeable future.	“I’ve got the copyright and the ownership of the electronic stuff,” Powers said. “I don’t see any reason [to stop]. I’m just getting going.”

	The number of targeted phishing attacks on the university has risen by 60 percent this year, representing the trend of these attacks of moving from government bodies to private institutions.	“The scheme involved phishing attacks that successfully collected NetIDs and passwords,” Chief Information Officer Lisa Davis wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We’ve seen scare tactics in email subjects, including ‘Your NetID has been compromised,’ or a note from ‘Information Technology’ requesting specific information from users.”	University Information Services Security Officer David Smith attributed the continuing success of this tactic to the increasingly realistic quality of these fraudulent emails, including one that appeared to come from Davis’ account.	Davis emailed the Georgetown community Thursday morning requesting that everyone change his or her email account password by the close of business Friday, citing “recent phishing attacks resulting in several identity thefts on campus.” Thursday’s email from Davis used more urgent language than previous phishing warnings.	According to Smith, Georgetown is one of many universities that has been affected by phishing and other cyber security threats.	Tracy Mitrano, director of information technology policy at Cornell University, identified three types of cyber attacks: those originating from common criminals seeking money; “hacktivists,” including vandals and political groups; and most prevalently, advanced persistent threats, or APTs, that are often sanctioned by foreign governments seeking information.	“There is no international Internet governance, and so it is the proverbial wild west in terms of crime and law enforcement global,” Mitrano said.	Foreign sources are interested in universities’ data, according to Mitrano.	“Originally APTs were directed to military information, then industry and, most recently, with focused intensity to higher education,” Mitrano said. “The goal of these attacks is to obtain as much data – for example, from academic libraries and scholarly journals, research and research laboratories and institutional intellectual property – as is possible in the event that it might be useful information to have given any particular academic or industrial development.”	At Georgetown, UIS utilizes an array of techniques to defend against cyber attacks. According to Smith, the constantly evolving nature of cyber threats necessitates a similarly dynamic defense policy.	“Because new attacks are being devised and new vulnerabilities in IT systems are being discovered all the time, UIS creates administrative and technical safeguards to reduce the effects or potential impact of a security threat or vulnerability,” Smith wrote in an email.	Specifically regarding phishing, Davis described how certain safeguards attempt to protect the student body from potential cyber-based threats to personal security.	“UIS’s security analysts stop many phishing attempts through our various proactive means to capture and/or block malicious IPs,” Davis wrote. “We use every technical means at our disposal and are always adapting our tactics as phishing schemes change.”	Phishing, however, according to associate professor of computer science Wenchao Zhou, is particularly difficult to eliminate due to the ease with which someone can send an email from a false address.	“Phishing attacks are sent through emails, and they’re really hard to prevent, because the protocol used to send out emails does not really require authentication,” he said. “Anybody can send out an email from any address they want.”	In addition to employing conventional means of cyber defense, including firewalls and other safeguards of important information, UIS encourages people not to put personal information online and provides phishing avoidance training. In addition, the university has cyber insurance to protect against any potential problems that may arise.	Assistant professor of computer science Adam O’Neill said that the greatest threat to student and university cyber security is a product of human error rather than technical flaws.	“You need to educate people more about these kinds of attacks and show what a strong and weak password is,” he said. “Any large organization with a lot of data is vulnerable to being hacked, as long as people follow the best practices and keep up to date, we have a pretty good understanding about how to prevent this kind of threat.”

	Afghanistan and its population, especially Afghan women, face an uncertain future as the United States and its coalition partners begin drawing down their forces in the coming months.	Today’s symposium in Gaston Hall, presented by Georgetown University Institute for Women, Peace and Security, will include Secretary of State John Kerry, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former first lady Laura Bush as they discuss how far Afghan women have come in the last 10 years. In 2012 both Clinton and Bush were honored by Georgetown’s Center for Child and Human Development and the U.S.-Afghan Women’s Council for their work with women and children. Clinton was awarded the Children Lifetime Achievement Award from CCHD and Bush was awarded the Champion for Afghan Women award from the U.S.-Afghan Women’s council.	“Georgetown was a natural fit to host Advancing Afghan Women: Promoting Peace and Progress in Afghanistan due to our work with the U.S.-Afghan Women’s Council and the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security,” Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh wrote in an email.	“This symposium’s purpose is to raise awareness of the precarious situation faced by the women of Afghanistan as we leave the country,” visiting professor and senior advisor to GIWPS Robert Egnell said.	After the 2001 U.S. invasion and the removal of the Taliban, Afghan women have seen a decade of progress, with women becoming members of Afghan Parliament and assuming top rolls in the Afghan Security and Police Forces. Yet with no post-2014 security agreement decided upon, the gains seen in the last few years are in peril of coming undone.	“In my opinion, they stand to lose ground in virtually every sector which has worked so hard to empower them,” Kimberly Motley, currently the only Western litigator in Kabul, told The Hoya. “Afghan woman are very concerned that as the international forces exit Afghanistan so will their rights.”	Egnell said he believes the symposium represents an integral step to retaining the gains in these rights, because in the past years the United States has shifted its goals in Afghanistan from nation-building to counter-terrorism.	“This conference put these issues on the agenda, on the political landscape,” Egnell said. “It’s a promise to come back to as we draw down in Afghanistan.	While women’s rights have thrived in post-Taliban Afghanistan, the progress has been restricted to urban areas where western influence is tangible, as billions of dollars in foreign aid have been pumped into the cities’ infrastructure.	“There is a dark side to this progress,” Afghan-American Kamran Haris (SFS ’15) said. Born and raised in Virginia, Haris has spent large portions of his life in Kabul.	“Some parts of the country are friendly to women and others are not,” Haris said. “The further south you go, and the closer to Pakistan you get, it quickly turns into the Stone Age.”	Southern Afghanistan has been home to some of the worst fighting of the war and includes Kandahar City, the birthplace of the Taliban, and the Helmand River valley, which irrigates the lucrative and problematic poppy trade.	With the Taliban’s presence still a security issue, Afghan women fear that without adequate protection they will find themselves under the auspices of strict Islamic law once more.	“In recent conversations with Afghan women, particularly young ones, I was struck by how worried many of them are about the post-2014 era,” Washington Post Foreign Correspondent Ernesto Londono said. “I think they see a robust Western presence in Afghanistan as a bit of a shield and worry that without it, ultra-conservative traditions regarding the role of women in society could once again remain the norm.”	While the future remains unclear for Afghanistan and Afghan women, there is little doubt they will need the help of the West to retain their gains.	“It is imperative that the global community remain engaged in helping to ensure that Afghan women continue to gain the momentum that the international community has assisted them in gaining for over a decade,” Motley said.	Kerry, Clinton and Bush are speaking in Gaston Hall at 10 a.m.

A close election and unclear votes in Wednesday’s Student Activities Commission chair election led the group to hold a revote Thursday.
Each of SAC’s 109 affiliated student groups receives one vote in the chair election. According to Georgetown University Student Association Election Commissioner Ethan Chess (COL ’14), who was designated SAC election commissioner for the election, problems included some SAC groups submitting more than one vote for commissioner and ambiguous voting caused by a lack of clarity about which group member was responsible for the organization’s vote. According to Chess, these problems were not present in previous SAC elections.
This was SAC’s second contested election in the four years since it restructured to introduce a campus-wide election system.
“When we collected the votes, we were at times unable to verify who was being voted for, and some clubs inadvertently voted more than their one allotted time,” Chess said. “We have made modifications to the online ballot on HoyaLink, and voting this time around has gone smoothly.”
Voting in the second round ended at 2 a.m. Friday. The results were not available at press time.
The two candidates, one-semester SAC commissioner and Marketing and Public Relations Director Patrick Musgrave (COL ’16) and two-semester SAC commissioner and New Club Development Coordinator Eng Gin Moe (SFS ’16), were separated by a margin of two votes in the initial round.
“We wanted the election to be fair and true in the utmost, which is why we have the recount. We wanted to minimize confusion,” outgoing SAC Chair Jennifer Chiang (SFS ’15) said. “We’ve received great voter turnout from student group leadership, which is great because it shows that they really care.”
Musgrave weighed in on the revote situation and reflected on the campaign as a whole.
“I have complete faith in the election commission and trust that they have resolved the issues that we saw with voting last night,” Musgrave said. “I am happy with my campaign. I would like to thank my supporters, and I commend Eng Gin on a well-fought campaign. I will eagerly await the results, and, win or lose, I intend to keep doing my very best to serve the student organizations of Georgetown.”
For Moe, the close election results revealed a student body heavily invested in the campaign.
“I think both Patrick and I are very competent SAC commissioners and have worked hard to run effective campaigns. The fact that this race was so close speaks to the importance of its outcome to student group life,” said Moe. “While there were issues with the first round of voting, I am confident that the new balloting system will ensure that the voices of all student groups are heard.”
As of 10 p.m. Thursday, nearly 70 percent of clubs had cast votes. Chess hoped that 80 percent of club presidents would eventually vote.
Moe’s platform emphasized communication. Under her leadership, the SAC commissioner would be required to attend one event per club each semester. Musgrave hoped to focus on simplifying the often daunting process required for SAC groups to officially sponsor and reserve public campus spaces for events.

“
	Here is a good trivia question to ask a Major League Baseball fan: How much more money is Stephen Drew guaranteed next year than Mike Trout? Before I give the answer, you should know that Drew is a slightly above-average shortstop with seven years of big league experience. He can help any contender, as he just helped the Boston Red Sox capture their third World Series in 10 years, but he is by no means an essential commodity. Meanwhile, Los Angeles Angels 22-year-old phenom Trout has had arguably the best two-year start to a career the MLB has ever seen. He has put up 21.1 WAR (a stat that measures wins added to a team above a replacement-level player at that position) in his first two years, while Drew has managed 13.4 WAR in his seven years, according to Fangraphs.com.	So, to answer that trivia question, Stephen Drew is guaranteed to earn about $13.6 million more than Trout this year. Drew was granted a qualifying offer by the Red Sox, which is $14.1 million for one season. Teams will submit these qualifying offers so they can receive draft pick compensation if a particular player leaves in free agency. As long as a player has six years of big league experience he can file for free agency and thus be eligible for a qualifying offer. Trout, however, has fewer than three years of big league service time, which means that his team can control his salary. Trout only received $500,000 – $20,000 above the major league minimum – last year, and that was coming off a monstrous 2012. How did this massively underpaid superstar follow that up? Well, by being the best player in the MLB again in 2013, of course. The Los Angeles Angels could theoretically assign him the exact same salary. For the next three offseasons after that, Trout will be able to take the Angels to arbitration in order to determine a supposedly fair value for each upcoming year, but he still would not receive the long-term deal that so many athletes desire and that a superstar like Trout deserves.	I don’t see how this equation works, but it’s not surprising when you consider how the players’ rights are granted in the MLB. Here is another rule that many don’t realize: If a player has played 10 years in the league and five with his current team, he has a de facto full no-trade clause. When reading that, it’s easy to see just how great the benefits are for MLB veterans. After all, a slightly above-average shortstop journeyman can receive $14.1 million as a consolation prize for not finding a long-term deal somewhere else.	As I have written before, the MLB is experiencing a time of ridiculous economic growth. It is so rapid, in fact, that an average player of about 2.0 WAR per year will likely earn around $12 million in a year. If a league is doing so well that an average player can earn $12 million, how are none of those benefits going to a superstar like Trout? Sure, he is young, and tons of young superstars have faded in the past. But if we’re going to follow the free market at all, let’s ask MLB general managers how huge of a contract they’d be able to offer Trout. I’m not saying that there should be no regulations on player salaries, but Trout should be able to earn more than $500,000.	This situation is one of the few ways that the MLB Players’ Association has failed its own. The MLBPA is a union superpower and trumps the unions of all other American professional sports. I’m definitely in favor of sports unions having more power, and the fact that the MLB has had one work stoppage in 20 years while the other three major American sports leagues have combined for six is all the evidence I need. But like so many other unions in the world, the members tend to forget those that are just coming up through the system. I don’t have a problem with MLB veterans getting amazing benefits, but I do take issue with powerful union members not spreading some of the wealth to those who are trying to follow the exact same path to success as they once did, especially when such efforts wouldn’t be very difficult. Because there’s always a chance that Trout or some other young superstar suffers a career-ending injury right before receiving his deserved payday, I don’t see why the MLBPA can’t push to remove two years of team controlled salary. A player would still have his salary determined by the team until he makes the big league, but, for the three offseasons following his debut, he could file for arbitration. After four years of experience instead of six, he could file for free agency. If he’s that good, and if the MLB has that much money, let the market prove it. That’s how I’d fix the situation, and I hope that the players’ union feels the same way in order to care for the next generation.
