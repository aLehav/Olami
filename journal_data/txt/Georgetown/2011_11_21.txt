The Student Activities Commission approved all budgets submitted by the student groups it oversees Saturday, granting about 75 percent of funding requests for the spring semester.
The budgets, which were approved at SAC’s biannual budget summit, were the first to be submitted under the new comprehensive budget system.
About 25 student groups chose to attend Saturday’s meeting to make 10-minute presentations defending and explaining any large or questionable funding requests.
Commissioners then evaluated each budget event by event, reaching a consensus on which events to fund.
According to SAC Chairman-elect Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14), deciding which requests to approve can be a serious challenge for commissioners.
“We obviously want to fund 100 percent of need, but because groups request more than we have available, we have to make cuts,” he said.
SAC’s annual budget is determined by the Georgetown University Student Association, and is supplemented by revenues from the university’s contract with Coca-Cola.
Because the amount of money requested varies among groups, the 25 percent of requests that cannot be met will be cut proportionally across all student organization budgets.
“We want to make sure we are consistent and equitable across all student groups,” Appelbaum said.
During the current semester, SAC approved budgets for 73 groups and was able to provide about 83 percent of requested funding.
President of the College Democrats Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) was satisfied with the attention that SAC has provided to student group funding.
“Georgetown University College Democrats appreciate the effort, thoughtfulness and dedication of SAC to making the allocation process as transparent and equitable as possible,” she wrote in an email. “We’re pleased with the reforms to the funding system that have been made and look forward to a great spring semester of programming.”

The Georgetown University Student Association senate voted unanimously to approve a bill that will redefine several senate districts Sunday.
The bill, proposed by the Senate District Reconciliation Committee, revised the way that the Southwest Quad and two freshmen residence hall districts are designed. It also created two additional off-campus seats, bringing the total to five, and reduced the number of at-large seats from six to four.
Village A Senator Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) noted that the current underrepresentation of off-campus students is unconstitutional.
The three current off-campus senators represent more than 500 students each, which is almost twice the number constituents for every on-campus representative, according to Senate Vice Speaker NateTisa (SFS ’14).
“Our duty is to encourage off-campus participation,” Tisa said. “It is not our right to disenfranchise [students who live off-campus].”
The bill also combined Darnall and Harbin Halls into one district, which will be represented by three senators, and combined the three dorms in the Southwest Quadrangle into one district also represented by three senators. Previously, Darnall, Harbin, Reynolds, McCarthy and Kennedy Halls had been considered independent districts with one representative each.
Some senators expressed concern that the new blocked districts could make campaigning more difficult, but others thought that the larger districts will be a catalyst for deeper senator-constituent engagement.
“The more places you have to campaign for, the more you’ll want to serve more people,” LXR senator Matt Morris (SFS ’14) said. “The senators will have to combat the problem of bettering communication with their constituents.”
The senate also passed the Bill of Rights and Responsibilities resolution drafted by the Student Life Committee, which spells out student rights such as freedom from discrimination and freedom from unreasonable search. The document must be approved by the university’s Disciplinary Review Committee to take effect, according to GUSA members.

Stephanie Bryson (GRD ’13) and Luke Schoenfelder (COL ’12) will be heading to England in fall 2012 as recipients of the Rhodes and Marshall scholarships, respectively.
Bryson, a first year student in the School of Foreign Services’ Master of Arts in German and European Studies program, was one of 32 students chosen to study at Oxford University on the Rhodes scholarship next fall. She will postpone the second year of her master’s program to study in England.
Bryson is the first scholarship winner from California State University, Long Beach, where she was valedictorian of her undergraduate class and graduated summa cum laude. At Georgetown, she is the first recipient of the award since 2008 but shares a legacy with 22 other Rhodes scholars, including President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68).
Bryson said she is interested in studying transatlantic relationships, although she has not determined what degree she will pursue at Oxford. She is still torn between a Masters of Philosophy in European politics and society and a Doctorate of Philosophy in politics and international relations.
“[My interests are] kind of my life story,” she said. “I grew up with both the American and German cultures in my household.”
Much of Bryson’s inspiration to apply for the Rhodes scholarship came from her experiences studying abroad in Germany.
“That’s where it was driven home how important relationships between countries are,” she said. “I see little differences getting in the way of us doing big things.”
Schoenfelder, the 19th Georgetown student to win a Marshall scholarship, was inspired to apply for the grant by his volunteer work in Haiti. Schoenfelder is currently spearheading both alternative energy and sustainable building methods in the country.
Working in an emerging market made Schoenfelder excited about rural energy development and strengthening his business skills.
“After doing all this research in Haiti, I realize that there is so much more I need to learn in order to really be effective,” he said.
A government major, Schoenfelder plans to study either planning, regeneration and growth at Cambridge University or innovation, entrepreneurship and management at Imperial College London. Both programs encompass his interests in environmental protection and job creation.
But Schoenfelder is concerned that studying in England may inhibit his ability to travel to Haiti as often as he would like.
“Being able to … manage operations on the ground from afar is a skill I’m going to have to get better at,” he said.
John Glavin, director of the Office of Fellowships, said that Bryson and Schoenfelder’s applications stood out because they were able to combine academic success with real world experience.
“They are both astonishingly accomplished. They each went out and they forged their own paths,” he said.
Five more students were recognized as finalists for the two awards. Three of the five were finalists for both scholarships, and one additional student was a finalist for the Rhodes alone while one more was a finalist for the Marshall.
Glavin believes that there are several more students at the university who have the potential to win the awards than apply each year.
“I think there are more qualified people at Georgetown than we see in the process,” he said. “I think that more people see a glass ceiling and don’t try.”

Georgetown student Derrik Sweeney (COL ’13) was among three students at the American University in Cairo arrested by Egyptian police Tuesday and accused of participating in violent demonstrations.
The three students have been moved to a prosecutor’s office in the southern part of the city, according to AUC’sDirector of Communications for North America, Morgan Roth. Legal proceedings are expected to move forward Wednesday morning.
The Washington Post reported that the students were accused of throwing Molotov cocktails and clashi
 
ng with police while protesting in Cairo’s Tahrir Square. A video aired on Egypt’s state-run television station showed the three students and their identification cards, including Sweeney’s GoCard.
According to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr,
university officials have been in communication with Sweeney’s family and are also in contact with officials from the American University in Cairo, the U.S. State Department and the U.S. embassy.
“We were in disbelief at first, and now its like we’re trying to figure out what can
we do,” said Joy Sweeney, Derrik’smother.
She said she last spoke to her son around 3 p.m. yesterday and has not been able to contact him since he was detained. According to Sweeney, the State Department has not been able to speak with any of the arrested students either.
“It’s starting to all sink in and really hit home, the gravity of the situation, and I’m just going t
o continue to pray that everything is going to be okay,” she said, adding that it was difficult to watch the video of her son’s arrest.
“It’s pretty scary and pretty sad,” she said. “[Derrik] has a big-time deer-in-the-headlights look. It’s so atypical of him, because he always looks so confident.”
According to the Post, the other Americans arrested were Gregory Porter, a student at Drexel University, and Luke Gates, a student at Indiana University.
Roth said that the university was able to confirm that the students were initially being held in theAbdeen courthouse in Cairo. According to Roth, AUC sent a legal counselor to the courthouse to observe the questioning of the students before the proceedings were moved. The school has also contacted the U.S. embassy in Egypt.
“They have the best resources to be able to locate the students and monitor their whereabouts and their well being,” she said. “You want to be able to confirm with absolute clarity what’s happening and what needs to be done to secure [the students’] safety and their release.”
Stan Carignan, a junior at American University who is studying abroad at AUC, said he saw Sweeney and one of the other students at dinner before they left for Tahrir Square. Protesters have gathered there in recent days to show their opposition to the nation’s transitional government.
“I was shocked when I woke up this morning and heard that they were missing,” Carignan wrote in an email. “They’re all really great kids, so no one expected this to happen.”
The AUC has created an emergency news web page to update students about the events. The university also closed its Tahrir Square campus until further notice, according to an email sent to theAUC community.
“The university cabinet and the emergency management team are meeting daily to monitor the situation as it evolves,” the email said.
According to Carignan, the atmosphere at AUC is tense.
“We literally cannot stop talking about either this or the protests,” he wrote.
The Office of International Programs emailed students studying in Cairo and urged them to stay away from the events in Tahrir Square.
“Georgetown places great emphasis on maintaining the safety and security of all students studying abroad. We would like to remind you of the importance of refraining from participating in any political activities, including demonstrations, while you are studying in Egypt,” the email said.
According to Kerr, the university anticipates continued normal operation of fall semester programs in Egypt.
Gates reported frequently attending the protests on his Twitter account. In a tweet posted Nov. 19, Gates wrote that protesters had been fired upon with live bullets.
“Yes live bullets we have the shells, i was here!!” he wrote. He later posted, “It’s only scary cuz I feel so reckless.”
All three students were to return home at the end of the semester.
Joy Sweeney said she has been told by the State Department that the students are likely to appear in court tomorrow.
“We’re all in constant communication. We’re all talking back and forth and hoping to bring him home safe,” she said.

First-year Georgetown Law Center student Tommy Tobin (L ’14) has been named one of this year’s 12 George J. Mitchell Scholarship recipients.
Tobin will be using the award, which funds one year of graduate study at an Irish university, to attend University College Cork during the 2012-2013 academic year. He plans to continue his studies at Georgetown after returning from Ireland.
Tobin, who has a passion for addressing the global problem of hunger, chose a program in County Cork because of opportunities in the area. He said he is excited to become involved with Ireland and the European Unions’ efforts to reduce food waste, and meet with leaders who he described as real power players in the community.
“At University College Cork I will take a range of courses [on the use of] law to make institutions work for the individuals they are supposed to,” Tobin said.
Tobin draw from the areas of law, economics and psychology in his studies at University College Cork.
Tobin first became passionate about food sustainability through previous service work as young adult. Tobin turned to volunteering as a means to engagement after a speech impediment discouraged him from public speaking.
The scholarship, granted by the U.S.-Ireland Alliance, honors former U.S. Senator George J. Mitchell (GRAD ’61), a Georgetown Law Center alum who played an integral role in the Northern Ireland peace process.
Tobin was chosen from more than 300 applicants nationwide.
“The Mitchell Scholarship is a great opportunity to … learn and grow with a great community of scholars in Ireland,” he said.
Tobin graduated from Stanford University in 2010, where he double majored in international relations and history. He is the founder and president of Project FeedBack, a nascent national food recovery program that aims to connect food donors with recipients.
Tobin was named a finalist for the President William Jefferson Clinton Hunger Leadership Award in 2009, a STOP Hunger regional honoree by the Sodexo Foundation in 2010 and a semi-finalist for the 2011 Echoing Green Fellowship for Social Entrepreneurship for his work to fight hunger.
