Around 40 Georgetown students lay on the ground across Red Square on Monday afternoon to raise awareness about 43 students in Mexico who have been missing since clashes with the police Sept. 26.
“We wanted to break the silence that has come to characterize U.S. response to violence in Mexico,” Citlalli Álvarez (COL ’15), who helped to organize the demonstration, wrote in an email. “We cannot ignore our neighbor to the south. Our destinies are tied, and we cannot continue to conveniently choose when ‘Mexican problems’ concern us.”
According to the BBC, the 43 students, who were from a teacher’s college, went missing in Guerrero, a state in southern Mexico, calling attention to the fact that local police in Mexico are often linked to organized crime. The students had travelled to the nearby town of Iguala to protest against discrimination in the hiring process for teachers. Local police opened fire on the buses of students, who have not yet been found.
Protests in Mexico have called for the return of the missing students. There have also been other protests in the United States, including one at the University of California, Berkeley on Monday. Other protests took more conventional forms than a lay-in.
According to Chris Wager (COL ’17), the lay-in was a symbolic gesture to indicate the importance of pressuring the Mexican and U.S. governments to take action to find the students.
“It was calling for not only the Mexican government to address violence but also for our government in the United States to take a more active approach to dealing with Mexico,” Wager said. “In large part, we’re not really hearing much about what’s going on in Mexico right now. Part of our agenda was to break that silence that’s currently dominating in the United States.”
The lay-in lasted from around12:30 to 1 p.m., when Red Square is host to heavy foot traffic.
“We were there right when people got out of classes so there was a good bit of traffic and everyone going through Red Square at that time had to figure out a way around us,” Wager said. “That called attention to the lay-in and it called attention to the solidarity with the Mexican students,” Wager said.
Ben Cavat (COL ’17) was in Red Square on Monday afternoon and saw the lay-in.
“It worked pretty well,” Cavat wrote in an email. “It would’ve been more successful had there been more people in Red Square but everybody passing by got to see them.”
Students handed out informational fliers to people passing by.
Students began to plan the demonstration late last week. Although it was not organized by a specific student organization, it attracted members of Movimiento Estudiantil Chican@ de Atzlán, the Georgetown University Mexican Student Association, Hoyas for Immigrant Rights, the Georgetown University Solidarity Committee and the Georgetown chapter of the NAACP.
In addition to raising awareness about the missing students, event organizers wanted to draw attention to issues such as migrant rights and police brutality.
“We just wanted to bring attention to the fact that this kind of police brutality is something in Ferguson and in Guerrero in Mexico and all over,” Wager said. “It’s not acceptable, by our standards, and we’re trying to call attention to that.”
Diana Escalante (COL ’16) participated in the lay-in and said that she felt that it made the events in Mexico more accessible to Georgetown students.
“I think for a lot of people here at Georgetown it is easy to be detached from the violence that occurs outside of our country, but it’s events like these that make tragedies abroad more palpable to our student population,” Escalante said.
Wager said that he thought the lay-in was a success.
“I think the group was pretty happy with the lay-in … in terms of raising awareness and breaking the silence on the issue,” Wager said.
Additionally, the lay-in served as a precursor for a larger protest that will take place at the Mexican Consulate this afternoon. Georgetown students were approached by Washington, D.C. community members who organized today’s protest.
“We were trying to raise awareness about another action … at the Meixcan Consulate to really push the Mexican government to address these issues,” Wager said. “All of that was kind of conveyed through what we were doing up there [in Red Square].”

Students have expressed concerns about poor lighting and overcrowding in the detour replacing the pathway in front of Reiss, which closed Oct. 13 due to construction of the Northeast Triangle Residence Hall.
Pedestrians must use an indirect pathway west of the Reiss Science Building until the central pathway, which connects Red Square to Henle Village, Darnall Hall and the Leavey Bridge in the north of campus, reopens after the construction project is completed in summer 2016.
The indirect pathway includes twists and turns that prevent those traversing it from seeing who is walking both in front of and behind them, and it is poorly lit at night, students said.
“We need more lighting [in the detour]. Normally on the weekends I will walk home alone, but on Saturday [night] I was at Village B and I wouldn’t walk home alone,” said Emily DeMaio (NHS ’17), who lives in Henle Village, which can only be reached by the makeshift route when coming from the front of campus.
DeMaio also said that she was concerned about the mesh linings that are on the fences in the construction site.
“Some of the fences have that mesh so that we don’t have to see the construction, but I’d really prefer it to be see-through,” DeMaio said. “Before the Reiss walkway was closed, and I was walking through there, there were construction workers and it scared me because I heard voices from behind the fence and then someone came out and I jumped, because it was five in the morning and I was alone.”
Kathleen Reilly (SFS ’17), a Henle resident, said that she is also concerned about walking through the detour at night.
“I think the section of the path between the Intercultural Center arch and the front of Reiss is the most poorly lit and also the most remote [place on campus],” Reilly wrote in an email. “I am always especially aware while walking in that section.”
Reilly said that although some of the sidewalks in the Georgetown neighborhood have the same level of lighting at night, poor lighting on campus is of particular concern.
“I’m more likely to be walking by myself, back from a nighttime meeting or whatever, on campus than in the neighborhood,” Reilly said.
Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey said that construction workers will add lights to the pathway by the end of the week, making it easier for students to safely navigate to the pathway at night.
Although the closure of the pathway has created safety concerns, Morey said that the path was blocked off in order to protect students from different safety concerns during construction.
“We tried to keep that pathway open but with the overhead construction in the construction site, we had to close it for construction logistics and student safety,” Morey said.
Construction plans for Northeast Triangle also include alterations to the pathway, widening it to the east of Reiss and making it more wheelchair accessible. Morey said that his office has not heard many complaints about the construction from students.
“Most students are understanding that this will improve the community and the campus in the long run and that this is just a short-term inconvenience,” Morey said.
Morey expressed that Georgetown’s ultimate goal in these developments is to increase pedestrian traffic and student presence on the north side of campus.
“We are trying to improve the nature of pedestrians on campus because I don’t think Georgetown is the most pedestrian-friendly campus,” Morey said. “We have gotten complaints that there is less of an overall student body population on the north side of campus where Henle Village and Darnall Hall are. The construction will add more people and more vibrancy to that side of campus.”
Darnall Hall resident Mia Lopez-Zubiri (COL ’18) said that in an effort to establish an inclusive environment for future residents of Darnall and Henle, the construction has further segregated current residents of those buildings, and off-campus residents of Burleith, from the rest of campus.
“The construction is inconvenient because it cuts off our main route to the center of the school,” Lopez-Zubiri said. “It is difficult to get to the center of the school because we have to take a longer route. We’re completely cut off from the rest of the school so it has isolated Darnall even more than it already was.”

The Palisades Citizens Association is conducting an investigation into restoring the Foundry Branch Bridge located to the west of the university, which would connect the Georgetown neighborhood to the Palisades neighborhood and potentially extend a trail to Glen Echo Park in Maryland.
The District of Columbia Department of Transportation proposed the restoration as part of “Move D.C.,” its 25-year plan for transportation projects.
From 1896 to 1960, the Foundry Branch Bridge was the largest of the four bridges along the Glen Echo trolley line that ran through Georgetown. The bridge was put out of use after the closing of the trolley line, but the now-deserted structure is still owned by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. Trails Committee Chair of the Palisades Citizens Association Brett Young explained that repairing the bridge could fuel the restoration of a 3.1-mile trail that runs from Galena Place in the Palisades to the corner of 37th Street and Prospect Street NW.
“I think, frankly, it’s a no brainer,” Young said. “The idea of the whole city, the area we live in, is about connectivity.”
The Palisades is the neighborhood located directly to the west of Georgetown, running from Foxhall Road at the edge of the university to the D.C.-Maryland border.
Young commended the bridge restoration for giving students a convenient option to travel off-campus.
“If done properly, it could be a quick and convenient way for students and members of the Palisades community to get where they need to get to,” Young said.
Young has been one of the leading advocates for the proposed project since he moved to the Palisades four years ago. He noted that the next step for the project is to find an agency to fund the restoration.
Greg Miller (SFS ’14), an office manager at the School of Foreign Service dean’s office who co-leads an unofficial bicycling working group, said that though local trails such as the Capital Crescent trail and C&O Canal path, already exist, this project would positively affect the university.
“It would provide an additional connection to the university and local neighborhoods, allowing people both within the university and the neighborhoods to have access to another high quality multiuse trail for recreation and commuting,” Miller said.
To gauge community support for the restoration of the Foundry Branch Bridge and the entire right of way, the Palisades Citizens Association released a survey earlier this week. The survey, open to all residents, including Georgetown students, asks participants to describe their current uses for the right of way and give feedback for how the project could improve the existing bits of the trail.
Since the restoration project is still in its early phases, budget and timeline has not yet been determined.
If the Foundry Branch Bridge is restored and such a trail opens up, Georgetown students would have access to new routes for running and biking.
Alyssa Kasher (COL ’15), captain of Club Triathlon, said she is unsure whether or not the team would use a new trail since they usually bike along MacArthur Boulevard, which runs parallel to the proposed route. She added that a new trail would be an exciting possibility all the same.
“It would be pretty cool to have access to a trail that starts right on campus,” Kasher said.

Just want to let everyone know that the link to the  Palisades Citizens association survey is at https://dctrailsurvey.org/
Please be honest on where you live and in the comments section include that you are a student at GU.
Your comments on this bridge would be enormously helpful.

This would be a safe and short route for students and staff walking from Foxhall Village and Palisades to class/work.  Also, cyclists can connect easily to stores & services on MacArthur Blvd. and Bethesda.

The International Spy Museum abandoned a planned relocation to the Carnegie Library in Mount Vernon Square after the Washington, D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board declined to approve renovations on the historic building Oct. 7.
The museum dedicated to the history of espionage is looking to move out of its current location on F Street NW in Gallery Place in order to accommodate larger exhibits and other expansions. The lease at the Spy Museum’s current location expires in September 2017.
“We thought the historic Carnegie Library would be a great space, and complementary to our already existing programming,” EventsDC Vice President of Communications and Marketing Chinyere Hubbard said.
Convention center authority EventsDC joined the museum in proposing the move last September, seeking to renovate the Historical Society’s galleries and offices and to add 58,000 square feet of space to the library, as well as a new visitor center.
“We were both focused on activating and revitalizing the library, and also the Mt. Vernon Square itself,” Hubbard said. “We were both committed financially and programmatically to do so.”
EventsDC looked to create a deal with the Historical Society of Washington that would enable the museum to have a permanent home at the library and also allow the convention center authority to use the site for other events. However, the lack of significant renovation of the Carnegie Library since its opening in 1903, combined with its historical significance, posed obstacles to the proposal
“The Historic Preservation Review Board understood the problems of trying to animate the building and the square,” Deputy Preservation Officer Steve Callcot said. “It needed to be done in a way that retained the park-like feel of the square, and didn’t adversely affect the building itself.”
The museum’s main exhibits were to be housed underground, with large pavilions built to accommodate other events and displays.
Despite numerous meetings with the museum to agree upon a solution, the Historic Preservation Review Board did not approve these proposed constructions as a result of opposition from the community around the library, who felt the expansion would be an unnecessary infringement on the space, forcing the museum to abandon its plans to relocate to the site.
“[The community thought that] it would be an infringement on that historic site and that it would impede site lines throughout the city,” International Spy Museum Public Relations Manager Jason Werden said. “The board was certainly in a tough spot trying to help us meet our needs, while also trying to serve the needs of the community. … We reached a point in the process where we couldn’t move it forward any more without sacrificing the content we needed.”
The International Spy Museum has attempted to relocate for over two years due to problems related to space. At 20,000 square feet, the museum’s lack of adequate space has limited the amount of material that can be on display, as temporary exhibits often demands that the museum sacrifice or rearrange permanent collections.
“We knew that in order for the success of the museum moving forward, we needed more space for our exhibitions and temporary exhibits,” Werden said. “We’ve really reached the brim of square footage.”
Despite these setbacks, EventsDC and the museum will continue their partnership going forward.
“We remain committed to working with Spy, to help them find a permanent home for the museum within the city,” Hubbard said. “What we don’t want is for the city to lose this highly important and influential spy museum as a result of this unfortunate development.”
The museum does not have any immediate plans for moving into another location, but is committed to planning the future layout of any possible new home.
“We will continue our plans of redeveloping our content,” Werden said. “Our curators, historians and exhibition staff are continually in the process of mapping out what the museum will look like when we eventually move.”

President Barack Obama appointed Georgetown University adjunct professor Ron Klain (CAS ’83) to head the United States’ response to the Ebola outbreak Friday, affecting his role on campus this semester.
“When the president called, giving up this class was one of the top things on my mind,” Klain said to his class, “Presidential Debates,” Monday night, according to students in the department of government seminar.
Klain has taught this course on and off since spring 2012. According to students in the seminar, the future of this semester’s class remains undecided.
“Professor Klain is working it out with the government department now. It’s not totally conclusive what he’s going to be doing, but he is still going to be involved with the class in some form,” Alexandra De Luca (COL ’15), a student in the class, said.
Possibilities include the placement of a substitute professor for the remainder of the semester, but Klain assured the students that they would receive credit for the course.
“He specifically says that the fact that he’s going to go off and have this opportunity doesn’t mean that we won’t be able to graduate, because we will be able to keep the class and the class will still count,” De Luca said.
As Ebola czar, Klain will coordinate the federal response to any outbreak in the United States. He will report to White House Homeland Security Adviser Lisa Monaco and National Security Adviser Susan Rice, according to CNN.
“It makes sense for us to have one person … so that after this initial surge of activity, we can have a more regular process just to make sure that we’re crossing all the T’s and dotting all the I’s going forward,” Obama said to CNN.
Klain graduated Georgetown summa cum laude with a degree in Government before receiving his juris doctor magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, where he served as editor of the Harvard Law Review. He is a former chief of staff to Vice Presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore and served as an adviser to both President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68) and Obama. He is currently president of Case Holdings and general counsel at Revolution, an investment group launched by AOL co-founder Steve Case.
Michael Stoto, a professor of health systems administration and population health in the School of Nursing and Health Studies at Georgetown and a senior scholar in residence at AcademyHealth, a nonpartisan health research and policy group, said that Obama’s decision to appoint someone with political experience, rather than a science background, would bring in a variety of perspectives.
“I think what it does add is the ability to manage things. I think we have terrifically capable scientists and public health people at [the Center for Disease Control and National Institutes of Health] and lots of other organizations,” Stoto said. “But whenever you have a lot of organizations that have different perspectives you have the question of, how do you get them all to work together? So the idea of having a so-called czar to manage their interactions can be a very useful thing.”
Stoto said that Klain, unaffiliated with any medical or scientific agency, would be better able to objectively make decisions, rather than imposing his own opinions.
“His job is to manage the process rather than to give his view about what should be done. And I think that’s an appropriate thing when you have such a complicated system and a need for a very timely response,” Stoto said.
De Luca praised Klain as one of the best professors she has had at Georgetown, notably for his unique experience in his field.
“He knows all these people and is able to bring in great speakers,” she said. “I mean, you can’t really get much more than that.”
She also complimented Klain for the attention and interest he puts into his students. She recounted a time when she ran into him at Wisemiller’s on the second day of class, and he greeted her by name.
“I don’t think any professor I’ve ever had, especially one with such a high-profile job, and he’s an adjunct — I’ve never had a professor get to know my name on the second day of class. I don’t know — it was really impressive,” she said.
At the end of class, his students applauded and shook his hand as they filed out of the classroom.
According to his students, Klain told his class that his position as Ebola czar will end in February.
During his time as an undergraduate at Georgetown, Klain served on the Board of Editors of The Hoya. In November 2013, Klain hosted an event on ethics in politics with actor Kevin Spacey.

Data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this month revealed that 1.1 million people in the United States are currently living with HIV, with the number of new infections remaining steady at approximately 50,000 infections per year since the mid-1990s. D.C. still suffers from the highest HIV/AIDS rates in the country, according to the latest data from the D.C. Department of Health.
“Big picture, we know that there’s approximately 50,000 new HIV infections annually and currently 1.1 million people living with HIV. However, we also know that certain communities are disproportionately affected (e.g., gay and bisexual men, African Americans, Latinos, etc.),” CDC spokesperson Donnica Smalls wrote in an email to The Hoya.
According to the CDC data, HIV is primarily still an urban disease. Over 600,000 people have died from AIDS since the epidemic started, and 15,000 people die of AIDS in the U.S. each year. Of the more than one million Americans with HIV, only 25 percent successful keep their virus under control.
Additionally, the CDC reported that the 63 percent of HIV infections are transmitted through male-to-male sex. The CDC estimated that MSM accounted for 78 percent of new infections in men and almost two-thirds of all new infections in 2010.
The latest D.C. DOH data available, from 2012, says that 2.5 percent of the D.C. population is living with HIV. Gay and bisexual men of all races have consistently had the highest rates of infection nationally.
White House AIDS Coordinator Jeffrey Crowley, a senior scholar at the Georgetown University Law Center’s O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law, said that the District, which has the highest HIV/AIDS diagnosis rate in the country, needs to balance the needs of this particular population with other populations disproportionately affected by the disease.
“In the District of Columbia, gay men are highly impacted, but black women and people who inject drugs are also highly impacted,” Crowley said. “A challenge for policy makers and the public is to appropriately place high infection rates among gay men in context, and to appropriately target resources for gay men and other populations while demonstrating a strong commitment to all highly impacted communities. Nonetheless, gay men are very disproportionately impacted by HIV in D.C.”
Melody Wilkinson, an instructor of nursing in the department of nursing at the School of Nursing and Health Studies and certified HIV specialist with the American Academic of HIV Physicians, concurred, noting that the racial breakdown of those affected by the disease has changed. According to data released by the CDC this month, African-Americans make up 14 percent of the population nationwide, but 44 percent of HIV infections.
“HIV disease has always disproportionally impacted [gay] men,” Wilkinson said. “Unlike the early days of the epidemic when HIV disproportionately impacted gay white men, we have seen a shift, and now African American [gay] men represent more than any other subgroup of gay/bisexual men. …African Americans bear a heavy burden related to HIV.”
Latinos have also faced disproportionate HIV rates. At 17 percent of the national population, Latinos make up 21 percent of new HIV infection, according to the recent CDC data.
The World Health Organization classifies a severe epidemic as a disease affecting more than 1 percent of the population. The rates for whites, Hispanics and blacks all exceed this classification, with 1.2 percent of whites, 1.6 percent of Hispanics and 3.9 percent of blacks affected by the disease in D.C. in 2012.
In all wards except Ward 3, more than 1 percent of adult residents are living with HIV. Ward 8 has the highest percentage of HIV-infected people. Wilkinson related the prevalence of the disease to poverty throughout the wards.
“I believe that the two greatest barriers to improved HIV care are related poverty and stigma,” Wilkinson said. “Poor patients may have fewer health care resources.
They may not see a primary care provider for health screening and they may wait until they’re sicker before seeing a health care provider.”
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, D.C. residents ranked HIV/AIDS as the top health issue facing the area, whereas nationally it is ranked seventh. Crowley noted that increased focus on the disease has improved the District’s response to the disease.
“It is important to acknowledge that D.C. has made major strides in recent years in strengthening its response to HIV,” he said. “In fact, some of the most innovative and evidence-based approaches to preventing and treating HIV are being tested in D.C.”
Wilkinson urged, however, for more accessible testing to prevent the spread of the disease, which still kills more than 15,000 people per year in the United States.
“A change in practice — with more routine HIV testing — would identify those who are HIV-positive and enable those patients to engage in care and decrease the spread of HIV,” Wilkinson said. “In addition to improving testing efforts, we must do a better job linking patients to care, engaging them in care and medically managing those patients.”

The government department established a new democracy and governance B.A./M.A. program, allowing undergraduate students to graduate in five years with both a bachelor’s and master’s degree in a specific subject.
The B.A./M.A. program is multidisciplinary and engages with the fields of political science, international relations, security studies and development studies.
“Democracy promotion has been a key component of U.S. foreign policy for decades,” Associate Director of the democracy and governance program Yonathan Morse said. “Our two-year M.A. is the most comprehensive of its kind in the U.S. and is meant to address these needs by educating students about the foundations of responsive and democratic government, the relationship between economic and political reform and the design and role of policy.”
The stand-alone M.A. in democracy and governance currently has an average incoming class size of 12 students.
The government department also offers a B.A./M.A. program in American studies.
The B.A./M.A. program will incorporate all of the existing requirements for the M.A. program, but will both cost less and take less time, according to Justin Harried, the administrative officer for the democracy and governance program. Undergraduates who apply to the program will begin taking graduate courses in the second semester of their senior year and transition into graduate school the following academic year.
The program is intended for top students within the government department and is already in effect.
“The only difference between the B.A./M.A. and the M.A. in democracy and governance is that by allowing the B.A./M.A. students to take M.A. level courses in their senior year they are saving themselves a significant amount of time and money as opposed to enrolling in the M.A. after graduating,” Harried said.
Students must complete 120 credits for the bachelor’s degree, as well as 42 credits for the M.A. in democracy and governance.
Morse said that one of the goals of the new program is to allow students to enter the work force in less time.
“I think that students are looking for these sort of options, especially as graduate education is a growing requirement for certain professional fields,” Morse said. “We are also very aware at how valuable a person’s time is and how the financial side of education is a real concern for many students.”
The new program also places a high value on practical experience and offers up to six credits for internships.
“We really stress theory and practice, and provide opportunities for students to engage with the professional world while they are in school,” Morse said. “Since the M.A. is part of the government department, students have access to a world class faculty. But, the M.A. program also hires active practitioners who teach students.”
Eddie Morles (COL ’17), who is majoring in government, said that he is considering the program since it lessens the financial burden takes less time.
“I am planning on focusing on domestic public policy, and this program would be great, especially since it saves both time and money for the same M.A. degree,” Morles said. “The time and financial commitment was always a hindrance for me when I considered an M.A., so it is wonderful that these obstacles are cleared in this program.”

Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden (COL ’92) was discharged from the U.S. Navy Reserve after testing positive for cocaine in a random drug test conducted last summer.
Biden co-taught a 500-level course in Georgetown’s Master of Science in Foreign Service program called “The Art of Advocacy: Inside and Outside of Government” as an adjunct professor alongside Robert Norton in the spring semesters of 2012 and 2013. The course is still listed on the Georgetown University website’s course offerings list for spring 2014-2015, but according to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, Biden and Norton told the university several weeks ago that they did not have enough time in their schedules to teach this school year.
Georgetown University’s Drug-Free Workplace policy states that all Georgetown employees must be drug-free at the workplace.
“The University will discipline individuals convicted of possession with intent to use an illegal and/or controlled drug in the workplace within 30 days of receiving notice of the employee’s conviction. Disciplinary actions may include the termination of employment — lesser sanctions may require the employee to satisfactorily participate in an approved druge [sic] abuse assistance or rehabilitation program,” the policy states.
Biden, 44, earned his B.A. from Georgetown University and his J.D. from Yale University. He practices as a lawyer at a New York-based law firm and is currently a managing partner at the investment firm Rosement Seneca Partners. According to Navy spokesperson Cmdr. Ryan Perry, who spoke to NPR, Biden joined the U.S. Navy Reserve as a public affairs officer in 2012. Biden joined the Navy Public Supports Element East in Norfolk, Va., in May 2013, and he was discharged in February 2014.
“It was the honor of my life to serve in the U.S. Navy, and I deeply regret and am embarrassed that my actions led to my administrative discharge. I respect the Navy’s decision. With the love and support of my family, I’m moving forward,” Biden said in a statement released by his attorney following his dismissal.
The Vice President’s office did not comment on the incident.

An unidentified male gained entry into a residence and sexually assaulted a female on the 3300 block of Prospect Street NW on Sunday at approximately 6:30 a.m.
The Metropolitan Police Department issued a press release Oct. 20 describing the suspect as a 5-foot 7-inch Hispanic male in his 20s. The suspect was clean-shaven and last seen wearing a leather jacket.
The Georgetown University Police Department issued a public safety alert notifying the university community about the incident, urging students living off campus not to prop doors open and keep doors and windows locked.
“MPD is taken the lead in this investigation and GUPD is supporting their investigation,” Chief of Police Jay Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The incident occurred shortly after two other sexual assault incidents in the District early Sunday morning. Around 3:30 a.m., a man attempted to assault a woman on I Street NW near The George Washington University and the Foggy Bottom Metro stop. The Washington Post reported that MPD arrested 46-year-old Mustapha Kone as a suspect in the incident. Around 3:45 a.m., a woman was assaulted in a car near Dupont Circle. Police are looking for a silver-colored sedan and a man with dreadlocks last seen wearing khaki pants.
MPD urges anyone with information about any of the events to call the police at 202-727-9099 or text the tip line at 50411.

The LGBTQ Resource Center is holding its third year of OUTober programming in honor of LGBTQ History Month with the help of $1,500 in funding from the Office of the President.
“OUTober is really a collaborative process between the LGBTQ Resource Center and GU Pride trying to populate a calendar and then we reach out to common and uncommon partners that we’ve done OUTobers with in years past,” GU Pride President Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) said.
The programming, which began Oct. 1 and will continue until Nov. 20, includes a total of 16 events.
Lloyd said that the money from the Office of the President was helpful but made up less than a third of the overall budget. The funding was used to purchase GU Pride’s annual “I Am” t-shirts.
“Part of [OUTober] is the Center and Pride identifying what issues and what speakers we want to bring, part of it is tradition, like the ‘I Am’ shirts and coming out in Red Square, and then the last part is trying to see what conversations other campus partners want to have,” Lloyd said.
This year, OUTober programming aims to emphasize the connection between sexuality and other social issues.
“Much like OUTobers of years past they focus on service and intersectionality within the LGBTQ community,” Lloyd said.
The programming commenced with a poetry reading by Raquel Gutierrez, a writer and co-founder of a performance group aimed at creating conversations around the intersection of LGBTQ and Latino issues in Los Angeles.
GU Pride Media Manager and Historian Campbell James (SFS ’17) went to see Gutiérrez speak.
“She read an essay about her experience as a college-aged adult in a specifically lesbian community of color and a poor community of color in southern California,” Campbell said.“I just thought it was interesting to hear a lot of her experience and to learn a lot more about the different parts of a LGBTQ community.”
LGBTQ Resource Center Assistant Director Julian Haas said that the speakers will help to facilitate a conversation about the intersectionality of sexuality and other issues.
“One of the biggest speakers we’re bringing this year is Bettina Love,” Haas said. “Dr. Love does a lot of work around intersectionality and intersectional work with youth of color from low income areas. That intersectional approach is really reflected in all the events that we have.”
Love, an assistant professor of educational theory at the University of Georgia, is an award winning author whose research focuses on the way that hip-hop music and culture influence the social and political identities of urban youth.
According to Haas, the events aim to engage with attendees.
“What’s nice is our academic events aren’t lectures; they’re workshops,” Haas said.
Haas said that OUTober was intended to stretch beyond the boundaries of the LGBTQ community and reach the wider Georgetown populace.
“We’re saying ‘This is a nationally recognized month to celebrate LGBTQ communities and we’re inviting the Georgetown community to take part in conversations and events that are in direct celebration of our LGBTQ communities,’” Haas said. “As part of OUTober we’re really just inviting the Georgetown community to be part of the conversation.”

The current federal minimum wage in the United States is historically low and unable to meet the needs of low-income Americans, according to a report released this month by Georgetown University’s Center on Poverty and Inequality and the Leadership Conference Education Fund.
The thesis of the report, entitled “Improving Wages, Improving Lives: Why Raising the Minimum Wage is a Civil and Human Rights Issue” asserted that the minimum wage affects minority groups at disproportionately high levels.
“While its wide range means today’s low minimum wage — including the tipped minimum wage harms a diverse range of people in America, it nevertheless disproportionately impacts people of color, women, LGBTQ individuals and other disadvantaged groups,” the introduction to the report states.
The report explained that minimum wage level jobs are disproportionately held by women and individuals of color. Michael Kirkpatrick, co-director of the Institute for Public Representation at the Georgetown University Law Center, explained that even without explicit discrimination, educational requirements set by employers effectively eliminate minorities and people of low income from consideration, leaving them stuck at the minimum wage level.
“Certain groups have a lower level of educational achievement, for example, and an employer has a minimum education requirement to get a certain job then that is going to disproportionally eliminate the minority candidates for that job and they will be left in the low-wage economy,” Kirkpatrick said.
Over 3 million workers work minimum wage jobs. The report pointed to the disparity between the cost of living and the minimum wage, which currently stands at $7.25 at the federal level, which translates to an annual income of $15,080, well below the poverty line for a family of two and down from the peak purchasing power of the minimum wage of $19,854 in 1968.
Center on Poverty and Inequality Senior Fellow Indivar Dutta-Gupta, the principal author of the report, noted that the federal minimum wage has been frozen at its current level since 2009, primarily due to a lack of bipartisan agreement in Congress.
“At the federal level you need Congress and the president to sign off and right now it’s virtually impossible to get anything significant passed in the Congress without 60 votes in the Senate. The reality is that there are not enough votes in the U.S Senate right now to result in a minimum wage increase,” Dutta-Gupta said.
In addition to federal partisanship, Dutta-Gupta also pointed to opposition from powerful industries and associations such as the National Restaurant Association, which cite concern over declines in employment and fewer benefits for employees.
“I think first of all the minimum wage increases under consideration now at the national level are very much within historical norms that suggest that there will be virtually no impact on employment. There is some chance that right now with the economy operating under capacity that a minimum wage increase could actually increase employment in the short run,” he said.
Although the federal minimum wage has not changed since 2009, 23 states and the District of Columbia have independently increased their price floors. On July 1, the District of Columbia raised its minimum wage to $9.50 and will increase it to $11.50 by 2016.

As part of Domestic Violence Awareness Month in October, the D.C. Coalition Against Domestic Violence launched a Spread Love D.C. Campaign across the city. The campaign partnered with the university by tabling in Red Square in an attempt to promote student discussion about their definition of love, in an event organized by the Georgetown University Student Association.
Through the campaign, DCCADV provided service to domestic violence survivors through 12 programs in the city and conducted public policy training, technical assistance and community education. According to DCCADV Advocacy and Communication Specialist Andrea Gleaves, the goals of this campaign are the prevention of violence and the promotion of healthy relationships.
“October being Domestic Violence Awareness Month, our campaign is focused on ‘Spread Love D.C.’ Our goal is to talk about prevention, about building healthy relationships in thriving communities so violence never has to happen,” Gleaves said.
In addition to the social media campaign on outlets like Instagram and Twitter, Gleaves stressed the importance of reaching out to college students to help the large community of college-aged sexual assault survivors.
“We actually have a partnership with all the universities here in D.C,” Gleaves said. “One in eight individuals in the District are college students. For sexual assault survivors, more than 40 percent who are seeking sexual assault services are between the ages of 18 and 25, which means that if we want to be talking about ending sexual violence and dating violence, we need to be targeting 18 to 25-years-olds. So universities are perfect places for us to go.”
According to GUSA Secretary of Student Safety and Health Nora West (SFS ’15), who organized the event, 21 percent of college students report experiencing dating violence by a current partner, and 22 percent of college women report having previously experienced dating violence. West pointed to the lack of recognition of domestic abuse as one of the primary problems surrounding the issue.
“Behaviors that might raise a red flag as something that can potentially be abusive won’t be thought of that way. So that doesn’t mean that dating violence isn’t happening. It just means that we are not recognizing it when it does,” West said.
GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) expressed his support for the Domestic Violence Awareness Month as filling a gap in sexual assault advocacy on campus.
“We’ve been doing a lot of work on sexual assault issues and tackling that on both the resource side and the jurisdiction side,” Tezel said. “But what we realized was that at Georgetown, we hadn’t done enough to recognize issues of domestic violence. As a good starting point, we can use this month as a way to communicate with our fellow students that domestic violence is a very serious concern and to educate about what a healthy relationship is.”
Programming for Domestic Violence Awareness Month on campus included a flag day on Oct. 15 to mark the red flags in relationships and a tabling event in Red Square on Oct. 16. GUSA will also co-host an interactive dialogue with the organization Breaking the Cycle on Oct. 27.
The tabling program in Red Square asked students to respond with their definition of love, which was papered on the walls of the square. West explained that the goal of tabling was to raise a momentary awareness in students who had never thought about dating violence before.
“We did think about it very purposefully when we planned it, understanding that before we hold the training and educate people about what it is and how it takes place on Georgetown’s campus, we first have to tell them that it is an issue on Georgetown’s campus,” West said.
Jingyu Zou (MSB ’18), a participant in Thursday’s tabling, was initially confused by the tabling, which seemed to focus more on love than on domestic abuse awareness.
“I was definitely not thinking about domestic violence because it’s a wall full of ‘love.’ I thought it was just the promotion of the act of ‘love’ itself,” Zou said. “But after I learned it was about domestic violence, I thought ‘OK, that’s cool. You need love in your family, not violence.’”
Gleaves also noted the importance of connecting survivors of domestic violence to resources to assist them. She said 40 percent of college students are unaware of to whom they should refer their abused friends.
“We want to engage students in a conversation around what are healthy behaviors, what are unhealthy behaviors and what are abusive behaviors,” Gleaves said. “Because the reality is there are survivors of dating violence on Georgetown’s campus, and we want to be able to connect them with the resources they need.”
Tezel appreciated the participatory nature of the tabling activity as students each have their own definitions for relationships.
“What I like about the programming for Domestic Violence Awareness Month is that it very much engages the students on this issue,” Tezel said. “It wants to hear your perspective because there’s no one right answer for how one relationship should be. As long as we can educate ourselves on what’s wrong, we can allow ourselves the liberty to have a flexible happy relationship in whatever forms that might take for us personally.”
Mentioning allies such as Sexual Assault Peer Educators, the Women’s Center, Counseling and Psychiatric Services and Take Back the Night, West hoped that this inaugural event would continue in future years.
“Hopefully we can create better institutional practices around this so that domestic violence awareness month happens continually every single year for October,” West said. “From there, the sky is really the limit in terms of where we can go with this. This has been an incredibly successful first year and I’m excited to see where it’s going to go next year.”

A panel of experts debated the European Court of Justice’s ruling about the right to be forgotten online at an event called “An Evening Not to be Forgotten” hosted by the university’s communication, culture and technology program in the Walsh Building on Monday evening.
The European Court of Justice ruled that under certain conditions, individuals have the right to ask search engines to remove links with personal information about them.
The event was moderated by Mark MacCarthy, an adjunct professor in the communication, culture and technology program. The panel was composed of Assistant Professor of Communications Meg Ambrose, Counsellor for the Digital Economy at the Delegation of the European Union Andrea Glorioso, 2014 Open Government Fellow John Tran and Gabe Rottman, the legislative counsel and policy advisor at the American Civil Liberties Union.
Glorioso said that she feels that the right to have expunged online records is fundamental for Europeans.
“We need to be very clear, that Europeans have the right to be protected and have the right to privacy when it comes to personal data. This is a fundamental right that all Europeans share. This has to be balanced with the right to freedom of expression, the right to access information and the right to conduct a business” Glorioso said.
MacCarthy questioned whether the court’s decision went too far.
“We tend to think of privacy and freedom of expression as two things that go together. But in fact, there is a tension between the two and there has always been. Privacy and freedom of expression no longer walk hand in hand,” MacCarthy said.“It makes me wonder whether if it essentially allowed privacy to choke free expression and maybe there needs to be balance and the extent to which privacy can weigh more heavily than freedom of speech.”
Tran said that he does not agree with this concept.
“I think that this way of framing the issue is actually inaccurate. It is not an issue of privacy versus freedom of expression, but rather privacy versus the public’s access to information and the commercial interest of search engines. I don’t think we should be pinning these two principles against each other,” Tran said. “I think a good example of that tension is that the court does not say that newspapers have to remove any information, because it touches on freedom of expression. I think that this is an important distinction which changes the framing of the discussion.”
Rottman also supports the decision of the court and said that it is unfair for personal information to be made public online.
“There is a social interest at stake here. I don’t discard the harm caused by the radical advances in our ability to collect and analyze information which is available to the public. This creates problems that we haven’t seen in a long time. If you wanted to go and find out whether someone has been arrested or divorced, now all of that is available in a click of a button, and this is a problem,” Rottman said.
Ambrose pointed out some issues that  may be caused by this ruling.
“Currently, when Google gets a take-down request, they not only have to verify that the user is who he or she claims to be, that they are from where they say they are from and then figure out what the right to be forgotten might mean in that country, which has not been decided for itself. This is a massive compliance task that they are having to deal with,”Ambrose said.
Madeline Westrick (SFS ’18), who attended the event, said that she liked the broad scope of opinions represented in the debate.
“I really appreciated the fact that there was a panel of different speakers, as opposed to just one person speaking individually and giving just their viewpoint. I was able to see the issue, which is quite a controversial one, from four different perspectives and that really helped me formulate a more educated opinion on the topic,” Westrick said.

Georgetown University has joined forces with 18 other universities across the United States to participate in END7, a group that has pledged to eliminate seven neglected tropical diseases by 2020.
The campaign was founded under the Global Network for Neglected Tropical Diseases, an initiative of the Sabin Vaccine Institute that aims to raise awareness, political will and funding to treat the one billion people affected by these debilitating diseases.
Georgetown University’s END7 chapter was founded in the spring and is currently run by co-presidents Ali Carter (COL ’15) and Collin Leibold (COL ’15).
This chapter has helped create a petition to the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, which was signed by over 1,100 students worldwide. Students in the College’s biology and global health major have also produced 10 education videos about NTDs and END7, bringing in over $300 in donations.
Leibold said he believes the university has maximum potential to impact the END7 campaign.
“I think Georgetown University is the perfect place to participate in the END7 campaign,” Leibold said. “This particular issue speaks to Georgetown’s international health focus, policy focus and Jesuit values. This is something we hope will be engrained in the back of students’ minds, which they carry throughout their education and careers.”
NTDs are parasitic and bacterial diseases including elephantiasis, river blindness, snail fever, trachoma, roundworm, whipworm and hookworm that affect the world’s poorest populations who are unable to access treatment.
END7 Resource Development Coordinator Emily Conron said that these seven diseases perpetuate the cycle of poverty, as  they often prevent those infected from completing schooling or obtaining a job. Conron founded END7 at the University of Notre Dame and is dedicated to connecting university students to eliminate NTDs.
“This international effort to control and eliminate the seven most common NTDs has the support of a diverse group of global partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO), national governments, pharmaceutical companies, foundations and individuals,” Conron wrote in an email. “END7 is connecting to universities because we believe involving students in this effort is critical to ensuring its success in the long and short term.”
The Sabin Vaccine Institute has created a mass drug administration plan that includes a combination of four drugs —  Albendazole or Mebendazole, Praziquantel, Zithromax and Diethylcarbamazine citrate or Mectizan. These drugs will be administered to entire populations in communities at risk to prevent, control and ultimately eliminate the seven most common NTDs.
END7 aims to increase fundraising for the transportation and drug administration costs, which are as low as 50 cents per child for a year.
Chapter Treasurer Michael McNamara (COL ’16) said that the Jesuit ideals deem helping eradicate NTDs a worthwhile cause.
“Being at a Jesuit university, we have certain ideals: social work, social justice and helping the poor,” McNamara said. “The reason that these diseases are neglected are because these people live in these very poor rural areas — and a lot of these diseases are caused by poverty.”
This year, the chapter aims to raise both awareness and meet a fundraising goal of $1,000, which would treat 2,000 children for a year. The Georgetown chapter did not receive funding from the university for this academic year and is currently looking for ways to fund its efforts. It does not receive funding from the Student Activities Commission.
“We are now in the process of having to tweak how we do our fundraisers, because our goal is to donate 100 percent of the proceeds,” Carter said. “The biology and global health major has offered to help aid financially, but our goal is to really raise awareness and educate the student body.”
The Georgetown chapter will also be holding weekly tables in Red Square throughout the semester, which will be accepting donations and will be available for discussions about END7 and NTDs.
“Understanding this issue is a bridge to deeper understanding of the complexities and challenges of global health, and we think students’ involvement in the campaign will make them more effective advocates for all the needs facing poor and vulnerable communities around the world,” Conron wrote.

The Climate Center at the Georgetown University Law Center has launched a new online tool that allows the public to view actions — or in some cases, the lack of actions — taken by states in response to climate change problems.
Funded in coordination with the MacArthur Foundation, the State Adaptation Progress Tracker aims to hold states and policymakers accountable to the environment.
“The purpose of this online tool was to be able to go a step further than saying these states have plans and be able to answer how those plans are being implemented in the states,” said Aaron Ray (GRD ’11), who is an institute associate at the Georgetown Climate Center.
Ray said that the creation of the tool required over a year of research and development.
“The first step was to identify the states that had plans and then research what was being done in those states relative to the plans,” Ray said.
Even though users will be able to use the tool to compare states, Ray emphasized that the tool is focused on policy progress instead of rankings.
“We really wanted to avoid ranking states in any way or saying that this state is doing better or worse than that state. The goal of this tool was to identify what states themselves had set as their priorities and get a sense of how those states were meeting their own goals,” Ray said.
The tool revealed that only 14 states have plans in place to respond to climate change, while nine others — including the District of Columbia — have planning in progress. Climate Center Executive Director Vicki Arroyo (LAW ’94) pointed to coastal states as particularly in need of governmental response from the states. She commended Maryland and California for their efforts to protect their citizens from climate change.
“Different states face different risks. But, I would point to states like Maryland and California, which are both coastal states that have done quite a bit, looking at what the risks are to infrastructure from sea-level rise. They’ve done two rounds of adaptation planning,” Arroyo said.
California passed “cool pavement” legislation in 2012 that promoted the use of light-colored pavement to mollify the heat-island effect in urban areas.
Georgetown University Student Association Secretary of Sustainability Caroline James (COL ’16) commended the tool for its more individualized focus, which is tailored to each state’s respective environment.
“Ways that we should combat climate change are going to vary by state. In Texas, we have lots of room and lots of profitable ways to use wind power to our advantage. … It’s going to be different than in New York, where maybe we’re addressing a smog problem,” James said. “What I appreciate about this tool is that it addresses the issue state-by-state because we have elected officials in our own states who we should be holding accountable.”
Ray said that he hoped that the tool would facilitate advocacy and action from the constituents residing in each state.
“We really want this to be useful to state-agency staff or leadership to get a sense of what their own state is doing in implementing their plan,” he said.
Arroyo agreed, pointing to increased transparency as a primary goal of the new feature.
“First and foremost, it will help people across the country to see whether or not their states are doing much at all yet in thinking about the impacts that are going to be facing them,” she said.
Georgetown has become increasingly engaged with environmental issues like climate change through initiatives like the Office of Sustainability, which was created last year.
Ray attributed the tool’s development to the engagement of the Georgetown community.
“The Climate Center is a national leader on these issues, but we really pull from the strength of the Georgetown community. Two primary researchers in this project were both Georgetown Law Center alums. It really is a product of the Georgetown community, not just of the Climate Center itself,” he said.
James agreed that the university is moving in the right direction with its sustainability plan but said that student engagement is still low.
“Many universities have a sustainability plan, and Georgetown is developing its own for the first time. I’ve been very pleased with some of the efforts that I’ve seen in developing that and making sure that students are consulted about what we want in a sustainability plan,” she said.
