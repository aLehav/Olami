The Georgetown University Student Association Mental Health Committee announced the creation of the Project Lighthouse mental health initiative Jan. 13, which will implement a peer-to-peer online chat service to let Georgetown students anonymously communicate with trained supporters on issues such as stress culture, sleep problems and thoughts of self-harm.
The initiative plans to welcome its first class of peer supporters through an eight-week training period from February to March, garnering support and resources from professionals in Georgetown’s Counseling and Psychiatric Services and Health Education Services.
After training volunteer peer supporters, Project Lighthouse will conduct a beta test in early April to evaluate student interest and begin plans to transition into full service by final exams in May. The initiative will tentatively be in operation every day of the week on evenings and nights, from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m.
GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff Ken Nunnenkamp (MSB ’16) said Project Lighthouse’s creation follows longstanding planning for a peer-driven mental health initiative, inspired by programs at other schools such as Cornell University’s Empathy, Assistance and Referral Service.
“I think a year and a half ago to two years ago [GUSA] brought up the idea of starting a program on campus similar to what Cornell has called EARS — they do mostly just phone call and in-person visits — but it’s the same thing, a peer-to-peer, student-run program,” Nunnenkamp said. “Cornell was one of those schools that I think suffers some of the highest rates of [depression]. It was a particularly effective program there.”
GUSA Undersecretary of Mental Health Ben Johnson (NHS ’17), who leads the GUSA Mental Health Committee, said Project Lighthouse fills an existing gap in mental health services on campus through directly connecting students to peers and focusing on the initial symptoms of mental illness.
“Our endeavor is to fill the gap of something very easy to access, of something that is not scary,” Johnson said. “This is a service that students can go to if they’re very confused and they don’t need to identify a big issue [to talk] about … it’s when they’re in the initial stages of feeling confused about where to go, Project Lighthouse will be their supporter.”
Nunnenkamp said Project Lighthouse serves as a way to lessen the workload for CAPS and other university mental health resources while providing a valuable service to students.
“There are a lot of great things that CAPS does and unfortunately due to funding problems, they’re over capacity, so this helps pick up the difference given the high volume of students who feel like they’re experiencing mental health problems.”
Nunnenkamp also stressed that Project Lighthouse will maintain a relationship with CAPS, but that Project Lighthouse advocates will not serve a direct role as formal counselors.
“We’re working with CAPS very closely — we’re very clear that we’re not counselors — we’re supporters, advocates, people who are just there to listen,” Nunnenkamp said.
Nunnenkamp said the response from potential applicants has been overwhelmingly positive.
“I’ve been so blown away by the enthusiasm and level of interest people have shown,” Nunnenkamp said. “A lot of our volunteers are coming from a psychology background … we’re lining up several other Georgetown professionals who are in the psychology department to talk and participate in the program as well.”
While the Project Lighthouse initiative will exist separately from the GUSA Executive, President Joe Luther (COL ’16) said he plans to support the initiative and is excited about the expansion of mental health resources on campus.
“Mental health has been a serious issue for us since Connor and I first began our GUSA campaign,” Luther wrote in a press release. “We are thrilled that Hoyas are actively working to improve and expand the mental health resources available to fellow Hoyas.”
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson also expressed his support for Project Lighthouse and acknowledged the importance of student initiative in increasing mental health resources.
“I really appreciate the students’ initiative and care in pursing this initiative,” Olson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I know they understand the importance of thoughtful training and strong preparation to assure that this is a valuable resource for our students. I am enthused to see this moving forward.”
According to Director of Health Education Services Carol Day, Project Lighthouse is a result of thoughtful collaboration between mental health professionals and students.
“The students that have been working on the Project Lighthouse initiative have collaborated with many key individuals in the university as part of their planning process,” Day wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We expect the service that trained students will eventually be providing will be a valuable resource for students to get support and link to important resources.”
Director of CAPS Phil Meilman expressed CAPS’s continuing support for Project Lighthouse.
“We look forward to supporting this new and creative venture at Georgetown and hope it will be of great benefit to students,” Meilman said.
GUSA Vice President Connor Rohan (COL ’16) said Project Lighthouse increases awareness of mental health issues on campus and will reach an increased number of Hoyas.
“Project Lighthouse will allow more students to receive assistance, improve knowledge about professional resources on campus, and reduce the stigma associated with seeking out mental health resources,” Rohan wrote.
Nunnenkamp said Project Lighthouse’s eventual objective is to standardize its curriculum in order to share resources with other colleges and universities nationwide.
“We’re hoping in the coming semesters to standardize and we hope we can create — starting at Georgetown, but then spreading to other schools — a national standardized curriculum and certification based on the work we’re doing here.”
According to Johnson, the Project Lighthouse initiative’s name symbolizes the program’s purpose.
“When we were trying to come up with the name of this project … we wanted to move away from acronyms because we didn’t just want to be another Georgetown organization,” Johnson said. “To me, a lighthouse is a service to help people find their way. It’s a light in the darkness.”
Michael Knuth (MSB ’16) said Project Lighthouse’s continual availability would greatly aid Georgetown students.
“On campus, we have this culture where we try and pretend everything’s okay instead of admitting that we need help, so just having that availability would really benefit students on campus here.”
Nick Ebert (SFS ’18), who is applying to be a Project Lighthouse program participant, said he was drawn to the initiative because he wants to help peers in their time of need.
“I know that with CAPS it’s very hard to get an appointment after the start of the semester. It’s either at the beginning or you almost can’t get one,” Ebert said. “This would be an opportunity for … enough people [to be] around to provide that resource all the time. It’ll be good to have people on the ground, able to talk.”

You say “decrease stigma”, and one hopes you mean “increase understanding.”

Laura Cutway began as Georgetown’s first dedicated, full-time Title IX coordinator Jan. 11, replacing temporary coordinator Vice President of Institutional Diversity and Equity Rosemary Kilkenny.
Cutway will be responsible for enforcing Georgetown’s sexual misconduct policy, investigating sexual misconduct and leading the school’s sexual misconduct education efforts.
Cutway previously served as the sexual assault and relationship violence liaison in Health Education Services at the Georgetown University Law Center, where she was charged with confidentially assisting survivors of sexual assault and raising awareness about sexual assault. Before that, Cutway served as director of the Office of Disability Services at the Law Center and the learning disability coordinator at the Catholic University of America.
Cutway earned a Master of Science in counseling and human relations from Villanova University, where she also earned her undergraduate degree.
In an interview with The Hoya, Cutway discussed Georgetown’s current climate toward sexual assault, her plans for the role and why she has pursued a career in social work.
What does Georgetown do well with regard to addressing issues of sexual assault, and what can it do better?
I think naturally I’m very proud of Georgetown and the way that they’ve handled sexual misconduct, and the stakeholders that have been involved — they’ve been very active in this arena for years. We’ve had a sexual assault working group for over two decades; people that have been very passionate about this work. I think the depth of our resources is one of our biggest strengths right now; we have many people devoted to this work. We have three full-time, confidential counselors.
I think our [Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey] that we just launched is a huge strength right now; it’s actually a really ideal time for me to join the team. I’m going to get hopefully a lot of really good information from that that I can then use to prioritize my initiatives moving forward. … In terms of things we could do better, I’m going to take a lot of guidance from the climate survey, to see what actually is going on on campus. I’m going to take a lot of that feedback from the students to see where I need to prioritize my initiatives.
I think, in general, educating 18,000 people on this issue is probably the area we need to do more work with — it’s a challenge. Just the numbers alone, it’s a big school, it’s hard to get people all on the same page about where to go, what all these definitions mean, what are the roles of certain people, so I think that in itself is a challenge … Streamlining some processes will help in navigating ‘who does what?’ and ‘where do I report things?’ and ‘what does that actually mean?’
What are your long-term goals for Georgetown in regard to sexual assault?
I’d love to get rid of sexual assault completely on campus, but I think, more realistically, providing a framework and confidence in our system so that people know what they would be getting involved in if they were to report, that they feel comfortable in that process, and confident in that process, that they’ll be able to feel heard throughout the process, both complainants and respondents. I want everybody to feel like it’s an equitable process and that along the way they have these resources that can help them, guide them, help them figure out what’s the best decision for them … As long as that whole process works, I think that would be a great place for the school to be in.
With that, [I hope to implement] some prevention mechanisms [like] bystander intervention … if I can build that training … [to shift] the culture to be a place where we take care of one another. And I think we do [that] in many ways, but to really give people the courage and empower them to actually stand up when they see that something doesn’t feel right.
What will having a dedicated, full-time Title IX Coordinator bring to Georgetown? Why is it important?
It’s hugely important. I think there are … many people doing really good work, but it’s often in addition to the other good work that they’re doing. [As a full-time person], I’ll have the time and the space to be able to really devote to what this role needs. And I think having a person that can see all the different themes that are emerging and see all the different needs, I can pull together and help manage that for the different folks that are involved and bring everybody together and make it a much clearer process for the students.
What do you see as the most important aspect of your role?
It would be hard to name one. I would say there would be two that would be equally important to me. One would be our response. I think [administration response] is hugely important for a student going through an assault, for the respondent also going through a claim, making sure that there’s a fair process in place.
And then also the training and education would be the other piece that’s fundamental to my role. That’s how we create change and make a culture shift and make this into an environment where it’s safe and respectful of one another.
Georgetown University Student Association and the administration reached an agreement in September to improve the campus climate towards sexual misconduct. What will your role be in helping to implement the agreement? What do you plan to do?
I see GUSA as a huge partner; they know the climate right now and can educate me on where the needs are. I think I’m there to help navigate their concerns that they bring up.
The more consistent language we have out there about resources and confidential counselors and Title IX the better. But just making sure that it’s consistent, I think sometimes there can be a problem where many different people are trying to put information out there that’s great, but we want to make sure that it’s all consistent language and consistent messaging so that people are clear, and it doesn’t become a more confusing process.
Your career experience so far has revolved around social work including addressing sexual assault. Why is it important for you to work to address these issues? Why did you go into this field and why are you still in it?
I think the honest answer is it’s been the most rewarding work that I’ve done. Working with somebody that’s gone through a sexual assault, you can really reach them at a time in their life when many other supports in their life aren’t as helpful; it’s not as comfortable to talk to your parent or friends or ministry, and so this is a time when you can really make a difference with somebody and you can … your response to somebody when they’re going through a trauma like this, can really aid in how the healing process works for them. … I also see it as that we have a responsibility to all of our students and so making it a fair process for everybody going through it. I see myself as an advocate: I’m not an advocate anymore for just survivors; I’m an advocate for all students.

The Institute of Politics and Public Service welcomed its spring 2016 class of fellows to campus for orientation Jan. 14.
The orientation marked the beginning of a semesterlong term for the five fellows, including former President of Costa Rica Laura Chinchilla (GRD ’89), senior politics editor for The Daily Beast Jackie Kucinich, former Deputy White House Political Director and Special Assistant to the President Patrick Dillon (COL ’99), former Mayor of Jacksonville, Fla., Alvin Brown and former deputy campaign manager for Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign Katie Packer.
For Brown, the program offers the chance for the fellows to engage with and learn from students in a political conversation.
“It’s a great opportunity to really connect with young people at one of the greatest institutions in the world and give them that perspective outside the Washington Beltway, to learn from them, see what’s on their minds, really try to inspire them to get involved in public service,” Brown said. “How do they view the world, and what matters to them?”
Chinchilla highlighted the program as an opportunity to gain insight from a new generation of students.
“The most important thing that I learned in politics was about listening to the people,” Chinchilla said. “I am interested in continuing to listen to others, mostly young people. They are bringing fresh views to many problems. I think that if we want to continue to stimulate political participation, we for sure need to learn from them.”
Over the course of eight weeks, the fellows will each lead weekly 90-minute discussion groups on a range of contemporary political topics and hold office hours open to all university students.
Kucinich, who will host a group called “Politics, the Culture Wars and the 2016 Primaries — What Makes the Republican and Democratic Primary Voters Tick,” said that the idea for her topic developed naturally due to the timing of the program.
“The Republican primary and the Democratic primary are starting at the same time as our discussion groups are,” Kucinich said. “So it’s a very natural thing to want to talk about. At The Daily Beast we cover a lot of politics, pop culture and culture wars, what makes people tick. This election has all of that.”
Packer, who will lead a group titled “The Force of Women in the Political Arena,” explained both the historical and current importance of the subject.
“I’ve spent the last couple of years communicating with women from a campaign standpoint,” Packer said. “What can we do looking forward to engage women to fully occupy the role that women should have in our society, in our public life? I thought it was an interesting historical and forward-looking issue to discuss, particularly for young women.”
Dillon, who will discuss “The Never-Ending Campaign: How Politics & Campaigns Matter Even More When the Election’s Already Over,” emphasized the need to develop a balanced outlook on politics.
“I believe that politics is and can be a force for good. I am aware that just saying that is not something that people automatically believe,” Dillon said. “I thought it was important to show how that works so students get an exposure to what that actually looks like in real life.”
Brown emphasized the need for politics to have both a national and local focus, a message he said he hopes to impart through his discussion group, “Success and Struggles of a 21st Century Mayor.”
“It comes out of my own personal experience and wanting students to really understand what happens at the local level and how the future of cities will be successful if we get those bright minds back out of the Beltway into the local community,” Brown said.
Chinchilla expressed the desire to expose students to new perspectives of the political landscape through her group, “Latin America and the Hispanic Community in the U.S. in the Context of the 2016 Presidential Campaign.”
“[I hope to] bring my perspective as a foreigner, discussing how some of the views could impact the future scenarios between the United States and Latin America and in other regions, which depend on the public policy and political processes in the United States,” Chinchilla said.
In addition to the discussion groups, each fellow will be assigned a five-person student strategy team to aid them in research and promotion of the program. Applications to join these teams closed Jan. 20 and successful applicants will be notified next week.
The teams will also take part in a political hackathon to identify and provide prescriptions to contemporary political issues, which they will present at the end of the semester. The solutions will be published online in the IPPS publication 37th and O.
For Kucinich, the program will be crucial in facilitating a dialogue between students and fellows from which both sides can benefit.
“Learning from the students is going to be one of the best parts of this whole process,” Kucinich said. “One of the things I hope they take away from what I’m doing is an understanding of the crazy way we pick our leaders every four years and how fun it can be to watch it.”
Packer said that she hopes to inspire students to become further involved with politics and potentially pursue careers in the field.
“Beyond what I hope to take away, my hope is to ignite a curiosity, or desire to dig deeper,” Packer said. “I also think that [students are] coming of age at a time when there’s a lot of cynicism about politics. … I think it’s much maligned, and that most people who run and hold office are good people who are in it for the right reasons. This hopefully will give the students a view into that, where they can see that there is still some nobility to it.”
Dillon echoed Packer’s sentiments, particularly emphasizing the opportunities offered to students at Georgetown and his excitement about helping them develop their interest in public service.
“I’m a big believer in the power of what a Georgetown education can do and the opportunities it opens up, particularly here in D.C.,” Dillon said. “To the extent that there’s students here trying to figure out what their path is … I hope that I can help them think through the ways they might do that and help them move a little bit farther down that path.”

Georgetown University released its first Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey to the student body Jan. 14 to gather relevant data on the prevalence of sexual violence on campus and to promote a better understanding of the issue among community members. It is the university’s first initiative of 2016 to bring renewed attention to the issue of sexual assault. The survey will remain open to students until Feb. 6, and its results will be published in May 2016.
President John J. DeGioia announced the survey’s release through an email to the student body Jan. 14. The Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action initiated the survey in partnership with the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action and the Office of the Provost.
The survey comes from a template developed by the Association of American Universities in late 2014. It was specifically tailored to Georgetown through the work of the Sexual Assault Working Group and a misconduct climate survey working group in order to gather the most relevant data possible. Twenty-seven universities such as Harvard, Yale and the University of Pennsylvania have all utilized the same AAU survey in their efforts to collect data on sexual assault prevalence on their respective campuses.
Georgetown University Student Association Secretary of Student Safety Maddy Moore (SFS ’17), who also serves on the Sexual Assault Working Group, said the greatest strength of using an AAU-based survey is the ability to compare the results with other universities.
“You are able to see and collect data on the communities students are a part of,” Moore said. “Whether that is based on identity or campus affiliation, our hope is that after synthesizing the data, we can come across patterns or particular groups that are impacted by the issue of sexual assault.”
The arrival of this year’s misconduct climate survey follows renewed attention and community demand for action with regard to the issue of sexual violence. In 2014 President Barack Obama established the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault to spearhead the fight against sexual violence on college campuses.
The U.S. Department of Education also released its own guidelines for schools to address sexual violence in April 2014, inspiring universities to begin developing and utilizing sexual assault climate surveys to better understand the violence’s pervasiveness and inform future policy.
“The university’s survey on sexual assault is a tool that is going to be critical for future progress on this issue,” GUSA President Joe Luther (COL ’16) said. “Too often we are told that there simply aren’t enough statistics to justify policy or structural changes. This survey is going to inform conversations on an administrative level for a long time and it’s crucial that we have accurate statistics to work with.”
Vice President for Institutional Diversity and Equity Rosemary Kilkenny, who also serves on the Sexual Assault Working Group, noted that in order for Georgetown to find the most effective policy measures, the survey needed to be tailored specifically for the university and gather a wide variety of data.
“The first goal was to access the extent to which sexual assault and sexual misconduct is on our campus,” Kilkenny said. “How prevalent is it? How widespread is it? Is it occurring in particular areas and locations? Is there a disparity between the undergraduate and graduate level? This will give us the opportunity to know.”
Kilkenny also emphasized the importance of seeing how well-informed students are about the prevalence of sexual assault and the resources available to victims.
“This survey will continue to give us an idea of the resources available to students and how they have been tapped in to,” Kilkenny said. “For those students who may have been a survivor of sexual assault, it may be good to know why they didn’t come forward, so there are places in the survey where students can identify such areas.”
While the survey is a major step forward in an effort to gather data on sexual assault on campus, other universities have encountered issues with gathering enough student participation to make informed judgments and craft effective policy. In order to overcome the issue of participation, a marketing group was established to create effective marketing strategies.
The marketing team’s strategy has focused on drawing attention to the survey through various slogans placed on table cards, posters in dorms and a banner in Red Square. A thermometer has also been set-up in Red Square to represent ongoing student participation in the survey. The thermometer includes participation levels attained by schools such as Harvard and Yale in order to incentivize the student body to surpass those numbers.
“We pretty carefully studied other schools and how they went about their marketing strategies, so we took what we liked from them and combined it with what we thought would work best at Georgetown,” misconduct climate survey marketing group member Grace Smith (COL ’18) said. “But the success of the survey depends on the participation of each and every one of us. It’s our voices that will be the most impactful, and this survey is the platform for all of us.”
Current reactions to the survey have been positive, with many students welcoming the chance to be part of an important and influential dialogue. Jackson Cushner (COL ’17) said he appreciated the initiative the survey represents, but hoped the rest of the student body will take it upon themselves to continue the dialogue on an individual level.
“It’s great that Georgetown and other schools are making an effort here, but the solution really exists on an individual level,” Cushner said. “Individuals who respect the dignity of other individuals won’t sexually assault them, period. It’s not about statistics or fear or anything like that, it’s about respect.”
Smith said she appreciates the steps the university administration has taken by implementing the survey and other intiatives such as planning a town hall on sexual violence in the spring and the introduction of new Title IX Coordinator Laura Cutway.
“One of the biggest takeaways is that the administration really does care and is listening and is actively making efforts to improve the resources for students who are impacted by the issue,” Smith said.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said the survey is an integral part of a broader plan by the university to combat sexual misconduct on the hilltop.
“Our long-term goal is to do everything we can to eradicate sexual assault, sexual violence on our campus,” Olson said. “This is a long-term effort, but this survey along with the educational efforts we have in place, the resources we have in place, the staff we have in place, this is all aimed in that direction.”

The Georgetown University Student Association met with student government leaders from other Washington, D.C. universities Thursday to discuss a proposed bill that would allow for expanded jurisdiction for private security officers, including campus police.
The bill, which was introduced by D.C. Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie (D-Ward 5) Dec. 16, includes new regulations for special police officers, which include campus security, housing project staff and hospital officers. Under the bill, the Georgetown University Police Department would have the ability to enforce the code of conduct outside of its current jurisdiction, which includes buildings that the university owns, operates or leases.
“A campus or university special police officer … may exercise his or her authority as an officer outside the property or area he or she is appointed to protect,” the bill reads. “[This is] pursuant to a public safety plan submitted to, and approved by, the Chief of Police.”
The bill was introduced in response to the death of Alonzo Smith, a D.C. resident who died while in the custody of private security guards, with the aim of increasing training requirements for special police.
The bill is co-sponsored by Councilmembers LaRuby May (D-Ward 8), David Grosso (I-At Large), Elissa Silverman (I-At Large), Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3), Anita Bonds (D-At Large) and Phil Mendelson (D-Chairman).
Student association presidents from George Washington University, American University, Howard University and Catholic University attended the consortium and expressed opposition to the bill.
GUSA President Joe Luther (COL ’16) and Vice President Connor Rohan (COL ’16) said that GUSA does not support the bill’s clause expanding GUPD’s jurisdiction.
“GUSA is universally opposed to this bill,” Rohan said. “We have serious concerns about the extent to which police can be trained to control off-campus areas, concerns about civil liberties.”
Rohan also disapproved of giving the university’s neighbors the power to contact GUPD directly. Currently, neighbors must report problems concerning Georgetown students living off-campus to the Office of Neighborhood Life.
GUPD Chief Jay Gruber said that GUPD is in favor of the bill and clarified that GUPD does not plan on using some of the powers granted to it under the bill, including the ability to actively monitor off-campus areas.
“We’re in favor of the bill, but our focus is narrower than the wording of the bill,” Gruber said. “All we’re interested in is responding to student conduct and administrative violations in the designated area off-campus.”
If the bill is implemented, Gruber said that GUPD would only respond, as it does now, to off-campus situations if the Office of Neighborhood Life is unable to send one of its own members to investigate a neighbor’s complaint.
“We wouldn’t do anything that’s proactive. … It’s a very narrow area where we would be doing these things,” Gruber said. “We wouldn’t be patrolling in the neighborhoods looking for loud parties. We would wait for somebody to make their complaint.”
Rohan emphasized distinctions between Metropolitan Police Department and GUPD responses to conduct violations as another factor behind GUSA’s opposition to the bill.
“The actions that MPD takes are going to be different than the actions that GUPD takes,” Rohan said. “When GUPD enters the area … the potential for code of conduct violations to be pursued by GUPD and forwarded to the Office of Student Conduct is much greater, even if what a student is doing may not be illegal under D.C. law.”
Gruber said that he understood concerns over GUPD being able to enforce the code of conduct in areas off-campus, but also expressed the view that GUPD may better respond to student conduct violations than MPD.
“I understand the students’ apprehension of thinking that another group of people will enforce [the code of conduct],” Gruber said. “[But] I think it’s better handled internally by my department than someone calling MPD.”
The bill has been referred to the Council’s judiciary committee and requires a signature from Mayor Muriel Bowser as well as a 30-day congressional review before it can take effect.

In response to the recent series of mass shootings around the country, President Barack Obama outlined a set of executive actions to address the issue of gun violence in a speech given from the White House Jan. 5.
The president began his address by referencing recent shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., and Colorado Springs, Colo., repeatedly emphasizing the frequency and magnitude of gun violence in America.
“We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees this kind of mass violence erupt with this kind of frequency,” Obama said. “It doesn’t happen in other advanced countries. It’s not even close. And as I’ve said before, somehow we’ve become numb to it and we start thinking that this is normal.”
Acknowledging that gun control had turned into a fierce partisan debate, Obama noted that he recognized the validity of the Second Amendment but also said that it is possible to reduce gun violence within its bounds.
“We understand there are some constraints on our freedom in order to protect innocent people,” Obama said. “We cherish our right to privacy, but we accept that you have to go through metal detectors before being allowed to board a plane. It’s not because people like doing that, but we understand that that’s part of the price of living in a civilized society.”
The executive actions outlined by the president in the second half of his speech featured requirements imposed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives on licensing and background checks for firearm sellers. They also include the Federal Bureau of Investigation overhauling the background check system with over 230 additional staff and 200 new ATF agents to enforce gun laws as well as establishing an internet investigation center to track illegal online firearms trafficking.
With regard to mental health and gun control, the Obama Administration is also proposing a $500 million investment to increase access to health care and the Social Security Administration. The Department of Health and Human Services is also revamping legal barriers for people prohibited from owning guns for mental health reasons.
As he concluded, the president spoke of the challenges and realities of gun violence and the continued need for action.
“Yes, it will be hard, and it won’t happen overnight,” Obama said. “It won’t happen during this Congress. It won’t happen during my presidency. But a lot of things don’t happen overnight. A woman’s right to vote didn’t happen overnight. The liberation of African Americans didn’t happen overnight. LGBT rights — that was decades’ worth of work. So just because it’s hard, that’s no excuse not to try.”
Georgetown Against Gun Violence President Emma Iannini (SFS ’16) expressed optimism about Obama’s executive actions.
“It certainly will make a difference,” Iannini said. “The main constructs of the executive actions are going to make the system not only more efficient but also more comprehensive.”
However, she said that these actions do not address several major loopholes in gun purchase legislation.
“This isn’t going to completely erase the problem that is caused by the gun show sale loophole and the internet loophole — we need Congress to ultimately fix those problems once and for all — but it will make sure that fewer individuals who should not be allowed to have dangerous firearms don’t fall through the cracks,” Iannini said.
GAGV Vice President Sarah Clements (COL ’18) echoed Iannini’s sentiments on Obama’s recent actions.
“As an advocate working on this issue I always want to be celebratory of any steps that we take to move forward,” Clements said. “It was a big win — there is more that our movement wants to get accomplished in the near future, but at the same time, it’s really nice to have something we can grasp on for now.”
Clements said that the executive actions are important in enforcing laws already on the books.
“Knowing that so many incidents of gun violence are preventable just adds to the grief but is also the motivating factor,” Clements said. “It’s all about gun safety, safe storage, and making sure we have the legislation in place that protects our families.”
McCourt School of Public Policy Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Mark Rom expressed a more skeptical outlook on the recent policy action.
“We are a country just awash in guns,” Rom said. “So any actions that we take are unlikely to have a major impact on gun violence both because of the extent of guns out there and also because of the difficulty of actually enforcing things that would make gun safety higher.”
Rom emphasized that any executive action requires federal funding and that Congress is likely to try and block this funding. He attributed this to America’s unique stance on guns.
“It is important to note how unusual the United States is in how polarized we are on this issue,” Rom said. “There is more consensus on background checks and that is important, but it is also striking that, given this consensus of the public on background checks, Congress has been completely unwilling to take any actions to make those background checks more thorough and more uniform.”

Professor Dan Nexon drew comparisons from the “Star Wars” saga to modern political science at a conversation in the Mortara Center for International Studies on Wednesday. The event, titled “Star Wars as Political Science Fiction,” was attended by over 50 people as part of the Mortara Center’s Culture and Politics lecture series. Director of the Mortara Center Kathleen McNamara said the event aimed to begin the new semester on a light note.
“The goal of the event was, number one, to have fun at the beginning of the semester, before everybody’s sort of buried in their books,” McNamara said.
Nexon, a “Star Wars” fan since he saw the original movie when he was five years old, used his knowledge as a political scientist and academic to explore various features of the movie franchise as both a cultural phenomenon and political science fiction. Using a flashing blue lightsaber as a presentation pointer, Nexon connected a variety of theories and arguments from international relations and other academic disciplines to aspects of the films that represent cultural barometers, political critiques and general social mythology. Nexon focused much of his talk on “Star Wars’” most recent release, “The Force Awakens”, which is the third highest-grossing film in history at press time, with a global profit of over $1.88 billion. Nexon explored the controversy surrounding the casting of the main characters of the film.
“The new version has been widely celebrated and even decried by a few, for having a different kind of cast of characters: a female Jedi in training … an African-American male and a Hispanic man,” Nexon said. “We think it’s important, if you have certain kinds of values, to see different kinds of faces, different kinds of genders, different kinds of races represented in something like ‘Star Wars’.”
Nexon said the mass media representation of these different types of characters contributes to the general shaping of popular attitudes and public imagination, especially among younger viewers.
“To me personally, as somebody who has a daughter, who loves science fiction and fantasy and has had a very difficult time with the ways in which popular culture gets filtered down to her, it was really exciting to see this [type of casting] for the first time,” Nexon said.
Nexon added that the political implications of the movie franchise have occasionally appeared in the national political forum, particularly in 1983, when President Ronald Reagan announced the Strategic Defense Initiative, a missile defense system aimed to protect the country from nuclear attack.
“Critics soon labeled [the SDI] Star Wars to discredit it, and say ‘Oh this is science fantasy, it could never be true,’” Nexon said. “This is a horrible tactical blunder, because what is the purchase of “Star Wars” on the imagination? It’s the good guys fighting the evil empire, and so the advocates of Star Wars quickly appropriated that label and turned it against their critics.”
Nexon said the fantasy universe stands with other complex fantasy fictions as commercialized forms of folklore.
“In our modern society, we don’t have folklore anymore, which is public property. Folklore is commercially owned; it’s produced through mass media,” Nexon said. “Now, the fact is, I think that ‘Star Wars’ is modern folklore, and I would make the same claim about ‘Harry Potter’, but ‘Star Wars’ is really in some ways our most powerful folkloric product of the last half-century.”
Nexon concluded the discussion by emphasizing how examining one’s own culture deeply, as in the case of “Star Wars”, can be an enlightening experience.
“One way to approach this stuff is to say that this is just commercial entertainment, that you should just sit back and enjoy it,” Nexon said. “But where’s the fun in that?”
Nivu Jejurikar (SFS ’18) said she appreciated one of the talk’s lessons about the relationship between culture and politics, noting how closely related the two fields are in both the film saga and reality.
“I think that one point that was interesting was that culture and politics affect each other symbiotically … so I thought that was an interesting concept and one that is applicable not only to the ‘Star Wars’ series but also to other movies and works of art that are a part of our culture,” Jejurikar said.
Preston Marquis (SFS ’16) said he enjoyed the critical engagement of “Star Wars” fans at the event.
“It’s not very often you get a bunch of ‘Star Wars’ nerds in the same room to have a very intellectual discussion about the real-world applicability of what ‘Star Wars’ means,” Marquis said. “It was a great day for Star Wars fans and for political science students alike.”

Former University Registrar John Q. Pierce (CAS ’72) announced in a Jan. 8 email to the Georgetown community that he has left the position of registrar and will instead serve as an assistant provost in the registrar’s office before retiring at the end of the spring semester.
Pierce has worked at Georgetown for over 40 years, and has served as university registrar for 32 years.
Pierce began working for Georgetown in the School of Continuing Studies as a student worker before moving on to work for the registrar’s office after he graduated in 1972. During his tenure as university registrar, he has overseen the automation of Georgetown’s course registration, as well as the implementation of the MyDegree Audit system. Pierce was recently recognized with the Georgetown Alumni Admissions Program Board of Advisors Award for his longstanding contributions to the university.
“It has been an honor and a pleasure for me to be able to serve Georgetown and its faculty and students as University Registrar for the past thirty-two years,” Pierce wrote. “I pray that you will be happy, successful and committed to the service of others so as to make the world a better place as you move through your life.”
In an interview with The Hoya, Pierce said that he is proud of Georgetown’s commitment to Jesuit education and values and is grateful for the impact Georgetown has had on his life.
Pierce said that he is looking forward to spending time with his grandchildren during his retirement and that he may audit a language class at Georgetown.
The university has not yet announced who will replace Pierce as registrar.
A long form feature on Pierce’s tenure, accomplishments and views on Georgetown’s transformation and future direction will appear in a forthcoming issue of The Hoya.

Professor of Middle East Studies at Sciences Po, Paris School of International Affairs Jean-Pierre Filiu stressed necessary measures that both Palestinians and Israelis should take in order to pacify current regional tensions at an event in the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies Boardroom Jan. 15. The lecture, which was hosted by the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies, focused on the recent escalation of tension and violence between Israelis and Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Tel Aviv.
Filiu, who previously held visiting professorships at the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs and the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, has written 10 books and served as a diplomatic advisor for various French government offices.
Filiu’s remarks centered on the ongoing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians that intensified in the summer of 2014 when Hamas soldiers from the Gaza Strip exchanged rocket fire with Israeli military forces stationed at the border. According to Filiu, the recent conflict was the most devastating to the Gaza Strip and its residents, but it was neither unexpected nor unprecedented.
“On this very Friday, two Palestinian young adults were shot dead at the so-called ‘border’ between the Gaza Strip and Israel,” Filiu said. “According to the Israeli military sources they were provoking the Israeli military. This has become the new normal. … This is absolutely tragic.”
Filiu opened his remarks by saying that in order for one to understand how to resolve the current conflict — especially in the Gaza Strip — observers must understand the history of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians that has led up to this most recent confrontation.
“Gaza has been under this terrible military pressure from day one,” Filiu said. “[Gaza] is what is left once everything else has been taken.”
Filiu said that Israel has engaged in twelve wars against militants in the Gaza Strip, including the conflict in the summer of 2014.
“The Gaza Strip has been created through war, when the state of Israel was created, but Gaza was an oasis. It was a place where people met and traded,” Filiu said. “That was the whole function of Gaza for millennia.”
Filiu said that the effects of Israel’s violent exchanges with Gaza have converted the historically diverse and fertile region into a prison.
“It is the greatest open-air prison in the world, which is not an analogy I fully support, because I do not know many prisons when, during moments of riots, the wardens routinely shoot at the inmates,” Filiu said. “This is the case in Gaza.”
Filiu then traced the history of Gaza-Israel conflicts, including the context surrounding the creation of the Israeli state and the absorption of formerly Palestinian-claimed lands. Among the conflicts, he cited the first and second intifadas as the seventh and eighth wars respectively, and highlighted the implementation of the policies of closure after the first intifada.
Filiu also discussed a concept he coined ‘lawn mowing,’ an effort by Israel to occasionally intervene in Gaza to stifle resistance, as an embodiment of the decades of violence and tension.
The turning point in the ongoing conflict, according to Filiu, was in June 2007, when Hamas won legislative elections in Gaza. After the election, Israel declared Gaza a hostile entity and tensions have only risen since.
“Since then, no Israeli has entered Gaza, except in a tank,” Filiu said. “This means the people of Gaza only know Israelis for the wrong things — the killings.”
Filiu said there is a realistic possibility of Palestinian nationalist movements cooperating with the Islamic State group and Egyptian insurgents, potentially dragging Egypt into war and forcing Israel to intervene in the Sinai Peninsula.
“Israel going into Sinai would mean the end of the Camp David agreement,” Filiu said. “I would not like to live in that world.”
Filiu recommended an immediate and unconditional lifting of the blockade on the Gaza Strip, both on the mainland and in the sea. A major point of contention between Palestinians and Israel has been an enforced fishing zone that limits the waters where fishermen can cast their nets.
“It is not something you do because you are nice. It is something you have to do to avoid catastrophe,” Filiu said. “The border should be opened tomorrow and a sea line opened at least to Cyprus.”
During the question-and-answer session following his address, Filiu expressed his support for a two-state solution.
“Palestinians need a flag and a passport. A two-state solution is the only way out and it is not an illusion,” Filiu said. “You don’t change the word ‘war’ because of casualties. War is war.”
Filiu said that he believes the next war between Israel and Palestinians will be far worse, just as each previous war has been worse than the one preceding.
“These people don’t need help,” he said. “They need freedom.”
Ari Shapiro (SFS ’18) said that Filiu’s remarks on the conflict’s background were insightful and informative, but he did not agree with some definitions and personal arguments.
“I generally really appreciated what the professor said about the issues and the history,” Shapiro said. “I disagree with his definitions of war and his definitions of Israeli wars.”
Elizabeth Bujwid (SFS ’18), who asked about the role the United States would play in facilitating dialogue between the two entities, said she enjoyed the discussion, finding Filiu’s critiques and observations on the ongoing dialogue welcome.
“It was really important to hear from an independent observer,” Bujwid said.

Fr. Richard Curry, S.J., professor of Catholic studies and theater and founder of Dog Tag Bakery, died from heart failure Dec. 20 at the age of 72. Curry worked at Georgetown for 10 years.
Curry also served as director of the Academy for Veterans, a program that serves to assist veterans returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan who have been disabled in the line of duty with emotional rehabilitation, employment assistance and other services.
Dog Tag Bakery, which he founded in December 2014, seeks to employ veterans and their spouses while teaching tangible business skills. The bakery also has a partnership with the Georgetown School of Continuing Studies to offer employees night courses in small-business administration and entrepreneurship.
Curry said in a 2014 article in The Hoya [“Bakery Prepares for Launch,” The Hoya, Nov. 14, 2014] that the bakery offers veterans the chance to pursue their dreams.
“Everyone should make the most of this opportunity. All of you veterans have great business ideas and you may find someone here with a similar idea and the means with which to make your dream come true,” Curry said.
Before joining Georgetown, Curry founded both the National Theater Workshop of the Handicapped, which offered disabled individuals the chance to perform, and the Belson Bakery Training School, which serves to teach disabled individuals how to bake and work at the bakery. Curry is also the author of two cookbooks.
Curry was well known at Georgetown for his unique “Theater and the Catholic Imagination” class, which served to teach expression and culminated with a tap-dance performance around campus, including in O’Donovan Hall and the Intercultural Center.
Rev. Joseph E. Lingan, S.J., wrote in a campus-wide email Dec. 21 that Curry’s religious and charitable work came hand in hand.
“Fr. Curry’s work with bread, soups, and desserts was an outward manifestation of his inner hunger for the Lord,” Lingan wrote in the email. “He sought to share that hunger with others, and to help others satisfy such hunger through an encouragement to deepen one’s faith by stretching one’s imagination and heart.”
Curry said in an article in Saint Joseph’s University magazine that faith is what allowed him to be successful in life.
“At six because of my arm, I was told I could not be a soldier. I could not be a priest. I could not be a doctor,” Curry said. “Well, I have a doctorate, I’m a priest and I’m working with the military. I think that’s proof that it’s not smart to circumscribe God.”
Curry received the Distinguished Service Award of the President’s Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities in 1987, and received 25 honorary degrees from universities and colleges, including Georgetown University and Fordham University.
The New York Times, The Boston Globe and the Washington Post all published obituaries for Curry.
Curry earned a Ph.D. in theater from New York University in 1977, a M.A. in theater from Villanova University, and his undergraduate degree from St. Joseph’s University.
A memorial mass for Curry will be held on Jan. 27 at 4 p.m. in Dahlgren Chapel. Full obituary to come.

The McCourt School of Public Policy and the Lugar Center unveiled the latest addition to their Bipartisan Index Dec. 15 with lifetime scores for senators from 1993 to 2014.
The Bipartisan Index, originally launched in May 2015, calculates a score for each senator based on an algorithm that takes into account how frequently they co-sponsor a bill with a member of the opposite party. The algorithm also accounts for whether a senator belongs to the majority or minority party, the volume of bipartisan bills and their relative importance.
The lifetime scores reflect how a senator behaved compared to a similar cohort of congressmen over the past 20 years, with a score of 0 indicating an exactly average performance in terms of bipartisan cooperation. Positive and negative scores indicate above-and below-average performances, respectively.
The data revealed escalating levels of partisanship in the Senate over the past two decades, as well as subpar bipartisan performance among all six presidential contenders who currently or previously served in the Senate.
The rankings catalogued the records of six presidential candidates who previously or currently served on the Senate, all of whom scored in the negative range. Of the 227 senators scored, Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) ranked at number 145, Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) at 156, Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) at 170, Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) at 217, Rand Paul (R-Ky.) at 222 and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) at 224.
Lugar Director of Policy Dan Diller said that the creation of the Bipartisan Index stemmed from the desire of the center, a nonprofit public policy institution, to quantifiably measure the scarcity of cooperation in Congress today. After developing the idea for the index, the center approached the McCourt School in Oct. 2014 to establish an academic partnership on the project.
“We live in a time of great contention,” Diller said. “Problems do not get solved because there is a level of combat inherent in American politics today that is just unhealthy. … From a political science view, you want some confirmation that there are measurable tendencies to say, ‘Yes, indeed, we have a problem.’”
Diller emphasized that although the chasm between Democrats and Republicans continues to expand, the updated index did not indicate that one party was more bipartisan than the other. In fact, of the 60 most bipartisan Senators, the results were evenly split among 30 Democrats and 30 Republicans. Within the 100 top-scoring Senators, there were 51 Democrats and 49 Republicans.
McCourt Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Mark Rom said that the presidential candidate results may be of little surprise to the public. Of the six former or current senators now running for presidential office, Rom said he found Clinton’s score the most unexpected.
“Clinton is surprising to find in the lower third of pack,” Rom said. “She paints herself as a centrist and she comes from a state with a tradition, governors like George Pataki and Rudy Giuliani, which shows New York is accepting of conservatives the way Texas is not very supportive of liberals.”
Rom stressed that while the rankings provide a useful resource for the electorate, they are unlikely to have a major influence on voters.
“I had discussion with the Lugar Center, and they believed posting these rankings would help the cause of bipartisanship, and I was concerned that it might hurt the cause,” Rom said. “Constituents might look at this and say, ‘You’re too moderate. You’re too bipartisan. I want somebody who is more ideologically pure.’ Ultimately, I think these kind of rankings provide only a kind of marginal impact on people’s decisions.”
Alex Coopersmith (COL ’19), who volunteers for the Clinton campaign and will help during the New Hampshire primary, said that he remains supportive of Clinton regardless of the rankings.
“It’s interesting that Hillary Clinton is that low because I remember when I was reading her book ‘Hard Choices’ about her time in the Senate, she touted her bipartisan efforts,” Coopersmith said. “She’s a progressive but also very pragmatic, and that is the kind of leader I want: someone who runs for president because they want to govern, not because they want to fire up a base.”
Former Chair of the Georgetown University College Republicans Amber Athey (COL ’16), who is gravitating toward either Rubio or Cruz as her preferred Republican nominee, said that bipartisanship is not necessarily a virtue in a politician.
“For me, I think spending is a big one, because just look at the size of the national debt right now,” Athey said. “That’s why I kind of appreciate that Cruz is more fringe, more anti-establishment, because it’s nice to see that someone is actively battling against the tricks that some senators use to deceive the public.”
Similarly, Caleb Weaver (SFS ’16), a co-founder of the Georgetown chapter of College Students for Bernie Sanders, said that his admiration for Sanders stemmed largely from the senator’s steadfast devotion to his vision.
“My model is not a candidate who says everyone can get along, everyone can agree on things, we can all work together all the time,” Weaver said. “When it comes to certain key issues, I admire someone who says, ‘Not everyone will like me, but if you like me, you should support me.’”

The Georgetown University Police Department released a new website and training program Jan. 13 for how to act in the event of an active shooter.
Created in conjunction with the Department of Emergency Management and Continuity of Operations, the website includes information and resources to use in an active shooter situation, intervention and prevention resources, a registration form for the training course and an outline of the “Run, Hide, Fight” protocol.
The training program is a 30-minute course that draws from federal law enforcement practices and is taught by GUPD officers and DEMOC members. The course incorporates the concept of “See Something, Say Something” and is meant to instruct groups.
GUPD Chief Jay Gruber said that recent shootings, both in the United States and in other countries, inspired the formation of the website and program.
“We think it’s very important because with a lot of the more recent shootings in Paris and San Bernardino, it really became important for us to make sure that our students, faculty and staff knew what to do in an active shooter situation,” Gruber said. “We thought it was important to actually be able to do some training and provide some really direct information, so that’s why we developed a website and that’s why we want to do these half-hour trainings for people on campus.”
Gruber said that although the training programs are directed at student groups, the majority of groups that have signed up are faculty and staff.
“There haven’t been a lot of student groups signed up. They’re really our target audience,” Gruber said.
Gruber added that the course would be available 24 hours a day for student groups.
Although the website and the training programs were created as a consequence of recent shootings, Gruber said that there is no immediate threat to the Georgetown area.
“There’s no recent threats in our area, there’s been no recent shootings in our area or anything else that has prompted us locally to increase our push for people to be trained and to understand active shootings,” Gruber said.
