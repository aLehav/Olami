The seven Georgetown University Student Association vice presidential candidates advocated their tickets’ respective platforms Wednesday in a debate largely centered on GUSA’s interaction with other student groups.
Taking the stage in a packed White-Gravenor classroom, the candidates generally shied away from the rhetoric of their running mates in favor of outlining their specific proposals.
GUSA’s influence over student groups was a point raised in Sunday’s presidential debate, but the topic became a major theme of the questions directed toward the vice presidential candidates.
Candidates disagreed on whether GUSA should subsidize room reservation fees that groups must pay to the Office of Campus Activity Facilities. GUSA Director of Executive Outreach Maggie Cleary (COL ’14) and Lauren Weber (COL ’13), a member of The Hoya’s board of directors, defended the policy. The budget laid out by Cleary and her running mate, Finance and Appropriations Committee Chair Colton Malkerson (COL ’13), covers OCAF subsidies.
Weber and her running mate John Morris (COL ‘13) have proposed allowing groups to apply to the GUSA Fund, through which student organizations can apply for additional funding throughout the semester, for money to help defray reservation costs.
GUSA senator Sheila Walsh (COL ’14), running with Senate Vice Speaker Nate Tisa (COL ’14), disagreed and argued that student activities fee funding should be controlled by student groups themselves. Senator Vail Kohnert-Yount (COL ’13), on a ticket with senator Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13), acknowledged her own struggles with OCAF during her tenure as chair of the College Democrats but expressed concern that GUSA’s OCAF subsidies would not be distributed equally across organizations.
“The best people to equitably distribute that money would be the student groups themselves,” Kohnert-Yount said.
Men’s basketball point guard Markel Starks (COL ’14), who is running on a ticket with senator Daniel LaMagna (COL ’13), failed to produce a substantive response about OCAF subsidies and was unable to address the similarity of his ticket’s proposed Georgetown smartphone application to one currently being development by the university. He did, however, raise the point that students must also pitch in to improve campus life, suggesting that the campus rat problem could be avoided if students living in apartments took out their trash more frequently.
Candidates were also asked how they would aid the sports and arts communities if elected. Kohnert-Yount emphasized the necessity of increased space for these communities and more efficient use of the space that they currently have.
GUSA Secretary of Information and Technology Michael Crouch (MSB ’13) suggested that the arts community is somewhat isolated from the rest of the student body, something that his ticket hopes to combat through an outdoor concert by student performers. Crouch, who is running with GUSA Director of Special Projects Tyler Sax (COL ’13), also called for increased alumni engagement with the arts community. Sax and Crouch have proposed a program to strengthen the relationship between clubs and alumni.
All candidates expressed an interest in enhancing diversity-related outreach. Weber promised to engage both well-known diversity organizations such as the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access and niche groups like the Caribbean Culture Circle. Kohnert-Yount, a member of the only all-female ticket in the campaign, proposed reaching out to diversity organizations and encouraging members to run for positions in GUSA.
Michael Appau (COL ’13), who is running with GUSA Fund Chair Murphy Kate Delaney (COL ’13), hopes to better publicize the diversity-related programs that GUSA offers. He also stressed the importance of diversity within the GUSA executive branch.
“By making diversity open at the top, people will be willing to approach us more easily,” Appau said.
Candidates concluded the debate by reiterating the qualities of their platforms that set their tickets apart.
Cleary emphasized her ticket’s experience and connections within the university administration, as well as her platform’s relevance to student concerns.
Crouch and Appau both expressed interest in raising awareness of GUSA by better engaging students. Kohnert-Yount advocated for an executive branch with a foundation in Jesuit values as well as community and diversity, while Weber said her ticket would strive to ensure that students felt at home from the moment they stepped on campus.
Walsh emphasized the importance of working collaboratively with advisory boards and other student-led groups.
“We’ll work with organizations like the [Student Group Union], people who are autonomous but will feed us ideas for which we can then advocate,” she said.
Starks promised, if elected, to stay involved with GUSA via Skype when his team is on the road.
“We’re all in,” he said.

While some students spend several hours and hundreds of dollars traveling to visit their families back home, Darryl Robinson (COL ’15) lives only a 10-minute bus ride away.
“It feels like every day, when I get up, I’m not at Georgetown,” Robinson said. “I don’t feel like anything has changed since I’ve lived in my room at home.”
Robinson, who applied to Georgetown as a neurobiology major and hopes to transfer to the School of Nursing and Health Studies, graduated from César Chávez Public Charter High School for Public Policy in Ward 7.
Although Georgetown became his top choice once he had researched his options, Robinson had never even heard of the university before his junior year of high school.
As the D.C. public school system struggles with a graduation rate hovering around 50 percent and massive achievement gaps among students in underserved neighborhoods, attending college is a distant dream for some of its students.
A STUDENT’S PERSPECTIVE
After having friends and teachers encourage him to apply to Georgetown, Robinson attended information sessions offered by the Ward 7 Initiative, a program that links current undergraduate students with prospective students from D.C. high schools.
To his knowledge, Robinson is the first student to be accepted to Georgetown from his high school.
While there are few other students from D.C. in the freshman class, he has enjoyed meeting other locals, including students from the first graduating class of Don Bosco Cristo Rey High School, which focuses on serving low-income students. The school is located in Takoma Park, Md., but affiliated with the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C.
Jessica Palencia (COL ’15) is one of three Don Bosco alums at Georgetown.
Palencia had grown familiar with the Georgetown campus long before she arrived in the fall through Don Bosco’s Corporate Work Study Program, which helps high school students to gain professional work experience and earn money to pay for a portion of their education. Palencia is now in her fourth year working for the Office of the University President.
Though she initially didn’t want to attend college close to home, Palencia still thinks she’s getting the full college experience.
“I don’t feel like I’m being deprived of anything,” she said. “I’m getting to explore the city and learn things about it that I never knew before, like social justice issues.”
She said she’s thankful to be close to the support systems that she grew up with.
“I think it’s the fact that my school is Cristo Rey that I have so many close relationships and connections.”
Robinson, who tries to see his family about every other week, acknowledged that he sometimes feels slightly too close to home, especially when his two younger sisters pressure him to spend time with them.
“They are always texting me and calling me, trying to go out, trying to make me go back home, [even] when I have to study for a test,” he said.
At times, Robinson feels like he never left home, but in other ways, his life at Georgetown has been a complete change from the environment he was used to.
“I was never in a situation where the majority of people around me cared about going to classes as much as Georgetown students,” he said. “But just to see that everyone has the same mindset, they want to succeed in life and they’re not willing to let things go in the hands of fate, it’s amazing to me.”
STUDENTS REACH OUT
Georgetown students have launched several mentoring and tutoring programs that work with the most underserved communities in D.C., aiming to expose students to college and the importance of higher education.
The Meyers Institute for College Prep, which is run by the university’s Center for Multicultural Equity and Access, works with local middle and high school students to help prepare them for college.
Each Saturday morning, MICP holds classes on Georgetown’s campus for students from a variety of at-risk schools to immerse them in a collegiate atmosphere.
“We bring Georgetown to the community and present it as a rich, vibrant campus that is a home within a home,” Executive Director of the MICP Charlene Brown-McKenzie (COL ’95) said.
Since the MICP was founded in 1989, six of its students have come to Georgetown as undergraduates and successfully graduated within four to five years, according to Brown-McKenzie.
The Georgetown University Math & Science Hands-On Enrichment program, one of several student organizations at work in Wards 7 and 8, stresses the importance of college to its participants.
Angiela Sivakumar (COL ’13), secretary of GUMSHOE, said having members of the university engage with the community makes college seem like a more tangible option.
“Students are able to interact with undergraduates and get a sense of what college is like,” she said.
Strive for College, a national organization that recently launched a chapter at Georgetown, pairs college students with students from disadvantaged high schools to help them navigate the college application process.
“Many low-income students are completely qualified to go to college but don’t have the resources or support to go through the application process,” Brigid McCurdy (COL ’14), director of public relations, marketing and fundraising, wrote in an email.
RECRUITING FROM WITHIN
Through its admissions process, the university has several programs to address the underrepresentation of D.C. residents on campus.
Kamilah Holder is senior assistant director of undergraduate admissions and coordinator of African-American recruitment. She also heads recruitment efforts for D.C. and serves as the first point of contact for local students learning about Georgetown.
“It’s really important that we are representative … of the world, and we wouldn’t be an accurate picture if we did not have students that represented the variety of different backgrounds and perspectives that come with being a native Washingtonian,” Holder said.
Holder said that there is great diversity in the types of students from D.C. due to the District’s diverse array of school systems — public and private, charter and independent. The university has longstanding relationships with some schools in the city and is forming new ties with others.
“John Carroll faces outward to D.C. … Our connection to D.C. and having D.C. students be a part of that community is very important,” she said. “We aren’t Georgetown without D.C.”

By pairing undergraduate students with faculty members to conduct innovative research projects, the growing Georgetown Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program aims to take students beyond textbook learning.
“Working in the lab helps me apply many of the techniques I learned in class,” Mathew Hoffmann (COL ’14), who is researching methanol fuel cells, said. “We’re working with alternative energy sources and breaking new ground. It’s very exciting to be a part of something so important and so new.”
The program, founded in 1966, helps professors to mentor students.
“The best thing about our program is the strong student-faculty relationships that develop,” GUROP Director Sonia Jacobson, who helped found the program, said. “Research often occurs over the course of more than one semester, which gives students an incredible opportunity to develop and learn through first-hand work.”
This semester, 170 students are conducting research through GUROP, which is now housed under the Georgetown Office of Fellowships, Awards and Research. About half of these undergraduates are biology, chemistry or physics majors, while the other half are social science majors.
For upperclassmen, involvement in GUROP also has practical benefits. Research experience is especially valuable in the current job market, according to Lauren Tuckley, the research resource coordinator in GOFAR
“It’s a vital asset to have research experience that supplements your coursework,” Tuckley said. “The skill set acquired from participating in scholarly research is invaluable in the marketplace.”
While GUROP provides valuable research experience for undergraduate students, both Jacobson and Tuckley believe that its full potential has not yet been realized. The pair is currently developing a new, searchable database that will streamline the application process.
GOFAR is also implementing a new outreach group, the Undergraduate Research Ambassadors, to stimulate interest in research and to increase the program’s visibility on campus.
“We are trying to get students to consider careers that they would not have considered otherwise,” Jacobson said. “Instead of moving on to the State Department or medical school, some students become convinced that pursuing a Ph.D and performing research is a more suitable career.”
Tyler White (COL ’14), a psychology major working in the Georgetown Autism and Communication Disorders Clinic, came to such a conclusion after conducting research through GUROP.
“For the past few months, as I have been reading through dozens of clinical reports, I’ve been paging through documents that profoundly reflect and affect people’s lives,” he said. “Playing a hand in the development of scientific knowledge is something I would love to spend the rest of my life doing.”

The presidents of College Democrats and College Republicans will meet with administrators, the Student Activities Commission and GUSA today to resolve a debate about funding for student groups to attend political conventions.
The issue was first raised when College Republicans requested money from the Georgetown University Student Association Fund to attend last week’s Conservative Political Action Conference in D.C. The club applied for funding from GUSA after SAC refused to cover the event registration fees, according to club Chair Maggie Cleary (COL ’14).
However, after the request was approved by GUSA, Cleary received an email from SAC Chair Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14) explaining that SAC could neither authorize the organization to spend the money nor provide permission to attend the conference as a representative of Georgetown University.
“The commission considered it, and then we deferred to university officials and the [Office of] University Counsel,” Appelbaum said. “Based on their interpretation and judgment of the policy, we asserted that it would be a violation of the policy and the commission couldn’t authorize them to go.”
Georgetown operates as a tax-exempt institution under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, which prohibits the university from engaging in or supporting any partisan political activity.
The Conservation Political Action Conference, or CPAC, was organized by the American Conservation Union Foundation, which aims to promote conservative education and is also registered under Section 501(c)(3).
“Read the headlines on [the CPAC] website,” Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming said, justifying the university’s decision. “I would suspect anybody looking at the headlines that came out of this conference could have left with the impression that it was partisan political activity.”
Cleary, however, disagreed that the fees would fund a partisan political committee or candidates.
“The money for registration fees was going to the American Conservative Union that runs CPAC every year,” she said.
According to Appelbaum, the rule has been applied evenly to both College Democrats and College Republicans.
“I know one of the things that the university administrators did was to look back in history to see what SAC has funded, and they couldn’t find any other evidence of funding for an event of this nature that passed,” he said.
The College Democrats have not received funding to go to national conferences in recent years, but would like to attend the College Democrats of America annual conference this year, according to club Chair Joseph Vandegriff (COL ’14).
Several members of the College Republicans ultimately decided to register for the conference as individuals unaffiliated with the university. Fleming said he supported the university’s decision to withhold funding for the event, but was pleased that the students chose to attend on their own.
“It is our goal, to the extent we can, to find a way for you to do what you want to do in your organizations … within the constraints of the law,” Fleming said. “My understanding is that it didn’t stop anybody from going to CPAC. I’m glad they got to do it and it didn’t dust up our tax-exempt status.”

The American flag comprised of Malkerson-Cleary campaign flyers on the Red Square wind tunnel wall was defaced early Saturday morning.
The words “U.S. WANTED FOR MURDER!” were spray-painted on the sign’s lower half, and another Malkerson-Cleary campaign banner hanging on the Intercultural Center was torn down.
“It’s not in the spirit of the campaign. … It’s quite disappointing,” Georgetown University Student Association presidential candidate Colton Malkerson (COL ’13) said.
Malkerson is unsure whether the target of the vandalism was his campaign or the symbolism of the American flag.
“[The flag] wasn’t meant to be a political statement,” he said. “It was meant to be eye-catching and get people’s attention. The fact that it was attacked in [this] manner makes no sense.”
The Department of Public Safety told Malkerson that he was required to take his vandalized flyers down or cover them. After placing the other campaign banner that had been torn over a portion of the vandalized flag, Malkerson filmed a video from in front of the wall and published it to his campaign’s YouTube channel.

Malkerson was told by the GUSA Election Commission that any repairs to the flag will not violate campaign laws limiting the number of flyers a candidate can post. Later Saturday morning, campaign members repaired the flag with sheets of plain colored paper. However, DPS removed the bannerSatruday night because some of the paper covering the vandalism came off, allowing the spray paint to show through again.
In the wake of the vandalism, Malkerson and his running mate, Maggie Cleary (COL ’14), have been approached by other tickets in sympathy.
“A few of the campaigns have reached out to us just to show support, which is appreciated,” he said.

Regents Hall, the university’s new science facility, is on track to be completed by May 2012, two months earlier than previously announced.
The building is slated to open for the next academic year with an official ceremony to celebrate staff and distinguished alumni closely involved in the project.
The new facility will offer more study and laboratory space for both undergraduate and graduate students, according to Ali Whitmer, an associate dean of Georgetown College. Instead of having separate spaces for the biology, chemistry and physics departments, faculty members from different areas will have interspersed offices in the hope of promoting interdisciplinary research.
In an effort to be ecologically friendly, the facility includes plans for new green space — a terrace running between the Hariri Building and Regents Hall that will incorporate water capture and reuse technology.
“We will have what we are referring to as a new quad, which will be an open space with plants and lawn,” Whitmer said.
Sustainability is also incorporated into Regents Hall’s interior design and its heating and cooling system.
“We have included in all elements of construction, design and finishes what we all would call green building practices,” Whitmer said. “The way the windows were designed and the orientation of spaces was planned to take advantage of natural light rather than using electrical lighting.”
The cost of the $93 million LEED-certified building was defrayed by a $6.9 million grant from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The grant was awarded as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 in part because the university employed 750 people during the building’s construction and created 28 permanent positions during an economic recession.
Regents Hall was partially funded by the Board of Regents, the board of alumni advisers for whom the building was named.
“The building was named in their honor in recognition of the philanthropy and service they have provided to Georgetown as an entire institution. It is at such a high level that we wanted to honor them in a big way, and this was a way that we could do that,” Whitmer said.

The university has expanded the scope of its Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility to consider investment proposals written by members of the university community.
It also plans to broaden the constituency of the committee by the fall, according to a university statement released Friday. Proposals endorsed by the committee, which makes recommendations on socially responsible options in which to invest parts of the university’s endowment, go to the finance committee of the board of directors.
“Our Catholic and Jesuit mission compels us to help ensure our investments are consistent with our basic values,” Rev. John Langan, S.J., a member of the CISR working group and a professor in the philosophy department, the Kennedy School of Ethics and the School of Foreign Service, said in the release. “The committee will allow for an important extra layer of consideration in these matters.”
The changes to the CISR grew out of discussions between the Georgetown faculty, senior university officials and the Faculty Senate, who examined Georgetown’s current socially responsible investment policies and those of about 30 peer institutions.
The modifications were approved by the board of directors last week.
The CISR was founded in the 1970s and is currently comprised of 12 representatives. These include faculty members, administrators and students appointed by the Vice President for Student Affairs and the undergraduate, graduate and Law Center student associations.
“The committee reflects Georgetown’s identity as well as the university’s dedication to fostering open dialogue and celebrating a diversity of perspectives,” Chief Investment Officer Mike Barry said in the university statement.
