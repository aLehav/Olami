Spencer Woodall (MSB, SFS ’24) and Anya Caraiani (SFS ’24), who are running for Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) president and vice president, said they have built their platform around reframing GUSA’s budget to better serve students, combating food insecurity on campus and improving accessibility for disabled students.
The Hoya sat down with Woodall, who currently serves as GUSA vice speaker of the senate, and Caraiani to discuss their campaign goals and how they plan to achieve them. Voting opens Nov. 10 and closes Nov. 12.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
If elected, what are your top priorities?
Woodall: We need to understand what we can do as members of GUSA. GUSA has its own budget of about $20,000 a year, and the biggest thing I have been a proponent of in this campaign is making sure that we spend that money responsibly because that’s $20,000, and we could be putting that money to other student organizations if we have extra room. I want to put this money into the Student Advocacy Office, because I’ve talked to some members of the student advocacy board and they said they’re pretty underfunded by GUSA. 
Caraiani: One of the other main things we want to focus on is increasing accessibility on campus for disabled students. That’s a problem we’ve recognized. It’s a pretty stark problem in our community, and we want to make sure that everyone’s voice is heard and that we’re able to represent that voice adequately to the Georgetown administration.
How do you plan to facilitate interactions between the student body and GUSA?
Woodall: You get a transparent GUSA by making sure you elect transparent leaders. My opponents have a very bad history of injecting their politics — not necessarily their political views, but their politics as far as getting elected and reelected for GUSA and how they’ll look with the main campus. I don’t care what’s going to happen, what’s going to hurt me in an election. What I want to do is I want to make sure I’m best representing the needs of the student body and I’m helping them have the best experience on campus possible. I feel like we bring a very interesting take to the table, because you know that we’re not a completely political ticket. 
Caraiani: Because I’m an outsider to GUSA, I have no vested interest in these power dynamics within GUSA. I don’t really know so much, I haven’t been there for the past year, so I can kind of provide a fresh perspective that isn’t so power-politics centered.
What experiences do you have that qualify you for this position?
Caraiani: I’m a club leader right now. I am the president of Prospect Records, which is a media board club. I’m basically managing day-to-day things, especially focusing on budget, and also just managing so many operations on a day-to-day basis, which would transfer over to GUSA, especially for us because we are so budget focused. Additionally, I’ve worked in a legislator’s office, and I’ve worked for a consulting firm.
Woodall: As Vice Speaker I’ve been in charge of a lot of leadership and I was in charge of creating the handbook for the key actors, which is basically getting the right names of administrators and getting their contact info so that senators know who to contact. I have almost a year of senate experience now, so I’m very well versed in how this all works and I’m more than capable of taking on the job.
How do you believe you will be able to accomplish the goals you set during your term?
Woodall: The good thing about our platform is that we don’t need a lot of help from administration to get a lot of our plans done. I’ve made specific plans about what we should do with our deficit budget, I have specific areas that I’ve mentioned where we can cut, and that’s one thing we can definitely do. That’s something that GUSA has complete autonomy of. Another thing I plan on doing is addressing food insecurity on campus and I feel like there’s a very easy way to do this that would not involve the administration. One of the ways is that we can work with one of the food security clubs on campus, and we can create a program where students can voluntarily share extra meals which they might have and share that with students that have food insecurity. Because it’s a completely voluntary program, that’s something we won’t have any problem dealing with the administration.
Caraiani: Just to add on to that, with the new housing concerns, next year a lot of students will be displaced from campus. Along with that comes a lesser meal plan or perhaps not so many swipes, and with that comes potentially food insecurity for people that can’t afford to get Uber Eats or to get groceries every single week. So Spencer’s plan would really help with that as well.
Why should voters support your ticket?
Caraiani: We’re the transparency ticket. Everything that we pledged to do is feasible to do within GUSA. We’re going to put effective plans into action. Most importantly of that is budget concerns because we can do so much with this extra money that’s just sitting there. We’re really a frugal ticket and it’s not about us. It’s about what we can do for the student body.
Woodall: We’re the only ticket that has an actual clear platform. What we need to do is we need to build our transparency and build better trust with the student body. You get that through having transparent leaders that have a history of not inflicting their own political success on how they vote, making sure people know exactly what they’re getting. What students should know is that we are the most transparent ticket and they should feel confident to communicate with us in any way. The goal here is simply to make our lives as hard as possible to make the lives of other students as easy as possible.

Camber Vincent (SFS ’24) and Alyssa Hirai (SFS ’24), who are running for Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) president and vice president, said they have built their platform around institutional experience, ongoing advocacy projects and established connections to administration and student groups. 
The Hoya sat down with Vincent, who currently serves as GUSA speaker of the senate, and Hirai, at-large GUSA senator and chair of policy and advocacy, to discuss their campaign goals and how they plan to achieve them. Voting opens Nov. 10 and closes Nov. 12.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
If elected, what will your top priorities be?
Vincent: We want to continue the work that we’ve already started to get back together. We’ve lost a lot of institutional resources over the years because of lackluster administrations, COVID-19 responses and all of these problems of being online. We’ve just started to get back a lot of channels of advocacy and communications — we just got back the GUSA newsletter, we are currently working on the GUSA website. We want to keep this trend towards more engagement with the student body, more engagement with the community and make sure that we’re actually there to provide answers to questions. 
Hirai: One of my long-term projects is improving our meal plan, especially for upperclassmen — reducing the meal plan. These are all projects that affect every student on campus. These are issues that disproportionately affect first-generation, low-income students. That was one of my reasons for joining GUSA in the first place, and that advocacy is what I want to continue if I’m elected.
How do you plan to facilitate interactions between the student body and GUSA?
Vincent: Students have a lot of questions about a lot of different things that impact their lives — we have the answers to these questions. In order to actually communicate those answers, what we’re going to start doing and what we’ve already begun to work on with the website that we’re building out, is making these briefing documents — one-page documents whenever there’s a relevant update that explains the rationale behind the university administrators’ decisions and answers frequently asked questions. 
Hirai: We also already have a working relationship with key actors in the administration. A lot of it is going to be continuation and ramping up the projects that we already have, and the GUSA website and the newsletter are big ones.
What experience do you have that qualifies you for this position?
Hirai: A lot of my advocacy in GUSA has come from my experience being a first-generation, low-income student. The Georgetown Scholars Program (GSP) has been a really big part of my college life and that’s the reason I joined GUSA — to give back and to represent students disproportionately affected by various issues on campus, whether it be housing or the meal plan, or lack of transportation access. We’ve talked a lot about how we can advocate for GSP but I think having those lived experiences and connections with people also part of that community would definitely help.
Vincent: For me, it’s more about institutional experience. I have been in the senate for about two years now. The other two presidential tickets have been in the senate for about a year now. Of the three, I’m the only one who has actually taken steps to achieve various platforms and various indications of success. I’m the only one who’s actually met with administrators. I think that my experience, my connections with administrators, my knowledge of connections with various groups on this campus that are important for advocacy and platforming them, is something that would really help me be a successful executive ticket here is just ongoing relationship with the administration that other students have not built despite having the same opportunity to do so during our time in the senate. 
How do you believe you will be able to accomplish the goals you set during your term?
Hirai: Camber and I have been working with various faculty members and we have ongoing projects that I think we’ve made a lot of progress on in the past year. It’s also about knowing what projects are actually feasible. I think a lot of students feel frustrated because when people campaign for GUSA, they always have a list of things that would be great if it could happen but we all know that it’s literally impossible. We have the knowledge to figure out what projects we actually can get done and really lean into those ones.
Vincent: I think the two things that distinctly make or break whether we’re able to achieve our goals is first a willingness to put in the work. You are spending a huge amount of your time doing unpaid and unrecognized work that the university administration should be doing. At the end of the day, I am the only candidate in the field that has committed the time to actually do that. There’s also something to be said for structural continuity. One of the things that GUSA struggles with is that a lot of projects are long term — they take four, five, six years to complete advocacy on. Students are only here for four years, so ensuring that your projects actually get passed down is something that’s important.
Why should voters support your ticket?
Vincent: Voters should support our ticket because we are the only candidates with qualified experience who know what we’re doing. We’re the only ones who know what feasibly can and can’t be done and we’re the only ones with working relationships with administrators. And without those three key aspects, you’re going to have a failed administration that doesn’t know what they’re doing.
Hirai: This sounds like a very low bar, but Camber and I share a common interest in having a functional student government and I think that’s what students are just so frustrated with. No one cares about dumb politics in GUSA. I think our ticket represents the average Georgetown student the best, and also various affinity groups and traditionally more vulnerable and underrepresented communities on campus.

Chijioke Achebe (SFS ’25) and Devon Pasieka (MSB ’25), who are running for Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) president and vice president, said they have built their platform around increasing accessibility, working to utilize their networks across campus and connections with administration officials.
The Hoya sat down with current GUSA Senator Achebe and GUSA’s current Executive Crisis Response Director Paseika to discuss their campaign goals and how they plan to achieve them. Voting opens Nov. 10 and closes Nov. 12.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
If elected, what are your top priorities?
Achebe: We want to make GUSA more accessible. I’m in the senate and Devon is in the executive, but we do have different networks and connections that just aren’t that little GUSA bubble that exists. We know more people than that around this campus and we want to make us more accessible to those people who aren’t really involved in it at all. This work is vitally important, but a lot of people in GUSA take themselves way too seriously. I’m just a college kid who wants to help my classmates have a better, fairer, safer college experience. We need to make it more accessible and more responsive to students. That’s my primary goal.
Pasieka: I think making GUSA more accessible starts with going back to our roots. GUSA’s goal should ultimately be making the student experience better. It should be allowing students to make a greater impact at Georgetown themselves. And I think right now, Georgetown hinders that. There are so many different methods of communication that come in, and we don’t have a common network that shares every day what is going on at Georgetown. If we’re the undergraduate student association, we should be helping our students take advantage of Georgetown. So I think if elected, my first priority is to look out for people who feel super overwhelmed and out of touch and not knowing where to get their information to have GUSA be that center.
How do you plan to facilitate interactions between the student body and GUSA?
Achebe: GUSA itself is quite insular, but Devon and I do a lot of different things with a lot of different people on campus. We know a lot of people on this campus and that’s the first step. You want people who you see around and can just walk up to them and speak with them. There’s a lot of internal reform I think GUSA can undergo to make the body itself more transparent and more accessible, but I think the first step is having an executive that you know and recognize and see around campus.
Pasieka: I’m so lucky to be a part of so many awesome groups on campus, and those groups are why I’m running because of the concerns that I’ve seen from those groups. GUSA has been a great learning experience to see how things get done and where they kind of reach a hard stop. But truly, it’s those groups and the people that I’ve met here and wanting to be involved on campus because I want to give back to Georgetown because I see that there’s room for improvement here: I’ve learned that through the network that I’ve had from the involvement I’ve had at Georgetown. Those people are definitely who I’m running for.
What experiences do you have that qualify you for this position?
Achebe: I am in the senate and I am the vice chair of the finance and appropriations committee, which I think is the most important committee within GUSA. We take the student activities fund and allocate it to the clubs on campus. Outside of that, I’m in the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union and Georgetown University Student Investment Fund. Knowing all these people, hearing their stories, their experiences, what makes them tick and what’s important to all of these groups of people I think makes me the ideal candidate. 
Pasieka: I hold leadership positions on TEDx Georgetown and I hold a board position in Georgetown Student Capital Partners. And it has been great to watch both of those clubs grow, and having that experience definitely gave me a new insight into how an organization should be picked apart and analyzed to make it run more efficiently. GUSA allows me to be creative and think of ways to alter and improve the student experience is really fulfilling.
How do you believe you will be able to accomplish the goals you set during your term?
Achebe: I’ve been able to build relationships with members of the administration in GUSA, so that’s where it starts. I think knowing that we have those lines of communication is how it starts. Not just having talked to students a lot, but also the administrators, because we derive our power from them. I know that we have those relationships in place already so that day one we can get to work for Georgetown students.
Pasieka: I want to start, on day one, collecting every single event that’s going on at Georgetown that day. I want that to be a legacy of ours that no Georgetown student can feel like they’re out of touch. That’s one thing that’s super tangible that we can do. I also think the most important thing to do is create a GUSA working group with our maintenance team and our Leo’s team, because they work really hard for us and are severely understaffed. We need to make sure that, as a part of the Georgetown community, we understand their needs too, because as much as we’re serving the undergraduate students, they’re also serving us. 
Why should voters support your ticket?
Achebe: We have experiences both inside and outside GUSA, so we’re not insular at all. We know we do different things around here besides just sitting and talking about resolutions that don’t really mean a whole lot. People have seen us and know we’re gonna fight for them. They know that we have their priorities front and center. They know that we care and so that’s why they should support us. 
Pasieka: We’re unique. We want to give back to the Georgetown community. There’s nothing that is a personal gain, but we’ve both had some great opportunities that we want to share and we want to make sure that the student experience is a shared positive one, especially coming back from so many years of just disconnectedness.
