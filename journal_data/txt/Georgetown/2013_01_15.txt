Approximately 560 students took time away from winter break relaxation to network with Georgetown alumni at the Georgetown University Alumni Association Career Services and Cawley Career Center’s seventh Winter Break Career Tour from Jan. 2 to 4.
The events partnered university clubs, such as the 1634 Society, with alumni clubs in 13 cities including Los Angeles, Boston, New York and Washington, D.C. Tampa, Seattle and Dallas-Fort Worth were added as new locations this year.
“[Location] is based on who has the capacity and who thinks that they can actually find alumni and students to get together over break,” Assistant Director of Career Services Sarah Hay said.
While planning was generally centralized around Career Services, each club planned its own distinct format.
“People mainly decide to either have an open networking reception or a speaker or a panelist and an open networking section, so everyone had a different format,” Hay said.
Scott Goldstein (SFS ’16) was disappointed by the set-up of the event he attended in Washington, D.C.
“I think they could have organized it better, at least in D.C. where it was organized in a round-robin kind of way,” Goldstein said. “I wish they could have told us what people were working there and given us more personal autonomy to go to the tables we saw suited us.”
Alumni selection also differed between cities, but Hay speculated that there were approximately 20 to 30 alumni at each event.
Most students who attended were sophomores and juniors.
“Juniors were definitely more eager to talk to [the alums] afterward, but the event helps get people in the mindset,” 1634 Society member and New York Career Fair Volunteer Bailey Holtz (COL ’14) said.
Hay agreed that the events were most relevant to juniors.
“It’s probably for people who are beginning the job-hunting process,” Hay said. “I think it’s something that people really enjoy because it gives students the chance to participate with the university while they’re over break, but it can also be a challenge because some people are travelling.”
Holtz noted the connection between Georgetown students and alumni that draws both groups to these fairs..
“I know that Hoyas like to hire students from Georgetown, which is nice to hear,” Holtz said.
Goldstein, who had hoped to learn about the Foreign Service but ended up spending most of his time talking to alumni involved in marketing, thought that the event in D.C. could have provided more in-depth information about specific industries.
“A bit more breadth would have been good, but you didn’t get that because you just had to follow your group around,” he said.
Lily Ham (COL ’16) attended the event in Boston and used the event as a learning opportunity rather than a networking effort.
“I think it was more educational,” Ham said. “Older students would have gotten something out of it, but I think even just for me, just going there and seeing what people were doing in their profession was nice.”
Hay agreed, emphasizing that the events were not actual career fairs.
“I think it is really more to educate,” Hay said. “You’ll get a couple cities that say that they have an alum who is looking to hire, but we really try to say up front that this is not a career fair. But you do certainly gain contacts.”
Even without the pressure to find a job, Ham found the experience and advice reassuring.
“It was really nice to see that everyone who is in their specific field didn’t start off knowing what they wanted to do, and for me that’s where I am,” Ham said. “They gave us tips on how that helped them in interviewing, how it helped them to stand out and how you can put all of your different experiences together toward what you want to do.”

Georgetown conferred an honorary degree on Ambassador Alfred Moses (LAW ’56) in Gaston Hall Monday, naming him a Doctor of Humane Letters.
Moses worked for 13 years as an advocate for the rights of Jews to freely emigrate from Romania. Georgetown bestowed the honorary degree on Moses for his service as an attorney and for his contributions to human rights efforts around the globe. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi attended the event.
“In my four plus decades of collaboration with Al, he has always distinguished himself in balancing conviction, commitment to causes and passion on one hand with reason, core values and common sense on the other hand,” Chairman of Georgetown’s Board of Directors Paul Tagliabue (C ’62), who is a colleague of Moses’ at Covington & Burling, LLP said. “Al has never forgotten his roots in his own community while helping others over many decades to secure a place in their own communities.”
Moses has served in both the Carter and Clinton administrations. He was special adviser and special counsel to President Jimmy Carter, and during the Clinton administration, he served as the U.S. ambassador to Romania from 1994 to 1997 and special presidential emissary for the Cyprus Conflict from 1999 to 2001.
William Trainor, Georgetown’s executive vice president and dean of the Law Center, read Moses’ degree citation. Trainor noted Moses’ devotion to equality in his law and public service efforts.
“As much as his work has been characterized by engagement with our world, it has also been grounded in deep thought, academic training and intellectual integrity,” Trainor said. “His success in the private sector is matched and even surpassed by his accomplishments as a public servant, diplomat and human rights advocate.”
After the citation reading, University President John J. DeGioia officially conferred the honorary degree on Moses. Moses then spoke about his experiences in Romania and his vision for the future.
“It’s true that in the 1970s, I went behind the Iron Curtain,” Moses said. “It was the great divide. … It was a land of eternal darkness.”
Despite this hostile environment, Moses fought on behalf of Jewish citizens of Romania. The Jewish community in Romania was widely persecuted by the government. Moses said his decision to help was instinctive.
“It’s true: All of us have the opportunity at one time or another to free the oppressed,” he said. “That’s not an option — it’s obligatory.”
Moses said he believes that success comes from the desire for equality in the future.
“Certainly, we are all aware that the world is changing, ever thus,” he said. “For my generation, we’re rounding the bend on the river of time, but we all have an obligation to look ahead not behind.”
Despite many current global problems, Moses said he believes that for most people, the world is a better place now than it was when he first started as a political advocate. Moses spoke of great hope for future generations and commended Georgetown as an institution of higher learning.
“So, what of the future? I have enormous confidence in the future of our country and our leaders will come from the likes of Georgetown that not only survives for two hundred years but flourishes as a citadel of liberal learning, which searches for truth in the Jesuit tradition,” he said. “Georgetown remembers the oppressed and the needy and that’s fulfilling the highest obligation that we share as human beings.”
Event attendees, many of whom were Moses’ colleagues, friends, family or members of the Georgetown community, said they were excited to share in the bestowing of Moses’ honorary degree.
“The award is certainly well-deserved,” said Tom Williamson, President of the D.C. Bar and Moses’ colleague at Covington & Burling, LLP. “I think Al has fulfilled the highest ideals of the profession both because he has been extraordinarily effective in representing others as a lawyer but, more importantly, he has really taken those skills into the public and international sphere and used them to really benefit and advance the interests of the thousands of others who otherwise would have suffered or been denied rights.”

While Georgetown students often imagine exotic, international careers in the foreign service, many are confused by the complicated and competitive application process. U.S. State Department Director General Linda Thomas-Greenfield clarified misconceptions about Foreign Service careers in a lecture about her own experience Friday afternoon.
The event, which was co-sponsored by the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy and the Walsh School of Foreign Service Graduate Career Development Center, gave students the opportunity to ask questions about the foreign service application process and employment specifics.
The event, which was originally supposed to be held in a conference room, was moved to the Intercultural Center Auditorium to accommodate the unexpected level of student interest.
Thomas-Greenfield, the current State Department director of human resources, began working for the foreign service in 1982, serving in Jamaica, Nigeria, The Gambia, Kenya, Pakistan and Switzerland. Most recently, she was the ambassador to the Republic of Liberia from 2008 to 2012.
Thomas-Greenfield discussed her non-traditional career path and her search to find a fulfilling career, saying she dabbled in academia, teaching and research before eventually joining the foreign service on a whim.
She encouraged students to pursue meaningful careers that interest them and suggested that students explore the unfamiliar and push themselves to adapt in difficult situations.
“I have personally benefitted from venturing outside of my comfort zone,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “Do something that is outside of your comfort zone, because it may lead you to a career path that can be rewarding.”
Thomas-Greenfield also discussed the importance of perseverance and self-confidence. She was told that if she continued to do only refugee work, she would never make it. About these naysayers, Thomas-Greenfield said, “They were wrong.”
Regarding rejection from the Foreign Service application process, she encouraged students to continue applying and taking the Foreign Service exam until they succeeded.
“You should see it as a campaign — most people don’t pass it the first time,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “If this is something you want to do, don’t give up on it.”
Amy Soderquist (GRD ’14) found Thomas-Greenfield’s advice practical.
“I’ve taken the foreign service exam before, and I didn’t get the job,” Soderquist said. “This is the event to go to learn more. It taught me more about paying attention to the first part of the application process.”
Thomas-Greenfield noted the impressive legacy of Georgetown graduates within the foreign service. In a highly selective service of foreign service officers that numbers a little more than 15,000, 796 are Georgetown graduates, and 316 graduates work within the civil service sector. Since 2004, more than 600 Georgetown students have interned for the State Department, with 27 interning this fall alone.
Thomas-Greenfield emphasized that while the State Department seeks employees with various skills and backgrounds, employees must work well with others to be truly successful.
“If you go and stay for two years somewhere and you don’t have a friend in that country, you’re not doing your job,” she said.
She also addressed the difficulties and opportunities provided by a career that involves packing up every two years and moving to a completely new location.
“I relish it. It has been an amazing experience to reinvent every two to three years,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “However, our families represent the United States, too. Trying to instill American values in my children while abroad has been extremely challenging.”
Tucker Colvin (SFS ’15) found Thomas-Greenfield’s words inspiring.
“I’m personally interested in the foreign service, and I’m trying to hear as many personal perspectives as possible,” Colvin said. “Every time I go to one of these events, I get excited about working within the foreign service.”

The Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union opened a new ATM in the Edmund A. Walsh Building lobby, adding accessibility and convenience for credit union cardholders who live on East Campus.
GUASFCU CEO Nikhil Lakhanpal (MSB ’13) said he hoped this new ATM location would both increase GUASFCU’scampus presence and help students.
“[That area] is one part of campus where we didn’t really have a presence,” Lakhanpal said.
Before the installation, GUASFCU members often paid extra fees to use the nearby ATM at The Tombs rather than walking to the nearest GUASFCU ATM inO’Donovan Hall. The new ATM’s location across the street from The Tombs and Wisemiller’s, popular student eateries, adds to its convenience.
“A lot of our members are excited now that they won’t get charged at The Tombs because it’s too far to walk to Leo’s,” Lakhanpal said.
The installation of GUASFCU’s third company-owned ATM did not come without challenges.
“We’ve been trying to get this ATM for a while,” Lakhanpal said. “One of the things that hurts us the most is [employee] turnover. Each board of directors that comes in tries to get an ATM but has to start [their efforts] over as a new board.”
This year, however, Lakhanpal said that GUASFCU pushed the university harder to facilitate the addition of the ATM.
“[Deborah Morey], the new university services chief business officer, was very willing to work with us,”Lakhanpal said.
Lakhanpal praised Morey’s ability to empathize with student interests.
“She helped us get a whole contract that’s signed and worked with facilities to make sure there was a connection up and running,” Lakhanpal said. “[Things] are running pretty smooth from there.”
GUASFCU is also looking to adding more ATMs on campus, specifically one in Hoya Snaxa later this semester.
“We’re always looking to expand,” Lakhanpal said. “We’re really excited about putting one in HoyaSnaxa. It’s a nice partnership between GUASFCU and The Corp, and it’s a win-win for both companies.”
The Hoya Snaxa ATM’s tentative installation date is late February.

Washington, D.C. voters will cast their ballots on a proposed amendment to D.C.’s home rule charter that would give the D.C. Council direct control over the city’s budget April 23.
Currently, the District’s yearly budgets must be approved by Congress during the federal budget process, and supporters say that the passage of the referendum would be a significant step forward in the city’s quest for greater autonomy.
“Along with D.C. residents, I share the D.C. Council’s frustration at sending the city’s local budget to a Congress that has no part in raising the city’s local revenue,” Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), the District’s non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives, said in a press statement. “The denial of budget autonomy not only violates a basic tenant of self-government, it also imposes substantial operational and financial costs on the city,”
But the council’s push for increased autonomy could incite backlash in Congress, according to Norton.
“After being informed of the proposed charter amendment and investigating it, we briefed the mayor and council chairman on the legal and institutional issues and risks of a referendum that would allow the city to give itself budget autonomy,” Norton said in the statement. “In light of these issues and increasing Republican and Democratic support for budget autonomy, we will continue to work with our allies in the House and Senate to pass a budget autonomy bill.”
The referendum’s announcement comes just weeks after then-Senators Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) introduced a bill to the now-adjourned 112th Congress that would have granted D.C. statehood. Norton introduced a companion bill in the House of Representatives. The bills, however, were largely symbolic and were wiped from the Congressional docket when the 112th Congress ended on Jan. 3.
Although both bills put before the 112th Congress failed to pass, the upcoming referendum is the latest phase of a grassroots movement for D.C. home rule and eventual statehood that originated almost 40 years ago.
“I do support statehood for D.C. strongly,” Ron Lewis, chairman of Advisory Neighborhood Commission2E, which encompasses Georgetown, told The Hoya. “I think it’s time we have a say at the national level because we are U.S. citizens, we pay our taxes the same as anyone else, we serve our country the same as anyone else and we deserve representation as much as anyone else.”
As to how enhanced D.C. autonomy would affect the university, Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming said that the passage of the referendum and other proposed measures would be heralded as positive developments.
“With regard to the question of both budget autonomy and voting representation for D.C. in Congress, in both instances, the university is well-served if those changes can become law,” he said.  “Just like other citizens of the District of Columbia, we rely on the District government for a variety of services, [such as] police protection. The current situation, which requires the federal government — the Congress of the United States — to have to sign off on budgetary decisions by the government of the District of Columbia involving funds from taxpayers here, poses periodic risks for those services to be disrupted because of this cumbersome process.”

Georgetown University Law Center Professor Louis Michael Seidman ignited a media firestorm after writing an op-ed about the pitfalls of strict constitutional obedience for The New York Times published Dec. 30.
The article, called “Let’s Give Up on the Constitution,” has garnered at least 17 response articles and an article published Dec. 31 on news website The Daily Caller has generated 769 comments. Seidman, theCarmack Waterhouse Professor of Constitutional Law at the Georgetown University Law Center, has also appeared on Fox News and National Public Radio following the op-ed’s publication.
Seidman, who taught a seminar on the Fourteenth Amendment at the Law Center last semester, said that he was amazed by the vocal reaction his piece has received.
“I did not expect to get over a thousand emails,” he said. “I’m surprised and delighted that people are paying attention to it. I hope it’s caused at least some people to think about a problem that’s not much discussed.”
In particular, the op-ed discusses the consequences of following what Seidman calls “archaic, idiosyncratic and downright evil provisions.”
Seidman said that although there are some tenets of the Constitution such as equality and liberty that are generally accepted, they do not help solve any of the contentious issues the United States faces today, including gay marriage and abortion.
“There are much more specific provisions in the Constitution that settle disputes but there the question is why we ought to be bound by a settlement that was annunciated by people who lived several centuries ago and who don’t know anything about the way our country functions now,” he said. “It just doesn’t seem like it makes any sense to use their preferences as a basis for running our country.”
Seidman emphasized that the criticisms in his op-ed are not confined to a particular political party.
“People on the right and the left ought to stop telling Americans that this is what you have to think because somebody said you had to think this 200 years ago,” he said. “We as a people have a right to decide for ourselves what we think about issues like gay marriage and affirmative action.”
According to Seidman, shifting the country’s adherence to the Constitution requires looking beyond the law itself.
“What’s needed is not so much a change in statute but a change in our culture,” he said. “[What we need to say is] maybe it is unconstitutional. So what? Why can’t we talk about the merits of this instead of what people thought about it 200 years ago?”
But Seidman admitted that concerns about the Constitution are multi-faceted.
“This is a complicated question and there’s more than one side to it,” he said.

While the eviction of Jack’s Canoes & Kayaks, LLC is temporarily on hold, the fate of the neighborhood institution, popular among Georgetown students, is still up in the air.
The boat rental and storage company, better known as Jack’s Boathouse, will remain in its location on 3500 Water St. NW pending further review, according to a Dec. 24 announcement by National Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis.
“We are in the crosshairs because of our success, but we’re not going anywhere,” Paul Simkin, the current owner of the boathouse, said.
The announcement came less than a week after the company received formal notification that it had until Jan. 31 to leave its storefront.
According to NPS officials, Jack’s Boathouse received the eviction notice because the name of the store’s previous owner and founder, Jack Baxter, was on the lease instead of that of Simkin, who assumed full ownership in 2009.
The stay of eviction announcement came after widespread public backlash. Jesse Rauch, executive director of the D.C. State Board of Education, spearheaded a campaign to save the boathouse from eviction. Rauch has garnered 2,265 signatures thus far in a petition to stop the eviction.
According to the petition, Jack’s Boathouse, despite being promised a three-year lease, was notified of its impending eviction after certain waterfront properties in Georgetown were transferred from the jurisdiction of the District of Columbia to that of NPS.
As first reported in The Washington Post, NPS wants the boathouse to operate on a concession contract, which reserves a portion of the boathouse’s profits for NPS funding. As of press time, spokespeople for NPS were not prepared to provide comment.
Simkin praised the online petition and other community efforts to support the boathouse, which employs about 15 Georgetown students and alumni.
“The grassroots efforts really kicked in and really made a difference and is making the process more transparent,” he said. “The best thing [supporters] can do is [visit] change.org, because I know the right people are reading that.”
The strong showing of local support has boosted Simkin’s confidence in the boathouse’s future.
“The boathouse is more important to folks than I ever thought,” he said.
Simkin added that Ward 2 Councilmember Jack Evans said he believes the city is behind the boathouse and recommended that Simkin hire an attorney to fight NPS. Evans could not be reached for immediate comment.
“His words were, ‘You are going to open and you are going to stay open. The National Park Service doesn’t have a leg to stand on,’” Simkin said.

When Dane Shikman (SFS ’13) became conferences coordinator for Georgetown’s Model United Nations Team this fall, he was determined to break tradition and put community over competition.
“I shifted the vision away to be more inclusive — to say Model UN is about more than winning, it’s about building a community of people that feel like they’re connected to something very valuable and meaningful,” Shikman said.
Conference judges evaluate Model UN teams partly based on the number of delegates on each team, with fewer delegates increasing a team’s odds of winning. While former Georgetown conferences coordinators focused on choosing a lower number of delegates to boost their chances of winning,Shikman refused to do so.
“There’s something different about Georgetown and it’s not just because we do Model UN well, because we clearly do, but that’s not something that keeps us [at] number one,” he said. “It’s the Georgetown spirit. It’s something unique about the energy we bring to a conference.”
Even with the odds against them, the Georgetown Model UN team, which brought 44 students to a recent conference — a large jump from the usual 15 — was ranked as the top Model UN program in North America this fall by Best Delegate, an organization regarded as the national authority on Model UN rankings.
The Best Delegate rankings are based on the competitiveness of the conferences that teams have participated in, the awards they have won and how many people competed on the team at each conference.
While Georgetown was also ranked number one last year, the team faced obstacles in retaining their leading position. According to Director of Public Relations Andrea Cohen (SFS ’15), the achievement stemmed from the hard work of all 75 team members.
“The competition this year seemed … tougher than last year,” she said. “That’s going to be what we’re going to have to keep fighting against this semester.”
Cohen singled out the members new to the team this year as being pivotal to the ranking.
“We have amazing freshmen and new people [in] the Model UN class, and that’s really important because those are the people that can sometimes determine awards,” she said. “I think that’s one of the things that put us ahead in rankings.”
The first-place ranking this year surprised Shikman because, in addition to its increased size, the team was awarded second place at two conferences this season.
“We didn’t know if we would be number one,” he said. “I didn’t expect Best Delegate to weight team size like I thought they should.”
Beyond the glint and gleam of its awards and recognition, members of the Model UN team are enthusiastic about the committee topics and countries that they represent.
“The goal is to solve world issues. We go for the love of diplomacy,” said Director of Operations JeffreyCaso (SFS ’15)..
In addition to discussing international policy, conference delegates have the chance to meet students from other colleges.
“You really get to know a lot of people from different universities, which is one of my favorite parts of Model UN,” Cohen said.
Students that participate in Model UN bring Georgetown traditions to the conferences that they attend.
“At the end of every conference, whether we win or lose, the Georgetown team stands on our chairs in the big assembly hall and sings the fight song before we leave,” Caso said. “We’re growing and we’re bringing the Georgetown name.”

The university has cut its contract with Adidas one year after the sportswear company was accused of violating Georgetown’s Code of Conduct for Licensees.
The Worker Rights Consortium accused Adidas in January 2012 of failing to pay $1.8 million in severance to workers of the PT Kizone plant in Indonesia after the factory shut down in 2011.
The Licensing Oversight Committee — a body formed of students and administrators that monitors the university’s apparel contracts — made a formal recommendation to the Office of the President on Oct. 11 that Georgetown terminate its contract with the corporation.
Although the recommendation called for the university to act by Dec. 15, Georgetown waited until yesterday afternoon to send a letter addressed to Adidas representatives Gregg Nebel and Chris McGuire announcing that the school would terminate its contract.
According to the letter, which is signed by Vice President for Public Affairs Erik Smulson, Adidas attempted to assuage the university but ultimately failed.
“As a Catholic and Jesuit university, deeply committed to the dignity of all persons and human labor, Georgetown University is steadfast in its commitment to improving the working conditions and lives of workers involved in the production of apparel that bears its name or logo,” Smulson wrote.
The letter indicates, however, that Georgetown might someday renegotiate a contract with Adidas.
“It continues to be our sincere hope that, going forward, the [Adidas Group] will take concrete steps to address and rectify the issues for the former workers of PT Kizone,” Smulson wrote. “When that happens, Georgetown University will be willing to reconsider its business relationship.”
Georgetownjoins multiple universities that have terminated their contracts with Adidas. Cornell University cut ties with the corporation on Sept. 13, 2012.
LOC student representative and Georgetown Solidarity Committee member Julia Hubbell (COL ’15), who helped organize a petition on change.org in September calling for the school to sever ties with Adidas, was glad to hear of the resolution.
“I am incredibly proud of the university and the decision that it has decided to make in ending its relationship with Adidas. I think it’s an incredibly important statement of our Jesuit values in action,” Hubbell said. “It is an important example of the university upholding its just employment policy — not just on campus, but internationally.”

The location of the Student Activities Fair, coupled with the university’s speech policy, created barriers Saturday for fraternities and other student groups that are not formally recognized by the university.
The fair was held in O’Donovan Hall, a building not among the university’s designated free speech zones. In past years, groups that are not recognized by the university and therefore not permitted to table at student activities fairs were able to set up tables in nearby Red Square and the lobby of LeaveyCenter, both of which have this designation.
At this month’s event, which was the first time such a fair was held in the spring, unrecognized groups were not permitted to set up tables within close range of the fair because there is not a free speech zone near the dining hall.
According to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, these groups wereinstructed that because the area outside Leo’s was not reserved for the spring Student Activities Fair, they could not set up tables outside but were allowed to distribute flyers and hold banners.
Sigma Phi Epsilon member Shane Thomas (COL ’15) was frustrated with what he described as a convoluted and unfair rule.
“We were asked to move from the front [of Leo’s] and the rule apparently was that the table couldn’t hit the ground … and it just didn’t make a lot of sense,” Thomas said. “[It] seemed like an odd administrative method … like [they were] looking for a way to get us out of there.”
Brian Saslow (MSB ’15), vice president of marketing for Alpha Kappa Psi, agreed that the rules seemed arbitrary.
“It didn’t make sense that we weren’t allowed to set up a table but we were allowed to stand out there with our sign. It seemed like a picky rule,” Saslow said.
Saslow said that he did not believe that these obstacles would significantly affect AKPsi’s spring recruitment, which is mainly conducted through information sessions and via Facebook.
H*yas for Choice, another unrecognized student group, chose not to attend this Student Activities Fair, anticipating these sorts of obstacles.
“It wasn’t something we discussed attending because we know the laws regarding free speech zones on campus really well. We knew that if we were to attend we would get kicked out,” H*yas for Choice President Kelsey Warrick (COL ’14) said.
Despite these hiccups, Student Activities Commission Vice-Chair Andi DeBellis (MSB ’14) was pleased with the event’s location.
“Leo’s was open and there wasn’t congestion at all,” she said.
The fair, previously and still commonly known as the Student Activities Commission Fair, changed its affiliation last spring to accommodate the broadened scale of the event.
In the past, the fair was not exclusive to student groups under the SAC advisory board, allowing tabling by groups under all the other advisory groups, including the Media Board, Advisory Board for Club Sports, Performing Arts Advisory Council and the Center for Social Justice’s Advisory Board for Student Organizations.
SAC fair was renamed the Student Activities Fair this fall to reflect collaboration between all advisory boards, the Georgetown University Student Association and the Student Group Union.
According to DeBellis, SAC requested a separate budget for the fairs at GUSA’s 2012 Budget Summit in order to alleviate SAC’s burden of supporting this campus-wide event.
“We requested $10,000 and spent approximately $5,500 in the fall and $4,500 in the spring,” DeBellissaid.
SAC Chair Jennifer Chiang (SFS ’15) attributed the difference in the expenses to space rentals.
“The expenses were more or less the same besides the space,” Chiang said.
Chiang said that the idea of holding a spring fair was prompted by requests from student groups.
“We started the spring Student Activities Fair as a response to some of our groups. A lot of them wanted to promote more during the middle of the academic year,” Chiang said.
DeBellis added that the spring fair provided extracurricular opportunities for students seeking more involvement in campus activities midway through the year.
“It’s a great opportunity for people who were abroad to get engaged again,” she said.
However, if the Student Activities Fair is not held on the front lawn or in Leavey Center, groups without access to the benefits that come with university recognition are likely to continue to experience similar difficulties in advertising their organizations and recruiting members, as they did this Saturday.
“The larger issue is that just because a group is not affiliated with Georgetown, it doesn’t mean they shouldn’t have the ability to be exposed to the same traffic as other organizations,” Thomas said.
Derek Embry (MSB ’15), Sigma Phi Epsilon director of recruitment, agreed.
“We deserve to have equal treatment as other groups. We should at least have some sort of exposure to the student body because I believe that students deserve to hear our story,” Embry said.

Kyla McClure (COL ’15) and Gianna Maita (COL ’15) are campaigning for the introduction of a major as part of the Program on Justice and Peace, which currently offers 13 courses, a minor in the College and a certificate in the School of Foreign Service, School of Nursing and Health Studies and McDonough School of Business.
McClure and Maita met with Georgetown College Dean Chester Gillis throughout the fall semester to discuss the process of developing a major. The JUPS minor already includes a thesis requirement and community-based learning element, and these aspects of the program will be extended to the major, but widespread student interest will be the most instrumental in garnering support.
Gillis supported the idea with a few caveats.
“I’ve made no promises — we need resources, but I think the program is robust and it could support a major given sufficient student demand,” Gillis said. “It would be wonderful if it could happen within the next year, but I’m not going to put a timeline on it. I’m not guaranteeing that it will be done at all. … I don’t want to create something I can’t support.”
Maita emphasized that students already commit so much of their own time and resources to the minor that a major would be the next logical step.
“Students pursuing a JUPS minor or certificate already have to complete a 50- to 60-page thesis, which is a requirement that not even all established majors have here,” Maita said.
If the university approved the major, Georgetown would be one of a handful of national universities to have a specific major in the subject, but more than 80 schools offer courses in the field.
Director of the Program on Justice and Peace Andria Wisler praised McClure and Maita’s efforts.
“The students involved thus far have shown how much they’ve learned in their JUPS classes,” Wislersaid.
Maita and McClure said that the process of advocating a major has been surprisingly simple to due the strong support of students, faculty and administrators.
“We’ve really been responsible for getting the word out,” Maita said. “In our collaborations with professors and deans, we’ve been received very well with our proposal.”
McClure agreed, adding that the support has come from students and faculty all over campus.
“We’ve received wide-ranging support from a variety of individuals from different groups as well, which I think speaks to how many people would benefit from the creation of this major,” McClure said.
McClure stressed that a JUPS major would be compatible with Georgetown’s Jesuit identity.
“Justice and peace studies embodies our mind, body and spirit approach to education,” McClure said. “It enacts our motto of cura personalis and ‘women and men for others’ in a hands-on and supplemental way that allows students to dedicate themselves more wholly to these ideals. We don’t want JUPS to just be something tacked-on; we want to give it relevance.”
Wisler emphasized that a major would increase the interaction between social justice work and study.
“There are a lot of people here who are committed to social justice,” she said. “I see a lot of students who don’t just want to do social justice work in the [Center for Social Justice], but want to study social justice in the classroom. … The questions we need to ask about the world fall between academic disciplines to create such an amazing JUPS classroom experience.”
Ideally, both Maita and McClure would like for current juniors to have the option to pursue a JUPS major, though they recognize the difficulties involved.
“When you look at the news, you can see that this is a rapidly expanding field,” Maita said. “We can’t continue on the paths we are currently on, particularly in respect to conflict resolution. A JUPS major would give new graduates a wholly different perspective on these pressing issues and provide for innovative thinking that could make for a better society. If Georgetown could be a leader in this growing field, it will be amazing for both the university and graduates.”

Students will now have GOCard access to all residence halls from 9 a.m. to midnight, an extension of the former 10 p.m. limit, the Office of Residence Life announced Tuesday.
The extension comes after a resolution passed by the Georgetown University Student Association in November that called for campus-wide GOCard access until 12 a.m. and 24-hour GOCardaccess within the Southwest Quad. The resolution also called for the elimination of access restrictions for unspecialized students to academic buildings such as the Rafik B. Hariri Building and Regents Hall.
The campus-wide email did not address the second two proposals and only referred to residence halls, not the entire campus, as part of the new extension.
GUSA worked with InterHall and the Offices of Residence Life and Student Housing to enact these reforms, claiming that extending GOCard access aligned with the goal outlined in the 2010 Campus Plan of bringing undergraduate social life back to campus.
GUSA Senate Speaker Nate Tisa (SFS ’14), who co-sponsored the bill, was excited to see it put into action.
“We’re thrilled to see that the university has responded to student feedback like this,” Tisa said. “The change will make it easier for students to live out the social lives they want on campus.”

The Center for Student Programs held its second annual Leadership Summit, which brought leaders of different student organizations together in Potomac, Md., on Jan. 7 and 8.
The retreat, which typically draws students from large campus organizations, attempted to better represent the overall student body this year.
CSP invited all students to register for the leadership summit regardless of organizational affiliation and advertised through HoyaLink, Twitter, Facebook and email. Additionally, CSP reached out to specific groups on campus, such as the Georgetown University Student Association and the Advisory Board for Club Sports.
However, some students in attendance noted that the makeup of the retreat still erred toward well-known campus organizations affiliated with the CSP.
“I think the retreat could improve by making the experience more available to the general student body. If I wasn’t in GUSA, I wouldn’t have known about the retreat,” GUSA Senator Ben Weiss (COL ’15) said. “There were a lot of people were from the same groups, such as the Programming Board and LEAD and [New Student Orientation] for example. There are other parts of the Georgetown student body that really weren’t represented, and it’s always better to have a more diverse group of student leaders to improve the network capabilities.”
CSP established the summit last year to consolidate and complement leadership retreats that organizations such as NSO, the Georgetown Program Board, Georgetown Opportunities for Leadership Development and the ABCS,had previously held separately. The summit, which was facilitated by CSP advisers, emphasized leadership, conflict resolution and teamwork training.
“The summit grew out of an effort to collaborate and build connections between many student groups that work closely with CSP,” CSP Director Erika Cohen Derr wrote in an email. “By pulling these groups together and opening up the retreat to other students we found that we could achieve the same goals for groups, and provide better context for networking, collaboration, teamwork, creative problem solving, cross-cultural conversations and personal leadership styles.”
The summit’s 40 participants left campus at 9 a.m. and traveled about 15 miles to Rockwood Manor Estate in Potomac, where they engaged in leadership workshops and discussions during the evening and spent the night in cabins at the retreat center.
Students attended the summit for free. Transportation, lodging and meals were funded by a variety of sources according to Cohen Derr.
The summit combined small group activities and large group discussions to teach leadership and networking skills.
Many students said that the diversity training led by CSP advisors Justin Smith and Sonam Shah was the highlight of the summit.
“The diversity training was really valuable and it began a conversation that we don’t really begin enough at Georgetown on what diversity looks like, what it means to be an ally and what it means to be really inclusive,” Center for Social Justice Advisory Board for Service Organizations member Morgan McDaniel (SFS ’13) said. “I think that a lot of people are going to take that away from the retreat and try to carry that conversation forward if not on campus as a whole amongst ourselves and our friends and our colleagues.”
Weiss noted that the training led to honest discussion among participants.
“Because we were able to start this conversation [on diversity] through the advisors’ exercise, I ended up having one of the best conversations I’ve had at Georgetown,” he said. “We talked for two or three hours about concepts of race at Georgetown, religion and other types of identities. It was just incredible and it was all students. Through the retreat, we were able to have this phenomenal conversation.”
McDaniel wished that there were more conversations about specific student activities’ goals for the semester.
“The workshops on leadership skills were really useful and beneficial, but I think it would also be really helpful to spend some time talking about student activities at Georgetown and the goals of our groups and our visions for how we want to leave campus at the end of the semester,” she said. “That would have been a really good way to spend our time as well. Finding a balance between those two elements could improve the retreat.”
Participants appreciated the chance to meet other student leaders on campus and hope to collaborate and network with them throughout the semester.
“This was a great opportunity. Now I know people and have had really good conversations with people in other advisory boards and in student groups, and now it will be easier to talk to them,” GUSA Senate Speaker Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) said.
“I thought the one-night stay was really great and I thought the retreat was a great energizer before coming back to school,” Student Activities Commission Commissioner and College Democrats Treasurer Katherine Key (SFS ’15) said. “My favorite part was that I got to connect with other people. It was really neat to connect with other student leaders, who I usually do not have much contact with and to see how they run their organizations.”
Student attendees said they appreciated the summit.
“It was a great opportunity to get away from the university and meet some new people and to gain a new perspective,” McDaniel said.
CSP administrators also felt the summit fulfilled its goals.
“Overall, we were pleased with the retreat and how well it met the intended objectives,” Cohen Derr wrote. “The students who participated were incredibly engaged, and took advantage of the opportunity to work with others, to share their stories and experiences, to consider and apply new knowledge, and to seek out different perspectives. Personally, I can say this was one of the highlights of my time at Georgetown.”

Owen Stanwood, assistant history professor at Boston College, spoke Friday to students about the Huguenots — French Protestants who fled France in the 16th and 17th centuries due to religious persecution — as part of the history department’s Early Modern and Global History Seminar.
Allison Games, Dorothy M. Brown distinguished professor of history and Stanwood’s first history professor at Grinnell College, facilitated the seminar, during which Stanwood spoke about his recent paper on Huguenots.
“I actually recently came across some papers I wrote for [Games’] class,” Stanwood said. “My first paper, I got a B minus; my second paper, I improved to a B. I’m hoping this one is even better.”
Stanwood began his research two years ago and has been writing a 40-page paper for six months; he plans to complete it within a few months. He is also considering submitting the paper as an article for The American Historical Review, and he attends three to four seminars a year to explain and revise his paper.
Games sent Stanwood’s paper to event attendees before the seminar so that they could read and evaluate the work.
Stanwood spoke briefly on the background of his paper before opening discussion up to questions, criticisms and comments. Stanwood was receptive to constructive suggestions, often writing down notes in response to audience remarks.
Stanwood noted that his interest in the Huguenots stemmed from a desire to visit Switzerland.
“It all started because I really wanted to go to Switzerland. I was invited several years ago to a conference in Italian Switzerland on this resort overlooking Lago Maggiore, and it was about Huguenots,” Stanwood said. “I knew some things about Huguenots in colonial America from my first book — but frankly, not that much — and I was terribly unqualified to give a paper, but I really wanted to go, so I decided to put something together.”
The widespread academic interest surrounding the Huguenots fascinated Stanwood.
“I’ve found it’s true that there weren’t that many Huguenots in colonial America, but lots of contemporaries were writing about them all the time and seemed to be speculating about Huguenots constantly,” Stanwood said. “So that became the big question that I had as I started this project, which was why everyone was talking about Huguenots when they seemed to be not very important at all.”
Stanwood then began to research the Huguenots’ role in political economy and began to see that while small in number, the Huguenots played a substantial role in economic networks around the globe.
Stanwood’s paper is also part of a larger book on the Huguenots that he hopes to complete in two or three years.
“What I’m really trying to do here is to test who’s holding the power in Atlantic global history by using the Huguenots as a case study,” Stanwood said. “I’m hoping in this larger project not only to elucidate the history of Huguenots globally in the early modern period but also to talk about how states develop globally in this period … the definitive period of imperial states.”
History students said that Stanwood’s article and discussion were helpful to their own research.
“I got a lot out of the discussion because this is a similar topic to one I’m writing about,” Dan Ludington, a doctoral candidate at George Mason, said. “It’s a really unique opportunity to be in the Washington area with all of these other institutions from [the University of ] Maryland, American and Catholic [Universities]. It’s something special that doesn’t happen in a lot of areas to bring in big-name scholars and important people here and create unique conversation.”
Stanwood also appreciated the chance to further develop his paper.
“The discussion was helpful,” Stanwood said. “I got a lot of great comments.”
