Islamabad – the administrative capital of Pakistan set up in the 1960s – and Rawalpindi – home to the General Headquarters of the Pakistan Armed Forces – are called “twin cities” because of their geographical proximity to each other. In the politics that is Pakistan, the twin cities see the bulk ofpolitical activity and clandestine deal makings.
When I went back home to Rawalpindi this winter break, the word on the street was that the Pakistan Peoples Party headed by President Asif Ali Zardari had outlived its welcome. Therefore, the question being raised in late-night military and political meetings was not when, but how to replace the PPP which has failed to deliver to the people in Pakistan and its sympathizers in Washington. A recent strategy was to let the Pakistani supreme court deliver a detailed ruling against the National Reconciliation Ordinance a 2007 political amnesty orchestrated by then-president Musharraf. The order had benefited politicians including Zardari, and ultimately allowed Zardari to be elected to power. But in order to inhibit PPP from claiming that the decision was politically motivated, the supreme court spent a busy month bringing cases against other political parties and top politicians.
Two years in, it is obvious that this experiment with civilian government has failed, and the twin cities are bracing themselves for a change. In an effort to salvage his political standing, President Zardari made frantic trips in late December to his native province of Sindh, as well as to Baluchistan, Pakistan’s least developed but richest province in terms of mineral and energy resources. He made appalling speeches referring to himself as the next martyr in line with Benazir and Zulfiqar Bhutto. Both are former prime ministers to whom Zardari is related who were both assassinated. He refrained, however, from directly accusing the Pakistan Army or his ex-benefactors in Washington for conspiring against him presumably in an effort to remain in their favor.
any joke that Zardari is blessed with the nine lives of a cat. He has already used up eight, according to many pundits. One of his most recent political blunders is the tussle over the Kerry-Lugar bill, which would grant non-military aid to Pakistan over the next five years to bolster its struggling economy. The aid is contingent on the subordination of the military to the civilian government. Opposition to the bill among military supporters numerous in Pakistani society is stripping away at Zardani’s political clout. As a result, the bill’s passage could fatally undermine the government it is meant to strengthen.
What is the reason for this paradox? The force that has allowed the civilian government to remain in power for two years, to put it plainly, is the army. This has always been the case in Pakistan, with the exception of Zulfikar Bhutto’s ministry back in the 1970s. The decade of democracy that started with Benazir Bhutto’s first ministry in 1988 owed much to the generals who allowed the civilian governments to function despite their weaknesses – a fact Bhutto acknowledged in her autobiography.
The reality is that the army chief, Gen. Kayani, remains the most important political agent in Pakistan. So what role has the military played in the current shake-up? It has refrained from instituting martial law, which it easily could have done on several occasions such as when Zardari’s government failed to deal with the lawyers who marched to Islambad last year seeking the restoration of justices who had been fired by Musharraf. Instead, Kayani personally called the head of the lawyers and the prime minister to broker an agreement that restored the chief justice who had been dismissed by Musharraf. Although this level of involvement was rarely referenced in foreign media, it is common knowledge in Pakistan.
Due to internal and external factors, the army in Pakistan will not lose its political relevance any time soon. Instead, Zardari is the one who has lost the most political leverage and foreign support due to his failure to overrule military’s objection to the Kerry-Lugar bill. Zardari has now resorted to pleasing the military to prolong his stay in power. He has, for example, picked up the army’s hard-line stance on Kashmir, which he had formerly dubbed irrelevant. The army does not want to impose martial law, so a change in civilian government would suffice at the moment.
But things are not that predictable in Pakistan. The present army chief doesn’t seem to have direct political ambitions. But he plans to retire this November, and more ambitious lieutenant generals are already lining up. What will this all lead to? It is hard to say. If one thing is sure, it is that the people are wary of another civilian rule, and all eyes are expectantly on the army to salvage their nation.

The whole thing reads like a political fairy tale: In a race to fill the seat of the Liberal Lion of the Senate, in arguably the most Democratic state in the country, with the fate of Ted Kennedy’s lifelong legislative aspiration literally hanging in the balance, a Republican surges from behind to a resounding victory. It is the political upset of the decade. And it comes only one year after President Obama was supposed to have realigned the political map and assure a liberal ascendancy.
The most immediate result, of course, will be the death of the health care bill. Obama – whose political standing has taken yet another blow – will be in a weaker position to advocate for its passage. Moderate congressional Democrats – already nervous about the controversial votes they have been forced to stomach – are on the cusp of outright revolt. And several senators have already made clear that all legislative action must be put on hold until Senator-elect Scott Brown (R-Mass.), who has indicated – indeed campaigned for – his potential role as the 41st vote against the legislation, is seated.
Of course, Congress may ultimately pass a health care bill of some sort. Nothing is for sure in U.S. politics – that much has been proven by the Obama saga. It appears clear, however, that the health care bill in its current form is doomed. Pundits and commentators will point to Democratic management in explaining the failure of the bill. And they will be wrong. Of course, the Democrats did little to help their own cause. But the failure of the health care bill is not from ineptitude of the ruling party; it is a failure of a mindset, an ideology, a general approach, which assumes that the federal government and its cumbersome, inefficient bureaucracy can solve our nation’s most entrenched public policy problems. The push for the health care bill – in which the private sector remains merely a nominal veil to shield government shot-calling – was the recent high-water mark of this mentality.
And while the health care bill is the most recent attempt for federal domination, it is far from the only attempt. Even when they pass, whether Republican or Democrat, legislative agendas that attempt to order large swaths of national life and culture through federal coercion always take on the same form: They touch upon too many interests, reign over too diverse a population and society and operate with too blunt and clumsy a mandate. The deals that were struck in order to shepherd the health care bill through the Senate seemed at best unfair, at worst, corrupt. Yet these deals are an inevitable result – an avoidable consequence – of a federal government that assumes it can take on one-sixth of a national economy and reorder it, as if retooling a machine that has malfunctioned. What is needed in Nebraska is not the same as what is needed in Massachusetts – as the “cornhusker kickback” and the election results in Massachusetts surely show. What is needed by union members is not needed by other workers – as the special tax break for union health care plans, and the backlash it has caused,undoubtedly show. And what is needed by the United States as a whole is certainly not a sweeping bill that forces us to choose between the inequitable and unsatisfactory.
Let the health care bill serve as a lesson to Democrats and Republicans alike. Just because a problem has national implications does not mean that it requires federal solutions. Just because the federal government can step in does not mean that it should. As a democratic state that delivered Obama a smashing victory in November, but a crushing defeat in January, has shown us that the only thing that should, and will, remain national about this bill is its rejection.

This February, the Diversity and Unity Initiative will usher in A Different Dialogue, a pilot program that will provide a platform for discussions on race and sexuality.
According to Dennis Williams, director and associate dean of students at CMEA, A Different Dialogue was built on the belief that dialogue should not consist solely of debates or open forums. Rather, the program seeks to provide students with an arena in which they can share their perspectives on certain issues as well as listen to other viewpoints. The focus is on understanding the perspective of fellow students instead of arguing or defending a certain point of view. Throughout the eight-week series, program-trained staff facilitators will be leading the dialogue.
“In mind with [University President John J.] DeGioia’s [Diversity and Unity] Initiative, we wanted to create a safe space for students to really challenge themselves and one another. A Different Dialogue will encourage students to think about their own identities and learn from different students,” said Aeriel Anderson, program coordinator for the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access.
Anderson stressed that it is not a CMEA program, but a division-wide project that was conceived by the student life working group of DeGioia’s Diversity and Unity Initiative, launched last spring.
A Different Dialogue will be split into separate groups of 14 to 15 students to discuss race and sexuality. The hope is that participants will build close relationships with each other and the dialogue will facilitate an environment of trust.
According to Anderson, the program is unlike other campus groups because it is funded by the university and facilitated by program staff members.
William Huff, area coordinator of Southwest Quad and Kennedy Hall, will be a race co-facilitator, along with Anderson. Stephen Quaye, a faculty member at the University of Maryland, College Park, is the primary coordinator for the dialogue. He will also be the co-facilitator for the dialogue on sexual orientation with Kevin Stensberg, assistant director of Resident Staff Life.
Quaye had been contacted about the program by Todd Olson, vice president of student affairs.
“I expect [A Different Dialogue] to be challenging for students,” Quaye said.
He said that students usually do not have opportunities to talk about race or sexual orientation, and that often when these issues are brought up in college classes, it is difficult for all students to express their views.
“A Different Dialogue is not like the more informal student dialogues, which have been very good. It’s a different model that’s been developed on other campuses. Similar programs have been offered as courses for credits in some schools. It has more structure,” Williams said. “It’s an ongoing dialogue as opposed to a town hall discussion.”
Quaye stressed that A Different Dialogue is open to students of all backgrounds. He said that the dialogue will be enhanced by such a diverse group.
“[A Different Dialogue] brings people over an extended period of time, they get to know each other really well, establish that trust, and get over those superficial boundaries,” Anderson said.”

As part of Martin Luther King Jr. Day festivities, Georgetown students and community members partook in the “Let Freedom Ring” event at the Kennedy Center on Monday.
Georgetown University, in partnership with the Kennedy Center, co-sponsored the event as a commemoration of King. Tickets were distributed through a lottery system and students who received tickets listened to the musical stylings of Grammy Award-winning artist India.Arie and the Let Freedom Ring Celebration Choir.
“It was a momentous and unforgettable experience to perform awe-inspiring music in an awe-inspiring venue,” Mary Grace (COL ’13) said.
“[We were] surrounded by musicians and public figures in celebration of the life of one awe-inspiring man. It was certainly an opportunity I would not have otherwise had.”
As part of the festivities, Dikembe Mutombo (FLL ’91), NBA legend and former Georgetown men’s basketball player, was presented with this year’s John Thompson Jr. Legacy of a Dream Award. The award’s previous recipients include Rosa Parks (posthumously, in 2006) and Colin Powell in 2005.
Attendees were surprised by the appearance of President Obama, who spoke about King and Mutombo.
“It was a cultural [and] enriching experience that made me extremely proud to be a Hoya,” Maggie Larkin (COL ’13) said. “Not only was the choir scattered with Hoyas, but President Obama, [University] President [John J.] DeGioia and John Thompson Jr. were all there to pay tribute to a Georgetown alum [Mutombo], who is really making a difference in the world.”
The event not only celebrated a great American leader, but allowed students to reflect on what it means to be a member of the Georgetown community and seek change in the world.
“Everything about the whole night was amazing,” Suzanne Fonzi (COL ’13) said. “We heard Dikembe Mutombo and the president speak. We represented well – Ryan Wilson (COL ’12) and President DeGioia gave great speeches and our choir members did a great job. I’ve never been so proud to be a Georgetown student.”
Obama concluded the evening by offering a final reflection on the late King.
“Let us remember the courage of the man who had that dream. Let us remember the perseverance of all those who have worked to fulfill that dream. Let us recommit ourselves to doing our part, in our own lives and as a nation, to make that dream real in the 21st century,” Obama said.
“Seeing Obama that close was an awesome experience,” Larkin said. “I came to Georgetown for experiences like this.”

About 450 people entered Gaston Hall on Thursday for the Cardinal O’Connor Conference on Life, a day of symposia in which anti-abortion advocates and experts discussed their views with peers from around the country.
The conference, sponsored by Georgetown Right to Life and the Knights of Columbus, is now in its 11th year. It attracted students from as far as Minnesota and Arizona, organizers said. It was a conference focused more on empowering advocates than converting opponents, said Steven Ryckbosch (COL ’11), grand knight of the Knights of Columbus. It was held to coincide with today’s March for Life, a national anti-abortion demonstration held annually in D.C.
“[Being anti-abortion is] nothing to be ashamed of,” said Caitlin Devine (COL ’10), director of the conference. “It’s something to be proud of. The conference helped people stay motivated and keep their eyes on the prize.”
Alveda King, niece of Martin Luther King Jr., delivered the first keynote of the conference, in which she discussed how the civil rights movement of the 1960s is connected to the contemporary anti-abortion movement in the 21st century. She said that fetuses, like blacks in their struggle for civil rights in the 20th century, lack a voice and need to be supported in civil rights movements.
At one point King instructed audience members to hold hands with one another and stomp their feet in an allusion to civil rights marches of the 20th century.
In the afternoon keynote, anti-abortion speaker Scott Klusendorf, established author and president of Life Training Institute, discussed ways for anti-abortion advocates to defend their position and persuade opponents to understand their perspective.
“You and I have been told a gigantic lie that abortion is a complex issue,” Klusendorf said. “No, it’s not.”
While the pressures to abort might be strong, especially for pregnant teenagers, he said, circumstances do not change the fact that there is a single morally correct decision to make.
“Can we kill the unborn?” Klusendorf asked a packed Lohrfink Auditorium. “Yes, we can, if the unborn are not human.”
“From the earliest stages of development, you were a distinct living, whole, human being. You were yourself a distinct living whole human entity,” he said.
Klusendorf concluded by urging supporters to leave the auditorium and “give them heaven.”
At the conference, Fordham University’s Right to Life Club received The Thomas King, S.J. Award, a $1,000 grant that was renamed this year in honor of the late Fr. Thomas King, S.J., who had been a key supporter of the conference, Devine said.
“He was such a good friend to Georgetown Right to Life and Knights of Columbus so we decided to honor him in a permanent way,” Devine said.
The prize, formerly the Evangelium Vitae Award, is offered to especially active and accomplished Right to Life organizations at universities, Devine said. The win was Fordham’s second in three years.”

As a result of time and attendance fraud, sanitation workers in the District have earned millions of dollars for overtime work that was never actually completed, according to an investigation by a team of auditors from the D.C. Department of Finance and Resource Management.
The D.C. Department of Public Works Solid Waste Management Administration incurred $4.19 million in overtime expenses, approximately $900,000 above the original budget allocation of $3.3 million, according to a draft of the audit.
According to an Online Legal Media news article, the auditors found a case in which an employee was incorrectly paid close to $1,436 for 10 days of work. Payrolls such as his were approved despite time sheets not coinciding with overtime earned.
“[The] SWMA is unable to produce certifying time and attendance documentation to justify expended overtime [hours] during fiscal year 2009,” according to the audit.
“[Hours] were not distributed equitably among employees . [and] payments were excessive and not authorized in advance . [and] we found instances of time and attendance fraud,” the audit states.
Auditors place the blame for this oversight on the department executives for “not monitoring time and attendance for employees” or “delegating” the responsibility to those who in turn rewarded family members and friends with unearned overtime hours, according to the audit.
“We confirm that at one point, the staff assistant was changing time and attendance information for her sister, her spouse and another employee who had not worked shifts but who had received regular pay,” the audit states.
“[Though the audit only covers the fiscal year of 2009], we [the auditors] believe . the practices have been ongoing as far back as fiscal 2002,” the audit states.
In the draft report, the auditors have recommended that the city’s inspector general investigate the abuses, according to the Examiner.
D.C. Councilmember Jim Graham (D-Ward 1), who oversees D.C.’s public works committee, could not be reached by The Hoya for comment, but has told the Examiner that he was taken aback by the news.
“This is the first time I’m hearing of this,” Graham told the Examiner. “I do not like hearing it.”

On Wednesday evening, University Information Services and InterHall held a town hall meeting at which students and university officials discussed plans to install wireless infrastructure in residence halls on campus.
Organized under the initiative of William Cousino (SFS ’12), InterHall’s vice president for student advocacy, the meeting gave students a chance to provide feedback and meet with UIS officials including Donna White, associate director of UIS, Raphael Terranus, UIS Help Desk manager, and Michelle Lapin, UIS enterprise product manager.
“I met with [White] pretty much monthly [starting] last spring,” Cousino said. “This meeting tonight was the culmination of the dialogue about a way for UIS to better contact students.”
The meeting began with a presentation on the services provided by UIS and was followed by a Q-and-A session, which provided students with the opportunity to ask about UIS’ plans for introducing wireless to residence halls.
“We’ve been working on designing a new wireless infrastructure for a year and a half now,” White explained to the audience.
According to White, plans to provide the over 80 buildings on campus – 13 of which are residence halls – with wireless connection have taken a long time to complete due to concerns over sustaining the system once it has been established.
“We’re very cautious about how we deploy things, especially when it comes to affecting the entire community,” White said.
Students raised concerns about the current structure and plans to upgrade the system, including providing wireless to areas that currently have no connection.
“We have approximately 900 to 1,000 [Access Points, which provide wireless Internet connection] already deployed on campus,” White said. “It’s very extensive and very expensive to deploy a new wireless infrastructure.”
White assured students, however, that the detail design has been completed and that UIS is in the process of evaluating its current solution, which is at an advanced stage.
“Residences are at the top [of our priority list],” she added. Some residence halls take precedence, according to White, including Village A, Village B, Harbin, New South and Nevils.
White concluded the meeting by saying that feedback from students is helpful to stepping up the pace of the process. Cousino addressed concerns over why it has taken time to organize a town hall with UIS on the wireless issue.
“The reason a meeting like this hasn’t happened before is because nobody’s always certain whom the right individuals to talk to are,” he explained. “Tonight, we managed to do that.”

Armed with patience and a resilient sense of humor, Gen. David Petraeus, commander of the U.S. Central Command, addressed students, faculty and staff yesterday afternoon in Gaston Hall, amid disturbance caused by about 15 anti-war protesters.
While his speech was originally slated to be an update address sponsored by the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, after making brief remarks, Petraeus turned the event into a forum for open and candid conversation. He was cut off several times throughout the event, however, due to interruptions by protesters, who rose from their seats to read aloud names and ages of victims of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The protesters were escorted out after being warned multiple times about the university’s free speech policy. Some were also standing with signs outside of Healy Hall.
The protesters were unavailable for comment.
Due to the interruptions, much of the discussion time was cut short; attendees did have the opportunity to ask questions concerning the United States’ current and past military operations in the Middle East, however. One student asked Petraeus what he envisions in a victory.
“This is not a war, this is not a conflict, this is not an endeavor in which one takes the hill, plants the flag and goes home to a victory parade. Rather this is something that requires a sustained, substantial commitment. We are fighting a network of extremists and extremism, and we have to go after that network wherever it is,” Petraeus said.
Petraeus continued by stating that winning, to him, was ensuring the security of American citizens as well as the safety of our major allies and partners.
Petraeus spoke at greater length on the United States’ current involvement in Afghanistan. He stated that success in the region depended on our ability to build relationships with leaders in Pakistan and in Afghanistan.
“Afghanistan is going to be the longest campaign in the long war,” he said. “It’s going to get tougher before it gets easier. There is an enormous amount of hard work to do there. There is time we have to make up for, without a question.”
Petraeus also stated that President Obama’s July 2011 withdrawal date for Afghanistan is dependent on conditions on the ground and will be executed at a responsible pace.
Some asked Petraeus how he is able to apply the lessons from Iraq or the Vietnam War, which was the subject of his dissertation at Princeton University, to the current counterinsurgency in Afghanistan.
“The biggest lesson [that I learned from Vietnam] was about the use of lessons,” Petraeus said. “It was the fact that again, every situation is unique. That, as you try to employ lessons from one conflict to another, you have to be very careful to avoid just taking it wholesale and importing it.”
Especially when comparing Iraq and Afghanistan, Petraeus cautioned that the strategies employed in the two countries could not be identical. He stated that one of the greatest challenges that the United States faces in Afghanistan, which was not as prevalent in Iraq, is the high illiteracy rate.
“[Afghanistan is] an area where you have to proceed with great care and with a very nuanced, granular appreciation for the local situation. It is a valley-by-valley, village-by-village effort. Much more so than what was the case in Iraq,” Petraeus said.
Some of the students who were present at the event were unhappy with the interruptions caused by the protesters, and believe that it reflected poorly on the university.
“What I took away from this speech was how embarrassing it was to see those kids standing up. There is a way to go about these things, and it was extremely rude,” Matt Loyd (SFS ’10) said.
“I feel that freedom of speech is a two-way street, and clearly the protesters didn’t feel the need to give Gen. Petraeus a chance to respond,” said Matt Hipple (SFS ’09), an ensign in the Navy.
Student political groups on campus also criticized the protesters for expressing their views inappropriately.
“We, the Georgetown University College Democrats, believe that right to free speech defines our American democracy. However, it is only when this free speech is combined with a respect for a diversity of opinions that we can have constructive and civil political discourse,” William Vogt (SFS ’12), GUCD communications director, wrote in a statement. “Short of that, we do ourselves and our nation a disservice when we drown out the voices of those with whom we disagree, closing our minds and stifling debate.”
The Georgetown University College Republicans echoed GUCD’s sentiments.
“[We] condemn the protesters’ actions at the event today. While everyone is entitled to have their own point of view, they still must respect the position and respect the military,” said Geoffrey Bible (SFS ’12), chairman of GUCR.

D.C. Public Schools are evaluating the possibility of relocating the Duke Ellington School of the Arts and converting the building located on the corner of 3–5th and R Streets NW into a public, comprehensive high school for D.C.’s Ward 2.
According to The Washington Post, D.C. School Construction Chief Allen Y. Lew’s office developed cost estimates for the relocation of Ellington to the currently empty Logan Elementary School building near Union Station. D.C. Public Schools spokesperson Jennifer Calloway said there are no immediate plans to move the school. The Logan building housed the School Without Walls, a high school that draws from all eight wards and uses non-traditional teaching methods, for two years before it moved back to its renovated building in Foggy Bottom last fall. When the Logan School became vacant, Calloway said that relocating Duke Ellington became a possibility.
“When [Logan], a former school building, recently became vacant, the Administration decided to begin researching an exhaustive list of possibilities for the space, Ellington was one item on a laundry list of ideas,” said Calloway.
Ruth Warner, a representative of D.C. Councilman Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), said that Evans is open to the idea of moving the Duke Ellington School to a location in the city that is more accessible by mass transit. Ward 2 is the only ward that does not currently have its own neighborhood high school.
Some parents at Duke Ellington are concerned about the school’s potential relocation, and believe that it may send a negative message from the Georgetown community, as Ellington’s students hail from all over D.C., as well as from Maryland and Virginia, according to Micelle Reaux, president of the School Home Association of Duke Ellington, a parent-teacher association.
She said that no parents or school officials have been part of discussions with D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee or D.C. Public Schools about moving the school thus far.
“We all are shocked, frustrated, and disappointed by this news that has reached us mainly through the press,” Reaux said.
Founded in 1974, the Duke Ellington School is the only D.C. public high school that provides students with a full academic course load in addition to professional arts training in disciplines such as dance, music, theater and visual arts, according to its Web site.
Reaux said she is worried that the new location will not have the features needed to accommodate Duke Ellington’s arts program. DCPS has spent millions of dollars investing in the current Duke Ellington location. If DCPS cannot afford to make renovations to the Logan building, Reaux believes the arts program at Duke Ellington may be discontinued.
The representative at Evans’ office said that DCPS will make the necessary renovations to the Logan school building in order to adapt to the Duke Ellington arts program, just as the building was altered to accommodate the School Without Walls.
Reaux said that only 5 percent of Ward 2 residents are under the age of 18, mitigating the need for a neighborhood high school.
“It seems as though any move to a new facility is not motivated by having the students’ best interest in mind, but would be strictly politically motivated,” Reaux said. “When that is the motivation, the students are generally on the losing end.”

While no members of the university community have been reported lost or injured as a result of the 7.0 earthquake that struck Haiti on Jan. 12, the university community has mobilized to raise funds for the recovery effort.
 
The natural disaster, which is estimated to have killed over 100,000 people, strikes home for several Georgetown students, faculty and staff members who have lost family and friends.
 
 
 
Valarie Craan (COL ’11), who was born and raised in Port-au-Prince until her move to Florida at age 16, has a personal stake in the catastrophe. While she knows that her family and friends are safe, the devastation of her home country is widespread. She briefly spoke to her cousin Cedric over a spotty Internet connection and was relieved to hear he was safe, although he was running out of food and water.
 
 
 
Craan is coping with the immensity of the destruction in her homeland.
 
 
 
“Whenever I didn’t feel at home [in the United States] I always thought `Oh, I have Haiti, which is so stress-free and happy. I can go back.’ Now I can’t. My fear is that it will never be the same,” she said.
 
 
 
Following the tragedy, the university community assembled to contribute to relief efforts and support the Haitian presence on campus. An interfaith prayer vigil organized by the Caribbean Culture Circle and Campus Ministry held on Jan. 15 commemorated the victims and called for solidarity in the time of crisis. Marta Rifin (COL ’10), a Haitian student, moved many in the crowd of over 80 people to tears with her rendition of Haiti’s national anthem, which she sang in Creole.
 
 
 
“I thank everyone for being out here in the cold and showing their love. I am Haitian, and this tragedy is more than just a national headline. It’s my nation . I’m so blessed to see you all here. It means a lot,” Rifin said.
 
 
 
At the vigil, University President John J. DeGioia spoke of the need for continued action.
 
 
 
“We offer our deepest sympathies, as none of us can ever comprehend the magnitude of this tragedy . Even as our hearts have reached out, let us give all that we can. Let us in this moment answer the call to be women and men for others.”
 
 
 
Some of the fundraising efforts on campus started at the Jan. 15 vigil. The CCC placed boxes in front of the Healy steps at the vigil, and those boxes of donations combined with the collections taken from the men’s and women’s basketball games this weekend totaled over $1,390.
 
 
 
CCC has several other fundraising projects in the works, including a blood drive for the Red Cross, as well as talk of recruiting Wyclef Jean for Georgetown’s spring concert.
 
 
 
Anthony Peña (SFS ’10), president of CCC, said the efforts of the university community have been outstanding, yet stressed the need for a long-term commitment to relief in Haiti.
 
 
 
“This is a longstanding effort that takes a collective effort to aid in recovery. The [CCC] and Georgetown both need to actively continue this effort for future years. There is much more work to be done,” Peña said.
 
 
 
Immediately after the earthquake, university leaders charged the Center for Social Justice with organizing students in response to the tragedy, similar to when it mobilized in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Suzanne Tarlov, associate director of the Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching and Service at CSJ, put together a donation Web page that has been linked to a bank account. So far, CSJ has received $15,415 in online donations and also has received a $10,000 check. All proceeds will be divided among three charitable organizations: Jesuit Refugee Service, Save the Children and Partners in Health.
 
 
 
Other efforts that the CSJ is organizing include a push to place more donation boxes at various Corp locations and at the Georgetown University Medical Center.
 
 
 
Tarlov stated that a group of students from the Jesuit Universities Humanitarian Action Network at Georgetown is discussing a possible humanitarian relief trip this summer. She also detailed plans for several graduate students to form an educational panel consisting of experts on Haiti who could explain its history and culture, giving the Georgetown community a greater understanding of the earthquake’s impact.
 
 
 
Tarlov emphasized the impressiveness of the Georgetown student body’s response to the earthquake.
 
 
 
“Students should feel proud that they are a part of Georgetown. I’ve been so impressed by the motivation of these students and their desire to help others. It’s truly heartwarming and unique to Georgetown in particular,” Tarlov said.
 
 
 
The GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee passed a bill, proposed by Sen. Nichol Nelson-Goedert (COL ’10), to donate $1,000 to the CSJ fund. The final legislation will be debated at the GUSA senate meeting on Jan. 24.
 
 
 
Other fundraising efforts include Georgetown College Academic Counselor Erin Curtin Force and several Georgetown College students’ tabling efforts outside of the College Dean’s office to raise money for relief efforts. Accumulating over $700 in two days, Force and her fellow fundraisers were thankful for the enthusiastic response.
 
 
 
“We just wanted to do something to help . The students who manned the table were thrilled to witness such kindness,” Force said.
 
 
 
The French department, after pledging $500, is also conducting a fund drive for earthquake relief in Haiti in conjunction with Helen Scarry, Roman Catholic chaplain of Campus Ministry.
 
 
 
“Because Haiti is a francophone country, the French department felt particularly compelled to show solidarity with those affected by the earthquake. Funds collected by the department will benefit the Religious of Jesus and Mary, a Roman Catholic Congregation of Sisters that has ministered in Haiti since 1997,” said Susanna Lee, associate professor in the French department.
In another fundraising event, the Georgetown Unconventional Eaters club is holding an authentic Haitian dinner Friday night to raise awareness and collect donations to support recovery in Haiti.
 
 
 
“We are now taking advantage of our love for food and transforming it into something that matters,” President of GUE Tory Pratt (SFS ’11) said.
 
 
 
Other campus clubs, such as Students Stopping the Trafficking of People and the Georgetown chapter of UNICEF, took immediate action, updating members with detailed e-mails and directing them to news links and donation opportunities. UNICEF has been tabling all week in Red Square, and according to UNICEF’s program director Susan O’Rourke (COL ’12), the Georgetown branch of the organization plans to inform members of the university community on the aftermath of the earthquake as the semester continues.
 
 
 
“UNICEF is committed to providing support to the people, especially the children of Haiti, not only through its immediate response, but also through its continued presence during the rebuilding period,” O’Rourke said.
 
 
 
Georgetown University Alumni & Student Federal Credit Union has established a Haiti Relief Fund, which allows students to transfer money to that account. The Student Commission for Unity is planning a silent art auction to raise funds. Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., executive director of Campus Ministry and his colleagues are preparing a Catholic Mass of Remembrance for the People of Haiti on Feb. 2 in Dahlgren Chapel.
 
 
 
Susan Martin, director of the Office of Environmental Health and Safety, has also organized an academic panel, set to take place Jan. 28 in ICC Auditorium, at which panelists will discuss Haiti’s history, culture and its current state of affairs.
 
 
 
The Scholarships for Education and Economic Development Program, which runs through Georgetown University’s Center for Intercultural Education and Development, has been particularly affected by this earthquake. SEED recruits students from impoverished areas of the Caribbean and South and Central America, including Haiti, and equips them in the United States with technical and leadership skills at various community colleges for two years. After their schooling, the students return to their home countries with the education necessary to facilitate the improvement of their own communities.
 
 
 
The SEED coordinator in Haiti is unhurt, as are his two staff members. One staff member’s house collapsed as she was gardening in the backyard with her children, however.
 
 
 
According to SEED Director Paul Silva, 50 Haitian students currently study in the United States through SEED. Georgetown’s CIED is doing everything it can to assist these students; it has located 42 of the students’ families and continues to contact SEED alumni to check on their status. Silva said SEED hopes to set up several of its graduates in the humanitarian response teams like the NGOs that acted quickly in the earthquake’s aftermath.
 
 
 
Efforts on the Hilltop do not stop with current faculty, students and programs, however. Alonzo Mourning (COL ’92), former Georgetown basketball star, started The Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti with fellow NBA star Dwayne Wade. According to ESPN, it has already raised over $800,000 in pledges. Mourning is currently in Haiti surveying the target areas for such a fund.
 
 
 
Another alumnus, Jacques-Philippe Piverger (MSB ’99), launched The Haiti Project through his nonprofit organization, Global Syndicate. The Haiti Project aims to hold major fundraising events in six major U.S. cities and hopes to generate more than $500,000 for the cause.
 
 
 
Businesses in the surrounding Georgetown community are also actively pursuing Haitian relief efforts. Georgetown Cupcake raised $6,000 by donating all of its red velvet cupcake sales to Haiti relief on Jan. 13 and 14. Qdoba will donate 5 percent of its profits to Haiti relief from Jan. 18 to Jan. 24.
 
 
 
Today, several Georgetown area businesses are participating in Jefferson Prep’s fundraiser for Doctors Without Borders. With a $10 cover charge and encouraged donations, participants will receive food and drinks catered by Sweetgreen, Rugby Café, Chipotle, Georgetown Cupcake, and Vita Coco and live music provided by DJ Alex of MecTec.
 
 
 
The Kennedy Center is hosting, in partnership with the Embassy of Haiti, “An Evening for Haiti,” featuring Haitian performers and dancers tonight. The concert also features Georgetown’s “Let Freedom Ring” Celebration Choir and the National Symphony Orchestra. Proceeds of the event are directed to the Haitian relief effort. ”

On Monday Georgetown University Student Association Finance and Appropriations Committee unanimously passed an act that, if passed by the GUSA Senate, will make the Georgetown Program Board and all five student advisory boards accountable to GUSA.
Under the new system, the Finance and Appropriations Committee will be the only body with the authority to distribute funding from Student Activity Fee accounts. The $50 fee is mandatory and is paid by all undergraduate students. The current Funding Board will be abolished.
Under the current system, the Funding Board – a 13-member body composed of the seven Finance and Appropriations Committee members, a representative of the Georgetown Program Board, and one representative from each of the advisory boards – controls and allocates the Student Activity Fee.
If the pending legislation passes in the senate, the Georgetown Program Board and the advisory boards will continue to be a part of the funding process by working with the GUSA Executive to draft a detailed budget each year that will be submitted to the Finance and Appropriations Committee at a budget summit. After a period of debate and revision, the budget will be presented to the GUSA senate for a vote.
The act states that the budget summit must be held no later than 21 days following the swearing in of the new Executive.
The Finance and Appropriations Committee and its chair Nick Troiano (COL ’11) first considered this legislation in November in response to the survey GUSA distributed to club leaders in the fall to assess their views of the funding process.
“[Finance and Appropriations Committee] members spend the entire year sitting in on meetings and working with the various advisory boards, and we feel we can do a thorough and fair job allocating the student activity fee annually, in a more streamlined and transparent way than the funding board [does],” Troiano said in an e-mail.
According to the committee, one of the main concerns its members have with the current allocation of the activity fee is that Funding Board members, except the board’s seven GUSA representatives, are not elected by the student body. The non-elected Funding Board members represent the Georgetown Program Board and the five advisory boards – which represent the Student Activities Commission, the Center for Social Justice, Research, Teaching and Service, Club Sports, the Media Board, and the Performing Arts Council.
The Finance and Appropriations Committee also expressed concern that the current funding process is unnecessarily cumbersome and unfair because the boards vote on their own budgets which they then allocate to the clubs they represent.
“The conflict arises between each group inherently advocating for the maximum amount of money they can get and playing a role as part of a larger body to ensure funds are allocated fairly and based on merit,” Troiano said. “Some might say GUSA is voting on its own budget – we do – but the conflict on our end is mitigated by the fact that the budget is drafted and presented by the incoming Executive and it needs to be passed by the full senate.”
The Student Activity Fee was instituted in 2001 via referendum. Half of the fee is allocated for immediate budgetary needs for student activities, while the other half is designated for future use in a student activities endowment fund.
The Student Activity Fee’s endowment fund currently stands at $2.2 million, short of the $10 million goal that was set for the initiative in 2001.
This new legislation follows Sunday’s GUSA meeting, in which the senate voted to remove GUSA’s reserve account, which was created without the knowledge of the senate or the Executive, in order to stay true to their criticism of advisory boards’ excess reserve funds.
“This is a crucial step in our overall effort to improve the system of student activities funding by making it more democratic, accountable and efficient,” Troiano said.”

David Remes, adjunct professor in the government department, shared his experiences as a legal representative for Guantánamo Bay detainees and his thoughts on the prospect of the detention camp’s closure in Copley Formal Lounge on Tuesday at “The Future of Guantánamo,” an event sponsored by the Institute for Law, Science and Global Security.
Remes criticized President Obama’s administration and the slow evaluation system that used a task force to review detainees’ cases. Jan. 11 was the eighth anniversary of the opening of the detention center at Guantánamo Bay, and exactly one year ago, Obama pledged to close the Guantánamo Bay detention center within one year.
“The Obama administration has made a lot of mistakes along the way,” Remes said. “Instead of taking a diplomatic approach – concluding an agreement with another country – he has installed a system that structured to review profiles of individuals, which has significantly slowed the process.”
Obama has succeeded in transferring 42 prisoners overseas, which Remes claimed was not a good record for a president who made closing Guantánamo Bay a signature issue.
Remes also deliberated whether the United States has the legal authority to detain the prisoners.
“For six-and-a-half years, every day, people were held in jail when the authority that held them was questionable. In that respect, the government won,” Remes said. “Yet, for the past year, the court heard 41 cases, out of which prisoners won 32 cases. It is a pretty good track record.”
Remes said that many of the men detained at Guantánamo Bay are political victims of domestic conflicts in their own countries.
“People are caught all over the world. It is important to understand that [the United States] had apprehended only 5 percent of men in Guantánamo,” Remes said. “[The United States] had paid rewards of $500 per head. These men were scooped up by the wrong people with wrong reasons, in my opinion.”
He later dispelled rumors that 20 percent of people who are released from Guantánamo Bay return to al-Qaida or other terrorist groups.
A Q-and-A session followed the lecture.
“It was helpful and fascinating to hear from somebody who has a real experience [with] the stories that I had only read through articles and books,” Alisha Crovetto (COL ’10) said.
“Georgetown is very fortunate to have someone like David Remes come and teach,” said Catherine Lotrionte, assistant director for LSGS, in her introduction of Remes. “Georgetown has been committed to social justice and human rights . David Remes cares for the same thing.”
Remes was a lawyer for Covington & Burling for 25 years; last year, however, he decided to leave his life-long workplace to devote himself to human rights litigation and representing detainees of Guantánamo Bay.”

Vice President of the Office of Advancement Jim Langley is departing Georgetown University, Jeff Donahoe, director of development and campaign communication for the Office of Advancement, confirmed on Wednesday.
University President John J. DeGioia wrote in an e-mail to his colleagues, “I am personally very grateful to Jim for his service to the university. Please join me in thanking him for all he has accomplished at Georgetown and wishing him great success in his future endeavors.”
DeGioia outlined many of the contributions Langley has made to the university, which include expanding the Office of Advancement, spearheading Georgetown’s fundraising campaign, and developing a new alumni relations program.
“Perhaps most significantly, Jim has helped everyone who cares about Georgetown see more clearly what we are capable of achieving through more sophisticated and ambitious advancement strategies,” DeGioia wrote in the e-mail.
“He worked hard for Georgetown,” said Sean Redmond (SFS ’97, SCS ’00, MBA ’11), a member of the Alumni Association Board of Directors.
According to the e-mail, DeGioia has asked R. Bartley Moore (SFS ’87) and Paul O’Neill (CAS ’86, GRD ’96), who have worked in the private sector, to oversee the Office of Advancement until a replacement for Langley is found.
Langley will start his own company, Langley Innovations, once he leaves Georgetown, according to Redmond.
Langley wrote on his blog that he will continue to do work in the field of advancement.
“Rather than represent a single institution, I am creating a company, Langley Innovations, to represent the interests of advancement professionals everywhere, to help them realize opportunities through strategic insight and the creative engagement of their constituencies, and to preserve and enhance the highest purposes of philanthropy itself,” Langley wrote on his blog yesterday.
The university has not given any reason for Langley’s departure.
The Office of Advancement works to develop relationships with alumni and donors to raise funds for the university, according to its Web site.
R. Bartley Moore was unavailable for comment.
Paul O’Neill declined to comment.”
