Wisconsin Avenue taco restaurant Surfside will close its original Glover Park storefront at the end of 2019 to open a new location up the street in Tenleytown this fall. 
Surfside has been at its first location since it opened in 2008. The exact opening date of the new storefront, located at 4200 Wisconsin Avenue, is still to be determined, according to Eaghmon Banks, the manager of Georgetown Events. Georgetown Events, Surfside’s parent catering and food service company, also owns other local restaurants in Northwest Washington, D.C., including Jetties, The Bullpen, Due South and Millie’s.
Georgetown Events has been looking to expand Surfside for over a year in order to offer more comprehensive services and options, Banks said.
“We’d been looking for a bigger spot,” Banks said in an interview with The Hoya. “We want to do full service, and we’re just kind of outgrowing the spot right here in Glover Park.”
The new Tenleytown location will feature sit-down service, compared to the walk-up counter ordering system currently in place. The restaurant will also include a 24-hour walk-up window where customers can order from the menu at any hour of the day, and the expanded service will also increase the staff at the location, according to Banks. Surfside’s second location in DuPont Circle already has a walk-up window for its late-night customers from nearby bars and clubs. The new location will offer 250 parking spots for customers, according to Banks.
Surfside also plans to offer jobs to students at its new location, although the restaurant may be too far to make it practical for Georgetown undergraduates to work at the taco shop, Banks said.
“We can also have jobs for students that are looking for part-time jobs,” Banks said. “So actually by expanding we will be able to offer more jobs for people in the city.”
Surfside’s further distance from Georgetown’s main campus will reduce the number of students willing to make the hike to its new location, according to Amanda Perry (NHS ’20).
“Although I have only been to Surfside a few times, it was a great, reasonably priced taco and burrito place that was wasn’t too far from campus,” Perry wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Unfortunately, I do not think I will be making the trek to Tenleytown where its new location will be anytime soon, it’s still sad to see the staple taco place closing its Glover Park location.”
Assistant Manager Kevin Chavez Lopez, who is enrolled in graduate school classes at American University and will not have to commute as far from campus as a result of the move, said the restaurant is moving because Tenleytown is an area of D.C. quickly growing in popularity.
“I’m kind of excited at the fact that it’s going to be much closer than it is right now,” Lopez said in an interview with The Hoya. “Also, the parking lot is going to be much bigger, so it will be easier for me to find a place to park.”
Surfside originally planned to open two new locations in 2019, one in Tenleytown and the other at the Wharf, according to Eater. The company wanted to capitalize on the Wharf’s late night crowds, especially concertgoers at The Anthem, but tabled plans for a new location there last February. 
The restaurant will have the same owners and the same chefs who have been serving Glover Park, Banks said.
“We’ve enjoyed being in Glover Park. I was here from the beginning with these guys,” Banks said. “They love Glover Park, but sometimes you just move out of a neighborhood. We’re just moving up the street, expanding the concept.”

The Hoya Hub, an on-campus food pantry, expanded to twice its original size over the summer allowing for free perishable food items to be available to the Georgetown University community for the first time.
Although talks of expansion have occurred since the food pantry first opened, the actual renovations, which included knocking down walls and expanding into a former dark room in the Leavey Center, took place this summer. The Hoya Hub first opened last October as part of an initiative by the Georgetown University Student Association to combat food insecurity. The food pantry is open 24 hours a day and is available to anyone in the Georgetown community.
Prior to the renovations, the pantry was limited to nonperishable food items. Last year, the space was able to provide over 10,000 nonperishable items to over 200 undergraduate and graduate students, according to Hoya Hub Student Advocacy Organization treasurer Samuel Dubke (SFS ’21). 
The renovations to the Hoya Hub include a refrigerator, new shelving units and space for more equipment, according to Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs Erika Cohen Derr, who oversees food pantry operations.
“From the inception of the food pantry, there was hope for a larger space to accommodate more inventory and the option to add perishable items,” Cohen Derr wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The larger space can now accommodate a refrigerator which can include some perishable staples — milk, cheese, yogurt, for example — and also frozen items.”
With the additional capability of an expanded and updated space, the Hoya Hub received its first perishable items from Food Rescue DC, a local branch of the national company Food Rescue US that distributes excess food throughout Washington, D.C.
Refrigeration allows Food Rescue DC to be more involved with the Hoya Hub moving forward, according to Food Rescue DC site director Kate Urbank (SFS ’83). 
“I’m so encouraged that the hub has expanded and doubled its size and now it includes refrigeration,” Urbank said in an interview with The Hoya. “That means Food Rescue US can do significantly more rescues to the hub than we were able to do before.”
In addition to the Hoya Hub, which is administered by the Center for Student Engagement, involved students are also engaged in a new club development process to be fully recognized and receive Access to Benefits status. The new club, the Hoya Hub Student Advocacy Organization, will be separate from the pantry and reside in the Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching and Service. 
The club will allow students to engage in advocacy surrounding food insecurity that extends beyond Georgetown’s campus, according to Hoya Hub Student Advocacy Organization president Julianne Licamele (COL ’21).
“Our club itself is more focused on student advocacy and food insecurity as a systemic issue rather than just running the food pantry,” Licamele said.
The added space will allow the food pantry to be more group friendly, making students feel more comfortable visiting the Hoya Hub with their friends, according to Licamele. 
“Additionally, the new space means that people can comfortably visit the pantry in groups,” Licamele wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Many people who use the pantry tell me that they come with their friends, so it makes sense to make the space more group-friendly.”
In the future, the Hoya Hub Student Advocacy Organization has plans of further collaborating with Students of Georgetown, Inc., commonly referred to as The Corp, according to Dubke. At the end of the last school year, the Swipe It Forward Flex Donation Drive allowed students to apply their excess Flex dollars toward purchasing bundles of $5, $10, $20, $50 or $100 associated with a variety of nonperishable food items.
Handling the planning, funding and execution of the renovated space through the CSE shows the university’s potential to act upon student advocacy on campus, according to Licamele. 
“I think that this expansion represents the university working with us to dignify pantry users,” Licamele wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Students who benefit from the pantry deserve to have a space that is large and comfortable. The project speaks volumes about the potential of Georgetown to work with us when we identify real needs of students.”

The five fall Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service fellows, including four Georgetown alumni, bring a variety of backgrounds to their positions including experience in public policy, political communications and journalism.
The fellows include Republican policy and political advisor Jonathan Burks (SFS ’99), former Republican Kansas Governor Jeff Colyer (COL ’81), Senior Advisor to the Human Rights Campaign Olivia Alair Dalton (COL ’06), ABC News reporter Karen Travers (COL ’00, GRD ’03) and EquisLabs co-founder Stephanie Valencia.
Fall 2019 is the GU Politics Fellows Program’s ninth semester. The program gathers professionals involved in Washington, D.C. politics and advocacy to give students insight into real-world happenings and problems. The Fellows hold weekly discussion groups as well as office hours with the goal of giving students an insider’s perspective on working in Washington and in politics more broadly. 
The fellows discussed their desire to pass on what they’ve learned from their various career experiences when engaging with students in a Sept. 6 interview with The Hoya.
Why did you decide to become a GU Politics Fellow? 
Burks: I think the thing for me was the opportunity to come back to a place that had been so formative in my entire approach to my career, and sort of an opportunity to come back to Georgetown and really participate in a unique program. That, being part of the McCourt School, but having so much involvement from the rest of the university as well just gives you this opportunity to really have an impact and really come back to a place that is special to me, as an alum.
Dalton: I mean so much of us came to Georgetown as undergrads and/or graduate students because of our interest in public service. Georgetown played a similarly formative experience and sparked a passion for me … I’m excited and proud to be part of an opportunity to try and create that experience for students who are here today. 
We also all talked about how all of us had sort of wished there had been a Georgetown Institute of Politics when we were here in order to really make the most of what this city has to offer. So it’s really exciting that the McCourt School now has an opportunity and has given us all a platform to come back and do that.
Travers: Yeah, I’m really excited to learn from students and have a refreshment of the cynicism of Washington and just get past that and not think of the negativity because I think the students here are not going to be as negative and jaded and cynical as everybody who is east of 37th Street, hopefully. And I’m very excited to feel energized about what younger people are thinking about politics and also to help students think of different career options.
There are many options, there are many different ways of getting involved in politics and public service and there’s such a great alumni network in this town. I think you need to know how to navigate it, though. One of the things we can do here is help students tap into that.
Colyer: Yeah, and so there’s some really unique paths that kids can put together here at Georgetown. When I was here, I was economics and pre-med, which is something nobody would have let you do, but at Georgetown, talking about service, I really think that the students that I’m meeting, they’re different. They really do want to serve, they’re thinking about it and they won’t take no for an answer.
What are your discussion groups about? Why did you choose that topic?
Burks: So I’m going to be talking about politics meets policy and really exploring how political decisions or political electoral outcomes are affected by policy debates and how policy debates are driven by electoral decisions and sort of that interplay. And I think for me the reason it’s important to think about these issues and really work through them is that I think there’s a lot of disaffection generally in today’s body politic, and a lot of that is because of a disconnect between our politics and our policies. And so, trying to think through that.
Colyer: So in my session we’re going to look at strategy and we’re going to look at service. And that you’re here to serve, to make a difference and what are some of the strategies and then how do you apply them to different things, how do you apply them to your career, how do you apply them to healthcare and health policy and how does that system really work on a really personal level.
Travers: I’m going to be looking at how you cover the White House in this era of Trump and what rules he has changed, maybe permanently, and how this could be the new norm for covering an administration … The question I get asked all the time when people hear what I do is ‘What’s it really like?’ It’s exactly like you think, but a thousand times more crazy. Everything you see is exactly what it is, and then just assume way worse. So pulling back the curtain on what that’s like, and then how this toxic climate of president hates the media but he also relies so heavily on the media and there is truth to what he says about the media needing him because people are tuning into us because he drives so much coverage, but how that has spilled over into people’s cynicisms about the entire process. 
Students interested in your respective fields may already be interested in talking with you, but why might other students who don’t share those interests benefit from talking with you? 
Dalton: What I hope students will come talk to me about is if they have an interest in politics but aren’t sure if it’s a career for them, if they’re a really strong writer, you know, I was also a history minor. If you have these kinds of interests, come talk to us and explore what kind of career opportunities are out there. 
When I was an undergrad, I thought of political communications as C.J. Cregg on the West Wing, and that’s about it. There’s such a wider world of opportunity out there, speechwriters, researchers, digital communications today. And to understand what kind of roles and opportunities there are out there in the world for your specific talents I think is something that all of can offer in our respective fields but hopefully one that students will really take advantage of.
Coyler: Students looking forward, I think you can have multiple careers and you can even have dual careers. I still do surgery and was involved in politics. You can go and create some interesting things, and this group of people has a really diverse experience in that. And you can still participate in all of these there, and so we want people to visit whether your a physics student or whatever. We want to visit with you, we want to see what you’re thinking about.
Valencia: Policy and politics impact everything, every part of our life, whether we believe it or not or want it to or not. And so I think that whether you’re a physics major or pre-med track or interested in a very specific path in politics, I think you will get something out of any number of our discussions. Either just to see a different perspective on the world and expand your worldview or to see how your particular issue gets affected by policy and politics.
GU Politics tries to bring together a diverse group from different backgrounds and ideologies. How might you model discourse even through disagreement at a time when polarization is a real issue? 
Burks: I think one of the big misconceptions out there is the intensity of the disagreements on substance mean that you’re that intensely disagreeable with each other. I have a ton of friends who are on the left side of the political spectrum, and always have and hope I always will, and so I think one of the benefits of coming to campuses, hopefully showing students that in the real world you don’t have to be at each other’s throats just because you disagree with each other.
Travers: I think what we see of the disagreements, we’re seeing it through Twitter, and we’re seeing it through one minute of a video where people are just shouting at each other and the rhetoric is just so nasty in those spaces but that doesn’t necessarily reflect what happens in meetings or what happens on the hill. People are passionate of course and are going to fight for their side, but I think we’re unfortunately boiling everything in policy and politics down to those fights right now and there’s so much more happening in this town. 
I think especially with the advocacy work, it’s not the fight of the mechanics of legislation but it’s doing very important, significant communications to get a message out there and I don’t think people realize that that type of stuff is happening in this town. Everyone just thinks it’s gridlock on the hill and the president can’t get anything done and that’s it. There’s a lot happening in this town that should give reason for optimism but all we see — because of my industry — is focusing on the cynicism and negativity.
Valencia: And I think also just the kind of group we have here, you know the bipartisan design of the program. I mean here you have somebody, I mean I worked for Barack Obama for 10 years of my life almost and he worked for Paul Ryan, where can we model really good behavior to students in having conversation about where we can find common ground and how we can work on issues like immigration, we were starting to talk about that last night, so I think we will be able to create a sense and space among ourselves that can be modeled to the broader community that I hope we will take away from this also.
Dalton: And be a rejection of some of the toxic politics that I think we all abhor out there right now. Despite the bipartisan nature of the table, I think there are things, I won’t speak for others, but I think that we all see and abhor in the sort of politics of today and Washington.
