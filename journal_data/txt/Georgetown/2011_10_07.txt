Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner Tom Birch’s proposal of a second alternative to the redistricting of ANC 2E last Thursday has failed to assuage some Georgetown students’ representation concerns.
ANC 2E’s initial redistricting proposal, which would have grouped 2,581 students into each of two single member districts, provoked student accusations of gerrymandering last month. Birch’s new plan would bring the number of students contained in the SMDs down to 2,096 and 2,061 individuals, closer to the 2,000-person limit recommended by District law. The proposal would also group students living in LXR and Darnall Hall into adjacent SMDs alongside permanent residents in the areas near those residences.
Though student leaders applauded Birch’s efforts to bring the two districts closer into line with the legal limit, they remain concerned that those grouped into districts composed mostly of permanent residents would not be fairly represented.
“LXR is being grouped in with a primarily non-student district,” said ANC 2E commissioner Jake Sticka (COL ’13). “Even if every student in LXR registers a vote, they will never be properly represented.”
This summer, five students on a working group composed of students and neighbors assigned by D.C. councilmember Jack Evans to design a new redistricting proposal this summer suggested an alternative to the co-chairs’ initial proposal. The plan, which was drawn up by working group member John Flanagan (SFS ’14), included two Georgetown districts containing about 2,000 students, each with a third district composed of about 50 percent students living in LXR, Nevils and several nearby townhouses.
Though the plan was outvoted by the proposal ultimately put forth by the working group, Sticka said he stands behind the Flanagan plan.
“[The] plan was better,” Sticka said. “It would provide real incentive for whoever represented the third district to balance the interests of students and residents, which is only fair considering the numbers. That’s how the democratic process should work. We need elections that can be competitive.”
Commissioner Ron Lewis, who opposed the Flanagan plan, said that a mixed district would essentially guarantee a third student seat.
“His third district would have 1200 students in it. Add that to a district that already has several hundred students living in houses … and it would pretty much be a guaranteed student seat. He knows that,” Lewis said.
Alykhan Merali (SFS ’13), spokesperson for the student advocacy group DC Students Speak, said that while Birch’s plan is a step in the right direction, it does not fairly represent Georgetown students.
“It’s great that we’ll get two districts, but at the same time, the plan still isn’t completely representative of the student population. Students make up approximately 45 percent of the population of Georgetown,” Merali said.
Like Sticka, Birch believes that mixing students and permanent residents in a district has merit, but does he not believe that his plan will drown out the student voice in mixed districts.
“It’s good public policy to look toward attempting to create districts where there will be contests [between students and permanent residents]. There’s more and more tendency in redistricting to put all the republicans in one box and democrats in another, and I think that’s what the plans that came before mine were looking more like,” he said. “My plan still provides opportunities for contests.”
Birch noted that LXR is already located in an adjacent district that includes permanent residents and is represented by Commissioner Bill Starrels.
“The point is [that] there are issues that are important to students living on and off campus that all of us are concerned about. I think that it’s worthwhile to recognize that,” Birch said.

French professor Kathleen Delgado died following a long illness Tuesday morning.
She had taught introductory French as a part-time lecturer since 2001. She also taught English as a Foreign Language at Georgetown from 2001 to 2002.
“A true Francophile, she shared her love of France and all things French with her students to whom she showed remarkable dedication. A delightful presence in the French Department, Professor Delgado was known for her sunny optimism and her generosity toward both her students and her colleagues,” the university said in the email announcing Delgado’s passing.
Prior to coming to Georgetown, Delgado worked as a program analyst in the International Office of the Air Force Research Labs and taught French at the University of Hawaii, the University of Texas at San Antonio and other institutions, according to her faculty profile.
Delgado is survived by her husband. A funeral Mass will be held at Saint Mary Catholic Church in Arlington on Oct. 13.

Plans for the Intercollegiate Athletic Center, a new 125,000 square-foot athletic complex, were presented to the Old Georgetown Board Thursday with drawings showing the two-story structure adjacent to McDonough Arena.
The board ─ which is a branch of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts that assures projects in the Georgetown area fit the style of the existing historical architecture ─ expressed disappointment with aspects of the reformulated proposal.
They questioned the way the proposed construction would obscure the main entrance of McDonough, as the drawings depicted the complex filling the parking lot area in front of McDonough. In the current plans, McDonough would face a service entrance of the IAC.
According to Thomas Luebke, secretary to the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts, OGB members also balked at the low height of the building. Some felt that it should be built taller to take advantage of the scarce space on campus ─ a concern that figures prominently into the university’s current 2010 Campus Plan hearings.
According to Luebke, the board disliked the planned glass wall of the building that would face West Road, which runs adjacent to Reynolds Hall.
Additionally, at least one member was concerned about the destruction of a 200-year-old oak tree that stands in the way of the new facility, according to Georgetown Patch.
Plans for the IAC were first submitted to the board in 2007, and the board expressed concerns about the scale of the building at the time, according to Luebke. In response, the university significantly reworked the plans to present anew.
The most recent drawings, revised based on feedback from previous meetings, reduce the building’s size in the original proposal by 35,000 square feet and two stories. Though the members sent Georgetown back to modify its proposal once again, they agreed that this version was an improvement
“This new case was looking somewhat better,” Luebke said. “It was basically a new project.”
Word of newly reformulated schematics for the IAC broke two weeks ago. In the first mention of the project in years, Intercollegiate Director of Athletics Lee Reed announced details in an email update to the university community on Sept. 21.
The email said the structure will house practice courts, locker rooms, team meeting rooms and coaches’ offices for the men’s and women’s basketball programs. Locker rooms for men’s and women’s soccer and lacrosse as well as weight training facilities and training room areas for all varsity athletes are also slated to be built.
In addition, the IAC will house a new student-athlete academic center, auditorium and team meeting facilities for all varsity sports programs. The Georgetown Athletic Hall of Fame, currently located in the Leavey Center, will be moved to the new building.
“The need for the IAC has never been more important than now, and it is the most urgent priority for the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics,” Reed wrote in the email.
The university will now need to come back to the board with a revised design. Once officials back a concept design, they will then approve a more detailed final design plan. According to Luebke, it took the New Science Center and Rafik B. Hariri building almost a year to gain final design approval.
“For a project this big, it’s very common for it to do this concept design several times,” he said.
After the board green-lights the final plan, it must go through a number of other advisory stages before the university can break ground.
University officials could not be reached for comment at press time.

Graduation rates at colleges across the nation remain sharply below Georgetown’s 93 percent figure, according to a report released on Sept. 27.
Complete College America, a non-profit group that focuses on educational problems, found that 53.2 percent of students in the 33 states that submitted data complete a four-year bachelors program within six years.
Though District universities did not participate in the study, Georgetown’s graduation rate of 93.96 percent of undergraduates who earn undergraduate degrees far surpassed the national average.
“Georgetown has some of the highest retention and graduation rates in the country,” Rachel Pugh, director of media relations, said. “I think this speaks to the caliber of our students and faculty, as well as our support programs for undergraduates.”
This graduation rate is more than 10 points above those at local institutions. The George Washington University and American University reported rates of 80.6 percent and 79 percent respectively.
Though Georgetown’s figure lags approximately four percentage points behind that of Yale University’s 98 percent, it surpasses the rates of many of its closest competitors. The university edged out Boston College’s 91 percent and Johns Hopkins University’s 92 percent.
“We spend a lot of decanal energy assisting students with the planning of next semesters of study with the horizon always there of earning the degree,” Senior Associate Dean of the College Anne Sullivan said, adding that deans send periodic updates to seniors in danger of leaving requirements unfulfilled.
While the university’s leadership puts great effort into maintaining a high graduation rate, Sullivan said a student’s academic experience is ultimately more important.
“To me there is nothing magic about four years. We see students graduate early and late for a host of different reasons. Finishing the degree is very important — the timing of the degree less so — and we work with our students toward that goal every day,” Sullivan said.

Holy Rood Cemetery has all the looks of a haunted graveyard. Perched at the crest of a hill and held above Wisconsin Avenue by a stone wall, the cemetery looks from the street like the setting of an Edgar Allen Poe thriller. It serves as a solemn gatekeeper to the neighborhood of Glover Park.
Inside, however, Holy Rood is a treasure trove of American history. Home to the remains of former slaves, Irish and German immigrants and at least one veteran of the Revolutionary War, the graveyard is also, strangely enough, the property of Georgetown University.
Carlton Fletcher knows Holy Rood inside and out. Fletcher, a 40-year resident of Glover Park, is the neighborhood’s unofficial historian. He has spent the last 15 years combing archives and indexes, and has compiled a thorough history of the entire neighborhood. Holy Rood, however, has been a focal point of his research.
Sitting on his front porch on a cool Wednesday morning, Fletcher explains why the graveyard piqued his interest.
“I started studying my neighborhood history in 1995, and almost immediately it became clear to me that the most historical, most venerable part of our area was the Holy Rood Cemetery,” he says. “It’s a fascinating place. It has lots to learn from it. It’s not very well understood by most people what it is.”
What it is, he explains, is an old parish cemetery, one that took in Catholics from all walks of life, charging the rich and burying the poor for free. It is a motley graveyard full of contradictions, with wealthy Washingtonians lying alongside black slaves. It is almost every aspect of Georgetown’s history clustered into one hilltop.
An Unwelcome Deed
Holy Rood Cemetery was founded in 1832 as the third parish graveyard for Holy Trinity Church. At the time, Holy Trinity fell under the watchful eye of the Jesuits at Georgetown College, so the school was listed as the rightful owner on the land deed. Parishioners were charged with the upkeep of the yard, but the university kept meticulous records of the burials that occurred there.
In 1942, Holy Trinity Church transferred into the new archdiocese of Washington, leaving its graveyard in the hands of the university. Georgetown protested, arguing that the Archdiocese should assume responsibility for the cemetery’s care, but the archbishop refused, suggesting that the land may be useful to the school in the future. The university ended up with a 100-year-old graveyard that it hadn’t wanted in the first place.
Eventually, university officials decided that there was a better use for the plot, and they began to investigate the possibility of exhuming the remains and developing the land. With views of the Capitol building, the National Cathedral and the Washington Monument, the old cemetery was a gold mine of real estate value, and if the university could find somewhere else for the bodies, it would be able to cash in on the true value of the land.
University officials contacted the archdiocese to discuss their options. Initially, it seemed that the archdiocese would agree to help exhume and rebury the bodies, but legal troubles eventually caused the deal to cave. Nevertheless, the university decided in 1984 that it would close the cemetery to burials as the first step toward development.
A public outcry followed. Several families still owned unused burial plots in the cemetery, and they took Georgetown to court, arguing that they still had a right to the land. In the end, they won, and the university was required to keep the cemetery open until the last contract had been fulfilled.
‘Skimping on Maintenance’
These days, the cemetery seems unthreatened, at least by university architects. The 1984 attempt to develop the land came as a public relations black eye to the university, and since then it has not introduced any new movements to remove the graves.
“There are currently no plans to develop the land,” Rachel Pugh, director for media relations, wrote in an email.
That does not mean, however, that the university has had a change of heart.
“Georgetown maintains Holy Rood cemetery,” Fletcher says, “But it does not do it with enthusiasm.”
In fact, in 2008, the university came under fire for its negligent care of the cemetery. An Aug. 28 article in The Washington Post drew attention to the poor state of the yard, blaming Georgetown for “skimping on maintenance.” According to the article, toppled tombstones and thick weeds frustrated neighbors, some of whom had relatives buried in the graveyard. Bill O’Keefe told the Post that he was saddened every time he went to visit his parents’ graves.
“I was simply appalled that a university like Georgetown didn’t care enough to do moderate or reasonable maintenance,” he told the Post. “It’s supposed to be holy ground … I just think it shows a disrespect for the dead.”
In response to The Washington Post article, the university cleaned up the graveyard to a certain extent, though a walk through the cemetery still reveals shattered headstones and marred monuments. Fletcher also points to a thick overgrowth that he says still covers several graves,
“It’s not really their fault,” Fletcher says of the maintenance crew that cares for the graveyard. “I think they give the guys a week to take care of it all, and no one is going to take hand shears and go around each individual grave,” he says.
The university contends that it invests plenty of resources into graveyard preservation.
“Georgetown performs routine maintenance at Holy Rood — including mowing the grass, removing decayed trees, repairing the fence and conducting spot security checks,” Pugh wrote in a different email. “These costs are covered out of our facilities operating budget.”
In response to charges that Georgetown has skimped on its monetary commitment, Pugh also recalled a major renovation that occurred about six years ago.
“A few years ago the University spent more than $1.5 million to repair the retaining wall adjacent to Wisconsin Ave,” she wrote.
Recently, there have been murmurs of a revitalization project sponsored by Holy Trinity Church. In a Sept. 20 article on Patch.com, writer Susan Bunnell noted that Holy Trinity Church has discussed the possibility with its parishioners.
“Holy Trinity Catholic Church has been asking its parishioners about the feasibility of negotiating with Georgetown University to have the cemetery returned and to begin improvements,” Bunnell wrote.
It is unclear whether the university is on board.
A Story of Heroes
Admittedly, the Holy Rood narrative can make Georgetown out to be the villain, but Fletcher takes care to debunk that view. In fact, he says, Georgetown’s emphasis on record keeping likely saved the cemetery’s history from fading away.
Parishes, he explains, are notorious for their failure to keep accurate records, and it is likely that Holy Trinity Parish would not have been as precise as the university archivists.
“If Holy Trinity and Holy Rood had not been under Georgetown, then records would not have been kept. If it wasn’t for Georgetown, none of this would have survived,” he says.
Fletcher says that he can also understand why the university may be frustrated with the land.
“The university has the property, and they can’t do anything useful with it. … Georgetown is not in the business of keeping graveyards.”
Still, walking between the tombstones, it is hard to imagine Holy Rood being dug up and replaced by a university complex, especially because it seems like Fletcher can point out something notable in almost every direction.
Take, for example, the gravesite of Joseph Nevitt. Located on the far fringes of the cemetery, Nevitt’s gravestone stands just two feet tall and bears only his name, dates and age. Fletcher, though, recognized the name as he was sifting through records of Revolutionary War pensions, and was able to identify Nevitt as a minuteman from Maryland. That two-foot gravestone is one of the last marks of a seasoned veteran of the Revolutionary War.
“He was the kind of man that as he walked through Georgetown, people pointed and said ‘That man was a Revolution hero,'” Fletcher says, standing by his tombstone.
About 50 yards away, Fletcher motions to the gravesite of Thomas Henry French, another war veteran, this time one who was present at the Battle of Little Bighorn. French ended up fighting just a few miles away from Custer’s Last Stand. Though he survived the brutal campaign against the Indians of the West, he succumbed to alcoholism just a few years later.
The tour could go on for hours, but Fletcher has to get back home.
Grounded in Contradictions
It sounds bizarre to call a cemetery an oasis, but for Glover Park neighbors, Holy Rood seems to be just that. One man sits on a crumbled gravesite and reads the New York Times. Another patrols the far fence, walking casually with his thoughts. Fletcher says that the homeless sometimes even set up camp in the middle of the cemetery. For a park designed to honor the dead, it seems strangely alive.
On the western side of the graveyard, a birdwatcher keeps a lookout for migratory species. He says that he used to enjoy the cemetery more when it was overgrown; back then, he could see more deer.
Nowadays, he says, the deer are mostly gone, but the does still return to give birth. It seems a contradiction — new life in the midst of all the death — but in Holy Rood, that contradiction seems to be right at home.

As students rush around the corner toward the Leavey Center Starbucks and Cosi, they may notice that a once-deserted space has undergone a spiritual awakening.
Makóm, a new Jewish gathering area located along one of Leavey’s main thoroughfares, is a sign of wider changes at work for the Jewish Chaplaincy and Hillel. Just in time for the observance of Yom Kippur this weekend, Jewish students have seen an uptick in campus awareness and university support for their faith community.
“Many of my friends from home found it slightly odd that I was going to a Jesuit school, considering the fact that I am Jewish,” Randi Lawrence (SFS ’15) said. “But I have found the Jewish community here both very welcoming and surprisingly active. It is so comforting to see so many fellow students show up to Shabbat services each Friday — it makes me feel like I belong.”
Jewish Student Association Co-President Samantha Sisskind (SFS ’12), who has been involved in Jewish student organizations since her freshman year, echoed this sentiment.
“[The Jewish community] is a feeling of home within Georgetown,” she said. “It’s been very significant to my experience over the last several years.”
While the chaplaincy operated for many years out of a rented townhouse on 36th Street, the new, centrally located Makóm has already upped attendance at many JSA events, according to Sisskind.
“It’s central, it’s beautiful and it’s big. Students are thrilled about it and see it as a major statement of support [from the university],” Rabbi Rachel Gartner said of the area.
The new space is the latest development in a trend of rising university backing of the Jewish ministry on campus. In 2010, the university agreed to help foot the cost of renting the JSA townhouse — which had formerly been funded by donations — after students called on the university to address the chaplaincy’s tightened budget and capacity.
Makóm’s location is only temporary, as Jewish student space will eventually form part of the new Interfaith Center, set for completion in the next several years. According to Gartner, the finished project will contain spaces for the Muslim and Jewish communities, as well as multi-purpose space and a kosher kitchen.
The construction of the Interfaith Center will knock out the hallway connecting Hoya Court to Cosi and Starbucks, and a new diagonal hallway will take its place. According to previous statements from the Office of Mission and Ministry, the timeline on renovations will depend on financing sources and contributions.
In conjunction with the fresh space in Leavey, the Jewish Chaplaincy has a new leader this year in Rabbi Rachel Gartner. Appointed last spring, the New York native’s life journey has been rooted in her faith.
“I grew up in a family where my mother was really into Reform Judaism, and my father was very, very committed as a cultural Jew,” she said.
Gartner explained that her deeply ingrained beliefs were challenged in college when she had difficulty answering friends’ questions about her traditions and faith. She knew, however, that she wanted to be able to respond. This search for answers led Gartner to Israel, where she lived for nearly two years. It was during her time there that she decided to attend Rabbinical school.
Now at Georgetown after her most recent posting as Miami University of Ohio’s rabbi and executive director of Hillel, Gartner has been more than welcomed by students of the Jewish community.
“She brings a whole new energy. Rabbi Rachel is a big part of the new robust community that we now have,” Sisskind said.
Gartner is only the second permanent rabbi to lead the Jewish chaplaincy on campus. The first, Rabbi Harold White, retired last year after more than 40 years of service. He remains a member of the faculty in the Program for Jewish Civilization.
When White came to campus in 1968, however, Georgetown became the first Catholic university to hire a full-time rabbi.
He originally established the chaplaincy in order to increase interfaith understanding and provide a sense of community for Jewish students.
“There’s something wonderfully mysterious that occurs at Georgetown,” he said. “The connections being established between religions, spirituality and public policy — I believe that these are very important.”
According to White, the first Jewish students graduated in 1954, but it was not until the mid-1960s that he saw a noticeable rise in the number of Jewish students on the Hilltop.
White credits the leadership of President Edward Bunn, S.J., namesake of the Bunn Intercultural Center, for increasing the Jewish presence on campus.
“Bunn asked a prominent D.C. rabbi to join the university’s board of directors. From there, his focus on recruiting more Jewish students was quite evident.”
When White arrived on the Hilltop, the JSA had already begun to establish itself as a presence after a year on campus.
“We hosted Friday night Shabbat and dinners in the rented JSA house off campus,” White said. “It was a very active program.”
White estimated that 12 to 14 percent of the current student body identifies as Jewish and that these students strongly feel the need to exhibit their religious identity.
“At Penn and other schools with 35 percent Jewish students, you don’t need to do anything to show your religious identity,” he said. “Being in the minority, you have to, or you lose that identity.”
White’s goal of inspiring a sense of Jewish solidarity has been fully realized, according to JSA Vice President of Religious Affairs Eric Hoerger (SFS ’12).
“The Jewish community has contributed a great deal to the phenomenal experience that I’ve had on the Hilltop” he said. “The benefits to such a community extend well beyond the religious aspect itself. I’ve met an amazing group of friends who met via the organization but have grown to be defined by common interests as well.”
For White, the university cannot hope to meet the needs of many Jewish students until a kosher kitchen is a reality.
“Once we have a kosher option, the number of Orthodox students will rise,” he said.
For now, the new space is a welcome fresh start for the new year.
“The new Jewish space has given us the opportunity to be a much more visible presence on campus,” Hoerger said. “For the first time, we can comfortably seat 30 to 40 students for Shabbat services. We also have a lot more opportunities with programming and storage. Overall, it’s been great.”
This sense of welcome is exactly what Gartner hopes the Jewish community will foster in its members and guests.
“It’s an incredible opportunity to stretch and to learn. That’s the gift of being a small, diverse community,” she said.

As more national retail brands move into the neighborhood, local small businesses are feeling the pressure.
According to Jim Bracco, executive director of the Georgetown Business Improvement District, the area has seen a 10 percent increase in chain store openings in recent months; this brand of retailer now occupies 40 percent of area storefronts.
Local bars and eateries are also suffering from the economic pinch. Saloun, a popular M Street bar known for its live music, will close its doors on Oct. 19.
Saloun’s general manager, Yasmine Afshar, cited high rents and a changing neighborhood as reasons for the close.
“[The residents] want a high-class clientele, and they want quiet,” she said. “The dynamic of the neighborhood has completely shifted. It’s not about keeping ma and pop stores around.”
Afshar added that Saloun and other pubs have struggled in ways that retail shops have not.
“Chain retail stores don’t have as much trouble. They don’t have to worry about licensing or protesting from the residents. They have lawyers and financial backing, and they close at 9 p.m.,” she said.
According to Raji Rankins, manager of the M Street urban clothing and accessory store Da Closet, her shop will soon have to relocate to either the U Street area or Silver Spring, Md., because of consistently low profits.
“We’ve taken such a dramatic hit being down at Georgetown,” said Rankins, whose store currently operates out of the Shops at Georgetown Park mall complex on M Street. “Business is slow. There’s not a lot of traffic.”
“[Georgetown] is not a district set up for small businesses,” Rankins said, adding that he believes the neighborhood’s atmosphere, not the national recession, has hurt small businesses.
“None of [the local Georgetown businesses] are making money.”
But Bracco thinks that local businesses’ struggles reflect a wider trend.
“Retail is challenging right now, even for the chains. People aren’t spending,” he said, pointing to greater troubles within the national economy.
As shops struggle to deal with the local and national economic downturn, students are beginning to notice the atmosphere of decline.
“I think that the Georgetown mall is a sad place; it actually gives me an eerie feeling because it’s so empty,” Erika Charleston (COL ’12) said. “In this community we are sort of sheltered. The mall is a glimpse of what the economy is really like in the U.S.”
Adam Paegle (COL ’13), a native of the D.C. area, said that he thinks the community surrounding the university has lessened its support for small businesses.
“When I was in high school, Georgetown was the place to go. We all wanted to come down here — it was like Adams Morgan. But the residents don’t want the area to be a destination for tourists, they want it to be exclusive,” he said.
Charleston said that she thinks the neighborhood’s priorities have visibly shifted toward luxury boutiques.
“It seems to me that stores catering to a middle class clientele have lost their customers,” she said. “But the fact that Brooks Brothers opened … shows that some people are still willing to shell out for super-luxury goods,” she said.
Thomas Cooke, a distinguished teaching professor in the McDonough School fo Business, said that Georgetown has tailored its marketing efforts to the high-end shopper.
“It doesn’t surprise me that the small businesses are suffering,” he said. “The middle class shopper just isn’t coming to Georgetown. They know the discounts are few and far between.”
Wink, a small M Street clothing store that sells chic designer clothing, seems to have benefitted from this shift in demand.
“We don’t really feel the recession,” said Emily Rubin, Wink’s store manager. “We have our regulars who are still shopping, and we get tourists as well, thanks to our location.”
George Alabarenga, the store manager at Booeymonger’s Delicatessen located a few blocks away, said that sales have been slightly less predictable in 2011.
“Compared with other years, it’s kind of slow,” he said. “[It’s] up and down.”
But not all area restaurants have experienced this decline.
According to Sweetgreen manager Damaris Escobar, the M Street salad shop’s profits were about the same as they were this time last year. The company — founded in 2007 by Nicolas Jammet (MSB ’07), Jonathan Neman (MSB ’07) and Nathaniel Ru (MSB ’07) — has expanded to nine additional locations since its opening in 2007.
While there are no plans to move Sweetgreen to a larger facility, Escobar emphasized that the shop has no plans to downsize or leave the neighborhood.
Bracco mentioned that the historic nature of the neighborhood can make store expansion tough and rent prices high.
“We’ve got a lot of old buildings. It’s hard to make those spaces work sometimes,” Bracco said.
He added that he thinks members of the local business community, especially those specializing in clothing sales, can overcome the economic challenges that they currently face.
“We still had a large amount of small businesses opening up this year,” he said. “We are the leading neighborhood for fashion and shopping.”

Starting this week, a long-anticipated electrical upgrade project in Lauinger Library will install additional outlets on every floor.
The project, which began Tuesday, will last until early December. Upgrades are planned to the electrical paneling in the building as outlets are added.
Contractors hired by the university will work on a floor-by-floor basis, starting on the fifth floor and working their way down to the lower levels.
For Samantha Lin (SFS ’14), a major concern is how much her studies will be affected by the construction.
“I think it is important for upgrades to be made, but I worry that they will interfere with the quiet environment Lau provides while we study,” Lin said.
Though the construction, which will involve work-related noise such as drilling, is slated for completion between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m., certain areas of Lauinger may be closed for several days, according to the email sent by University Librarian Artemis Kirk.
The library’s website provides a schedule for the first half of the project, showing that upgrades will take one week per wing of each floor throughout the month of October.
“We always consider the impact to users of the library and regret the potential inconvenience. In light of the growing need for more electrical outlets, [the university] agreed that it was better to start the project as soon as possible,” said Phyllis Barrow, director of finance and operations for Lauinger Library.
According to Barrow, the university acknowledges the potential inconvenience to visitors of the library, but it believes inconvenience is a small price to pay for the overall improvement.
[University Facilities has] long been aware of the need to upgrade the electrical systems to keep up with the technology demands of today,” Barrow said in an emailed statement.
Students hope that more outlet access in the library will help alleviate the high demand during peak study times.
“Competing with a fellow student to claim the last outlet during high-stress study periods can be uncomfortable,” Brady Fowler (COL ’14) said. “I look forward to not having to bring a surge protector during finals week this year.”

Writing about topics from food reviews to bulldog care tips, faculty and administrators have taken to Twitter in recent years, bridging the gap between their professional and personal lives.
While for most the social media service serves as a mode of personal communication, for academics it offers a way to share valuable work-related information with both students and peers.
As more faculty members begin using the site as an expansion of the classroom, they often find that their private and public lives blend together in 140 characters.
When Fr. Christopher Steck, S.J., became one of the first Georgetown professors to join Twitter in 2009, he did not intend for it to be an extension of his academic work.
“When I first started tweeting, it was mostly personal,” he said. “I used Twitter like a Facebook on the go. I didn’t tell people I was tweeting, but they found out.”
As Steck’s account gained followers, he began including links to articles he found interesting and informative.
“I got involved in curriculum reform at Georgetown and saw how important it was to bring [students and alums] into the conversation, so I started including more content about higher education and pedagogy,” Steck said.
Still, he peppers his feed with tidbits from his day-to-day experience.
“TGIF baby! just got out of a meeting 45 minutes early!! Yes, there is a God,” Steck wrote in a recent post.
He commented that despite his drive to share educational material, his personal tweets, especially those focusing on his care of Jack the Bulldog, are the ones most likely to be retweeted.
Professor Garrison LeMasters, who teaches in Georgetown’s communication, culture and technology department, also praised Twitter’s ability to spread invaluable ideas among peers.
“It’s as though you’d gone to a cocktail hour at an international symposium, and never left. If other scholars’ disciplines aren’t like that yet, they soon will be,” he said.
However, LeMasters also uses the service to connect with his students outside of the classroom.
“First day of classes, just 2 weeks away. Now I just need to think of something to say,” he recently tweeted.
According to LeMasters, Twitter’s tendency to merge public and private information is indicative of a larger cultural change.
“If your tweets are strictly professional, you’re missing the point,” he said.
Director of Student Programs Erika Cohen-Derr, who has been tweeting for a few months, also seeks to strike a balance between posting personal and professional information on Twitter.
“I think of it as a tool to share information related to my role as director of student programs, though occasionally I use it to communicate with friends,” she said. “In general my work doesn’t conform to a traditional 9-to-5 schedule, and sometimes my communication patterns may reflect that.”
Still, Cohen-Derr recognizes that her Twitter’s primary role is tied to her position. The Center for Student Programs has started its own official Twitter account, which Cohen-Derr thinks may replace her need to use her personal Twitter for professional reasons.
“The value of Twitter for my work is to find additional channels to share information, amplify the good work that student leaders and student organizations are doing and stay connected to students,” she said. “I think that, like other faculty and staff, I have to be conscious of the overlap between my work-related and personal tweets.”
But even with all the focus on the professional aspects of a Twitter account, faculty still find time to loosen up with an occasional humorous post.
“Why is everyone in such a hurry for Bert and Ernie to marry? Clearly, their relationship works for them,” LeMasters wrote this summer.

The Knights of Columbus recognized Georgetown’s chapter as its Outstanding College Council of the year last Friday.
The Knights of Columbus — an international all-male Catholic fraternity with over 14,000 parish and community councils including more than 260 on college campuses — has origins on the Hilltop dating back to 1972. This was their third time receiving the distinction of best national council, which was bestowed at an annual gathering in Connecticut.
According to the group’s chancellor, Stephen Levy (SFS ’13), Georgetown’s council made it its goal last spring to achieve this recognition.
“I don’t think our guys were expecting it when they went up to Connecticut,” Levy, who is the deputy online editor of The Hoya, said. “So it was a really great surprise for the entire council.”
Georgetown’s chapter, which includes about 40 students, received the award for the demonstration of a strong commitment to community service, social justice activism and spiritual formation.
“We worked pretty hard to put on a lot of events for the Catholic community and for the Georgetown community at-large,” said group lecturer Kieran Raval (COL ’13). “So receiving this recognition definitely gave us a sense of accomplishment.”
In addition to holding a range of religious functions throughout the year, the Knights of Columbus have an active presence off campus.
“The Knights is a service-oriented fraternal organization, and one of our core principles is charity,” Raval explained.
One such program, run in conjunction with St. Paul’s Parrish on K Street, involves delivering breakfast to the homeless in D.C. The Knights also work with mentally ill criminals who are living in Virginia halfway houses and deliver donated diapers to underprivileged mothers in the District.
“Some people may think that the Catholic Church is in decline in the U.S.,” Levy acknowledged, “but looking at the college councils and the turnout we saw in Connecticut, it actually looks like the Knights are doing quite well and increasing members at the college level.”

Tunisian Prime Minister Beji Caid Essebsi addressed the far-reaching impact of the Arab Spring and the resulting Tunisian Revolution Wednesday in Copley Formal Lounge.
Sponsored by the Office of the President and the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies, Essebi spoke about his hopes for the future of Tunisia and the Arab world in light of the wave of pro-democratic revolts that have rocked the region since December. Essebsi took office on Feb. 27 after former Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi resigned under pressure from the revolts in his home country.
According to Essebsi, assuming his role in the midst of civil strife has given him first-hand knowledge of the revolutionaries’ goals for the country and its neighbors. He stressed that the revolution combined Tunisia’s rich history with an awareness of contemporary standards of living. Under his policies, Essebi believes that the country is now committed to establishing equality and liberty, regardless of language, religion, gender or ethnicity.
“President Mebazaa has taken up this project and cared for it and set up a democracy. … The projects are not completed, but we have the institutions for that awareness of a democratic system,” he said.
For Essebsi, a solid institutional foundation is crucial for such a functioning democracy. Political objectives originating from this foundation include fair elections, formation and regulation of new political parties and reform of the judiciary. Essebi also hopes to encourage economic and educational growth.
Essebsi also emphasized that his government has no desire to intervene in the policies of other nations. However, he hopes that the revolutionary spirit of the Arab Spring will arise in surrounding countries, as it already has in Libya and others across the Middle East.
“The breadth of freedom has no borders,” Essebsi said. “Revolutions do not respect the sovereignty of nations.”
He added that remaining open to freedom and change will decrease the potential for violent insurgencies in the future.
While students appreciated Essebsi’s sentiments, some felt that his ambitions and explanations of the Tunisian revolution were not entirely pragmatic.
“I thought it was really good. It was just very idealistic,” Yomna Sarhan (SFS ’14) said.
Others felt that Essebsi’s arguments did not fully address the context and possible effects of the Arab Spring.
“A lot of his speech and a lot of what the government is doing in Tunisia is to throw out nice terms to say that something is happening,” Patrick Deem (SFS ’14) said.

Halfway done, Georgetown University Student Association President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) and Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) have yet to face many of their greatest challenges.
While Meaney and Laverriere say they have accomplished many of the goals that they campaigned on, they plan to focus the second half of their term on an attempt to alter major university policies that directly affect student life.
“Our difficult things still lie ahead,” Meaney said. “These are issues that come up year after year after year. The only way to really give students a chance to improve them is if a wide-scale, major, well-thought-out, well-researched, well-argued campaign is centered around it. And that’s what we’re planning to do.”
Since being elected to their year-long term last March, the pair said they focused on building up a strong staff and a good working relationship with the administration, all the while expanding services offered to students.
 
Laverriere said that one of their biggest successes has been the launch of the Student Advocacy Office, which was key to the campaign platform of James Pickens (COL ’12) and Ace Factor (COL ’12) when they ran against Meaney and Laverriere last spring. Pickens and Factor are now co-directors of the office, which will provide guidance for students dealing with code of conduct violations.
Both Meaney and Laverriere identified Project Move-In, a program in which GUSA arranged for students, faculty and alumni to help new students arriving alone on campus, as one of the most memorable moments of their term.
“It was something that was a simple idea, but that you could argue has made the greatest difference on campus,” Laverriere said.
“We hung out with this kid until 3:30 [a.m.], and that was really profound,” Meaney said. “I think it was just cool that we got to be there on his first night when he didn’t have anybody.”
Amid the debate over the 2010 Campus Plan, Meaney said the executive team has also begun to play a new role as an advocate for the university in the surrounding community. Meaney writes a biweekly column for The Georgetown Dish, a local blog, and has testified at Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E meetings. On campus, he co-writes a column in The Hoya with Matthew Hoyt (COL ’12).
Adam Mortillaro (COL ’12), speaker of the GUSA Senate, said the pair — especially Laverriere, a former chair of the Finance and Appropriations Committee — had been instrumental in managing the Student Activities Fee Endowment Commission.
“Greg has been really helpful in that,” he said.
And although the team was unable to fund improvements to SafeRides shuttles, Meaney said that their input helped push the university to instate the new M Street bus loop.
“That, I think, is a huge one,” he said. “Because it’s something that we campaigned on pretty vociferously but then didn’t receive the funding to do it. We were a part of that conversation, so we’re very pleased to see that.”
Improving transparency and awareness of GUSA’s activities were also major parts of the duo’s campaign, but success on this front has been more mixed.
Laverriere said that they have stepped up use of Facebook and Twitter to keep students updated on their work, and initiated weekly office hours in The Midnight Mug.
“I’m not going to say it’s been overrun,” Laverriere said of the office hours, laughing. “Ideally Mike and I would like it if there were more people there, but understanding that it is what it is. It’s a good avenue that we’ll leave open for the rest of the semester because it holds us to being where anyone can come and approach us.”
Harry Xu (SFS ’15) said he vaguely remembered Meaney from a time the student association president spoke at New Student Orientation. For him, the blast emails keep him somewhat up-to-date about GUSA’s movements.
But other students said they still had little knowledge about the team’s recent projects.
“I’m pretty much completely uninformed,” said Isaiah Schulze (SFS ’12).
According to Meaney and Laverriere, one of their biggest pushes toward transparency has been the opening of the application process for members of their cabinet.
“We’ve been able to get 12 great people sitting in this room on Sunday that come from very different parts of campus,” Laverriere said. “In previous executives it was, you know, positions were generally not opened up, it was more of a ‘you helped me.'”
Now, cabinet positions are required to be advertised to the campus at large.
Todd Olson, vice president for student affairs, said he admired the way Meaney and Laverriere have brought a broader group into the fold.
“I’ve been very impressed by the quality of their work and the way they’ve empowered other students to become involved in GUSA,” he said.
But the pair said that many of the issues they feel are going to be most difficult to address still remain. In the past, executives have often allowed their momentum to die down during the second half of their term, but Meaney and Laverriere say they intend to break any such trends.
“We’ve gotten so much done, we’ve built up all this capital and now we’re trying to use our last, most successful efforts for these kinds of more challenging problems,” Meaney said.
Laverriere outlined the “three pillars” that will dominate the rest of the term: an upcoming report on student life, a review of the Access to Benefits Policy that governs operations of student organizations and a review of the Student Code of Conduct.
Meaney said he hopes that the strong relationship he and Laverriere have cultivated with the administration will allow them to make changes to the latter two focus areas — a goal that has floundered in previous administrations
“Those are pretty massive undertakings, and they’re undertakings that GUSA and other groups always try to have a substantive change on, that usually don’t go anywhere,” he said. “So what we’ve been doing is very quietly building a really strong argument based on quantitative and qualitative analysis for why the code of conduct and access to benefits regimes should be changed.”
The report on student life — an extensive document that will scrutinize Georgetown’s funding boards and compare aspects of student life on campus to those of peer universities — is expected to be completed by January. Laverriere said that they will present the completed report to Olson and University President John J. DeGioia, using it as the basis for their recommendations on changes to university policy.
“I can tell you that the administration will take everything very seriously,” Olson said of the report.
John Morris (COL ’13), deputy chief of staff for Meaney and Laverriere, said that although the final review will depend on the results of the report, a committee has begun to brainstorm aspects on the Student Code of Conduct that they think need revising.
“It’s something that we feel has needed to be done for a while,” Morris said.
The executive leadership said they plan to focus on a few key aspects of the code that they believe will make the greatest impact.
“You can’t have freshmen drinking in their dorms — we get that,” Meaney said. “But there are a lot of rules and regulations on how clubs can spend money, and how students can celebrate and how students can hang out that are really cumbersome.”
Although he acknowledges that revamping the Student Code of Conduct and the Access to Benefits Policy will not be easy, Meaney remains optimistic.
“We’ve really tried to show people that we can be a positive instrument for student life and a positive tool,” he said. “We have 150 [and] some-odd days left, and we’re going to keep trying to prove that to people.”

The first of several university-led forums for students to share their concerns about university services will kick off in Sellinger Lounge Wednesday at 5 p.m.
Chief Operating Officer Christopher Augostini will lead the forums as one of his first major acts in his new role. He proposed the forums as a way to gather greater student input on problems in the areas that he oversees, including auxiliary services, student housing, facilities and University Information Services, as well as the Department of Public Safety, which is overseen by Erik Smulson, vice president for public affairs.
“The goal is for there to be constant communication,” Augostini said.
The forums, which will be called Hoya Roundtables, will allow students to ask questions and discuss their experiences with Augostini and representatives from the various offices he manages.
Augostini felt that he wanted to get a greater sense of student concerns after moving from his old position as chief financial officer to his current spot over the summer.
After meeting with about 100 students over the summer, including leaders of many campus organizations, Augostini said that a few issues stood out to him. Many students expressed frustration over the way that work requests are handled through student housing. Others had suggestions about how to improve technology on campus.
In early September, Augostini and his team decided to hold open forums in order to get a wider range of responses. Along with the discussion slated for Wednesday, the university has developed an online survey for students to pick the issues that matter most to them and submit questions and comments.
Augostini said that if enough students raise the same issues, he hopes to find ways to work with the departments involved to make a change, or at least report back to students on their attempts.
“To the extent that we can’t do something, we have a responsibility to tell you why,” he said.
Augostini said he hopes to hold such discussions at regular intervals but added that the format may change depending on the results of the first few.
While Augostini acknowledged that many university services are not what draw students to Georgetown, he said he wants to emphasize a culture of service that will help support students and staff in their daily lives.
“We’re here to serve students and the administration,” he said.

In a Sept. 29 letter to the White House, 18 Catholic universities expressed their dismay with a new government mandate that would require access to contraceptives in each institution’s student health care plans.
Representatives of these colleges requested exemption from a stipulation in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ health care overhaul that would require all private health plans, including student plans provided by colleges and universities, to include contraceptives and abortion services. They wrote that this stipulation would force universities to adopt practices that contradict the Catholic Church’s strong opposition to contraceptives and abortion.
Though Georgetown’s administration was not involved with the writing of the letter, Carol Day, director of Health Education Services, said that the university supports Church doctrine.
“[Through] Student Health Services you cannot get contraceptives for birth control reasons, university policy might allow for contraceptives to be prescribed by SHS doctors for medical reasons, such as hormone adjustment,” she said.
According to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr, the university has opposed this type of legislation as a member of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities.
“AJCU has been engaged in initiatives to revise the implementation of the regulations as they pertain to religious institutions, and Georgetown is supportive of those efforts,” Kerr wrote in an email.
In a further move to oppose the legislation, the Cardinal Newman Society urged thousands of members to send comments to the Department of Health and Human Services opposing the change.
Katie Schmitz (COL ’13), former secretary of Georgetown University Right to Life and co-director of the Cardinal O’Connor Conference that the group runs with the Knights of Columbus, said she was content that the university was on board with the movement against these regulations.
“Georgetown is a Catholic institution … and I don’t think that students, many of whom are pro-life and Catholic, should have to pay for something that they are opposed to,” Schmitz said.
For Kelsey Warrick, vice president of H*yas for Choice, which supports abortion and reproductive rights, the reform laws might spur Georgetown’s health care services to take action.
“I think it’s a great program that they’re enforcing, but at the same time I feel that a lot of universities are already on that track,” she said. “I’d be interested to see how Georgetown reconciles its religious beliefs with the new law.”

About 20 Occupy DC protesters camped out in McPherson Square this week to take a stand against national political leadership.
The protests are an offshoot of Occupy Together, a loosely organized movement that began on Wall Street last month and has now expanded to 801 cities worldwide.
Though the protesters in McPherson Square are dedicated — a few have been there since Monday, carrying signs that read “We are the 99 percent” and “Occupy Together in peace” — they have yet to fully flesh out their goals .
“Although there is no clear list of demands yet, we are fed up with how the country is being run,” the group wrote on its website. “We would like to see a clear separation between politics and corporations, spread the wealth … and not use [taxpayers’ money] to fuel violence in the world.”
“They’re creating a stir and that’s the point,” said Codie Kane (COL ’12), who attended the protest on Thursday. “It should not be normal for this many people to be poor.”
Kane and six other protestors sat in a circle and discussed ways to improve their cause. Every evening at 6 p.m., the group holds a general assembly, in which protesters decide which “actions” — that is, rallies, marches and demonstrations — they will pursue.
On Wednesday, participants rode the Metro dressed in suits, monocles and top hats, some speaking in mock-British accents.
“We figured we’d go to the place where the 99 percent is and show them the 1 percent,” explained Adrian Parsons, an organizer on the “arts and street team,” which organizes the daily actions in which the growing group of protesters will participate.
But the movement’s efforts in the District may have suffered from a lack of leadership.
“I’m here as an observer. I’ve come to accept my role here is not in organizing,” Brett Nadrich (SFS ’12) said.
Parsons estimated that between 10 and 20 people attended the first few general assemblies, though fewer opted to sleep near McPherson Square overnight.
“We can’t actually camp here,” Parsons said, explaining that because the square is government property it is illegal to camp there overnight. Instead, a handful of protesters sleep on the peripheries of the park — under store awnings and on sidewalks — before returning to the grassy square in the morning.
Kane said that while she sympathized with the movement, she would not be sleeping overnight with the protesters.
“How do you live within the system and fight against it at the same time?” she said, adding that she wasn’t planning on skipping class and her part-time job to participate in the 24-hour-a-day protests.
Joe Knowles (COL ’12), president of Georgetown University College Republicans, said that these Occupy DC protesters are misguided in their critiques of capitalism and the economic system.
“They have no idea what they’re talking about to be quite honest,” he said. “They should spend time getting educated and getting jobs instead of pushing these ridiculous demands.”

Exploring the moral issues surrounding labor justice in the American agricultural system, the “Food Justice: Growing a Movement” talk Tuesday aimed to shed light on the poor working conditions within the food industry.
Held by the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor in the ICC auditorium, the presentation featured speakers Barry Estabrook, author of “Tomatoland,” and Greg Asbed and Gerardo Reyes, both members of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers. The coalition works to promote fair labor practices for the workers in the production capital of the tomato industry, specifically for the Immokalee community in southern Florida.
Estabrook shared the discoveries he made about the tomato growing industry while conducting research for his book, describing working conditions that he said resemble a modern form of slavery. He detailed an environment where workers are exposed to pesticides nearly every day, earn far less than the minimum wage and do not receive worker benefits.
According to Estabrook, the migrant workers have earned essentially the same wage for the last 30 years. Paid by the amount of produce they pick, they earn 50 to 60 cents for every 32-pound bucket of tomatoes. Asbed explained that such labor conditions are the result of increasing consumer demand for vegetables.
“There is a steady downward pressure from corporations who relentlessly want to cut prices,” he said. With ever-tightening budgets and the rising cost of farming equipment, the growers’ only option is to tighten their budgets by cutting wages.
CIW has made strides in improving labor treatment for the workers at Immokalee, particularly through their “Penny More Per Pound” initiative. For every additional cent food purchasers pay per pound of tomatoes, worker’s earnings can increase by 32 cents per bucket. Added up, the new wages nearly equal minimum wage.
Through this campaign, CIW has established a system where the buying power of companies keeps the farmers’ treatment of the workers in check. Participating companies choose to buy from those farms that employ just practices. The coalition is currently planning to target supermarkets to join their initiative. CIW has already succeeded in gaining the support of fast food chains, such as Taco Bell, McDonald’s and Burger King, as well as Aramark, Georgetown’s food service provider.
“This is the first time the community is seeing the changes they’re pursuing,” Reyes said. “Abuses will continue, but a system is now in place to punish and identify the abusers and extract them from the system.”
Thomas Scharff (COL ’12), co-leader of this year’s Alternative Spring Break trip for Imokalee Migrant Worker Justice, also spoke passionately about fair labor practices.
“There is no one answer to this issue, and it’s important to hear the different sides and see the potential for change,” he told The Hoya. “Students need to understand that the consumer holds a lot of power. We need to be engaged with the issue and realize we can change the markets.”
Reyes and Asbed ultimately hope that raising awareness of the conditions of agricultural labor in Immokalee can eventually change the relationship between the laborers and their bosses.
“We have always had the same dream — imagining life where we are treated with dignity and are not invisible to society”, Reyes said. “This dream gives meaning to our existence and our humanity. Change is unavoidable.”

In an effort to support the District’s bikers, the D.C. Police Complaints Board put forward recommendations last Thursday aimed at improving the Metropolitan Police Department’s bicycle-law enforcement.
According to The Washington Post, the Complaints Board looked into the MPD’s bike policies after repeated complaints from D.C. residents and local biking organizations.
“We’ll frequently see citations for illegal passing or hazardous driving or riding abreast [in which] the cyclist is doing exactly what they should be doing. But because the officer may not be familiar with the way the laws apply to a bicyclist, then they cite the bicyclist,” Shane Farthing, executive director of Washington Area Bicyclist Association, told the Post.
The board recommended that MPD address these problems by designing more detailed collision reports and allowing officers extended time to investigate bike accidents. They also suggested offering officers more complete training on bicycle law enforcement.
Sven Beer (MSB ’15) said that he hopes a more effective training will make riding around the Georgetown shopping district safer.
“You develop some nice skills dodging cars on M Street,” he said, adding that he is often concerned by the lack of consideration D.C. motorists show for bicyclists. “I’ve seen some road rage. In my experience, I’ve been knocked off the shoulder of roads and cut off by cars.”
