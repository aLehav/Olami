Students gathered Friday on Healy Lawn in a show of support for civil discourse, responding to radio host Rush Limbaugh’s disparaging comments about a Georgetown Law Center student earlier this month.
The event was prompted by Limbaugh calling Sandra Fluke (LAW ’12) a “slut” and a “prostitute” after she advocated that employers’ health care plans include coverage for contraception at a meeting of the House Democratic Steering Committee and University President John J. DeGioia’s resultant letter promoting respectful public dialogue.
The Stand for Civility was run by a loose coalition group of 20 student organizations, according to the event’s leader, Jordan Daniels (SFS ’13).
“We were really happy about the diversity of the organizations that signed on,” she said, and added that the group had been working since spring break to organize the event.
Georgetown University Student Association President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) opened the event by echoing DeGioia’s message.
“Whatever side of the healthcare debate you’re on, it’s important to be articulate,” she said.
Gustafson was followed by Daniel Solomon (SFS ’13), the student director of Georgetown’s chapter of STAND: A Student Anti-Genocide Coalition. He spoke about the importance of endorsing women as members of the community and outlined important questions for engaging responsibly in public discourse.
“Can you understand where I’m coming from? Can I understand where you’re coming from, and can we approach each other with dignity and respect?” he asked.
The final speaker was Emma Green (COL ’12), a resident of the Body Positive house on Magis Row and a member of the Philodemic Society, who stressed the larger implications of the recent controversy over the provision of contraception.
“This is an issue about women, but ultimately this is an issue about debate,” she said.
An Open Letter from the Students of Georgetown University, which supports civil discourse, was also drafted by the event’s organizers and posted to change.org. It had received 167 signatures at press time.
Students in attendance said that promoting civility is a cause with widespread support.
“People know we need dialogue about these issues,” James Saucedo (MSB ’13) said. Event organizers asked students to write one of their personal principles on a balloon as the event drew to a close. Meghan Ferguson (COL ’15) and many other wrote “respect.”
“[The kind of language used by Limbaugh] is so counterproductive. It accomplishes nothing,” Ferguson said. “You can’t have equality without respect.”

Internet pioneer and venture capitalist Ted Leonsis (COL ’77) spoke about entrepreneurship and the importance of empathy to his business success Friday evening.
His talk in Reiss Friday was part of Students of Georgetown, Inc.’s 40th Anniversary Celebration.
Leonsis owns the Washington Wizards, Mystics and Capitals and is the founder of SnagFilms, a website that streams independent documentaries. He also started media company RedgateCommunications, and became a senior executive at America Online when Redgate was acquired by the corporation in 1994.
Lenonsis’ first business venture was a snow cone stand that he launched as an undergraduate in 1976. After graduating, he briefly worked for a consumer technology company before founding a software firm that sold for $70 million when he was 24 years old.
Leonsis said that his rapid success led him to briefly lose his way and begin questioning his values. He had an epiphany, however, after surviving a plane crash in 1983.
As the airplane was falling, Leonsis prayed and negotiated a deal with himself.
“If I get through this, I promise I’ll live the rest of my life without regret. I’ll try to find my own way, and I’ll leave more than I take,” he remembered thinking.
Surviving the crash inspired Leonsis to make a list of 101 things that he hoped to accomplish during his lifetime. So far, he has fulfilled 76 of them.
Leonsis encouraged prospective entrepreneurs to actively participate in several communities and underscored the importance of social interaction and self-expression.
He also cited personal empathy as a key to his success. Leonsis said he came off self-absorbed in an interview with the Washington Post after purchasing several of the District’s professional sports teams. He responded by apologizing to the staff of Verizon Center and cleaning the women’s restrooms and pickup up garbage after entertaining President Barack Obama at a Washington Mystics game.
“It’s almost two years later. … Not a single person has said to me, ‘Remember when you hung out with the president of the United States?’ But every single person remembers that I apologized, I said I was wrong and I cleaned the women’s bathroom,” Leonsis said.

Student organizations are bringing a new ballgame to the Kenilworth neighborhood in Northeast D.C. in an effort to build community through sports.
D.C. Reads, which had long been tutoring at Kenilworth Elementary, had tried to renovate the neighborhood’s Little League field last spring, but it soon became clear that the project required a longer-term commitment.
In the fall, Students of Georgetown, Inc.’s Service and Outreach Committee became involved with the Kenilworth Recreation Center.
CSOC has funded and designed basketball jerseys for teams at the recreation center and organized a group outing of Georgetown students to watch the Kenilworth team play. Committee members will also be planting flowers, landscaping and painting a mural at the recreation center Friday as part of The Corp’s 40th anniversary celebration, and they also plan to hold an event celebrating the community in mid-April.
“We see building a relationship with the coaches and student-athletes of Kenilworth as just as important as delivering on projects like providing jerseys and improving athletic facilities. It’s about connecting to those to whom we’re giving,” Committee Chair Will Cousino (SFS ’12) said.
The committee’s main goal this semester has been to renovate the local baseball field.
“Community members believed that a baseball diamond could become an epicenter of Kenilworth,” said D.C. Reads Coordinator Hannah Klusendorf (COL ’12), who was also a member of CSOC.
For committee member and project leader Alexandra Rallo (COL ’15), the partnership between The Corp and the Kenilworth neighborhood is a means for the company to include other student groups, like Hoyas for RBI, in its outreach and service projects.
Hoyas for RBI, a new Georgetown branch of Major League Baseball’s Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities program, seeks to mentor children through the game of baseball.
“D.C. RBI draws from the Kenilworth community and the surrounding area, and we are excited about the opportunity to work with The Corp to help out there,” Hoyas for RBI Founder and President Alexander Frawley (COL ’12) said.
According to Klusendorf, the collaborative aspect of this project makes it unique.
“Service and outreach imply this intersection of people and ideas,” she said. “When we, Hoyas — in all of our diverse talents, skills and even weaknesses — come together, we can do big things, things bigger than ourselves.”
