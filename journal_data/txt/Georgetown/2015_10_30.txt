A quarter-century ago, the university founded the Georgetown University Women’s Center in a converted Leavey Center storage closet with the goal of providing “a safe environment while respecting all facets of women’s abilities, spirituality and differences,” according to its mission statement. 
This October marked the 25th anniversary of the GUWC, which has provided resources and a platform for dialogue on female education and empowerment to the community since its inception.
The GUWC celebrated its anniversary with a reception at the Healey Family Student Center yesterday, where the center announced the creation of the Biondi Copeland Family Lecture Series, a set of discussions on women in higher education.
The lecture series was created through an unspecified donation by Gianna Biondi (CAS ’85) and John Copeland (CAS ’84). Biondi and Copeland also established the center’s Biondi Copeland Family Fund in 2014, which has contributed to the center’s programming and initiatives.
“This series will allow us to provide visibility for women presidents, provosts, faculty and student affairs professionals to share their stories and to work with our students and our community,” Director of the Women’s Center Laura Kovach said. 
University President John J. DeGioia praised the GUWC for its contributions to female students and faculty at Georgetown over the past quarter-century.
“For 25 years, the Women’s Center has helped to celebrate and empower women on the Hilltop. Our office is deeply grateful to Laura and all of the staff at the Center for the work that they do every day to support our community,” DeGioia wrote in a statement to The Hoya.
The GUWC was founded in 1990, 21 years after the College began accepting female students. Since then, the center has provided resources, referrals and materials for female students and faculty on women’s health and wellness, sexual health, gender-based violence and various other topics. The center hires student employees to help with its operations.
The center has also created numerous initiatives including the Women Advancing Gender Equity fellowship, university-wide program on sexual assault dialogue “Are You Ready?” and yearly programming during Women’s History Month in March. WAGE fellows participate in training and leadership development on issues related to gender equity.
Since its founding in 2008, the WAGE program has seen more than 50 participants and has sent dozens of students to the National Conference for College Women Student Leaders, a national forum for college-age female leaders. Last March, the GUWC hosted two women’s leadership retreats at the School of Foreign Service in Qatar.
SFS-Q established a sister women’s center in 2010 to mark the 20th anniversary of the GUWC, which provides resource and programming to the SFS-Q campus. According to Kovach, the creation of the GU-Q Women’s Center was one of GUWC’s most significant accomplishments. 
“The center is doing amazing things and we have partnered on an annual women’s leadership retreat and other programming throughout the year,” Kovach said.
In recent years, the center has increased its work with Georgetown alumni, such as Biondi and Copeland, who have made donations to the center and spoke at its events.
According to Kovach, the increased funding has helped the center sustain and expand its educational and programming opportunities for students.
“We are able to send students to conferences, fully fund our WAGE program, host panels like ‘Women, Faith and Leadership,’ provide resources for a women’s retreat at our SFS-Q campus and bring great programs to campus like Elect Her,” Kovach wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The GUWC also plans to host its first main campus women’s leadership retreat next November with support from campus ministry.
Director of the LGBTQ Center Shiva Subbaraman addressed challenges that the GUWC may face as student identities and needs evolve. The GUWC often collaborates with campus groups such as the LGBTQ Center and the Cawley Career Education Center, 
“I think one of the struggles of the women’s center has been how to reinvent itself for the 21st century, when so many women students on this campus think they do not need the women’s center anymore,” Subbaraman said. “The ones who feel they need the center are the ones who either run into issues or challenges, or those who understand where institutionally they still do not have a voice.”
Mary Rogers (COL ’16), an undergraduate assistant at the GUWC, said that the center remains an integral part of campus culture.
“I think having a physical women’s center is part of the idea that there is a space for women [on campus],” Rogers said. “People are under the impression that the women’s movement has already occurred and we don’t need a women’s center anymore. … But I would say that the work is never done.”
Associate Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Jeanne Lord, who initially served as an advisory board member of the center, said the center plays an important part in Georgetown’s culture. Lord is currently a supervisor of the center.
“The center has grown and evolved in response to the changing needs of women on our campus and in the world, but has always been an important resource for all Georgetown women,” Lord wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The center is rooted in our Jesuit and Catholic mission, so cura personalis, or care for the whole person, mind, body and spirit, is a foundational value.”
For the center’s future, Kovach said that they will continue to expand their initiatives in order to further engage the community.
“As we look ahead, we hope to continue our efforts to institutionalize all of our programs, increase our staffing resources and be that place for students to find engagement and education on important issues at Georgetown,” Kovach said. “It’s how we honor the students, faculty and staff who came before us.”

“The center is rooted in our Jesuit and Catholic mission, so cura personalis, or care for the whole person, mind, body and spirit, is a foundational value.”
This quote from Jeanne is a joke, right?
Also, you got the name of the center wrong.  It’s the Georgetown University Feminist Women’s Center, or GUFWC.  It’s a hostile place (read: not a “safe space”) for women who are libertarian, conservative, Republican, or faithful Catholics.

Amazing accomplishment.  Great to have a place that responds to the ongoing and changing needs of women in the university.  Hats off!!!

Amazing accomplishment to create a center that responds to the broad and changing needs of the women in the Georgetown community.  Hats off.

@The Georgetown Academy
I think that’s an appropriate title for the center because we should all be feminists. Feminists fight for the equality of both genders.

In the 1973 horror film “The Exorcist,” a priest leaps from of a window and tumbles to his death down a towering staircase. These famous 97 steps, cemented in film history, are just steps away from the Car Barn.
The staircase, located at 3600 M St. NW and connected to Prospect Avenue, will be officially named and commemorated with a plaque from the city Oct. 30.
At the event, city officials will establish the famous steps as a cultural site in the District and name them “The Exorcist Steps.” The film’s screenwriter William Peter Blatty (C ’50), director William Friedkin, Mayor Muriel Bowser, D.C. Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) and University President John J. DeGioia will attend the evening event, beginning at 4 p.m. and ending with a screening of “The Exorcist” at the Healey Family Student Center.
Friedkin will sign memorabilia for attendees at 4 p.m. before the plaque is unveiled at 6 p.m. The Council of the District of Columbia will also present a ceremonial resolution that honors the filmmakers and location, marking Oct. 30 as “The Exorcist Day” in Georgetown.
American University Directory of Community Relations Andrew Huff initiated and organized the commemoration in collaboration with Dupont Festival, an organization that hosts activities in the greater Dupont Circle area.
The D.C. Office of Motion Picture and Television Development provided initial funds for the project, while Huff worked with Dupont Festival to raise $7,000 in donations from District residents to fund the project.
“We have people in the neighborhood and across the city who obviously see the value in publicly acknowledging this location, this film and this book, and the cultural significance, not only to the film world, but to our city and to the Georgetown neighborhood,” Huff said.
Huff said he was initially inspired to plan the event because he is passionate about horror films but especially because he loves “The Exorcist” and its relationship with the Georgetown area.
“This is where I bring people. When I have friends or family visiting D.C. I don’t take them to the monuments or the Mall or the Smithsonian. I take them to ‘The Exorcist’ steps,” Huff said. “And I just thought after all this time and all these years that it was important to commemorate them in some way.”
According to Huff, Friedkin was keen to participate in the commemoration.
“All I did was tweet William Friedkin and tell him that we have plans to commemorate the steps and was he interested,” Huff said. “And he responded immediately that he was interested in learning more. We took the conversation offline, and the more he learned, the more interested and excited he became.”
Blatty, who wrote “The Exorcist” after hearing about a case of exorcism from a class he took at Georgetown, said that he recalled the steps being “spooky and suspenseful” in an interview with USA Today.
In 2014, Blatty started a petition to the Vatican calling for Georgetown to be stripped of its Catholic and Jesuit labels, citing that the university did not uphold Catholic morals. The Vatican replied to Blatty in a letter refusing his request.
Evans said that the event is exciting for the mayor and other city politicians.
“This dedication of the Exorcist Steps is a great example of what makes Georgetown, Ward 2 and D.C. such a great mix of history, culture and community,” Evans wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I’m excited to attend the dedication, and I think it’s really brought the whole neighborhood together.”
According to D.C. Office of Motion Picture and Television Development Director Pharoh Martin, these types of events demonstrate the importance of film to the city’s culture.
“There’s a lot of things that Mayor Bowser and the city’s doing to try to elevate D.C.’s standing as a world-class film location. But this is one thing that we can do that we’ve had in our backyard for many, many years that just had its time due,” Martin said. “We really should have already recognized this set of stairs, but it’s getting recognized and hopefully this isn’t the last film location that receives this kind of significance [in] the city.”
Huff expressed hope that the commemoration will draw attention to the impact “The Exorcist” has had on the D.C. film industry
“[People will] be able to look at our plaque that’s going to be installed at the bottom of the steps,” Huff said. “They’ll see that the District of Columbia recognizes the importance of the film industry, the entertainment industry in the city and the iconic nature of these steps and this location.”
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly identified American University Director of Community Relations Andrew Huff as William Huff.

“Vatican replied to Blatty in a letter refusing his request.” This statement is completely false. The Vatican’s reply was that Blatty had a “well-founded” case and it was undertaking a remedy in consulation with the Jesuit Order. If you want to pretend to be a newspaper, get your facts straights.

On the morning of Oct. 25, runners stood on the road between Arlington National Cemetery and the Pentagon, poised to begin a 26.2 mile race through the District.
Carleigh Douglas (MSB ’16) stood among them, watching in awe as Marine Corps officers parachuted out of the sky holding American flags. Surrounding her were more than 30,000 runners — including several Georgetown students — from all 50 states and 54 different countries.
At the sound of the start gun, runners leapt into action, kicking off the 40th Annual Marine Corps Marathon.
The marathon was the culmination of a weekend of activities that lasted from Oct. 23 to 25, consisting of a Health and Fitness Expo, Kids Run, 10K Run, pep rally and Runners Conference.
Douglas said the MCM was something she wanted to complete before leaving presence throughout the race inspiring, including the “Blue Mile,” a stretch in the middle of the course lined entirely with signs and flags in memory of Marines that were killed in action.
Douglas also spoke about how the injured participants inspired her throughout the race.
“I was really inspired by the people who were both wheeling themselves and being pushed by others,” Douglas said. “The times I was running with them were such amazing moments.”
The MCM was Sara Margolis’ (COL ’16) first marathon, although she has participated in half marathons and 10-milers sponsored by the army and the Marine Corps in the past.
Margolis spoke fondly of her experience. She said friends cheered for her on along the way, some of them jumping in to run small sections of the race with her for support.
“I love races in D.C. that benefit the military, and it is also the most fun and beautiful place to run,” Margolis said. “I would love to do it again every year from here on out if I’m in D.C.”
Margolis said that one of the reasons she loves doing military races is that she hopes to join the Judge Advocate General’s Corps, the legal branch of the military. She also highlighted the sense of camaraderie she felt throughout the marathon and praised the organization of the race.
“It is a well-oiled machine,” said Margolis, “They know exactly how far apart to put different mile times and they’ve got everything down to a formula.”
Professional runners sponsored by the organization ran at specific places to motivate the marathoners and run with them if they wanted to finish at a certain time.
Michael Saxon (MSB ’18) said the size of the race was intimidating at first, but emphasized the marathon’s sense of community and focus on veterans and the military.
“There wasn’t a big stretch of time during which there wasn’t a stranger cheering me on,” Saxon said. “Everyone was very supportive and a lot of people had signs. You made it because there were so many people around you doing the same thing and so many people in it all for the same goal.”
Saxon also said it was difficult training for a marathon while juggling schoolwork and other commitments.
“I would see myself doing another one in a couple of years,” Saxon said. “It was definitely worth it, but I don’t know if I want to do it again while I’m in college.”
Georgetown Triathlon Team Captain Aaron Lewis (MSB ’16), a former staff writer for The Hoya, also ran and said he was struck by the positive atmosphere and how the course of the marathon involved running through so many different parts of D.C.
“The course definitely showcased D.C.,” Lewis said. “It started in Arlington so you could see the back of the city and had parts where you ran under the Kennedy Center, past the Lincoln Memorial, along the Mall, into Georgetown and finally finished at the Iwo Jima Memorial.”
Megan Wallace (COL ’17) ran as a “Fundracer” for Back On My Feet, an organization she learned about through the Georgetown University Running Club. The nonprofit organization promotes the self-sufficiency of homeless people by engaging them in running to build confidence and strength.
“I am proud to say I beat my fundraising goal, achieved my goal of finishing in under four hours (my time was 3:45) and sprinted up the final hill across the finish line (my own personal goal),” Wallace wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I would really recommend the experience to anyone who is toying with the idea — you are always stronger than you think you are.

Cyrus Reza II Pahlavi, the head of Iran’s deposed House of Pahlavi, visited Georgetown to discuss misconceptions regarding the recent nuclear deal in light of the evolving political situation in Iran in the Intercultural Center on Wednesday.
The International Relations Club sponsored the lecture, titled “American-Iranian Relations Following the Nuclear Agreement.” The lecture came at a time of international media attention on United States-Iran relations after Iran reached an agreement with the United Nations Security Council and the European Union on its nuclear program in July.
Terrence Boyle (SFS ’63), an alumni leader of the Delta Phi Epsilon Fraternity and a former attorney, helped organize Pahlavi’s visit to campus. Boyle said that Pahlavi’s visit would draw attention to the increasingly important role Iran will hold in the near future.
“The evolving situation with Iran and its relationship with the [United States] will affect all our lives down the road,” Boyle said. “It is in our own interests, as Americans and Georgetown students, to understand and care about this evolving political situation.”
The speech was Pahlavi’s fourth address at Georgetown. Pahlavi, whose daughter graduated from Georgetown two years ago, was originally scheduled to only visit DPE members to celebrate the fraternity’s 75th anniversary, although IRC later chose to secure a larger space for the general public.
Pahlavi has remained in exile from Iran for more than 35 years. Though he was only 18 when the Islamic Revolution took place, his exile has only empowered his activity in Iranian politics and affairs. In his discussions on the media, Pahlavi continues to push for a secular, democratic Iran, and his motivations have helped inspire the formation of the National Council of Iran, a government in exile comprised of 40 parties and associations dedicated to influencing Iran’s political climate.
In his speech, Pahlavi focused primarily on Iran’s civilian population and how it is silenced by the government. He consistently spoke about the need to bring a nonviolent, concrete change in the region.
“If change is to occur in Iran, it has to occur by means of civil disobedience and nonviolence,” Pahlavi said. “All these years my position has been to encourage change driven by the Iranian people themselves. They are the only ones who can shift the balance of power.”
Pahlavi also argued how even in light of successful U.S.-Iran negotiations, the situation has not improved for Iran’s civilians. Pahlavi highlighted the United Nations Journal of Human Rights, which estimates that the regime currently imprisons and executes more citizens on an annual basis than during any other era.
“Despite all the hardships and difficulties, Iranians have become far more resilient in their civil disobedience against the regime,” Pahlavi said. “The population has become more organized and continues to protest much of the actions of the regime in power.” 
Pahlavi also criticized the strategy of U.S. policy makers and diplomats. He argued that much of the dialogue between both Iran and the United States focuses only on the regime of Iran and its demands. Pahlavi said the majority of the population is often left out in the common discourse, which is not conducive to actual progress against the regime.
“In my 35 years in politics, any dialogue with Iran and the outside world is limited to the regime’s representatives,” Pahlavi said. “I’ve met no U.S. government official who has themselves attempted to interact with any Iranian civilians, and only by interacting with the country’s true representatives can we all gain a greater understanding of their situation.”
Toward the end of his remarks, Pahlavi made a final call for the end of the current Iranian regime. He said that the current struggle is hardly one of religion, but of values. According to Pahlavi, the only way to ensure the success of democracy, liberty and equality is through the empowerment of Iranians who continue to suffer every day.
“This struggle is a question of values,” Pahlavi said. “When we stand for the values that have fueled our own human progress, and when we bring the needs of [Iranians] to the forefront … then we are taking the right steps to destroy this regime.”
While Pahlavi highlighted the importance of empowering democratic activists and parties within Iran, some students said that they wished he had focused more on the specifics of those groups, how successful they have been and whether there is hope for their continued empowerment.
IRC Director for Academic Programming Matthew Ellison (SFS ’18), who moderated the conversation with Pahlavi, said that he believes the significance of the Shah’s visit lies in the outside perspective Pahlavi brings to discourse on Iran and its complex political climate.
“He is bringing a perspective on Iran that we don’t hear very often, especially from the media,” Ellison said. “You don’t always hear elite Iranian voices that talk about democracy and reform, and that alternative narrative made His Excellency’s visit very exciting.”
Zoe Sun (SFS ’18), who attended the event, said that she also wanted to hear more from Pahlavi on how democracy might be realized in Iran.
“I wish he touched more upon the groups within the country trying to take power and institute democracy,” Sun said. “If there is going to be a democracy in Iran one day, or even a large scale political movement, which groups within the country are working towards that goal now? Who should we be paying attention to? Those are the questions he should’ve tried to address.”
Correction: An earlier version of the article stated that DPE co-sponsored the event. DPE hosted an event with Pahlavi following the speech.

The Office of Residential Living and the Division of Student Affairs clarified their policies against hanging banners, flags and clothing outside windows and chalking on buildings in two university-wide emails this month, the former of which prompted concerns over their infringement on the Speech and Expression Policy.
In an email dated Oct. 22, Vice President of Student Affairs Todd Olson said that recently, there have been more instances of chalking on inappropriate locations, such as campus buildings.
“There has been an increase in the number of instances of chalking on buildings, resulting in the need for more frequent removal and maintenance,” Olson wrote. “This damages and degrades campus buildings.”
According to the email sent by the Office of Residential Living on Oct. 20, banners, flags and clothing cannot hang outside any window of a university-owned residential facility, including student room and apartment windows.
Director of Residential Education Ed Gilhool said the ban on hanging items outside of building windows is consistent with the posting and window display policy that Georgetown has had in place for over seven years.
“Students are permitted to display items from within their rooms, visible to the outside, so long as they are consistent with the university’s speech and expression guidelines,” Gilhool said. “Hanging or placing items outside of windows is first and foremost a safety concern.”
Georgetown University Student Association Secretary for Free Speech Sam Kleinman (COL ’16), who is one of three students on the Speech and Expression Committee, said the ban is a violation of students’ freedom of expression.
“I don’t see any compelling reasons regarding safety to ban hanging things from windows,” Kleinman wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Kleinman encouraged students who are told to remove anything hanging from their windows to send a complaint to the Speech and Expression Committee.
The Speech and Expression Policy makes one reference to windows, under a section entitled “Exterior Flyers and Marketing.”
“Materials may be posted only on walls (not windows and doors) and only in designated areas,” the policy reads.
Olson’s email, which outlined the university policy on chalking in Red Square, reiterated that while chalking is allowed on the brick pavers, it is not permitted on the exterior walls of campus buildings under the Speech and Expression Policy.
According to Olson, the policy and the recent emails do not violate students’ freedom of expression.
“I believe this policy respects students’ rights to free expression, because there are plenty of places to chalk on the ground, and also places to post flyers [and] signs around campus,” Olson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Several offices collaborate to manage this policy, including the Division of Student Affairs, the Office of Planning and Facilities Management and the Office of the Provost.
This email was prompted in part by a recent incident in which Georgetown for Bernie, a student group in support of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chalked the outside wall of the Intercultural Center with slogans in support of Sanders.
Co-chair of Georgetown for Bernie Caleb Weaver (SFS ’16) said that the group had violated the Speech and Expression Policy.
“This slip-up was totally our fault,” Weaver wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We assumed it was ok to chalk there and encouraged the members to do so. We didn’t know it was against the Speech and Expression Policy.”
According to the policy, chalking in inappropriate locations or with the wrong type of material that results in damage to university property will require restitution from the responsible party.
Weaver said that while the group has not received a specific response from the administration regarding the chalking, it regrets the mistake.
“We apologize profusely for making more work for the facilities workers,” Weaver wrote. “We’ll avoid the error going forward.”
Kleinman said that he agreed with the chalking policy.
“Because a building could be damaged if everyone chalked the edifice often, it’s fairly reasonable to ban folks from chalking on buildings,” Kleinman wrote.
The Speech and Expression Policy was created in 1989 in response to an increased spate of bias-related incidents. It was written by Rev. James Walsh, S.J., who died this July.
Since 1989, the policy has been periodically revised by the Speech and Expression Committee. This group is comprised of four undergraduate students, one graduate student, appropriate staff from the Division of Student Affairs and four faculty or academic administrators.
The committee advises the vice president for student affairs and makes decisions regarding amendments and clarifications on the policy. It also reviews complaints and refers them to a sanctioning body.
The university’s stance on chalking dates from the document’s creation and has remained largely unchanged with the exception of a memorandum in 2014.
Kleinman said that most issues regarding free speech in the past have been caused by the policy’s enforcement rather than its actual content.
“For the most part, the policy is reasonable in its restrictions of speech,” Kleinman wrote. “It does not differ significantly from the rights you have on municipal property.”

More than 80 colleges — including all eight Ivy League schools, Stanford University, the University of Chicago, the University of Michigan and the University of Virginia — formed the Coalition for Access, Affordability and Success in late September to provide an alternative to the Common Application. Although Georgetown’s Office of Undergraduate Admissions was part of the initial discussion, Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon said Georgetown will continue to use its separate application system, explaining that the coalition makes applying to colleges more complicated and less helpful to low-income students.
The coalition is developing a new admissions application that it plans to launch in January. Universities will accept both the Coalition Application and the Common Application. The new site will contain three components — an online “locker” portfolio, a collaboration element and an application portal. The locker will store material from high school courses, accessible for students starting in ninth grade. Students can share selected documents with teachers, counsellors and mentors through the collaboration platform. When students begin the application process, they can attach materials from their lockers to submit to colleges. 
According to a coalition press release from Sept. 28, the purpose of familiarizing students with the process at an early age should minimize stress during the actual application process and provide a counseling resource for low-income applicants.
“In creating this platform, these colleges and universities hope to recast the college admission process from something that is transactional and limited in time into a more engaged, ongoing and educationally reaffirming experience,” the coalition wrote in the press release. “They also hope to motivate a stronger college-going mindset among students of all backgrounds, especially those from low-income families or underrepresented groups who have historically had less access to leading colleges and universities.”
However, critics of the coalition argue it will complicate instead of improve accessibility for low-income students. Deacon said he was a part of the original discussions exploring the idea of the coalition after technical complications with the Common Application arose in October 2013. However, the coalition evolved with more expansive ideas than Deacon originally considered.
“We were interested in the discussions, only because we thought it could end up being a very small group of schools that essentially are highly selective and may therefore have a different set of questions that they want to ask than say, the University of Maryland might want to ask,” Deacon said. “But now they’ve taken it and run with it a bit. Where they’ve run is in somewhat questionable territory.”
Deacon said he believes the coalition is overstating its ability to help low-income students, citing its complicated three-part format.
“I think that they’re overlying it with the intention to help low-income students but that’s not really what it’s all intended to do,” Deacon said. “It could be that that would work. But right now, it doesn’t seem like it would — obviously because it’s actually a more complicated application rather than a simpler one.”
Brian Taylor, director of Ivy Coach, a New York-based business that assists students in the admissions process for highly selective schools, considers the coalition detrimental to the admissions process.
“We think that the Coalition for Access is a mistake, and we think that the colleges that agreed to be part of the coalition agreed to that very prematurely,” Taylor said. “The coalition itself is half-baked. There are so many parts of the coalition that don’t even make sense.”
Although Taylor acknowledged that the coalition would likely benefit the private college counseling business, he stressed that underprivileged students often do not have access to private college counselors.
Taylor said the coalition’s program for college applications contradicts its stated goals of helping low-income students. 
“The whole objective of the coalition is to improve access for underrepresented minorities and for low-income students. And that’s great. Lots of colleges, lots of highly selective ones, love that. Georgetown, of course, wants to appeal to disadvantaged students and to people who come from high schools where they don’t actually have great college counselling,” Taylor said. “But, the proposal for the coalition doesn’t address that at all. In fact, it does the complete opposite.” 
However, coalition spokesperson Marielle Sainvilus maintained that the program is specifically designed to instill a college-centered mindset in low-income students as a means of helping them in the admissions process. 
“One of the things we do want to say is that we are committed to providing students with the best possible college experience,” Sainvilus said. “The research is clear for low-income and underrepresented students that earlier engagement and being part of a college-going culture is critical to their success in the college admissions process.”
Georgetown Scholarship Program Director Missy Foy (COL ’03) also raised concerns about the pressure that could arise from the emphasis of the process on an early start.
“I fear that this new application process, where students can begin building a portfolio in 9th grade, could perpetuate that stress and start it even sooner,” Foy wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Meanwhile, low-income students may not utilize it.”
In order to qualify for the coalition, public universities must have need-based financial aid for in-state residents and private institutions must meet the full, demonstrated financial need of admitted students. Colleges in the coalition are also required to have a six-year graduation rate of 70 percent or more, a condition Georgetown would meet.
The majority of the schools that have joined the coalition are not need-blind, meaning they take into account a student’s financial aid needs when determining admission. Georgetown’s need-blind admission process considers applicants without regard for their ability to pay, and provides a full financial aid package for each admitted student’s demosntrated need. 
Deacon said these colleges in the coalition are not fully committed to assisting low-income students.
“There’s kind of a hypocrisy there where you’re calling this something for low-income when in fact, the schools that are in it actually give money to people who don’t need it and don’t meet the full need of those who do,” Deacon said. “They figure out a way to be inclusive but it really is a misnomer to think that these schools are all committed to meeting the full need of students.”
Deacon said Georgetown’s decision to abstain from the coalition is not an indication of any unwillingness to assist low-income students. According to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions website, the university’s financial aid packages include subsidized student loans, part-time student jobs and, if required, a scholarship to meet the remainder of student need. Georgetown has met full demonstrated need for domestic undergraduates for the past 30 years
The GSP provides support to 1789 Scholarship students through access to an alumni network, career and academic help, mentorship programs and campus support.
“The only reason that I even say anything about the low-income thing is that I don’t want people to think that we’re not interested in recruiting low-income students,” Deacon said. “In fact, we think that just the reverse is going to happen — that it’s going to be harder for low-income students applying to these schools because they’re making it more complicated.

The United Nations’ High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres called on the international community to collaborate on resolving ongoing refugee crises at the semester’s third Global Futures lecture in Gaston Hall on Wednesday. 
Guterres’ lecture, titled “Present and Future Challenges of Global Forced Displacement,” continued the Global Futures Initiative’s semester-long theme on “The Global Future of Governance” by addressing the threat the refugee crisis poses to global peace and security.
The discussion was the third installment in a series of lectures that began with a talk on governing fragile states led by School of Foreign Service Dean Joel Hellman in early September. The second, which took place in late September, featured World Health Organization Director-General Margaret Chan in a discussion on global health governance.
University President John J. DeGioia began the discussion by citing Pope Francis’ call to support the refugee community and said that everyone, especially members of the Georgetown community, has an obligation to help.
“The challenges we are facing today … we must respond to as a global community,” DeGioia said.
Vice President for Global Engagement Thomas Banchoff also said that Guterres’ mission aligns with the goals of the Global Futures Initiative.
“[We] look forward to finding out with the help of the high commissioner how to best grapple with future crisis as a university in the national and international community,” Banchoff said.
Guterres, who has led the U.N. refugee agency since 2005, began his lecture by describing the increasing gravity of the refugee crisis. The UNHCR was established in 1950 to safeguard the rights and well-being of refugees, and has since grown to a staff of more than 9,300 people in 123 countries.
“What has changed is not that the refugee problem has become all of a sudden much more dramatic,” Guterres said. “What has changed is that refugees, for the first time, have come in big numbers to the rich world.”
According to Guterres, the number of people around the world displaced by conflict and persecution is currently at its highest since World War II. Syria, the Central African Republic, Somalia and Afghanistan are all in the midst of large-scale humanitarian disasters.
Guterres said that strong, multilateral governance mechanisms must regulate migration.
“I think it is unacceptable that [a refugee] that wants to go from Egypt to Italy has to pay a smuggler $5000, but a tourist that wants to go from Egypt to Italy pays $50,” Guterres said.
Guterres said the U.N. should incorporate the International Organization of Migration and give it regulatory capacity to monitor the global labor market.
“Lack of capacity of the international community to prevent crises and to solve them timely is having terrible consequences in the humanitarian dimension,” Guterres said.
According to Guterres, the international refugee community has not only grown in number, but has also begun to enter developed European countries. Guterres stressed that, as public attention often dictates funding, it is important to view refugee crises holistically.
“It is absolutely essential to make people understand … all crises are interlinked, from Nigeria to Mali, from Mali to Libya, from Libya to Somalia,” Guterres said. “It is important to make sure that those [lesser-known] situations are not neglected.”
Following Guterres’ address, Georgetown’s Institute for the Study of International Migration Director Susan Martin joined the discussion and inquired Guterres about the role of the United States in addressing the global refugee situation.
Guterres said the country needs to greatly increase its humanitarian aid and serve as the leader of a global coalition that brings together key stakeholders in each crisis to deescalate conflicts.
“The resources available for humanitarian aid are out of proportion, negatively, to the existing needs,” Guterres said.
Guterres’ address was followed by a question-and-answer session with faculty, students and other members of the university community.
When a student asked about what Guterres perceives to be the most difficult international challenge in the future, Guterres spoke of the evolution of increasingly globalized conflict.
“The biggest challenge is the combination of facing growing needs … and more people affected,” Guterres said. “We have less resources and less access to [reaching] those people.”
Guterres called on the university to engage in this issue.
“[Georgetown should] join efforts with other areas of civil society … to move towards a system of global governance, of multinational connection,” Guterres said.
Jessica Li (SFS ’19), an attendee, said that Guterres’s talk was engaging and educational.
“I thought it was interesting how Guterres emphasized the importance of developing a more multilateral approach and working alongside financial institutions to help the internally displaced,” Li said.

Georgetown Spanish associate professor Adam Lifshey won the annual Africa-Asia Book Prize from the International Convention of Asian Scholars for his book on Spanish literature in Southeast Asia and West Africa.
Lifshey received the prize for his 2012 book, “The Magellan Fallacy: Globalization and the Emergence of Asian and African Literature in Spanish.” The Africa-Asia Book Prize, which was established by ICAS in 2013, is awarded annually to an exceptional scholarly work published in English, French or Portuguese since 2009 on any topic linking Africa and Asia.
In a statement published on their website, ICAS praised Lifshey’s book for its analytic approach to its topic.
“Through an insightful analysis of two marginalized literary traditions (the Philippine and Equatorial Guinean ones), ‘The Magellan Fallacy’ challenges ideas and concepts we often take for granted,” the statement read. “This is a work masterfully rendered, witty, original in its central thesis and seminal in its scope. A classic in the making.”
Lifshey received the award in a presentation ceremony held in Ghana from Sept. 24 to 26.
Lifshey said that winning the award exposed him to a wider community of scholars in his field.
“It was really a lot of fun and very meaningful,” Lifshey said. “I am used to working in isolation. … Suddenly there were hundreds of people from around the world in this wonderful country who were congratulating me on the book.”
Lifshey also said that he enjoyed the experience of participating in the award ceremony in Ghana.
“Everyone in Ghana was extremely nice to me and I really appreciated that,” Lifshey said. “It was a good opportunity to meet scholars from Africa and Asia that I wouldn’t normally have a chance to meet in a Spanish [or] Portuguese department.”
According to Lifshey, he was inspired to write the book after noticing the lack of available knowledge on Spanish literature in the Philippines and West Africa.
The title of Lifshey’s book is a reference to European explorer Ferdinand Magellan, who was killed in a battle with a native tribe in the Philippines during his mission to circumnavigate the globe for the Spanish Empire.
“I was always interested in things that my teachers didn’t tell me,” Lifshey said. “I realized … that there was some wonderful literature that I wanted to read and think about and write about.”
Chair of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese Gwen Kirkpatrick said that the department recognizes the significance of Lifshey’s work.
“The entire department was aware of the importance and originality of his research,” Kirkpatrick wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are very proud of his work and impressed with his success.”
Last year, Lifshey received a $266,000 grant from the Andrew W. Foundation for a study on literature in Taiwan and the Philippines.
Kirkpatrick said that Lifshey’s work explored a new field in Spanish post-colonialism.
“I am especially impressed by the work in the Philippines that is based on a great deal of archival research,” Kirkpatrick wrote.
According to Kirkpatrick, other fields of study at Georgetown could benefit from following Lifshey’s interdisciplinary approach in the future.
“It will bring attention to the presence of Spanish in parts of the world not usually associated with Spanish,” Kirkpatrick wrote. “It ties in the story of Spanish colonization to a worldwide system of commerce and exchange of goods and cultures through Asia to the Americas and then to Europe.”
Ross Karlan (GRD ’19), a student in Lifshey’s course, said the award was no surprise, given Lifshey’s enthusiastic and engaging nature as a professor.
“His passion for the subject matter was always apparent,” Karlan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “His research is very cutting-edge and new. … He is forging new paths for comparative literary studies that move beyond traditional canons. He has essentially become the master of a field that is relatively unstudied.”
Karlan said that he hopes this award will bring more attention to humanities at Georgetown.
“Adam’s award and research shows that we are a dynamic institution with faculty and students who break the norms and try new things,” Karlan wrote.
Lifshey said that the award has encouraged him to continue in this line of study. He will release another book on a similar topic in December.
“It is very exciting and I am very grateful that scholars of Africa and Asia appreciated the work that I tried to do in the book,” Lifshey said. “I hope that it leads to more work on literature in Spanish from Africa and Asia.”

A bipartisan coalition in the House of Representatives introduced a new amendment Oct. 20 to provide legislative approval of the Oct. 9 takeover of the Washington, D.C. Metro by Federal Transit Administration officials.
The “Protect Riders of Metrorail Public Transportation Act of 2015” would legally approve of U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx’s measures to take over the supervision of the D.C. Metro from the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. The National Transportation Safety Board requested that Foxx step in after it concluded that the current supervisor of Metro safety, the Tri-State Oversight Committee, is ineffective.
Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), Rep. Donna Edwards (D-Md.) and Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) are among the bill’s sponsors.
A January electrical malfunction that filled a Yellow line with deadly smoke, sending 84 to the hospital and killing one, sparked these measures. Foxx officially took over the D.C. Metro, explaining why in a letter to National Transportation Safety Board President Christopher Hart on Oct. 9.
“Increased oversight means that FTA will now directly enforce and investigate the safety oversight of WMATA Metrorail,” Foxx wrote. “FTA has the capability to assert this authority and, at my direction, will do so immediately.”
Comstock explained to The Hill that the Metro’s failure to conduct safety inspections has been an outrage and necessitated the federal takeover. The PROMPT Act, Comstock hopes, will allow passengers to feel at ease when commuting to or visiting Washington, D.C.
“The safety failures and the unreliability of Metro threaten our commuters and constituents daily,” Comstock said. “This bipartisan legislation reinforces and expands the U.S. Department of Transportation’s authority to conduct much-needed and direct oversight of Metro.”
Norton explained that the main goal of the legislation is to ensure Metro rider safety following poor oversight by the Tri-State Oversight Committee.
“This action will help protect riders,” Norton said. “FTA has the experience and background to conduct federal oversight of rail, including performing random inspections.”
Norton explained that continued federal oversight will occur until the District of Columbia, Virginia and Maryland create a new safety board that conducts routine inspections and identifies any risks to passenger safety. The D.C. Department of Transportation will continue to handle everyday operations under federal supervision.
“[T]he District of Columbia, Virginia and Maryland [must] develop a state safety oversight agency certified by the DOT Secretary,” Norton said. “The PROMPT Act authorizes the Department of Transportation to administer state safety oversight activities for WMATA Metrorail until [then].”
A DDOT spokesperson declined to comment.
Norton referenced the 2012 Moving Ahead for Progress Act, which gives the DDOT direct safety oversight of transit rail, as legal precedent for the federal takeover. With the introduction of the PROMPT Act, the FTA will be able to take over full responsibility for the Metro.
“Neither D.C. nor virtually any states have had time to set up a safety agency for rail, because authority was only granted to the states in 2012,” Norton said. “The original grant envisions state oversight, or, if necessary, FTA oversight.”
The WMATA Riders’ Union spokesperson Graham Jenkins explained that federal oversight of the D.C. metro is an encouraging step in reducing safety hazards. Jenkins said that almost everyone can agree that such action is necessary.
“The WMATA Riders’ Union welcomed Secretary Foxx’s original announcement of the FTA takeover of Metrorail safety oversight,” Jenkins said. “We continue to hope that the jurisdictions and WMATA will work together to establish an effective state safety oversight agency.”
The Riders’ Union had its first public meeting Oct. 29, where it discussed the need for changes in order to alleviate rider fears.
“The FTA [may] serve as a more capable guardian of rider safety,” Jenkins said. “[But] bold, sweeping changes are needed across the entirety of WMATA, and this is but a small step.”

The Religious Freedom Project at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs hosted a panel discussion Tuesday with media figures and experts on religious freedom about the increased intolerance toward religion-based and conservative viewpoints on college campuses.
The discussion in Copley Formal Lounge, which was entitled “Illiberal Liberalism? The Fate of Religious Freedom in the Public Square,” included panelists such as USA Today writer and Fox News contributor Kirsten Powers, sociology professor at Pitzer College Phil Zuckerman and Southern Baptist Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission President Russell Moore.
Associate Director of the RFP Timothy Shah, who moderated the panel, pointed out recent trends on the decline in freedom of speech in American society. Shah cited a recent Pew Research Center study, which shows that the United States’ restrictions on free expression have risen from ‘low’ to ‘moderate’ over the last six years, specifically with regard to religion.
“The fact that the U.S. is in the middle range of some 200 of the world’s countries is pretty shocking,” Shah said. “[The U.S. is] a country that traditionally prides itself on its respect for religious freedom … [and] ranked religious freedom as the first freedom.”
Shah asked the panelists what potential causes might be for what he described as a “crusade” against religious liberty, free expression and free speech. Shah suggested an answer by defining the phenomenon of illiberal liberalism, in which politically liberal activists aim to restrict politically conservative opinions.
“Are some self-declared liberals who are traditionally in the vanguard of defending rights to dissent … trying to close down debate rather than open it up?” Shah said. “The rights of unpopular groups to express unpopular opinions [have been lessened].”
Powers answered the question by speaking on the influence that campus speech censorship has on creating a culture of illiberal liberalism. She explained that conservative perspectives on issues such as abortion, the Affordable Care Act’s contracepation mandate and same sex marriage are dismissed and shut down.
“[Illiberal liberalism is] worse on college campuses; there’s no question about it,” Powers said. “But let’s remember where the people on campuses are going to end up. They’re going to end up in our culture.”
Powers, whose book, “The Silencing: How The Left is Killing Free Speech,” documents the trend among college students to be intolerant toward individuals who criticize or disagree with politically liberal principles, said that this prevailing attitude among college students has caused a larger intolerance in society.
“They are being taught at a lot of universities that certain views just are off-limits,” Powers said. “[These include] that you shouldn’t offend certain people, and it’s a one-way street … [But] it’s just certain people who can’t be offended.”
Powers attributed much of this ideology to a concept called liberal care ethic, which dictates that all political opinions should be based on providing for marginalized groups.
“Liberals have endorsed this idea of a care ethic where everything is about care for marginalized groups,” Powers said. “They’ve been imbued with this ideology which makes them more sympathetic when people complain.”
Zuckerman said he generally agreed with Powers’ diagnosis of campus speech culture, but directed certain criticisms toward Powers’ book, including what he perceived as the lack of sufficient statistics and data in place of anecdotal evidence. Zuckerman explained that Powers also neglected to point out the similarities between intolerant liberals and fundamentalists on the Christian right.
“Illiberal liberalism made me think of another thing that I would call the Christian right,” Zuckerman said. “I’ve read the teachings of Jesus, I read everything Jesus said and the Christian right violates that.”
Moore responded to Zuckerman by suggesting that while Christian Evangelicals may feed into the narrative of intolerance, the left is more responsible for hypocrisy because it defines popular culture on college campuses.
“I think that on college campuses, in order to really be identified as a progressive, free-thinking, forward-directed person, then you have to take on this sort of crusade,” Moore said. “[If not], you’re out of the tribe.”
Powers’ advice for students who feel that their ideas are being unfairly neglected is to continue to make their voices heard.
“Ideas aren’t dangerous. They’re not going to harm you. They’re words, and you can respond to those words with arguments,” Powers said. “I think it’s a real red flag if someone has to completely silence your point of view.”
Rob Kem (COL ’18), who attended the event, said that the debate was a model for future discussions between liberals and conservatives on free speech.
“It was really respectful. They disagreed, but they didn’t ever call an idea stupid,” Kem said. “They gave evidence and stated their arguments.”
Kem said that censoring free speech at college, no matter how controversial the matter at hand is, should not be tolerated.
“You always hear things in the news of people being disinvited to speak at colleges because of a specific viewpoint they have,” Kem said. “That’s antithetical to what a college should be where the best ideas will rise to the top naturally in the marketplace of ideas.”

Prominent Buddhist monk, author, photographer and humanitarian Matthieu Ricard shared his insights on the importance of human happiness and altruism to an audience of more than 300 people in Gaston Hall on Monday.
The former molecular biologist turned monk visited Georgetown as part of a global promotional tour for his latest book, “Altruism: The Power of Compassion to Change Yourself and the World.”
Ricard is renowned for his 2004 TED talk on happiness and altruism that has garnered more than 7 million views. He also participates in scientific research related to contemplation and founded the charitable organization Karuna-Shechen in 2000, which is currently committed to more than 140 humanitarian projects throughout Nepal, India and Tibet.
In University President John J. DeGioia’s opening remarks, he cited a quotation — “The world is our house” — from Jerome Nadal, a 16th-century member of the Society of Jesus, and said that altruism aligns with Georgetown’s Jesuit mission.
“This idea that the world is our house asks that we embrace a way of life that is welcoming, accepting and in solidarity with all those around us,” DeGioia said. “It asks that we take responsibility for the well-being of each other.”
Ricard began by offering his personal definition of altruism.
“[In] altruism … your primary motivation is to achieve the benefit of others or to remove their suffering,” Ricard said. “So altruism basically is a state of mind, it’s a motivation and an intention. Of course, it must be followed by action as much as possible.”
Ricard also said that he believes in what he calls “the banality of goodness,” which he defined as the view that all people are essentially good and behave well toward others.
“I think that we have to recognize that if we look at the vast majority of the behavior of 7 billion human beings most of the time … we behave in benevolent, decent, kind, polite and … cooperative ways,” Ricard said.
Ricard said that humanity currently faces many problems including widespread poverty, inequality and globalized environmental degradation.
“We are clearly facing major challenges,” Ricard said. “Here, we are at the edge of tipping points in many ways: our own life, societal life, inequalities that are growing throughout our cities and countries and the environment.”
Ricard also said that in his view, altruism is a practical solution to the problems that humanity faces in the modern world.
“The idea [of altruism] is not just a utopian, beautiful idea, but is the most pragmatic answer to challenges of our times,” Ricard said.
According to Ricard, widespread altruism could help overcome the world’s challenges by altering cultures, institutions and economies to achieve what he calls “sustainable harmony.”
“Sustainable harmony for today is [about] remediating … inequalities — [to bring about] more social justice,” Ricard said. “Sustainable harmony over time is to remain in harmony with our environment so that we continue in a sustainable way for the sake of future generations.”
Ricard said that to cause such far-reaching change, altruism must first be cultivated at the individual level through exercises such as meditation on compassion for others. According to Ricard, modern research indicates that meditation changes the structure and function of a practitioner’s brain, even to the level of gene expression, making them more amenable to compassion.
“If you cultivate the innerskill of love and compassion, definitely, you change,” Ricard said.
Ricard also said that a close-knit group of altruistic individuals could unite to change the community around them. Ricard said that this idea is based on the principle that only the smallest proportion is needed to effect change in a larger whole.
“It turns out that to reach opinion, you don’t need 90 percent of people or more than 50 to adopt an idea,” Ricard said. “If there is a strong idea with, say, 15 percent of people, who really make it the point. … Those who are undecided will shift to that and there is a change in culture.”
After Ricard’s keynote, the event included a conversation moderated by associate professor of psychology Abigail Marsh, a question-and-answer session and a book signing.
Daniel Marshall (SFS ’19) said the event was thought-provoking and inspired personal reflection.
“It was a totally distinctive point of view, which took me by surprise, and as a result I know I have some re-evaluating to do,” Marshall wrote in an email to The Hoya.
 
[…] I have been moved to tears by some of the anecdotes and information.  Ricard talks about the “banality of goodness”.  “We have to recognize that if we look at the vast majority of the behavior of 7 billion […]

Former University President Fr. Leo O’Donovan, S.J. headed the university from 1989 to 2001 — a time when free speech issues came to the forefront of university discussion. In 1991, pro-choice group GU Choice — which would eventually become H*yas for Choice — emerged at Georgetown, facing harsh opposition from both students and Catholic officials. The Hoya sat down with O’Donovan to discuss the intersection between free speech on campus and the university’s Catholic identity.
This is part three of a three-part interview. Parts one and two are available on thehoya.com.
What is your opinion on H*yas for Choice? The group — then called GU Choice — emerged during your presidency and started a debate about university recognition.
I continue to think that the Second Vatican Council correctly summarizes Catholic Moral Tradition in speaking of abortion as intrinsically wrong. But stating that principle does not yet address the reasons for the occurrence of abortions and how to reduce their number. I believe society is also obliged to help women who are pregnant and do not know how they can carry their child to term and take care of the child. Strong social policies should provide the medical help, educational opportunities and general support that can lead to reducing the incidence of abortions — which is after all the point, isn’t it? That’s put very generally, I know. But it’s still true that moral principles must be accompanied by moral practice.
It is also true that there are other problems in society that demand urgent address but are hard to identify as intrinsically wrong. And poverty, even in a country as wealthy as ours, is certainly a major one — because poverty also cripples and kills.
I also think that it is indispensable to recognize the full and true equality of women in society. In that regard, I consider myself a feminist. Most of my feminist friends who are women would say, “Not a very good one,” but that’s OK with me. Whatever they say, I still have to learn from them. But I firmly believe in the full equality of women. I believe that should be the case in the Catholic Church as well as in society at large.
I also believe in freedom of speech, and I believe that the suppression of speech is never helpful. Speech can be used in very irresponsible ways. I’d rather risk irresponsibility while allowing speech. Still, we all know that you don’t say things in the presence of children that you might say in the presence of an adult. And you don’t say things to adults that will be unproductive, unhelpful. This is an old moral tradition that you can tolerate ignorance in certain situations and let people live as they see best. I think that’s about what I’d say.
Even though official church doctrine says that abortion is intrinsically wrong, you believed it was important to have a conversation about it rather than condemn it because you believe in freedom of speech. Why is that?
Well, in a university situation I would always favor enabling a conversation in the company of wise faculty and wise moral and religious guides, rather than forcing that discussion underground. The university is a place where people learn to talk, and talk and talk, and I would suspect every student on the Georgetown campus knows that they learn things from their fellow students and they learn how to wrestle with things that they wouldn’t expect to learn from professors or books.
What do you think of the recent issues at Georgetown surrounding free speech? It seems that students are still continuing to push for a little more free speech. Do you think Georgetown has done enough?
I have absolute confidence in the president of the university, who is, I think, as clear minded and committed to the fundamentals of Catholic teaching and thought as one could be. [Vice President for Student Affairs] Todd Olson, whom I’ve know for years, has been in his position for a long time and clearly has the president’s confidence, so I certainly have no inclination to second guess him. I suppose I would say, as I think I suggested before, that freedom of speech bears its real fruit when men and women are helped to live fuller, truer human lives. Freedom is less about reducing restraint and much more about empowering life. I think that was one of the great lessons of the Civil Rights Movement.
People did not just argue for equality for black people, for the right to vote, for the right to work, for freedom from harassment. In practical ways they voted for people who would represent them well, worked together to renew neighborhoods, formed communities that were sustaining. That struggle was brilliantly presented in the recent show at the Museum of Modern Art, “Jacob Lawrence’s ‘Migration Series,’ and Other Visions of the Great Migration” of African-Americans from the South to the North. It’s not just about freedom, but it’s about living conditions, integrating schools, resisting environments that were in many respects as oppressive as the South had been.
But, as I suggested earlier, argument is of the nature of university life. There are times when I want to ask: What have you done recently to help somebody practically, in addition to assuring them free speech? Do you ever go to a soup kitchen? Have you ever visited a poor school? Have you ever helped to teach illiterate children? Or are you interested in medical help? Have you ever helped out in a clinic? Have you visited parts of the country — or outside the country — where people are desperately removed from the comforts of Georgetown?
When you arrived at Georgetown, how did you approach the endowment?
Well, it was clear that our endowment was not at all commensurate with our educational contribution and reputation. And what were the reasons for that? There was a lingering approach to financing the university that relied overly much on contributions from the Jesuit community and very traditional sources. We did not have a culture of serious professional philanthropy. Part of that was that it was not a part of incoming students’ appreciation of who they were and where they were. In fact, as soon as students become part of Georgetown they become also responsible for its future. Earlier, the percentage of annual giving was very low, and I think while I was president we moved that from something like 20 percent to about 32 percent. That’s my rough recollections. But to improve participation, every percentage is a big achievement; you’re dealing with very large numbers and a lot of communication. I’m very proud that the university continues to be committed to the need-blind, full financial aid policy. It is not a common policy. Several colleges on whose boards I sit couldn’t possibly do that. I think our president and his team are correct that it was a fundamentally indispensable commitment.
Indispensable because it meant we would be making the Georgetown education available for the very best students. Why have we not increased the endowment still more? Well, I would say, there are clear signs that we are increasing it and that prospects for increasing it to something more commensurate with our stature are very strong. Gifts like the McCourt gift are not just fortunate, but signs. I think it was [Theodore] Hesburgh who said the hardest thing is raising the first billion and after that it becomes — I don’t know if he said easier, but something like easier.
So, it’s a matter of keeping at it. As I indicated before, I always thought that we should let our students know as soon as they arrive on campus that this university is now yours and its future is in your hands, and that applies across the board: fundraising, the way we conduct ourselves on campus, if you want the way we claim the right to say what we want to say, which doesn’t mean whatever we want to say, that’s just absurd.
So, more than that, well what can a former president do? Accept invitations for parties where money will be raised for whatever good purpose. But accept invitations also where no money is being raised because the people giving the party don’t have the resources, but they count just a much. I always thought, “If somebody gives what she can, she’s indispensable to the campaign or the future.” She may be the teacher whose best student is Bill Clinton. He only applied to Georgetown, you know, and that terrifies her. What if her star student doesn’t get into college?
What do you think about the efforts of DeGioia and his staff on the capital campaigns recently?
I could devote a whole interview to telling you in various ways what admiration and confidence I have in Jack DeGioia. I also happen to know the chairman of the campaign — he, too, is an alum — and no one is more committed to the university then he is, and nobody is more committed to the importance of financial aid. I should probably pray more often for him and Jack.
