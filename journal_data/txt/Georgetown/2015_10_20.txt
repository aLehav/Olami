At least nine buildings on campus experienced power outages beginning at around 6:45 p.m. tonight due to an electrical transformer failure, according to a university-wide email from the Department of Emergency Management and Operational Continuity.
The affected buildings were Reiss Building, the Intercultural Center, Harbin Hall, Davis Performing Arts Center, Ryan and Mulledy Halls, Gervase Building, New North Building and Dahlgren Chapel.
“Due to an electrical transformer failure, it was necessary to shut down power to the … buildings while the university works to asses [sic] the issue,” the email read.
Power was restored to the buildings sequentially, beginning with the ICC at 8 p.m., Harbin at 8:20 p.m., the Former Jesuit Residence, New North and Dahlgren Chapel at 8:45 p.m and DPAC and Reiss before 9:30 p.m.
A university-wide email sent out by DEMOC at 10 p.m. said that all normal power has been restored in the buildings.
Vice President for Planning and  Facilities Management Robin Morey wrote in an email to The Hoya that several offices were involved in the recovery process. The Office of Planning and Facilities Management restored the power, DEMOC supported the recovery strategy and the Department of Safety and Environmental Management ensured laboratory safety in affected buildings.
Morey also said that electrical transformer failures are infrequent.
The fire alarm at O’Donovan Hall went off half an hour after the building experienced an outage for less than a minute. The cause of the alarm, which caused about 100 students to evacuate, has not been announced.
This post will be updated as more information becomes available.

When Georgetown University Student Association President Joe Luther (COL ’16) and Vice President Connor Rohan (COL ’16) launched their campaign in February, they only had two serious points — regarding sexual assault and mental health — on their otherwise satirical platform.
Luther and Rohan, who gave themselves a B-plus for their term, have negotiated with the administration on a range of issues, prioritizing sexual assault policy reform, disability access reform, master planning and mental health reform in their first seven months in office. In the future, the pair said they hope to delve deeper into these issues while reinvigorating the student engagement that helped them win the election in February.
Master Planning
Luther and Rohan estimate that they have spent half of their time in office on the issue of master planning. With deliberations concerning the 2018 Campus Plan under way, the duo meets frequently with administrators to discuss student concerns about housing policies and construction on campus.
“We’re continuing conversations about what’s a senior living in Georgetown look like, in terms of students maintaining the ability to live off campus,” Luther said.
In March, fresh off their campaign’s victory, Luther and Rohan and the GUSA Campus Plan Subcommittee launched “Let’s Not Get Screwed Again,” an online petition calling for the greater representation of student priorities in the master planning process.
The petition, which received 2,620 student signatures in two weeks, called on the university to not require more students to live on campus, prioritize the renovation of existing buildings over new construction projects and give students more representation in the negotiation process.
In July, Luther and Rohan achieved the third objective when the university appointed two more students — Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners Kendyl Clausen (SFS ’16) and Reed Howard (SFS ’17) — as representatives on the Georgetown Community Partnership Steering Committee. As GUSA president, Luther also holds a representative position on the committee.
Luther said he would like the university to prioritize students’ needs in drafting the campus plan.
“We don’t mind when the university is building new things, but it should be in response to real student demand,” Luther said.
According to Rohan, GUSA has also pressed the Planning and Facilities Management Department to address deferred maintenance issues. In late September, GUSA hosted a consortium with the university in which administrators and GUSA representatives responded to students’ concerns on construction.
Rohan said that these discussions with the administration have been constructive.
“I’m really encouraged with how the master planning conversations are going, because they’re frequent and they’re diverse,” Rohan said. “We’re finally coming to the point where the students and the administration agree on certain points.”
While the master planning process will continue into the next academic year, Rohan said that he is proud of the progress they have made thus far.
“We can’t build the campus plan in a year. We can’t build it in our term, but we can certainly lay the foundation and we’ve done a fantastic job of doing so,” Rohan said.
Sexual Assault Policy Reform
The pair has also made progress in negotiating sexual assault policy reform with the university.
In mid-September, GUSA reached a six-point memorandum of understanding with the administration on sexual assault policy reform, which Luther and Rohan called their proudest accomplishment.
Both GUSA and the university agreed to create a more survivor-centric campus by increasing bystander education programs, expanding marketing campaigns for survivor resources, collecting information about the university climate on sexual assault and expediting the hiring of a full-time Title IX coordinator.
In collaboration with student advocates, Luther and Rohan led negotiations with university administrators throughout the summer, when dialogue on sexual assault at Georgetown reignited after two survivors – Willa Murphy and Olivia Hinerfeld (SFS ’17) – wrote op-eds detailing their experiences which were published on thehoya.com.
Luther said that GUSA and student advocates need to work closely with the university in order to affect real change.
“GUSA is intrinsically an advocacy body, and in order to get anything done, the university has all the resources,” Luther said. “It’s on us to constantly be working with the university.”
Rohan said that they will continue to hold the university accountable to the agreements on the MOU.
“From now, we have to work with administrators and make it actually happen,” Rohan said.
Former GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said that the MOU was one of his successor’s most significant accomplishments.
“I think Joe and Connor have been doing a great job,” Tezel wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It’s been exciting to see them build off of the past work around sexual assault advocacy with the MOU with the university administration.”
Increasing Mental Health Dialogue
Luther and Rohan also identified improving mental health resources on campus as one of their core goals. The duo said they will spend the rest of their term conducting a comprehensive review of services provided by Counseling and Psychiatric Services and the state of mental health at Georgetown.
Earlier this month, GUSA hosted a panel discussion with students and administrators to address current policies and suggestions for reform.
According to Rohan, GUSA is also working on establishing a student-led counseling group independent from CAPS. The group will be based off of the student-run Empathy, Assistance and Referral Service group at Cornell University.
“If CAPS isn’t available or if CAPS is underwhelming, we want to provide that resource for students on campus,” Rohan said. “Hopefully within the next few months, we’ll have some very promising updates.”
Improving Disability Access
At the beginning of this academic year, GUSA worked together with the Office of Campus Activity Facilities and the Division of Student Affairs to hire Anisha Thadani as the university’s first access coordinator and events manager.
Luther said that the creation of the position marks an important step in improving campus accessibility to students with disabilities.
“Now [that] we have the position established, I think we have a good future in terms of events being accessible to all,” Luther said. “We’re on a … hill and we’re always under construction, so this is totally needed.”
Last year, Tezel and Jikaria worked with disability rights activist Lydia Brown (COL ’15) to advocate for the creation of a Disability Cultural Center. However, Rohan said that while he sees merit in establishing the center, he does not think it will be feasible in the near future.
“The space and the finance are the two biggest issues,” Rohan said. “I would love to see it happen. Whether I think it’s realistic, I don’t think it is right now. But I don’t think it is an impossibility for the future.”
Sustainability
GUSA organized a student-led visioning session in September to solicit the community’s input on university-wide sustainability goals. Luther and Rohan have also met with administrators to develop a proposal on sustainability. Rohan said that the negotiations are still ongoing.
“I think it’s a good start, but I do think it’s not concrete enough,” Rohan said. “A lot of what we’re doing now is working with that office to get concrete language, loftier goals, with the future of technology and the future of sustainability in mind.”
A Diverse GUSA, Campus
In addition to being the first successful satirical campaign in the history of GUSA, Luther and Rohan established the largest cabinet in history with 67 students.
Luther said that they consolidated student leaders from a diverse range of communities in order to create a more diverse GUSA.
“One of the first things Connor and I did after the election, for weeks, was we reached out to as many groups as we could, and a lot of those groups happened to be cultural groups,” Luther said. “In creating cabinet positions, we work to create positions that were focused on these issues.”
To promote diversity in the wider community, Luther and Rohan have also continued to support the GUSA Multicultural Council, which was established last year.
Engaging and Energizing
With seven months of experience under their belts, Luther and Rohan gave themselves an overall grade of B-plus, citing that they have yet to fulfill their original goal of energizing students about GUSA and important issues on campus.
“A lot of students don’t know what’s going on, and they think it’s outside of them,” Rohan said. “Sometimes it is, but if we were really men and women for others, we should think about these issues.”
Rohan said that they recently underwent a mid-term identity crisis, in which they realized that they had been following the footsteps of traditional GUSA executives.
“Because we were presented with all this information and we had to understand all of it, what eventually happened was that we fell into the trap of using that as the proper way to proceed,” Rohan said. “What it’s done is that it’s made us GUSA president and vice president.”
Luther attributed their inability to spark student interest to their own preoccupation with multiple projects.
“We need to delegate better. When something came up, Connor and I would just jump right into it,” Luther said. “Based on what we’re trying to do, which is energize GUSA, that can’t be the way to do this.”
Luther said that in the remaining months of their term, he and Rohan will make it their top priority to engage and energize students.
“Why we were elected was solely based on the fact that we were trying to transform GUSA and the image it communicates,” Luther said. “In terms of the next five, six months, we’re going to try and become more of our campaign selves, more back to our fun roots.”

Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a $47 million funding plan to aid city education, infrastructure, small businesses and parks across all eight wards of Washington, D.C., on Oct. 9.
The funding comes from the $25 million that the District gained in accepting a corporate sponsorship from the Potomac Electric Power Company for the development of the D.C. United Soccer Stadium, with the remainder sourced from city-wide underspending in the 2015 fiscal year.
The announcement on the mayor’s website highlighted the plan’s aim to enhance the city’s infrastructure, facilities and economy.
“Mayor Muriel Bowser is committed to investing in the priorities that are important to District residents,” the website reads. “These community improvements will boost the local economy and create pathways to the middle class.”
The Duke Ellington School of the Arts at 35th and R Street will receive a $9.8 million share of the funding to complete its $115 million renovation of its Georgetown campus. According to a Department of General Services report on the project, this renovation will low the school to accept an increase of students amounting to 10 percent of the current student population of 541. The remodeled version of the school is set to be approximately 258,072 square feet, almost 100,000 square feet larger than current facilities when it is completed in Fall 2016.
Until that time, displaced students will continue to be housed at the former Meyer Elementary and Garnett-Patterson Middle School in the U St/Columbia Heights neighborhood.
The largest allotment in the mayor’s plan, approximately $27 million, will go toward improving city infrastructure.
Among various other large-scale projects, this funding will allow for the creation of two new bridges — the Kenilworth Parkside Pedestrian Bridge and the H Street Bridge.
The Kenilworth Bridge is a part of a larger plan to connect Kenilworth with the greater D.C. area. Currently, Kenilworth lacks the proper infrastructure for pedestrians to safely enter and exit the area, leaving it isolated from the rest of the city.
Bowser’s Director of Communications Michael Czin said this bridge will address those concerns and make the area more accessible.
“The Kenilworth Pedestrian Bridge is really about helping strengthen the community,” Czin said. “It’s a challenge the way things are set up to get from Deanwood to the closer Metro, so this will help make the neighborhood a little bit safer for pedestrians.”
The H Street Bridge will cross First and Second Streets in Northeast Washington in an attempt to offer more transportation options to and from Union Station. The mayor’s plan cites this as a step in transforming Union Station into a greater transportation hub.
Beyond infrastructural projects, the funding will aid community development, with $4.5 million going to support for small businesses in the Cleveland Park, Anacostia, Marshall Heights and Kennedy Street areas. Another $500,000 will fund business incentives in the Dupont Circle, 14th Street, H Street and Shaw areas, such as the use of ecologically friendly trash compactors.
Czin said requests made by District residents catalyzed this decision.
“That will help out the Business Improvement Districts in those neighborhoods,” Czin said. “These are places where we heard that there is a need for increased support for small business and advocating for them out of those communities.”
The Office of Risk Management will also receive a $3 million allotment from the new funding plan, which will allow for the purchase of new technology. The aim is to increase the office’s efficiency for employees and for those who file claims through the office, which currently has no advanced system for claim management.
The office’s Risk Identification, Analysis and Control Division Manager Kim Nimmo spoke optimistically about this new technology.
“It helps us to run more efficiently because you are able to see all of the data in one place,” Nimmo said. “If you’re a District worker, you want things to be resolved quickly. Having a system in place gets that done much more effectively.”
Another component of the funding plan is the nearly $9 million that will go toward renovating city parks, including the park at Garrison Elementary School, the Lafayette Recreation Center and Ludlow Taylor Elementary playground.
Additionally, around $2 million is designated to the installation of a new media center in Benjamin Banneker High School and the improvement of pre-kindergarten classrooms at Maury Elementary School.
The remaining funds will go to the District’s Department of Oak Hill Youth Rehabilitation Services and the acquisition of blighted properties by the city for redevelopment.

The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences of the National Institutes of Health awarded The Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences $4.5 million to study environmental factors leading to breast cancer Oct. 8.
USU associate professor Celia Byrne and Lombardi professor Marybeth Martin will lead the study, a continuation of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences’ 2003 Breast Cancer and Environment Research Program that seeks to identify both the causes and potential cures of the disease.
Byrne explained that research into environmental factors affecting breast cancer could prove crucial to prevention efforts. In a press release, she noted that the issue is prevalent in Washington, D.C., as it has a high occurrence of breast cancer compared to the nation.
“Our study will work to address the reasons why Washington, D.C. has one of the highest rates of breast cancer incidence in the country,” Byrne said. “This type of research is important.”
According to a 2015 American Cancer Society study examining new breast cancer cases from 2007 to 2011, D.C. had a rate of 143 per 100,000 women, compared to the national average of 123 per 100,000 women.
The five-year study will focus on the effects of the hormone estradiol, which plays a crucial role in the development of breast cancer.
Martin said that the study will attempt to determine what, if any, environmental contaminants mimic estradiol’s effects on the body and how that is possible.
“Our laboratory showed that some metals mimic the effects of estradiol,” Martin wrote in an email to The Hoya. “[That] suggest[s] that environmental exposure to these metals may increase the risk of developing breast cancer.”
With that in mind, the study will involve members of the local community who have been exposed to these metals, as well as those who are currently receiving preventative treatment at the Lombardi Center. Martin explained that the study will be conducted with these local women in mind.
“Women who come to … Georgetown Lombardi’s Comprehensive Cancer Center’s Capital Breast Care Center for screening mammography will be invited to volunteer,” Martin wrote. “[We want community members] to participate in the study.”
Martin explained that the $4.5 million will be divided between two separate experiments, each helping to determine the general results of the study.
“One project is a basic science project that will determine the mechanism by which the metals mimic hormones,” Martin wrote. “The second project will ask whether breast density is associated with the amount of metals in the body as determined by measuring metals in a toenail sample.”
Martin stressed that this study is critical in preventing the spread and occurrence of breast cancer. She said that if the study is able to fulfill its goal in determining whether or not metals have an effect on the occurrence of breast cancer, the rate of the condition in Washington, D.C., could eventually decrease.
“Breast cancer is an epidemic yet the underlying causes of the disease are largely unknown,” Martin wrote. “If we find that environmental exposure to the metals is associated with mammographic breast density, a risk factor for the disease, minimizing exposure to these metals could have a significant effect on the incidence of breast cancer.”
Martin’s is the latest of several NIH grants that researchers with Lombardi’s Breast Cancer Program have received recently, including Hassad Bassem’s grant to demystify medical data and Suzanne O’Neill’s to analyze the role of breast density in risk counseling, respectively.
In a proclamation released Sept. 30 in advance of October’s Breast Cancer Awareness Month, President Barack Obama reaffirmed his administration’s commitment to researching the disease.
“My Administration is committed to advancing research to better prevent, diagnose and treat cancer in all its forms,” Obama wrote. “Together, we must ensure all people can enjoy the extraordinary gift that is a long, happy, and healthy life.”

TEDx Georgetown will return in its fifth iteration Saturday with 12 speeches centered on the theme of “Risk Takers,” featuring more interactive programming, a larger board and a new marketing campaign.
The speaker lineup includes students, alumni, faculty and public figures, including professional poker player Annie Duke and journalist and Georgetown University Law Center adjunct professor Colman McCarthy.
This year’s speeches will discuss the role of risk-taking in the speakers’ experiences of achievement, failure or inspiration. The event is divided into three separate subthemes: “Inspiring the Uninspired,” “Fail Forward” and “High-Risk, High-Reward.”
Caroline James (COL ’16), one of the student speakers, will share a story of her experiences of participating in civil disobedience, including her arrest at a protest. On campus, James serves as the Georgetown University Student Association secretary of sustainability and is a member of GU Fossil Free.
“If I can take the risk to get arrested, anyone can take the risk,” James said. “A lot of [my speech] is about the way that civil disobedience and aspects of this risk-taking are ways to participate in the democratic process. I want people to come away with the sense of what their various passions mean to them and really just how movements work.”
Darius Baxter (COL ’15), an alumnus speaker, will integrate his personal narrative into his talk.
“I plan to inspire the crowd by sharing little bits of my life story and weaving those stories together in order to hopefully bring people a little bit of happiness,” Baxter said.
Other speakers include McDonough School of Business Senior Associate Dean Norean Sharpe, graduate student Isvari Mohan (LAW ’17) and undergraduate student Scott Dennis (COL ’17).
This year’s event will also see increased dialogue between attendees and speakers with breakout sessions, replacing the question-and-answer format used in previous years.
According to TEDx Georgetown Co-Chair Mona Hussein (COL ’16), students will be able to reflect on the speeches more directly with the speakers during the breakout sessions.
“It was really a way for us to include people’s stories in a different kind of way and mend them into a story that people can take back home with them and think, ‘This is something that I will probably think about in the next few months’ or ‘This could be me,’” Hussein said.
The TEDx Georgetown board tripled in size to 18 members from six last year. According to Hussein, she and Co-Chair Kevin Carter (SFS ’16) wanted to consider a wider diversity of experiences by creating a larger board, which organizes all aspects of the event from logistics to selecting speakers.
“We not only focused on having a list of student speakers and outside speakers, but we also focused on the whole TEDx experience for the Georgetown community, for students, for faculty,” Hussein said.
Although the group began brainstorming for the event in April with the selection of the theme and board members, Carter said that the bulk of the preparation occurred at the beginning of the academic year.
“When everyone came back the first week of school, we really hit the ground running. We saw a lot of enthusiasm,” Carter said.
TEDx Georgetown Marketing Director Randy Puno (COL ’16) said that this year’s board focused on engaging and interacting with students.
Puno also cited this year’s marketing campaign, which was created by Director of Social Media Marketing David Kang (MSB ’18), as a new innovative way to engage the entire student body prior to the event.
The team placed stickers in the shape of an “X” across campus. Students who post a photo of a sticker on social media will receive VIP tickets and free TEDx apparel.
“It’s going to give people a chance to interact with the theme and become a part of the process,” Puno said. “It’s more than just a day conference with speakers, it’s more of a way for people to engage themselves.”
This year, the TEDx team also coordinated meetings between student speakers to go over their talks prior to the event. Speakers also met with assigned faculty to receive guidance.
“One of the most fun things has been that the different speakers are working on our speeches together, which I didn’t expect,” James said. “We’ve also been working with professors and the department of art and art history to work on presentation as well as the content of our speech.”
James praised the team’s help in providing training for speakers.
“In terms of the process from the speaker side, it’s been super well run. When I applied, I wasn’t thinking about the process, I was thinking about the speech. But the process has been just as fun,” James said.
Hussein said that the speeches will provide attendees with new perspectives on its speakers, particularly those from the Georgetown community.
“It’s a way for you to learn something new about your faculty or even outside speakers or even the speakers around you who you wouldn’t otherwise hear, whether in a classroom or something else,” Hussein said.
Puno also agreed that TEDx is a worthwhile experience for students, as it is representative of Georgetown’s academic spirit and Jesuit values.
“It’s such a uniquely Georgetown experience to be able to sit down and put all this cura personalis contemplation in action,” Puno said. “To be there for one day and absorb all these different stories and think about what they mean and then be inspired to do something about them, I think it speaks a lot to what we value as a school.”

“If I can take the risk to get arrested, anyone can take the risk.”
Frankly, I fail to see how a middle-class white girl asking to be arrested at a rally is a worthy example of risk taking. Especially when her parents are probably wealthy enough to afford whatever legal protection she most likely won’t need. 
It must be kind of insulting for black students who deal with the threat of arrest every day to listen to someone reduce a serious issue in their community to a tool of self-righteousness. 
Not everyone can afford to take that risk, Ms. James.

SFS 2016 says 
October 21, 2015 at 12:40 am
Seeing as Caroline went to the most expensive private school in Atlanta, she’s hardly middle class, but the point made is still accurate.

Caroline James says 
October 25, 2015 at 7:21 pm
Hi all, if you had actually come to the speech you would have heard the following:
1) a discussion of how the arrest was very much a privilege that we and I understand that we have and had, both from a financial perspective as well as a race perspective;
2) How I paid my bail (only $50) myself, from my own pocket, from work money I have made working part-time as a student to support paying my tuition, and since the topic had to do with civil disobedience as opposed to a larger charge, I did not need to go to court, etc. The charge was basically the same as a parking ticket.
I would also like to acknowledge that digging back to my high school is unnecessary, but even so, I earned merit scholarships in order to attend. 
Frankly, it shows an unwillingness on your part to better understand the actual purpose of civil disobedience if you think that we do not understand the difference between an arrest at a protest and the very real threats that people, especially people of color, face in our country.
If you would like to engage on this issue more, my email is [email protected]. I would encourage you to reach out, actually learn something, and await the posting of the speech on Facebook, which I think will clarify your obvious misconceptions.

More than 300 members of the Georgetown community participated in the second annual 5K Race Against Homelessness, a charity event hosted by the Georgetown Ministry Center and the Center for Social Justice, on Saturday.
Proceeds from the race go toward the GMC’s street outreach programs to combat chronic homelessness in Washington, D.C. According to the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, there were 12,000 homeless individuals in the District in 2014.
GMC could not provide the amount of donations raised at this year’s event. Last year’s race raised $12,000 for the GMC.
The race took place on the third annual Georgetown Community Day, a daylong celebration of the Georgetown neighborhood with live music, food and free giveaways organized by the university.
Multiple student groups and business were involved in sponsoring the event, including Students of Georgetown, Inc., Sigma Phi Epsilon, Kappa Kappa Gamma, the Georgetown Business Improvement District and Bank of Georgetown.
The event began with the 5-kilometer run and a 2-kilometer walk, followed by a post-race tailgate with food and music. Pre-registered runners and walkers received free merchandise to commemorate the race. Participants had the option of racing solo or creating a team of runners, walkers or a combination of the two.
5K Race Against Homelessness Marketing Director Nicole Du (COL ’16) said she was impressed with the day’s programming. Du publicized the event by creating a page on Facebook, encouraging students and members of the Georgetown community to register online in advance for a $5 reduction in price. Advanced registration cost $10 for participants under 22 and $20 for those over.
“The day was great,” Du said. “The weather was perfect, and afterwards there was a celebration with the whole Georgetown neighborhood.”
GMC Director of Leadership, Fundraising and Street Outreach Gunther Stern said that the event is still raising its profile at the university and is focused on increasing participation every year.
“This is a build year,” Stern said. “We’re hoping as the construction is done at Georgetown and we’re getting a little bit more experience, the course will be better and there will be a lot more people attracted to the race.”
While the mission of the event was to raise funds for the GMC to increase their community outreach, Stern said that it also sought to raise awareness of homelessness in the D.C. community.
According to Stern, the continuation of this event in its second year was largely dependent on funding from its sponsors. In addition to the student groups and Georgetown businesses, restaurants such as The Hamilton, Old Ebbitt Grill and Clyde’s of Georgetown contributed to the event.
Chris Regan (COL ’17), who served as Sigma Phi Epsilon’s liaison to the CSJ for the event, said that the race plays an important role in highlighting the issue of homelessness.
“I was amazed at the support [the event] earned from both the runners and the volunteers,” Regan said. “The issue of homelessness in Georgetown is usually overlooked because it’s such an affluent area, so I think the race’s greatest success is in its ability to bring attention to the problem and get the community thinking about it as a more prominent issue.”
Regan said he enjoyed his time at the race and hopes to have the opportunity to contribute to the event in the coming years.
“I was very happy to be involved in the race this year,” Regan said. “It is something that I certainly hope to continue being a part of it in the future.”
Stern said that although this is only the second year that the race has been held, he has high hopes for future iterations of the event.
“We’re hoping this is something that we’ll continue to do for a while,” Stern said.

Beset by ongoing legal challenges from the D.C. Chamber of Commerce, grassroots efforts to increase Washington, D.C.’s minimum wage to $15 by 2020 have stalled for the foreseeable future.
Launched by a coalition of both local and national labor and social justice oriented advocacy groups this past April, including Restaurant Opportunities Centers United and Working Families Organization, the campaign seeks to eliminate the current subminimum wage paid to tipped employees by establishing a ballot measure for the 2016 election. The measure aims to create a $15-per-hour wage floor by 2020 and ensure tipped restaurant workers the same $15 wage floor by 2025.
At present, the minimum hourly wage in the District, currently set at $10.50, will reach $11.50 by July 2016, per the Minimum Wage Amendment Act of 2013 that raised the rate from $8.25 per hour in annual increments.
The coalition’s efforts for
a $15 wage floor, more than double the federal minimum wage of $7.25, are not without precedent. Several West Coast cities, led by Seattle and San Francisco, have pledged to transition to $15 minimums by 2020, the latter of whom included a clause in its proposal to raise the minimum wage of tipped restaurant workers as well. However, Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Harry Wingo filed a civil suit against the D.C. Board of Elections and Ethics in August citing language within the measure that may imply, incorrectly, that the increase would apply to nonservice workers. In addition to the measure’s wording, Wingo takes issue with possible job losses as a result of the raised wage, particularly for government workers and contractors who would not benefit from the raise, suggesting that the ballot measure may violate D.C.’s longstanding Home Rule Act, which carries provisions for District spending on services. The Board of Elections and Ethics approved the measure’s language in July, but Wingo’s lawsuit aims to stop it from making its way to the November 2016 ballot.
Wingo said private-sector job growth could be impaired as a result of raised wages.
“Increasing the cost of doing business in the District is the biggest threat to local companies,” Wingo said in a statement on the Chamber of Commerce’s website. “It’s important to future job growth and our economic vitality not to adversely impact these establishments.”
A 2015 survey of District employers published by the Chamber of Commerce indicated that a majority of local business owners would not hire more employees should the minimum wage rise to $15, a potential detriment to local business.
Nevertheless, Director of Restaurant Opportunities Center D.C. Gaby Madriz explained that the group hopes to move forward with the November 2016 ballot measure as soon as the suit’s conclusion will allow.
“Right now we’re in a period [where] we’ve filed our initial motion and we basically just have to go back and forth,” Madriz said. “We’re hoping to have a final hearing in mid-November.”
Madriz said that despite the difficult legal battle, she believes the payoffs of an increased minimum wage will be worth it for many low-income workers and businesses.
“I think [a minimum wage increase] would really help go a long way for folks not to have to be constantly struggling with the rising prices in D.C.,” Madriz said. “In the long run we do believe that the trend that we’ve seen in other places of the local economy growing [would continue].”
Should Wingo lose the lawsuit, the coalition will begin a new campaign in January to obtain 24,000 signatures of D.C.-registered voters to place the measure on the ballot. Seventy percent of registered voters said they supported the measure, according to The Washington Post.
An increase in the minimum wage would also raise prices for products sold by companies and groups on campus. In the past, Students of Georgetown, Inc. typically increases its prices by 5 cents following increases in the minimum wage, according to Corp CEO Marnie Wallach (NHS ’16).
“Over the last two years, and continuing as the minimum wage continues to increase, we’ve had to work to adjust prices,” Wallach said. “[This is] in order to account for the increase in wage expenses.”
However, Wallach said that she would expect a greater price increase if the minimum wage were to rise to $15 per hour.
She added that price increases are driven not only by salary increases for Corp employees, but also by vendors’ increasing costs. As vendors pay workers more, costs increase to maintain profit levels, which trickles down to Corp prices.
“A D.C.-wide increase [on] wages not only affects our company, but also most of our vendors,” Wallach said. “As they raise prices to account for their own increased wages, we’ve had to monitor that and do the same.”
Following previous wage hikes in the District, including, most recently, a July 2014 graduated wage hike from $8.25 to $9.50, University departments had incorporated the anticipated hike and its effects on student employees into departmental budgets, with some departments raising the idea of increasing the number of student employees hired on federal work-study, to account for the change.

The Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security hosted a panel discussion on the lack of female involvement in climate change mitigation and the effect climate change has on women in the Intercultural Center Auditorium on Friday.
The event, titled “Women and Climate Change: Impact and Agency in Human Rights, Security and Economic Development,” featured speakers including former President of Ireland Mary Robinson, former President of Finland Tarja Halonen, GIWPS Director Melanne Verveer, Care USA Vice President Radha Muthiah, and Vice President of the World Bank and Special Envoy for Climate Change Rachel Kyte.
GIWPS hosted the event to mark the release of its new report, which highlights the disproportionate vulnerability of women to impacts of climate change compared to men, as well as the benefits of involving women in climate change negotiations.
After a brief introduction by School of Foreign Service Dean Joel Hellman, Robinson provided a brief history of women’s involvement in climate change mitigation policy, recalling the role of women in recent climate change victories such as the 2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Doha, Qatar.
Muthiah emphasized how women in poverty see the worst impacts of climate change in their daily lives. According to Muthiah, women in poverty must walk long distances for cooking fuel because of deforestation. Additionally, once they obtain the cooking fuel, toxic fumes slowly degrade their health and overall well-being.
“Four million deaths per year … can be attributed to the inefficient cook stoves and fuel, where women are really at the forefront of both the design, manufacture, distribution and creation of awareness among other women about these alternative and better ways of cooking,” Muthiah said.
However, Muthiah said that women have been active in sustainability initiatives in their communities.
“What we’re seeing as a result of this is that women have more time, they come up with … environmentally sustainable practices, and they are taking more leadership roles within their communities,” Muthiah said.
The panelists also discussed the U.N.’s recent adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals. Goals 5 and 13b specifically recognize the role of women in climate change action. All the speakers agreed that policy negotiators must do more to ensure that women stay involved in the planning and management of climate change mitigation.
Halonen spoke on the Sustainable Development Goals and the lessons that the U.N. learned from the Millennium Development Goals, which addressed extreme poverty and environmental sustainability.
“You have to make them more transparent– the whole system. That’s why it’s very important that we have good indicators. We also have to be flexible to see whether or not we have found the correct index system so we can adjust and correct it,” Halonen said. “International financial institutions, like the World Bank or the [International Monetary Fund], are also people we have to work with to establish good climate and business budgets.”
In his concluding remarks, Kyte emphasized the need for future climate change policies to focus on resilience, especially in anticipation of climate change disasters, and to be representative of both men and women. In addition, she stressed the need to put a price on carbon.
“These decisions won’t get made unless [women] are in the room,” Kyte said. “The price of action is so much higher than the price of inaction. However difficult it is to pass legislation, it is nowhere near as difficult as having to completely rebuild.”
Jessica Hickle (SFS ’18) attended the event in part due to her interest in women’s issues, and also to expand her knowledge on the issue of climate change.
“I wanted to be able to hear from experts about it. I thought it was really eye-opening,” Hickle said. “Every time I’ve heard about climate change, it’s never been in the context that it was today, with the importance of women in the issue. I am so shocked that more people don’t talk about this side of it.”

When young children visit the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum and have questions — whether it’s about a planet, an exhibition, or a spaceship — they can ask the “Explainers,” groups of hired high school and college students trained in all things space.
Gilda Gallardo (COL ’17) who works at the National Air and Space Museum as an “Explainer,” and said she enjoys boiling down complicated topics like orbits and gravity with visual presentations.
“Something like pocket science, for example, like I’ll have a game with cards where you order the celestial bodies based on distance from the sun,” Gallardo said. “Then there’s the 30-minute interactions when I’m on a stage and I have a microphone and speak to various people who are coming and going about anything from the physics of flight [to] leading a paper airplane contest.”
In an effort to expand the National Air and Space Museum’s education curriculum and “Explainer” program, General Electric Aviation announced a $5 million sponsorship with the museum last month.
“I know what it meant for me, as a young student, to visit the National Air and Space Museum,” GE Aviation President and CEO David Joyce said at a press event in late September. “It opened my mind to opportunities that I hadn’t imagined before, and taught me that every day people can make incredible contributions. That inspired me for a long time.”
The partnership will allow the museum to hire more “Explainers” and to develop an electronic version of the program for students who cannot physically visit the museum. The initiative, “Electronic Outreach Explainers,” will use online video conferencing to connect 5th and 6th grade students in Cincinnati Public Schools with “Explainers,” who will teach them lessons about space and allow them to ask questions.
Gallardo said the idea is to take the content provided by the museum and use it to supplement the work being done in the classroom. They will work with Cincinnati students as GE Aviation is based in the city. In addition to the $5 million given to the museum, GE will sponsor Cincinnati Public Schools with $1 million over the next year to help them develop content and cover the cost of the technology students need to participate in the program.
“We model our lessons after the standards in the state, and we try to make it as interactive as we can even though we’re not there in person,” Gallardo said. “We’re also able to cut the show and have an expert talk to us or relate what they’re doing to the concepts we’re explaining.”
Maureen Kerr, chair of the museum’s Education Division, said that if the program works, she hopes to expand the videoconferencing program to other schools and cities. Kerr said the “Explainers” work especially well with younger visitors including elementary and middle school tour groups.
“The goal there is to get the kids excited about [science, technology, engineering, and math education], give them role models of kids [the “Explainers”] who are excited and very knowledgeable about the STEM subject and sharing the resources of the Smithsonian,” Kerr said. “We’re trying to make a close connection between what the students are studying in the classroom and what work the scientists and experts do at the Smithsonian.”
GE Aviation Education Programs Manager Amy Englert said she hopes the program will not only provide real world experience within various scientific fields, but also entice more students to study and pursue careers in science.
“The idea is to bring curriculum-aligned science content to students who aren’t maybe able to travel to the museum in person,” Englert wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It exposes them to a: real-world connections to what they’re learning in the classroom, and b: career opportunities within STEM fields. Ideally we want to see this grow to be a pilot of a national model.”

Georgetown celebrated the quincentenary of St. Teresa of Avila, a prominent historic figure in the Catholic Church, with an all-day series of panel discussions and performances exploring the modern implications of her legacy in Lohrfink Auditorium on Friday.
The free anniversary celebration, which took place the day after the saint’s feast day, included a symposium of renowned Teresian scholars, a Spanish music performance by the Georgetown University Orchestra and scenes from a play, “God’s Gypsy,” based on the life of Mother Teresa by students in the department of performing arts.
St. Teresa, who was born in 1515 in Gotarrendura, Spain, is renowned for co-founding the Discalced Carmelites, a mendicant order in the Catholic Church, with St. John of the Cross. She is also noted for her work as a theologian, author and reformer of the church.
The commemoration was organized by faculty in the department of Spanish and Portuguese and the department of performing arts. The Embassy of Spain, the Casey-McIlvane Memorial Lecture Fund and the Carmelitana Collection also sponsored the event.
On Thursday, Spanish professor Barbara Mujica, who is a Teresian scholar, hosted a lecture to address the topic of whether or not St. Teresa was a feminist.
The symposium featured five scholars from around the United States, including adjunct Georgetown professor Fr. Brian O. McDermott, S.J., Carmelite nun Constance FitzGerald, theology professor at Xavier University Gillian Ahlgren, Spanish professor at the University of Virginia Alison P. Weber and history teacher at Holton Arms School Christopher Wilson.
Each scholar spoke about different aspects of St. Teresa’s spirituality, ranging from the influence and support she received from Jesuits to her writings on love and friendship.
Ahlgren said that Teresa sought to explain the relationship between God and man.
“St. Teresa showed us … that with God, we become part of the work of revealing the world,” Ahlgren said. “Working for dignity, renouncing and denouncing sin and injustice, growing in truth and love and drawing others into this life-giving creative activity.”
The day’s festivities ended with artistic performances. Georgetown University Orchestra Music Director Angel Gil-Ordóñez said the pieces chosen for the performance were influenced by the time period of St. Teresa.
“We found music that was inspired by the poetry and the popular songs of the time. These songs were sung there at the time,” Gil-Ordóñez said. “We found two Spanish composers of the 20th century, and it makes total sense because the sounds and the Renaissance flavor make a beautiful combination.”
Gil-Ordóñez said it is valuable to combine art with academia.
“Music plays an extraordinary role in the contextualization of any other intellectual activity,” Gil-Ordóñez said. “There is no better place than within the university to explore these fascinating interactions between history, culture and the rest of the arts.”
Georgetown University Orchestra percussionist Kyle Rinaudo (SFS ’18), who performed at the concert, said that this performance was different from anything the orchestra has done in the past.
“Usually our performances are big classical works. We do a lot of these big, grand pieces,” Rinaudo said. “This concert is a lot of smaller pieces, less well known and a lot smaller orchestration.”
In addition to the programming, the Booth Family Center for Special Collections displayed 69 documents and objects related to St. Teresa in an exhibition running from Aug. 31 to Dec. 18. The collection includes early Discalced Carmelite documents, such as a first edition of Teresa’s works.
Director of the Booth Family Center for Special Collections John Buchtel, who oversees the library’s archives and collections, said that the collection consists of both old and new items on display.
“Some of the works on display are drawn from collections that have been here for more than 100 years,” Buchtel said. “We have been adding to the collection recently using our acquisition funds to find rare, relevant materials about St. Teresa.”
Georgetown owns one of St. Teresa’s rarest publications, “Los libros de la madre Teresa de Iesus,” published in 1588. It is unclear as to when the publication first arrived at Georgetown.
Buchtel said that the collection contains many other works that have been influenced by St. Teresa.
“One of the things the exhibition shows is just how significant an impact St. Teresa has had on the history of spirituality and on women’s history,” Buchtel said.
