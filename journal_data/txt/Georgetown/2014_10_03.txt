Around 200 protesters, including several Georgetown students, gathered at the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office and marched to the White House on Wednesday night to demonstrate support for the Occupy Central protest currently occurring in Hong Kong, where 14 Georgetown students are currently studying abroad.
The rally was organized by Global Solidarity with Hong Kong, a political awareness group advocating for universal suffrage in Hong Kong. On Wednesday, Oct. 1, the National Day of China, the group held similar events supporting pro-democracy protests in 64 cities worldwide.
In Hong Kong, an estimated 150,000 protestors, including university students, have participated in sit-ins across the city’s main districts since Sunday, calling for the Chief Executive C.Y. Leung’s resignation and for democratic electoral reform. The protesters blame Leung, who was appointed to his position two years ago, for the current political stalemate, but Leung has refused to step down. The movement gained international media attention when riot police used tear gas and pepper spray to subdue the nonviolent protesters.
“Right now, the current situation [in Hong Kong] can be described as a war of attrition. It is a battle for the hearts and minds of the people in Hong Kong,” said Roger Li (SFS ’15), a Hong Kong native who participated in the D.C. rally. “I wanted to do as much as I could to show the world how polite and peaceful the protesters are in Hong Kong.”
Fourteen students in the Hong Kong Special Administration Region are studying with programs through the Office of Global Education, according to the office’s director, Craig Rinker.
According to Katy Berk (COL ’16), a former opinion editor for The Hoya currently studying abroad in Hong Kong, study-abroad advisers have advised Georgetown students not to participate in the protests and that it would be a violation of rules and could result in a loss of credits.
“Between that rule and the potential for violence, I’ve chosen not to attend the protests, though they’ve been quite peaceful and orderly since Sunday evening,” she wrote in an email. “The entire highway is flooded with people, the protesters are remarkably polite — serving each other free water, crackers, cool towels, hand sanitizers, even trays of McDonald’s — and there is a lively upbeat atmosphere.”
Michael Woo Cho (MSB ’16), another student studying abroad, said the protest he attended on Sept. 28 was the most violent.
“Tear gas came from everywhere and rubber bullets on the day after the protest, apparently. But people were helping each other out. Students, foreign and domestic, helped the wounded to the back and carried water, food, and medical [supplies] (masks, goggles and vinyl wraps) to the front lines and a lot of adults and old citizens were helping out, too. All for their democracy. An eye watering scene,” Cho wrote in an email.
In solidarity, the Washington marchers donned black apparel and yellow ribbons as they raised open umbrellas, which came to symbolize the movement in China after protestors warded off tear gas from riot police with umbrellas.
The D.C. event began at the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, where organizers distributed ribbons and flyers. Although ribbons were tied to railings outside the office, they were removed by the request of local police.
Around 7 p.m. Wednesday, the participants marched from the Trade Office to the front of the White House, raising signs and chanting along the way in both Cantonese and English. The chants mirrored those in Hong Kong, including “Democracy, Hong Kong” and “689 Resign.” In Hong Kong, “689” is a widely used nickname for the unpopular  Leung, who was elected from 689 votes in the electoral college of 1200 members. Those opposed to Leung claim that he has political leanings toward China’s mainland leadership. Just after his election in 2012, the People’s Daily, the Chinese newspaper, called Leung “comrade,” and later that year, Leung decided to require pro-China patriotic teaching in school, a decision that was eventually vetoed.
At the White House, participants sang protest anthems in Cantonese, including “Under a Vast Sky” and “Do You Hear the People Sing?” from the musical “Les Miserables.” Jeffrey Ngo, one of the rally’s main organizers, pointed to the gathering outside of the White House as a highlight of the event.
“We applied last minute for the permit to gather right outside of the White House, and it was approved. I don’t know if Obama was at home, but if so, I’m sure he heard us,” Ngo said. “I think being able to sing such an important song as a group at that location, legally, is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.”
Ngo hoped that the rally would bring increased attention and a response from the White House to the Hong Kong protests.
“We have gathered over 100,000 signatures to support the petition asking for the White House to respond to the situation in Hong Kong. No other place is more symbolic than outside the White House to sing our song to support democracy in our hometown,” Ngo said.
A sophomore in the MSB*, a protest participant born and raised in Hong Kong, agreed. He said that he hoped the rally would place increased pressure on China from the United States, particularly on Clement Leung, Hong Kong commissioner for economic and trade affairs and the most senior representative from the region to the United States.
“The U.S. really is one of Hong Kong’s largest trading partners and we hold more sway than I think we realize. It is important to get Clement Leung’s attention,” he said.
Earlier on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Secretary of State John Kerry at the State Department to discuss the current situation in Hong Kong, stressing China’s sovereignty over Hong Kong, and warning the United States not to interfere in internal affairs.
“Hong Kong’s affairs are China’s affairs. All countries should respect China’s sovereignty,” Wang told multiple news outlets.
Ngo criticized Wang’s declaration.
“China obviously wants to keep foreign countries out of the situation, so that it can continue to exploit Hong Kongers’ rights,” Ngo said. “But I believe the international community, especially the U.K., has the responsibility to ensure that the terms of the Joint Declaration are respected.”
The People’s Republic of China government re-obtained sovereignty over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997. The Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong guaranteed the territory rights and freedoms, including freedom of the press, of speech, of assembly, of religious belief and of demonstration.
Many of the students leading Hong Kong’s protests are the first generation to grow up with memories of only Chinese rule.
Like Li, many participants at the D.C. event are Hong Kong expatriates. Marco Lam (MSB ’18) attended the rally as an observer concerned for his home in Hong Kong.
“Many friends I know back home are divided over their political affiliations. Some are protesting, others are anti-protest. I came here today to witness the global support for Hong Kong. Above all, I am impressed to see people halfway across the world engaged in this political discourse about Hong Kong,” Lam said.
However, not all the students who participated were from the semi-autonomous region. Lixun Chen (SFS ’16), originally from mainland China, expressed his belief for the necessity of freedom and democracy in Hong Kong.
“As a frequent visitor to Hong Kong, I have always regarded it as a hub of information where I could freely gather information that was censored in China. This preservation of freedom resonates with me on a personal level,” Chen said.
Chen called for increased awareness at the university about the issue.
“I would encourage the Georgetown community to seize the initiative and learn about the history of the Hong Kong people,” he said. “To support the cause, we simply need to make it known to others.”

A student protest in Healy Circle went uninterrupted by the Georgetown University Police Department on Thursday morning, although H*yas for Choice was not allowed to table in the same spot last year.
The protest targeted the university’s invitation to Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, to speak in Gaston Hall on Thursday. Protesters played a live-action game dubbed “International Monopoly Fund,” satirizing the IMF’s approach to working with developing nations and the global economy.
According GUPD Chief Jay Gruber, the difference between GUPD’s reaction to the two groups is that yesterday’s protest did not involve setting up a table.
“The whole campus is considered a free speech zone so as long as students aren’t tabling, they can protest anywhere on campus as long as they meet the parameters of the Speech and Expression Policy,” Gruber said. “Students can pretty much stand wherever they want as long as they’re not in violation of the Speech and Expression Policy and under university policies.”
The university’s Speech and Expression Policy states that certain “public squares” are open for student tabling, such as Red Square, Regents Lawn and the lobby of the Leavey Center, known as free speech zones. The policy also specifies that protests are not subject to the same limitations as tabling activities.
According to Gruber, H*yas for Choice was removed from Healy Circle in January because they set up a table. The group was also mistakenly forced to stop tabling on the sidewalk outside the front gates in protest of a ceremony granting an honorary degree to Donald Cardinal Wuerl, archbishop of Washington — a decision in violation of the Speech and Expression Policy, for which GUPD has since apologized.
“Having the students table there, that’s really a mean difference. Anyone can set up and stand somewhere, they can hold a banner, they can hold a sign, they can voice their opinion anywhere on campus,” Gruber said. “If you read the Speech and Expression Policy, it specifically mentions that tabling has to take place in certain places on campus. It may seem kind of trivial, but there is a fine difference.”
According to protester Suzy Jivotovski (COL ’15), GUPD officers were present near the group’s monopoly performances in Healy Circle and Red Square, but did not approach the students.
“GUPD was present in the area and had their eye on us, but never came over to say anything,” Jivotovski said.
Jivotovski said the group made sure that they were fully versed in the Speech and Expression Policy to avoid altercations with university officers.
“Especially in light of what happened with H*yas for Choice last week, we made sure that everyone who was participating knew where the free speech zones were and we had a response plan in case GUPD did approach us about the free speech zones,” Jivotovski said.
Chandini Jha (COL ’16), one of three student members of the Speech and Expression Committee, said that tables are currently considered “permanent installations” under the current policy.
“We are still having discussions as a free speech and expression committee about what to classify as permanent installations,” Jha said. “Basically, the situation is that we are still in the process of discussing if tables are installations that people can put down.”
Jha said that she hopes to work with the committee to secure more rights for tabling students.
“As a student representative on the group, I want to advocate for students. Tabling is so instrumental at Georgetown,” Jha said. “It’s the way that student groups really get their message out there, but also have a visual point of contact for the organization by having students sit and stand behind the table. It’s something that’s a continued topic of discussion.”

International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde’s lecture in Gaston Hall on Thursday morning prompted a student protest of her invitation to campus and of the IMF.
In her lecture, Lagarde evaluated the future of the global economy and discussed ideas for resolving international economic problems.
About 10 students, unaffiliated with any student group, used props to play a game of “International Monopoly Fund” to show their opposition to the IMF as the lecture started at 11 a.m.
Students at Smith College protested Lagarde’s invitation to their campus in May, prompting her to drop out as the college’s commencement speaker.
Critics of the IMF charge that the organization has supported oppressive governments in providing aid to developing nations while imposing conditions that favor Western businesses and countries.
“That’s about the wealthy, Western countries that in the case of the IMF, have created really harmful and exploitative situations in other countries around the world that are poorer,” said Suzy Jivotovski (COL ’15), who participated in the protest.
The monopoly game, which protesters performed three times split between Healy Circle and Red Square, positioned protesters as “big business” and pawns as the IMF.
“It was kind of a total satire on the IMF’s lack of transparency, on their very interventionist, loan-shark mentality toward the global economy, toward exports,” Jivotovski said.
In her speech, Lagarde discussed the role of developing countries in the global economy.
“The developing countries have been doing all the heavy lifting in the past five years, contributing to roughly 80 percent of global growth,” Lagarde said. “Led by Asia primarily, particularly China, they will continue to contribute, but at a slightly slower pace because we are all interconnected. If some of the players are injured, the others will be affected too.”
Although these countries are in a period of growth, Lagarde said that the global economy is struggling to come back from financial turmoil.
“The bottom line is that six years after the financial crisis, we continue to see weakness in the global economy,” Lagarde said. “We are still dealing with the legacies of the crisis — much higher debt levels and unemployment are still major difficulties.”
In proposing macroeconomic solutions to these issues, Lagarde pointed to fiscal policy, labor market reform and infrastructural reform.
“Have you heard about growth-friendly, job-friendly, and environmentally friendly fiscal policy? Because so much has already been done in terms of fiscal consolidation, countries have to do so at the right pace — not too fast, not too brutally, and they have to adjust to circumstances,” Lagarde said.
Lagarde also encouraged efficient public spending, reduction of taxes on labor costs and methods to battle tax evasion and said that tackling unemployment is a priority. She criticized current energy subsidies for fossil fuels, which cost $2 trillion in the past year, mostly to the benefit of developed countries.
However, she suggested that there is no definite method to implement labor market reform.
“There is no magic recipe because it has to be country-specific. It has to deal with the particularities of the skillset, the educational system and the kind of growth,” Lagarde said.
Lagarde pushed for policies allowing more women to enter the workforce worldwide, to maximize potential output. Lastly, she advocated for more spending on infrastructure, from providing more Massive Open Online Courses to increase workers’ skillsets to the repair of poorly constructed roads.
Anthony Albanese (COL ’16) found many of Lagarde’s comments to be relatable to domestic issues.
“The idea that increasing women’s participation in the labor force and environmental policies do not significantly decrease growth is a contentious issue domestically,” Albanese said. “That wasn’t something I expected her to say. Especially as a lot of times when speakers talk to students, you hear a lot of vague comments, so it was cool to hear her speak to something so specific.”
Muriel Van de Bilt (SFS ’17) not only appreciated Lagarde’s emphasis on gender inequality in the labor market, but also praised her as a role model.
“Seeing a woman in such a high leadership position in a field that is usually male-dominated makes me realize that she is an example for future generations of female economists,” Van de Bilt said.
The protesters outside Healy Hall said they opposed Lagarde’s lecture because it represented the university’s propensity to present students with a singular perspective.
“The people who put on the action are just a concerned group of students that wanted to create a counterpoint to Christine Lagarde of the IMF speaking at Gaston Hall this morning to represent that we don’t like how the president’s office and administration time and time again invites speakers who talk to students about things that really only have a singular viewpoint,” Jivotovski said.

The Corcoran Gallery of Art officially closed for renovations Sept. 28 after changing ownership to the National Gallery of Art and George Washington University.
The National Gallery of Art will take ownership of all artwork in the museum, which is located on 500 17th St NW; the museum, which will house contemporary and modern art, will be renamed the Corcoran Contemporary, National Gallery of Art.
George Washington University will operate the Corcoran College of Art and Design, though it remains undecided how exactly it will be integrated into the university and what tuition former Corcoran students will pay. The classes at the Corcoran will continue to take place in the Corcoran building, and the tuition will stay the same at least for this school year.
About 50 board members, staff members, former students, artists and other supporters gathered Sept. 27 for a “funeral” for the formerly privately owned gallery, complete with speeches, tours of the gallery and the ceremonial laying of a wreath on the Corcoran family mausoleum.
“We are left with a gorgeous building, but it is no longer the Corcoran, but a cenotaph, a memorial to something that is not there, an empty tomb,” former director Michael Botwinick said in a statement read at the funeral by former public relations chief Carolyn Campbell.
The D.C. Superior Court approved the takeover of both the gallery and the college by the National Gallery and GWU last month, after months of deliberation and delay since the announcement of the takeover in February. Curators from both the National Gallery and the original Corcoran staff will review the pieces from the Corcoran collection to determine which will be kept within the National Gallery and which will be offered to other museums.
Founded in 1869, the Corcoran Gallery, known for its broad collection of exhibitions with an emphasis on American art and strong support of local artists, was one of D.C.’s longest standing privately supported institutions.
“It is a genuine loss for local artists, and for the many people in the D.C. area, from preschoolers to post-grad, who were able to receive an excellent art education here,” said Lisa Strong, director of Georgetown’s Art and Museum Studies M.A. Program. Strong worked as a curator at the Curatorial Department of the Corcoran from July 2010 to June 2014.
According to John Morrell, Associate professor of painting and drawing at Georgetown, the future of the Corcoran depends on the dedication of the National Galley and GWU, and remains uncertain.
“It was a very integral part of the art community for over a century here in Washington, and people feel very strongly one way or another about its future,” Morrell said. “It’s sad to think that the Corcoran legacy will be seen mostly on labels from here on out, but only time will tell. It’s an unknown future that will be determined by the players involved.”
Strong agreed that the D.C. community would feel the loss of the gallery.
“It presented an independent and unique perspective on contemporary art. Its small size and close relationship with the local art community meant that it could mount shows that the big, federally funded institutions could not. That point of view is lost forever,” she said.
The Corcoran Gallery struggled financially in the years preceding the D.C. Superior Court decision, finishing its 2012 fiscal year with a deficit $9.2 million and its 2013 fiscal year with a deficit of $5.5 million. Strong said that the increasing budget cuts made the operation of the museum difficult as it neared its end.
“I watched as the staff fought to hold the standards of the profession in the face of dramatic budget cuts and cancelled exhibitions. It was very difficult to see the staff contend with the shrinking resources of the museum,” she said.
The Corcoran is projected to re-open as part of the National Gallery of Art in 2015. Fifteen Corcoran staff members and curators, together with multiple members of the National Gallery, are working to smooth the transition.
“The National Gallery of Art will present important works from the Corcoran collection, as well as vibrant and exciting special exhibitions of modern and contemporary art, so we anticipate that the Corcoran will continue to be an important focal point for the community interested in both American and modern art,” Deborah Ziska, National Gallery chief of press and public information, wrote in an email to The Hoya.
GWU is assuming ownership of Corcoran College and the building itself, reserving the front galleries for contemporary exhibits from the National Gallery.
“The school is still operating and classes are continuing as normal,” Kurtis Hiatt, GWU associate director of media relations, said of Corcoran College. “Like the National Gallery of Art, the Corcoran, when it reopens after the renovation in late 2015, will be open free of charge.”

Cuban journalist Yoani Sanchez is one of the foremost online advocates for free speech worldwide. Her personal blog, Generación Y, is translated into two dozen languages and receives over 14 million hits per month, and she started Cuba’s first daily online newspaper, 14ymedio. Sanchez brings her knowledge of communication in closed societies to Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service as the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy’s new Yahoo Fellow in International Values, Communications, Technology and the Global Internet. Sanchez will be on campus for the 2014-2015 school year, and she will teach a series of short workshops and seminars for the MSFS this spring on how to best use social media in closed societies. This interview has been translated from Spanish and edited for clarity.
How did your blog [Generación Y] start and how has it grown to what it is now?
My blog started over seven years ago in 2007. It came to be because I felt in my life very asphyxiated. I had certain elements of my life where I couldn’t really express myself, and I found the blog to be a tool in which I can go ahead and liberate myself from that asphyxiation.
I think the blog has been successful and has gained interest among readers because of many reasons. One is definitely because it is written from a country where censorship is part of everyday life and that is an element that people are very curious about. It also started shortly after Raul Castro was transferred power as president of Cuba, and so a lot of people wanted to know what was going on in the country, what was happening, and in the blog they found answers to that question.
Another element was the fact that it was written by a person born in the revolution, and who was a child of the revolution, someone that was putting out there very critical texts and was criticizing the government, and was doing it with a lot of dissolution from the island. This was a different voice from the official voice of Cuba, which is always the ones who are in power.
I also think the fact that the Generación Y blog was written by a woman, especially in a society where most of the political discourse is handled by men, was something that was very attractive.
Did you ever feel, working in Cuba on freedom of expression, that you were in danger, as power was shifting?
Yes. A few days before I was going to write my first post and after I had made the decision to write this blog, I had butterflies in my stomach. I was very nervous because I knew I was able to cross a very particular line and I was not sure what was going to happen on the other side or what was going to be on the other side. But I also understood that the more that I wrote in my blog, the more that I was increasing the danger, but I was also increasing the protection — the protection that my readers gave me.
How did you get other people involved, knowing this would be a dangerous situation? Or did the hope of protection influence other people to want to join?
Having a blog is like having a virus. It’s very contagious. As other people started to catch on to this, they realized that by doing their own blog, they were opening a space that they didn’t have before. I feel very lucky and very proud to have been a pioneer, to be one of the first independent bloggers in Cuba.
Speaking of growth, how have working on the blog and the newspaper helped you to grow individually?
I have to be much more responsible about how to speak and how to use words carefully because I’ve realized that words can have a wonderful impact or they can also bring the demons out in people, because I’m dealing with a very controversial topic, a topic that generates a lot of passion in people, which is the topic of Cuba. And I’ve also learned how to understand and get to know my country much better. Before 2007, I knew that repression existed; I knew that we lived in a dictatorship. But after seven years of living it myself in flesh and blood, I have lifted off the mask of that dictatorship and now see it eye to eye.
How do you see online mediums helping diplomacy and journalism to coincide to better the world and society?
A big goal of mine is, through my journalism and through our journalism as a medium, that we start breaking down the stereotypes that Cuba is just an island where we drink on the beach and play maracas. We’re also not an island full of people dressed in olive green clothing saying “Viva Fidel.” If my journalism can help in breaking down those stereotypes, I do think it’s playing a diplomatic role. It’s helping other people in other parts of the world understand that Cubans are just like any other person in the world or part of the world. And therefore, we also are entitled to the same rights and the same things that other people in parts of this planet are entitled to, such as liberty, democracy, the right to choose and things like that.
How do you deal with accountability and ethics?
14ymedio is mainly dedicated to an editorial line that is based on information and facts … But we’re also very aware that we’re living in a reality where transparency is not dominant, where information is sometimes spread in terms of rumors, not facts, where public institutions don’t really publicize their facts and figures so transparently, a society where the official press distorts the reality of the information that they put out there.
So our task is to make sure that we provide a newspaper every day that is objective, that is real, that is transparent, is much more difficult than when you operate in a society that does not have those challenges.
We also have an internal policy where we’re not just committed to truth. We are also committed to verbal non-violence. For example, if we’re referring to the Cuban government, we do not say “the Cuban dictatorship,” we say “the Cuban government.” Perhaps after they read the entire article, the reader himself or herself might assume that the government is a dictatorship, but those are their own conclusions, not ours.
What do you hope to accomplish while you’re here?
I have many, many goals. If I can accomplish 10 percent of all that I have set out for, I’m going to be very happy. I want to leverage and take advantage of this academic environment, the collaboration between students and professors, to become a better journalist. I also hope that my stay here can increase the visibility and grow 14ymedio with new audiences so that it’s similar to the likes of similar platforms and newspapers around the world.
I also want to make sure I have lectures and seminars and talk to students about how to use communication in closed societies, in that I think I have a very practical experience where I can give quite a lot because I have the experience of how in closed societies, in the worst conditions of connectivity, one can use social media to amplify one’s voice.
On a personal level, I’m very interested in being surrounded by and exploring the international aspect and the multiculturality that Georgetown has to offer. And if I can leave here doing lectures in English, that would be fantastic.

Amid talk of D.C. statehood, outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder brought increased attention to the District’s lack of voting representation in Congress in a speech to the Congressional Black Caucus on Sept. 26.
Holder, a D.C. resident, gave the speech a day after announcing his plans to resign and focused on ensuring voting rights in states across the country.
“It is long past time for every citizen to be afforded his or her full responsibilities and full rights, including the more than 600,000 taxpayers who, like me, live in the District of Columbia and still have no voting representation in Congress,” Holder said.
According to CNN, Holder said that he would remain Attorney General until his successor is confirmed.
Currently, the District of Columbia has one non-voting delegate in the House and no representatives in the Senate. The District has three electoral votes in presidential elections, but Congress has overriding jurisdiction over the city’s affairs.
Additionally, Eleanor Holmes-Norton (D-D.C.) and Mayor Vincent Gray testified in favor of statehood before a Senate committee Sept. 15, the first hearing on the issue in over 20 years.
The struggle for D.C. voting rights has been caught up in politics. In 2010, Democrats abandoned a bill that would have granted the District a voting seat in the House of Representatives when it became clear that part of the bill would repeal many of the city’s gun control laws.
Since the passage of the 23rd Amendment in 1961 granted D.C. residents the right to vote in presidential elections, the city has never voted for a Republican candidate. Georgetown University College Democrats President Chandini Jha (COL ’16) pointed to the Democratic makeup of the District as an impediment to meaningful change.
“From a purely political aspect, there must obviously be considerations given the fact that D.C. has always voted very blue,” Jha said. “To be truthful, I think there is a political calculation, and I think that’s why there is opposition along partisan lines.”
D.C. resident and Georgetown professor of government Stephen Wayne agreed.
“The reason there is no change today is because Republicans see it as a Democratic seat,” he said. “I don’t see this going anywhere. I think the best we can do is our license plate.”
The D.C. license plate reads “Taxation without Representation,” a rallying cry for the voting rights movement.
Washington residents pay some of the highest federal taxes per capita in the country. In the 2012 fiscal year, D.C. residents paid $32,811.79 in revenue per capita, much higher than the U.S. average revenue per capita of $7,918.73.
Jha did not think that the tax discrepancy was the most compelling argument for Congressional representation.
“The federal government directly helps us with our D.C. Council and some governmental expenses, so it is hard to say that we don’t have representation from a purely economic standpoint,” she said.
Wayne said that he thought the movement was doomed to fail, regardless of whether D.C. aimed to gain representation through statehood or through a constitutional amendment.
“We can’t even get policy through Congress, let alone two-thirds of Congress and three-quarters of the states to vote for that,” Wayne said. “Politically, people are self-interested rather than idealistic.”
With the political gridlock, D.C. area residents, including Wayne, shared Holder’s frustration.
“Obviously, those of us who live here would like to see voting representation,” Wayne said. “After all, I teach a course about Congress and I can’t even vote for Congress.”
Aidan Kenney (COL ’18) felt disconnected from federal politics despite living in the nation’s capital.
“I think it is unfair and arbitrary,” Kenney said. “It is absurd that a politically engaged city like D.C. is left out of federal politics.”
Nationwide, there is overwhelming popular support for D.C. voting rights. A poll conducted by D.C. Vote, an advocacy group focused on the issue, found that 82 percent of Americans favored such a measure. Supporters of both parties were in favor of D.C. voting rights. According to the poll, 77 percent of self-identified Republicans and 87 percent of self-identified Democrats voiced support for D.C. voting rights.
Jha hoped that the difficulty in bringing full representation to D.C. would lead students to become more engaged in government locally.
“It would be great to see more students involved in advocacy,” Jha said. “We should focus more on educating and encouraging students to get involved in local government.”

A group of 232 Georgetown alumni have signed a letter of concern in response to the Georgetown University Police Department’s removal of H*yas for Choice from a public sidewalk at 37th and O streets Sept. 23.
Erin Matson (COL ’02), former vice president of the National Organization for Women, organized the letter, which was sent to University President John J. DeGioia, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and Associate Vice President of Student Affairs Jeanne Lord, Monday morning.
“I wanted to make sure that the administration knew that it wasn’t just H*yas for Choice, but a strong alumni community that stands behind them as well,” Matson said.
Matson said that DeGioia’s chief of staff already responded, assuring her that the message would be passed along to the university president.
In the letter to DeGioia, Matson wrote about both times GUPD removed H*yas for Choice during peaceful protests this year: once on Sept. 23, while the university bestowed an honorary degree upon Donald Cardinal Wuerl, Archbishop of Washington, and once during the Cardinal O’Connor Conference on Life in January.
GUPD has since apologized for mistakenly forcing H*yas for Choice to abandon their most recent protest, which was outside the front gates, but the policies that led to the removal of the group from Healy Circle last January still stand.
“On both occasions, the students were quietly presenting an alternative view to official church teachings by advocating for reproductive rights, women’s rights and equal rights regardless of sexual orientation,” Matson wrote in the petition.
In the petition, Matson called upon the university to allow for the representation of many points of view in discussions about social issues.
“These issues matter. They are both moral and practical,” Matson wrote. “This is an age of social change and political polarization on matters pertaining to sexuality and human rights on a national scale, as well as an international scale. Georgetown has long played a leadership role in policy debates as the premier institution of higher learning in our nation’s capital. It can no longer be that and do so if only one view may be stated.”
Last Friday, the Georgetown University Student Association Speech and Expression Committee held a meeting to address the incident and the university’s enforcement of the free speech policy. Though the university released an updated Speech and Expression Policy in May, the committee is continuing to develop how exactly these new procedures will be enforced.
“The newer goal, following the work with GUSA and the Committee over the past year, is to see that the Committee is well-prepared to hear and respond to concerns and complaints from members of our community,” Olson wrote in an email to The Hoya. H*yas for Choice president Abby Grace (SFS ’16) attended the meeting and said the main issue now is a lack of education that results in miscommunications regarding the details of university policy. She said that while she finds the Speech and Expression Policy changes promising, the university must remain committed to following through with its language.
The updated policy, which was released in May, includes the designation of the lobby of the Leavey Center, Regents Lawn and the Healey Family Student center as “public squares” for tabling, permits protests anywhere on campus so long as protestors abide by university policies and outlines a process for the Speech and Expression Committee to overturn misapplications of the policy.
“We think that the administrators are pretty committed to holding that up, but perhaps bringing these grandiose claims down to actual implementation is where we are actually finding the struggle right now,” Grace said.
Chandini Jha (COL ’16), a senior adviser of the Georgetown University Student Association and appointed member of the committee, echoed Grace’s call for increased education and more concrete plans. She added that administrators said they would be relying on student input throughout this process.
“We want to make sure that it goes into effect in order to have an impact on students,” Jha said.
In addition to educating the entire Georgetown community on policy, the committee also has plans to develop a specific timeline of training and maps of designated free speech zones on campus.
Grace added that she believes the successful implementation of the updated Speech and Expression Policy would enhance the Georgetown educational experience.
“It’s important to me that the community that taught me how to think also allows future students to enjoy the same level of expressions,” Grace said.

Epicurean and Company has begun to break even in its venture to remain open 24 hours a day, six days a week, during the academic year. Although the restaurant still has not made a profit since round-the-clock hours were implemented in September 2013, it has begun to attract a larger late-night crowd, according to Epicurean owner Chang Wook Chon.
Last fall, Chon told The Hoya that he estimated that an average of about 80 customers ate at the restaurant during its off-peak hours of 11 p.m. through 2 a.m.
Now, Chon says that Epicurean averages about 300 customers between 10:30 p.m. and 6 a.m. on weekends. During the week, however, that number dwindles to around 100 customers between the same hours.
Chon said that he keeps Epicurean open 24 hours not to drive a profit but to build a sense of community at Georgetown.
“I’m very happy about that, that I can contribute to the community,” Chon said. “I’m not looking for a profit. As long as I can break even, even if I am losing a little bit of money, I love to do it.”
However, Chon said that he was hoping to speak with the university in the near future and rework the terms of his contract so that Epicurean would close at 10:30 p.m. on Sunday nights and at 2:00 a.m. on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights while remaining open 24 hours during the weekend.
Vice President of Auxiliary Service Joelle Wiese said that the university is not currently considering changing Epicurean’s operational hours.
“Students and the overall community seem to like the flexibility that Epicurean offers with the menu and the hours of operation,” Wiese wrote in an email. “At this point we are not looking to change the hours of operation.”
Currently, Epicurean closes at 10:30 p.m. on Sundays and reopens at 6:30 a.m. on Monday mornings.
“The staff I have, they have to work overnight. It’s a very tough job,” Chon said.
The night manager at Epicurean is in process of recording the number of patrons the restaurant experiences on a nightly basis. At the end of the semester, Chon plans to analyze the data before discussing any potential schedule changes with the university.
The restaurant originally switched to a round-the-clock schedule as a way to bring more students back to campus, according to Chon and Wiese. Chon said that prior to the all-night schedule, students did not have a place to go on campus late in the evening, leading them to hang out on the street and make noise.
Rodrigo Mercado (MSB ’17) often studies in Epicurean during the week in the middle of the night, and said that there are usually only a few other students in the restaurant when he is there.
“Compared to the weekends, it’s not a lot of people. I usually see maybe four or five people studying there until around 4 or 5 a.m.,” Mercado said.
“I think we can contain those students over here. I think that so far it has worked out,” Chon said.
Wiese added that Epicurean’s late night hours not only provide options at night but give residents in Darnall added convenience.
“I’ve talked to some of the students living in Darnall, and they love the fact that they can walk right downstairs to Epi.,” Wiese said.“It’s one of those things that just has got its own appeal.”
Darnall resident Jack Romine (COL ’18) said he appreciates the accessibility and community atmosphere at the restaurant.
“Epicurean really is just the one good part about living in Darnall,” Romine said. “If you’re writing a paper or are up until 4 a.m. doing your homework, you can always just go down to Epicurean after and have a quesadilla. Or if you’re out on a Friday or Saturday night, Epicurean is always there to welcome you back into its warm embrace of greasy food.”

The university announced a four-year on-campus housing guarantee for students with high financial need this fall, in a move that is expected to help around 150 seniors with high financial need.
Included in the announcement were other housing eligibility changes related to the three-year on-campus housing requirement that will be implemented beginning with the Class of 2017.
The Georgetown University Student Association worked alongside the Office of Residential Living and the Office of Student Financial Services to ensure that students who receive financial aid that covers housing costs will be guaranteed a place to live on campus during their senior year, beginning next fall.
Previously, these students had no choice but to live in off-campus housing if they did not receive housing eligibility.
“Especially for students with high financial need who relied on on-campus housing, losing that eligibility means scrambling to find inexpensive housing,” GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said. “Though the university provides some opportunities to cover the costs of off-campus rent, [it is] certainly not the kind of security and stability that eligibility for on-campus housing provides.”
Students who demonstrate high financial need will follow the same eligibility process as other students.
“The financial aid office will determine which students out of that list qualify for high financial need, and then they’ll send it back to housing and housing will give them eligibility automatically,” GUSA Vice President Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15) said.
Executive Director for Residential Services Patrick Killilee said that he does not think that this new policy will increase the number of seniors living on campus.
“There are still a limited number of seniors we can accept. Typically we have had 500 seniors opting to live on campus in the past, and we expect that number to stay the same,” Killilee said.
Joone Wang (COL ’17) receives a full scholarship from the university and said that the new housing policy came as a relief.
“I think the new policy is great. Now I don’t have to go through the hassle of looking for housing off campus,” Wang said.
With this new policy in place, students receiving aid must apply via Housing-at-a-Glance between Oct. 6 and 17 of this year.
The four-year housing guarantee will only affect seniors, as all juniors are guaranteed on-campus housing eligibility due to the new three-year on-campus requirement.
“The [three-year] policy came in two folds — one to fill the new number of beds and second, to create a vibrant residential living experience for students, so that the students living on campus will have that as part of their Georgetown undergraduate experience,” Killilee said.
However, many members of the Class of 2017 were upset when this policy was announced last spring, as they were not aware of it until midway through their freshman year.
Sophomore Sarah Barney (MSB ’17) said she was planning on living on campus for three years, but said that it places a burden on students who were unaware of the policy when applying to college.
“My grade entered Georgetown thinking we’d only be living on campus for two years, but then after our freshman year, this new policy was thrown at us. I think a lot of people in my grade, myself included, think they should have ushered this in with the 2018 freshman class instead,” Barney said.
Additionally, students are concerned with an additional change to the housing process for juniors participating in fall-2015 study abroad programs, as students going abroad in the fall are no longer eligible to enter the housing lottery.
While Barney was undeterred by the new three-year requirement, she said this change will affect her when she returns from study abroad in 2016.
“This new housing program makes it really hard to study abroad junior fall because I can’t enter the housing lottery,” Barney said. “Next year, instead of having a sophomore fill in for my apartment space, I’d get put into a dorm rather than an apartment.”
Tezel and Jikaria have pledged to work with administrators to change the study-abroad housing policy.
“We are still uneasy about the eligibility process for juniors who plan to study abroad in fall 2015, and have voiced this concern to the appropriate administrators,” Tezel and Jikaria wrote in a statement.

The rise of social messaging application Yik Yak on college campuses around the country has sparked concerns over cyberbullying, racism and sexual harassment.
Yik Yak is an anonymous forum that allows posts of 200 characters or fewer to be viewed by anyone within a two-mile radius. Users respond by “upvoting” posts they like and “downvoting” or reporting posts they dislike or find offensive; when a post receives enough downvotes, it is taken down. Designed for use by college students, the application is blocked at 85 percent of middle and high schools.
However, the anonymous nature of the application has raised concerns from universities. Norwich University in Vermont banned the application’s use on campus over cyberbullying, while Colgate University students were incited by racist posts on the application to stage a sit-in protest.
Yik Yak’s Lead Community Developer Cam Mullen stressed that Yik Yak does everything in its power to eradicate bullying and offensive posts, though he acknowledged it does occur.
“On Yik Yak, we do have instances of harassment or bullying, and it’s something we take really seriously and are constantly working against,” Mullen said. “If there is an immediate threat, for example a shooting threat, we immediately jump on that and will often contact police even before police contact us, and we work with them to try to track down this person,”
Since the company does not have any other identifying information about users, Mullen said that the company identifies threats using GPS locations and previous posts to find users.
University of Maryland Law School professor Danielle Citron, author of “Hate Crimes in Cyberspace,” said that the application’s self-regulation is not enough to protect users.
“When abusive content like rape threats, or privacy invasions, defamation appear on their services they are not legally responsible. They’re immune from liability. So they have no legal obligation,” she said.
Citron pointed at Yik Yak as a possible perpetuator of rape culture. She discussed an incident where a UMD student brought up a Yik Yak post that threatened a female guest speaker with rape.
“What followed were other threads suggesting she should be raped, with kind of graphic descriptions of how,” she said. “I imagine if it’s reported as abuse, they take it down, but sometimes the harm is already done. If you think about it, a rape threat is frightening to someone. And so, yes you take it down, but you take it down two days later and the person is pretty scared.”
Georgetown professor of psychology Sandra Calvert, specializing in research on information technologies and social behavior, pointed to a University of California, Los Angeles study that found that racist comments and attacks are more likely in online chat rooms when those chat rooms are unmonitored.
“I think that anytime you’re anonymous that one thing that happens is it gives you a certain element of freedom to say whatever you want because there are no consequences,” Calvert said. “So anytime you go into these public forums and there’s nobody watching you or kind of holding some kind of standards of appropriate behavior, then people are left to their own devices. So it can bring out some of the darker side of human interaction.”
However, Calvert noted that most comments [on public forums] had no real effects beyond the virtual world.
“A lot of it is innocuous,” she said.
Students who used the app agreed with Calvert, but did not see the app as a perpetuator of cyberbullying.
“I’ve seen offensive posts, but I think you take them for what they are. At least I’ve never felt really offended by any of them,” said Daniel Fain (COL ’18), who downloaded the app his second week at Georgetown. “If I felt like it actually named anyone personally, I think you can flag it as inappropriate, but I haven’t seen any that have actually marked anyone personally.”
Christina Graziano (MSB ’17) was similarly unconcerned about the app, faulting the people who misused the technology for any alarming content.
“I just think there are a couple people taking advantage of its anonymous nature and going too far with it. Like every app, someone goes too far with something,” Graziano said. “In general, I think it’s a really good outlet for people to be witty and funny, without a fear of being favorited or liked enough.”
Even with the general lack of concern on the campus, Citron urged students to understand the issues posed by social media through open discourse.
“I think the more we talk about it, the more we teach people how powerful these tools are and how it impacts people’s lives,” she said. “Having these conversations [is] incredibly important.”

People need to remember that platforms like Yik Yak are just that – platforms. If you substitute in any other method of communication, you start to see the bizarre nature of wanting to block or get rid of the platform. There is a problem with *some* of the people that use Yik Yak, not with Yik Yak itself. There is inherent value in anonymous communication.

Counterterrorism expert Jonathan Schanzer said Palestinian politics are overlooked in the field of Middle Eastern studies in a lecture in White-Gravenor Hall on Wednesday.
The event was co-sponsored by the Georgetown Journal of International Affairs and the Georgetown Israel Alliance.
During his talk, Schanzer emphasized the fact that many people who study the Israel-Palestine conflict do so in a one-sided manner.
“Most people study the Middle East by the Israeli perspective, or the perspective of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Some people might have studied the Palestinian system, but that is extremely rare,” Schanzer said.
GIA Co-President Jessica Tannenbaum (COL ’16), a staff writer for The Guide, said that she appreciated Schanzer’s perspective. 
“I think it was important for him to shift the focus just from looking at the Israeli perspective, to looking at the Palestinian perspective as well, because in order to understand this conflict, we need to look at both sides,” Tannenbaum said.
Schanzer also said he believes that having an understanding of the Palestinian political system is crucial to developing an understanding of the region, emphasizing the interconnectedness of the Israel-Palestine conflict and other major issues ongoing in the Middle East.
“The term that is used right now, a derisive term, is called linkage. If you just solved the Israel-Palestinian conflict you might be able to prevent Iran from going nuclear, the civil war in Syria and the tumult from the Arab Spring,” Schanzer said. “You might be able to prevent many things by just getting down to the core of providing the Palestinians with the state that they so desire and have been agitating for since the 1940s.”
Schanzer noted the division of the Palestinian government and how the two-state solution, which proposes the creation of two separate and autonomous states of Israel and Palestine, ignores that the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are two distinct entities separated by a barrier that Palestinians are virtually unable to cross.
“You have the Gaza strip being controlled by the Hamas and the West Bank by Fatah,” Schanzer said. “These are two separate governments, two separate funding sources, two separate police and security apparatus. These two states have not been able to agree on anything, and yet, all we have been talking about in Washington is a two-state solution.”
Event attendee Sydney Jean Gottfried (COL ’17) said that she felt like this distinction cleared up a misconception that many Americans have about Palestine.
“I thought that it was really interesting to bring to light how in Palestine there are two sides, with the Hamas and the Fatah and I think that most people don’t see that,” Gottfried said. “They just see Israel and Palestine and it can be hard to understand that within Palestine there is not a united front.”
Ian Philbrick (COL ’17), GJIA’s undergraduate online executive editor, said he agrees that there is a problem with how we narratively frame the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“The way that it is depicted in the media and the way we understand the situation as policymakers or even students is not necessary true to the situation on the ground,” Philbrick said. “There is a very dangerous disconnect between what is actually happening and the policy that we recommend.”
Schanzer called for the opening up of the Palestinian political system in order to make room for innovative leaders.
“The bottom line is that Palestinians across the board don’t like their leadership and there does not appear to be any leaders in the making,” Schanzer said. “Even if there were elections tomorrow, it is impossible to tell who would be the next layer of leadership. We are looking for the next Martin Luther King or the next Mahatma Gandhi. We need to open up the political space, and this is something that we continue to ignore.”
During a question and answer session that followed the lecture, Schanzer addressed the issues of terrorism and the threat of the Islamic State group.
“There is a common denominator across ISIS, Hamas and al-Qaida, which is a radical brand of Islam,” Schanzer said. “This is not Islam itself, it is an interpretation of Islam, which the majority of Muslims reject. I believe that the biggest fight that we are all going to face is this ideology, the fact that ISIS is drawing numbers of people and has such an allure.”
Ari Goldstein (COL ’18), who attended the event, said he was satisfied with the objective view that Schanzer presented in his lecture.
“So much of the narrative around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is driven by biased and emotional content in the mainstream media and so, hearing from an objective, experienced, research fellow like Dr. Schanzer gives a greater degree of legitimacy to the discussion and allows us to focus on what is really important,” Goldstein said.

“Schanzer called for the opening up of the Palestinian political system in order to make room for innovative leaders.”
Hey, it is open.  They voted in Hamas.  They are living with the results.
Hey, it is open.  They voted in Abbas.  He is now serving as a dictator serving his 9th year in a four year term.  
Can’t help stupid.

Sigrid Kaag, the United Nations special coordinator of the mission to eliminate chemical weapons in Syria, spoke on the challenges and successes encountered in the midst of the Syrian Civil War in an event hosted by the Center for Security Studies in Riggs Library on Tuesday.
Colin Kahl, an associate professor in Georgetown’s Security Studies Program, who was recently tapped to serve as National Security Advisor to Vice President Joe Biden, began the event by providing background information on the use of chemical weapons in Syria that began a year ago when Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used them to attack Damascus.
“While chemical weapons had been used previously by the regime … this marked a major escalation in the regime’s brutality, and it set in motion a series of events, including the prospect of a possible U.S. military strike on Syrian facilities,” Kahl said.
He said that in September 2013, Syria agreed to dismantle its weapons and place them under international control, in exchange for a guarantee that the United States would not attack Syria.
That 2013 agreement led to the appointment of Kaag, who began her speech by discussing the importance of the framework agreement, which prompted Syria to declare its number of chemical weapons.
“[Syria] declared, for the first time, what is considered to be its chemical weapons program, which was always assumed by the international community to be quite significant, sophisticated and quite large, and to pose a significant threat to the region and to the civilians of the region,” Kaag said.
This initial declaration, she said, prompted the creation of a body to ensure the elimination of chemical weapons, eventually realized through the joint mission between the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
Kaag went on to discuss the process of destroying chemical weapons. According to Kaag, the unique situation of having to destroy chemical weapons during wartime complicated this step.
“Normally, the state party would destroy the material on its soil in its own country,” Kaag said. “However, conditions of war are hardly the ones in which you can continue to reliably implement destruction of chemical weapons material. The fear is always that it could be used again, and secondly that it could fall in the wrong hands.”
Kaag and her team packed the weapons into The Cape Ray, a U.S. ship with a reactor that neutralizes chemical materials. She said she felt as though the mission was successful, and that it helped the United Nations Security Council unify under a common goal.
“This was one of those opportunities where you’re in the field and you had to demonstrate we are the voice, the channel, the means of the international community,” Kaag said. “We don’t have time and we cannot afford to quarrel over little issues among ourselves. … We are here to serve, we are here to serve the Syrian people, those who had been victims, those who suffered.”
Kaag concluded her speech by reiterating that there is still work to be done down the road in Syria. “Our intent has always been to make Syria somewhat safer, to do what we can for the people of Syria and the region, and truly hoping that the political process can be inclusive and that the humanitarian and early recovery tracks will really, truly be there to get people back on track,” Kaag said.
Leah Metoudi (COL ’17) attended the event, and asked a question about certain hangars and tunnels in Syria that had not yet been destroyed by the joint mission. Kaag replied that they are expected to be destroyed by April.
“That was one of the main reasons I came here, I was curious to know if they had been destroyed in terms of completing this mission so that was one of the things I found really interesting, that they are actually carrying out this mission and it’s going to be completed this April,” Metoudi said.
Julia Eckelmann (SFS ’18), also attended the event and said she enjoyed learning more about the security situation.
“As someone potentially interested in security studies, I thought it was really interesting to hear firsthand how long the process of diplomacy was, and in this case how little time it actually took,” Eckelmann said. “She continued to point out how rare it was that they did meet this short deadline.”

In commemoration of the lives lost during this summer’s conflict between Israel and Hamas, J Street U Georgetown hosted an apolitical candlelight vigil in Red Square in an attempt to humanize the usually politicized debate.
With the media coverage of the violence filled with statistics, J Street U wanted to focus on empathy for the human loss.
“Now many of us here, myself included, found this simple and human idea of empathy and compassion incredibly difficult to express this summer. The intense polarization of an already highly political and politicized issue often prohibited any sense of sympathy for the other side and perpetuated the idea that any such sympathy was a sign of wavering loyalty and betrayal,” J Street U Co-President Katelyn McNelis (SFS ’15) said. “Tonight we recognize that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, while inherently political, transcends politics.”
Although J Street U, which promotes a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, does have a political stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, they found it important that the event eschewed a political nature.
“We also do have strong political stances that we are not scared to take, but for this event we wanted to kind of put that aside and show that there was a human aspect to this that wasn’t really being shown this summer,” McNelis said. “All that was being shown was destruction and rockets but they weren’t showing the actual humanity behind what happened after and before the destruction.”
The event included narrative accounts of life for people affected by the violence. One story included that of a family bombed whose father was worried about the overwhelming fear of his children.
“‘I have learned from past experience not to let the kids see the damage that the rockets cause because it can be very traumatic,’” Noah Buyon (COL ’17), a member of the organization’s board of directors, said as a narrator.
The event was also an attempt to show that even in a polarized debate, it is possible to rise above politics to a focus on the human aspect.
“People tend to see this conflict in black and white terms and there’s a good side and a bad side and this event kind of marks a transcendence of that worldview in my mind. The way I see it, if even one person dies, it’s one person too many and so this is a very nice way of building off of that sentiment,” Buyon said.
The inability to empathize with the conflict on a more human level was in large part due to the media coverage.
“When I could see myself following the news, it was just so hard to really put it in a human perspective because after a while all you saw was numbers and all you saw was the amount of rocket attacks and the number of people killed and you kind of lost the idea that that number was a person,” McNelis said.
Mitchel Hochberg (SFS ’15), who attended the vigil, said that is gave him an opportunity to reflect on the events of the summer.
“Discussion of last summer’s conflict became incredibly polarized,” Hochberg wrote in an email. “Having a safe space to set that aside helped me remember that humanity and compassion should drive our response to needless violence.”

Are people who support Hamas akin to people who supported the Nazis?
Seems to me they are.  
Nazis destroyed all the Jews of Europe.  Hamas never stops talking about destroying Jews.  
Nazis depicted Jews as beneath contempt just as Hamas does.  Nazis blamed Jews for all their problems and so does Hamas.
Seems to me the only difference is Hamas does not have the military required to really kill off all the Jews of Israel.  If they did have these weapons everyone knows they would use them as indiscriminately as the Nazis did.
I wonder what sort of person supports an organization that is today’s Nazis.  What moral and intellectual blindness do these Nazi worshippers suffer from?

Georgetown University Police Department Chief of Police Jay Gruber answered student questions on topics ranging from freedom of speech to the new LiveSafe app at the fourth GUPD Roundtable Tuesday in the Healey Family Student Center Social Room.
During the event, which was sponsored by the Georgetown University Student Association, students discussed safety concerns and campus policies with Gruber.
“One of the most important things for me is to get feedback from the students,” Gruber said. “I’m here to serve the students. I really enjoy engaging students and getting their input, their information and feedback.”
The roundtable attracted more than 20 students, the largest GUPD roundtable turnout to date, according to GUSA Secretary of Student Health and Safety Nora West (SFS ‘15).
Throughout the roundtable West asked Gruber questions, which were submitted online by students prior to the meeting.
Much of the discussion focused around last week’s removal of a H*yas for Choice table outside of the front gates by a GUPD officer. The group was situated on the corners of 37th and O streets in a protest of the university’s bestowal of an honorary degree upon Donald Cardinal Wuerl, due to his beliefs about LGBTQ rights and women’s health.
“We screwed up,” Gruber said. “It never should have happened, never should have happened. I apologized to the president of H*yas for Choice, and I let the student body know I apologized. It was wrong.”
Gruber said that GUPD does not enforce any D.C. street laws and that GUPD was acting outside of its limits when it removed the H*yas for Choice table.
“The speech and expression policy didn’t even have any place outside the gates of the university,” Gruber said. “I could have three people naked carrying signs in the middle of 37th and O protesting the president. I don’t have a dog in the fight.”
In response to the incident, the Center for Student Engagement will be training the GUPD leadership staff on Oct. 8, according to Gruber. Additionally, every GUPD officer ranked sergeant and below will be trained in the university’s speech and expression policy in the coming months.
Gruber also used the roundtable as an opportunity to talk about the university’s LiveSafe app, a mobile crime app that allows students to report tips to GUPD by either streaming video or by sending a text.
According to Gruber, 900 people have signed up since the app launched at the start of New Student Orientation in August, yet Gruber noted that he had hoped that there would be 2,000 to 3,000 sign-ups by this time.
Another topic brought up at the roundtable was the SafeRides program. Gruber said that a number of improvements have been implemented in order to help bring transparency and greater accessibility to the program by releasing an update to the LiveSafe app that will allow students to request a SafeRide pickup and track the van while it is en route.
“It’s a program that I have,” Gruber said regarding SafeRides. “And any program that I have to serve students, I need it to run well. And its not running 100 percent right now, but I guarantee you it is something we’re working on.”

Eight months after its launch, the Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation has taken steps to entrench itself in the Washington, D.C.,  community and to increase its interactions with the student community at Georgetown.
Beeck Center Director Sonal Shah, former deputy assistant to the president and founding director of the White House Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation, noted that the center had engaged with organizations in D.C. to widen its social impact.
This summer, the center was approached by the Department of Education to collaborate on President Barack Obama’s new initiative My Brother’s Keeper, a push to close the opportunity gap that young men of color face.
“It gave students a lot of exposure to senior officials in government,” Shah said.
“Data is always seen as a top down thing: Here is what the government is going to do for you. … But [this could] change the conversation about how can you use the data to do something different for yourself.”
Work on the initiative involved several meetings with Georgetown students and professors, D.C. community members, high school students and teachers and principals from Ward 7 and Ward 8. Last week several groups from the team presented their updates to Jim Shelton, the executive director of the My Brother’s Keeper initiative.
“None of us went in with an idea of what the right answer was, what we went in with was an idea that if we put some interesting people together some new ideas would come out of it, and that’s what social innovation is about: how do we think about the same problems in a different way,” Shah said.
The center has aimed to expand its impact on campus as well. Paul Schmitz, the former director of Public Allies, an organization focused on encouraging leadership among young adults in low-income communities, joined the center as the Innovator in Residence.
Schmitz leads a seminar called “Leadership for Social Change,” the first session of which discussed 25 individuals surrounding Martin Luther King Jr., each of whom had to successfully fulfill their role in order for King to emerge as a national figure. The seminar is open to any students who want to join.
In addition to working with the wider D.C. community, the center has also attempted to engage more with Georgetown students, recently creating a board of 12 students to help design programming for the center.
“We want to be cross disciplinary and we want to work with people, we don’t want to be seen as a stand-alone center, so if we can do something with the Center for Social Justice, or the Berkley Center or [GU] Women in Leadership … we would be happy to work with anyone,” Shah said.
The Beeck Center has plans to participate in a competition sponsored by the White House Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation.
Additionally, Shah said that University of Southern California American Muslim Civic Leadership Institute Director and Co-Founder Nadia Roumani will lead a guest seminar on design thinking.
The center has also forged a relationship with the Social Innovation and Public Service Fund, which has a $1.25 million endowment, to invest in projects that have ranged from starting community gardens in D.C., to building cooking stoves in Rwanda.
SIPS Fund Executive Director Naman Trivedi (SFS ’16) said he hopes that the fund’s relationship with the Beeck Center would expand opportunities for grants to be offered.
The SIPS Fund partnered with the Beeck Center to co-sponsor a Social Innovation Competition in February.
Additionally, SIPS has given out grants ranging in size from $300 to $13,000 to support students’ social innovation projects in D.C. and around the world.
“In the future we may try to start talking to the Beeck Center about incubating some of our projects because the Beeck Center is very well connected, not only at Georgetown, but also in D.C. as far as nonprofits go,” Trivedi said.
Caroline Egan (COL ’15), co-chair of the Beeck Center’s student board, said that she hopes that as the center moved forward, it would engage students in entrepreneurship and create sustained relationships.
“We get driven into tracts that are deemed successful, be that medicine, law, consulting, politics, etc.,” Egan said.“What happens unfortunately is you have all these bright people who only go down certain paths and what we are hoping to do at the Beeck Center is essentially help them see that there are other things out there, things that you may not at first think about but are equally lucrative and much more engaging.”

The Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs at Georgetown, already partnered with Notre Dame, recently created a trifecta with the Institute for Studies of Religion at Baylor University in hope of promoting religious freedom through academic dialogues.
Thomas Farr and Timothy Shah, Georgetown professors and the director and associate director of the Religious Freedom Project, respectively, initiated this alliance between the Catholic and Baptist universities with Baylor professor Byron Johnson.
Last December, Georgetown and Baylor cohosted a conference in Rome called “Christianity and Freedom: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives,” and the two universities sponsored a symposium the day before the Supreme Court began oral arguments about the Affordable Care Act’s contraception mandate in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.
Farr said that the partnership will help each community address questions about what religious freedom entails and its importance in society and on campus.
“The partnership is designed to study religious freedom — what it is, and why it is important to individuals and societies — and to disseminate knowledge about its relationships to other political, social, economic, intellectual and religious goods,” Farr wrote in an email. “For example, is religious freedom necessary for the consolidation and durability of democracy? For economic growth? For the equality of women in law and culture? If so, those are powerful reasons for a society to embrace this fundamental human right.”
Johnson, the founding director of Baylor’s Institute for Studies of Religion, said that the partnership uses both conferences and research papers to raise academic awareness.
“Conferences [are] one way [to raise awareness]. The other is to write important papers and publish them in top journals. … You always try to publish top-scholarship high-quality journalism and to write books that colleagues will read and listen to,” Johnson said. “And we hope that research will show that religious freedom is tied to a bunch of different things, like the spread of democracy, the spread of unions and economic development. … Let the research do the talking.”
Farr said that this partnership stemmed from a personal friendship.
“The partnership was the brainchild of professor Johnson, professor Shah and myself,” Farr wrote. “We had known and admired each other’s work for years, and were looking for a way to collaborate on an issue — religious freedom — we all believe is vital for our nation and the world.”
Johnson echoed the sentiment of the partnership’s natural outgrowth from past cooperation and shared interest.
“As most things revolve around relationships, I’ve been a friend of Tom Farr and Tim Shah for many years. We’ve worked together before,” Johnson said. “Just out of conversations, we realized that we have common interests and one of those interests is religious freedom. We just thought, instead of working together occasionally, we should work together more regularly.”
Both Farr and Johnson mentioned the unusual collaboration between Catholic and Baptist universities considering the historical tension between Catholics and Protestants.
“Baylor University is the largest Protestant research university in the world, with a strong and vibrant Baptist identity,” Farr wrote, “Frankly, we like the idea of a Baptist-Catholic collaboration on religious freedom. When we met the Pope in 2013, he clearly liked this aspect of the Religious Freedom Project.”
Kelly Thomas (SFS ’15), who has worked as a research assistant on the Religious Freedom Project since last fall, also showed her support for this interfaith collaboration.
“I like the idea that it’s Catholic and Baptist. I think it’s not just the Catholics fighting the government again. It discusses issues that many people feel,” Thomas said. “And also Baylor is a massive research university. … Baylor University made a huge gift in getting more resources to the work we do.”
Apart from the two-day conference in Rome, where members of the Georgetown community met with Pope Francis, the two universities co-sponsored a half-day conference this past March in Washington, D.C., called “Everybody’s Business: The Legal, Economic and Political Implications of Religious Freedom.” These conferences have been positively received, and the next one, entitled “Philosophy of Religion,” will be held at Georgetown from Oct. 9 to Oct. 11.
Thomas Banchoff, vice president for global engagement and director of the Berkley Center, emphasized the goal of this partnership to raise awareness of the necessity of religious freedom.
“The partnership is an excellent opportunity to deepen scholarship, debate and public understanding about religious freedom.” Banchoff wrote in an email. “Through research, teaching and outreach activities, two leading centers at two leading universities are raising awareness of the critical importance of religious freedom in today’s world, at a time when religious persecution and violence is on the rise.
Paradoxically, this partnership has sparked controversy about the separation of church and state, since the project, which is focused on religious freedom, is headed by two institutions associated with conservative religions.
“I see efforts like this as just another attempt to erode support for separation of church and state — albeit dressed up in a fancy academic gown,” Rob Boston, director of communications for Americans United for Separation of Church and State in an article in Deseret News National.
Farr refutes this claim.
“The separation of church and state is designed to protect the church from the state, not vice versa,” Farr wrote. “In the U.S. Constitution, the ban on the establishment of religion was intended, along with the free exercise clause, to ensure the active participation of all religious individuals and groups in American political life — on a basis of full equality with each other. Today that understanding is under threat from those who would privatize religion, and remove it from the public life of our nation.”
Johnson stressed the partnership’s embrace of pluralism and talked about some people’s unreasonable fears and stereotypes of proselytizing.
“We favor pluralism,” Johnson said. “The more voices the better, the more religious voices the better, no matter how diverse they are. So whenever someone wants to silence some of those voices, it concerns us. We think atheists should have just much a voice as any religious group should have.”
Katherine Landau (SFS ’17), president of Georgetown’s Secular Students Alliance, also acknowledged the importance of this partnership in creating interfaith dialogue.
“Interfaith dialogue is extremely important because it’s supposed to foster understanding between different groups of people,” Landau said. “It’s supposed to get rid of the ‘us-versus-them’ type of stigma that different groups have. And that translates as well to the secular community.”
Both Farr and Johnson said they hope that this partnership will continue into the future. Johnson said that the partnership plans to reach out to administrators at Princeton University.
“I think it makes good sense,” Johnson. “When you have more of a voice, your perspective also benefits from having these other voices and minds engaged. And it brings the best [results].”
