The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority marked two financial milestones last week, announcing significant progress in its “Back2Good” reform and recovery campaign while proposing a budget for the 2019 fiscal year that will not raise fares or cut service.
Metro received access to previously restricted Federal Transit Administration grant money and finished a clean audit of its internal financial operations, a significant mark in its ongoing internal financial reform, according to WMATA General Manager and CEO Paul Wiedefeld.
“Getting Metro’s financial house in order is a significant accomplishment and involved a lot of hard work and effort over the past three years led by our Chief Financial Officer Dennis Anosike,” Wiedefeld said in a statement Oct. 25. “The finance team has implemented new processes to ensure Metro maintains strong financial controls necessary moving forward.”
The Federal Transit Administration restored WMATA’s access to $400 million in federal grants without limitations due to Metro’s improved financial status, meaning the transit agency can now receive quicker electronic reimbursements from federal grant funds for its expenditures.
Metro was previously required by the federal government to request reimbursements via paper forms in an effort to control costs starting in 2014, but the forms took months to process.
Wiedefeld also announced Oct. 26 a combined operating and capital budget proposal of $3.1 billion for the 2019 fiscal year.
The proposal requires an increase of $165 million over last year’s level of jurisdictional funding support, according to an Oct. 26 news release.
While the plan will protect customers from fare hikes and service cuts, Wiedefeld’s proposal calls for Metro to maintain strict management cost controls and increase funding for safety measures and reliability capital improvements, including delivery of its 7000-series train car and increasing fare enforcement around stations.
“This proposal builds on our success in investing capital to deliver projects that improve safety and reliability, which is critical to winning back riders,” Wiedefeld said in the news release. “This budget also doubles down on management cost controls to ensure we have squeezed the value out of every dollar that we spend delivering service to the region.”
Additionally, RSM US LLP, an external accounting firm, is expected to issue a “clean” audit of Metro, certifying Metro has not incorrectly reported information from financial statements.
Anosike said he was happy with the results of the audit but that there was still work to be done.
“We value the recommendations of the audit and continue to work to further improve our accounting and financial systems,” Anosike said in the news release. “This includes key controls on overtime, which have already been implemented.”
Metro faced criticism this year from rider advocacy groups, D.C. officials and former board members after its board of directors voted in March to raise Metrorail fares, cut service hours and eliminate bus routes to cut costs.
Metrorail fares increased by 10 cents, making the one-way minimum fare $2.25 and the new maximum $6. Non-rush hour fares rose 25 cents to $2. Metro also cut hours of operation every day of the week starting with train stations open from 5 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday, open from 5 a.m. to 1 a.m. on Friday and Saturday and open from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Sunday.
Moreover, the agency faces declining ridership, with a fall  to 624,000 trips in October 2016 from 750,000 daily trips in 2009. The board approved Wiedefeld’s recommendations earlier this year to avoid a $1.1 billion budget deficit by 2020.
Metro has faced restrictions on receiving federal grants since 2014, when consultants found that Metro had poorly organized its financial information and improperly conducted its bidding process for private contracts, potentially costing the organization millions of dollars.
Afterward, Metro had to comply with a “restricted drawdown” on federal grants, a process that prevented it from spending federal grant money in the short term. Metro borrowed money from private lenders to cover those costs while waiting for federal government reimbursement.
In December 2016, the FTA lifted the “restricted drawdown” practice for Metro on grants awarded after June 2015, but grants awarded before still faced access restrictions. At the time, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) told The Washington Post that she was happy to see the restrictions lifted.
“FTA’s diligent financial monitoring of [the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority] was essential to get the agency into acceptable financial standing with sound budget and financial controls,” Norton said. “This exercise has been a costly lesson for WMATA.”
WMATA historically has lacked a stable or dedicated funding source, relying on the D.C. government and seven other local and state jurisdictions for funding. Each year, WMATA must ask each of these governments to finance its operations based on population density, average weekday ridership and the number of stations open in each jurisdiction.

Washington, D.C., lost its bid to host the 2022 Gay Games to Hong Kong, despite Mayor Muriel Bowser’s (D) trip to Paris from Oct. 27 to Oct. 30 to lobby for the games.
Developed in 1982 as a way to bring recognition to the LGBTQ community and promote diversity in athletic competition, the Gay Games attracts thousands of competitors every four years. The 10th games will be held in Paris in 2018.
The District was among three finalist cities vying to host the 2022 games, with Hong Kong and Guadalajara, Mexico, holding the other two spots.
D.C. also lost its 2009 bid to host the 2014 Gay Games and its 2017 bid to host the 2024 Olympics.
Bowser and Brent Minor, D.C.’s Gay Games Bid Committee chair, were part of a 23-member committee that pitched their bid to the Federation of Gay Games.
Despite the loss of the bid, Bowser said she believes D.C.’s desire to host the games reflects the city’s values.
“Our bid proved that Washington, D.C. is strong not simply because we are diverse, but because we celebrate our diversity and inclusion,” Bowser wrote in an Oct. 30 news release. “As the world questions how the United States will position itself on the global stage, it is incumbent upon all of us to continue showing the world who we really are.”
Bowser was an active proponent for the bid since June, when she attended a rally in support of bringing the Gay Games to D.C. for 2022.
Minor said he looks forward to providing Hong Kong organizers with any help needed.
“While we are very disappointed that D.C. was not chosen as the host city for the 2022 Gay Games, we extend our congratulations to Hong Kong,” Minor wrote Oct. 30. “We are confident that they will be able to present a great Gay Games and we offer any assistance we can provide to make that happen.”
The Games would have brought between 12,000 to 15,000 competitors and 80,000 to 100,000 spectators, according to the D.C. Office of the City Administrator.
According to the D.C. Center for the LGBT Community, an LGBT advocacy organization, the games would have brought in between $120 and $140 million in revenue for the District.
The D.C. Government pledged $2 million in funding for the games, according to Minor. The government has not announced where the funds are now to be directed.
No Asian city has hosted the games since the event began in 1982.
Paul Choi, director of government relations for the Hong Kong 2022 bid team, told the South China Morning Post he hoped the games would be a “catalyst” for the government of Hong Kong to protect LGBT people.

The line is blurred between free speech and speech that is harmful or violent enough to be curtailed, according to four experts at a Georgetown University Free Speech Project panel Monday.
Speaking to an audience that filled Gaston Hall’s lower level, the panelists examined the aftermath of this summer’s white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va. The conversation led to little agreement among the panelists, which was what the Free Speech Project intended to achieve in its first public event, according to director and moderator Sanford Ungar.
Violent and racist undertones marked the “Unite the Right” demonstration, which turned deadly when a man drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters and killed 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injured 19 others. Experts on the law and civil rights, including U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis and Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson, analyzed the implications of the attack for free speech rights.
Former Charlottesville Chief of Police Timothy Longo, who retired in 2015 after 15 years at the law enforcement bureau’s helm, said the video of the collision struck a nerve in him.
“It’s like sitting in the sidelines, and you’re watching a team that was once yours, and you’re wishing you had to play so things would go differently,” Longo said. “It was powerless to sit there having shepherded the police department and having worked incredibly hard to win that trust where we had lost it.”
Arthur Spitzer, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington, D.C., said the protesters were fully within their First Amendment rights to express themselves.
“The Charlottesville police did not want this demonstration. I think they were hoping for some violence so they could say ‘OK, your privilege is revoked, no more demonstration, and don’t come back,’” Spitzer said. “If they come for a peaceful demonstration, Charlottesville cannot say to them legally they’re in the wrong.”
Mckesson contested the view that the protesters were coming to exercise their rights peacefully. He also drew from his experience protesting the death of Michael Brown at the hands of a Ferguson, Mo., police officer in 2014.
“I don’t know how we talk about free speech without talking about the uneven distribution of power and also the unequal enforcement,” Mckesson said. “We saw videos of the white supremacists physically pushing the police — if we had ever done that in St. Louis, we would have been shot.”
In the aftermath of the rally, Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D-Va.) said the police officers in Charlottesville were outgunned, as many white nationalist demonstrators had come to the rally clad in militia uniforms and wielding semiautomatic weapons.
Xinis, who worked for the law firm that represented the family of Freddie Gray in the litigation that followed his death while in police custody, said there was not enough evidence in the district court case against the protesters to justify denying their right to assemble.
Mckesson questioned the need for such evidence given the preponderance of lynchings and hate crimes that white supremacists in the Ku Klux Klan have committed “not a generation ago.” Lynching as an act of racially motivated extrajudicial killing was recorded in the United States well into the 1960s.
“This isn’t a philosophical debate. … This isn’t like a classroom conversation on gay marriage or not,” Mckesson said. “These ideas directly led to real harm to entire segments of the country and to not take that into account is to do an incomplete analysis.”
Xinis also referenced the 1977 National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie Supreme Court case, in which the court held that Nazi protesters were allowed to march wearing swastikas through Skokie, Ill., a town where many Holocaust survivors resided.
Spitzer added that the prevalence of certain ideologies is sometimes blown out of proportion, estimating that there might be no more than 150 Nazis in the country today. In the Skokie case, for example, the march never took place, and demonstrators decided to congregate in a nearby square instead.
When it comes to arguing about potential limits on free speech, Xinis said it is important not to paint every case with a broad brush.
“It’s in the court system that we respectfully have to get away from generalities and leads and talk about facts,” Xinis said.
Longo argued that the conversation on expression protections must not just focus on the federal government.
“The law gets made on the side of the road at 3 o’clock in the morning by a 23-year-old cop who’s got to make a decision,” Longo said. “These cops are now going to have to make a legal conclusion, and they’re not nearly skilled as some of us on this stage to be able to do that, to really understand what it is to incite.”
Ungar, a veteran journalist, wrote in an email to The Hoya that he appreciated the “original and thoughtful analysis” the speakers offered.
“It would have been much less valuable and successful, in my opinion, if everyone had just sat there and agreed with each other,” Ungar wrote. “Campus communities have a particular opportunity and obligation to weigh free speech dilemmas — and to figure out ways to keep the First Amendment alive and well, while also advancing inclusivity.”
The talk was sponsored by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, which provided a grant to the Free Speech Project for its founding this fall, and the Georgetown University Lecture Fund.
The event concluded with a discussion of the First Amendment’s role in social justice activism. Spitzer said  the activism that led to the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act — a federal law that defined marriage as the union of one man and one woman — and marriage equality for LGBTQ couples was caused by people who disagreed with the status quo.
Mckesson contended that despite this, the exchange of ideas should not always be unrestrained.
“There’s no reason why the marketplace of ideas doesn’t have some sort of regulation, so when we think about the First Amendment, it’s not a carte blanche,” Mckesson said. “We all have a role to play to make sure that we don’t let people negotiate history.”

The Washington, D.C. chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America has grown to a current membership of around 1,000 members from 200 last October.
The membership surge can be attributed to the strong showing by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary as well as President Donald Trump’s ultimate victory, according to Jacquelyn Smith, a member of the DSA’s steering committee.
“For DSA overall, the Sanders campaign was huge. He helped a lot of people distinguish themselves from liberals and it’s a lot more socially acceptable to identify as a socialist now,” Smith wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Trump’s election was a pretty radicalizing event and shook a lot of people into action (like me).”
According to the chapter’s website, the organization “advocate[s] for a radical restructuring of our economic and political systems to value people over profits.” The group’s mission includes empowering “workers, people of color, women, the LGBTQ community and other marginalized Americans.”
There are more than 30,000 DSA members nationwide. The D.C. chapter of the DSA is one of 130 current chapters, including Georgetown’s Young DSA chapter.
Some of the new recruits of D.C.’s DSA found the chapter through social media platforms or by attending local meetings. The group also reaches out to the community by hosting social events such as monthly happy hours and “Grrl’s Night,” an event catered toward women, femme and nonbinary members.
The chapter held its first local convention Oct. 21. According to Smith, the chapter’s bylaws had not been updated since 2011 when the landscape of the organization looked very different. The convention allowed the general body membership, the highest authority responsible for democratic decision-making within the organization, to gather and vote on the operations and priorities of the chapter.
The group of around 100 members passed several measures including a grievance procedure and anti-harassment policy, enumerated rights for caucuses and a permanent administrative committee focused on sustaining the chapter in the future and a resolution to discourage “tone policing” — criticizing someone else’s heated tone in a debate or conversation.
Like most chapters, the D.C. DSA’s primary focus is supporting political campaigns, including that of Lee Carter, a Democratic candidate for the Virginia House of Delegates in the 50th District, whose campaign is not receiving support from the state Democratic party. The D.C. DSA, however, has been sending dozens of volunteers to canvass in Manassas, Va., every weekend.
Carter said that the work of the D.C. DSA has had positive political and social influences on his campaign.
“They’ve been tremendously helpful in my fight to bring a message of inclusion down the Richmond,” Carter said in an interview with The Hoya.
Beyond its contributions to Carter’s campaign, the D.C. DSA is currently working with Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, the most localized levels of government in the city, and D.C. ReInvest to push the D.C. Council to cancel its contract with Wells Fargo to manage the city’s public money. The chapter also participates in mutual aid projects such as cooking for the homeless and offering free brake light repairs.
Founded in early February of this year by Andrew Adams (NHS ’20) and Jordan Brown (COL ’20), the Georgetown YDSA received about 100 student signups for its email list this semester.
The chapter plans to begin collecting petition signatures for an affordability campaign, the goals of which are greater socio-economic diversity on campus and tuition affordability, allowing students to graduate without debt.
Adams said the chapter is also looking to become more involved with the local D.C. chapter. On Nov. 25, some members plan to join the D.C. chapter in campaigning for Carter in Virginia.
“In the future, I hope that our chapter will get to participate in some of the anti-eviction training and canvassing that the DC chapter does,” Adams wrote in an email to The Hoya.
