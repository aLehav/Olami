Hundreds of students marched out of class Wednesday morning to call for gun violence prevention, part of a nationwide network of protests in the aftermath of last month’s mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla.
At least 200 Georgetown University students, members of faculty and local families gathered around Healy Circle for the student-organized walkout, which marked one month since a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 people, many of them students, and injured 17 more. The walkout was scheduled to last 17 minutes to commemorate each person killed in the shooting.
University President John J. DeGioia joined students at the protest, telling crowds that “no student should live in fear of gun violence.”
“Our first consideration must be to care for each other,” DeGioia said at the event.“There is a conviction that we share as members of this community: a belief that there is a good we can achieve together. There is a moment that demands good in us.”
Students speaking at the walkout called for gun control measures to prevent future tragedies and encouraged participants to vote out legislators who refuse to pass gun control measures. Gun control advocate Sarah Clements (COL ’18) said Georgetown’s show of solidarity was just a small part of a nationwide groundswell for gun control reforms in the aftermath of the Parkland shooting.
“Thousands and thousands of schools are participating in this event around the country,” Clements said. “We are demanding change from our leaders and politicians.”
In addition to speeches by DeGioia and students, the walkout included three minutes of silence and a reading of the names of young people affected by gun violence in Washington, D.C. After the event concluded, some students went downtown to join protests already in progress at the White House and the Capitol Building.

This is a developing story. This post will be updated as more information becomes available.

Amazon Books’ first Washington, D.C. location opened Tuesday on M Street, offering two stories of the online retail giant’s brick-and-mortar bookstore concept.
The M Street location is the 15th of its kind in the country and modifies Amazon’s online model for the physical store. Using Goodreads reviews, Amazon ratings, Kindle data and other virtually aggregated information, the store stocks nearly 5,600 “highly curated” titles.
“Our stores kind of reflect the tastes, passions and interests of millions of customers,” said Mariana Garavaglia, head of stores and retail operations for Amazon Books, in an interview with The Hoya. “Every store has especially locally curated features that are specific to that store.”
The store focuses on “discovery,” with sections like “If You Like…,” which features popular books alongside lesser-known titles with similar themes, and “Page Turners,” a selection of books that a majority of Kindle readers finished in three days or less. Every book in the store is rated four stars or above on Amazon.com; the average rating of the books in the Georgetown store is 4½ stars.
Amazon Books’ signature feature is that all books in the store face outwards, making it easier than ever to judge a book by its cover.
“We wanted to have that discoverability element of each book facing out and communicating its own essence,” Garavaglia said.
Though every book is displayed with a review card, there are no prices listed with books. Rather, customers can check inside a book cover for the list price, scan the book with an in-store price checker or use the Amazon app to see the Amazon Prime price. Amazon Prime uses a shifting price system, necessitating the lack of a price listing in Amazon Books.
An Amazon Prime membership, which gives customers two-day delivery and access to certain discounts, allows Amazon Books shoppers to save what they would on books online.
“The prices on Amazon.com can fluctuate a bit,” Garavaglia said. “We want to make sure that we’re always giving customers the same great price that they can get online.”
The store is also cashless: Customers can use the Amazon app to pay from their phone. However, shoppers must still check out at the register if they use the app option.
Georgetown’s 10,000-square-foot store is one of the largest Amazon Books storefronts to date. The location devotes several tables to Amazon devices like Echo and Alexa, complete with seating for customers to sit and test the devices.
“For a lot of customers, this is the first time that they’re interacting with Alexa,” Garavaglia said.
The bottom floor of the store includes a children’s section with a small play area, which features activities and Kindles for children. A distinct section in the Georgetown store is the Amazon Launchpad, which highlights games and gadgets by the “brightest startups.” The store also has D.C.-centric offerings, like D.C. Books for Kids.
The store also includes an Allegro Coffee cafe; Allegro is owned by Whole Foods, which Amazon purchased in August 2017. The cafe serves pastries from The Sweet Lobby, a local vendor, and stocks snacks from Union Kitchen startups like Snacklins.
Although the Amazon Books is about halfway between Georgetown University and The George Washington University’s Foggy Bottom campus, the store does not offer textbooks. It does, however, stock education-related materials, such as the books found in its “Learning a New Language” section.
Although Amazon Books may not cater specifically to nearby college students, the university population is one reason for the location on M Street, in addition to heavy foot traffic in the commercial area.
Garavaglia cited Amazon’s history as a bookseller as the foundation for the company’s progression into brick-and-mortar retail. Amazon was founded in 1994 as an online bookstore. While it has expanded into nearly every form of retail since, Amazon Books is in line with that original mission.
“Books are in our DNA,” Garavaglia said. “We want to ensure that customers have the option to read however they like, in whatever format they like.”

I will not be visiting this store until Amazon cuts its ties with the NRA.

Georgetown University is set to create a new task force for gender equity this semester, University President John J. DeGioia announced March 1.
The announcement of the task force coincides with the start of Women’s History Month. It also comes as universities and corporations across the country begin to examine how their internal structures promote or inhibit gender equity in light of the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements, which advocate for gender equality and environments free from sexual harassment and assault.
Jane Aiken, vice dean and professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center, has been selected to lead the task force, but the other members who will work with her have yet to be selected.
“I’m working closely with President DeGioia to assemble a diverse team of faculty from different disciplines with expertise that would be helpful to this work. Georgetown is a large and diverse place, and tapping into the broad expertise we have here is both a challenge and an exciting opportunity,” Aiken said.
Aiken served on a similar task force at the University of South Carolina in the past and chaired the Governor’s Task Force on AIDS for the state of Arizona.
Ensuring that the task force reflects the university’s current and continued movement toward diversity on campus remains a priority for the university, according to Georgetown’s strategic communications director Rachel Pugh.
“Georgetown is deeply committed to gender equity and ensuring that our faculty and senior administrators reflect the changing demographics of our society,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The task force will be fully operational within the next few weeks, according to Pugh, and it will work throughout the school year to make recommendations for the university to improve gender equity among faculty and senior leadership.
The task force will be concerned with four main areas of work, according to DeGioia’s announcement. These areas include examining how Georgetown has successfully improved gender equity among faculty and senior leadership and how current institutional practices contribute to or detract from such equity.
Discussions about the possibility of a task force on gender equity began in fall 2017, continuing a recent chain of efforts from the university to enhance Georgetown’s commitment to gender equity. In 2011, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton launched the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security. In 2014, the university founded the Georgetown Women’s Alliance, and in 2016 the university announced a partnership with the United Nations campaign HeForShe, an international initiative that seeks to encourage men and boys to advocate for gender equity.
“We are committed to ensuring that Georgetown is a place where women thrive and are recognized for their contributions,” Pugh wrote.
Aiken echoed this sentiment, noting the ways gender equity is particularly important at a university.
“Promoting gender equity doesn’t just ensure better outcomes for women; it ensures better outcomes for the students we teach and the research we produce,” Aiken said.
Lauren Stricker (SFS ’18), president of Georgetown University Women in Leadership, said that GUWIL welcomes this step from the university toward achieving gender equity.
“GUWIL is thrilled that the Georgetown administration is taking gender inequity seriously and seeking meaningful, concrete change to improve the campus climate for people of all genders,” Stricker said.
Stricker also said she looks forward to the ways in which this task force may amplify previously unheard voices on campus.
“I am hopeful that this task force will better provide space for the voices of women and of persons across the gender spectrum in university leadership and decision-making, particularly as Georgetown has never had a non-male president,” Stricker said.
However, Stricker also mentioned ways the task force can change how the university currently operates.
“I hope that this initiative challenges Georgetown to support women throughout their professional lives, especially related to equal pay, mentorship and resources, protection from sexual harassment and assault and paid leave,” Stricker said, “I hope this task force will have a diverse membership that improves the status of gender equity in ways that the community genuinely wants and needs.”

Georgetown’s team of computer-savvy undergraduate and graduate students placed first in their category at the inaugural hackathon at the Vatican, VHacks, which took place in Rome on March 8 through 11.
The event consisted of a 36-hour period of coding to create and pitch a solution to a social problem posed by one of the three categories of the competition. The goal was to use technology to address issues related to the three themes, to promote cooperation among students of diverse backgrounds and to encourage “value-based institutions” like universities to use technology to further their missions.
Lucy Obus (COL ’11, GRD ’18), Rushika Shekhar (GRD ’18), Yanchen Wang (GRD ’19), Roisin McLoughlin (COL ’19) and Jake Glass (SFS ’20) were tasked with creating a solution under the category of “Migrants and Refugees.”
The team designed and created a web app that aims to help refugees in European countries secure leases. The team designed the app to combat the lack of affordable housing, which many refugees face in countries like Italy. Often, refugees have difficulty finding places to stay because they lack credit in their new country.
Glass said this kind of app would be especially helpful for individuals who have lower or nonexistent credit scores because of their refugee status, and are thus not seen as fiscally responsible.
“We’re specifically targeting those who can’t find a lease because they might not be seen as fiscally responsible enough by landlords,” Glass said. “We try to establish that credit history using an algorithm similar to that which banks use to create a credit score, except that score is based on sort of lower level transactions to prove financial responsibility and competency on the part of the refugees.”
Obus said he was inspired by an interaction with a refugee who was unable to find housing.
“We were pretty dumbfounded in the last conversations we had the night before the hackathon,” Obus said. “A roof over your head is everything.”
The Georgetown team’s participation was the culmination of a campuswide effort to send these students to Rome. Several on-campus institutes contributed to this effort, such as the Maker Hub, the Community, Culture and Technology Program, the Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation, and the Global Human Development Program.
Don Undeen, manager of the Maker Hub at Lauinger Library; Holly Wise, a visiting professor for the Global Human Development Program; and Ryan Gillis, the grants manager for the School of Foreign Service also travelled to the Vatican with the team.
Undeen acted as one of the 40 on-site mentors to support students as they created their projects. He is also a member of the Vatican Art and Technology Council, and said the event, though it was held in the Vatican, is relevant even for students who are not Catholic.
“Modern, western, technology-oriented culture is really connecting with Pope Francis’ message of tenderness, environmental stewardship, and welcoming people, taking a skeptical look at some aspects of capitalism, human values,” Undeen said. “Those types of folks are looking at the Vatican and saying, ‘even if we don’t share your faith, we agree with a lot of the stuff you’re saying.’”
Undeen also said the university resources provided to the students allowed them to leave the experience with significant takeaways.
“We got the students lots of opportunities to meet with refugee communities and meet with people who work on the ground with refugee communities,” Undeen said. “So they understand when designing something that it’s not just a pie in the sky, but you’ve got real people in real situations that are going to be affected by this.”
Obus agreed that the assistance from the university also gave the team enough freedom to design their app.
“We were really lucky to have the support system from Georgetown,” Obus said. “They offered us support, and they also let us do our own work. I think it was a phenomenal testament to the way that Georgetown is committed to empowering their students and trusting their students to get it done.”
Undeen hopes the team’s success will generate interest from the Georgetown community in more events like this one, including Make48, a “makeathon” in which participants have 48 hours to create a marketable product, which is set to take place in August.
“We so far have 100 percent win ratings,” Undeen said.
