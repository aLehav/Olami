Even as the Metropolitan Police Department denies it is unfairly cracking down on off-campus nightlife, students affected by a harsher D.C. noise law have ramped up opposition to the measure, which went into effect last week.
MPD has made calls to Burleith resident Jenny Devine’s (COL ’11) home three times over the past three Fridays. During each visit, there have been four to five people in her house, but there has been no sign of alcohol or partying.
Last Friday, her neighbors called the police after Devine and her friends had ordered pizza at 2 a.m. The policeman explained that the next time he was called to her house, he would have to arrest someone.
“I really don’t think you’re going to see anyone else [other than students] being arrested. It’s not that I’m angry,” Devine said. “I’m just frustrated we can’t have an adult conversation.”
According to Gwendolyn Crump, acting director of MPD communications, however, college students are not the only ones targeted for noise violations.
“I can tell you that noise complaints are an issue in neighborhoods throughout the District that are not near a university,” Crump said.
But individual students and the Georgetown University Student Association do not believe MPD and the D.C. Council, which passed the law, is acting entirely in good faith.
In a bill passed Sunday, GUSA condemned the ordinance for its severe punishments — up to 90 days in jail and a $500 fine — and suggested that it was meant to target D.C. college students.
The GUSA Senate intends to send a letter to the D.C. Council and the MPD; a draft of the message will be made public by this weekend.
GUSA Senate speaker Adam Mortillaro (COL ’12) has been in touch with the student body presidents of American University, Catholic University and Howard University so they can coordinate efforts against the ordinance. The schools’ executives, including University President John J. DeGioia, plan to meet next week in order to draft a joint letter to the D.C. Council and MPD.
Mortillaro met with several university officials on Tuesday, including Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, Associate Vice President for Student Affairs Jeanne Lord, Director of Student Affairs Anne Koester and Director of Student Programs Erika Cohen-Derr. According to Mortillaro, the administrators were receptive to GUSA’s concerns.
“We’re all waiting to see what this weekend and the upcoming few weeks mean in terms of implementation, but GUSA has taken the appropriate steps to immediately bring the matter to court should things go south,” Mortillaro said.
University spokesperson Julie Bataille said that the administration understands students’ take on the amendment and is working to ensure that MPD upholds the interests of both students and neighbors.
“My understanding is that this is to be implemented city-wide and was not intended to specifically target students. University officials will continue to work cooperatively with MPD on issues related to the safety of our students and the fair enforcement of this law in particular,” Bataille said in an email.
GUSA plans on having a town hall meeting in the near future in order to gather more student input.
Students from other D.C. schools face similar problems, saying that the amendment discriminates against college students.
“[The noise ordinance] is just ridiculously vague and will impact students more than anyone else,” said Joe Pacheco, a sophomore at the George Washington University, said. “Why does the city favor one group of people over another, especially one that constitutes a large proportion of the population, pumps ridiculous amounts of money into the city’s economy and in a lot of cases constitutes a large contingent of the city’s highly educated workforce? It’s thinly veiled ageism.”
For Devine, whose home has been visited by MPD recently, neighborhood antagonism seems to play a role. Though complaints and animosity from the neighbors began last semester, Devine says that neighbors have practically refused to speak with her and her roommates.
Devine believes that part of the conflict stems from the local movement against the university’s 2010 Campus Plan, which will go before the D.C. Zoning Commission in April. Recently, the Citizens Association of Georgetown instructed residents to call MPD instead of the Student Neighborhood Assistance Program, a university-run off-campus monitoring service.
“People are caught up in the heat of the moment with everything that’s going on,” Devine said.

The GUSA presidential campaign kicked off at midnight Thursday, beginning a five-way race lasting two weeks.
On Feb. 24, the student body will have 24 hours to vote for the next Georgetown University Student Association president and vice president, following a campaign period that will include a debate among presidential candidates.
The following pairs submitted their candidacy this weekend for the respective positions of president and vice president: Ace Factor (COL ’12) and James Pickens (COL ’12); Jed Feiman (COL ’12) and Henry Sims (COL ’12); Charlie Joyce (COL ’12) and Paige Lovejoy (SFS ’12); Kristie Kalenka (MSB ’12) and Jared Coppotelli (MSB ’12); and Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) and Greg Laverriere (COL ’12).
In a statement to The Hoya, Factor, a former GUSA senator, said he and Pickens’ aims were threefold: to create a student advocacy office to inform students of their rights; to boost community service efforts among students and Jesuits; and to increase GUSA’s transparency.
“We hope by campaigning and pushing these issues to bring GUSA back to its intended purpose: to represent student interests here on the Hilltop,” Factor said.
Feiman, who is vice president of the College Academic Council, is running with Sims, the center on the men’s basketball team. Feiman said his ticket hopes to bring a unique perspective to the table.
“Henry and I are two student leaders from very different areas in the Georgetown community, and we’ve come together to unite the campus,” Feiman said. “Our opponents remind us … of the same GUSA candidates year after year, and we think we offer something new.”
Citing his experience in GUSA, Joyce, a current member of the GUSA executive cabinet, said he would work to cut down on red tape and enhance student life.
“My time in GUSA has given me a thorough understanding of relationships between students, the administration, and the community,” Joyce said. “Over time, I have realized that there are many areas where policy and processes at Georgetown should be streamlined. I will help make student life at Georgetown easier, so that students can focus on their academic and extra-curricular endeavors without distraction.”
Kalenka and Coppotelli, both former high school class presidents, said safety and space would be the central issues of their campaign.
“We want to further improve what GUSA has already done. We would like to improve campus safety, and find the best way to utilize all the buildings on campus to maximize student group space,” Kalenka said.
Meaney, who is GUSA’s deputy chief of staff, said he looked to capitalize on his experience in the GUSA executive staff combined with Laverriere’s time in the senate; Laverriere is the current chair of the Finance and Appropriations Committee.
“Georgetown students need representatives who think creatively and will work hard to implement solutions to fix the many issues facing students,” Meaney said. “Through my experience with the executive and Greg’s in the senate, as well as our involvement outside of GUSA, we have a proving record of making innovative ideas become reality. We want to take these skills to the next level so we can continuing serving our fellow students.”
Director of Student Programs Erika Cohen-Derr attended the two informational sessions held this weekend for candidates and spoke to the novelty of this particular race, which will elect the successors to Calen Angert (MSB ’11) and Jason Kluger (MSB ’11); the two have been at the helm of GUSA for two years.
“I am looking forward to the chance for another generation of students to continue the work of thoughtful advocacy that Calen and Jason have focused on for the last two years,” Cohen-Derr said. “GUSA provides a very important mechanism to involve students in the governance of the university — the campaign season is a perfect opportunity for the student body to learn how each set of prospective executive teams would best represent their interests and prioritize their needs.”
This campaign season, candidates are required to present a prospective budget for their year in office. The budget would include the expenses for GUSA Senate, the executive committee and any programs the candidates propose.
Campaigners are limited to a $300 budget and 150 fliers that can be posted in public spaces at any given time. The commission said that candidates may campaign door to door and residents can agree to post fliers on their own doors. According to Election Commissioner Adam Giansiracusa (SFS ’12), candidates may also post in residence halls under separate policies. At press time, two of the campaigning pairs — Joyce-Lovejoy and Meaney-Laverriere — had launched websites outlining their platforms.
Kluger declared his support for Meaney and Lavierierre this morning, citing their experience and detailed platform.
“[Calen and I] both officially support Mike and Greg. By far they are the most experienced candidates. …We’re both on board for them.”
Angert, the outgoing president, said he was excited to see the election process begin.
“Jason and I have had a great run, but now it’s time for someone else to take the reins,” Angert said. “It’s bittersweet — I’ve enjoyed my time, but I’m ready to have more of my own time to pursue other interests.”

The message on D.C.’s license plates may soon come to pass. Instead of giving the District a voting seat in the House of Representatives, which it has sought for decades, residents would be exempt from federal taxes.
Rep. Allen West’s (R-Fla.) proposal would end the “taxation without representation” complaint and likely stimulate the District’s economy, according to the DCist.
Leah Ramsay, communications manager of DC Vote, an advocacy group that works to secure full representation for the District, supports the motivation behind West’s movement, but ultimately believes that D.C.’s autonomy should take priority.
“It’s great to see someone in Congress interested in D.C.’s plight,” she said. “However, we want the full rights we’ve been paying for with our taxes for 200 years. We don’t want a consolation.”
West’s recommendation comes following Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton’s newest proposal, which would allow the District to pass local civil and criminal legislation without congressional review.
The bill, titled the District of Columbia Legislative Autonomy Act of 2011, is the fifth in her Free and Equal D.C. series. The first four bills call for statehood for the District of Columbia, representation in the House and Senate and the ability to enact the city’s budget without congressional approval.
Under current law, D.C. has no voting representatives in Congress and all legislation is subject to congressional review. This can slow down the local lawmaking process, as review of the city’s legislative proposals can only occur when congress is in session. Rather than completely voiding congressional review, the bill would make it optional. Norton is hoping that removing unnecessary review will save money and time for both the federal government and the District.
The bill comes amid growing tension between District officials and Republicans in the House, who proposed legislation that would ban the use of District tax dollars for funding abortions last week. Advocates for the District’s political autonomy such as DC Vote are expecting more political battles ahead.
“These are hot-button issues that congressmen will use to gain support from constituents back home — but they aren’t imposing them at home, only on the District,” Ramsay said.
Although it is unlikely that they will pass, Norton’s bills have taken on symbolic value for the District’s quest for full representation.
“We must not cease pressing for budget autonomy until we get it.” Norton said in a press release. “Allowing the city to spend its own funds, which residents raise through their own local taxes, is second only to achieving full voting rights. No principle is more essential to the right of self-government, the oldest American principle.”

About 500 campuses in the United States are now smoke-free, but Georgetown does not look to be joining their ranks in the near future.
Yale University plans to survey faculty and students this month about their support for the ban, according to The Yale Daily News, leading the debate among peer universities about the possibility of tightening their smoking policies.
Georgetown is not a smoke-free campus and has no plans to instate a ban, according to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh.
“At Georgetown, we are committed to maintaining an environment that is reasonably free from tobacco smoke,” Pugh said. “While there are no current plans to change this policy on the main campus, we are continuing to explore new ways of promoting a culture of wellness at Georgetown.”
While Georgetown has yet to take further action regarding its current smoking policies, some faculty would like to see the university follow its peer institutions into stricter regulations.
“Smoke-free environments will be a reality soon. Starting this on college campuses, where minds are being formed, makes sense to me,” biology professor Maria Donoghue said.
Though Georgetown is not a smoke-free campus, the university does have smoking restrictions in order to promote the health and safety of students, faculty and staff, Pugh said. These include a prohibition on smoking in all indoor locations on campus, which has been in place since the 1980s. The university allows smoking only in designated areas that are at least 25 feet from building entrances, outdoor air intakes and windows, according to Pugh.
There is a fear that the bans would infringe upon individual liberties, according to The Daily Pennsylvanian, but government professor Richard Boyd said that a university ban on smoking would not infringe upon the rights of students and employees.
“The university is no different from any other place of business — say, an office, restaurant, or hotel. Like any other private association, the university is free to establish terms of usage or conduct on their property or within their workplace,” Boyd said. “If patrons or employees don’t like these terms of service or policies, the assumption is that they are free to eat, stay or work elsewhere.”
Government professor Stephen Wayne agreed that Georgetown would be entitled to impose such a smoking ban.
“The university can impose rules on the grounds that aren’t necessarily applicable to everyone in the District,” he said. “A ban does limit autonomy, but in a way, given what we know scientifically about smoke, that is beneficial for society.”
According to a 2006 American Lung Association report, almost 20 percent of college students were smokers at the time. At that time, the organization urged colleges to ban smoking on campuses.
If a ban were to be implemented, however, it could potentially deter students from coming to the university. Wayne said that it could have a greater impact on the enrollment decisions of international students, given the greater recreational uses of cigarettes in other cultures and societies.

For a school graced by imposing architecture and a scenic setting, finding art can be surprisingly difficult.
But even as students and faculty lament that the department of art and art history gets little recognition from a community preoccupied with politics and business, the campus art scene has carved out its own niche.
For now, the department occupies the first two floors of the Edmund A. Walsh Building, located a block away from the front gates.
“If you ask the question of whether we have adequate facilities for students of the arts, the answer is we don’t,” Department Chair John Morrell said. “If we compare ourselves to other schools we have half the faculty and half the space that other institutions offer.”
Though the Walsh Building was slated to be renovated as a new visual arts center in the 2000 Campus Plan, the university was unable to raise the funds and the project was tabled, according to Morrell. Instead, the art department was left with limited space, which restricts the number of classes
that can be offered and ultimately slows program growth.
“It would be nice to have a more visible space,” visiting assistant professor of studio art Evan Reed said. “We’re tucked back in a corner, sometimes people don’t even know what’s there.”
Reed, the gallery director for the art and art history departments, organizes the displays of student artwork around campus. Currently, student contributions are displayed in a gallery in the Walsh Building, in Lauinger Library’s Gelardin New Media Center and in the College Dean’s office in the Intercultural Center. LCD screens in those locations also display a rotating selection of student work.
The exhibits, which are switched out biannually, include drawings, paintings, digital art, sculpture and photography. Most of the work is gleaned from the university’s basic art courses, and the pieces themselves reflect the central themes of the curricula, according to Hubert Cloke, senior associate dean of the college.
Cloke hopes that the presence of student art in the dean’s office entryway will encourage students to explore the studio art programs that Georgetown offers.
“Part of the logic of doing this is that I want students to think of art as something that you do here,” he said. “It’s not just an extracurricular.”
But both artists and their professors agree that the display spaces currently provided at Georgetown are inadequate, hindering the growth of the art program.
“What we really need is a much larger gallery space, at least six times the size of what we have now,” Morrell said. “It’s an important part of [students’] experience of learning to create art, being able to display their creations.”
Ian Schlesinger (COL ’12), who has taken several photography classes, agrees.
“I don’t really consider [the Walsh gallery] a gallery,” Schlesinger wrote in an email. “I figured it was just there, right outside the classroom, to give the students the illusion that people cared.”
Faced with cramped space options, students and professors say Georgetown’s setbacks are an unfortunate reality they are forced to cope with.
“We need to get up to the level of other schools in terms of art. It’s not the fault of the professors or anything, that’s just the way it is,” art minor Tae Jung Choi (COL ’11) said. “Right now, [Georgetown] is just not an art school. … I feel like most people don’t really take the art department seriously.”
In order to combat that sort of apathy toward the arts, Mariel Reed (SFS ’10) founded the Georgetown University Art Aficionados in 2007 with the intention of cultivating an appreciation for art. The club was recognized by the Student Activities Committee in the same year.
“It was sort of a fledgling organization then,” GUAA member Montana Mathieu (SFS ’10) said. “They had been battling the school on a lot of administrative grounds.”
GUAA has been working to develop a better appreciation for the arts through trips to museums off campus. The group is holding on-campus workshops and three large exhibits this year in an attempt to foster more of a Hilltop-centric art scene. Last year’s GTown at G40 event, part of a month-long art and music exhibition, drew 900 attendants, according to Alexandra Crane (COL ’12), GUAA’s current president and an art history major.
Crane and Mathieu lamented the lack of funding that both the club and Georgetown’s art departments receive, as the club received $400 from SAC for this academic year. The SAC funding guidelines for 2011 allocate $490 for each student arts performance and $370 for events that feature partnerships with professionals.
Despite all the complaints plaguing the art department’s funding, students offer almost unanimous praise for the program itself.
The department currently offers between 25 to 30 studio art classes enrolling 350 to 400 students, according to Morrell. Each graduating class has 10 to 20 studio art and 60 art history majors.
“The department may be a bit overlooked, unglamorously shunned to a floor of the Walsh Building, but it has a very devoted following, and if anyone is at all interested in art, they know about it,” Schlesinger said.
Highlighting the program’s professors, Choi, who has taken six studio art classes at Georgetown, has been impressed with the quality of instruction, .
“Art professors are better at motivating you than other classes. They let you try out a lot of different things on your own. They’ll teach you something and let you play with it,” Choi said. “They’re showing you the tools and then you go out and do what you want.”
Mathieu also lauded the incorporation of the visual arts in other academic fields, specifically in the languages. She hopes that they can be worked further into other student groups at Georgetown.
“It’s hard for Georgetown students to not come across the arts as a major part of contemporary culture,” she said.
However, Crane feels that the visual arts are perceived as a hobby instead of a viable life choice at Georgetown. A career-focused mentality among students leads them to neglect the arts, Crane said.
“Those that are interested in the arts are kind of discouraged,” she said.
Introduction to Design student Keelin O’Donoghue (COL ’13) also felt the pull toward vocational studies over more artistic endeavors. O’Donoghue originally elected to take an art class because the arts have had a large influence in her family, and she felt the experience would be a relaxing addition to her schedule.
“It’s always been forced on me, and then when it wasn’t, I missed it,” she said.
“I was taking it under the impression it would be calming,” she said. “I’ve ended up spending an incredible amount of time on my work.”
According to Choi, O’Donoghue’s experience is not uncommon. A number of students underestimate the amount of effort involved in art classes, he explained, and they assume that classes will be easier than their regular course load.
“A lot of the students that actually go into the art classes, they’re taking it as something extra, just to try out, and a lot of times they’re surprised by how much work there actually is,” he said. “There are a lot of things that people don’t know about what art students do.”
Art classes require students to invest a lot of creativity into their work, and GUAA hopes to tap into this emphasis to stress the importance of art in all career choices.
“It is a part of everyone,” Mathieu said. “To kind of stretch those muscles is really important.”
Crane believes that the presence of the visual arts on campus have the potential to grow.
“The art scene is burgeoning, but I hope it really comes into its own,” she said.
Reed shares this hope.
“Art is another way of learning about culture. It’s a way of learning visually, becoming literate visually,” Reed said.
“We don’t put a whole lot of emphasis on looking at visual images and learning to decode them, and most of our ways of dealing with the world are visual, whether its computers or advertising,” Reed said. “Having a department that teaches students how to do that, what art means and how it works, is important.”

The 2011 Recyclemania competition, which kicked off last Sunday, pits 630 colleges and universities against each other in a competition to see who can recycle the most.
William Del Vecchio, manager of solid waste and recycling at the university, is optimistic that Georgetown will fare well in it’s fifth go-round at the program.
“Georgetown has a top-rated recycling program — we always do well.  So far, we’ve always been in the top 25 percent,” he said.
Georgetown’s recycling rates are relatively high compared to area schools like The George Washington University and Howard University. The university boasts a recycling rate of 47.55 percent of the 2220 tons of waste generated since July of last year.
“I can basically tell you that there are no schools in the area that come close to our rates of recycling,” Del Vecchio said. “We’ve consistently come in the top 50 across the board and higher in some categories of the [Recyclemania] competition.”
Although Georgetown has consistently ranked in the top third of the competition, Del Vecchio says that there is still room for improvement. This year, Georgetown has decided to focus on two aspects of the competition: overall recycling rates and waste minimization.
“To maximize the environmental benefit, it’s best to first reduce or limit consumption of resources,” Audrey Stewart, the program coordinator for sustainability at Georgetown, said. “Recycling is listed third in the phrase, ‘reduce, reuse, recycle’ for a reason — while better than throwing items away, it still consumes energy, and many materials cannot be truly recycled.”
The facilities, Residential Life and sustainability offices have teamed up with EcoAction, a student-run environmental group, among others, to promote the competition and increase student involvement.
Just in time for the competition, the facilities department has distributed individual recycling bins in Harbin and Darnall Halls as part of a pilot program to increase recycling rates in residence halls. According to Del Vecchio, residence halls are the biggest areas in which recycling is neglected.
“All faculty and staff have [the individual recycling bins], but this is the first time we’re putting them in residence halls,” Del Vecchio said.  “We’ve planned this since two years ago to introduce them in the dorms. We’ll see if it affects Recyclemania.”
EcoAction also has several activities planned to promote student awareness.
“Throughout Recyclemania, EcoAction will do recycling raids, where we go through the trash cans across campus and take out the recyclable materials,” Seungah Lee (SFS ’12), co-president of EcoAction, said. “We usually create some sort of art with the recyclable materials we found during the raid and display it on campus to show what is not being recycled.”
Posters with statistics and guidelines for easy recycling will also be posted around campus, and the sustainability office’s website offers information on the competition.
Recyclemania, an eight-week-long recycling competition first started in 2001, has grown rapidly. The Recyclemania tournament ends April 2.

Turns out Georgetown graduates not only get into Congress, they stay there. Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) has served 29 terms in Congress since he arrived in 1955, and he declared last month that he plans to run for a 30th term as well.
As the longest-serving representative currently in Congress, Dingell had plenty of experience to speak from in his visit Tuesday to the newly renovated Public Policy Institute.
The event, which was moderated by Dean of Public Policy Edward Montgomery, provided an open forum for audience members to ask Dingell questions ranging from his political stances to his experience in the House of Representatives.
In his introduction, Montgomery praised Dingell for his steadfast service to the country, which includes two years of Army service during World War II. “He has had a very distinguished legislative career after living in what John Brokaw called ‘The Greatest Generation,'” Montgomery said.
Dingell spoke about his time in the Army as well as the years that followed, touching on his work as a park ranger, a prosecutor and a researcher before following his father — another congressional representative — into politics. He then turned his attention to pressing policy issues.
Dingell addressed the polarization of the political spectrum, advocating for more dialogue between congressional colleagues. He said that the introduction of C-SPAN and the broadcast of congressional meetings had interrupted a tradition of interaction.
“When you watch my colleagues on the floor or in committee, you will see them looking at the camera, which is in the gallery, rather than looking at their colleagues,” he said. “That’s a bad thing. I’ve seen the day, and I’m very proud of it, when members were able to talk.”
Still, Dingell refused to say that bipartisanship is an idea of the past. Rather, he said, representatives are still working together across the political divide, and he anticipates that bipartisan legislation will become increasingly more important going forward.
“[Bipartisanship] was never dead, it’s not now dead and it will have to come back when the need is there,” he said.
Dingell did not shy away from addressing contentious issues including U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson’s January court decision that declared the individual mandate of last year’s health care reform unconstitutional. In response to a question regarding the decision, Dingell said that he believes Vinson’s verdict was out of line and poorly argued.
“First of all, bad decision, bad judge, bad interpretation of the law, bad consequences, and I don’t think it is going to be sustained,” he said.
Despite the difficulties facing this Congress, Dingell emphasized that he is optimistic about the outlook for this round of debate and legislation, though he remains cautious after last year’s laborious political battles.
“The Congress has, I hope, great promise,” he said.

Speaking to a packed audience of future politicos, journalists and business-minded students, famed investigative reporter Bob Woodward highlighted the importance of constantly seeking the truth, the hallmark of his four-decade career.
“Democracies die in darkness,” Woodward said to a full audience in the Intercultural Center at the Mike Jurist Memorial Lecture, which commemorates Jurist (SFS ’07), a previous president of Lecture Fund who passed away shortly after graduating. Past speakers for the Jurist Lectures include veteran ABC news journalist George Stephanopoulos and Bush advisor Karl Rove.
An icon in investigative journalism, Woodward is best known for his work in exposing the Watergate Scandal. He emphasized the importance of open government and the pursuit of the truth, peppering his talk with anecdotes reflecting his intimate understanding of the eight presidents that he has covered.
“What will do us in is secret government, and that’s what Nixon tried,” he said.
“You see what is going on in Egypt,” Woodward added. “That is a rebellion against secret government.”
Woodward’s reporting on Watergate with fellow Washington Post reporter Carl Bernstein is often hailed as one of the greatest displays of investigative journalism. The two wrote a bestselling book, “All The President’s Men,” on their experience which was made into an Oscar-winning film of the same name.
Woodward has since penned 16 books including twelve No. 1 best sellers. He continues to work for The Washington Post as an associate editor, and his most recent book, “Obama’s Wars,” was published last September.
“I almost called [‘Obama’s Wars’] ‘The Divided Man,’ because [Obama] knows he has to lead, he signed up for this, he’s commander-in-chief, but at the same time he just does not like war,” Woodward said.
Woodward’s quest for exposing the truth has been a driving force behind his career, he said, but he knows that there are more secrets to uncover. Recalling a discussion he once had with Al Gore, Woodward said that Gore told him that the public knows only one percent of what went on during Clinton’s eight years in the oval office.
“I just died,” Woodward recalled. “It’s certainly something I live with every day … Do we really know what’s happening?”
At one point, Woodward asked audience members to name their biggest political fears, with answers ranging from climate change to political polarization.
“All of the things you’ve raised, and the other issues on the agendas, are real, but I think we’ll deal with them eventually,” Woodward said. “My answer on what to worry about is secret government.”

Former Georgetown student Charles Smith and former University of Richmond student John Perrone were convicted Friday for attempted and unlawful manufacture of the controlled substance Dimethyltryptamine, a D.C. code violation. They will be placed on probation for three years.
Smith and Perrone were arrested on Oct. 23 on suspicion of producing one gram of DMT in Smith’s Harbin dorm room, enough for roughly 10 doses, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.
Perrone had printed instructions off the Internet and purchased the materials necessary to produce DMT, including ammonia, acetone and paint thinner. Smith had agreed to pay for half of the materials, he said at Friday’s hearing at the U.S. District Court. The DMT was produced for personal use, not for sale and distribution.
“It was for personal use,” Perrone said. “I might have shared it with others, but that was not the plan. The plan was not to manufacture a bunch and sell it.”
Smith and Perrone decided to make DMT, as opposed to other drugs, because of the relative ease and low risk of producing it. It does not carry the same risk of explosion as methamphetamine, for example.
“The process itself is simple and less dangerous than many other things,” Smith said at the hearing.
Smith and Perrone used ammonia, acetone and paint thinner to extract the drug from a Mimosa root-bark. They then sealed the DMT in six mason jars, which they placed in a Styrofoam cooler filled with dry ice to allow the drug to crystallize, according to Perrone.
The Georgetown Department of Public Safety arrived while the DMT was in the process of crystallizing and immediately took Smith and Perrone into custody.
“I have never consumed DMT in my life. Didn’t get that far,” Perrone said.
At a hearing at the U.S. District Court on Oct. 28 following the arrest, Smith and Perrone were released to the custody of their parents in Andover, Mass. Their next court date was set for Jan. 24. That hearing was cancelled, however, as their lawyers and the prosecution reached a plea agreement.
On Friday, the two sides passed a joint, non-binding sentence recommendation for the defendants of six months in prison, with an execution of sentence suspended probation of three years after the defendants pled guilty.
With an ESS probation, the defendants will not serve their sentence in jail but will be put on probation for three years.
If they complete probation without any violations, the conviction will be expunged from their record; the arrest will remain, however. Violation of the terms of probation could result in them serving their original prison sentence. Pending input from the Probation Office, the sentence will be finalized with potential modifications within three weeks.
Until then, Smith and Perrone will continue living with their parents on release at their Massachusetts homes. Neither is currently enrolled in a university.

Georgetown’s tuition will spike by 2.9 percent next year, the university announced in a press release Friday, after the Board of Directors approved the increase.
The increase – which raises tuition from $39,768 to $40,920 for the 2011-12 academic year – nearly matches last year’s 3 percent tuition hike. Georgetown’s tuition has been rising steadily for years; the 2009-2010 increase of 2.9 percent, matching next year’s increase, was the smallest percentile increase since 1973.
Room and board charges will also be raised by 2 and 2.9 percent respectively. After totaling tuition, room and board charges, the total cost in 2011-2012 will amount to $53,910, up 2.8 percent from this year’s $52,443.
Despite the climb, Georgetown remains committed to accommodating students in need of financial aid, the press release said. The board of directors’ newest package increases financial aid by 10 percent.
“Providing aid to eligible undergraduates with financial need is a top university priority,” Provost James O’Donnell said in the press release. About 55 percent of students receive financial aid. The university pledged to retain a need-blind admissions policy and meet the full financial need of its undergraduate students, even as federal financial aid programs potentially face massive cuts.
The limited tuition increase is reflective of the university’s commitment to its students, O’Donnell said in the press release. Tuition costs were also raised across graduate schools.
“We continue to balance the cost of providing high-quality academic programs and services with the need to limit tuition growth,” he stated.

Turns out Georgetown graduates not only get into Congress, they stay there. Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) has served 29 terms in Congress since he arrived in 1955, and he declared last month that he plans to run for a 30th term as well.
As the longest-serving representative currently in Congress, Dingell had plenty of experience to speak from in his visit Tuesday to the newly renovated Public Policy Institute.
The event, which was moderated by Dean of Public Policy Edward Montgomery, provided an open forum for audience members to ask Dingell questions ranging from his political stances to his experience in the House of Representatives.
In his introduction, Montgomery praised Dingell for his steadfast service to the country, which includes two years of Army service during World War II. “He has had a very distinguished legislative career after living in what John Brokaw called ‘The Greatest Generation,'” Montgomery said.
Dingell spoke about his time in the Army as well as the years that followed, touching on his work as a park ranger, a prosecutor and a researcher before following his father — another congressional representative — into politics. He then turned his attention to pressing policy issues.
Dingell addressed the polarization of the political spectrum, advocating for more dialogue between congressional colleagues. He said that the introduction of C-SPAN and the broadcast of congressional meetings had interrupted a tradition of interaction.
“When you watch my colleagues on the floor or in committee, you will see them looking at the camera, which is in the gallery, rather than looking at their colleagues,” he said. “That’s a bad thing. I’ve seen the day, and I’m very proud of it, when members were able to talk.”
Still, Dingell refused to say that bipartisanship is an idea of the past. Rather, he said, representatives are still working together across the political divide, and he anticipates that bipartisan legislation will become increasingly more important going forward.
“[Bipartisanship] was never dead, it’s not now dead and it will have to come back when the need is there,” he said.
Dingell did not shy away from addressing contentious issues including U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson’s January court decision that declared the individual mandate of last year’s health care reform unconstitutional. In response to a question regarding the decision, Dingell said that he believes Vinson’s verdict was out of line and poorly argued.
“First of all, bad decision, bad judge, bad interpretation of the law, bad consequences, and I don’t think it is going to be sustained,” he said.
Despite the difficulties facing this Congress, Dingell emphasized that he is optimistic about the outlook for this round of debate and legislation, though he remains cautious after last year’s laborious political battles.
“The Congress has, I hope, great promise,” he said.

Pepco’s chairman, president and chief executive officer testified before the House Economic Matters Committee Tuesday to answer for power failures that affected hundreds of thousands of D.C. residents last month.
Power outages during January’s snowstorms affected about 210,000 people, according to The George Washington University Hatchet. About 300 people were left without power for as many as five days, The Hatchet reported.
On campus, LXR and Nevils Halls and the Walsh Building all lost power during the Jan. 26 storm, according to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh. She said that the outage was caused by a fault in the main breaker to the complex.
“Facilities staff worked from the time of the outage throughout the night to rectify this situation, which required assistance from Pepco,” Pugh said in an email. “In order to restore power to the complex, a generator was brought in by Pepco late that evening and was delayed due to difficulties caused by the onset of inclement weather conditions.”
Power was restored before 4 a.m. the following morning, Pugh said.
Not all Pepco customers were as fortunate, however. In some areas, trees felled by the storm snapped power lines, resulting in extensive damage. This has caused many to question the company’s tree trimming policies and practices, according to the Hatchet.
Yaffet Menna’s (COL ’13) family lives locally, and his home lost power for almost eight hours during the storm. Outages are frequent in his neighborhood, Menna said, particularly when there is any kind of heavy rain or snowfall.
“Pepco has actually been terrible with the service in our neighborhood,” Menna said.
At the time of a 2009 survey Pepco customers were 70 percent more likely to experience a power outage than customers of other big city utilities, and outages lasted more than twice as long, according to an analysis by The Washington Post.
Pepco’s trial took place in Annapolis on Tuesday. Company executives addressed the January storm and the restoration efforts they have undertaken since then, according to a Pepco press release from earlier the same day. Pepco executives also appeared before the D.C. Public Service Commission yesterday, according to NBC Washington.
“I deeply regret the inconvenience and hardship that the power outages from this recent heavy snowstorm caused our customers and communities,” Pepco CEO Joseph Rigby said in his prepared trial remarks published in the Tuesday press release. “I am here to tell you that Pepco has been making and will continue to make changes to the way it conducts business and to improve our service reliability.”
According to another statement released by Pepco on Feb. 1, the company currently has 1,000 restoration personnel working on follow up repairs, and it has extended the call center hours.
As a result of the snowstorm and its aftermath, Pepco has also begun publicizing its six-point Reliability Enhancement Plan. This initiative will result in $574 million in company spending over the next five years, according to another Pepco statement on Feb. 7. The company will also re-examine their entire storm restoration process.

Bars and clubs around the District may see a significant decrease in police security over the coming months, as a Metropolitan Police Department program subsidizing the cost of privately hired officers faces heavy cuts.
MPD’s budget was cut by nearly $8 million for 2011 as a part of a series of budget cuts made by former Mayor Adrian Fenty at the end of 2010, according to the Proposed Gap-Closing Plan.
The MPD Reimbursable Detail Program was designed to allow D.C. businesses to hire off-duty MPD officers at half the officers’ usual wage. The difference was paid by the city government’s Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration. After the budget cuts, however, the ABRA will only pay one quarter of officers’ wages, forcing businesses to either foot the bill, hire fewer officers or stop using off-duty officers altogether. Off-duty officers are barred from providing security to bars outside of the program, according to Gwendolyn Crump, acting director MPD of communications.
Cuts to the program totaled $500,000, according to the Washington City Paper. MPD’s presence on the whole may be considerably lower in the future due to cuts across the board. Crump, however, said that MPD is ready to face the budget cuts due to careful planning.
“For the past four years, even before fiscal pressures had a significant impact on the District’s budget, Chief [Cathy] Lanier has focused on increasing the efficiency of available resources,” she said in an email.
But while a lower police presence could lead to increased crime, one Georgetown student at least is unconcerned by the potential decline of MPD cars in the neighborhood.
“I don’t like the decline in security, but with the passing of the new noise violation law, maybe a lower police presence isn’t such a bad thing,” Tommy Petriccione (COL ’14) said.

In a resolution passed Sunday, GUSA voted to create a committee that will decide the fate of the $3.4 million left in the now-defunct student activities fee endowment.
The Commission on Student Activities Fee Endowment Reform will be responsible for creating a plan to allocate the funds remaining in the account by April 25. Contributions to the endowment ended after the passage of SAFE reform last semester.
Fifteen students will head the commission initiated by the Finance and Appropriations Committee. The body’s final proposal can allocate the money to up to five sources.
Thirteen of the members will represent a diverse array of organizations including The Corp, Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union, the Student Activities Commission, the Club Sports Advisory Board, the Center for Social Justice, Georgetown Program Board, the Media Board, the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access, GUSA executive committee and the GUSA Senate.
The commission will also include two members of the student body who are not affiliated with any of these organizations. Any student may fill out the online nomination form that was sent out on Thursday and will be available for one week. The chair of the commission will be chosen by the GUSA Fin/App Committee out of the members of the commission without GUSA ties.
Fin/App Vice Chair Colton Malkerson (COL ’13) will moderate the commission.
Malkerson said that GUSA has sent out nomination forms to all of the organizations and hopes to have the committee formed within a week or two.
He added that including such a broad array of representatives on the commission was key.
“Every single person has paid into the endowment over the years. It’s a lot of money and it’s too important of an issue for just the seven members of FinApp to decide,” Malkerson said. “We hope that by bringing in representatives from across campus and expanding the conversation beyond GUSA we will hear the best ideas and have a more informed deliberation.”
So far, Rich Rinaldi (MSB ’12), former staff development director for The Hoya, has been chosen to represent the media board along with Georgetown’s NAACP president, Carolyn Chambers (COL ’11), who will be representing the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access. The two GUSA senators will be chosen during the Senate meeting next Sunday to sit in on the commission.
“Whether it’s students, alumni or administrators, everyone should come before the commission and present their ideas,” Malkerson said.
The commission will meet for the rest of the semester to discuss the endowment, solicit feedback from the campus community and produce a set of recommendations. The plan will then likely be put to a vote in a campus-wide referendum.

As tensions mount over D.C.’s noise law, one advocacy group is gaining recognition as a voice for one of the District’s largest demographics: students.
“College students make up one-sixth of the city’s population, and yet have virtually no political influence,” Scott Stirrett (SFS ’13) said. DC Students Speak, the group Stirrett chairs, is looking to change that — and the pan-university coalition is gaining muscle in city politics.
The group, which seeks to create a unified voice for D.C. college students on District-wide political issues, consists of about 35 representatives from Georgetown, The George Washington University, American University, Trinity Washington University and Catholic University.
About half of the representatives hail from Georgetown. The product of a Reimagine Georgetown grant, the group was founded in the winter of 2009.
Before this year, DC Students Speak comprised only a handful of students. But, the group moved into the spotlight by becoming a leading voice in debates over the campus plan. More recently, the organization has spearheaded a student campaign over amendments to D.C.’s noise laws, which dole out harsher penalties, including arrest, for noise violations. Petitions circulated by DC Students Speak opposing the changes and supporting the Campus Plan each boast over 1,000 signatures.
The group has also become a presence at town forums. At the last local town hall about Georgetown’s Campus Plan, DC Students Speak led a contingent of almost 50 students, according to Stirrett.
The body originally gained visibility through its Twitter page, which it uses to broadcast issues relevant to college students. It currently has over 500 followers. DC Students Speak also uses Facebook, a blog and op-eds in various school newspapers to reach out to students at different campuses.
Drew Spence, a sophomore at GWU and the only group representative from his school, said the group reached the GWU community through its Twitter and Facebook efforts.
An issue facing one college eventually surfaces at others across the District, Spence said.
“What happens at different schools sets precedent for the rest of the city,” he said. “We’re seeing that right now with the Georgetown Campus Plan. A few years ago the GWU campus plan was a really arduous process, and it turned into a battle [between] community and university.”
But other college students are not the only ones taking note.
DC Students Speak has also garnered recognition from Georgetown-area residents. Lenore Rubino, president of the Burleith Citizens’ Association, heard of DC Students Speak through news outlets and its blog. She said she supports the general concept of the organization.
“I like to see the good energy that goes into people expressing their right to have a voice,” she said.
Yet, despite the praise, Rubino believes DCSS is contributing to a negative, exaggerated image of the BCA, which has actively opposed the campus plan.
“I think there’s a basic disagreement, with the students thinking that their neighbors are out to get them, and that’s not the case at all,” she said. “That’s perpetuated through ignorance, blogs and things like that.”
Rubino noted that DCSS is not the perpetrator of these false images, but that it is “expanding the problem.”
Jake Sticka (COL ’13), Georgetown’s student representative on the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, said he supports the objectives of DCSS, but was critical of what he described as an “adversarial” relationship between DCSS and the neighborhood associations.
“The tone towards residents is to assume a degree of cynicism that they’re coming after the students, and I don’t think that’s always the case,” Sticka said. “The things that CAG and BCA say makes me understand why you would go after them. I just wouldn’t do it so personally.”
Stirrett agreed that many students have a negative perception of their neighbors, perpetuated by the community’s more vocal members that tend to show up to town halls.
“I think that not everyone living in Georgetown opposes the Campus Plan,” Stirrett said. “[CAG] might have 20 people go to a meeting, but does CAG represent the 14,000 people that live in this [ANC 2E district]? We’d say, as [indicated by] the interest shown in the different petitions, that is definitely not true.”
Stirrett pointed to the 1,350 petition signatures in favor of the campus plan. “Last time I checked, CAG’s petition had 175 signatures,” he said.
The campus plan has not been the only point of contention, however.
Recently, the new harsher penalties for noise violations in the District united furious students across the District. The petition DC Students Speak circulated got 1,200 online signatures in 48 hours, according to Stirrett.
Now, after consulting with lawyers and law professors, the group is considering a formal legal challenge to the amendment and published a post on its blog titled: “DC’s new noise ordinance is not just bad policy; it is unconstitutional.”
While the group has recently been eyeing concrete community challenges, it also has broader goals. One of the group’s key initiatives is getting students to register to vote in D.C.
“People should vote in the area that has the greatest effect on their local life,” Stirrett said. “Students spend nine months of the year here, and are affected by local laws.”
He added that in order for local politicians to take students’ concerns seriously, they need to register to vote.
“If the mayor of D.C. doesn’t consider college students his constituents, he’s obviously not going to take into consideration their concerns when drafting legislation like the recent noise bill,” Stirrett said.
To this end, the organization is planning a student registration drive in a few months. Yet, a large part of the motivation extends beyond voting. Advisory Neighborhood Commissions require their officeholders to be registered voters. There are currently only two college student ANC commissioners; there are over 250 commissioner seats across the District
Here, the group’s efforts are still fledgling — two students that DCSS supported were defeated in 2010 elections for ANC seats. Stirrett plans to ramp up the campaign efforts for the 2012 elections.
Sticka is one of those two students. He was elected in the winter of 2009 to represent Georgetown students, following the tenure of Aaron Golds (COL ’11). His district covers some townhouses and residence halls Village C East and West, Harbin, New South, Alumni Square, Village A, Kennedy, Renyolds and McCarthy, as well as the Jesuit Community. “I’m all about [DC Student Speak’s] general idea of getting students more involved in the process, and I really support registering to vote and having [student] voices heard,” Sticka said.
Ron Lewis, Chairman of the ANC 2E is proud to have Sticka on board.
“Our ANC is an example that people hold up and say, ‘this is how student representation should work,'” Lewis said.
D.C. Council Chairman Kwame R. Brown said he had not heard of DC Students Speak, but he does support its push for student voter registration.
“Every person who is of age and claims District residency should register to vote and avail themselves of the Democratic process,” Brown said in an email. “Voting is not only a right, but the civic duty of every American, and should never be acquiesced.”
According to Stirrett, not all members of D.C. government have supported the group’s student registration advocacy, however. Tom Smith, an ANC commissioner, told a member of the organization that college students should not register in D.C. He said that students should vote where they have the most influence in presidential elections, and that they would need a D.C. driver’s license to vote, which Stirrett says is untrue. Smith declined to comment.
Students can only effectively take a stand against adverse legislation by having a voice in the District, Stirrett said. This has come to forefront during the debate on the noise laws.
Spence agreed. He said that students and politicians should be able to work together.
“We believe the students and community can live harmoniously,” Spence said, “That’s what I think is not being communicated here. The city government has decided to push legislation that directly targets college students. We don’t want to be targeted; we want to be partners in the dialogue. DCSS is hoping to engage in the conversation and try to come to consensus.”

Four years ago, Georgetown’s Chapel Choir had a handful of members, little identity and a new director fresh out of graduate school. Now, the 40-member group performs for a growing crowd at the weekly 9:30 p.m. Sunday Mass and is gearing up for a trip to Italy to sing for the pope himself.
When Russell Weismann was hired as Georgetown’s first director of music and liturgy in 2007, he was charged with revamping the neglected choir. Seven students showed up for the first rehearsal.
“They didn’t really have an idea of who they were,” Weismann said.
But the choir grew quickly during the first year, driven by the dedication of its members.
Weismann said the group has had its share of failures, performing pieces that seemed to fall apart as the choir sang them. But these days, he said, its work has mostly been marked by success.
“More and more people are coming to the Mass,” said Robert Gregory (COL ’11), student director of the choir. “More and more people are becoming kind of groupies of the choir.”
Mary Kate Holman (COL ’11), the oldest member of the chorus, said the group’s preparation for their first annual Lessons and Carols for Advent service at Holy Trinity Church was a defining moment for them.
“It was this one day where we were all working towards this one beautiful thing,” she said.
Weismann said the positive feedback he received after the service convinced him that all their work was paying off.
“It kind of put us on the map,” he said.
The Chapel Choir is the largest student choir on campus and the primary choir for Dahlgren Chapel. They perform every week at the 9:30 p.m. Mass on Sundays for a congregation that has included community members from University President John J. DeGioia to O Street Resident Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.).
The choir sings a wide variety of music, including renaissance and contemporary works, to accompany the service.
“Music holds a very high place in the liturgy,” Gregory said. “It’s our responsibility to help them pray through song.”
Although spirituality is an important part of the choir’s mission, not all of its members are Catholic. Gregory counted Jewish, Mormon and Protestant students — along with a Jesuit — among the members.
“I think it really speaks to the way that music connects people. It’s such a universal language,” he said.
Holman said that the choir has become a community over the past few years, bound by spirituality, social events and a tradition of group back-rubs before warming up at rehearsal.
“We strike a really good balance of fun and serious,” she said.
In May, about 37 of the group’s 40 members will travel to Italy to perform at sites in Rome, Florence and Assisi. Among their stops will be a Mass for Georgetown alumni at the Church of the Gesu, the mother church of the Society of Jesus and a Sunday Mass at the Vatican.
“We have known about the Italy pilgrimage for well over a year now, and it is still honestly a very surreal idea for me,” said Monica Perrigino (COL ’12), who has been a member of the choir since her freshman year.
For Weismann, the trip will be bittersweet. This year, he has been working full time as the organist and associate director of music at the Basilica of the National Shrine while continuing to work with the choir, but after this year he will be leaving Georgetown to dedicate more time to the Basilica.
“I kind of feel like a member of the Class of 2011,” he said, looking back on his four years at Georgetown. “I feel like this trip is a great way to go out with a bang.”
