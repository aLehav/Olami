The GUSA senate voted Monday to establish a polling station in the entrance lobby of O’Donovan Dining Hall for the upcoming referendum on Student Activity Fee Endowment proposals.
Students will have the opportunity to vote on three separate plans for the use of the $3.4 million available. The Social Innovation and Public Service Fund, a Georgetown Energy initiative for solar panels and the New South Student Center effort have been allocated portions of the total sum. Each proposal is being put to an independent referendum.
Three computers will be used for electronic voting between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. from Jan. 24 to 26. The station will be staffed by two student poll watchers, who will be unassociated with the Georgetown University Student Association and receive compensation for their work.
Hiring selected poll monitors will prevent student volunteers who have strong opinions regarding the referendum from affecting voting results, according to Senate Vice Speaker Nate Tisa (SFS ’14).
The polling stations in O’Donovan Hall, chosen because of the large number of students who pass through it each day, are being introduced in an attempt to increase student participation. Traditionally, students are notified of GUSA elections through email, but online voting often did not result in high levels of participation in the past. The new polling places would supplement independent online voting.
According to Tisa, if the polling station helps boost participation, a similar system may be used in next month’s election for the GUSA executive.
Town halls for the SAFE referendum will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday at 8 p.m. in Reiss 283.
The senate also voted unanimously to change the date on which the members of the next executive team will transition into their new positions.
The next GUSA president and vice president, who will be elected on Feb. 23, will now be sworn in by the Saturday after spring break. Previously, the winning ticket took office almost immediately after being elected. The new executive team will now also have three weeks after their election to propose either a continuation or a modified structure of the executive cabinet to the senate.
According to Tisa, the longer timeframe will provide a smoother transition for the next members of the executive branch.

For better or for worse, Lydia Brown’s identity has been shaped in large part by her autism.
“Autism affects every aspect of my life,” she said. “I would completely not be me if I were not autistic.”
Drawing on her experiences, Brown (COL ’15) wrote and submitted two bills,  one before the House of Representatives and one in the Senate in Massachusetts, proposing a mandatory training program about autism for law enforcement and correction officers in the state. The training would focus on how to recognize and communicate with autistic people in high-tension situations.
Brown began work on the bill, which was submitted to the state legislature last January, during the summer before her junior year of high school. The effort began as part of a community service project required by her school.
“I wanted to come up with a project that would use my interests and skills to serve the community,” she said.
Because of her interest in criminal justice and law enforcement, Brown decided to focus on the intersection between autistic people and the criminal justice system.
“I am very keenly aware that the majority of autism [advocacy] has to do with education, employment and housing issues, which are very important issues … but very little attention was focused toward what happens when autistic people encounter the criminal justice system,” she said. “Autistic people are much more likely to be the victim of a crime than someone without a disability.”
According to Brown, her bill seeks to protect both law enforcement officers and autistic people.
“Officers who don’t know anything about communication differences between different people are going to end up in really unfortunate situations,” she said.
Ideally, the training and education that that the bill advocates would highlight common speech and behavior characteristics of autistic people, crisis intervention, treatment in correctional facilities and methods of interviewing and arrest.
Law enforcement officers in Massachusetts as well as local and national autism organizations have vocalized their support for the bill, though others have raised concerns about how to finance the required training.
Currently, the bills are pending in their second session of the joint committee on public safety and homeland security.
Brown has also employed her personal experiences to advocate for autistic people’s rights, particularly as an intern for the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network, and speak out against arrests of autistic children for misbehavior in school.
“If an autistic person acts out at school, the student should be disciplined through the school [as opposed to through the criminal justice system],” she said.
Brown’s most recent project, the Autism Education Project hopes to provide resources for people with autism or other disabilities that feel abused by the criminal justice system. The initiative has gained support from the ASAN and aims to promote the type of training that is advocated in her bill in other states throughout the country.
Brown uses her blog, “Autistic Hoya,” to discuss issues facing the autistic community in order to assert the rights of austic people instead of ask for medicine or charity. Through the blog, she updates her readers on the bills’ progress and her endeavors at Georgetown.
In the upcoming weeks, she plans to send out an email reminding her audience to urge the legislative committee to push through the bill and write letters to garner the support of larger organizations for the bill.

In a week of concerts, discussions and community service, the university honored Martin Luther King Jr. in its 10th annual celebration of his legacy.
The weeklong event commemorating King’s academic, spiritual and political legacy began with Monday’s Let Freedom Ring! concert at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The concert included performances by Grammy award-winning artist Bobby McFerrin, famous for his single “Don’t Worry, Be Happy,” accompanied by the Let Freedom Ring! celebration choir.
Professor Clarence Jones, a former speechwriter for King, was awarded the John Thompson Jr. Legacy of a Dream Award during the event.
“We value Dr. King for his academic genius and the work he produced and that we study today at Georgetown,” MLK week committee member George Smith (COL ’14) said. “We look at his spiritual side and how that guided him through his work. And service — Dr. King did this nation such a service, and each event is used to pay honor to him, reflect, remember, relive and recapitulate aspects of hislegacy.”
Events later in the week included an academic panel Tuesday focusing on the influence of King’s work on social and economic justice, a memorial service at Dahlgren Chapel Wednesday and a reflection event in Copley Formal Lounge Thursday in which students and faculty expressed their appreciation for the civil rights leader through music, dance and spoken word.
“I thought the events did an amazing job of showing how Martin Luther King Jr.’s legacy remains relevant in our culture today, and how the issues he faced, we face as well,” Tucker Cholvin (SFS ’15) said.
According to Smith, the reflection event, which is now in its fifth year, had a special significance for its student volunteers.
“It was started by students for students,” Smith said. “There wasn’t anything like it for students to get together and share their experiences with King’s legacy personally.”
The celebration will conclude with a day of service Saturday, when students will travel to Ward 7 to work with local community organizations in honor of King.
“It is a celebration, a time for us to look at this American icon and learn from his legacy in every way possible,” Smith said. “This is one thing I will remember throughout my time at Georgetown.”

The D.C. Council recently redrew the map of the District’s Advisory Neighborhood Commissions in a move that could increase Georgetown’s representation in the local ANC from one to two seats.
Ten years ago, ANC 2E contained two districts composed primarily of Georgetown students, according to ANC 2E Vice Chair Tom Birch. That second seat was lost during the 2001 redistricting process, when it was reconfigured to include a greater mixture of students and residents.
Today, the majority of Georgetown students are grouped within one single-member voting district,SMD 2E04, a constituency currently represented by ANC commissioner Jake Sticka (COL ’13).
The new guidelines, which were delivered in a ruling late last month, create an eighth ANC 2Ecommissioner position, one Birch says will most likely go to a university student when commissioners are elected in November.
“I think it’s quite a given because that new SMD that the new plan creates is almost 100 percent student residents,” Birch said.
Birch added that he approves of the new plan because the new boundaries are more equitable and consistent with D.C. regulations, which place the number of residents per single member district at 2,000.
“I think what it does is it attempts to create districts that have some cohesiveness to them but also to adhere as best we can to the target number of residents in each single-member district,” he said.
Despite the added seat, some believe that the size of the campus warrants further representation for university students.
Sticka has long advocated a greater number of seats for Georgetown students. The initial redistricting proposal filed by ANC 2E would have created two constituencies with 2,581 students each, which provoked protest from students who complained that the proposal packed too many students into the districts.
Sticka and John Flanagan (SFS ’14) put forth an alternative proposal that would have allowed a third seat to be contested between Georgetown students and residents.
While Sticka considers the increase from one to two seats to be a step in the right direction, he expressed disappointment that a third student seat is not a possibility.
“I think that these districts are better than those that were in place in the last 10 years but still not completely equitable. … Considering that each ANC district is roughly 2,000 people in size and that Georgetown has over 6,500 undergraduates in the community, in addition to many graduate students, it strikes me that a plan that would allow for three students to be elected would be equitable and fair,”Sticka said.
Alykhan Merali (SFS ’13), co-chair for the Georgetown chapter of D.C. Students Speak, also maintains that a third district should have been drawn in a way that would allow Georgetown students to contest the seat.
“Some of the dorms are being separated in a way that would make it impossible for students to get [an additional seat],” he said.
Sticka said that while the second student seat on the ANC is unlikely to bolster Georgetown’s position in neighborhood politics, the two elected students will be an important resource to one another.
“I think on a commission of eight it would be overly optimistic to say that a second seat will change the overall dynamic,” Sticka said. “But having an additional commissioner will be powerful to both [of the student commissioners]. Knowing that there’s someone else on the ANC that will support them, collaborate with them and talk with them about ideas in advance of meetings will be helpful to future commissioners.”
