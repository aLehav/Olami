A student was robbed at knifepoint on the 1800 block of 38th Street at 9:10 p.m. Saturday, according to the Department of Public Safety.
A Public Safety Alert emailed to the campus community Sunday afternoon stated that two suspects emerged from nearby bushes while the victim was walking. One suspect grabbed the victim from behind while the other displayed a knife. The suspects then took the victim’s wallet and fled the scene. Metropolitan Police responded to the scene and searched the area but did not find the suspects.
According to the PSA, the suspects were black males wearing dark clothing, with bandanas covering their faces. The suspect who displayed the knife is described as about 5-foot-9 and 190 to 200 pounds, while the other is described as about 5-foot-10 and 175 pounds.
Representatives of DPS and MPD could not be reached for comment at press time.
