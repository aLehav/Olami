Georgetown University Dining Services workers ratified a three-year contract with their employer Aramark Higher Education Thursday, exactly eleven months after their union was certified.
Workers from O’Donovan Hall, the Jesuit Residence, Cosi, Starbucks and the Preclinical Building’s Dr. Mug organized under the umbrella of UNITE HERE, which represents members of the food, manufacturing, textile and laundry services, last April.
A tentative agreement, reached in early February, included a 50-cent-per-hour wage increase for each of the three years and coverage of 80 percent of employees’ healthcare costs for the next two years and 85 percent during the third year.
“Contract negotiations [are] an experience I’ll never forget,” Dante Crestwell, a Georgetown University Dining Services employee and member of the contract negotiating committee, said in a statement published by UNITE HERE. “It showed me how much a determined and dedicated group of people standing up to the company and not backing down can do. We won with the help of Georgetown students, who fought alongside us and supported us from the very beginning.”

Georgetown University Student Association President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) and Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) campaigned in 2011 to improve student life, neighborhood relations andGUSA accountability.
As the pair leaves the executive office, Meaney is still surprised that he and Laverriere won the race.
“About a year ago, upon taking the oath of office, I said that it was funny to think that a grumpy, awkward kid from Long Island and a kid with a stutter from Tucson had been elected president and vice president of the Georgetown University Student Association,” he said in his farewell address to the GUSA senate Sunday. “It’s still funny, because Greg is still awkward and grumpy, and I still stutter.”
Meaney and Laverriere initially focused on initiatives that could bring tangible, immediate benefits to students such as the reinstitution of the College Readership program and the inauguration of Project Move-In, during which GUSA members helped new students settle in to their housing on the first day of New Student Orientation.
According to Meaney, these initiatives helped him and Laverriere build enough political capital to devote the second half of their term to working toward the long-term goals on which they had campaigned.
“We had been building and building our capital for our big things, which were Code of Conduct, Student Life Report and Access to Benefits,” he said. “People run on [these initiatives] every year. We made progress, and that’s something we’re proud of.”
A FIGHT FOR STUDENT RIGHTS
A primary focus of Meaney and Laverriere’s campaign was reforming the university’s Student Code of Conduct. The duo has been working with university officials to revise the code since November, when it released its proposed changes. They hope to raise the burden of proof required to issue a disciplinary violation and better communicate student rights during the judicial process.
Their campaign also promised to revamp the Access to Benefits Policies, which outline the benefits granted to student groups. While the Student Life Report, released Saturday, provided detailed recommendations for reforming these policies, Meaney and Laverriere’s administration did not tangibly change them during its term.
The pair, however, was able to implement initiatives absorbed from other 2011 campaigns. Most notably, they charged their former election adversaries, Ace Factor (COL ’12) and James Pickens (COL ’12), with the establishment of the Student Advocacy Office. The initiative was the focus of Factor and Pickens’ campaign platform and is intended to provide a resource for students faced with disciplinary violations.
CATERING TO THE STUDENT
Following through on the Student Activities Fee Endowment reform would have been a significant issue for any ticket that won the 2011 election. In a student body referendum passed in January, $3.4 million was allocated to Georgetown Energy, the Social Innovation and Public Service Fund and the New South Student Center renovation effort. While the GUSA Senate Finance and Appropriations committee led the reform, the executive also played a part.
“We wouldn’t have been able to get the necessary coordination of the student body or even get the reforms through without Mike and Greg’s knowledge and commitment,” Senate Speaker Adam Talbot (COL ’12) said.
While running for office, the two also promised to create a website allowing students to submit ideas and vote on other suggestions related to university issues of concern. An online forum allowing interactive user feedback, called Hoya Ideas Community, was launched Tuesday.
Meaney and Laverriere also proposed changes to Georgetown dining options in their campaign, but an idea to institute hot Grab ‘n’ Go meals proved unsuccessful. According to Meaney, the project was dropped after GUSA ran into issues with sanitary regulations.
TAKING GUSA TO THE STREETS
As promised in their campaign, Meaney and Laverriere made efforts to improve neighborhood relations by pushing for the M Street shuttle, offering Georgetown residents tickets to campus events and testifying at neighborhood commission meetings. But neighbors have continued to voice their complaints about Georgetown students and the 2010 Campus Plan process has been drawn out much longer than expected.
“If Georgetown was running a convent, these neighbors would say we were praying too [loudly],” Senior Counselor Sam Ungar (COL ’12) said.
Meaney and Laverriere also placed particular campaign emphasis on the creation of a GUSA Rides program to supplement SafeRides with extended hours of service on weekend nights. During their administration, they ran into funding difficulties that prevented the implementation of the idea. Instead, the executives refocused their efforts on expanding the number of GUSA volunteers driving SafeRidesvans and instituted the Snack Cab prize program.
Meaney and Laverriere also promised the creation of a Hoya Housing Finder for students seeking off-campus roommates. Although some initial research was conducted, the plan never came to fruition.
Over the summer, GUSA’s scope expanded beyond the Georgetown neighborhood with the “Do We Have A Deal Yet?” campaign. Meaney spearheaded a coalition of more than 140 university student body presidents that demanded a compromise in the federal debt limit negotiations.
Although the effort had little to do with the university, Laverriere defended it saying that a failure to compromise on the debt ceiling debate could have reduced funding for Pell grants, a form of federal financial aid.
In his final address Sunday, Meaney asserted that Georgetown’s place in the nation’s capital gives it the opportunity to have a voice in federal issues.
“Our location allows us to put students, and our generation more broadly, at the heart of the national conversation,” he said.
In his speech, Meaney advised GUSA members to focus on projects aligned with GUSA’s strengths.
“Moving forward, I hope GUSA can capitalize on the tremendous foundation that has been built over the last four years,” he said. “I hope that it realizes its limitations and continues to build on its strengths. I am happy to have played my part.”

Most Georgetown undergraduates turn 21 amid a throng of friends at The Tombs and receive a smeared, black stamp on their foreheads to inaugurate their first night of legal drinking.
Alex Horton (COL ’13) got a different kind of mark.
“I got a pink belly for it,” Horton said. “It’s when a group of people hold you down and take off your shirt and slap you in the stomach until [it] turns red.”
According to Horton, getting “pink-bellied” is a birthday tradition in the army.
Horton spent his 21st birthday in Kuwait, just days before crossing the border into Iraq to serve his tour of duty. Since he was on base at the time, Horton did not get to partake in any drinking, although he was allowed to skip trash cleanup for the night.
FROM THE FRONT TO THE HILLTOP
After returning from Iraq, Horton took up a job at the Department of Veterans Affairs. But getting an education remained a priority for him.
“[The] George Washington [University] was the most logical choice because it was close to work, it was on the Metro line, I knew people who went there, they had a good veterans program,” Horton said. “I never even considered [Georgetown] as an option.”
Only a few days before the deadline, Horton decided to apply to Georgetown, and to his surprise, he got in.
One major problem for Horton was Georgetown’s requirement that traditional undergrads take a full course load. Only seniors are permitted to take fewer than 12 credits; other undergraduates wishing to attend part-time must do so through the school of continuing studies.
For a veteran working 40 hours per week, taking at least four classes was a hard sell.
But swayed by the prestige and quality of a Georgetown education, Horton ultimately made the choice to study on the Hilltop.
BRIDGING THE DIVIDE
For T.M. Gibbons-Neff (COL ’15), the lone veteran in the current freshman class, being a member of the boxing team and working as a treasurer for Georgetown University Student Veterans of America helped to smooth a tough transition into academia.
“A lot of people don’t understand that when you leave the Marines, you’re not just leaving a job, you’re leaving a family,” Gibbons-Neff said. “It’s kind of hard to relate to some of the younger kids here, but you know, it’s a challenge and it’s fun.”
Horton often struggles with how open to be about his experiences with other students.
“The day you introduce yourself is the hardest day for me,” Horton said. “It all goes back to how much I want to reveal.”
Horton said that sometimes he feels like other students try to distance themselves from veterans.
“It’s hard to know what’s a generational thing and what’s an experience thing,” he said.
GUSVA President Colby Howard (SFS ’12) agreed.
“Some of the challenge [is] merely age,” Howard said. “Also, the type of experience and intensity of experiences you’ve had overseas.”
He added that some students tend to have preconceptions about veterans.
“The overarching stereotype is that a service member isn’t smart,” Howard said.
But Howard, Horton and Gibbons-Neff agreed that the interactions they have had with other students and faculty have been overwhelmingly positive.
“I was ready to not like students in class,” Horton said, “but a lot of them turn[ed] out to be insightful and smart.”
SEEKING SUPPORT
Veterans face a very specific set of concerns when adjusting to college; juggling course schedules and financial aid while making a shift from military life to civilian life.
“You’re going from something very structured, very regimented … to this university,” said David Shearman (SFS ’11) who served in the Army for six years in Kosovo, Iraq and Germany. “If you don’t have someone … lead you through it the first time or at least show you how to navigate it … it can be very overwhelming.”
Until recently, Georgetown did not have an office to accommodate incoming veteran students aside from a single employee who handled GI Bill-related paperwork among several other responsibilities.
A veteran himself, Shearman applied to take the helm of the fledgling Veterans Office, which was established in February 2011. In the year since, the university has promoted Shearman from a part-time to a full-time employee while he pursues a Master’s degree in security studies.
Currently, the office works with 425 students, including students on active duty, veterans who have left active duty and dependents and spouses of veterans. This year, 18 students from that group are enrolled in a traditional undergraduate program.
According to Howard and Shearman, the number of student veterans will likely increase this year as active duty military return from Iraq and potentially from Afghanistan.
In the future, Shearman hopes to increase programming activities.
“There’s a lot of opportunities, I think, in the academic departments, working with faculty, working with … the women’s center, [the] LGBTQ center and other campus resources to really use the veteran experience to expand … the richness of the environment on campus,” Shearmansaid.
INCREASING PRESENCE AND PERSPECTIVE
Howard and Shearman agree that veterans add diversity to the campus.
“In the times that we’re in with all the world conflicts, [there are] always questions about defense policy, national security policy, foreign affairs,” Shearman said. “[A]s you see the number of student veterans at Georgetown increase, you’re going to have a richer dialogue on thosethings.”
The two also said that Georgetown has begun working toward active recruitment, which entails traveling to military bases and veterans’ organizations to increase awareness of Georgetown there.
“We want to bring more student veterans to Georgetown,” Howard said.
Plans to accomplish this are already in the works under the banner of the Georgetown Veterans Admission Project, which is being coordinated by GUSVA and will eventually be run by the Office of Admissions. Though the project is still in its beginning stages, project’s goal is for veterans to compose 1 percent of every incoming freshman class.
Howard also hopes to add a veteran perspective to Blue and Gray’s campus tours as well as have a certified guide printed by the admissions offices to help veterans during the application process.
“I think student veterans could definitely stand to have a little more exposure on campus,” Shearmansaid.

The Georgetown University Students Association released its Student Rights Pamphlet Thursday, drawing to a close an initiative that has been in the works for over a year.
The guide is intended to be a digestible resource for navigating the policies of the Department of Public Safety, the Code of Student Conduct, the Student Neighborhood Assistance Program, Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Services and the Metropolitan Police Department.
Work on the initiative began in the GUSA senate last February. While the process took off this academic year, it was slightly delayed as Director of Student Conduct Judy Johnson, Director of Student Affairs Anne Koester and other university representatives reviewed the language.
“We wanted to make sure that we weren’t putting in anything that was misleading,” GUSA Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) said. “We were … just waiting on having that information.”
Efforts to create the document were spearheaded by GUSA Chief of Staff Michael Barclay (COL ’12) and Laverriere, as well as Student Advocacy Office Directors Ace Factor (COL ’12) and James Pickens (COL ’12).
Factor and Pickens used the knowledge gleaned from their experience with the SAO to ensure the pamphlet addressed the most pressing student rights issues, like how to appeal Student Code of Conduct violations.
The document will be printed and distributed in the SAO and Students of Georgetown, Inc., locations after spring break.
“It’ll be one of the final things [GUSA President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12)] and I do as executive,” Laverriere said.
Meaney and Pickens, however, will continue to serve on the Disciplinary Review Committee as GUSA representatives until July 1.
In addition, all of the student responsibilities set forth in the proposed changes to the Student Code of Conduct and Bill of Students Rights and Responsibilities released in November have been finalized, according to Laverriere.
However, the university has yet to agree to codify the changes to student rights in the code. By the end of their term on the review committee, Meaney and Pickens hope to further outline the burden of proof and failure to comply standards for code violations.
Overall, GUSA hopes to make the Student Code of Conduct easier to navigate and use as a resource, although it is not focusing on one specific issue within the code, according to Laverriere.
“I don’t think [that] with the Code of Conduct there is only one silver bullet,” he said.

The Georgetown University Student Association Finance and Appropriations Committee released a draft budget Thursday allocating its $960,000 in student activities fee money for the coming school year.
The amount of available funds increased by $160,000 from last year, allowing the Fin/App Committee to meet about 64 percent of the requests it received.
“Our goal was to give the most support to clubs and minimize the impact of the budget cuts,” Fin/App Chair Colton Malkerson (COL ’13) said. “From here on, there will be no substantial increase in student activities fee, so we expect this draft to serve as a precedent, a template for future budgets.”
All of the funding advisory boards, with the exception of the Advisory Board for Club Sports, saw their funding increase for fiscal year 2013. However, the ABCS was allocated $228,087, the largest amount within GUSA’s budget at nearly 24 percent. Although the allocation falls nearly $50,000 short of the board’s request, Malkerson justified the cut based on the large amount of funding for club sports in fiscal year 2012.
“We overshot on them, and we need to cut back to a more reasonable figure this year,” he said.
The Center for Social Justice received $180,000, the second-highest allocation of all groups.
“The fact that the Student Life Report indicated that the CSJ programs are one of the notable strengths of Georgetown makes me think we should fund them as much as possible,” Fin/App Committee member Bridget Power (COL ’12) said.
The Student Activities Commission will receive $150,000, a 67 percent increase from last year’s allocation. According to Fin/App Committee members, the increase should help SAC to fund newly formed student groups. The commission will also no longer have to allocate money to the Georgetown University Lecture Fund and SAC Fair, which were both regarded as independent entities in the draft budget.
The Lecture Fund, which turned to GUSA for funding because of SAC’s stipulation on its budget, was allocated $60,000, a 37 percent increase in funding for programming over what it received from SAC.
The Performing Arts Advisory Council was allocated $45,000, although the committee denied funding for a new air conditioner in Poulton Hall Theater for the second consecutive year. Committee members believed such capital improvements are the responsibility of University Facilities and Student Housing.
The Freshman, Sophomore and Junior Class Committees, which did not receive any funding from either GUSA or SAC in fiscal year 2012, will now be funded by the student activities fee money as well.
GUSA itself was the only group that received more funding than it requested. Fin/App committee members said the additional funding should be allocated to the GUSA Fund, which will in turn fund groups whose requests were denied. These include the Walsh Exchange, the Georgetown Office of Leadership Development and Illuminate Lauinger, a recipient of the 2011 ReImagine Georgetown grant.
The draft budget will be open to public critique and appeal until March 15. The Fin/App Committee will finalize the budget and send it to the GUSA senate for ratification after spring break.

While the Alternative Spring Break trips through the Center for Social Justice attract hundreds of students, a handful of Hoyas will traverse the globe with other programs next week.
Through an Outdoor Education trip to Nicaragua, 14 students and two guides will help build irrigation canals in local schoolyards as well as climb volcanoes, surf and horseback ride.
According to Lindsey Doyle (SFS ’13), who will serve as a guide on the trip, the program is a chance for many students explore a new culture and ecosystem.
“One of the things that Outdoor Education offers to students is the high adventure, Outdoor [Education] aspect,” she said. “It gives them exposure to a place they might not otherwise get to see.”
Twelve students on this year’s trip to Rwanda will witness the rebuilding of a post-conflict country first-hand. The program, organized by the African Studies Program and the International Development Certificate, was started by professors Maria Louise Wagner and Scott Taylor last year.
“It’s an opportunity to examine development broadly conceived,” Taylor, who will lead the trip this year, said. “Rwanda is unique in terms of the progress that it has made in the 18 years since the genocide.”
According to Alex Moran (SFS ’13) who went on the trip last year, Rwanda was a perfect case study for economic development.
“It’s really stable, especially considering what countries surround it. I think more professors should take students on trips to do research,” she said.
Moran added that the trip provided an experience unavailable in the District.
“It was very authentic the whole time we were there,” she said, describing a ride on a rickety ferry during which she was sandwiched between two women holding chickens. “You’ve just never seen anything like it before.”
For students who want to stick a little closer to home, Teach for America and Deloitte offer a spring break trip to Memphis. In the four-day program, four Georgetown students will work with school children in low-income areas to address education inequity.
The program also serves as a recruitment tool for Deloitte. According to the company, it has hired 127 trip participants since 2008.
Four students won’t leave campus at all for break, and instead will join 46 students from other universities on the Urban Plunge spring break trip sponsored by InterVarsity. The program, which will explore Southeast D.C., focuses on urban issues from a faith-based perspective.
“We’re trying to give students an integrated world view of doing social justice from a Bible-based perspective,” Kate Perkins, an InterVarsity staff member and trip coordinator, said.
According to Perkins, the trip includes community service, speakers and travel in the District. One of the issues the program will discuss this year is racial division within the church.
For Joanna Foote (SFS ’13), a past participant, Urban Plunge was an eye-opening experience.
“I went on the trip my freshman year, and it was a great opportunity to both learn more about D.C. and see how my Christian faith relates to urban issues,” she wrote in an email.

After launching its partnership with Grockit, an online interactive test-prep service, in October, the university is looking to expand the pilot program this spring.
According to Randy Bass, executive director of the Center for New Designs in Learning & Scholarship, the purpose of the partnership is to understand students’ natural learning patterns and better monitor their study habits.
The university has been working to implement the program since the fall but will soon began to solicit feedback.
The relationship between the university and the company began when the administration reached out to the test-prep company last fall.
“In doing research across campus, we found the company that was doing really innovative stuff and got a lot of success, and we just wanted to explore what they were like,” Chief Innovation Officer Michael Wang said.
Grockit, founded in 2007, is a study program for standardized tests, including the GRE, LSAT and GMAT.
“It tracks every learning step you’ve taken. … It’s this constant system that gives you constant feedback toward all of your questions … so you can understand what problem you’re having and the concepts behind them,” Wang said.
Wang, Bass and Victor Reinoso, senior adviser for new project development to the university president and CFO, are helping carry the initiative forward under the newly appointed chief information officer, Lisa Davis.
According to Bass, the partnership is a means of necessary innovation.
“No longer can a university afford the self-perception that it alone can provide all the services needed for a robust learning environment through its own IT services. Creative partnerships are absolutely necessary,” Bass wrote in an email.
Grockit uses social and collaborative study tools — Facebook study rooms, audio conferencing and chat room peer tutoring, for example — that Bass believes are invaluable to the power of social learning.
“I also think that Georgetown students, while ambitious, are more cooperative than competitive,” Bass wrote. “So the social tools and collaborative study capacities seem well suited to what I have found to be a widespread generous intelligence of GU students, in general.”

President John J. DeGioia and other D.C. area university presidents signed on to Mayor Vincent Gray’s College and University Sustainability Pledge Wednesday.
The pledge, a voluntary public agreement between the D.C. government and its institutions of higher education to support a more socially, economically and environmentally sustainable District, was publicly launched at a ceremony at American University.
Signatories agreed to adopt policies and develop projects that will enhance the District’s overall sustainability in exchange for support from the D.C. government.
Gray said he hopes the agreement will help make D.C. the greenest college town in the United States.
“We are the first in the nation to have this kind of university collaboration for sustainability,” he said. “If we don’t do this, we will have participated in destroying the planet.”
The signatories, which include American University, The George Washington University, Trinity Washington University, Gallaudet University, Catholic University, Howard University, the Corcoran College of Art and Design and the University of the District of Columbia, in addition to Georgetown, will create sustainability plans with specific targets and must report their results by August 2014.
Many of the participating universities have already made efforts towards greater sustainability. According to a statement from Karen Frank, assistant vice president for facilities and student housing, the university recycled over half the campus’s waste last year and has reduced its carbon footprint by 17 percent since 2005.
The statement added that several buildings on campus, including the Rafik B. Hariri Building, the Southwest Quadrangle and the soon-to-be-completed Regents Hall have received Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification for their environmentally friendly features.
DeGioia, who is president of the D.C. Consortium of Universities, also spoke at the event Wednesday.
“Through our work together, we’ll be able to strengthen our commitment to sustainability in the universities and the city,” he said. “We are honored to take a leadership role in advancing the mayor’s pledge.”
