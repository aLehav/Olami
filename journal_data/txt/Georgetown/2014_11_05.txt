D.C. Councilmember Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4) won the race for D.C. mayor Tuesday, defeating opponents David Catania (SFS ’90, LAW ’94) and Carol Schwartz, both running as independents.
Bowser earned 55 percent of the vote, with 80,303 votes. Catania, a councilmember-at-large, came in second, earning 36 percent of the vote and Schwartz earned 7.2 percent of the vote, putting her in third.
After beating incumbent Mayor Vincent Gray in the Democratic primary last April, Bowser consistently held the lead in the polls throughout the campaign, holding a four-point lead over Catania in a poll conducted by D.C. pollster released Oct. 4.
Bowser also snagged endorsements from President Barack Obama as well as from The Washington Post.
During her campaign, Bowser has promised to produce more affordable housing, keep Chancellor of Education Kaya Henderson (SFS ’92, GRD ’07) in office and build more middle schools.

Recreational marijuana use was legalized in D.C. on Tuesday.
With 100 percent of precincts reporting, 95,531 D.C. voters — 69.4 percent of the vote — voted in favor of Initiative 71, permitting the use and cultivation of marijuana in the District.
Under the new legislation, adults over the age of 21 will be legally permitted to possess up to two ounces of marijuana and grow up to six marijuana plants at home, provided that no more than three of them are mature.
The legislation will now enter a 60-day congressional review period. If neither Congress nor the D.C. Council acts during this 60-day period, the bill will become law.
