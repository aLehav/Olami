Last Friday, eight teams of students, joined by some enthusiastic younger participants, danced the night away at Hoyathon, Georgetown’s annual dance marathon in Sellinger Lounge. The event raised nearly $8,500 for the Children’s National Medical Center, the D.C. affiliate of the Children’s Miracle Network.
Co-Chairs Jess McCamy (COL ’11) and Kat Tuckett (COL ’11) and 10 other board members have been planning the event since September. Prior to the event, the eight registered teams raised $6,000, though the event itself raised nearly $2,500 more. The nine members of the winning team, The Flying Muffins, raised over $1,000. Hoyathon also received numerous in-kind donations from Chipotle, Johnny Rockets, Wingo’s, The Tombs, Wisemiller’s, Coke Zero and other organizations.
The Phantoms, Cabaret, Superfood, the Saxatones, Pep Band and the Capitol G’s performed at the event. The Irish Step Team and Jiwani also attended and taught participants some of their dance moves.
About 100 students participated in the dance marathon, and about 25 of them danced for 16 hours straight.
Each hour of the dance marathon had a different theme, such as Boy Bands vs. Pop Princesses, Disney, Middle School Dance, Diva, Bling Bling and Superheroes, which kept dancers motivated between 1 a.m. and 7 a.m. Dancers also played freeze dance, musical chairs, trivia games and had dance-offs throughout the night. Other activities including Twister, beanbag tosses, a giant Connect Four, hulahoops and arcade basketball hoops were set up around the dance floor.
One team, You Can Have It Your Way But Don’t Get Crazy, was not worried about getting tired or bored, however.
“We’ll be inventing a new dance move every hour,” Jillian Dunning (SFS ’10) said. According to the Hoyathon’s fundraising Web site, Dunning and her fellow group members raised $270 prior to the event.
Shortly after the 8 p.m. kickoff, Olivia, a member of the CMN Champions Program, arrived with her mother and Jon Hewitt, the CMN representative who worked with Hoyathon board members. Amanda, another member of the CMN Champions Program, also attended with her family.
McCamy said in an e-mail that she really enjoyed watching the children from CMN dancing with the older students.
“They were singing and dancing with Cabaret, requesting Miley Cyrus at the DJ table and dancing their shoes off – literally,” McCamy wrote.
At the end of Hoyathon on Saturday morning, Jessica, a member of the CMN Champions Program, arrived with her family. Jessica is a spina bifida patient who has been going to CMN since she was born. McCamy and the other board members were delighted to have her at the Hoyathon.
“We love seeing her every year. She’s become a staple part of our group and told us she thinks of us as big sisters,” McCamy said.”

Thousands of conservatives from across the country, Georgetown students among them, flocked to the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, held at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel in D.C.’s Woodley Park from Thursday through Saturday.
The largest annual gathering of conservatives nationwide, the attendees included everyone from well-known politicians and pundits to grassroots activists and ordinary civilians. 54 percent of attendees were college students.
“It was like a Star Trek convention for conservatives,” said Shawn Summers (COL ’12), an intern with the political blog FrumForum.com and a CPAC press attendee. “It’s not a serious policy discussion, it’s a pep rally celebrating the party.”
This year’s convention was the largest ever with over 10,000 attendees reflecting the growing concern of the American populace with the actions of the federal government and the increasing national debt. According to Summers, the mood of the attendees was a mix of anger at the Obama administration and a sense of triumph following recent gubernatorial victories.
“The mood and expectation of those at the conference is that the Republicans will come to power again in the 2010 midterm elections and regain the White House in 2012,” Summers said.
Any prominent members of the GOP were present, including Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and newly inaugurated Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell. Former Vice President Dick Cheney made a surprise appearance during his daughter Liz Cheney’s speech.
Major events included speeches and panel discussions about foreign policy, economic issues, student activism and other topics. Panels titled “Saving Freedom from the Tax Collectors” and “Saving Freedom for Future Generations” featured well-known conservatives like Bob Barr, the 2008 Libertarian presidential candidate, and John Ashcroft, former attorney general for President George W. Bush’s administration. Georgetown University Law Center Professor Viet Dinh participated in a discussion titled “Debate: Does Security Trump Freedom?” and spoke about the balance between the two concepts cited in the title.
The Libertarian movement had a strong presence at the conference with many libertarian groups attending. Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas), a champion of the libertarian movement, gave a speech on Friday to an enthusiastic crowd, according to Summers. In his speech, Paul addressed topics such as individual liberty, foreign policy and the Federal Reserve. He also provided his definition of a conservative.
“[To me] a `conservative’ means to conserve the good parts of America and to conserve our Constitution,” he said.
CPAC is known for the unofficial straw poll of potential presidential candidates taken at the conference each year. Rep. Paul won this year’s poll with 31 percent of support, followed by former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney with 22 percent, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin with 7 percent and Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty with 6 percent, according to The Washington Post.
Fox News host Glenn Beck delivered the keynote speech on Saturday, in which he called for conservatives to ally with each other in ideology and accused conservatives of relying on spending and big government.
“What is it that has caused the problem [in America]? And if you say Obama, it’s too simple of an answer because it’s not Barack Obama,” he said. “I’m so sick of hearing people say `Republicans are going to solve it all.'”
Beck attacked what he referred to as “progressivism” in his speech, and argued against Obama’s economic policies, warning that an “economic holocaust” would soon be on its way.
This year’s CPAC was particularly controversial due to the decision to invite GOPride, a conservative gay rights organization. Some conservative groups boycotted the conference in protest over the presence of GOPride.

*Every member of the Georgetown community knows Jack the Bulldog as our favorite furry mascot and ruthless box-destroyer. But what goes on in Jack’s life behind the scenes? Jonathan Masserano (COL ’10) and Maggie Lonergan (COL ’10) are heads of the Jack Crew – a group of students responsible for walking Jack and escorting him to various events on campus. The Hoya sat down with Jonathan and Maggie to discuss the responsibilities and benefits of being a caretaker for Jack. *
 
**Taking care of the school dog is a big responsibility. How did you get involved? **
 
 
 
aggie: I started [the] summer after my freshman [year]. I was on campus working for housing and I saw that Fr. [Christopher] Steck [S.J.] had put up some flyers about walking Jack for the summer. I’ve always liked dogs, so I thought it would be a fun thing to do.
 
 
 
Jonathan: I just applied through the [Georgetown] Web site. I filled out the application at the end of freshman year and starting walking Jack the fall of my sophomore year.
 
 
 
**How many people make up the Jack Crew?**
 
 
 
: There are 20 walkers, plus us two. There’s also a list of substitute walkers.
 
 
 
**What is the application process for becoming part of the Crew?**
 
 
 
J: There’s an application online – it’s about a semester-long waitlist. The application pretty much just asks how you show school spirit. Then, before you start walking, you have to go through a training session where you sing the fight song for Fr. Steck and show that you’re not afraid to stick your hand in Jack’s mouth. You have to do that to save him in case he starts choking.
 
 
 
: And that’s actually really important, because choking is a common thing [for] bulldogs.
 
 
 
**What is Jack’s typical daily schedule? **
 
 
 
: Sleeping a lot!
 
 
 
J: Yeah, he gets walked a lot, too. He gets walked three times a day by the Jack Crew and at least two times by Fr. Steck.
 
 
 
: We walk him at noon, 4 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., and Fr. Steck walks him to the Jesuit Residence in the morning and again before he goes to sleep.
 
 
 
**Are there any serious or bizarre rules you have to follow as his caretakers?**
 
 
 
: Well, walkers definitely have to show up to walk Jack. It sounds weird because you figure it wouldn’t be that big of a responsibility, but it’s a big deal if walkers don’t show up. He’s very well trained, so he doesn’t go to the bathroom inside or anything. The walks are the only times he gets to go out and they’re about four hours apart. People have actually been kicked off the Jack Crew for not showing up to their walk time.
 
 
 
J: There are certain special rules at events, too.
 
 
 
: Yeah, like don’t feed him.
 
 
 
J: Also, don’t let him attack traffic cones. Jack likes to attack orange traffic cones and do inappropriate things to them, so some people find it entertaining.
 
 
 
**What is the funniest thing Jack has ever done? **
 
 
 
: One time I was walking Jack on Prospect Street by Village A. It was right after a storm and a lot of branches had fallen down. We were on the sidewalk with those little poles along the side. He picked up this tree branch that must have been six feet long and was just walking down and he got stuck at one point, because it wasn’t wide enough to fit the stick through.
 
 
 
J: One day someone was driving a golf cart out of the Jesuit Residence, and he chased after it and jumped in. He’s also really funny in the snow, chasing snowballs and stuff.
 
 
 
**Does Jack have any strange habits, or particular likes or dislikes?**
 
 
 
J: There are the orange cones. He likes those. He hates the flags on Copley Lawn, he barks at them every time we walk by.
 
 
 
: He likes boxes, any kind of boxes.
 
 
 
J: He likes drinking out of water bottles, too. When we are at the games and are trying to get him to look at the camera, you would think we would be holding a treat in front of him or something. But we hold the water bottle.
 
 
 
**What’s your favorite part about taking care of Jack?**
 
 
 
J: I really like getting to go to the basketball games. We get to run out with the team at the beginning, and then the box trick is fun. And also, at halftime we get to take him around the concourse area and fans like to take pictures with him. The little kids are always funny.
 
 
 
: I like overnight dog-sitting. Especially on the weekends, he just runs around the hallways. I’ll play tricks with him on the elevators, going to different floors and stuff. He’s really playful.
 
 
 
**What’s your favorite memory as part of the Crew?**
 
 
 
: Before we were the heads of the Jack Crew, a local news channel was doing a special on Jack. I got to be in charge of driving Jack around campus in the golf cart. That was pretty cool.
 
 
 
J: I always like driving him around in the golf cart, but one time when my family was visiting, all of us got to ride around with him. Everyone was pointing and waving, it was fun. We felt pretty important. Also, when we got to the Duke game this year, Obama’s Secret Service agents were checking out the car, and they were all excited to see Jack. They were like, “Is that the mascot? Wow! We’re checking out the mascot’s car, this is so exciting!” I wish I had a camera.
 
 
 
**How has this role shaped your Georgetown experience as a whole?**
 
 
 
: It’s definitely [been] much busier than I expected.

Philly Pizza & Grill continues to operate and now faces legal action after being issued a “notice to discontinue illegal use of premises” late Friday afternoon, an order that enforces the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs’ revocation of the restaurant’s certificate of occupancy.
“Philly Pizza must immediately cease operation at 1211 Potomac St. NW upon service of this notice,” according to the notice issued by Zoning Administrator Matthew LeGrant and delivered to Philly Pizza shortly after 3 p.m. Friday.
The D.C. Office of the Attorney General filed with the D.C. Superior Court late Monday seeking a temporary restraining order for Philly Pizza, according to Bill Starrels, vice chairman of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission.
A temporary restraining order would command Philly Pizza to refrain from operating following issuance of the notice on Friday. Starrels could not confirm if the Office of the Attorney General is pursuing emergency injunctive relief, a more permanent measure that would subject Mehmet Kocak, owner of Philly Pizza, to more serious civil or criminal penalties for failure to comply.
“Technically as I understand it, [Kocak] doesn’t have a certificate of occupancy to be open,” Starrels said.
Philly Pizza was open for business Monday and Maria Bakina, a Philly Pizza employee, said that it would continue operating on Tuesday.
Kocak declined to comment, referring requests for comment to his lawyer, John Patrick Brown Jr., who could not be reached for comment.
“Personally I have no idea why they are still open,” Starrels said. “We’re just anxious to see this chapter closed.”

With unemployment rates since the beginning of the recession rivaling those of the Great Depression, many in the class of 2010 struggle to find post-graduation employment in the most popular fields, yet the job market has spurred current students and recent graduates alike to pursue creative work alternatives for their time after the Hilltop.
Robert Chedid (MSB ’10), a marketing and finance double major, joins the ranks of many Georgetown students who have yet to solidify their postgraduate plans.
“I’d ideally go into a position that leverages both my marketing and finance skills, something like a marketing consulting position that’s both quantitative and abstract,” Chedid said. “Though I’m sure the economy has affected my job hunt so far, I’m confident I’ll be able to find a job by graduation or shortly thereafter.”
According to the 2009 senior survey published by the Career Education Center, only 57 percent of the Class of 2009 reported being employed after graduation – a 5 percent decrease from the Class of 2008. Kim Keller (MSB ’09), who now works for the Federal Reserve Bank in Philadelphia, is one such student who experienced difficulties seeking employment after graduating last spring.
“I was looking mainly at consulting jobs,” Keller said. “I was a finance and management double major. I wanted to do strategy work, but all the places I applied to weren’t hiring. By the time I took my job I was [going to] take any offer.”
But as the ailing economy exacerbates the job hunt for recent graduates, many have been forced to explore other options, using the skills learned from their majors to find employment.
When Betsy Brown (COL ’08) first enrolled at Georgetown, she was a government major hoping to pursue a career in public policy. Now, she is working in communications and community relations for an international human rights nongovernmental organization in Kenya.
“I became interested in international human rights work during my time at Georgetown, but I didn’t expect to find myself doing this work so early in my career,” Brown said. “However, after working in public affairs consulting for just a year and a half, I decided to take the opportunity to go overseas to do similar communications work for an NGO.”
Brown added that her government major has helped her develop a greater understanding of the world and her career.
“My major was particularly helpful in shaping my understanding of the role and function of governments and nongovernmental organizations in the [United States] and abroad and has enhanced my ability to work within those systems, in both the [United States] and abroad,” Brown said.
While some graduates found their major not only helpful, but essential, others said that their major was not nearly as beneficial as their training in the workplace. Colleen Regan (SFS ’09), who currently works at Credit Suisse in the financial services company’s Prime Services department in New York City, said she didn’t begin thinking about finance until midway through her junior year at Georgetown.
“As a general rule, you learn most of what you do in your job on the job,” Regan said. “Having an economics background is helpful if you work in finance, and I’m glad I majored in international political economy. Very few people I work with were actually finance majors in college – it’s not really necessary.”
Some graduates choose to hold off on finding employment by seeking some form of postgraduate education. Twenty-three percent of the Class of 2009 chose to attend a postgraduate institution, down 1 percent from 2008.
Kathleen Elsener (NHS ’10), a human science major, plans to attend medical school and work in health care as a primary care physician.
“Human science allows students to study the human body at an undergraduate level and has given me opportunities many students first encounter in graduate level education,” Elsener said. “Hopefully this background has prepared me for the rigors of medical school.”
Hector Cendejas (COL ’10), a sociology major with a concentration in social justice analysis, plans to attend law school after taking a gap year.
“Hopefully I can work in a government office, if not do community organizing and fight for justice, but of course, my main goal is law school and [to] become a lawyer in D.C. or [New York],” Cendejas said. “I think my major gives me an opportunity to seek any type of job, whether it’s working with people, law, politics and even business.”
While some students and recent graduates have sought careers that align with their majors, others take an entirely new direction. Yet the question remains: Is there really such a thing as a useless major?
Jake Tuber (COL ’09), who majored in philosophy at Georgetown, is currently a content producer for NBCOlympics.com and works with the network’s local affiliates.
“I was a philosophy major. Directly speaking, there’s almost no correlation between philosophy and anything,” Tuber said. “On a certain level the analytic skills required to complete that major has helped the editing skills for the stuff I do here. It’s forced me to be a very careful reader and writer. It’s forced me to assess things from different angles and appreciate different viewpoints.”
As current seniors seek postgraduate work and underclassmen search for summer internships, Hoyas can take peace of mind in that once they find a job, their Georgetown education will have prepared them well for it.

The application rate for the Georgetown University School of Medicine increased by 7 percent this year, reflective of a national increase in applications to medical and other graduate programs.
For 2010, the number of applicants to the medical school was 11,549, as compared to 10,797 in 2009, according to Brandon Schneider, assistant dean for admissions in the medical school’s office of admissions.
The figures include applicants to all M.D. programs, M.D. and Ph.D dual-degree programs and early assurance candidates, according to Schneider. The entering class size is currently 196 students, the admissions rate being 17 percent. There have been no changes in the requirements for admission, such as MCAT scores or GPAs of accepted students. Georgetown usually interviews about 1,100 to 1,200 applicants of the total application pool, according to Schneider.
Georgetown’s medical students come from 90 to 100 different undergraduate colleges and universities, 30 to 35 states and territories and one to three foreign countries, according to Schneider.
Georgetown is ranked 39th in terms of research-based medical programs, according to US News and World Report. In 2008, it was ranked 44th.
Applications for medical schools rose nationally and in the District in 2010. Howard University College of Medicine’s saw a 3 percent overall rise in applications. In 2009 the total number of applicants was 6,005 and in 2010 it rose to 6,172.
“The rise in application numbers reflects a rise in national application statistics,” Schneider said in an e-mail. “We attribute part of this to more individuals desiring to attend graduate [and] professional schools to improve their credentials in a tight job market.”
A 2008 report from the American Association of Medical Colleges projected a 20 percent increase in medical students in the United States between 2002 and 2013.

University President John J. DeGioia reaffirmed Georgetown’s commitment to sustainable development and operations last week by signing the Sustainable Campus Charter at the 2010 meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
By signing the charter, Georgetown joins a group of 25 universities worldwide, including Brown University and University of Copenhagen, in pledging to support sustainable development practices. The 25 universities, known collectively as the Global University Leadership Forum (GULF), were selected to reflect “ranking, strategic importance of the university [.] and contribution of the leader of the university to the community,” according to the GULF Web site.
“At Georgetown, we’ve made a commitment to minimize our environmental impact, promote energy efficiency and build sustainable practices,” DeGioia said in a university press release. “We are proud to sign on to this charter, and we will continue our efforts to align our operations, research and teaching with the goal of sustainability.”
Participating institutions are encouraged to support environmental and social sustainability on their campuses and serve as pace-setters in their communities. The Sustainable Campus Charter mandates adherence to three campus-wide principles formulated by the International Sustainable Campus Network. The first mandate requires demonstration of sustainable construction, renovation and campus operation. The second calls for sustainable campus planning, development and community integration. Finally, the charter mandates linking facilities, research and education for sustainable development.
“In signing on to this charter, we are affirming the university’s commitment to sustainability.  Georgetown is addressing issues of sustainability in a comprehensive way,” said Andy Pino, the university’s director of media relations.
The sustainable campus practices that have been implemented over the past several years include converting the Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle fleet to biofuel and making improvements to the university recycling program. The university has reduced its carbon footprint by 16 percent over the past three years.
In the near future, sustainability issues are being taken into account in terms of the 2010 Campus Plan, a guide for campus planning and development over the next 10 years. Currently being drafted, the Campus Plan is expected to include methods for introducing sustainable practices related to “recycling, construction and renovation, energy use, transportation, and academic courses,” according to a November 2009 presentation of the draft Campus Plan.
Georgetown’s green efforts have been successful, according to independent sustainability auditing organizations. Georgetown’s grade from the Sustainable Endowments Institute, which compiles an annual “green” ranking of colleges and universities nationwide, was raised from a B- to a B between 2008 and 2009, tying with American University and The George Washington University for the highest grade among District universities.

Two years after the anthropology program separated from the sociology department, plans to solidify the resulting anthropology department’s autonomy continue with a scheduled move from the Intercultural Center to the Car Barn this summer.
In addition to the new office location, the anthropology department now has its own budget and cost center as a result of the split in 2008, according to Susan Terrio, associate professor and chair of the anthropology department. The two programs had shared a budget since the recent change.
“I remember the day when the anthropology department found out about its becoming a separate department,” Bettina Bergöo (COL ’11), an anthropology major, said in an e-mail. “We were having an anthropology open house, and all of the professors who have been working on this initiative for years were overjoyed.”
The anthropology program first proposed independence from the sociology department in 2007, and after a vote by the university’s Board of Directors in 2008, it was granted autonomy.
“Institutionally and in our scholarship, [the anthropology and sociology departments] tend to have gone our separate ways for a century or so,” said Timothy Wickham-Crowley, an associate professor in the sociology department. “Given that, it’s appropriate for us to have different departments.”
Wickham-Crowley added, “I don’t see how this could be anything but good for the students.”
Georgetown College is in the process of implementing guidelines that will allow students to major in either anthropology or sociology and minor in the other.
“I am also happy to report that we continue to attract new, excellent majors and minors and that students from all over the campus – including the School of Foreign Service, [the School of Nursing and Health Studies and the McDonough School of Business] – enroll in the wide variety of electives we offer including courses in elites, gender, globalization, migration, medical anthropology, race in cross-cultural perspective, urban anthropology and work,” Terrio said in an e-mail.
Terrio acknowledged that the department of anthropology is currently small, consisting of 10 anthropologists who, according to the department’s Web site, regularly teach and/or advise undergraduate students pursuing anthropology as a major or a minor. These faculty members, however, work closely with members of other departments as well.
“The anthropology department does feel small to me, and in my opinion that is an advantage more than a negative,” Bergöo said in an e-mail.
While the two departments are formally separated, Bergöo also spoke of the presence of sociology themes in the study of anthropology.
“In the future I personally hope to see the divergence of the two departments foster an attention to applied [and] engaged anthropology whose sociology is embedded in a broader anthropological framework,” Bergöö said in an e-mail. “Fortunately, all of the professors I have had in the department are skilled at incorporating applicable elements of sociology into anthropological theory, which makes me as an anthropology major feel like I have the best of both worlds.”

Hillary Dang (SFS ’12) and Katie Balloch (COL ’12) walked between the treadmills and stationary bicycles in Yates Field House to distribute bottles of Gatorade, while Matt Wagner (SFS ’11) and Emmanuel Hampton (COL ’11) knocked on every door of all the freshman dorms on campus, and then some. Calen Angert (MSB ’11) and Jason Kluger (MSB ’11) set up a table outside of Midnight Mug, and Arman Ismail (COL ’11) and Tucker Stafford (COL ’12) caught up with diners in O’Donovan Hall.
 
As the eight students vying in today’s election to head the Georgetown University Student Association Executive make clear, winning votes is not just about posting fliers or creating YouTube videos, but rather making unique efforts to reach out to the student body that they hope to represent next year.
 
The general consensus of all the candidates this year is that face time with voters is their first priority.
 
“Calen and I try to talk to as many people as possible – that’s our focus. We look for the opportunity to talk to fellow students about our ideas for next year and all that we can do for them,” Kluger said in an e-mail.
 
Ismail agreed: “For us, the best strategy has always been simply talking to and hearing the needs and ideas of students,” he said.
 
According to Wagner, the most difficult problem that he and Hampton have encountered in their campaigning is trying to lobby those who are relatively indifferent to the primary campaign issues.
 
“The difficult part is apathy, but the best part is seeing people care about the things that are going to affect the whole campus. We have seen that a lot,” he said.
 
While all of the candidates have utilized technology such as personalized Web sites, Facebook groups and YouTube videos to broadcast their stances on the issues, Dang asserts that it is only a starting point.
“Face-to-face time is a lot more beneficial because you’re actually interacting with who you’re trying to reach,” Dang said.
“We were never concerned with things like the number of people joining a Facebook group, but rather we focused on the ideas we heard and shared and the amount of support we gained through personal interactions,” Ismail and Stafford said in an e-mail.
 
Dang and Balloch said that they have targeted underclassmen especially in the past week.
“While it’s important to reach out to juniors and seniors, we both think it is important to reach out to freshmen. If they make the change and become more aware, they can get more involved [in the future],” Balloch said.
Wagner and Hampton said that they are targeting the groups on campus that have been underrepresented in the past, including the arts community and minority activism groups.
Through interactions with students, each team has had the opportunity to convey what they believe to be the most important issues for GUSA to address and why they are fit for the task.
 
Angert points to his experience as the sitting GUSA president as testimony.
“I think we are in the best position to expand on the ideas already in place,” Angert said. “Our lead time is nothing. On Wednesday, I can meet with everybody and get started. There is no hitch in the system. I think that is very critical.”
 
The other pairs acknowledge the challenges that come with running against the incumbent. Wagner, however, sees the circumstances as an opportunity.
 
“While it is difficult to run against people with the name recognition among upperclassmen and a record of some good things to run on, I think it’s a two-sided issue,” Wagner said. “We don’t need to say that they won’t do well on certain issues – we can say that they haven’t done well on certain issues.”
 
Wagner said that he and Hampton do a better job of representing the needs and wants of the entire student body.
Dang and Balloch believe being the only all-female ticket in the race enables them to relate to a wider audience.
“I think as `Jane Hoyas’ instead of the typical `Joe Hoya’ presidential candidates we hope to actually make the change from the old GUSA to the new one. We keep saying in our campaign that we want to bring a fresh approach to GUSA, and we think as the only female candidates and first all-female ticket we actually achieve that,” Dang and Balloch said in an e-mail. “There are only nine girls in GUSA currently out of the 42 [senate and Executive] seats. That ratio doesn’t seem quite right at a school where 55 [percent] of the student body is female.”
Ismail and Stafford are also approaching the campaign from the perspective of an unconventional pair – Ismail is a GUSA senator and Stafford is a two-sport varsity athlete – but they said that they are able to balance each other out and, coming from diverse interests, are able to better serve the community.
 
By combining individual strengths, the other candidates have also been able to create a unique synergy within their teams.
“We’re similar in the sense that we have similar priorities, but we’re different in the sense that we bring different strengths to GUSA,” Wagner said of the dynamic between himself and Hampton. “He has an unending diligence to what he does, whereas I am more like an ideas person. He is too, but he is more of a `Let’s put this into action’ kind of person. We work incredibly well together.”
Angert referred to a similar team-oriented relationship with Kluger.
“I can definitely depend on him to give any project due diligence, and I would expect he would say the same about me. After having worked this long together, we’ve come to appreciate each other’s approach and have capitalized on our different strengths,” Angert said.
The vigorous campaigning and, in the case of Angert and Kluger, the past work for the GUSA Executive, take a toll on the candidates.
“It gets busy, it gets stressful. But if you truly enjoy it, it’s not bad. And we truly enjoy it – walking into a room of 20 people, our executive, and saying `Alright, what can we do to make this place better?'” Angert said.
 
Kluger credited the positive feedback and assistance they have received from their supporters in their campaign efforts.
“This year, it’s still hectic, but we are extremely fortunate in that we have a large number of tremendous people who are dedicated to improving the lives of the student body. As a result, we have been able to reach out to a far greater number of people than last year,” Kluger said.
For Ismail and Stafford, the biggest challenge has been “balancing the time that an endeavor of this nature requires with other aspects of our lives such as schoolwork,” they said.
While the work is difficult and time-consuming at times, Wagner refers to his motivation to serve the campus community.
“When people ask why something is important to us, it’s because it is important to us, it’s not because it’s something we collected opinions [on] and decided it’s the most important thing to run on. We’re doing things because we believe in them, and we want that to come across when we campaign,” Wagner said.
While the candidates diverge in their views of the issues, they can all agree that they are looking for students to go online and vote today.
“We hope students will take note and involve themselves. It’s not hard to get involved. Regardless of the election, we hope we made a difference in some way,” Dang said.

Anthony Lake, distinguished professor in practice of diplomacy in the School of Foreign Service, was nominated last week to be the next head of UNICEF.
The news of Lake’s nomination came in a letter written by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice and shared with the Associated Press. Rice listed Lake’s qualifications for the position as “extraordinary experience, strategic vision and energy to UNICEF’s essential work.” She also stressed Lake’s commitment to the values central to UNICEF’s mission, including children’s rights, protection and education.
“[His] global reputation as person of unsurpassed intelligence and uncommon decency will elevate the image of UNICEF. That he is so highly regarded by President Obama and so many leaders in the U.S. Congress will further strengthen UNICEF’s long-term mission,” said Thomas Melia, director of research at the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy.
Lake has served on the board of directors of the U.S. Fund for UNICEF for nine years, including one term as chair from 2004 to 2007. He is now a permanent honorary member of the board.
Sam Dulik (SFS ’13), a student in Lake’s proseminar last semester and a columnist for THE HOYA, credits Lake’s nomination to more than his résumé.
“His passionate commitment to human rights, from Bosnia to Africa to nuclear weapons elimination, equips him with the credentials to make a phenomenal leader of UNICEF,” Dulik said. “[Lake] is the unique public servant who has a great brain and a greater heart.”
According to AP, Rice gave several examples of Lake’s humanitarian work in her letter, such as roles he has held as chair of the Marshall Legacy Institute, an organization that aims to eliminate land mines, director of International Voluntary Services, a non-governmental organization that coordinates short-term and long-term volunteer work, a member of the U.N. Panel of High-Level Personalities on African Development and a board member for both Save the Children and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
“It seemed that every other weekend he was off in Haiti or Sarajevo doing humanitarian work,” said another of Lake’s students, Sean Kelly (SFS ’13). “I always saw Lake as an unbelievably kind, open and generous man.”
Renata Moniaga (SFS ’11), president of the Georgetown chapter of UNICEF, agrees that Lake is a good candidate for the position.
“I think it’s great that [Lake] is being considered for the position. He’s had a long and respected presence in the international development field,” Moniaga said. “Even on campus, he’s been very supportive of the UNICEF cause and has always been willing to help our group whenever he can.”
Lake will not be officially appointed to the position of executive director of UNICEF until April 30, when current Executive Director Ann Venemen’s five-year term expires. UNICEF has traditionally appointed an American as its leader, since the United States contributes more to the organization than any of the other 190 countries in which it operates.
Dulik and Kelly both agree that when Lake is appointed, Georgetown will lose an extremely valuable professor. Lake has taught at Georgetown since 1997.
“His nomination to UNICEF only confirms his importance in the role of international development,” Kelly said. “It makes me feel incredibly fortunate and proud to have been taught by such a remarkable man.”
Lake’s work with UNICEF comprises only a part of his foreign policy experience. From 1993 to 1997, Lake served as National Security Advisor to President Clinton. He was also director of policy planning for President Carter from 1977 to 1981, White House special envoy from 1998 to 2000 and a foreign policy adviser to President Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
Lake began his career in the U.S. Foreign Service in 1962, serving as a foreign service officer until 1970. In 1969, he accompanied President Nixon’s National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger to an early secret meeting with North Vietnamese negotiators in Paris.

In a lecture in Gaston Hall yesterday, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen reflected on NATO’s current role in today’s globalized society and how the organization will continue to evolve in the future.
Rasmussen and Madeleine Albright, former secretary of state and Mortara distinguished professor of diplomacy in the School of Foreign Service, spoke to the Georgetown community at an event titled “NATO – Delivering Real Security in an Age of Uncertainty,” co-sponsored by Georgetown University and The Center for a New American Security.
Rasmussen, dubbed “NATO’s Reformer” by Time, discussed the purpose of NATO in the post-Cold War world and outlined his idea for the future of the organization. He stressed the importance of multilateral cooperation among member NATO countries.
“If you want to be secure in a world of global risks and threats, like-minded and democratic nations need to cooperate,” Rasmussen said.
He cited the war in Afghanistan as the prime example of the cooperation that exists among NATO member states. He reminded attendees that as President Obama announced a troop increase, 35 other countries also announced a troop increase.
“NATO is and will remain the gold standard for military cooperation for this country and all the allies,” Rasmussen said.
Rasmussen also addressed the recent NATO air raid in Afghanistan, in which 27 civilians died.
“I just spoke to President [Hamid] Karzai [of Afghanistan] and expressed a deep regret and condolences for the latest [incident] where Afghan civilians have lost their lives,” Rasmussen said. “We have to continue our efforts to minimize civilian casualties. . I don’t think you can be too careful. Every life lost is one life too much.”
According to Rasmussen, NATO is the trusted framework through which nations with similar notions of freedom, individual liberty and religious tolerance along with interconnected economies are able to come together to preserve their identities. “Today more than ever, when you are looking for security in an age of uncertainty, it is precious. You can find it in NATO today, and you will be able to rely on NATO tomorrow as well,” Rasmussen said.
Aside from discussing the ways in which NATO has succeeded in its mission, Rasmussen introduced Albright, chair of the Group of Experts for NATO’s New Strategic Concept, who was appointed to explore ways for the organization to continue to develop. “[NATO’s] continued effectiveness should be a matter of urgent concern to us all,” Albright said.
Rasmussen added, “The development of the New Strategic Concept is the most open and inclusive process ever in the history of the alliance.”
The process encourages input from non-experts, such as Georgetown students.
“I would encourage you to take a moment to go to the NATO Web model on the strategic concept. Have a look and let us know what you think,” Rasmussen said. “And let me assure you, we really do look at [the comments].”
The event did not proceed without protest. Before the event, several protesters handed out falsified programs critical of NATO.
“The list of NATO war crimes is long and will continue to grow as long as the organization continues to operate without a clear mandate, justifying its militarily aggressive actions by professing an adherence to human rights,” the fake program read.
