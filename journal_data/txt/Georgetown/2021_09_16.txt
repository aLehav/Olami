As the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service fellows prepare to launch the first in-person discussion groups in over a year, the cohort sat down with The Hoya to discuss their goals for the upcoming semester.
The fall 2021 cohort includes Brian Stelter, CNN chief media correspondent, Charlotte Clymer (COL ’16), the Human Rights Campaign’s former press secretary for rapid response and the first openly transgender GU Politics fellow. The group also includes Rory Cooper, partner at Purple Strategies, a political reputation management firm; Ambassador Bob Lighthizer (CAS ’69, LAW ’73), former U.S. trade representative; Amna Nawaz, chief correspondent for PBS NewsHour; and Rebecca Pearcey, Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-Mass.) political director and senior adviser. 
The group marks the 13th class of fellows to come to the Hilltop. Launched in 2015, the fellows program brings influential political figures to campus to exchange ideas and analysis with students. Fellows host weekly discussion groups focused on current political issues as well as office hours with students, held in person for the first time since spring 2020.
The following has been edited for length and clarity.
Could you tell us briefly what your plans are for your discussion groups and what you hope students can take away from them?
Clymer: I’m doing advocacy communications for the semester, and what I really want to do is make a space where folks can talk honestly about really tough topics, especially as they relate to advocacy. So for example, we’ll be doing a whole discussion on LGBTQ rights, specifically trans rights. We’ll be doing one on police brutality and white supremacy, the defund the police conversation. We’ll be doing one on how to talk to media to pursue your advocacy goals. But beyond that, it would be really great to have a philosophical discussion on things that folks generally avoid talking about in polite company.
Nawaz: I’m focusing on representation in halls of power and focusing mostly on media. A lot of the conversations we are gonna have are going to focus on who’s at the table, who’s in the room, you know, whose voices are elevated and whose aren’t and how those decisions are made and then also how that impacts what stories get told — so specific to political journalism, the impact it has on the politics that affect all of us in our everyday lives and connecting the media to the politics but really through a lens of power and who’s at the table.
Lighthizer: It’ll surprise you to know that I’m going to talk about trade — international trade specifically — and what kind of a trade policy we should have in the United States and what our objectives should be, and then I want to talk about it in specific discussion groups as it relates to specific countries … So, I mean, those are the issues, the major international trade issues and how we ought to be rethinking about them.
Stelter: My program on CNN is about media, about what’s right and what’s wrong in the media, so my discussion groups are going to be called “Press and Propaganda: Real News, Fake News and Everything in Between.” And I’m really interested in the “in between” part of that. There’s a wide spectrum of news coverage in the U.S. and some of it is prestige, high-quality, fact-checked, rigorous stuff, and then there’s obviously trash and truly fake news and nonsense out there. There’s a lot in between, and so there’s a wide range to talk about, I think, when it comes to what is the role of the press corps? What is the role of the press corps in responding to outright propaganda, and how do we know what’s in between? And I’m hoping to do that in a constructive way, not a destructive way. So much media criticism these days is destructive; it is designed to sow doubt and disturb distrust and sow hatred of the media. What’s much more valuable is to be constructive and talk about ways to fix what’s broken, so that’s what I hope to do.
Pearcey: I will be talking about the nexus between political campaigns and the policies the candidates put forward but how those policies actually get into government offices and then enacted into law. Beyond that, we will talk about some of the political movements over the last 20 years, not going as back as civil rights, but maybe Occupy Wall Street or — I forget some of the other ones that are maybe on there — but so it will be more of a campaign-side view of what goes on, on the political end.
Cooper: I am going to be focusing on different reforms that can help government possibly perform better or could also negatively impact it. I think that the students here at Georgetown are going to be the ones over the next 10 or 20 years who are determining what and how government operates, and what I’m excited to do is to learn their thoughts on the positives and negatives of certain reforms, like increasing the size of the House, adding states to the country, ending the filibuster, adding seats to the Supreme Court and other reforms like that — and really explore and help them understand and help myself understand how some of these could help politics and public service work better for Americans.
What advice would you give from your career experience to a Georgetown student participating in your programming? 
Clymer: My biggest piece of advice hands down is make sure you develop your relationships both personally and professionally. Personally, you should have a support network that you can go back to on really tough days, friends and family that you take care of and that take care of you. Professionally, talk to as many people as you can, learning more about who is in your industry, who is in your general professional world and learning how to work with them toward the goals you have. 
Nawaz: I tell young journalists that the one thing you have to maintain is your curiosity. The moment you’ve made up your mind about the things you cover, you should stop covering that issue. That’s specific to journalists. The best piece of advice I ever got early in my career was the two things you control and you can never lose and once you’ve lost either of them you’re done are your reputation and relationships. That’s regardless of whatever field you go into. You build those the moment you start working with your classmates, start working on projects together, have your first internship. Those will stay with you every step of the way throughout your career.
Stelter: You know when you see those scrums at a press conference, where there’s 40 reporters there all trying to get the same soundbyte? We all have to do that assignment someday, sometimes we all have to do that job. But it’s not very satisfying; you’re not going to get anything original in that scrum of 100 cameras. In fact, you’re probably just going to get trampled. It’s so much more interesting to be the one person across campus doing something entirely different from what that scrum is doing. It’s so much more satisfying to figure out what is going to be news a month from now rather than following up on what was news yesterday. It’s that mindset of figuring out what you can break or what is going to be news as opposed to what everyone else is doing. That’s one of the only ways to stand out in the profession — to try and figure out what the next story is, not just following up on what everyone else is doing.
Pearcey: I actually think that when people come and ask me how I got to where I am, they’re looking for a very linear answer, that it is, “You do this, then you do that, then you go here.” I think in politics, it’s really a “choose your own adventure.” You can get to wherever you want to go, you just have to make decisions and keep moving forward and not get too hung up on “What’s my next move?” I like to ask people, “What do you want to learn next? What do you want to be doing next?” Then, if you’re still pressing me for the next move, it’s about two steps from now but not a massive 10-year plan where you plan the next presidential race. It’s about what you want to learn, what you want to be doing, and then figuring it out.
Cooper: You can have a lot of bad jobs. Every job doesn’t have to be perfect. And you don’t have to settle on exactly what you’re going to be for the rest of your life the second you enter your career. I think relationships and knowledge are your power in this industry. Being smart about the issues and the process and the people involved will help you move ahead. And sometimes it’s not necessarily having the knowledge but being the quickest one to attain it. Things move rapidly in politics, and you need to be flexible and you need to have a thick skin and you need to be able to move fast. And if you can think through problems with those attributes in mind, you’ll do okay.
American political discourse can be very polar. How do you plan to facilitate dialogue with students from across the political spectrum?
Clymer: I would love to emphasize to students to get back to facts — not compelling opinions, not things that sound good in your head or sound good when someone says them compellingly, but actual numbers, figures, things that make sense. You can have someone who’s really smart and makes a compelling case, but it’s not based on much. I think we see that a lot now in politics, across the spectrum, and certainly with progressives. I’ve seen progressives say some things that were completely dead wrong, but they said it in compelling ways, and people love it. That doesn’t help with discourse at all. We really need to get back to adult conversations with facts and evidence. 
Nawaz: Facts, not feelings. There is sort of an assumption of good faith. If you are here and participating in these conversations, I will assume you’re here with good intentions and you want to learn and you have some basic level of curiosity and you think you might be wrong about some things. Those are all really good starting points to have a thoughtful discussion. That’s the way I practice journalism most of the time, but it’s key to these discussions too. It’s an intention of good faith; we think you’re here because you want to learn, and we’re going to learn with you, and we don’t have all the answers. At all of the discussion groups, we have questions we want answers to that we hope will come in the discussion groups.
Stelter: Yes, there are students of all ages, but we’re talking largely about young people. And young people should recognize they have more in common than they have apart. There’s a lot to fix. It’s going to fall on the shoulders of young people whether they vote one way or another. I hope that’s a common ground to find here.Cooper: My discussion groups are going to be about issues that are complex and don’t have an easy answer and that there are positives and negatives on both sides of the equation. The students will have to evaluate those for themselves and for the larger political context. I don’t see there being much friction in that, but I may be surprised.

Georgetown University urged community members to take precautions against potential network breaches Sept. 9 after Howard University fell victim to a ransomware cyberattack that forced the college to suspend all classes for four days.
A ransomware cyberattack struck the Howard network Sept. 3, disrupting the university’s systems and forcing its information technology team to take the systems offline to address the attack. In response to the hack, Georgetown University and the FBI provided assistance to Howard’s IT department.
While Howard was able to restore some services, like its WiFi, and resume instruction, the ransomware attack remains an ongoing threat, according to a Howard University spokesperson.
“Our IT team continues to work diligently, night and day, to bring our systems back online, and as a result, WiFi has been restored across campus, face-to-face classes resumed on September 8th, and online class instruction resumed as of September 13,” a Howard University spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We have a long road ahead, and a dedicated team of professionals continue to monitor the situation and address outstanding issues as they are identified.”
Before the attack, Howard students were required to use two-factor authentication any time they log in to access university servers. After the hack, Howard also announced new password requirements for students and faculty Sept. 13 after the attack. Georgetown has enacted similar rules for students in the past, including requiring community members to update their passwords June 1.
While Georgetown was not the victim of a cyberattack, the university has taken additional precautions to protect the university against a similar attack, according to Judd Nicholson, Georgetown vice president for information technology and chief information officer.
“UIS has taken a number of steps to prevent such attacks against the Georgetown network, including increased network monitoring,” Nicholson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Because of security concerns, we do not release specific details about these precautions.”
Ransomware attacks in Washington, D.C., have increased in recent years. In 2016, Georgetown MedStar Hospital was the victim of a cyberattack on patient records and email databases. In May 2021, the Metropolitan Police Department suffered a cyberattack by a Russian ransomware syndicate. In both attacks, hackers demanded monetary compensation to restore the operating systems; however, neither victim paid the ransom.
The motive behind the Howard attack is unclear, according to Clare Sullivan, visiting professor at the Georgetown University Law Center and executive director of the Cyber SMART Research Center, a collaborative technology research firm at Georgetown University.
“Usually money is demanded and economic advantage is often the motivation,” Sullivan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “However, there can be other motives such as to cause damage or to show power. The latter are more likely to be motivated by a grievance, sometimes by a disgruntled applicant or student or employee; or by someone just wanting to cause disruption and observe the ensuing chaos.”
If Howard is blackmailed for monetary compensation, administrators will have to make a difficult decision, according to Eric Burger, a Georgetown computer science research professor and member of Cyber SMART.
“They’re going to set the price such that Howard can pay,” Burger said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “If they say half a million dollars, or $100,000, then Howard is in a really tough spot: Are we going to spend a week rebuilding our systems or are we going to pay?” 
Though there is no evidence any personal information was stolen during the attack, Howard considers the hack an ongoing threat and will continue to work with the FBI to restore the university’s system capacities, according to a Howard University spokesperson.
While ransomware attacks may happen again in the future, practicing individual cyber safety remains the best way to combat potential threats, according to Sullivan.
“Always keep in mind that your personal information, particularly your identity information, is valuable, dont disclose it unless you know to whom you are disclosing it, how your information will be used, and how it will be protected,” Sullivan wrote.

When Sophie Bennett (COL ’23) woke up with a sore throat, she immediately set out to get a COVID-19 test.
Bennett chose to stay home and seek out tests for additional illnesses while awaiting her COVID-19 test results. 
“I decided not to go to classes because I realized that I had been in contact with a friend that has the flu and that could be a possible reason for my sore throat rather than the common cold,” Bennett said in an interview with The Hoya. 
According to Bennett, the Student Health Center (SHC) turned her away for testing when she reported that she did not have a fever. 
“After following up with one of the doctors at the Student Health Center, it was advised that I stay home, get rest and not go to classes but not go to get tested for the flu just because they are focusing on patients who are more sick right now,” Bennett said. 
Now, Bennett has a negative COVID-19 test but is still unclear on why she is feeling sick.
Amid increased health anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, students are now occupied with a new concern: the flu. As of Sept. 13, Georgetown University has recorded 65 confirmed cases of Influenza A on the main campus and at the Medical Center, according to Dr. Ranit Mishori (MED ’02). Amid the spread of this strain, students reported facing barriers to flu testing and treatment at the SHC.
Positive cases can be attributed to the social behaviors of a college campus, according to Mishori. 
“It is unusual for the flu to spread so early in the season,” Mishori wrote in an email to The Hoya. “But the close proximity, density, and social behaviors of people in college settings are the perfect facilitators for influenza (or any other infectious disease) to spread.” 
The university has announced free flu vaccine clinics Sept. 19 and Sept. 23 for undergraduate students, according to a Sept. 16 email from Mishori to the Georgetown community. The university will also host a communitywide flu vaccination clinic in October. 
Dilara Kamrava (COL ’23) expressed similar concerns about the inaccessibility of the SHC. 
“I started having some really severe flu symptoms, got tested for COVID the same day and was negative,” Kamrava wrote in a GroupMe message to The Hoya. “I tried going through the Health Center to get tested for flu, but they don’t take walk-ins and didn’t have an appointment for the next 10 days.” 
Kamrava said she eventually scheduled a test through the One Medical app, a primary care provider available to Georgetown community members. As a result, Kamrava said she took a flu test off campus.
When asked about the university’s strategies to contain the influenza outbreak, a university spokesperson redirected The Hoya to a Sept. 10 email from Mishori. 
Viha Vishwanathan (MSB ’24) said she was able to successfully schedule a test through the SHC while experiencing flu-like symptoms. 
“It was difficult to schedule an appointment by calling the office, since I called a few times and no one answered the phone,” Vishwanathan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I am not sure if this was a connectivity issue, or if the office was backlogged. I went to the office to schedule an appointment, and they were able to give me an appointment for the next day.” 
While students who test positive for the flu or come in close contact with an individual who has tested positive are not required to isolate or quarantine, they should limit in-person activities and wear a mask when around others, according to Mishori. 
“You should stay home and wear a mask around others if you’ve been infected or have symptoms that can be related to the flu or COVID-19,” Mishori wrote.

The long-awaited Georgetown Metro station may finally become a reality after the results of a recent Washington, D.C. transportation study. 
The results of the Blue/Orange/Silver Capacity and Reliability Study, launched in 2019, suggest that the addition of a new Blue line to National Harbor, complete with a tunnel under the Potomac River and a new Metro station in the Georgetown neighborhood may alleviate current traffic issues in the Rosslyn Metro station.  
These results were discussed Sept. 9 by the Finance and Capital Committee of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). The study aimed to identify and evaluate solutions for transportation challenges in the D.C.-Maryland-Virginia area related to reliability, crowding, cost efficiency and long-term sustainability, according to the report. 
Community members have expressed excitement about the proposed transportation possibilities, according to Rick Murphy, chairperson of Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E.
“I don’t think there’s any doubt that the neighborhood would love to have a Metro stop as it’s always been a problem for us,” Murphy said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “If you stand in the middle of Georgetown, you’re almost exactly nine-tenths of a mile from three stops, and nine-tenths of a mile is a little bit too far to walk for a lot of people.”
WMATA has been hesitant to build a station in the Georgetown neighborhood because of the difficulty of underground construction on a steep grade. Further, the tunnel would have been too steep or too deep to justify the cost. 
Currently, WMATA buses connect the residents of Georgetown to surrounding Metro stations. WMATA hosts the free Georgetown circulator, as well as the G2 bus (P Street-LeDroit Park Line).While community members expressed concerns about proposed cuts to the G2 service in March, $1.4 billion from the American Rescue Plan allowed WMATA to avoid such service cuts. 
While proposals and alternatives are being considered for future Metro projects, it is important to ensure that other transportation options continue, according to a spokesperson for Ward 2 Councilmember Brooke Pinto (LAW ’17). 
“Improving affordable, environmentally friendly, and accessible connectivity in Georgetown and throughout our city is a top priority for Councilmember Pinto,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Building a new Metro line to form a Blue line to National Harbor would add 180,000 new week daytrips and would cost between $20 billion and $25 billion to construct, according to the study. WMATA receives over half of its funding from federal grants, while taking the rest of its revenue from ridership. Now that the study is completed, administrators can pursue federal funding for the project, according to the report.
The WMATA board of directors has yet to choose which alternative it will pursue, and federal approval and public suggestions are still needed before any decision is made, according to Sherri Li, WMATA media relations manager.
“This is part of the process to advance a regional solution consistent with federal guidelines,” Li wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Metro staff provided an update on the study’s progress to the Board of Directors last week, which will be followed by extensive outreach to the public, stakeholders, and elected officials that will inform the Board’s consideration and selection of the region’s locally preferred alternative.”
In the meantime, the District is considering other transportation possibilities, such as the Georgetown-Rosslyn Gondola or an electric vehicle charging hub, a project supported by Pinto.
Although adding a Metro station in Georgetown would be a long and expensive endeavor, now is the time to pursue the project on behalf of the community, according to Murphy.
“This is the time when people begin to build momentum for something like this, because for the first time in a very long time, there’s federal money for doing things like this,” Murphy said.

CW: This article discusses clerical sexual abuse on campus. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
More survivors have come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against former Georgetown University Provost J. Donald Freeze, S.J.  
In June, the university rescinded all honorifics from Freeze after a former undergraduate student contacted the university alleging that Freeze forced him to engage in nonconsensual kissing and touching. The university announced on its Title IX page that an undisclosed number of Georgetown graduates have since brought forth similar allegations against the former provost. 
Freeze worked at Georgetown from 1971 to 1991, serving as assistant dean before becoming provost in 1979. 
After the June announcement, University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) formed a working group of the university board of directors specifically dedicated to investigating clerical sexual abuse on campus. The board is led by DeGioia and staffed by three Georgetown graduates. 
On Sept. 11, The Washington Post reported that one of the additional graduates had come forward to them. The survivor said that Freeze “reached over and placed his hand” on the survivor’s crotch during a private dinner. The survivor subsequently attempted to report the incident to the university president at the time, Fr. Timothy Healy, S.J., but the office of the president referred him to campus ministry, The Post reported.
After attempting to reach university officials again in February 2020 and being redirected to the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action, the survivor met virtually with the working group of the board of directors. He told The Post that the working group would not disclose the number of additional survivors who had brought forth allegations against Freeze and instead read him a “written statement of apology.”
Freeze is the 16th publicly known Georgetown-affiliated priest or nun accused of sexual abuse. Prior to rescinding all honorifics from Freeze, administrators also revoked an honorary degree from former Washington, D.C. Archbishop Theodore McCarrick in February 2019 amid allegations of sexual misconduct and student advocacy calling on the university to take action. In August, McCarrick became the first cardinal in the United States to be criminally charged with a sexual offense against a minor. In March 2019, administrators also revoked emeritus status from Fr. Daniel C. O’Connell, S.J., just eight days after receiving questions from The Hoya about past allegations of sexual abuse against him.
A university spokesperson said the university is working with the USA East Province of the Society of Jesus, an organization that assigns Jesuits to Georgetown and other East Coast schools, to address the clerical sexual abuse crisis.
“We have engaged with the USA East Province, which has now committed to readdress and strengthen its policies and processes for sexual misconduct perpetrated against adults, and to more fully share with Georgetown information regarding sexual misconduct of any kind,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Resources: On-campus resources include Health Education Services (202-687-8949) and Counseling and Psychiatric Service (202-687-7080); additional off-campus resources include the D.C. Rape Crisis Center (202-333-7273) and the D.C. Forensic Nurse Examiner Washington Hospital Center (844-443-5732). Individuals can also report sexual misconduct by a Jesuit by contacting the province’s victim advocate at [email protected]. If you or anyone you know would like to receive a sexual assault forensic examination or other medical care — including emergency contraception — call the Network for Victim Recovery of D.C. at 202-742-1727. To report sexual misconduct, you can contact Georgetown’s Title IX coordinator at 202-687-9183 or file an online report here. Emergency contraception is available at the CVS located at 1403 Wisconsin Ave NW and through H*yas for Choice. For more information, visit sexualassault.georgetown.edu.
