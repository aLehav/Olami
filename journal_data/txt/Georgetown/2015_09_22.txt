President Barack Obama presented an updated College Scorecard, a system that informs prospective students about college affordability and graduate workforce participation, with Georgetown displaying above-average rates in these major categories, during his weekly address to the country Sept. 12.
The updated scorecards, revealed on the Department of Education’s website, include information about the earnings, debt and loan payments of each school’s graduates. The first scorecard system was announced in President Obama’s 2013 State of the Union address.
The College Scorecard website presents a general overview of each university’s statistics, ranging from SAT scores to retention rates. Data from more than 7,000 colleges was analyzed for the new database.
The three most prominent statistics are average annual cost, graduation rate and salary 10 years after attendance, measured among students who receive federal aid for tuition. For Georgetown, these numbers are $27,801, 93 percent and $83,300, respectively, which represent above-average rates in all three categories.
Georgetown Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh praised the scorecard’s transparency, in regard to Georgetown information, that could aid applicants in making their decision about which college to attend.
“The scorecard is a reflection of two critical areas related to higher education that Georgetown is constantly working on: access and affordability,” Pugh wrote. “Georgetown is among the top of a list of highly selective and competitive schools [in this regard].”
In his address, Obama said that his administration was compelled to provide more data about colleges to potential applicants, which will increase transparency in the college ratings system.
“Everyone should be able to find clear, reliable, open data on college affordability and value,” Obama said. “Many existing college rankings award schools for spending more money and rejecting more students. … That doesn’t make sense. It has to change.”
Obama argued that access to information about education matters in today’s global society. He said that the United States needs an educated workforce to compete with other countries and that scorecards can help further that goal.
“The country with the best educated workforce in the world is going to win the 21st-century economy,” Obama said. “I want that to be America.”
Originally, the system was intended to rank each university, providing definitive federal rankings based on college affordability information.
However, the originally planned rankings system was changed to a more streamlined format that now simply presents data for viewers, allowing them to compare universities themselves.
“We had a number of concerns about the [original] ratings system because you can’t capture everything in statistics,” Georgetown’s Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming said. “That was a debate that went on for several years.”
Fleming said the president’s administration and the Department of Education had worked closely with Georgetown as well as other schools on the original design, which led them to change their minds about rating schools and instead simply offer statistics.
“We submitted comments to the Department [of Education] as they were working on the ratings system,” Fleming said. “I think there’s little doubt that all of the input that went into the ratings system had an impact on shaping the scorecard.”
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon said the data does not represent the entire Georgetown student body. Only those who utilize federal aid such as Pell Grants to attend Georgetown are accounted for in the statistics. Students who do not receive these benefits are not included in the different categories outlined in the scorecard.
“From the point of view of how do our graduates do, at least financially, it’s good,” Deacon said. “[Just] understand that the particular number is calculated from data that probably represents the lower half of our student body socioeconomically.”
According to Deacon, the data can help aspiring college students who want to avoid debt.
“The benefit for the middle-lower income student coming to Georgetown is [that it’s] likely to pay off on a better salary or better job prospects,” Deacon said. “If that’s what they want.”
Pugh added that university officials, in conjunction with the Department of Education, can customize the scorecard.
“[W]e were not asked to comment on the final configuration released this past weekend,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is encouraging that the Department of Education intends to allow institutions to work to customize their profiles, though the details of that process have not been laid out.”
Fleming said that a scorecard is preferable to a ranking system, but neither can completely capture what happens to each student at Georgetown on a personal level. He said he is unsure that the scorecard’s main features, such as median income years after graduation, tell the whole story about Georgetown graduates.
“Georgetown is proud of the fact that we are educating men and women for others, which means a good number of Georgetown alumni and graduates go on to the Peace Corps, Teach for America, [the] Jesuit Volunteer Service, things of that sort,” Fleming said. “That can’t be reflected in a simple dollars and cents chart.”
Deacon said that Georgetown would use the data for its own fundraising purposes.
“I think that what we will probably do … is use that [data] with our alumni and say things that we’re doing to support the lower income students, that we do have payoff with good results,” Deacon said.
“Therefore, the more you can give us [in money and] scholarships, the better the results.”

The panda cub at the National Zoo, who celebrates his one-month birthday today, has grown to more than two pounds and is in good health, on track to be named and revealed to the public in January.
The baby panda was born with a twin Aug. 22. However, the twin, born with respiratory problems, died five days after its birth, despite attempts by handlers to save it. The official cause of death has yet to be determined by the National Zoo.
Pandas are an endangered species, the rarest in the bear family, with only around 1,800 left in the wild.
The surviving cub is slightly over one kilogram, according to a weighing last Thursday.
“He is doing great,” Nicole MacCorkle, a giant panda keeper at the National Zoo, said. “That’s actually a little bit larger than expected, which is a good thing.”
The cub has begun to grow fur, and typical panda markings have started to appear. According to zoo officials, he already exhibits traits resembling both his mother, Mei Xiang, and father, Tian Tian. The next stage in the baby’s development will be the opening of his eyes and ears, which is expected in less than a month’s time.
“He is [growing hair] and his markings are coming in fairly clearly now so he now looks like a little panda,” MacCorkle said. “Things are going to progress pretty quickly.”
At the moment, the baby is trying to push upward with his front legs to get his weight underneath his body, which will allow him to walk.
After the cub begins to become more independent, Mei Xiang will leave the den for more extended periods of time to ease herself back into her old schedule.
“They’re very different creatures, but the mother has to get her schedule in sync with the baby,” MacCorkle said. “Once they’re on more of a routine, she’ll be able to go out of the den for longer periods of time to consume more bamboo because her appetite’s starting to come back.”
The decision to begin showing the pandas to the public will be made by the National Zoo management along with input from keepers, according to MacCorkle. She estimated that showings would not begin until December at the earliest, and would begin in phases, so as to not upset the baby panda.
“This is a busy exhibit in the zoo,” MacCorkle said. “We don’t want to go from having the whole building being quiet to just everybody trying to come in and see this little guy. We’ll ease [him] in.”
MacCorkle said the panda house has become more popular for tourists following the excitement around the baby panda’s birth and subsequent growth. She noted that at the time of the cub’s birth, his older sister Bao Bao was celebrating her second birthday, which also increased attendance.
“There’s always a lot of excitement around [the] panda house, even when there are just adults,” MacCorkle said. “It’s always a busy, bustling place, and even more so with a new cub. … There are a lot of people who are anxious for him to be on exhibit.”
Kate Cole (MSB ’18), president of Animalia, a student group dedicated to ensuring the humane treatment of animals, said that the announcement of the panda’s birth was very exciting, given the difficulties pandas often experience in having children. She said she hopes the baby will inspire the public to learn more about giant pandas.
“I was watching the news and they said they were born and I was very excited,” Cole said. “I know that this is a rarity, a real miracle. Whenever they announce that it will be open, [we] will be going. I’ll plan a trip for Animalia.”
MacCorkie said that visitors can visit the baby at the National Zoo until 2019, when due to an agreement with the Chinese government, the panda will be sent back to participate in a breeding program to help preserve the giant panda species.
“It is sad to see them go to China,” MacCorkle said. “But their big role is to get to save the species. That’s what they get to do, that’s their contribution.”
The Georgetown International Relations Club could not be reached for comment about panda diplomacy.
Maureen Berry (NHS ’18) said that the news of the panda’s birth has made her want to visit the National Zoo, even though she has not kept up to date with the pandas.
“I haven’t followed [news] about the pandas,” Berry said. “But, yeah, I’ll visit the zoo. Who doesn’t love pandas?”

Students participated in focus-group sessions this week as part of an external evaluation of on-campus dining options and the meal plan structure in light of the upcoming expiration of the contract between the university and Aramark, Georgetown’s current auxiliary services partner, later this year.
The sessions, run by the food service consulting firm Envision Strategies, took place Sept. 15 to 17. Organized by class year, the focus groups included 12 students both with and without dining plans.
Students were invited to sign up for the sessions in a university-wide email sent Sept. 12.
In the email, Associate Vice President of Auxiliary Business Services Joelle Wiese wrote that Envision Strategies will develop a new dining master plan to ensure that Georgetown selects a food service provider that best fits the campus.
“The purpose of this engagement is to evaluate our current dining program, the meal plan structure and the overall approach to all dining on campus,” Wiese wrote.
Ari Goldstein (COL ’18), a member of the Georgetown University Student Association Dining Committee who attended one of the focus groups, said that the sessions consisted of hour-long discussions, touching on a variety of topics including limited accessibility, affordability and desirability of existing meal plan options, as well as problems with food quality, hours and management at Leo’s and other on-campus dining locations.
“On a day-to-day level, there’s a lot to be done to improve the Georgetown dining experience, [including] offering higher quality food at Leo’s [and] opening up Grab ’n Go on the weekends.” Goldstein said. “At the Auxiliary Services level, there needs to be much wider and more serious conversations about how to improve our meal plan system.”
Jackson Shain (COL ’18), who also took part in a focus group, said that while the Envision representative did not discuss any concrete plans for the future of Georgetown’s dining program, students were asked a number of questions concerning a new dining hall, their average meal at Leo’s and the most desirable changes to meal plan options.
“One thing that was pretty common was asking for better quality food at Leo’s, especially fresher fruits and vegetables,” Shain wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I definitely think being able to use meal swipes at more places would be awesome.”
With the information gathered at the focus groups, Envision Strategies will use a wide range of methods to analyze Georgetown’s current dining arrangement, including comparing it with peer institutions, engaging students and administrators through focus groups and surveys, observing operations and analyzing the business.
Wiese said that the consultants at Envision Strategies will provide helpful information for Georgetown regarding food services in colleges across the country.
“Food on college campuses has changed quite a bit over the years,” Wiese wrote in an email to The Hoya. “With their level of knowledge of college food service, Envision Strategies will help us develop a strategy and vision.”
According to Wiese, the university conducted a request for proposal process before determining that Envision was the best fit for its interests.
“With all of the changes on campus, the master plan and in the college food industry, this is an excellent opportunity to engage with industry professionals on food and dining here at Georgetown,” Wiese wrote.
Georgetown University Student Association Secretary of Auxiliary Services Nicolette Moore (SFS ’17), who also participated in the focus group, said that the objective of the focus groups was to determine the best options for Georgetown going forward.
“Georgetown students have been frustrated with dining on campus for a long time,” Moore said. “That is no secret. It has become clear that the issue with dining on campus is not simple. It’s not just about Leo’s or Hoya Court or any one component of dining.”
Moore also said that students should become more involved in discussions about the dining program at Georgetown, citing opportunities for students to participate in the biweekly GUSA Dining Committee.
“The idea is getting as many voices and opinions as possible,” Moore said. “GUSA has been heavily involved in these efforts to improve campus dining. … We are finally having serious discussions about how dining fits into master planning.”
Although the university’s contract with Aramark is soon due for renewal, both Moore and Goldstein said that the focus group did not explicitly discuss whether the university should continue using Aramark’s services.
“Clearly students aren’t satisfied with Aramark, so I’m glad the university is seriously considering other options,” Goldstein said. “We’ll have to wait out the bidding process to determine whether Aramark can deliver improvements.”
Adam Shinbrot (COL ’18), a member of the GUSA Dining Committee who did not attend the focus group, said that he would support the university if it chose to switch to another provider.
“This would be contingent on many other factors including price and the services the new company intends to offer Hoyas,” Shinbrot said. “However, given Aramark’s poor track record, I don’t anticipate finding a comparable or better company as a real problem.”

With the introduction of the Institute of Politics and Public Service inaugural Fellows Program class, the center brings leaders from government and the media to campus to lead discussions, interact with students and speak on a variety of current political issues.
The IPPS, which was launched in August, is the McCourt School of Public Policy’s newest initiative, aiming to engage students in the current political landscape.
The five inaugural fellows include Luis Fortuño, the former governor of Puerto Rico, Brianna Keilar, a CNN senior political correspondent, Charlie Spies, an election law attorney at Clark Hill, John Stanton, BuzzFeed’s D.C. bureau chief and Buffy Wicks, national director of Operation Vote and former senior staff member for President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign.
Keilar said she is particularly looking forward to hearing students’ perspectives on the 2016 presidential election.
“I’ve been really impressed so far with how much attention students really do pay to the process,” Keilar said. “They have a lot of interesting opinions that are kind of all over the map. … I’m hoping I can provide students with a bridge into the political world that they’re living right next to.”
Wicks, who worked for Obama for six years, said she hopes her experiences in politics will provide valuable insight for the students.
“I think what we can offer is sort of lift the hood a little bit on the inner workings of politics or media or what we do, and kind of shed some light on how things actually happen,” Wicks said. “I’m inspired by these students; I think it’s a very active campus. … For those of us who have worked in the business a long time, it’s really refreshing to be around that.”
In the next two months, each fellow will lead a 90-minute discussion group on today’s political landscape, open to students from any school in the university.
Additionally, the fellows will interact with and receive advice from student strategy teams, comprised of small groups of students who will conduct research for their discussion sessions and promote the program on campus. Applications to join these teams closed Sept. 18 and final selections will be announced sometime this week.
The teams will also participate in a “Political Hackathon,” in which fellows and students work together to develop solutions for a prevalent issue in politics. The IPPS will publish students’ ideas on its website.
For Stanton, the program is an opportunity to get an honest opinion from an up-and-coming generation of students.
“It’s going to be fun to talk, frankly, through some of the ideas about how technology and young people are shaping politics now,” Stanton said. “How politics is covered by us, and also to get the thoughts of the students about those issues and about how things are playing out.”
Fortuño highlighted how he sees the program as an opportunity to shape both his and the students’ understanding of politics today.
“We’re going to have a great opportunity to challenge perhaps the views that some students may have, and to have them challenge ours,” Fortuño said. “In that process I believe all of us will learn from each other as to how the process operates.”
Spies similarly emphasized that the program is a chance for students and fellows to share their views on the workings of the political system.
“I am excited about the Fellows Program because it’s an opportunity to interact with students and correct some misconceptions about the political process, but also learn what students are currently focused on,” Spies said. “I hope we have a diverse group of students and viewpoints.”
Several of the fellows also touched on possible skepticism from students regarding our current political system and expressed hope that the program could address some of these stereotypes.
Keilar said that the program could quell any student hesitancy about getting involved in politics.
“Once you get into some of the details and you start to look at it in a more molecular way, I think that takes away some of the mystique, which creates some of the mistrust,” Keilar said. “They get some of their questions answered and they can really see … what parts they really like, what parts they don’t like, what parts are broken and therefore what parts their generation has to figure out a way to fix.”
Spies added that the program can facilitate discussions that will potentially counter this student skepticism.
“Mistrust is currently based on ideological opposition to whatever office-holder people don’t like,” Spies said. “I believe that there is a cause or a leader that anyone at Georgetown could get behind. Hopefully we can work together to figure out who those people and causes are.”
Wicks stressed that students have led some of the most innovative movements in political history and that they should feel like they have the power to make substantive change in politics.
“I think students are often at the forefront of social change in this country on a lot of different issues, in a lot of different movements over the history of this country,” Wicks said. “I think what we hope to do here is also provide other discussions about avenues of ways to get involved.”
Stanton agreed that students often do not realize their influence on politics.
“They don’t realize that the tools to do it are already existent, in fact they are very much using them, much more than any other generation,” Stanton said. “If you look at Black Lives Matter, or you look at the Arab Spring, those were things that were created essentially by young people using the technologies that young people are using on this campus right now.”
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Charlie Spies is currently an attorney for the Republican National Committee. Spies previously served as a counsel to the RNC.

Students in Hoyas for Immigrant Rights will join 100 migrant women on the last few miles of their 100 Women, 100 Mile Pilgrimage for Migrant Justice from Pennsylvania to D.C. to greet Pope Francis at his meeting with Congress.
More than 40 students will meet the women and their supporters outside Georgetown and walk to McPherson Square Sept. 22 to try and meet the pope.
The 100 Women, 100 Mile pilgrimage, organized by a nonprofit called We Belong Together, began Sept. 15 at a detention center in York County, Pennsylvania. One hundred migrant women and their supporters set off on a pilgrimage through Pa. and Maryland toward D.C. to highlight Pope Francis’ statements on immigration and vie for a conversation with the pope himself.
Pope Francis has previously described conditions of migrants travelling from Mexico into the United States as “inhumane.” He has also encouraged European leaders to accept more Syrian refugees.
HFIR co-chair Alexis Larios (COL ’18) said immigration is an urgent issue with disproportionately negative impacts on women and children.
“One thing that we really feel is important is to look at how women immigrants are treated, because compared to men they have it significantly harder, especially in detention centers and the immigration process,” Larios said. “Things that can especially affect women and children more harshly, such as sexual assault, men may not necessarily be subject to as much. Right now, we have this rhetoric going around that’s not really looking at immigration from that standpoint.”
Maria Lira, a domestic worker living in Houston, Texas, is one of the women taking part in the larger pilgrimage. Lira spoke of the often poor working conditions she and other immigrants have faced after arriving to the United States.
“I can tell you a million stories about how I feel every day when I’m listening to a lot of other immigrants who are working very hard,” Lira said. “These people are vulnerable, and people can take advantage of them very easily. … We just want to share our story with the pope. He’s a strong and powerful leader, and we want him to listen to us and help us get the respect and dignity that we need, because everybody deserves the same treatment.”
From Oct. 1, 2014 to July 31, 2015 more than 30,000 unaccompanied children and 29,000 families, many of whom were fleeing violence, were apprehended at the southwestern border. There are now thought to be 12 million undocumented residents in the United States, according to Reuters.
Current immigration practices include the detainment of asylum-seeking women and children, the separation of mothers from their families and the continuous threat of deportation for the undocumented, according to the 100 Women, 100 Mile pilgrimage website.
HFIR will be joining pilgrimage host We Belong Together, a campaign that brings together the National Domestic Workers Alliance and the National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum with the aim of uniting women to mobilize for improved immigration policies. Other partner organizations participating in the pilgrimage include Not1More, Capital Area Immigrants’ Rights Coalition, People Improving Communities Through Organizing and Interfaith Worker Justice.
Rosa Sanluis, another participant, said she wants immigrant communities to be viewed with dignity and respect.
“My story is not that different from the ones from other immigrants,” Sanluis said. “Domestic workers are not treated well. For example an employer may threaten that if you raise your voice or break something, they will call immigration to take you back to your country. You have to deal with this because you don’t have anywhere else to go. … We want to take this message to Pope Francis, so that he can be able to move the hearts of congressmen.”
Larios added that the all-women pilgrimage aims to bring attention to gender-specific immigrant struggles.
“When you think of a typical immigrant, you think of a man coming across, but you have to realize that women and children are doing the exact same thing,” Larios said. “We’ve seen this with the Syrian crisis, and right now with children coming over it’s important to see that that’s happening here in the United States as well.”
Larios acknowledged HFIR’s support of the pilgrimage as a way of bringing attention to the issue in the hopes of facilitating change.
“This is really about bringing light to human suffering and human dignity,” Larios said. “That’s what the women really want to get across—that we look at this issue from the stories of actual people who are going through a lot.”

The Georgetown University Student Association announced Friday that the university hired Anisha Thadani as its first access coordinator and events manager, a position that will address accessibility issues for students with disabilities on campus.
According to a statement released by GUSA, Thadani began work in August. She will be the primary point of contact for issues related to campus spaces and access routes, and will oversee programming requests.
The appointment comes after student advocacy over the past few years to improve campus accessibility for students with disabilities. In meetings between GUSA and student advocates, both called for the university to coordinate resources for students with disabilities in a more streamlined manner.
GUSA President Joe Luther (COL ’16) expressed his excitement to work with Thadani in her new role.
“We are happy to welcome Ms. Thadani to Georgetown and are excited about the work she will do to improve accessibility. We will continue to work with student advocates both inside and outside of GUSA to make Georgetown a more accessible place for all,” Luther wrote in a statement.
In the past year, initiatives such as the campaign for a Disability Cultural Center at Georgetown have also gained traction. In February, former GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) and Vice President Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15) expressed their support for the DCC, which was initiated by former GUSA Undersecretary for Disability Affairs Lydia Brown (COL ’15).
As these efforts continue, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said that he looks forward to working with Thadani and GUSA to address important issues related to accessibility.
“We are enthused to have Anisha Thadani join our staff team, and we’re pleased to work together with GUSA and our students to strengthen our work on critical issues of accessibility,” Olson wrote in a statement.
Thadani declined to comment on her new position.

The first annual Healey Family Student Center Concert took place Friday evening, with YouTube star Phoebe Ryan performing as the headlining professional act.
Other acts included performances from Daniel Breland (MSB ’17), Teddy Schaffer (COL ’16) and student band Faces for Radio, who volunteered to perform at the event.
Approximately 140 Georgetown students attended the free event in the Great Room of the HFSC to hear the live performances, which began at 10 p.m.
The event was organized by the HFSC Program Funds after a university-wide survey last year showed that students would like to see more live music at the venue. Student managers of the HFSC were also involved in the planning and development of the concert.
The concert was free for all Georgetown students, and attendees were allowed to bring one extra guest to the event.

HFSC Activities Director Patrick Ledesma said that the building management wanted to provide on-campus entertainment for students on weekends.
“I think to have an avenue for students to come out of the residence halls is super important,” Ledesma said. “We value academics wholly at this university, but there’s also a fun side, and what I want to do is to be able to use this new building to show that there is a great space for students. We want to have this social avenue to collaborate, relax, and socialize.”
According to Ledesma, Ryan’s status as an up-and-coming independent artist was a quality that the HFSC programming division considered when selecting her.
“We found the artist by staying on top of trends, and also really trying to find out who is on the cusp of becoming big,” Ledesma said. “I would love to see who is out there that would really love to break out.”
The concert was part of the building management’s initiative to increase programming, which includes both small- and large-scale events. Prior to the concert, the HFSC also hosted a live band karaoke event last week and a carnival-themed birthday celebration for the building’s first anniversary.
Schaffer said that hosting events such as the HFSC Concert is important for campus life.
“I think it’s awesome that they’re doing this,” Schaffer said. “It’s a good way to use the space at the HFSC. It brings a lot of artsy vibes to campus.”
Ethan Beaman (COL ’16), the guitarist of Faces for Radio, praised the event for its musical diversity and said that his band would enjoy playing at the HFSC again.
“I thought the event had really good energy, with a nice variety in musical talent,” Beaman said. “Daniel Breland had a cool ‘Frank Ocean’ vibe. … I was really proud of our performance as well.”
The main act was Phoebe Ryan, a 25-year-old Los Angeles-based singer who studied as an audio engineering and production student at New York University before composing her own songs.
Despite having released only two original songs, as well as a popular cover of R. Kelly’s “Ignition” and Miguel’s “Do You,” Ryan has amassed over one million plays on SoundCloud.
The HFSC hopes to increase publicity for its upcoming events by getting more co-sponsors, as well as receiving more student feedback. Ledesma contacted the newly founded student-run record label Clock Hand Records after the event to express his interest in a partnership.
Students at the event said that they enjoyed the music and the intimacy of the performances.
Lydia Bubniak (SFS ’18) said that she hopes the HFSC will hold similar concerts in the future.
“The concert was great due to the intimacy the crowd was able to have with the audience,” Bubniak said. “I hope Georgetown is able to organize more events like these for students who really appreciate live music.”

Students can register as bone marrow donors in a recruitment drive in Red Square next Friday as part of a nationwide initiative to solicit marrow donations from college students by Gift of Life, an international bone marrow registry.
Rajia Arbab (COL ’18), GOL campus ambassador, coordinated the recruitment at Georgetown, which is the first marrow donation drive on campus, with hopes to recruit donors and increase awareness for types of blood cancer.
According to GOL Founder Jay Feinberg, the purpose of the campus ambassador program was specifically to recruit college students to join the bone marrow database.
“The majority of donors who are requested by transplant centers are between the ages of 18 and 25, making the university setting the best possible place to host education sessions and donor recruitment drives,” Feinberg wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In response to this demand, Gift of Life created a network of more than 100 students from campuses across the country to recruit donors.
To register as donors, students fill out their contact information and complete a cheek swab. Once their kits are returned to the GOL office in Boca Raton, Fla., they receive an email to complete the registration process. Each donor test kit incurs a $60 laboratory processing fee, which funds tissue typing and entry into the worldwide donor registry, where a donor’s marrow may be selected for surgical use.
Arbab, who is currently on the pre-med track, said that she chose to apply to GOL as she believed that it was an organization that could change others’ lives.
“A family friend of mine suggested that I get involved with the organization,” Arbab said. “I decided to apply because I believe that when our lives are involved in changing the lives of others, our own lives will be changed for the better.”
As campus ambassador, Arbab works 10 hours per week to increase GOL’s presence on campus. She said that the most rewarding part of her job was being able to spread awareness about GOL and its efforts to save the lives of those suffering from blood cancer and leukemia.
“My objective is to swab as many students as possible this year … knowing that every individual I swab could potentially be the donor that saves a life,” Arbab said.
According to Arbab, registering to be a donor is an effortless process for students.
“Gift of Life will allow Hoyas on campus to potentially be the ones to save the lives of patients suffering from leukemia or blood cancer,” Arbab said. “Sixty seconds is all it takes to join the bone marrow registry and be the person to give another human being the gift of life.”
According to GOL Director of the Campus Ambassador Program Nick Hudson, the benefits of bone marrow donation are rewarding.
“A lot of people sign up to be a bone marrow donor, myself included, without ever knowing, or thinking that they’re going to get called,” Hudson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “You’re told it’s a one in a thousand shot, even if you get called there’s not a great chance you’re the best match. But then, in times like mine, when I got called for a little boy that had leukemia, you never really expect it.”
After the first donation drive next Friday, Arbab plans to host five more donor registration drives in both Georgetown and the D.C.-Maryland-Virginia area to swab cheeks and find a match for those suffering from blood cancer and leukemia.
According to Hudson, bone marrow donation is extremely rewarding due to its life-changing nature.
“I think the best part is that you could just be walking through the quad one day, and decide to do something in passing, and it winds up having this unbelievable effect and saving someone’s life. … Your life and someone else’s life can hinge on a split second decision that probably won’t affect you for a really long time,” Hudson said.

The first lecture of School of Foreign Service Senior Associate Dean for Undergraduate Affairs Daniel Byman’s Terrorism and Counterterrorism Massive Online Open Course took place at the Mortara Center for International Studies Monday evening.
Drawing more than 40 attendees, the course is part of the second wave of MOOCs introduced by Georgetown last year in concordance with edX, an international online education platform.
Byman gave the introductory lecture on the phenomenon of foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria, with a specific focus on the Islamic State group.
Byman said that he decided to offer this lecture in person, as a high volume of people who registered for the course lived locally. The lecture was recorded and will be added to the course’s edX page later this week.
The course is offered free on the edX website to anyone with Internet access and is graded on a pass/fail basis. So far, 5,100 people from 149 countries have enrolled in the course. Students who complete the course are awarded a certificate.
Byman began his lecture by extricating the reality of foreign fighters from the impression created of them by the media.
“I would argue that the threat from foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria is real, but also it’s overstated,” Byman said. “In my opinion, it’s a manageable threat.”
Byman continued by linking the problem of foreign fighters to Al-Qaeda’s history, which began with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. As Al-Qaeda was largely composed of foreign fighters who were “made comrades” by the Soviets, Byman emphasized the “sense of brotherhood” that wars created among jihadists.
Byman then discussed how foreign fighters became tied by ideology and eventually gained valuable fighting experience.
“So rather than people who run away from gunfire, which is a perfectly normal reaction, [they] become well adapted people who can move forward, who show a certain degree of sanguineness,” Byman said.
Byman then explained how terrorists could even get advanced training and were using foreign language skills to operate abroad.
In articulating the dangers posed by foreign fighters, Byman pointed to studies that suggest foreign fighters make terrorist plots more successful.
An important point Byman often mentioned was the role of social media, with jihadists using social media to attract fighters and supporters to their cause. He added that this also makes it easier for counter-terrorists to keep track of terror networks.
“Individual fighters are able to use Twitter or other forms of social media to reach large numbers of friends as well as lions in the jungle, and they all become propagandists,” Byman said.
Byman concluded his talk with a question-and-answer period. Topics ranged from Islamophobia, which he said was intractable, to the effects of foreign fighters on the influx of refugees from Syria, which he attributed to the brutality of foreign fighters.
Yasmin Faruki (SFS ’16), who attended the event despite not being a student of the MOOC, praised the lecture.
“I thought it was great. It was really informative,” Faruki said. “It gave a good overview of this situation with foreign fighters in the Middle East.”
Annie Kennelly (SFS ’15), who is participating in the MOOC, said she enjoyed hearing Byman’s perspective.
“I thought he had a very unique point of view compared to a lot of voices in the media and a lot of other scholars too,” Kennelly said.
Kennelly said that she was excited to continue her participation in the MOOC.
“A lot of interesting professors will be involved, which is different from a lot of MOOCs too because it’s not just one person,” Kennelly said.
After the event, Byman said he felt the course launch was successful.
“The event today was meant to serve multiple purposes. … It was an attempt to put a face on the online course, so to bring together the local participants and just get them to know each other in a way that would make the course richer,” Byman said.

In the first iteration of the Well Talks sponsored by the Protestant Ministry, Georgetown University Brothers for Christ, GU Sisters for Christ and Protestant chaplain Rev. Khristi Adams led a student discussion of the Black Lives Matter social movement.
The Well Talks, which are held the third Sunday of every month, focus on fostering community discussion and healing on contemporary issues in an open-table conversation.
With more than 60 students in attendance, Adams led the dialogue but left most of the commentary to the group.
Initially framed as a debate between the movements of #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter, the session developed into a discussion of and commentary on the discrepancies between the movements on a personal and national level.
Adams began the discussion by contextualizing the movements on a national level and defining the platforms of both #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter. Over the hour-and-a-half session, student commentary turned internally to Georgetown’s onus to advance a message of inclusion.
Students raised concerns, including a perceived lack of black professors and foreign language professors native to a country where their language is spoken.
Students also ruminated on the naming of the newly renovated Former Jesuit Residence, comprised of both Ryan Hall and Mulledy Hall. Concerns over insensitivity were raised as former University President Rev. Thomas F. Mulledy, S.J., after whom the building was named, had participated in slave trade.
While no specific conclusion was reached during the debate, Protestant Chaplaincy Director Rev. Bryant M. Oskvig spoke to the merit of the Well Talks’ open-table format for learning and exchanging ideas.
“I think that we are a campus that is still trying to figure out where the blue and gray lie,” Oskvig said. “What is great about this discussion is that even if someone is possessing a position that [one student] didn’t necessarily hold, [it is] an opportunity to hear different voices … and I thought it was great that the conversation could really be brought locally.”
Adams said that she wanted the discussion to be a platform for students to openly express their views.
“The best way to show that we care about students’ opinions is to provide a space for them, and a consistent one at that,” Adams said.
Adams also said that the Well Talks were a forum for respectful disagreement, which may not be fostered in digital-centric spaces.
“I see with this generation that the respect and empathy and open-table discussions … are not what I see in social media,” Adams said. “The message that we’re trying to permit is that it’s okay to disagree and to hear each other out no matter where one student falls on one spectrum or another.”
Adams said that she conceptualized the Well Talks after she started a similar program for high school students over the summer.
“There was a space that I had provided for younger high school students this past summer, and [I] wanted to see how we could do that on campus,” Adams said.
Adams collaborated with Coordinator for Ecumenical Christian Life Jordan Blackwell (COL ’15), who lent his familiarity with student dialogue to help organize the Well Talks series around hot-button issues on campus.
Blackwell said that he wanted to approach the sensitive topic through intellectual discussion.
“There has been a lot of talk about racial tensions and [Black Lives Matter],” Blackwell said. “We didn’t want this to be an event where the same people stand up on their soap box and spit emotions.”
While not all Well Talks will be focused on social or racial issues, Blackwell said that the demographic of the Protestant community on campus was influential in determining the topic for the first talk.
“It’s highly minority students, and those are the students that we feel need these spaces,” Blackwell said. “It’s a different experience going throughout Georgetown, and sometimes you can feel alone and that you aren’t able to fully express yourself. We just want to say that here is a space that you can do that.”
Adams said that she hopes the talks will engage students to share their opinions in an open setting.
“Those are Jesuit principles and principles of our ministry here. That’s what we see as being the difference in these types of conversations, and I’m hoping these students took that message away,”
