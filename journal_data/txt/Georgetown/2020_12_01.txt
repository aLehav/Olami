When Cole Brown (COL ’18) sat down in his sophomore year entrepreneurship class with Georgetown University professor Eric Koester and found out he had to write a 20,000 word manuscript, he immediately knew the assignment was an opportunity to write about his experiences as a Black man. 
Growing up in a predominantly white neighborhood in Pennsylvania, where he attended private schools throughout his childhood, he struggled to find an accurate representation of himself in the media, Brown said in an interview with Forbes this year. 
“The story of being young and in search of self and in search of identity that a lot of people feel, whether it’s Black negotiating white spaces or some other combination of traits, there is something universal about that,” Brown said in an interview with The Hoya. 
In September, Brown published his book, “Greyboy: Finding Blackness in a White World,” which expands on the original manuscript he wrote as a student in Koester’s class five years ago.
Brown’s book is composed of a series of essays in which he explores the journey of the Black identity in a world of white privilege. He wrote on a variety of topics, such as parenting, police brutality, the rhetoric of President Trump, mental health and dating, according to Brown’s website. 
“The book tells the story of me and kids like me struggling with what I view as a very limited understanding of what Blackness is, you know, trying to negotiate being one thing and, yet, the world telling you that you should be something else,” Brown said. “The desired impact would be to slightly expand that definition, to add another facet to a definition that is all too limited to include kids like me.” 
When Brown arrived at Georgetown in 2014, he was enrolled in the McDonough School of Business, set on pursuing a career in finance. Uninterested in the conversations he was having in the MSB, however, Brown said he began searching for alternative options that provided more provocative dialogue. He eventually found the Justice and Peace Studies program after transferring to the College his sophomore year. 
“I think that a lot of the book charts my journey towards adulthood and identity and so forth,” he said. “I was exposed to such a diversity of people and characters that I now hold dear, who shaped how I look at the world, and that couldn’t have happened without Georgetown.”
Although Brown never intended to be an author, Koester knew his original manuscript had the potential for success from the start, according to an email Koester wrote to The Hoya. 
“When I read his very first story, I knew he had to get the story, the words and his work, out there and thankfully as a result of that first draft he created he was able to secure a book agent and get a publishing deal,” Koester wrote. 
Brown does not plan to stop writing anytime soon, and he has already started both a novel and a short film in Sydney, Australia, where he lives part time, he said. 
“There are a lot of people broadening the definition of Blackness in the media,” Brown said. “I’m hoping that this can just be added to that canon.”

Anthony Chung (COL ’21), 22, died from injuries sustained in a vehicle accident in Madison, Wis. on Sept. 17. 
Chung, who went by Tony, was double majoring in government and economics and minoring in philosophy. While at Georgetown University, he helped to co-found the Georgetown Midwest Club and was an active member of the Asian American Student Association and the Parliamentary Debate Team. 
Chung dedicated his life to improving the lives of others, and he challenged others to do the same, according to Andrew DeFriece (COL ’20), a close friend.  
“Tony was truly a unique soul, and he is best described through the impressions he would leave with those he chose to spend his time with,” DeFriece wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Every day of his life, Tony actively lived out his pursuit to bring justice and peace to the underserved and oppressed, and he always strived to incorporate those he was close to in his fight for a myriad of social justice initiatives.” 
Born and raised in Madison, Wis., Chung began to show a passion for government in high school as a member of his high school’s debate team and a student representative for his district to the Madison School Board. Chung was also a talented cellist and pianist.
Chung was a compassionate person who cared about his friends and loved ones and was a pleasure to work with, according to Vanessa Corcoran, his advising dean.
“The longer he spent at Georgetown, the more he really embraced everything about the liberal arts curriculum. He started off as a government major, but as he progressed, he started to expand,” Corcoran said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. 
Fellow Georgetown debate team member Cayleigh Soderholm (SFS ’20) remembered Chung as a talented debater and an amazing friend who brightened everyone’s day in an email she wrote to The Hoya.
“Tony was a great addition to the team; he was relentlessly fun-loving and had a fantastic sense of humor,” Soderholm wrote. “His presence in car rides to tournaments brightened everyone’s days, and his natural talent more than made up for his easygoing approach to debate.” 
Chung was always himself and took interest in others, according to Nicholas Cramer (MSB ’20), who served as president of the Midwest Club.
“Tony was the most humble, joyous, genuine person I’ve ever been lucky enough to know,” Cramer wrote in an email to The Hoya. “He treated everyone as a long-lost friend. Whether you hadn’t seen each other for a whole summer or just a whole afternoon, Tony was always quick to greet you with a big hug and an even bigger smile. He was the rare type of person that could bring an infectious happiness into every room he entered, and he will be missed beyond what words can describe.” 
Chung left a lasting impression on the people and communities he came across, and he strived to understand everyone he met, according to DeFriece. 
“Tony would always leave those around him feeling genuinely seen. He took the time to consider the complex backgrounds of those close to him, and always strived to acknowledge how their experiences influenced their actions and worldview,” DeFriece wrote.“Tony’s distinctive philosophies about how he wished to impact the world and those he was close to have left a resounding influence upon the communities he has left behind.” 
Tony is survived by his parents, his grandparents and his partner Rory Demick. The official GoFundMe page for his memorial costs has raised more than $3000.

Tony was my patient from the time he was born. He was a joyous child right from the start. He always made me smile… and laugh. We lost a wonderful soul too soon… Beautiful tribute!

“Lawyers as Leaders,” a one-credit course combining legal scholarship with personal perspectives, drew the largest enrollment for any class at the Georgetown University Law Center, with 330 registered students. 
The course, taught by William Treanor, dean of the Law Center, was initially created this year as part of the Law Center’s ongoing 150th anniversary celebrations. 
Featuring a different Law Center faculty member for each week’s lecture, “Lawyers as Leaders” focused on faculty members’ careers, personal lives and experiences with leadership in law. The class featured conversations on a broad spectrum of issues, ranging from health policy and corporations to social justice and policing. 
Students’ interest in understanding leadership to make a difference is the course’s main attraction, according to Treanor.
“People have a hunger for understanding leadership. They want to make a change. They look around the world, and they see a need to make this world a more just place, to make a difference,” Treanor said in an interview with The Hoya. “An opportunity to have a course in which they listen to people who in different ways have made a difference, reflect on that and think about what the arc of their own careers should look like, I think that’s the biggest driver of the course.”
Invited speakers offer perspective on the values central to their careers, according to Lawrence Gostin, the Founding O’Neill Chair in Global Health Law and the first featured speaker for the course.
“It gives students a chance to reflect on their careers, their passions, and their aspirations for a life well lived,” Gostin wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The class therefore invites students to engage with leaders to understand the various qualities of leadership. Many of these qualities will come as a surprise, such as being humble, kind, and generous with your time.”
The switch to an online format has allowed the course to overcome the physical limitations of being in an in-person setting and directly led to its increased popularity among students, according to Treanor.
After each discussion, recordings of the discussion sessions are made publicly available online. Law Center faculty made this decision in order to maximize students’ opportunities to listen and learn from the course, according to Treanor.
The opportunity for connection between professors and students makes this course a positive asset for the future, according to Victoria Nourse, a Ralph V. Whitworth Professor of Law at Georgetown and one of the course’s featured speakers.
“GULC is a large law school and people are busy: teaching classes, writing books, appearing on television, moving in and out of government, arguing Supreme Court cases, etc. The class reminded us of the need to “connect” some of the busier folks to a wider array of students,” Nourse wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Those needs won’t go away after the pandemic, so I expect that the course will continue to be a great experience.”
In the future, the Law Center aims to make this class a long-time, signature event or a foundational course, likely with a different professor as the moderator and with rotating featured speakers to focus on similar discussions about leadership, according to Treanor.
The intrigue of learning about leadership and the accomplished line of speakers made this course stand out to students, according to Associate Dean and professor Hillary Sale, who co-created the course alongside Dean Paul Ohm.
“Leadership is of growing interest to law students, and that in combination with the powerful line up of faculty and Dean Treanor as the ‘Professor’ made for a great course offering,” Sale wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Treanor challenged students to define their own goals for using their law degree and to connect with the narratives of professionals who have found success, according to Hollie Chenault (LAW ’21), a J.D. candidate at the Law Center who worked as a teaching assistant for the course.
“Students learned how eight professors wielded their legal education to marshal change in areas such as health care and policing,” Chenault wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The course challenged students to reflect on how they, too, could use their law degree to become active leaders throughout their careers.”
Beyond the values of the course itself, “Lawyers as Leaders” played an essential role in connecting students to their institution and with each other in the online learning environment, according to Chenault.
“During a virtual semester in which many students feel removed or detached from their institutions, I believe this course gave our students a sense of belonging and community that was much needed,” Chenault wrote.
