The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday in a landmark case that could reshape the employment practices of religious institutions.
Since the passing of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, religious institutions have been considered exempt from many anti-discrimination laws. However, a teacher who was fired from a Lutheran school in Michigan after taking sick leave for narcolepsy is claiming that her rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act were violated, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit agreed.
It is unclear how the Court’s decision could affect Georgetown.
Assistant Vice President for Communications Stacy Kerr declined to address whether Georgetown officials have discussed the pending case, or if Georgetown claims religious immunity on matters of employment discrimination.
“We await the Court’s ultimate decision, so that we can assess the impact, if any, on Georgetown University,” Kerr said.
Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., vice president of mission and ministry, declined to comment.
This is one of the first cases in which the Supreme Court has considered whether religious schools should be required to meet the same non-discrimination requirements as other institutions.
Professor Andrea Mayer, who teaches constitutional law at Georgetown and has worked for the federal government on employment discrimination cases, said she was not surprised that the case has reached the Supreme Court.
“Any time there is a persistent U.S. Court of Appeals split concerning constitutional interpretation,” she said, “It doesn’t surprise me that the Supreme Court would want to resolve that – serving that important function of providing consistency in the law.”
The debate before the court centers on whether faculty at religious schools who are teaching secular subjects should receive the same legal treatment as religious leaders. The school argues that it is impossible to distinguish what is secular and non-secular in religious education.
“There is a really interesting debate about how religious institutions operate, and the degree to which every member of that institution is carrying out a religious purpose,” Mayer said. “I think this decision could have a fairly broad-sweeping impact on all types of religious institutions.”
Dozens of amicus briefs have been filed, including one from a group of law and religion professors who believe that the ministerial exception has no constitutional basis.
“What’s at stake are the protections for hundreds of thousands of people who work for religious employers,” brief co-author Caroline Mala Corbin, a professor at the University of Miami School of Law told The Hoya. “The question is will they be covered by anti-discrimination laws? Will they have the right to sue if they’ve been discriminated against on the basis of race, or age, or sex, or as is the case here, disabilities?”
Advocates for the exception argue that giving the courts the authority to determine who is and is not serving a religious function would create an excessive entanglement between the government and religious institutions, which past Supreme Court decisions have condemned.
Corbin argues that the exception creates the greatest entanglement.
“In my view, it should be eliminated entirely, and it shouldn’t matter if you are a minister,” she explained. “If you have a discrimination claim, you should be able to bring it.”

The Georgetown University Student Association Senate inaugurated a full class of senators tonight following the election last Thursday.
The voting participation rate this year was about 25 percent, with 1,946 undergraduates casting ballots. This is significantly higher than last year, almost doubling the number of students casting an electronic ballot. However, 200 of those votes were considered invalid in the at-large election, as they failed to properly rank the candidates.
Overall, 56 students competed for 27 spots in the senate. Write-in candidates filled the two seats that did not have declared candidates.
To determine the winners, the GUSA election commission uses an instant runoff system in which voters rank candidates in order of preference. The candidate who gets the least votes is eliminated in each round, and the loser’s votes are reassigned to the voters’ next choice.
The New South Hall race was the most heated, with 220 votes counted into the seventh round. The Village A E-H district, which cast 25 votes in the second round, had the least amount of interest.
The senate increased in size this year from 25 to 27 senators, after two at-large seats representing the entire student body were added in a legislative session in the beginning of the semester before campaigns began.
The bill expanding the senate was introduced by Adam Mortillaro (COL ’12), speaker of the senate, to the transition committee of the senate — an interim group that controls the legislature from the end of the spring semester until new senators are inaugurated in October.
“This was a change which originated within the executive because at the SAC fair … a number of people expressed interest in running for the senate,” Mortillaro said.
The modification was meant to open more positions for those hoping to get involved and passed overwhelmingly on the floor. It was the first expanision of the senate since it was downsized two years ago for lack of interest.
“We think that this was, in hindsight, a good move,” he said.

Georgetown University Television hits the airwaves this fall with an expanded lineup of both videos and professional connections for the student-run station.
Founded in 1998 by a small group of students interested in film and broadcasting, GUTV  has made an effort in recent years to expand its programming. In the process, it has become an important stepping stone for students looking for careers in television.
“I would say that we definitely place a bigger emphasis on shows now at GUTV, but we are also really focused on creating those connections and relationships with big names in the field that will definitely help members in the future,” said Megan Acheampong (COL ’13), general manager of GUTV.
Some of those efforts include weekly trips to the CBS news studio, where members are able to learn about the industry first-hand and interact with leaders in the field.
In past years, GUTV has had members intern at entertainment giants such as Nickelodeon and MTV.Acheampong interned in Beverly Hills this summer and will be interning at the Grammy Awards this upcoming summer.
“In today’s cutthroat entertainment industry, you have to have something to show for yourself when you go to apply to graduate school or look for a job,” she said. “Putting together a portfolio can be very expensive, and we have the resources that can make the whole process easier for students.”
GUTV covers events around campus — from graduation to Film Fest — in addition to featuring seven student-produced shows.
One of these shows, “Full Court Press,” was started by friends Coerte Voorhees (COL ’12) and James Pickens (COL ’12). The political talk show is loosely based on shows like “Meet the Press.”
The program, which debuted this year, places a special focus on interviews and debates. In the past, they have featured a wide range of guests across the political spectrum, such as professor Maxwell Gross of the university’s Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding and members of the Georgetown Democrats and Republicans, for open debates and discussions. This year, former Virginia Governor Tim Kaine and Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.) have agreed to make an appearance.
“We have had many esteemed people on our show who have done great things in the field, and we have made excellent, memorable shows,” Voorhees said. “I still find that Georgetown students who come on the show never cease to impress me, and they make for the best entertainment. Personally, I think they sound better than most of the people on MSNBC and CNN.”
Acheampong thinks that students like Voorhees and others at GUTV have the potential to succeed in the future.
“Those are the kinds of students who thrive here at Georgetown. Wherever they are in life, they are going to excel. I think that GUTV is just another one of those examples of an organization that can help students to excel. It’s a great stepping stone,” she said.

The university unveiled plans at a student forum on Monday night to finish the New South Student Center by August 2014.
Updated architectural models for the space include a club-like food venue, breakout rooms, a gathering space and a large multi-purpose room for banquets, lectures, musical performances and other events.
Fundraising for the renovation, estimated to cost $15.5 million, will begin as part of a planned Capital campaign set to kick off at the end of the month.
The center could also include space to serve alcohol, according to Todd Olson, vice president for student affairs. The proposed alcohol venue would resemble a bar or lounge but would not be solely focused on serving alcohol.
“The administration is seriously interested in having a venue that serves alcohol in that space,” Olson said.
Olson addressed concerns that a venue serving alcohol would detract from the student center’s intended undergraduate focus, saying that New South’s location will help moderate graduate student presence. In order to offer the new amenities, the renovated space will no longer provide office space for student organizations.
According to Olson, clubs that currently work out of the Riverside Lounge will likely be moved to theLeavey Center, which will undergo a restoration process of its own within a few years.
Architect Bill Ash of SmithGroup, the firm that is designing the center, cautioned that the designs were not permanent.
“The plans are just a guideplate. They are absolutely not set in stone,” he said.
Ash laid out a timetable for the renovation process that he described as “aggressive.” The timeline detailed the fundraising campaign and the current feasibility stage, during which SmithGroup will assess how its design plans will fit with the student space, will be followed by a design documentation process that is expected to run from May 2012 to February 2013.
Georgetown University Student Association Senator Colton Malkerson (COL ’13), who serves as chair of the Finance and Appropriations Committee, described GUSA’s role in the redesign as one aimed at facilitating continued student input in the process.
“GUSA is responsible for ensuring students have an appropriate and important voice in the student center,” Malkerson said.
According to Ash, students will have a more involved role in planning the center’s function andaesthetic once the design phase begins.
GUSA will also determine the extent to which student finances contribute to the renovation based on a student body referendum slated for the end of this semester. If other plans for the Student Activities Fee Endowment fall through — including the proposed Healy Pub — the student center could receive up to $1.75 million of student funding.
With additional funding from students, the space could feature design enhancements such as a green roof and fireplaces, according to Malkerson.

To many a tour-taker, the strong Jesuit identity on campus seems to promise a refreshing lack of fraternity-related frivolity.
“When I was looking at colleges, the last thing that I wanted was Greek life,” says Mitchel Hochberg (SFS ’15). “That’s what I liked about Georgetown.”
Hochberg, like most incoming freshmen, arrived on campus in August under the impression that the only Greek he would have to know during the next four years was the first half of the phrase “HoyaSaxa.” To his surprise, he discovered a network of fraternities and sororities that is both alive and active.
Now a pledge of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity, an international Jewish fraternity with over 150 chapters and 40 members at Georgetown, Hochberg stifled a laugh as he recalled his recent change of heart.
“I didn’t want Greek life to be an essential part of the social life on campus, and yet I wound up joining a fraternity as an essential part of my social life.”
Hochberg is not alone in his newfound appreciation of the Greek alphabet. As the fourth full week of the fall semester begins, pledging is in full swing at the majority of the university’s nearly dozen fraternities and sororities.
Many of these lettered organizations, flourishing despite a lack of formal recognition, will spend most of this month introducing curious new members to a Greek tradition that has existed at Georgetown for almost a century.
From service-oriented to socially focused to pre-professional, 11 fraternities and sororities bring Georgetown brothers and sisters together. But striking today’s balance between university interests and student motivations was no simple task for the first students engaging in Greek life.
 
THE RISE AND FALL
The first fraternity to arrive on the Hilltop debuted shortly after the formal opening of the School of Foreign Service in October 1919. The creation of four SFS students in November of that year, Delta Phi Epsilon (DPE) became Georgetown’s Greek guinea pig in January 1920. Its mission aimed to unite foreign service junkies behind a common banner.
By 1946, 11 fraternities had sprung up to fill the career education needs for a variety of disciplines.
The fraternities operated for more than a decade under the umbrella of university funding but began to run into resistance in 1956 as their members became more social than professional. An increasingly large number of alcohol-related incidents were reported over the next few semesters. By the fall of 1958, Dr. John Parr, the dean of the SFS, had grown weary of empty kegs replacing educational conversation at many campus fraternities.
In a statement issued in September of that year, Parr ordered all fraternities associated with the SFS to give up their houses by September 1, 1960. Those who did not comply with the declaration would no longer be recognized by the SFS, and the remaining Greek life was deflated as the fraternities fell away. Of the school’s four fraternities, three survived the transformation from university organizations to independently operated student groups — Delta Phi Epsilon, Alpha Phi Omega and Delta Sigma Pi — leaving the fourth, Alpha Kappa Phi, to rejoin the Greek alphabet soup.
 
BIG THREE
Fifty years later, Delta Phi Epsilon is alive and well, boasting over 40 members in its fraternity. When the university withdrew its support, the fraternity chose to keep its independently owned house. Breaking from the university payroll, it continued business as usual. In February 1973, the fraternity expanded to include a female counterpart, the Delta Phi Epsilon Sorority, for young women with similar global interests. Today, the sorority is comprised of over 20 members.
Founded in 1956, the service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega, another of the three survivors, took a different route forward. Working in compliance with Student Handbook guidelines, which stipulated that clubs must be open to all undergraduate students and that there can be no discriminatory entrance requirements, admitted women in 1977.
This change made APO the only fraternity on campus to be recognized by the university. Decades after the decision was made, APO remains the only Greek body to have received the nod from the administration. Today, APO has over 100 students in its ranks.
“We don’t have an application process or any kind of bid process,” says Erin Brinig (MSB ’13), vice president of communications for APO. “If you want to pledge, you can sign up and pledge.”
This pledge process, which began for APO on Friday, differs from typical notions of fraternity life. Requiring pledges to complete a certain amount of community service, fraternity leaders hope the six-week period helps new members realize the importance of friendship, leadership and service — the group’s cardinal principles.
“Greek life at Georgetown is different,” Brinig says. “A lot of fraternities, in addition to APO, offer more than just hanging out. You have the professional sorority and fraternity, the foreign service ones, the business ones. They have focuses too, and that adds to those organizations.”
Kelsey Steele (MSB ’12), vice president of marketing for Alpha Kappa Psi, would have to agree. The Omega Lambda Chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi, Georgetown’s business fraternity, replaced the original pre-professional Delta Sigma Pi in 2006.
AKPsi, now entering its sixth year of operation with over 90 members, focuses on preparing students across all the schools for careers in business. According to the fraternity’s website, the Georgetown chapter strives to teach its brothers (gender-specific only in name) life skills through teamwork, communication and the bonds of brotherhood.
Those types of goals seem to find common ground in the university’s Greek community. Unlike fraternities at other schools, which often develop more of a party reputation than a professional one, some Greek organizations here seem more driven by the virtues than the vices.
“At Georgetown, you get all the good aspects of being in a fraternity — the bonds, the brotherhood, the professional aspect,” Steele says.
 
FRATS AND THE FUTURE
At the heart of Georgetown’s informal Greek system is the desire to prepare students for their adult lives, professional or otherwise. Brothers and sisters never fail to acknowledge the positive influence that a tight campus network has on their experience as an undergraduate — and as a prospect in the job market.
After only two weeks as an AEPi pledge, Hochberg can already identify the benefits that he assumes will come his way.
“The secret is, if you want to go into banking, you have to start at AEPi,” he jokes.
Hochberg is certainly on the right page. AEPi’s extensive alumni network gives brothers contacts across the country to help them find work after graduation. Lowell Karr (MSB ’11), former president of AEPi, believes that this opportunity is an invaluable advantage for members of the brotherhood.
“AEPi is a fraternity, and the biggest impact on your life is as a student, but after you graduate you’re part of a massive network. We’re talking tens of thousands of people across the globe today who are brothers of AEPi.”
At the same time, this support system also helps younger brothers to navigate the ins and outs of their new Georgetown life. Evan Karr (SFS ’12) and Lance Pauker (COL ’12), now seniors, both remembered times that this undergraduate network worked in their favor.
“No matter what you’re doing, there’s usually an older brother who’s done it. You know, if you’re taking a certain class or applying for a job, there’s someone who’s been there and is willing to help,” says Evan, who connected with AEPi through his brother Lowell.
“As a senior, it’s really interesting that we have the opportunity to shape younger brothers’ college experiences for the better,” remarks Pauker.
Those new brothers, now in their third week of pledging, already can barely remember a time when they didn’t know about fraternities at Georgetown.
“It’s not something I have to do. It’s something I want to do, and I’m glad I did it,” says Hochberg.
For him, “fraternity” has become more than a scene out of “Animal House.”
“Yeah, I’m in a frat, but it’s not what you think. It’s a little bit of what you think, but not in any of those negative ways. It’s ‘fraternity’ in the lasting brotherhood and community aspects.”

Reported crime on-campus began to decline in 2010, but alcohol violtions jumped 30 percent in the same period, according to the Department of Public Safety’s 2010 Crime Awareness and Campus Security Report.
The report listed a total of 477 alcohol violations in the 2010 calendar year, a significant increase from the 334 incidents reported in 2009.
This jump comes after the number of alcohol violations had dropped 50 percent from 2007 to 2009. At the time, the university attributed the decline to a stricter alcohol policy implemented in 2007.
“This downward trend may be attributed to measures that the university has taken to curtail excessive drinking,” Joseph Smith, associate director of DPS, wrote in an email to The Hoya last year.
The new policy included a requirement that students to undergo training before holding weekend parties and register them by Thursday night. Parties in townhouses and apartments were also limited to 25 and 35 people.
The policy was amended in fall 2008 in response to strong student protests and now includes a clarification of the Code of Student Conduct.
The reason for the increase in 2010 is unclear, as resident assistants did not increase patrols, Director of Residence Life Stephanie Lynch said last year.
Alcohol violations make up a large chunk of Category A infractions, detailed by the Student Code of Conduct, and were barely outnumbered by the 481 noise violations reported in 2010. These offenses can include the possession or consumption of alcohol in an alcohol-free location, possession of an unauthorized keg and possession or use of alcohol-related paraphernalia. Drug violations accounted for the remaining 41 infractions in this category. These violations can be punished by housing relocation, housing probation or suspension and disciplinary probation or a suspension of up to two years, according to the Code of Student Conduct.
In total, there were 220 on-campus crimes in 2010, including eight forcible sexual offences, 38 burglaries and one aggravated assault. The 2010 data marked a decrease from the 282 reported crimes in 2009.
Category B violations, which are more severe in nature, include harassment, theft and sexual misconduct. Of the 48 Category B violations reported last year, disorderly conduct was the most common, with a total of nine reported incidents.
The Crime Awareness and Campus Security report, released in conjunction with the Fire and Safety Report and Fire Log, highlights the crime and safety policies of the university and lists crime statistics from the previous calendar year. These reports are issued annually in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Act, which requires universities that participate in federal financial aid programs to disclose information about crime and related campus policies.
Assistant Vice President for Communications Stacy Kerr said that the annual reports help to promote safety practices on the Hilltop.
“This report is one of the university’s many efforts to communicate with our community about personal safety,” she said.
DPS and the Office of Student Conduct could not be reached for comment.

Last week, the University of New Hampshire instituted a campus-wide ban on sales of all energy drinks. Though the ban was repealed within hours by UNH President MarkHuddleston, the policy has sparked conversation about college students’ dependence on these products.
“In this case, I am personally aware of conflicting reports about the caffeine and sugar content of some of these beverages, and I want to be sure we respect our students’ ability to make informed choices about what they consume,” Huddleston said.
At Georgetown, the sale and consumption of energy drinks at Hoya Snaxa and Vital Vittles remains sizeable.
According to figures provided by The Corp management, the organization sold 301 total energy drinks in the week of Sept. 16 through Sept. 22. Friday and Thursday ranked as the highest-selling days, with 23 and 19 percent of the week’s total sold on these days, respectively.
Of the five brands sold by The Corp, Red Bull and Monster are the most popular, representing 45 and 31 percent of the total number of energy drinks sold.
Richard Weiner (MSB ’15) said he uses “5-Hour ENERGY” drinks four to five nights per month.
“I tend to procrastinate, which creates the need for last-minute work and all-nighters,” he said. Weiner prefers 5-Hour ENERGY over other brands because the “crash” following consumption is not as severe as with other brands.
In November of last year, a research team led by John Higgins at the University of Texas Health Science Center warned that certain susceptible people who drink these caffeine-rich drinks risk dangerous and even life-threatening effects on blood pressure, heart rate and brain function.
The researchers explained that the caffeinated drinks were linked to four instances of death and five of seizures.
Brands like 5-Hour ENERGY refute the arguments against their products.
“While some studies show that caffeine may result in a short-term increase of blood pressure, 5-Hour ENERGY has not been proven to increase blood pressure, let alone to dangerous levels,” the company wrote on its++ website.
Mark Stern (COL ’13) drinks four cups of coffee each day but said that he avoids energy drinks because of their dubious health effects.
“Energy drinks are filled with sugar, artificial sweeteners and weird chemicals.  I don’t want to drink that stuff,” he said.

Activist and filmmaker Michael Moore, infamous for his irreverent take on popular controversies, tackled politics and student activism in Gaston Hall Friday.
Despite discussing heavy issues such as the national debt and health care, Moore set a casual tone for the packed afternoon lecture with his own attire, sporting a green baseball hat, plain T-shirt, jeans and sneakers.
The famous activist centered his talk, which was sponsored by the Lecture Fund, on the importance of student activism and how he first got involved in the issues on which he focuses his films.
Moore threaded Christian references throughout his talk while commenting on his spiritual upbringing. As a Catholic himself, he cited the influence anti-war activists Philip Berrigan and Fr. Daniel Berrigan, S.J., had on his interest in the priesthood. Moore attended seminary for a year, but he eventually left to pursue a different path.
“Jesuits have always had a social conscience. … I think this country is fortunate to have a number of Jesuit colleges,” Moore told The Hoya after the event. “Georgetown is one of the great institutions in this country. There are people have gone here who have gone on to do tremendous good and there are people who’ve gone here who’ve gone on to do tremendous evil — like most great institutions.”
Moore attended University of Michigan-Flint, majoring in political science and theater. However, he also chose to leave college after a year of enrollment.
“I enjoyed school,” Moore said in his speech. “But I was bored of it all.”
Not shying away from controversial topics, such as a strong re-evaluation of the capitalist system, Moore encouraged dialogue during his visit, urging conservative students to ask questions during the question and answer session.
“We all agree on more things than we disagree on, and we never really talk about that,” Moore said in an interview with The Hoya.
He recounted an episode featured in his autobiography, “Here Comes Trouble,” in which he highlighted the type of authority figures who galvanized him to run for school board and begin his life as political activist.  For Moore, after seeing a student stopped from walking during his high school graduation ceremony, something snapped.
“That changed me for the rest of my life,” Moore said. “I couldn’t live with myself like that, that I just let that happen, that I didn’t say anything. It was a small thing, but it really affected me and I haven’t shut up since.”
Reinforcing the importance of voicing one’s opinions, Moore identified an earlier experience when he won a competition for giving a speech about racial discrimination.
“I don’t think you have to do a lot, just a little bit,” Moore said, addressing how students can get involved in social justice. “Don’t turn your head the other way.”
Students in attendance were impressed by Moore’s openness to student opinions and personal approach to controversies, which was more relaxed than in his films.
“I think that he came across as much less of an extremist than he is often made out to be,” Melissa Miller (COL ’12) said. “He seemed passionate and liberal, but not the foaming nutcase that he often is made to seem. In general, I thought it was a cool opportunity to hear such a prominent public voice speak on the issues of the day.”
When asked about the amount of activism he sees present in the younger generation today, Moore responded that he felt youth engagement often occurs but goes unreported.
“I think there’s actually a lot of activism, but the press just doesn’t cover it,” Moore said. “You made Obama happen. Obama wouldn’t have been elected without young people. He lost every other white age group except 18 [through] 29.”
Throughout the talk, he continually emphasized the overarching theme of the power of youth.
“Most stuff happens because of young people,” Moore said. “All through history, it’s young people that are out there doing it [and] making it happen. That just has to continue.”
