The 20th annual Rangila dance show will be held at the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts on Nov. 22 as a result of structural problems in the show’s usual venue, Gaston Hall.
The coordinators of the cultural dance performance, which is put on by the South Asian Society and will feature around 500 student dancers, officially signed a contract with the Kennedy Center last Friday.
Last month, The Office of Planning and Facilities Management performed an engineering analysis on Gaston Hall’s stage and found it to be structurally unsound for groups of over 45 people. Renovations will occur on the stage this summer.
Event coordinators Alisha Datwani (MSB ’15) and Medha Chandorkar (COL ’15) said that after discovering that Gaston Hall was no longer an option for the performance, they met with the Center for Student Engagement and the Office of the President to brainstorm venues.
“As soon as we found out that we didn’t have Gaston, we called a meeting with the South Asian Society board and we all collaboratively came up with every single option in the general vicinity of Georgetown as to where we could hold Rangila,” Datwani said.
Rangila Master of Ceremony Priya Sharma (MSB ’15) said that the sudden announcement regarding Gaston’s condition worried many performers and choreographers.
“The second you take away Gaston Hall, that’s at the core of what Rangila is, it’s a tradition,” Sharma said. “People are excited to perform in such a a prestigious hall. So when you say it’s not going to be there because the stage is not ‘structurally sound’— that was the phrase continuously used — people were anxious,” Sharma said.
After considering numerous options, the Office of the President helped SAS secure the Kennedy Center. According to the University President John J. DeGioia’s Chief of Staff Joe Ferrara, the office’s past collaboration with the Kennedy Center on events like “Let Freedom Ring!” for Martin Luther King Jr. Day and the “Faith, Culture and the Common Good” conference, which the university co-hosted with the Vatican’s Pontifical Council for Culture and the Archdiocese of Washington, made this agreement feasible.
“As a result of our relationship with the Kennedy Center and an opening in their performance calendar, we had the opportunity to host this event there this year,” Ferrara wrote in an email. “We are excited for Rangila to celebrate its 20th anniversary with a performance at a venue that is such an important part of the community.”
Chandorkar said that this year will most likely be the only time that Rangila will be held in the Kennedy Center.
“We are all going to sit down and look at what Rangila will look like in the future. The Kennedy Center just frankly isn’t a realistic option for a year-to-year basis but we have confidence that going on from here it’s going to get better and better,” Chandorkar said.
Datwani and Chandorkar said that although the venue has changed, they are striving to maintain the energy and spirit of a Georgetown tradition.
“Even though it’s an amazing opportunity and an amazing venue, we didn’t want to compromise so much that it didn’t become Rangila,” Vasant said. “We kept that mind throughout the process. Really there aren’t too many things changing other than the fact that Gaston was never built for a dance performance so to have a stage with a full light array and space, it’s really fantastic to be on a stage that was made to dance on.”
Choreographer Matthew Chan (COL ’15) said that although he will miss Gaston Hall, he is eager to perform at a world-famous venue.
“There is some sentimentality attached to Gaston because it’s something so intrinsically Georgetown, but when you think about D.C. in general, the Kennedy Center is the place to be,” Chan said. “When you think about the East Coast and you think about where is the biggest stage you can perform ever, the Kennedy Center is right up there. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”
One major change to the usual two-show Rangila performance is that it will now be held on only one night. The Kennedy Center fits 2,300 to Gaston Hall’s 800, and Chandorkar said they predict the sale of 1,800 tickets for the single performance. Some of those tickets have been reserved for alumni, dignitaries, faculty, staff and families of performers.
“We are allocating to more family coming, more faculty and staff coming,” Datwani said. “Students who never get tickets will definitely get tickets this year.”
The extra 500 seats will serve as a waiting area for student dancers who want to watch their peers perform.
“Every year in Gaston, dancers who were waiting to dance go line up in the back and just watch the show unofficially and stand the whole time, but it’s very inconvenient,” Chandorkar said. “This year obviously Kennedy Center won’t allow that, so the top tier of seats — about 400 seats — are all reserved for dancers. So anyone who’s not in the wings waiting or on stage dancing can grab a seat and catch the show.”
Tickets to the performance have increased from $15 to $20, and Datwani said that they ensured that prices stayed low to allow all members of the community to attend the event.
“We personally feel like we stepped up the quality of the show this year and at the end of the day we are a student production, there was no way we were going to charge more than that,” she said.
The larger stage at the Kennedy Center has prompted choreography changes that will allow dancers to spread out, according to Datwani.
“We told them immediately after we knew that we didn’t have Gaston: ‘Plan for a bigger space,’” Datwani said. “What that means in terms of general formations and transitions: Formations can be bigger, better. The problem with Gaston is there is very little depth so finales look a little clustered and formations look flattened. So we told them to work with more space.”
The event will raise awareness for the Pritam Spiritual Foundation, a group based in Kashmir, India that provides medical aid for those injured by land mines.
“It’s amazing work not being done by any other group and we thought the interfaith aspect really fit into the Jesuit values of Georgetown, and their mission really aligns with Jesuit values, Georgetown values and Rangila as well,” Vasant said. “We love their work and we really want to support them and this year their funding was cut by 50 percent because the Indian army pulled all their funding. We wanted to step up and help them out.”
In honor of Rangila’s 20th anniversary, its theme this year is “A Story of Time Travel.”
The sheer size of the new venue has led to a few nerves for those set to perform before a sold-out house of 2,300 audience members and fellow performers.
“My reaction was ‘What have I gotten myself into?’ I thought I was going to be on stage with my [fellow MC Jimmy Ramirez (COL ’15)] in front of Gaston Hall, and now it’s 2,300,” Sharma said. “This number is very much ingrained in my mind. For me, it’s daunting.”

California State Senate candidate Sandra Fluke (LAW ’12) lost her race in the state’s 26th District to fellow Democrat and longtime area resident Ben Allen on Tuesday.
Fluke received 39 percent of the vote in the runoff election, which pitted the two Democrats against each other as part of California’s “jungle primary” rules, in which the top two finishers in the primary election, regardless of party, face off in the general election. Her large margin of defeat comes in stark contrast to her close second-place finish in the June primary and her fundraising advantage over Allen throughout the campaign.
Fluke gained national recognition after testifying in 2012 in front of Congress about the Affordable Care Act’s birth control mandate, urging Georgetown University to cover the co-pay for female students’ contraceptives, which it did not do until August 2012. Conservative radio show host Rush Limbaugh called Fluke a “slut” in response to her testimony, drawing widespread criticism for his comments.
Fluke continued to stand up for women’s rights after the incident, and spoke on the role of women at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. She originally contemplated a run for the retiring Rep. Henry Waxman’s (D-Calif.) seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.
H*yas for Choice President Abby Grace (SFS ’16) attributed Fluke’s candidacy and primary success to the positive national attention she received for standing up for women’s needs.
“The positive media reaction afterward, reporting her and using that as a larger platform to call out not only Rush Limbaugh but other Republican commentators increased her name ID to where she was even able to run in the first place,” Grace said.
Jenna Galper (COL ’17), who interned on Fluke’s campaign over the summer, said the atmosphere of Fluke’s campaign was primarily positive.
“I think people were really optimistic and very hopeful. I mean, she did have a lot of momentum behind her,” Galper said. “So I think, at least from the perspective I got, that people were expecting her not only to not lose by a large margin but actually to win.”
Despite the positive attention, the race proved to be difficult for the 33-year-old Fluke, facing Allen, 36, who already served on the Board of Education in the 26th District, a coastal district encompassing affluent areas like Santa Monica, Palos Verdes, Manhattan Beach, Brentwood and Beverly Hills, after redistricting. Fluke, who received her bachelor’s degree from Cornell University, is a Pennsylvania native. She moved to West Hollywood with her husband in 2012.
Government Department Chair and American government professor Michael Bailey attributed Fluke’s loss to her reputation as being solely a “women’s issues” candidate.
“I would say being a young woman whose signature issue is women’s issues, then the politics of it seem to me that she would really have to work to figure out a way to have something else,” Bailey said. “It’s not that ‘She’s a young woman, so I’m voting against her,’ but if she were a young man who had the same policy platform, she probably wouldn’t have had to worry about that same kind of pigeonholing.”
Grace noted that Fluke’s attempts to address other issues contributed to the perception of her as an unqualified candidate.
“A lot of times it’s easy when you see young ambitious men running for office to say they’re go-getters, they’re making a name for themselves. But when women perceive the same actions, a lot of times they’re perceived as overly efficient, unqualified, unprepared,” Grace said. “She was forced to talk about other issues like energy and the environment, which are certainly important issues, but I think that perhaps that moved her a bit out of her comfort zone.”
Since Fluke’s campaign was more associated with national politics than her opponent’s, Bailey hypothesized that the dissatisfaction with Democrats in Congress may have diffused into the race.
“The general story is this anti-Democratic movement that emerged when things got coupled up with the national politics,” Bailey said.
Grace felt confident that Fluke would run again in the future.
“I definitely think that she’ll run again in her life. There’s a lot to be said for lessons that you learn on the first campaign trail. She still has a good bit of time, and she is very passionate about political activism in general, and if you really have that drive, one setback isn’t going to knock you down,” Grace said.
Galper agreed.
“It’s always disappointing to see young women lose running for office. But she’s still young, and I think she has a promising career ahead of her,” she said.
Fluke’s campaign could not be reached for comment.

Since his ignominious August 2013 dismissal from the position of live bulldog mascot, Jack Jr. has made a smooth transition into a private home in the Washington, D.C. area, while still maintaining his joie de vivre.
The university chose to remove the year-old puppy, who served as the university’s sixth bulldog mascot, after a settlement with parents whose child was bitten by J.J. in fall 2012, shortly after his arrival on campus. J.J. took over from the retiring Jack the Bulldog at the end of the 2012-2013 basketball season.
Fr. Christopher Steck, S.J., who cared for the puppy in New South Hall, received over 100 applications from families eager to adopt J.J. After 15 home visits, Steck picked the Stoner family, who live in the Washington, D.C. area.
John Stoner said that J.J. has become a much happier dog in a home environment.
“I know he loved being the mascot, but it was also kind of complicated for him,” Stoner said. “There were so many things that went on and it was really just a difficult thing and he’s adjusted really well.”
During the selection process last summer, Steck identified certain requirements for J.J.’s new home. These requirements included a family who had experience raising disciplined dogs, lived locally, had at least one adult who is at home regularly and did not have any dogs that would not get along with J.J. Students did not participate in the search process.
According to Stoner, J.J. is well-adjusted and well-loved in his new home, where he has lived for about a year.
“In a lot of ways the situation he was in when we adopted him was just unfortunate,” Stoner said. “He’s a rambunctious little boy. He’s two now but he’s very, very high-spirited. He really is a fun dog to be around. He’s very loyal. He’s got an incredible personality. He really is a funny little dog.”
Stoner, who has owned bulldogs previously, said that his family worked with J.J. to develop a method to minimize behavioral problems.
“He’s fallen into a routine,” Stoner said. “He has become so chill, so calm and fun to be around that the transition for him has been one where he feels really happy. I think he really loves being here with us.”
According to Stoner, J.J. has also become a bit of a local celebrity when on walks in the Georgetown area.
“People recognize him when we walk him,” Stoner said. “People always remark about him what a great-looking dog [he is] and they say, ‘Isn’t he cool?’ [He is] very gifted physically, quite powerful and quite strong. He is just absolutely so much fun to have around. He is just a very happy little boy and he has so much personality.”
John B. Carroll, J.J.’s replacement, arrived on campus last October, assuming the Jack the Bulldog mantle. The Bulldog Advisory Committee sought to create consistency in the new mascot’s training by cutting the Jack Crew, who care for the bulldog, from approximately 20 members to just six.
Steck said he occasionally visits J.J. and is pleased with his owners and home environment.
“His new parents adore him,” Steck, who remains the caretaker of the retired Jack, wrote in an email. “When I’ve visited him, he’s displayed the same energetic and affectionate personality; he doesn’t seem to have an off switch. … I am delighted that he has made the transition so smoothly.”
According to Steck, J.J.’s rambunctious personality has not faded, and he still maintains his puppy-like charm.
“He also still loves watching sports on TV — he watches the ball go back and forth, waiting for it to get in reach — it’s hilarious,” Steck wrote. “Like Jack Sr., he loves tearing apart boxes.  He is very smart, especially for a bulldog, and will try to get away with things if he can.”
Neve Schadler (COL ’15), the longest serving member of the Jack Crew and its former head, said that while she enjoyed working with J.J., she is happy that he is now in a good home.
“Having the honor of taking care of all three mascots has been a highlight of my Georgetown experience,” Schadler said. “I loved working with J.J. while he was the mascot-in-training and I am so glad that he is with a family that loves and cares for him.”

Early applicants to Georgetown’s Class of 2019 changed demographically along with national trends, while the competitiveness of the applicant pool increased and the breakdown of applications between undergraduate schools stayed stable.
Early action applications, which are non-binding, were due Nov. 1. This first round of applications precedes regular decision applications, which are due Jan. 10, 2015.
This year’s early admissions pool saw a rise in Hispanic applicants and a decrease in non-Hispanic white applicants, in accordance with national trends.
This year, 4,454 students who identified themselves as white applied, a decrease from the 4,527 who applied last year. With this decrease in white applicants came an increase in applicants who identified as African-American, rising from 571 last year to 582 applicants this year; Asian-American, which rose from 896 to 912 applicants this year; and Hispanic-American, which rose the most, from 750 to 790 applicants this year.
Director of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon attributed this change, a demographic trend since 2011, to the rising number of Hispanic high school graduates and decreasing number of white high school graduates. According to a report by the Western Interstate Commission of Higher Education, after rising between 1996 and 2011, the total number of high school graduates has since begun to decline.
“The number of people applying [to four-year colleges] is going down, and it’s shifting away from people who have traditionally been most likely to apply — white Americans in particular, who’ve been the ones most likely to apply, are significantly dropping. Hispanic-Americans who have been the least likely to apply is the increasing number,” Deacon said.
With 6,827 applications received as of Nov. 6, Deacon projected that Georgetown would receive about 6,860 applications total, an all-time high for the past four years, including the trickle of excused late applications that arrive after the deadline.
Georgetown received at least two applications from all 50 states in this early round, and 516 applications from international addresses.
Early application numbers to the College, the School of Foreign Service and the McDonough School of Business went up this year, while applications to the School of Nursing and Health Studies saw a slight decrease from last year. Of the total early applications, 56.6 percent were for the College, 19.8 percent were for the School of Foreign Service, 17.3 percent were for the McDonough School of Business and 6.3 percent were for the School of Nursing and Health Studies. Last year, 6,850 candidates applied to the Class of 2018 – 55.6 percent to the College, 20 percent to the School of Foreign Service, 17.4 percent to the McDonough School of Business, and 6.9 percent to the School of Nursing and Health Studies.
Additionally, this year’s applicant pool boasts a more competitive academic record, with the average class rank of the schools that report at the 92.3 percentile, an increase from last’s year class rank percentile of 91.3, and a six-point increase in SAT scores.
“We’re actually, from a business point of view, slightly increasing our market share of high-ability students,” Deacon said.
Despite the more competitive applicant pool, however, Deacon said he did not foresee a decrease in the undergraduate admission rate, projected at about 17 percent regular decision and 15 percent early action, consistent with last year’s 16.6 combined overall admission rate.
“The more competitive the pool is, the harder it is to yield them, because the more likely that we come in contact with the top schools with them,” Deacon said.
Deacon said that Georgetown’s ability to maintain a roughly stable number of early action applications over the past four years, despite the declining number of high school graduates, reflects positively on the school’s admissions numbers.
“Even though these are small, little changes, they actually do reflect the national trends, and we’re actually doing pretty well,” Deacon said.

I’m sure that, given the increase in the application pool’s academic competitiveness, we should see at least a corresponding 1-2% increase in average GPA. I’m also sure that this will then be called grade inflation by administrators who focus more on testing students with arbitrary grade deflationary hoops like the econ grade cap than they care about educating us.

Voters in the District of Columbia passed Initiative 71 on Tuesday, voting to legalize the possession of recreational marijuana. The ballot measure, which was supported by 69 percent of voters, will now move to a congressional review period before implementation by the D.C. Council.
Initiative 71 allows individuals over 21 to possess up to two ounces of marijuana and cultivate as many as six plants, as long as only three or fewer are mature. The legislation does not allow the sale of recreational marijuana, but individuals may freely give up to one ounce of the substance and sell or use marijuana paraphernalia. D.C.’s marijuana initiative does not put a tax system in place, since voters are not allowed to directly establish a tax system.
Residents voted Tuesday to legalize marijuana in Oregon and Alaska as well.
The initiative was widely expected to pass, though a recent Washington City Paper poll placed support for legalization at 52 percent, much lower than eventual voter support.
“There are no perfect answers to people’s legitimate concerns about marijuana use. But neither are there such answers about tobacco or alcohol, and we believe that on every level — the health effects, the impact on society and law-and-order issues — the balance falls squarely on the side of national legalization,” the New York Times editorial board wrote in its endorsement of the initiative.
In accordance with the D.C. Home Rule Act of 1973, the legislation is subject to a 60-day congressional review period. If Congress chooses not to act, the bill will become law. However, Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) and other congressmen have already expressed their intent to block the initiative.
“Actions by those in D.C. will result in higher drug use among teens,” Harris said in a written statement to The Washington Post. “I will consider using all resources available to a member of Congress to stop this action.”
To do so, Congress would have to pass a resolution rejecting the initiative, which would then require the president’s signature. After D.C. voters passed legislation legalizing medical marijuana in 1998, Congress delayed its implementation until 2009.
After the initiative’s passage, around 70 activists, campaigners and supporters gathered at the Meridian Pint Bar to celebrate legalization in the District by drinking local beer in support of D.C. charities.
D.C. Cannabis Campaign Press Officer Zack Pesavento (SFS ’08) noted that while D.C. was on the forefront of marijuana policy initiatives, ensuring that the bill passes through Congress remains a major hurdle.
“I think that the District of Columbia is really moving the conversation forward on marijuana legalization,” Pesavento said. “We still need to make sure that Congress doesn’t interfere with the bill. If there’s no interference we could see the initiative’s visions go into effect as soon as April. That means by about this time next year we could start seeing the first legal crop of marijuana in the District of Columbia.”
Cannabis Campaign Chair Adam Edinger, who proposed Initiative 71 to the D.C. Council, was enthusiastic about the results and did not see Congress as likely to interfere.
“This is a big day for justice, we’re ending marijuana arrests once and for all,” Edinger said. “I don’t think there will be any problems with [congressional review].”
Since the bill does not allow for the sale of marijuana, the D.C. Council will write a bill governing taxation and regulation, but will only be able to do so following congressional review. The council already passed legislation Oct. 28 to seal the criminal records of D.C. residents who have been convicted of non-violent marijuana-related crimes, and Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large) introduced legislation to start the regulation process at the end of October.
“I know Councilman Grosso wants to have stores open in under 12 months, he’s shooting for nine months,” Vanessa West, manager of the Metropolitan Wellness Center, a D.C. medical marijuana dispensary, said. “But that sounds like an overshot in my opinion.”
West was glad to see the bill pass, but she was skeptical that the legislation would pass anytime soon.
“I am very cynical when it comes to legislation going through congressional review,” she said. “I know that when anything dealing with marijuana, abortion or guns, anything dealing with those three things in the District of Columbia, typically congressional Republicans tend to object.”
Will Jones III, founder of anti-legalization group Two Is Enough D.C., felt his group gave its best effort in opposing Initiative 71, but still worried about the impact of the legislation on the District’s society.
“We did as much as we could, we went to community meetings, we spoke with individuals, we handed out fliers,” Jones said. “We still believe the same thing — that if it goes into effect it’s going to have a devastating impact on the city, particularly on the African-American community.”
Jones said that the group will not disband, as TIE D.C. plans on opposing the taxation and regulation bill in the D.C. Council but will not take an official position on the congressional review because of its implications for D.C. home rule.
“We’re just going to work to minimize the impact of the passage of the legislation in our communities, that’s really why we’re out here, just out of genuine concern. There’s no one on our team who thinks that marijuana is some moral, terrible evil,” he said.
Both people for and against Initiative 71 saw the issue as having racial repercussions. Jones feared that marijuana would be advertised and sold to poor minority communities, pointing to a Washington Post poll before the election that showed support from blacks at 56 percent, compared to 74 percent from white voters.
“We’re still quite confident that in a lot of the poor and minority communities this is not what we want,” he said.
Pesavento disagreed, pointing to discrimination in criminal justice enforcement as creating divisions between races.
“I think voters in other states have already made the case about it being an issue of personal freedom, but I think we also made the case here that it’s also a civil rights issue, because we’ve seen not only a historical legacy of discriminatory enforcement of marijuana prohibition. But even under the decriminalization law we were still seeing the majority of tickets being issued in neighborhoods that are traditionally home to communities of color,” Pesavento said.
Students were generally supportive of the legislation as well. Bryan Doremus (COL ’15) supported the passage of the initiative based on its criminal justice effects.
“I think it’s a great move forward,” Doremus said. “I think it will get rid of a lot of biases in the justice system, especially in D.C.”

It is great that people will be able to smoke and buy pot. However the main question is who will be able to sell the pot. A few privilege Jews and whites permitted to sell drugs to pot heads and poor people is not the way to go with regulating pot. DC should have a very open and transparent system in licensing for dispensaries.

Gaston Hall’s stage can no longer support large groups of performers, like those in Rangila, and will undergo construction this summer, after an engineering analysis conducted recently found structural problems with the platform.
According to the Office of the President’s Chief of Staff Joseph Ferrara, the engineers who evaluated the space said that the stage is not structurally sound for groups of over 45 people. The first consequence of this analysis will be the relocation of the South Asian Society’s Rangila dance show from its traditional Gaston performance to the Kennedy Center this weekend.
“Most events could continue as planned with two important restrictions,” Ferrara wrote in an email. “First, we should not do an event with more than 45 people on the stage at the same time. Second, we should not do an event that involves a lot of dancing, jumping and stomping on the stage.”
The engineers’ study was prompted after last November’s Rangila performance, in which people noticed the stage flexing and pieces of plaster falling into the Philodemic Room below. Rangila has been held for 19 years on Gaston’s stage.
“Gaston stage was built on the floor and as it turns out, the floor structure which was built 107 years ago does not accommodate the activities that have been on Gaston’s stage,” Vice President for Planning and Facilities Robin Morey said.
According to Morey, the structural problems will be fixed by next fall to accommodate larger productions. Construction, which will take place over the summer, will include disassembling the stage and rebuilding it so that the impact of heavy loads will be better supported.
“[This is] a safety interim measure and we’re doing a design now to strengthen up the stage so we can have those events there,” Morey wrote. “I think it’s affected a very small number of events and obviously Rangila’s the big one and we’re looking at doing the construction to minimize the impact the summer of 2015.”
The new limits on the types of events that Gaston Hall can accommodate have also impacted Groove Theory, which will not be able to hold its showcase in Gaston this year. The event will instead take place in the Lohrfink Auditorium.
According to Groove Theory Director of Communications Camille Squires  (COL ’15), the group was able to perform in Gaston during the Mr. Georgetown pageant Oct. 24 without any issues.
Squires expressed frustration with Groove Theory’s inability to hold its event in Gaston this year, in light of the fact that it encountered no issues during the Mr. Georgetown performance.
“I guess we’re just kind of dealing with the situation as it is. On one hand, we understand that the structural issue is no one’s fault, but at the same time, we’re frustrated by the lack of communication around it and perhaps the lack of communication around solutions,” she said.
While participants in the Homecoming Weekend Mr. Georgetown pageant, who also put on a dance number, did not experience any immediate trouble with the stage, they did have to change their acts somewhat to accommodate these new stipulations.
“We were warned not to do anything too crazy on [the stage],” David Edgar (SFS ’15), who participated in the pageant as Mr. Capitol Gs, said.
The problems in Gaston Hall have not affected more typical events, like those of the Georgetown University Lecture Fund.
“We’ve had no problems using Gaston Hall this semester. It continues to be a very special place to hold lectures,” Lecture Fund Chair Marcus Stromeyer (SFS ’15) wrote in an email.

After the dust settled following Tuesday’s midterm elections, incumbent Georgetown alumni retained their seats in the House of Representatives and the Senate, though challengers and gubernatorial candidates were less successful.
Democrat Deborah Dingell (SFS ’75, GRD ’98) made history in Michigan’s 12th Congressional District as the first woman to be elected to the seat of a living, retired husband. Dingell succeeds John Dingell (COL ’49, LAW ’52), who has served in the House since 1955, the longest uninterrupted tenure in congressional history. With John Dingell’s father, John Dingell Sr., serving as representative before his son, a member of the Dingell family has continually held the district’s seat since 1933. Dingell defeated her Republican challenger Terry Bowman in a landslide, winning more than 65 percent of the vote.
Dingell said the lengthy history of the Dingell family in Michigan’s 12th District would not make her complacent in her term in office.
“I don’t look at the length of service. I had a giant job interview with the people of the 12th Congressional District. They hired me on Tuesday night,” Dingell told The Hoya. “Every two years when there is an election, I am accountable to my employers. I’m going to work hard to deliver for them what they want me to deliver.”
Throughout her campaign, Dingell emphasized job creation, health care and affordable education. She said these goals remain priorities, even with the Republican majority.
“I have been very clear from the beginning that I was going to reach across the aisle, that I wasn’t going to Washington to pick fights, but to work through solutions,” Dingell said.
Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin (SFS ’66, LAW ’69), the only Georgetown alum in the Senate up for re-election, won a fourth term in office with 53 percent of the vote, defeating Republican challenger Jim Oberweis. Durbin served as the Senate majority whip since 2007 but must relinquish the position after Republicans gained the majority in the chamber on Tuesday.
Georgetown University government professor Mark Rom pointed to Durbin’s visit to Georgetown last fall to address students in Gaston Hall on immigration reform as an example of his character and an indication of why he continues to be re-elected, calling him charismatic, smart and hardworking.
“The students were really appreciative of the work he does, but it was also clear that he loves Georgetown,” Rom said. “He’s not going to overlook his constituencies. Sometimes members of Congress grow distant, but he’s not one of those guys. He’ll take care of the folks back home.”
Hakeem Jeffries (GRD ’94), who was first elected to the House in 2012, won New York’s 8th Congressional District in Brooklyn and Queens, with 91 percent of the vote. Rom, who taught Jeffries, praised his work ethic. Rom said that the overwhelming margin indicated that the congressman was popular enough to keep the seat for life if he desired it.
“It makes people believe that you’re on their side, but also that you’re going to be confident on their side. This guy is going to do what he says and he’s going to be good at it,” Rom said.
While Nick Troiano (COL ’11, GRD ’13) lost his race for Pennsylvania’s 10th Congressional District to incumbent Tom Marino, the 25-year- old independent candidate still earned 13 percent of the vote. Troiano finished with 45 percent of the vote in his hometown of Milford and was the first independent candidate to even make the ballot in the history of the 10th District.
In an email to The Hoya, Troiano wrote that he does not see himself running again in two years, but left the possibility open for future elections. In the meantime, he explained that he will spend the coming months focusing on how else he can further his ideas of political and fiscal reform, adding that he hopes more independent candidates would run in 2016.
“I think such a slate of candidates, improving on the model we demonstrated this year, can really shake up politics and catalyze a broader millennial reform movement. I am working with a few others to help create the infrastructure to support this idea,” he wrote.
Troiano ran his campaign under the motto, “American Deserves Better,” criticizing the partisan divide currently plaguing the nation. He remained firm in his independent status after the election, urging at least one of the major parties to take serious steps to reform these political processes.
“Our two-party system only works when both parties work together, and right now they are both failing. That’s partially why independents are the largest and fastest growing segment of the electorate, especially among young people,” Troiano wrote.
Rom, who remembers Troiano’s time as a student, said his intelligence and ambition is undeniable and believes Troiano will remain engaged in political life for years to come.
“He probably got the 13 percent just based on his hustle, his charm and his intelligence,” Rom said. “I’ve had a number of conversations with him and I’m really quite fond of him. I think he’s an impressive guy.”
The multitude of Democratic losses around the country included gubernatorial defeats in Illinois and Wisconsin. Less successful campaigns included two Democratic gubernatorial losses from incumbent Pat Quinn (SFS ’71) of Illinois and Mary Burke (GSB ’81) of Wisconsin.
Quinn, a former sports editor of The Hoya, who had served as governor of Illinois since former governor Rod Blagojevich was removed from office on corruption charges in January 2009, was narrowly defeated by Republican challenger Bruce Rauner, who received just over 50 percent of the vote, to Quinn’s 46 percent.
Although multiple media outlets projected Rauner the victor late Tuesday evening, Quinn refused to concede until late Wednesday afternoon. He maintained he would follow through with his campaign promise of raising the minimum wage in his remaining months in office.
“We respect the results. We respect what the voters did yesterday. I look forward to working with the new administration,” Quinn said in a statement.
In Wisconsin, Burke, who received 47 percent of the vote, failed to unseat incumbent Republican Governor Scott Walker, who earned 52 percent of the vote. Burke’s business-heavy background includes former positions as an executive at Trek Bicycle Corporation and Wisconsin Secretary of Commerce.
Rom attributed both losses to the impact of voter dissatisfaction with President Barack Obama and the entire Democratic Party.
“Voters are unhappy with him both for his performance, but also now for what he stands for,” he said. “He’s the leading symbol of Washington’s dysfunction and of the country being stuck in a rut in some ways. It’s the most important issue on the campaign, beating everything else.”
Two days after the election, 20 races still remain unresolved, including the effort of incumbent Maryland Democrat John Delaney (LAW ’88) to remain the representative of Maryland’s 6th District to the House of Representatives. Although Delaney currently leads by 2,000 votes and declared victory Wednesday, the western Maryland race against Republican challenger Daniel Bongino will hinge upon the count of absentee ballots.
As of Nov. 6, with 100 percent of precincts reporting, Delaney holds 49.58 percent of the vote, and Bongino holds 48.47 percent.
In a statement released Wednesday morning, Delaney joined other Democrats adjusting to the new political reality delivered on Tuesday, and acknowledged the overall victories of the Republican Party, promising a bipartisan approach moving forward.
“Nationwide, Tuesday’s results make it clear that voters want a new approach in Washington, not more dysfunction. I’m committed to continuing to work across the aisle to create jobs and stand up for the people of the 6th District, wherever they live, whatever their party,” he said.
California State Senator Ted Lieu (LAW ’94), a Democrat, defeated opponent attorney Elan Carr, a Republican from Beverly Hills, in the congressional race to replace Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), who is retiring after serving in Congress for 40 years.
“I’m going to fight to make sure we enact strong climate change legislation. As an immigrant myself, I’m going to fight for comprehensive immigration reform. And I’m going to work every day to pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United,” Lieu said on Southern California Public Radio.
Sandra Fluke (LAW ’12) ran unsuccessfully to replace Lieu in California’s newly redistricted 26th district — Lieu currently represents the 28th.
Fifteen alumni of Georgetown University and Georgetown Law Center currently serve in the House of Representatives. After the retirement of Frank Wolf (LAW ’65, R-Va.) and Dingell’s election, that number will likely remain unchanged, depending on the too-close-to-call election of Delaney. With the re-election of Durbin, six alumni will continue to serve as senators.

Oct. 17 marked 10 years since Daniel Rigby, an MSB senior, passed away due to smoke inhalation from a fire in his townhouse on Prospect Street, triggering various efforts to improve the fire safety standards of off-campus housing for Georgetown students.
The Friends of Rigby Foundation was created in 2006 to advocate for fire safety education. The group provides educational, financial and legal support to college students for the promotion of fire safety and provides smoke detectors, fire extinguishers and fire inspections in off-campus homes and apartments.
“Our overarching goal, part of our mission statement, is that we want to be the leading fire safety campus resource for students,” Friends of Rigby Foundation President Jay Tedino (MSB ’05) said. “That’s the overachieving goal, that’s how we drive our decision-making process, and so the way we see it is there’s three main ways to tackle that.”
The foundation donates fire safety equipment to the Office of Neighborhood Life each year, according to Tedino. This year, it donated $10,000 worth of equipment, which was raised from donations, proceeds from the Run for Rigby race and the Rigby Ball.
The foundation also provides legal services for students in case of emergency and for general education.
“We are trying to make that easier through lining up the pro bono legal sources that exist, for law firms part of their mission is they have to provide some pro bono legal advice and so that can cover a whole host of issues,” Tedino said. “Georgetown has its own law school, which we’ve been speaking with and looking to make that a resource as well.”
The Georgetown Student Tenant Association has also been active in educating students about their legal rights pertaining to fire safety. GSTA board member Chloe Nalbantian (COL ’15), said that the group teaches students about Basic Business License inspections, which are readily available to all students. BBLs require an inspector to ensure its general safety, which according to GSTA Co-Director Mary Hanley (SFS ’16) is often bypassed by landlords.
“The idea is that an individual who is living in their own home would make their house safe to live in, but of course a landlord might not necessarily make a house they’re renting out as safe as possible because they’re trying to avoid costs,” Hanley wrote in an email. “Since renters don’t have the same disclosure information when choosing to rent that a homeowner would have access to when buying a home, the BBL is the stamp of approval that if you rent this house, you aren’t living in a deathtrap.”
Hanley said that GSTA helps students ensure that their home has been inspected to prevent fires like the one that took Rigby’s life.
“The reason I’m bringing this all up in the context of Rigby is because his death was completely preventable,” Hanley said. “He was in the basement and when there was a fire, he was trapped because the townhouse he was renting wasn’t compliant with safety regulations. If his property had been recently inspected and his landlord had performed all necessary repairs, Rigby very well could have survived the fire.”
Nalbantian said that it is important to get an inspection because landlords are able to renew their BBL by paying a fee and bypassing the inspection process.
“Hardly anybody knows that you can set up a free government inspection of your house to make sure it’s safe without even telling your landlord, and they will come in within a week to do it,” Nalbantian said.
GSTA has also been making efforts to expand such a network for students. When there is something legally wrong in the tenant-landlord relationship, GSTA directs students to Office of the Tenant Advocate, which helps tenants take legal action against their landlord.
“Our big worry at GSTA is that there are still students out there who are living in less than appropriate conditions and aren’t doing anything about it because they don’t know where to start,” Nalbantian said.
Nalbantian and Tedino agreed that landlords are often the root of the problem with fire safety.
“It’s more landlords than anything because you would think that they’re good, moral, ethical people or if they’re in this for the right reasons, such as, to not be a slum lord, somebody who doesn’t put money back into the house and just wants to collect a paycheck,” Tedino said.
Nalbantian said that landlords often forgo safety to avoid extra costs, leaving inexperienced students to face the consequences.
“Students aren’t exactly educated enough to know so it is the partial responsibility of the students to stay educated and know how to take steps to make sure their housing is safe. … It’s definitely not their fault that they are moving into these houses that are not safe, and they don’t know otherwise,” Nalbantian said. “There’s this pressure at Georgetown to scramble for off-campus housing and landlords take advantage of this.”
Tedino said that it is important that Rigby’s passing was not in vain and that there remains an active effort to correct a preventable situation.
“I obviously still miss him like hell; every October’s always a tough time,” Tedino said. “And you play the wondering game sometimes, where would he be right now and where would I be and part of me always wants to thank him just because even though he went in such a tragic circumstance he was still, posthumously, able to be a beacon of light.”

D.C. Councilmember Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4) won the Washington, D.C. mayoral election Tuesday, defeating opponents David Catania (SFS ’90, LAW ’94) and Carol Schwartz, both running as independents.
Bowser earned 53.96 percent of the vote, with 80,824 votes. Catania, a councilmember-at-large, came second, earning 35.31 percent of the vote and Schwartz earned 7.09 percent of the vote.
“A fifth generation Washingtonian, someone who grew up in North Michigan Park, I came home shortly after college. I dedicated my life to serving my neighbors in Riggs Park and Ward 4, in this city. I’m humbled and I’m grateful to stand here, the next mayor of my hometown,” Bowser said in her victory speech at The Howard Theatre on Tuesday night.
After beating incumbent Mayor Vincent Gray in the Democratic primary last April, Bowser has consistently held the lead in the polls throughout the campaign, holding a four-point lead over Catania in a poll conducted by D.C. pollster Ron Lester released Oct. 4.
Bowser also snagged endorsements from President Barack Obama as well as from The Washington Post.
During her campaign, Bowser has promised to produce more affordable housing, keep Chancellor of Education Kaya Henderson (SFS ’92, GRD ’07) in office and build more middle schools. Bowser reiterated these campaign goals in her victory speech.
“We believe in education reforms that guarantee every child a fair shot, that the middle class is an American right and that government has a role in getting us that. We believe in housing that is clean, safe and affordable and streets that are safe to walk at night. We believe in health care for all and marriage equality and a sustainable D.C. We believe in a level playing field for women, for African-Americans, for Latinos, and for D.C. residents of every background and belief,” Bowser said in her victory speech.
According to The Washington Post, Bowser won voters over in precincts with an income of under $100,000, and Catania won the vote in precincts with a typical income of more than $100,000. At the Georgetown Community Library precinct, the polling location for Georgetown University students, Catania won by 250 votes.
“I promise you, we’re coming to the end of the individual thank yous, because I could actually, as I look around the room, and you know who you are, how grateful I am to each of your for putting in this laboring oar in the water and trying to get us where we wanted to go,” Catania said in his concession speech Tuesday night.
Bowser will be sworn in as mayor in January 2015.

University President John J. DeGioia and the Office of Mission and Ministry will host a week of programming, beginning on Monday, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Salvadoran Martyrs, a group of Jesuits and civilians murdered by a government death squad in El Salvador.
The 1989 assassinations occurred at the University of Central America during El Salvador’s civil war, which lasted over 12 years. During the war, the Salvadoran government killed around 75,000 civilians through bombings and death squads and is implicated in many other human rights violations. The Salvadoran Martyrs — six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter — were murdered for their dissent against the Salvadoran government and work toward protecting human rights, according to Vice President of Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J.
“They were killed because they took seriously the call of the second Vatican Council in the Catholic Church, and of the Jesuits after the Council to promote a faith that does justice, to care for not only people’s spiritual needs but their material needs, to protect not only their souls but also their bodies,” O’Brien said. “They talked concretely about economics and politics, and as a result they became a part of the civil strife in their country.”
The commemoration will include a dramatic reading of the martyrs’ story, a presentation of a solidarity cross and prayer service in Red Square, an academic panel on El Salvador in the past and present and a memorial mass.
O’Brien said that the week of events will help elucidate the connections between Jesuits, universities and social justice.
“The estimate is that over 75,000 people were killed in that decade in El Salvador,” O’Brien said. “The murders of the Jesuits were just another part of that story. What we want to share is their story. This took place at a Jesuit university.”
Executive Director of the Jesuit Commons Rev. Charles Currie, S.J., said that the murder of the Salvadoran martyrs affected all Jesuit universities.
“I think the attack on the Jesuits that night was an attack on university people and the university,” Currie said. “They were trying to develop a new kind of university, deeply involved in the national reality. And I think since that time, the Jesuits had made a commitment to a faith that does justice back in 1975.”
Currie, who coordinated Georgetown’s response to the murders in 1989, worked with then University President Fr. Leo J. O’Donovan, S.J., El Salvador interest groups in D.C., The Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities and the U.S. government and State Department to help form a solution to the violence in El Salvador.
According to Currie, Georgetown and the University of Central America were linked in many ways at the time of the assassinations.
“Georgetown had had a written relationship with the university down there,” Currie said. “A couple of the Jesuits had worked with the Woodstock Center here at the university. … The president of El Salvador [Alfredo Cristiani (GSB ’68)] at the time was a graduate, a 1968 graduate, of Georgetown, the same year as Bill Clinton. And so they were some of the reasons why Georgetown was very much involved. And we tried to make that involvement as constructive as possible.”
Currie, who will be delivering a mass in dedication of the martyrs, said that he wants to stress a Jesuit university’s ability to enact social and political change worldwide.
“There are people who say that a university should be an ivory tower unsullied by the pressures from society,” Currie said. “Well, the university is always challenged to maintain a certain objectivity. But the Salvadoran martyrs would make the case that [as] responsible intellectuals, Christians cannot sit idly by while these things are happening all around them and not making a contribution as a university and as university people.”
Before Currie discusses the role of Jesuit universities in enacting worldwide change, Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., will lead an academic panel on the past and current situations in El Salvador. O’Brien said that a large part of the discussion will focus on poverty, gangs and violence in the country.
“It’s so sad to see how gangs are ravaging the country,” O’Brien said. “The flow of drugs is also contributing to significant crime and human rights violations, and the effect of free trade and mining on the country. … When we talk about fighting for justice today in El Salvador, what does that look like? That’s what the academic panel will be focused on.”
Assistant Director of Ignatian Programs and Retreats Colleen Kerrisk (COL ’10) said that the discussion will also focus on the economic disparities in the country.
“It will also address the huge disparities between people who have and people who don’t. In 2009 I went on an immersion trip and they took us to a huge mall, and literally across the street is a tent city,” Kerrisk said. “There are thousands of people living in tents, and it’s crazy that you can hear American pop music and get McDonald’s and American Apparel and Abercrombie and Fitch, and these people don’t have plumbing.”
In addition to this week of events, the university has also honored the martyrs by planting eight rose bushes outside of Dahlgren Chapel in their memory, according to Kerrisk.
O’Brien said he believes the events will encourage students to fight for social justice through academia and faith.
“We need to share the story of these men and women and what they stood for to make sure that what they lived and died for lives on,” O’Brien said. “We’re going to tell the story, and hopefully their story will inspire students from any or no faith tradition to take their faith and education and put it into practice to help those on the margins of our society. That’s what these people did, and continue to do.”

Fr. James Martin, S.J., a New York Times bestselling author and editor of America magazine, spoke Wednesday evening in the Intercultural Center auditorium about encountering and forming a relationship with Jesus, which is the topic of his latest book, “Jesus: A Pilgrimage.”
During the event, attended by around 300 people, Martin drew on his life experiences to illustrate the importance of forming a personal relationship with Jesus and seeing Christ’s life through a variety of perspectives. He interspersed his commentary with jokes, utilizing the same sense of humor he has become famous for as the chaplain to “The Colbert Report.”
Martin focused a large part of his talk on the importance of approaching Jesus both through the lens of history and the lens of faith. Both mindsets offer different revelations about Jesus and his teachings, according to Martin.
“To fully meet Jesus Christ, the believer needs both to understand the Jesus of history, the man who walked the earth, and to encounter the Christ of faith, the one who rose from the dead,” Martin said.
Martin also talked about how important it is to acknowledge that Jesus was just as much a human being as he was a divine being. Seeing both sides of Jesus’ personhood is often a struggle, Martin said.
“If Jesus’ humanity is a stumbling block for a lot of people, his divinity is even more so. For a rational, modern mind, talk of the supernatural can be very disturbing, an embarrassment even,” Martin said.
Before opening up the floor to questions, Martin closed his talk by acknowledging the difficulty there is in coming to a complete understanding of Jesus’ identity. He said that in spite of this challenge, the journey to know Jesus is one worth embarking on.
“While Jesus’ identity as the fully human, fully divine son of God remains a mystery, it is a beautiful mystery, the most beautiful one I know and one that is well worth pondering,” Martin said.
During the question-and-answer portion of the event, Martin responded to more than half a dozen audience questions ranging from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to his presence on social media to how best to personally encounter Jesus.
Developing a one-on-one relationship with Jesus was a major theme throughout Martin’s responses to questions. He said that the closer we grow to Christ, the more we come to understand about his teachings and the more we learn about ourselves. Martin recognized, however, that often the call to grow closer to God can be met with resistance from society.
“I think when people hear the words ‘personal relationship with Jesus’ they freak out,” Martin said. “They think you’re hearing voices. So what do you do? … Just tell them your experience.”
After the talk, attendees participated in a book signing with Martin, whose book was available for purchase outside the auditorium.
Washington, D.C., resident Becky Moylan has been a long-time fan of Martin and attended the talk to hear him speak in person.
“It was really impactful to take some time away and to really think about what Jesus’ message is and how that influences each of us today,” Moylan said.
Kevin Sullivan (SFS ’14) said he attended the talk to hear Martin talk about his book and share his personal encounters with faith.
“I really learned just from the way he [Martin] speaks to others,” Sullivan said. “I really enjoyed hearing his tone in the way he delivers a message that is familiar to some, foreign to others. But the way he did it is just really personable, really relatable, especially to people our generation, our age.”

Monsanto Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer Robert Fraley spoke about global food security and developments in agricultural technology Wednesday in Reiss Science Building in an event hosted by the Georgetown Lecture Fund.
Fraley said that he became interested in research in San Francisco during a peak in scientific development.
“I grew up in a small farm and was the first member of my family to go to college. I had the opportunity to attend the University of Illinois, where I was very interested in research. I then went to the University of California, San Francisco, when the whole biotech industry was getting started,” Fraley said. “The first gene clone experiments were being done at UCSF, and some of these experiments were already being applied to human health care.”
Fraley also spoke about the implications of growth population on food security, with a projected 9.5 billion people living on the planet by 2050.
“That means that by 2050, we will have to produce more food than we have in the entire history of the planet,” Fraley said. “This is important in both the food industry perspective and in the environmental perspective. If we farm the way we do today in 2050, we will have to basically plough up another large amount of land and risk the environment. The solution that I think is ideal is to find ways to farm smarter, better and in environmentally friendly ways.”
Fraley also said that the use of modern tools has and will have a significant impact on agriculture in the future.
“Modern tools have allowed us to change plant breeding,” Fraley said. “The world of plant breeding changed when scientists were able to sequence every single gene in a corn plant or in a potato plant, and now have the ways of being more precise, breed faster and breed more efficiently. This game-changing technology is going to increase fields and productivity and produce better seeds and higher levels of yields and production.”
According to Fraley, the use of genetically modified organisms, often referred to as GMOs, has spread quickly since 1990.
“GMOs have been important, we launched our first product in the 1990s and you can see the adoption of the technology as GMOs are now being grown in 30 countries around the world,” Fraley said. “The tools are both utilized by both large farmers and small farmers, basically because they provided growth and tools for increasing production and other benefits.”
Community Garden President Michelle Stearn (SFS ’15) said she does not approve of Monsanto’s corporate control of GMOs and crops.
“Let’s say we set precautionary concerns about human and environmental health aside — then, in theory, I would be alright with GMOs, assuming they would be to increase yield or decrease pesticide use,” Stearn said. “But on principle, I’m not alright with the monopolistic corporate takeover of the entire value chain of crop production by Monsanto and other biotech crops, who now control everything from seeds to pesticides to cultivation. To me, injustice against farmers on an international scale can’t be rationalized by supposed increased yields or so-called biotechnology.”
Cecilia Carvalho (MSB ’18), who attended the event, said she disapproves of the company’s practices.
“He talked about the genome as if it was a database, that farmers all over the world could access, and he did not mention that there is a membership fee, to access this database,” Carvalho said. “Farmers are pressured into joining and paying a lot of money for their seeds, because their competitors are able to sell at lower prices. This kind of pressure is what moves their company financially and is also what has led a lot of farmers in the United States to go bankrupt.”

No results have yet been issued in the Advisory Neighborhood Council 2E elections as the District Board of Elections continues to count absentee and special ballot votes. Kendyl Clausen (SFS ’16) and Reed Howard (SFS ’17) campaigned for the two student commissioner positions as write-in candidates.
Clausen is running to represent District 4 of ANC 2E including New South, Southwest Quad, Village A, Village C West and the Jesuit Residence, and Howard is running to represent District 8, which includes Nevils, Alumni Square, Copley Hall, Harbin Hall, Village C East, Darnall Hall and Henle Village.
Neither gained enough signatures over the summer to officially file for candidacy before the November election, requiring supporters to write in the candidates’ names on the ballot. No candidates appeared on the ballot for the two districts.
As of Thursday, the District Board of Elections reported on its official website that in District 4, two write-in votes had been cast, while District 8 had seen nine write-in votes. Clausen clarified that this did not encompass the totality of the votes cast in the region.
“Not all the votes of our district have been counted. Anybody who registered same day (which for my district, would be the majority of people) was given a special ballot. If you look at the DCBOE results, you’ll see that none of the special ballots have been counted yet,” Clausen wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Even after all the ballots are counted, the candidates will not officially be declared the winners immediately. DCBOE Media Relations Officer Denise Toliver explained that, because there were no candidates filed in the two districts, anyone who received a write-in vote would have seven days to fill out a form to file official candidacy. Of the people who file for candidacy, the candidate with the most write-in votes at this stage will then be declared the winner.
“There is no candidate filed with the board. Say I wrote my name in, you wrote your name in, and Carol Schwartz wrote her name in. If I were the only one who filed for candidacy, I would automatically be the winner,” Toliver said.
Craig Cassey (COL ’15), the outgoing District 4 commissioner, noted that in 2012, when he was elected, the Board of Elections did not announce the results until Nov. 23, two-and-a-half weeks after the Nov. 6 election.
“Given that it’s not a presidential election, it’s a smaller election; one to two weeks doesn’t seem unreasonable,” Cassey said.

While the university is set to break ground on the $60 million John R. Thompson Jr. Intercollegiate Athletic Center, which will serve as the new home of Georgetown varsity athletics, the condition of Kehoe Field continues to worsen, drawing ire from members of the club and intramural sports teams that practice there.
The university has enlisted the help of engineering firms Simpson Gumpertz & Heger and Robert Silman Associates to conduct a study of a renovation of Kehoe, which was deemed unfit for varsity practice in 2007. The university anticipates that the study will conclude in January and preliminary estimates place the cost for the necessary renovations at $10 million.
Problems with Kehoe Field include large sections of torn up artificial turf, exposed concrete and uneven surfaces.
“That study will determine what’s the best approach to addressing the structural issue of the field in the most economical way, the total deferred maintenance requirements of Yates as a whole and what program will go on top of the field once it is replaced,” Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey said.
The roof of Yates, which also serves as the base of the field, is a lightweight concrete that contributes to many of Kehoe’s structural problems. Over time, the concrete has deteriorated and clogged drainage lines. This has led to divots, ripped field surfaces and bumpy turf.
Morey said that the university is looking to correct these problems and improve the playing surface.
“We need to look at it programmatically and we need to find the financial wherewithal to make it happen,” he said. “We recognize it’s an issue and we’re working as hard as we can to get it fixed. It’s a lot of space that could be better utilized.”
This is not the first study to look into Kehoe, but it may be the first seen to completion. The university previously commissioned a similar study into the feasibility of repairing Kehoe, but abandoned it due to budget constraints.
Club soccer captain Ricky Altema (NHS ’15) said the damaged practice facility interferes with practice.
“I think the current condition of Kehoe is dreadful and seriously hazardous to anyone playing up there, whether competitively or casually,” Altema said.
Problems with Kehoe Field have forced some club teams, including Ultimate Frisbee and men’s soccer, to alter their practices in order to take extra precaution.
Ultimate Frisbee captain Matt Javitt (SFS ’15) said the team refrains from diving on the turf.
“We’re wary of the increased likelihood of injury on Kehoe,” Javitt said.
Altema, who sustained an ankle injury on the field last year, said club soccer will not practice at all when the field is wet to avoid injury.
“We are definitely more cautious when playing on Kehoe,” Altema said. “Players are more cognizant of cement bumps and pits in certain areas of the field, which detracts from the intensity of practices.”
Javitt said that Kehoe continues to worsen each year, and nothing has been done to repair it.
“Every year I’ve been here, more and more cracks appear in the turf and bare concrete is exposed,” Javitt said. “There are areas where there are noticeable divots, where the turf is not even supported by concrete.”
Georgetown University Student Association President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said GUSA has been a proponent of Kehoe renovation since a 2013 survey by the university revealed that many students suffered injuries on the field.
“Through various avenues, GUSA advocated to have that feasibility study re-prioritized, and that it should be done by the end of the academic year,” he said.
Altema said that the administration’s response to problems on the field has been frustrating for members of club sports teams.
“The club sports department has been totally fair and compliant when it comes to maximizing time allotted to teams to play on MultiSport [Facility],” Altema said. “Nonetheless, it seems irresponsible on the university’s part to have allowed these safety issues to persist for so long, only to address complaints by laying down a single lowly patch of new turf.”

The Office of Communications, which runs Georgetown’s official accounts on sites such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Flickr, has begun to expand the university’s social media platform and marketing techniques this semester in order to include more student-generated content.
“A bigger initiative that we’ve had [is] to refocus on student-generated content,” said Laura Wilson (GRD ’11), the newly hired director of digital engagement and social media.“We still have a mix of professionally produced original content that we’re creating but you’ll see more and more as you look through our social channels what we’ve been sharing is curated content directly from students.”
The effort derives in part from a desire to make Georgetown’s online presence appear more authentic, Wilson said.
“Hopefully [Georgetown is] a relatable brand online and we’re translating that appropriately from the real word to the digital space,” Wilson said. “That’s why we’re using more student-generated content, so we’re giving that authentic voice. We’re giving the students an opportunity to show this is what Georgetown means for them.”
As part of a series called Georgetown Stories, the university’s website features 11 current students, who frequently post photos and videos of their experiences throughout the year. The Office of Communications provides direction to ensure the students provide an all-encompassing view of Georgetown.
“Some weeks we have an assignment; one was spirituality, [one] of the things that Georgetown is known for,” Georgetown Stories participant Eric Scheetz (SFS ’17) said. “They’ll say, we’d like one of your videos to be about this or that. … Generally, what I do during the week is just film stuff, take pictures as it’s happening and then when [I] get to the end of the week, I collect everything, edit my videos and submit it all.”
Latazia Carter (COL ’17), another participant, said she thinks the university’s online presence successfully communicates with prospective students.
“Georgetown still does some media that is straight from the school,” Carter said. “Mixing it with some of the media that comes from the students helps the actual view of Georgetown because you still have the professional side but you also have student-led content of the Georgetown experience.”
In addition to Georgetown Stories, the Office of Communications has also revitalized social media content on other popular sites, such as Instagram and Twitter. The office often reposts student photos of campus, and recently held a Georgetown photo contest. The winner received a $100 gift card to The Tombs.
“The best way to really engage with the university on social [media] is really to make sure that you’re reaching out, so you’re tagging us, you’re sharing something that you want us to see. …We’re constantly searching the university streams,” Wilson said. “It’s really how I get a lot of my ideas and get a good feel for the pulse of what is going on and what people are talking about on campus.”
Although the Office of Communications has recently reached out to students in its marketing techniques, other groups, such as the Georgetown Admissions Ambassador Program, have been increasing efforts to connect with an increasingly large audience of prospective students.
“We really ramped up our social media efforts two years ago,” GAAP Vice President Matthew Strauss (SFS ’15) said. “[The Class of 2018] was the first where we really had a concentrated social media plan.”
The GAAP board increased the program’s presence on the admitted students’ Facebook group and also launched “Finding a Home on the Hilltop,” a blog featuring advice and experiences from members of the GAAP team. Although GAAP and the Office of Communications do not work together directly, Strauss said that GAAP often points to the university’s new initiatives as a resource for prospective students.
“There’s not a ton of communication between us and the Office [of Communications],” Strauss said. “There is a lot of opportunity to borrow and highlight other things. … A lot of times, people will say, ‘We want to hear more about Georgetown, the blog’s great, the Facebook group is great, but how do we learn more?’ So we’ll point people to things that the university does.”
Associate Director for Student Engagement Amanda Carlton said that student outreach through social media is an integral component of marketing to both current and prospective students.
“It’s another means in which clubs can market and outreach to our campus community and even to people beyond the Georgetown campus community,” Carlton said. “I think we talk a lot about globalization and the importance of building global citizens at Georgetown, and I think you can’t do that by just staying here on the Hilltop.”
According to Wilson, the Office of Communications hopes to work with student groups in the future to bolster the university’s social media presence.
“It’s something we absolutely have on the docket to tackle, if not fall 2014, certainly in the spring semester of this year,” Wilson said. “There is a lot of value and empowering student organizations to leverage what’s available out there.”
