The School of Foreign Service’s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy presented Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield with its annual Trainor Award.
Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations (U.N.), received the J. Raymond “Jit” Trainor Award, which recognizes excellence in the field of diplomacy each year. Thomas-Greenfield retired from the U.S. Foreign Service in 2017, joining the Georgetown University community as the Distinguished Resident Fellow in African Studies at the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, a research organization affiliated with the School of Foreign Service that aims to foster discussion and enable developments in the field of international diplomatic relations.
Thomas-Greenfield previously served in various capacities within the federal government, including as the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, the Director General of the Foreign Service and Director of Human Resources, the American ambassador to Liberia and a foreign service officer posted in six countries on four different continents.
Thomas-Greenfield, who joins the ranks of presidents, ambassadors and military officers as a Trainor Award recipient, dedicated her acceptance speech to the pursuit of universal human rights and referenced an important anniversary for the issue.
“Seventy-five years ago, Eleanor Roosevelt stood in a room with diplomats from more than fifty other countries. They were preparing to vote on an unprecedented document, a document so sweeping, so powerful and so dramatic that it would impact every single person on earth. At three o’clock in the morning, after two years of intense negotiations, they adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,” Thomas-Greenfield said at the event.
Since her 2021 confirmation as only the second Black woman to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Thomas-Greenfield has stood up for marginalized groups worldwide, including the Uyghur Muslims in western China and the Tigray people in northern Ethiopia. 
Thomas-Greenfield said the permanent presence of human rights violators like the Russian and Chinese governments should be a subject of concern for the powerful U.N. Security Council.
“Some of the planet’s most powerful countries are arguing that human rights are not universal, that instead they ought to be applied based on the local context,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “It is no coincidence that these same governments are some of the world’s worst abusers of human rights.”
Thomas-Greenfield said specific actions by both countries’ governments fly in the face of human rights guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
“China has committed genocide and crimes against humanity against the Uyghurs, and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “Russian forces have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine.”
Before taking questions from student audience members, Thomas-Greenfield spoke with Anne Anderson, an Irish diplomat who served as Ireland’s ambassador to the United States and U.N.
Anderson asked Thomas-Greenfield about recent Chinese actions to increase China’s influence in the U.N., and Thomas-Greenfield said that diplomatic chaos during the Trump administration enabled China to gain a foothold and develop its relationship with Russia.
“There were a lot of gaps and a lot of space that we didn’t hold on to,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “China looked into action and started moving into empty spaces and they did start to flex their muscles. I wasn’t prepared, I will admit, for how close a relationship China and Russia have, despite the fact that there are differences.”
Both China and Russia hold permanent seats in the U.N. Security Council, despite their violations of human rights against minority groups — China continues to persecute the Uyghur people in the Xinjiang region while Russian soldiers have perpetuated atrocities against Ukrainians.
Thomas-Greenfield said America’s global influence is still prevalent and impactful when it is used to its fullest potential, even as concerning developments continue to emerge from Russia and China.
“We’re still the largest funder of the U.N. We still are the largest humanitarian donor. But we have to exert that power to give our voice the power,” Thomas-Greenfield said.
Thomas-Greenfield said she encourages Georgetown students to consider careers in public service, and to keep human rights in mind throughout their journeys.
“In each generation, the struggle continues,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “Soon it will be your turn, and standing still is not an option. Instead, as potential public servants, allow me to enlist you in this struggle. When we see abuses and violations, we must push, prod and fight for justice.”

54 Georgetown students are finalists this year for a prestigious program intended to prepare them for careers in public service — the most finalists out of any academic institution.
The 54 students are among 850 finalists from over 10,000 applicants to join the U.S. Presidential Management Fellows Program, which gives fellows the opportunity to cultivate their public leadership skills with two years of rotational training in federal agencies. 
The fellows hail from three undergraduate schools and four graduate schools of Georgetown and bring a variety of perspectives and interests to the program, according to the Georgetown University press release. 
Zsofia Deak (GRD ’23), a Presidential Management Fellow (PMF), said that while the program was not on her radar until after she entered Georgetown’s Master of Science in Foreign Service program, her interest in receiving valuable career experience and mentorship inspired her to apply.
“What led me to apply was my interest in a career in public service,” Deak told The Hoya. “I’ve always wanted to work in government, and saw the PMF as a great opportunity to get leadership and mentorship experience — and get exposure to different government agencies and bureaus.”
Deak said that while her ideal posting would be within the U.S. Department of State, she feels that keeping an open mind will enable her to prepare for a diplomatic career wherever she is posted in the PMF program.
“My long-term ambition is to be a diplomat,” Deak said. “I think this two-year leadership experience will give me relevant skills and understanding of how the government, State Department, work in pursuit of that long term goal.”
Michelle Hanssen (GRD ’23), a PMF specializing in Russia and Eurasia, said her interest in the program started after a professor encouraged her to look into it.  
“After attending an information session, I thought the PMF would be an excellent opportunity, at the very least, to expand my idea of what it might mean to work in the federal government–and how my somewhat specific, interdisciplinary, area studies background might be useful or applicable,” Hanssen wrote to The Hoya. 
Deak said she took advantage of assistance from the Career Center throughout the application process, and she encourages prospective applicants to seek out these resources.
“My advice to anyone aspiring to apply for PMF is to just go for it,” Deak said. “It’s not a super involved application. There’s nothing to lose by submitting an application, and work with the Career Center, because they have a lot of important insight and knowledge about the process and what to expect.”
Hannah Barrett (GRD ’23) said that the PMF program will provide her with an invaluable opportunity to advance her career interests in security studies.
“I have always been interested in government jobs, but it can be difficult to get your foot in the door outside of programs like the PMF, so this was the perfect opportunity,” Barrett wrote to The Hoya.
Barrett said she feels the structure of the program will positively impact her initial experience working in the federal government.
“I think the PMF program gives recent graduates the chance to make a tangible impact early on in their careers, and I’m excited to take advantage of the rotation program which allows PMFs to try out multiple roles throughout their appointments,” Barrett said.
“At this early stage I can confidently state that there is much to be gained from going through the application and interview process even if you’re not certain where your next steps will lead–and the PMF is relatively straightforward,” Hanssen wrote.

A democracy researcher discussed the current state of global governance with students and professors in a March 14 event hosted by the Georgetown University department of government.
Staffan Lindberg, a professor at the University of Gothenburg, spoke about ongoing developments in democratic and authoritarian governments around the world at the event. Students and professors asked questions to Lindberg and his colleague, Evie Papada, a research and policy analyst, regarding trade dynamics and the role of gender in democracy.
Lindberg and Papada are affiliated with the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) Institute, an international group that conducts research and provides quantitative ratings of global governments based on their levels of democracy. Lindberg, the director of V-Dem, discussed the institute’s annual democracy report that compiles statistics and contextual information to provide a global outlook on the state of democratic governance.
Lindberg said statistics derived from the macro-level data he studies support the idea that there is a global trend toward autocracy — and away from democracy.
“42 countries autocratized. It’s never been higher in our time series, starting from 1900,” Lindberg said at the event. “43% of the world’s population live in those 42 countries, up from the 5% just 10 years ago.”
Lindberg said this move away from electoral freedom has surprising tangible ramifications, including rising global temperatures.
“The difference between democracies and autocracies is equivalent to a difference of -1.6 degrees in the increase of global warming,” Lindberg said. “Global warming would be 1.6 degrees less if the world was fully democratic.”
Autocratic governments fare much worse than their democratic counterparts in terms of regulating the climate and reducing warming temperatures, according to a study published by the V-Dem Institute. 
While these recent developments are concerning, Lindberg said global bright spots that have been successful in building fair and democratic governments through citizen protest and activism teach the global community lessons about governance.
“In South Korea, there were 2.3 million people on the streets at the same time,” Lindberg said. “Sudan — it’s not exactly heaven there now — unseated a long-standing dictatorship in Africa with popular mobilization.”
Despite theories suggesting that trading with autocratic governments pushes them toward democracy, evidence collected by V-Dem and other researchers refutes this proposition.
“Trading with autocracies would liberalize them and lead to pressures for democratization — it just doesn’t seem that the empirical patterns support that much,” Lindberg said. “It hasn’t helped much with Russia, either.”
Lindberg also said the democratizing actions of powerhouse countries positively impact smaller nations struggling against autocracy.
“The countries that are defying autocratization are small,” Lindberg said. “When you have big global trends where big powerful countries are involved, they tend to drag some along.”
Lindberg said that in looking at data, factors that seem promising are often not accurate indicators of the state of democracy. 
Lindberg cited the specific example of Belarus, a Russian satellite state with an authoritarian government and a leader many view as a dictator. Certain facets of the country’s political system, including legal codes and legislative power, would seemingly hint at increased democracy, but Lindberg said these are deceptive.
Lindberg said the V-Dem Institute in the future may reconsider the way it studies gender and global governance in light of recent pro-democratic movements led by women. 
“There is a lot of correlation and theoretical intuition that democracy is about political equality, and in modern times, at least, that means equality between men and women,” Lindberg said. “The need in democracies is for women to have more important positions, then you get more of a real equality, not just to showcase women in legislatures that have no influence.”

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate approved an act in its March 13 meeting submitting a referendum for students to vote on raising the student activity fee, an extra charge each student must pay in addition to their current cost of attendance, in the coming GUSA election. 
The current student activity fee is $179 for the academic year but will already be increasing to $185 due to the tuition rise increase taking effect next year, Provost Robert Groves and Executive Vice President for Health Sciences Edward Healton announced in a Feb. 21 email to students. In the April referendum, students will vote on whether to further raise each student’s contribution to the student activity fund by $45, from $185 to $230. 
GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee Chair John DiPierri (SFS ’25) and GUSA Senate Speaker Manahal Fazal (SFS ’24) introduced the resolution, which GUSA Policy and Advocacy Committee Chair Joshua Bernard-Pearl (SFS ’25) co-sponsored. The referendum will pass if a majority of voters are in support of the fee increase and the voter total is over 25%.
DiPierri said the increased student fee contribution will allow GUSA to better match clubs’ funding requests, as it will give GUSA an extra $296,000 to distribute to clubs for a total of $1.58 million.
“Requests for clubs and advisory boards always exceed the amount of money that we can give,” DiPierri said at the meeting. “The problem is that it’s getting to a point where the requests are so high that the current amount per student, we can’t realistically provide what these clubs need.”
DiPierri said he advocated for a referendum instead of a petition to the administration because the administration would be unlikely to respond to the latter.
“Georgetown is very much behind the ball as compared to other universities and their contributions to their student activities fees and their contributions to student life,” DiPierri said. “It behooves us to put in a referendum and say, ‘This is what we want for our students. This is how we’re going to make Georgetown a better place.’”
GUSA Senator Dylan Davis (CAS ’26) said GUSA should make its best effort to get funding from administration before asking for students to pay more.
“We’re demanding a $45 increase per student, which presents possibly an undue burden,” Davis said at the meeting. “I feel like we should try to leverage as much as possible and make that increase as narrowly tailored as possible.”
DiPierri said GUSA had exhausted all other options for funding the student activity fee before proposing the referendum.
“The only reason this referendum is coming to us is because this is the only option we have left,” DiPierri said at the meeting. “We’ve been in these conversations for three years now, and there’s been no movement on the administration’s part to support student life in the way that we see fit.”
Senator Andrew Wong (SFS ’26) opposed the act, saying students already have to deal with other financial challenges like next year’s increased tuition.
“People are struggling with everything from groceries to gas, now tuition’s getting hiked,” Wong said at the meeting. “I don’t think slapping a $45 fee increase on students is the way to go here.” 
As the debate became more heated, the senate limited speaking time to one minute per senator. Nevertheless, the meeting went past its allotted time and the senate had to move out of its meeting room and relocate to the Intercultural Center’s first floor elevator lobby to continue their debate.
Senator Max Massick (CAS ’24) said the referendum will hold little weight because it is unlikely that enough students will turn out and vote. 
“We are never going to get 25% of the population to actually vote, whether they vote in favor or against, so it has no effect,” Massick said at the meeting. “It might get people to think about it, and so we might as well show that GUSA can do something and have a referendum because hey, I might be wrong.”
After one and a half hours of debate, the final vote saw the senate approve the act of the referendum, with 18 in favor and two — Davis and Senator George Currie (CAS ’26) — opposing. The senate also scheduled an extra meeting for March 19 to discuss tabled agenda items that the group was unable to get to because of the referendum debate.
DiPerri said the decision on the student activity fee is in the hands of the students. 
“The only agency we have is over ourselves and our tuition dollars,” DiPierri said. “If the student body determines that our tuition dollars are best spent with a $45 increase in student activities, well then, so be it.”

Georgetown University students on the Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC) that represents the university are collaborating with local advocates and other Washington, D.C. elected officials to preserve Glover Archbold Park’s historic Foundry Branch Trestle Bridge.
Joe Massaua (SFS ’25), one of the commissioners of ANC 2E, which includes the university, introduced a resolution at the commission’s Feb. 27 meeting urging the District Department of Transportation (DDOT) to purchase the trestle from the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) for $1 and to fund the bridge’s stabilization and restoration in its budget.
Built in 1896, the trestle used to carry streetcars over the park, connecting the Car Barn to an amusement park in Glen Echo, Md. The last trolleys ran on the trestle in January 1960.
The bridge was open for pedestrian use until 2003, and it has been in disrepair ever since. Because of the risk of collapse, the District in 2016 closed a part of the Glover-Archbold Trail that runs beneath the bridge. 
Massaua said community advocates are pushing for the trestle’s restoration as part of a new trail, the Palisades Trolley Trail, which would run along the old trolley route from Georgetown into the Palisades.
“The whole right-of-way is still there,” Massaua told The Hoya. “It’s a very active right-of-way. People walk their dogs there, right by the reservoir, beautiful views of the Potomac and the canal.”
The bridge’s restoration is vital because it would create a link between the Foxhall neighborhood and Georgetown, according to Massaua.
“This is such a beneficial opportunity for there to be pedestrian connectability slash multi-use options to get to Foxhall,” Massaua said to The Hoya. “Saving the trestle is just a good first step to improve pedestrian connection with Foxhall and it’s a side of campus that’s been neglected for a little while.”
The proposed trolley trail would connect residents of Foxhall, Georgetown and the Palisades to 14 schools, five parks, two libraries, two hospitals and two pools, according to community advocate Brett Young, who has been involved in advocacy for repairing the trolley trestle for almost 10 years.
“Although it’s an expensive project, it’s going to be important and beneficial for all of us,” Young told The Hoya. “Sometimes you got to spend money to create quality connections. For the students and the faculty, making the university part of the city instead of an isolated island — part of the city that we’re going to have and make it bikeable and walkable.”
Massaua said it is important for the trestle to be placed in appropriate ownership, especially as WMATA is seeking to demolish the bridge.
“The resolution basically was advising WMATA — who doesn’t want it, they’ve said that they don’t want it and they’re actively trying to raze it — to sell it to the city for $1 via DDOT,” Massaua said. “They would probably be the best stakeholder to own this. It doesn’t make any sense why it’s still in WMATA’s hands.”
D.C. Councilmember Matt Frumin represents Ward 3, which includes Foxhall and Palisades, said that he has called on D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser to include $3 million in her proposed 2024 budget to stabilize the bridge and to design the future Palisades Trolley Trail. 
“The future Palisades Trolley Trail has the potential to be a regional asset for both sustainable, non-vehicular transportation and for recreation,” Frumin wrote to The Hoya. “Once restored, the Trestle Bridge will be a centerpiece amid scenic ravines and sweeping views of the Potomac.”
“A multi-use trail along the former Glen Echo trolley path will be a useful amenity for all Washingtonians,” Frumin wrote. “I am actively working to ensure the Palisades Trolley Trail effort comes to fruition.”
Massaua credited partnerships between Frumin; ANC 2E, which represents Georgetown; ANC 3D, which represents Foxhall; community members; and students with the progress that advocates have made.
“Historically, in the past, there wasn’t really any momentum or any interest in saving this trestle,” Massaua said. “It’s exciting that our ANC is in a position where we would support this kind of project, and similarly for Foxhall and Palisades, and that there’s students who are on the ANC to support this project.”
