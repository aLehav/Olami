In the latest of a number of burglaries in the Southwest Quad, several students reported the theft of multiple electronic items after returning to their rooms in Reynolds Hall on Friday around 7:12 p.m.
According to the Public Safety Alert sent out by the Department of Public Safety, some of the students burglarized had left their doors unsecured, while others stated they had locked their doors. There were no signs of forced entry.
Students have reported a number of burglaries this summer in the Southwest Quad. The incident mirrors that of the electronic and cash burglaries of several students’ room in Reynolds on June 24.
DPS has turned over the investigation to the District of Columbia’s Metropolitan Police Department.
At press time, representatives for DPS could not be reached for comment.
