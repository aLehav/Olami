Aside from beating their competitor, Wisemiller’s sandwich Chicken Madness, by 287 votes, Georgetown University Student Association President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and Vice President Chris Fisk’s (COL ’17) election was marked by their platform of bridging the divide between GUSA and students and making progress on the campus plan, dining, mental health, sexual assault and low-income advocacy.
Since then, Khan and Fisk, who gave themselves an A-minus for their performance thus far, have worked with the university to secure the campus plan, renew Georgetown’s 10-year dining contract with Aramark and implement a series of reforms to mental health, sexual assault and low-income policies.
Midway through their term, the two shared their reflections on the past half year and their upcoming plans in an interview with The Hoya on Tuesday.
A Plan for the Next 20 Years
The university filed a finalized version of the 2017-2036 Campus Plan on Sept. 1, concluding months of deliberation between GUSA, the university and representatives from the Georgetown neighborhood.
The final plan prioritizes upperclassman housing renovations, allows the renovation and construction of academic spaces and permits the reconstruction of both Kehoe Field and Yates Field House.
The campus plan was the first to include the Georgetown Community Partnership, which consists of university administrators, neighborhood representatives and students, following a lengthy legal battle between the university and neighbors over the 2010 Campus Plan.
The negotiation represented a significant victory for students and GUSA, according to Khan, who is also on GCP.
“When you look at what happened in 2010, in which students essentially got screwed, that is essentially what has led to a lot of the big issues that we’ve experienced since 2010, in terms of deferred maintenance and lack of quality housing on campus, third-year housing requirement,” Khan said.
However, Khan said GUSA plans to address issues neglected by the campus plan, including noise violations and transportation policy. The university has agreed to launch a pilot weekend Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle service next semester with service from noon to 7 p.m. on Saturdays, according to Khan.
“It’s really working with the university to get certain things done, because quite frankly when you work with the neighbors, things aren’t going to move forward unless you agree. It’s a consensus-driven process,” Khan said.
Reforming Georgetown Dining
The university announced Tuesday that Aramark will continue to serve as the university’s dining contractor for the next 10 years following a long bid process.
The contract includes a renovation of O’Donovan Hall to include a food court for meal exchanges on the top floor and a healthier buffet option on the bottom floor, in addition to expanded meal exchange options across campus and new meal plans.
Khan said GUSA played a significant role in the new dining contract.
“Both Aramark and Sodexo said they have never seen a student body so involved in the dining process. We essentially shaped what came out of the new Aramark contract,” Khan said.
Continuing Conversations on Mental Health
Policy surrounding mental health has largely fallen into the hands of the Mental Health Advisory Board, a board consisting of students and administrators who address mental health issues on campus.
The board, on which GUSA Mental Health Policy Team Chair Sylvia Levy (SFS ’18) sits, has worked to increase accessibility to mental health services this semester.
Fisk said GUSA will build on this work by asking university administrators to address issues stemming from higher demand for mental health resources, including longer wait times for CAPS appointments.
“Before you had a price problem and a stigma problem, and now these things are being changed little by little because of the conversation on mental health on this campus, but it’s led to secondary byproducts of that,” Fisk said.
Project Lighthouse, an initiative that connects students with peer trained in talking to students and guiding them to appropriate mental health resources,  Executive Director Ben Johnson (NHS ’17) said GUSA’s role on the mental health advisory board needs to be focused on listening to and advocating for students.
“GUSA needs to be the ear itself to collect the noise,” Johnson said.
Becoming a Survivor-Centric Campus
Khan and Fisk began their roles with sexual assault at the forefront of campus conversation, after former GUSA President Joe Luther (COL ’16) and Vice President Connor Rohan’s (COL ’16) administration signed a memorandum of understanding with the university to hire a full-time Title IX coordinator, conduct a sexual misconduct climate survey and introduce mandatory bystander training.
University President John J. DeGioia established the Sexual Assault and Misconduct Task Force this summer after the university released the Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey results in June. Khan sits on the steering committee of the task force. There is also a GUSA representative on each subcommittee.
GUSA worked with the university to introduce a series of policies to support survivors of sexual assault last semester, including a semester of free counseling services at CAPS for survivors.
Khan said GUSA plays a vital role in crafting policy through the subcommittees.
“The students on the task force, particularly on the steering committee, we meet every two weeks and essentially say these are the policies that we want through the different subcommittees and we’re going to get them through,” Khan said.
Low Income Advocacy
Another centerpiece of Khan and Fisk’s campaign was developing policy and holding conversations on low-income advocacy.
This fall, GUSA established the Advisory Board for Affordability and Access, consisting of students, administrators and students to evaluate current resources and suggest policies to support low-income students.
Discussions surrounding low-income issues were lacking before the group was established, according to Fisk.
“It’s not necessarily that the whole university wasn’t discussing it before. It’s that we were discussing it in an inefficient way,” Fisk said.
GUSA also secured university funding to provide housing for students who do not have a stable home to return to over winter breaks. GUSA is now looking to introduce policies to address costs incurred upon all Georgetown students, including printing and laundry costs, textbook prices and graduation costs.
Engaging the Student Body
This fall’s GUSA senate election, which had a 24 percent turnout rate, saw perennial satirical candidate Wisemiller’s Chicken Madness sandwich win its first GUSA election.
Khan said GUSA has sought to engage students in GUSA, as it now totals around 400 members through various structural reforms.
Khan and Fisk restructured the executive branch to develop policy teams with co-chairs from the executive and senate branches to which all students could apply.
The senate is also considering a proposal to abolish the senate and establish a new assembly focused on club funding, which would consist of representatives from club advisory boards and elected student representatives. If approved by the senate, a studentwide referendum on the proposal would occur Dec. 1.
“Historically there has been a disconnect between the student body and GUSA, and we tried to address this by just having more people in GUSA and letting the student body sort of be GUSA and recognize that we are not necessarily a checks-and-balances student government. … We are simply a student union,” Khan said.

The Newseum unveiled a 24-foot-long banner dedicated to kidnapped journalist Austin Tice (SFS ’02) Wednesday with a pledge to keep the banner hanging outside the museum’s Pennsylvania Avenue entrance until Tice is released.
More than 100 people, including Georgetown students and faculty, gathered for the unveiling ceremony, which was hosted in conjunction with Reporters Without Borders to coincide with the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists. Tice, whose whereabouts remain unknown since his 2012 kidnapping in Syria, is currently the only American journalist being held captive in the world.
Tice graduated from the School of Foreign Service and served as a captain in the Marine Corps before leaving between his second and third year at the Georgetown University Law Center to pursue a career as a freelance journalist.
Beginning in 2012, Tice contributed stories about the impact of Syria’s civil war on civilians to The Washington Post, the Associated Press, National Public Radio and the BBC. He disappeared Aug. 14, 2012, as he was preparing to travel from Daraya, Syria, to Beirut, Lebanon.
The last correspondence his family received was a video of a blindfolded Tice held by armed men a month after his disappearance. In partnership with the American division of Reporters Without Borders, his parents, Marc and Debra Tice, have  continued to request aid to pursue his safe return home.
At the unveiling, Newseum President and CEO Jeffrey Herbst said the the banner’s location about a mile from the White House will remind the public of the dangers faced by the press around the world.
“It will be here, if he is not released beforehand, on Jan. 20 when the next president walks by,” Herbst said. “We hope we will take it down soon when he is released, but we are committed to working toward his freedom for the duration.”
Herbst introduced The Washington Post Foreign Editor Douglas Jehl, who drew parallels between Tice’s kidnapping and detainment of Iranian-American journalist and The Washington Post Tehran Bureau Chief Jason Rezaian, who was released in January after being convicted and jailed for espionage in Iran in 2015.
“The previous ordeal involving The Post’s Tehran Bureau Chief Jason Rezaian has also taught us that public attention is absolutely indispensible in persuading everyone concerned to help innocent journalists like Jason and Austin regain their freedom,” Jehl said.
Reporters Without Borders U.S. Director Delphine Halgand said her organization is focused on emphasizing the urgency of Tice’s case to the U.S. government. She cited sources in Syria who verify that Tice is still alive and is not being held by the Islamic State group.
“There has been no request for ransom, there has been no direct communication. What we know is that many high-level sources in different governments assure us that he’s alive, that he’s held captive somewhere in Syria,” Halgand said. “We know he is not held by ISIS, he is not held by Islamist groups, so it’s not a ransom issue.”
Tice’s mother Debra Tice thanked the Newseum, Reporters Without Borders and those attending the event for their commitment to her son’s freedom and pled for continued help in bringing him home.
“Austin has been held captive in Syria for 1,542 days,” Debra Tice said. “His captivity is indicative of the very real dangers journalists face as they exercise the fundamental human right to information, opinion and expression. We call on Austin’s captors to reach out and make it clear how we can resolve this situation and get our son safely home.”
Debra Tice said the banner marks a reminder to both the president and American citizens of the danger journalists face as well as the obligation to keep them safe.
“Austin’s continued captivity is indicative of the growing global indifference and even acceptance of efforts to silence journalists,” Debra Tice said. “With the hanging of this banner, here on America’s main street, we remind our president of his obligation to secure Austin’s safe release and we hope all Americans and every person who sees this banner will realize we have a duty to demand that universally agreed upon protections for journalists must be respected.”
Rep. John Delaney of Maryland (GRD ’88) attended the event and expressed his intention to use his congressional influence to assist in the return of a fellow Georgetown alumnus.
“We’ve been doing everything we can with me being in Congress to draw attention to this issue put our shoulder against it in any way we can,” Delaney said.
Georgetown Journalism Department Director Barbara Feinman Todd said in an interview with The Hoya that there are plans for continued student activism regarding Austin’s case.
“We would like to get a banner and hang it at Georgetown, a similar one. So that’s next on the list,” Feinman Todd said.  “We’ve got a letter-writing campaign in the works — the students are doing a letter-writing campaign to the White House and we’ll be making the details public very soon.”
Feinman Todd also emphasized the importance of educating students on the issues of safety for those hoping to pursue international journalism.
“It’s very important for me as I’m sending students out into the world to become journalists themselves that it’s a safer world for them,” Feinman Todd said. “At the same time, there’s the tension of wanting to go out there and tell the stories, the kind of stories Austin was telling. He cared about the Syrian people, particularly Syrian children, and there aren’t enough people telling those stories. But it comes with such a great risk, it’s hard to expect people to do that.”
Representatives from Reporter Without Borders distributed #FreeAustin pins to the crowd, and Georgetown students who attended wore blindfolds with the hashtag #FreeAustinTice, previously used during an April demonstration at the White House.
A delegation of Georgetown students led by Ari Goldstein (COL ’18) and Emily Kaye (COL ’18), who are spearheading a student organization supporting the movement, said they used the blindfold to symbolize a world without journalists in which all people are blindfolded from information and truth.
Goldstein said Tice’s story resonated with him because of the journalist’s bravery and compassion in bringing awareness to struggles of Syrian civilian victims of the civil war.
“Austin’s story matter to me as a Hoya, it matters to me as an American, and this hanging of the banner was a pretty significant step forward. Even though it was just a banner, it’s part of a larger public campaign around Austin’s story that is beginning to take hold across the country,” Goldstein said.

Aramark will remain the university’s dining contractor for the next 10 years, with plans to expand meal exchange options and convert the first floor of O’Donovan Hall into a food court this summer.
The contract, announced by Chief Operating Officer Christopher Augostini in a campuswide email Tuesday, concludes a yearlong bid process for the dining contract between Aramark and Sodexo, the two finalists.
Under Aramark’s plan, the top floor of Leo’s will be renovated into a food court with retail providers, including District Donuts, as well as vegan and gluten-free food options integrated into all menus.
The top floor will have the same amount of seating compared to the current layout but will focus on giving students a meal exchange option with increased portability.
The Fresh Food Company will manage the bottom floor of Leo’s, which will retain the traditional all-you-can-eat layout with an emphasis on healthy options. The number of guest swipes will increase from two to five.
Chief Business Officer for University Services Debbie Morey said while concrete plans have not been established, dining options will see significant changes.
“There [are] a lot of moving parts, and these are very aggressive timelines. This is not unusual for food because you often have food companies come in and flip places overnight,” Morey said. “We are basically gutting Leo’s and changing the way it looks.”
Hoya Court will also see renovations as part of the plan, according to Morey.
“The idea behind Hoya Court is it doesn’t matter how many locations — the idea isn’t working right now. It is an awkward setting for people to eat so are we reimagining Hoya Court along with the bookstore renovation that is going on this summer,” Morey said.
Students on campus this summer will not be able to access Leo’s while the renovations take place, and will go to a temporary location for dining instead.
Associate Vice President for Auxiliary Services Joelle Wiese said the new contract would improve the quality of Leo’s dining options.
In the year leading up to the dining proposals, Georgetown University Student Association conducted an extensive awareness campaign to encourage students to be involved in the process.
Both finalists presented proposed future dining offerings and meal plan structures at open houses in September for members of the community. In addition, the university held a food forum Oct. 6, the night before the university chose a vendor, to enable students to provide input.
GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said the new exchange options and improved food quality will address significant complaints for students.
“Flexibility, variety and quality were really the big parts that were most needed,” Khan said. “The current all-you-can-eat model of students only being able to eat at one location as their home base, and then essentially having to now [use meal] exchange, was a big problem, and was something frustrating students.”
Wiese said Aramark’s contract will follow the university’s just employment policy, which states that Georgetown will attempt to avoid job losses when subcontractors are changed.
The decision is the result of yearlong process led by the Office of Auxiliary Business Services’ Request for Proposal Committee, a 30-person working group consisting of six students, including GUSA members.
According to Morey, the new dining plan will not impose new longterm costs on the university. The contract is expected to pay for itself in the form of increased student traffic and students purchasing meal plans.
“Georgetown’s dining program is a self-sustaining program and we do not subsidize food on our campus,” Morey said. “There [are] so many more options that you will start to see the value in it, and we will start to see an increase in those sales. That is how we will pay for the amortization and the investment on this.”
GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff Garrett Williams (COL ’18), who was on the RFP committee, said the committee visited other nearby college campuses, including the University of Delaware and George Mason University, where Sodexo and Aramark operated respective dining plans in place that were similar to their proposals.
The new dining plans follow an expansion of student dining options over the summer, including the addition of meal exchange options at Hoya Court locations and Cosi after 3 p.m. and mobile ordering app Tapingo. The university also added takeaway options at Leo’s and the ability to purchase additional tax-free Flex Dollars throughout the year.
At a reception held in Leo’s for all 250 employees of Georgetown Dining, Morey said the new contract aims to create the best-in-class dining experience for students.
“It was important for us to find a partner that would take us to a new level of service and dining on campus,” Morey said. “Our vision is for Georgetown to provide a model program that other universities can achieve. We are all embarking on this transformative journey together.”
According to Marisa Colon (COL ’19), improvements to campus dining are positive.
“Leo’s does need to change, but I think it’s more about the quality of the food. I would be happy if they committed to fresher produce rather than having vendors,” Colon said. “We’re not even asking that much, we’re just asking for better quality food rather than a whole elaborate, fancy dining hall.”
Matt Treacy (COL ’19) said he is cautious about the planned improvements to the dining hall and meal plans at Georgetown.
“Looking at the posters in Leo’s, I have a really hard time believing that they’re going to have that done by next fall. That’s not going to happen,” Treacy said. “Also, if the second level is all made-to-order food, that’s going to take forever. That just doesn’t make sense. It’s all a little too good to be true, like a little too utopian.”
Some students, like Stephanie Huang (NHS ’18), do not understand the need for the slated changes to Leo’s.
“I’m actually one of the few people who enjoys Leo’s. I wish they had more variety sometimes, but it’s healthy food,” Huang said. “They have nutritious options, so I don’t really see a need for the new project. I guess we’ll have to wait and see though.”

Tens of thousands of Washington, D.C. voters have broken the District’s early voting records to weigh in on the presidential election, local government races and a referendum to petition Congress to include D.C. as the 51st state.
Across the United States, 37 states and D.C. offer a form of early voting that does not require the voter to provide a reason for not waiting until Election Day next Tuesday. The District, along with 22 other states, allow for early voting on weekends.
According to D.C. Board of Elections Public Information Officer Tamara Robinson, the 2016 election season in D.C. has seen a record 14 percent early turnout among eligible voters, exceeding previous years’ averages hovering at 10 or 11 percent. As of Oct. 31, the D.C. Board of Elections listed 478,93 D.C. residents as registered to vote out of the total population recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau of 672,228.
According to the Associated Press, around 33 million votes nationwide, representing roughly one-quarter of total expected votes, have already been cast.
The polls opened at One Judiciary Square in downtown D.C. on Oct. 22 before expanding to sites in all eight wards Oct. 28, providing eligible residents a nearly two-week window before early voting closes Nov.
Off to the Races
The District has three electoral votes, all of which went to President Barack Obama in 2012 along with 90.9 percent of the popular vote.
Among the local elections, the Ward 7 seat on the D.C. Council is expected to go to former mayor Vincent Gray (D) over independents Gary Butler and Christian Carter. Gray’s election to the council seat would mark a comeback for the politico, who lost his reelection bid in 2014 to current Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) amid a federal corruption probe into the funding of Gray’s campaign.
Six candidates are vying for the council’s two at-large seats in play, with incumbent David Grosso (I) and Robert White (D) far outspending their opponents. The race features the only Republican candidate Carolina Celnik, a D.C. lawyer on the District ballot, excluding Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence.
The Ward 2, Ward 4 and Ward 8 elections feature two incumbents and one candidate running unopposed.
The State of the District
One of the most highly discussed items on the ballot is the referendum for D.C. statehood.
This July, the D.C. Council unanimously approved placing the measure on November’s ballot. If passed, the referendum would advise the council to petition Congress to admit D.C. as a state and initiate the process of approving a state constitution. Overall, the referendum boasts overwhelming support in D.C.
The most recent polling of District residents conducted by The Washington Post in November 2015 found that roughly 70 percent of voters were in favor of statehood.
Christopher Murphy, Georgetown’s government relations and community engagement vice president, said the referendum is highly significant.
“The referendum is important because it reminds our nation’s leaders — and indeed all Americans — about the injustice D.C. residents continue to suffer from,” Murphy wrote in an email to The Hoya. “To deny more than 670,000 American citizens the most basic of democratic rights because of where they live is un-American and unconscionable.”
Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service Executive Director Mo Elleithee said even if the statehood referendum passes, he does not expect Congress to support that decision.
“I don’t foresee there being any real movement towards statehood in a tangible way any time soon, especially if Republicans control the congress, because the Republican leadership in the House has been fairly steadfast in opposition,” Elleithee said. “Until there is a major change in Congressional leadership, you’re not going to see any real entertaining of the notion.”
McCourt School of Public Policy government professor Michael Bailey agreed that the idea would likely be opposed by Congress, blaming a largely Republican desire to keep representatives of the District — who are historically Democrats — out of congressional voting positions.
“The consequence would be we’d get a voting member in the House of Representatives, and I presume we’d get the two senators. We’d have normal statehood,” Bailey said. “They’d obviously be Democrats, and maybe some people don’t want more democrats in Congress.”
D.C. resident Jim Schank, who voted Wednesday at the One Judiciary Square polling location, said he was compelled to vote in favor of D.C. statehood because of the District’s current lack of representation.
“We need representation in both houses of Congress. D.C. has a larger population than some of those right-wing, Midwestern states like Wyoming, and it’s about fairness,” Schank said.
Though the statehood movement has considerable popularity, president of GU Students for D.C. Statehood Annie Mason (COL ’18) cited misinformation and assumptions about statehood as a challenge to the movement.
“People think it’s a more ceremonial transition from city to state and it doesn’t have any actually legal implications, when it fact it really does,” Mason said. “A challenge is people who think that it’s just D.C. making hullabaloo about nothing, when it really is rooted in civil rights and representation, especially for a geographic region that’s majority black and majority people of color.”
Nevertheless, Mason acknowledged that even if the measure passes, there are potential legal obstacles that could hamper a swift transition to statehood.
“It would be really difficult, in terms of legally implementing it. It would be really hard. It takes a Constitutional amendment, it takes action at a federal level and action that we’re not seeing in Congress right now in the state of congressional affairs,” Mason said.

The Doctoral Students Coalition advocated the benefits of unionization during a town hall on Wednesday evening with over 50 doctoral candidates as part of an ongoing campaign to raise awareness about labor concerns for research and teaching assistants at Georgetown.
Led by the DSC, a student organization focused on doctoral student issues, the meeting featured recommendations from the DSC’s working group for unionization. The working group began to consider unionization following the National Labor Relations Board ruling this summer that all graduate students working as research and teaching assistants in private universities are school employees with the right to unionize legitimately.
The coalition’s next immediate steps in the process include starting a campaign and affiliating with an international union.
The group hopes to identify interested sectors of the graduate student population, including master’s students, through outreach and surveys. This will allow them to define the level of interest, according to working group member and philosophy department doctoral candidate Deidre Nelms (GRD ’19).
After examining the results of collective bargaining in more than 30 public and private universities, the working group concluded that in all instances, renegotiated contracts included an increase in stipends along with improvements in access to health care, child care, summer funding and comprehensive work schedules.
DSC members said these outcomes are relevant given the current financial and health benefits afforded to doctoral students by the university. Georgetown’s current wages for TAs fall short of the living wage of $16.45 per hour, as stipulated in Georgetown’s Just Employment Policy. According to the group’s research, Georgetown is the only top university that paid less than the living wage to graduate students.
Nelms said doctoral students have different needs than undergraduate students.
“We are absolutely overdue for a new plan,” Nelms said. “We have the same health insurance as the undergraduate students that we teach for, which is ridiculous, because we are employees. We are adults, some of us have children, dependents and we are more likely to have medical issues than undergraduates.”
Unionizing would ensure a cohesive bargaining structure and build positive relationships with administrators, according to members.
Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor Program Coordinator Nick Wertsch (COL ’09, LAW ’18) said the prospects for a graduate student union at Georgetown are positive due to the existence of the Just Employment Policy adopted in 2005, which ensures a right to unionize and a minimum compensation for all employees.
“No other university has something quite like [the Just Employment Policy],” Wertsch said. “What’s unique about Georgetown is that they’ve institutionally committed to this policy for the last 11 years.”
The group also analyzed potential options as part of its summer research and determined that the American Federation of Teachers union possessed the most desirable credentials.
“We were looking for specific qualities in a union. Experience — we want a union that has experience on academic campuses — and local autonomy. If we were to form a union, we want it to be as democratic as possible,” Nelms said.
Besides its experience with graduate students, AFT offered the working group the possibility of having its own local, independent access to membership data and physical presence in the bargaining process.
“Should we go forward, it is probably in our best interest to affiliate with AFT,” Nelms said.
Once the process begins advancing, union leaders will come to the university to speak to interested students, who will then vote on whether or not they want to unionize.
Nabina Liebow (GRD ’13, GRD ’17), a doctoral candidate in the philosophy department, said the meeting clarified her doubts about unionization and led her to realize its benefits.
“I think the event definitely gave me more information so I can be more aware about what the pros and cons are,” Liebow said. “I think I am definitely more positively pro-unionization than I was before the meeting.”
Meredith Denning (GRD ’16), a doctoral candidate in transregional history, said the benefits of unionization became clear during her time at the University of Waterloo, and said graduates would benefit from engaging in this venture, especially for the purposes of securing better health care benefits.
“It is almost impossible to have children and be a graduate student. Ph.D. students are frequently older than 25, and that’s the time people want to get married, have children, and live a normal adult life, and at the moment that is simply not possible. And it’s not just the working hours, it’s that there is zero institutional support for graduate students with children,” Denning said.
Jake Earl (GRD ’12, GRD ’17), a doctoral candidate in philosophy and member of the working group, said he was initially skeptical about unions but later realized their importance in a graduate student context.
“When I joined the working group, I was skeptical. I don’t think unions are a good thing in every industry, I think that unions sometimes waste the dues that they are paid, that they are sometimes coercive,” Earl said. “But when we dug into graduate student unions, I didn’t see any of these downsides. Universities that have unions thrive, students thrive.”

A potential hate crime in which a perpetrator assaulted and used homophobic language against a Georgetown student off campus the night of Oct. 31 is being investigated by the Georgetown University Police Department and the Metropolitan Police Department.
A campuswide email sent Nov. 1 from GUPD Chief Jay Gruber and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson classified the incident as a hate crime due to the language used during the assault. They also wrote that the suspects were not members of the Georgetown community.
A group of suspected juveniles attacked the student between 34th and Prospect streets NW on Halloween, temporarily seizing the victim’s backpack, then removing and breaking a laptop inside.
MPD and Metro Transit Police apprehended a group of suspects during the early hours of Nov. 1 at the Foggy Bottom Metro station. The MPD took the report and is leading the investigation with assistance from GUPD.
Although Gruber could not disclose details of the assault because of the ongoing investigation, he said the incident was classified as a hate crime because it specifically targeted an aspect of the student’s identity.
“Anytime somebody is disparaged because of their race, their religion, their ethnicity, their gender, their gender orientation, if we believe any of that’s involved, then we consider it a hate crime,” Gruber said.
Gruber said the suspects face charges of assault, robbery and destruction of property, and could potentially face jail time if convicted. Convicted juveniles would be processed through Washington, D.C.’s juvenile justice system.
GU Pride issued a statement on Facebook extending its support to community members whose identities make them vulnerable to violence.
“This event is a sobering reminder that the threat of violence is very real for our community, especially for the more visible trans, gender nonconforming and members of color, especially Black members of our community,” the statement reads. “The threat is close to home.”
Gruber said the last incidents in the area to involve targeted attacks by a large group of people occurred last year on Halloween night when two robberies occurred between 37th and N streets NW and 36th and Prospect streets by a group of masked assailants.
Gruber attributed the spike in crimes during Halloween to the increased activity in the area.
“One thing that Halloween in Georgetown does is attract a lot of people from all over the District and all over the national capital region down to the M Street and Wisconsin Avenue corridor,” Gruber said. “These are outsiders from our area, and we don’t typically see this type of activity in our area.”

“Juveniles” in this context = “Youths” which is the preferred term to avoid mentioning race in most other media and = “We don’t want to report the race because it conflicts with the narrative.”
Other tells . . . “the victim was LGBTQ”  and the GU Pride statement focuses on blacks as victims . . .  “This event is a sobering reminder that the threat of violence is very real for our community, especially for the more visible trans, gender nonconforming and members of color, especially Black members of our community.”
Translation: this was a black on black crime in which black “juveniles” assaulted another black guy based on him being LGBTQ.
Question:  Why whenever we have a white on black hate crime we always hear immediately and incessantly about the race of the white offender, but when it’s the other way, we always hear terms like “juveniles” or “youths”?
It’s the media narrative, folks.  Truth is most hate crimes that occur against students are the result of Middle Easterners or black men.  Ask anyone who knows.  Look at the GUPD reports.  
But because those are approved victim groups and we need to demonize white people, you never hear it, just “juveniles” and “youths.”

Leading up to Georgetown’s update today on the progress of its negotiations with Nike, members of Georgetown’s Licensing and Oversight Committee, which advises the university on its licensing agreeements, called for increased transparency in the contract negotiation process.
Georgetown’s current contract with the footwear manufacturing multinational company is set to expire Dec. 31. Nike officials have yet to sign the university’s code of conduct, which is a requirement of all university vendors.
The code of conduct for Georgetown University licensees includes several clauses related to employment standards, including wages and benefits, working hours, overtime, child labor, forced labor, health and safety and harassment and abuse.
Nike has been frequently criticized for contracting with exploitative sweatshops in foreign countries. Nike is also reported to make use of child labor in its overseas factories.
On Nov. 17, 2015, the workers’ rights enforcement group Worker Rights Consortium released a memo to all of its affiliate colleges and universities, including Georgetown, after the consortium’s request to inspect the Hansae factory, a Nike factory in Vietnam, was rejected.
The WRC made a request to inspect the Hansae factory after learning about ongoing strikes by the factory’s workers in response to the factory’s labor conditions.
In Nov. 2015, Athletes and Advocates for Worker’s Rights, an advocacy group composed of athletes and workers’ rights advocates, sent a letter to University President John J. DeGioia opposing Nike’s unethical business practices.
The LOC will meet with administrators today to discuss the contract negotiations.
If Georgetown chooses to renew its contract with Nike without the company’s agreement to the code of conduct, Nike will be the only company directly affiliated with Georgetown with such an exemption.
Director of Business Policy and Planning and LOC Chair Cal Watson said the committee, which consists of administrators, faculty and students, is still discussing terms with Nike.
“Georgetown University is committed to protecting the rights of workers producing university-licensed apparel. We are in ongoing discussions with Nike now regarding the status of its license with Georgetown,” Watson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
LOC member John Kline, a professor in the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, said many committee members have spoken out about Georgetown’s handling of contract negotiations with Nike, in particular around a lack of transparency.
LOC member Isabelle Teare (COL ’18) said she is displeased with the university’s lack of clarity regarding the current state of negotiations with Nike.
“All I know is we’re in negotiations. … I don’t really take that answer as meaning anything because, who knows what that means?” Teare said. “And also, why is it taking so long? They’re either going to sign our code of conduct and agree to do what they should’ve been doing for the past 15 years, or they’re not. It’s a pretty cut and dry issue. The only thing that ‘negotiating’ means in my mind is trying to figure out loopholes.”
Kline said members of the LOC have spoken out against Georgetown’s sustained negotiation with Nike.
“The LOC knew nothing about the Nike exception until the spring,” Kline said.
Kline said he hoped Nike would sign a new contract and accept LOC oversight of its labor practices.
“I think the ideal outcome would be if Nike simply signed a new contract with Georgetown, accepting the Georgetown code, accepting the monitoring procedure like everybody else. That’s my idea,” Kline said. “Lacking that, I don’t see how Georgetown can uphold its values and extend the contract, or negotiate another exceptional provision for Nike in a new contract. The relationship with Nike would have to end.”
Teare said she also wants Nike to adhere the code and accept the university’s monitors.
“I can’t speak for everyone on the committee, but I don’t think it’s unreasonable to say what we want is for Nike to sign our code of conduct and do what they should’ve been doing for years and years and years, which is adhering to that code,” Teare said. “Nike shouldn’t be given special treatment.”
Nike, Inc. Media Resources did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Kline said however, that due to the nature of the position of the LOC members, the group is relatively powerless in intervening in the negotiations.
“Our mandate is to provide advice to the president,” Kline said. “We don’t have any authority to intervene beyond advising the president. We have requested that we meet directly with President DeGioia. To date, that has not been responded to.”
Kline said student advocacy is important as the university enters the closing phase of negotiations with Nike.
“It was student involvement that got these codes in the first place, 16, 18 years ago,” he said. “And, for these codes to be meaningful, there has to be a demonstration of students remaining interested and concerned about it. This does have to do with upholding Georgetown’s values through a mechanism that the students have been responsible for and are still backing, so it’s not just the LOC—it’s the student body.”

Jim Keady says 
November 4, 2016 at 4:30 pm
No Mr. Kline, Georgetown’s commitment to labor rights should NOT be subject to the interest/activism of the student body on these matters. Would you have said the same about civil rights in the 60s? “We’ll the students aren’t making noise, so I guess we don’t need to say/do anything about it?” The administration and Jesuit community at Georgetown know better, it’s just that they don’t want to deal with this. The powers that be (and the coaches who benefit handsomely from this deal) would much rather the students just be quiet so the Nike contract could be executed without incident – worker rights be damned. You have a responsibility to be intellectually honest about this, so please exercise that responsibility. 
Peace, Jim Keady

Negotiations over Washington, D.C.’s Universal Paid Leave Act of 2015 have stalled after criticism of the bill’s proposed funding plan devolved into an exchange between Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) at the Council-Mayor breakfast meeting Oct. 25.
The act, which has faced criticism from Bowser in the past due to its proposed cost, which she considers too high, would guarantee workers employed in the District up to 12 weeks of annual paid family and medical leave. Under the proposed plan, paid leave benefits would be funded through a business payroll tax. A vote on the bill has been delayed since last year due to Bowser’s doubts about its funding and cost to city taxpayers.
Mendelson said he hopes the bill will be voted on by Nov. 15, but Bowser noted it would take three weeks for the Office of the Chief Financial Officer to score the bill, thereby pushing the vote back. In order to pass, the bill must be voted upon twice before the legislative session ends in December.
At the meeting, Bowser questioned Mendelson on why he had not led a more transparent process in finalizing the details of the bill. Mendelson said his process has not been secretive, but rather Bowser’s staff has been uncooperative and unwilling to meet with his office in order to discuss the bill’s specifics.
Director of Communications for Mendelson’s office Lindsey Walton said the development of the bill has been open for public comment since its introduction last year, and Bowser has not worked well with Mendelson.
“The Council has been more than transparent when it comes to this legislation. There have been three public hearings on the bill and there was a discussion draft circulated along with the draft print of the bill, which is virtually never done with regard to council legislation,” Walton wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The Chairman has collaborated with several other Councilmembers in the crafting of the final version of the bill.”
Bowser later requested that Mendelson release more specific information on the bill in order to properly inform her office as well as his fellow councilmembers on its funding, specifically how the act’s $400 million cost will affect taxpayers and business growth.
Communications and Community Outreach Coordinator for Councilmember Elissa Silverman (I-At Large) Ashley Fox contended that deliberations on the bill have been cooperative and inclusive up to this point, and she has high hopes for the future of the bill. Silverman was one of the first proponents of the bill along with Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large).
“It’s been a pretty collaborative process so far. I think Mayor Bowser is interested in making sure that the public is included, but procedurally a lot of the next steps lie within the chairman’s office. So it’s a balance,” Fox said. “We are optimistic about a collaborative process going forward and I would say that it has been collaborative so far.”
Fox said the council is looking to alleviate business concerns while implementing the paid family and medical leave program.
“We’re really trying to think about what makes the most sense for a fair bill. So what does a fair bill look like? And what does a bill look like that still fits the needs of the people who really need it the most?” Fox said. “There has been a lot of conversation back and forth about how many weeks of leave is enough, how many weeks is affordable, and so what we’re really trying to do is incorporate as many concerns as we can.”
The Campaign for D.C. Paid Family Leave Manager Joanna Blotner said she would like to see D.C. officials working in a closer fashion to achieve the common goal of paid family leave. Blotner said she believes further changes to the District’s paid leave will be conducted in a more positive manner in the future.
“From our perspective, it would be nice to see all of our elected officials working together in the best interest for working families in D.C. and having everybody positively contribute to the conversation and how to make this the best possible paid leave program for the District,” Blotner said. “We’ve been really pleased with how Chairman Mendelson has been meeting with us.”

Georgetown University recognized a professor of oncology and pharmacology who is working to cure cancer, a law school professor whose research is shaping the decision-making of the U.S. Supreme Court and another who is changing how the process of aging is addressed with the President’s Award for Distinguished Scholar-Teachers at the annual 2016 Fall Faculty Convocation on Oct. 21.
Professor of oncology and pharmacology Anton Wellstein, professor of law Donald Langevoort and professor of psychology Darlene Howard received this year’s awards, which recognize excellence in both research and teaching at Georgetown.
Provost Robert Groves said the medal recognizes those who set a standard of academic excellence in both research and in teaching.
“This medal was designed to recognize those faculty among us who excel both in research and teaching effectiveness. They, therefore, teach us every day that these two sides of an academic are not in conflict but can be jointly achieved,” Groves said.
University President John J. DeGioia said in his address to the convocation in Gaston Hall that Howard was awarded for her passion both in and out of the classroom.
“All of you who know her know that she’s a generous mentor, known for her ability to bring out an enthusiasm in her students, a passion for the field and a dedication to the rigors of conducting scientific studies that sustains them into their future,” DeGioia said.
Howard, whose work focuses on how cognitive and neural systems decline and progress during aging, said she came to Georgetown because she wanted to be at a place where both aspects of academia are valued.
“There are a lot of places you can go where you’re almost punished for caring about your teaching because the pressure of researching and publishing is too heavy,” Howard said. “I fell in love with teaching as a graduate student, and that’s the reason I came to Georgetown.”
Howard not only stands out for her research abilities, but for her teaching skills, according to one of Howard’s students Shea Crowley (COL ’17).
“Professor Howard really exemplified what a professor should be, which is a knowledgeable lecturer and an expert in his or her field. Howard is also an interesting person who cares about her students,” Crowley said.
Wellstein said good college professors are those who balance teaching and research.
“There’s no conflict between teaching and research; they go hand in hand,” Wellstein said. “I can use what I’m researching in teaching and what I’m teaching in my research. They feed off of each other.”
Wellstein’s work has contributed not only to the Georgetown community but to the broader field of oncology, pharmacology and cancer research, according to DeGioia.
“Few have done more to advance this next generation of research and researchers in the critical field of oncology than Anton. And we’re all better here at Georgetown because of his presence,” DeGioia said.
Langevoort, whose work focuses on contracts and securities regulation, said a lot of his research is motivated and enhanced by the courses he teaches in the Georgetown University Law Center.
“I’ve gotten some of my best ideas for what I write about by standing up in front of a classroom and having a discussion with students,” Langevoort said. “They ask great questions and if you listen carefully, you realize that there are different ways of thinking about these topics. Plus, I love talking about the subjects that I study.”
DeGioia described how the influence of Langevoort’s research has reached as far as the Supreme Court.
“His influential scholarship has been cited in opinions issued by justices of the Supreme Court and continues to shape discussions of insider trading and securities litigation reform,” DeGioia said. “He provides a model for multidisciplinary scholarship bringing together law, psychology and finance to address important issues in governance and business practices.”
All three professors said they were extremely surprised to receive the award, yet were humbled by the recognition.
“As far as we could tell, there aren’t other major universities that have an award like this,” Langevoort said. “There certainly are awards that recognize institutions’ best scholars, and most universities have some kind of teaching merit recognition, but Georgetown bolsters the point that research and teaching are equally important.”

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced Oct. 28 the termination of 100 workers over the next week as part of wider efforts to balance an anticipated $290 million budget shortfall for fiscal year 2017.
The layoffs, which affect members of WMATA’s management and lower-tier workers, were part of Metro General Manager Paul Wiedefeld’s plan to eliminate 500 positions this year, announced in June. In May, WMATA laid off 20 station managers, including seven senior managers, ahead of the start of Safetrack, its $60 million, yearlong maintenance overhaul.
The proposed Metro budget for the 2018 fiscal year, which is pending approval by the Metro board of directors, plans to compensate for Metro’s declining ridership and financial woes by laying off 1,000 workers, cutting employee health care expenses and hiking fares by 10 cents.
Wiedefeld emphasized in an Oct. 28 email to WMATA staff that the layoffs stemmed from attempts to balance its budget shortfall.
“I anticipate that Metro will have to make many difficult decisions to balance the budget,” Wiedefeld wrote. “Over the next few days, Human Resources will be working with the executive team to notify about 100 employees about impacts to their jobs due to the budget actions we are taking.”
Stephen Fuller, a senior advisor and director of special projects at the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University, said the layoffs this year resulted from an unwillingness to raise rates for riders. As no extra revenue is expected for Metro, there needed to be cutbacks to fill the budget deficit.
“Politically, none of the local jurisdictions are keen on raising the rates, but no one wants to contribute more money either, so you have to cut expenses,” Fuller said. “And the only way is, if you can’t raise revenues, and you have a budget deficit, you have to cut service and one way of doing that is to get rid of jobs.”
Forty-five of the 100 terminated employees belonged to the Amalgamated Transit Union, which represents 6,000 Metrobus and Metrorail operators and mechanics in the metropolitan area.
The union’s local chapter Communications Coordinator David Stephen said the union was willing to cooperate with WMATA to prevent future cutbacks.
“Making cutbacks and looking at ways to decrease the size and decrease the operation of this system is not the direction WMATA should be moving in,” Stephen said. “So, we find it regretful, and we are hopeful that we will be able to find other means of making sure that WMATA is able to make up its shortcomings.”
Fuller noted the cutbacks might be a way to notify the local officials running WMATA of further economic problems in the region’s future if money is not raised quickly. According to Fuller, around a quarter of commuters use Metro. With the cutbacks, that number could further be reduced.
“The implications of these cutbacks send a message that may get the attention of local elected officials,” Fuller said. “They may be more willing to cough up the money necessary and make the system run more efficiently.”
Fuller cited the inability of the governments of Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C., to work together to create funding for the Metro as the main reason for the financial deficit. He said 100 layoffs would be just the beginning for budget cuts.
“This is a test on whether or not we can get our act together and the elected officials have failed. They have not come together and declared an emergency,” Fuller said. “What you have in the 100 jobs and some reduction in service is the tip of the iceberg.”
Stephen suggested that WMATA management cut back the amount of outside private contractors they hire to evaluate the Metro, saying the expenses incurred by Safetrack could have been circumvented if
Wiedefeld had consulted more with union members.
“There have been a number of studies and consultants that have been brought in in various areas of WMATA that has literally cost the system tens of millions of dollars,” Stephen said. “What the system has not done, or what the authorities have not done, is actively engage and implement the ideas of their workforce.”

Georgetown University College Democrats and College Republicans expanded upon key issues from this year’s election cycle during the upperclassman debate in the Healey Family Student Center Great Room on Tuesday.
GUCR, GUCD, the Georgetown Program Board and the Georgetown Institute for Politics and Public Service co-sponsored the event to provide an in-depth conversation on each party’s platform before Election Day on Nov. 8th. Issues addressed during the debate ranged from how to alleviate college debt and mitigate climate change to the Syrian refugee crisis and what should be done with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
The event was moderated by CNN Senior Producer Brooke Brower and Ashley Spillane, former president of Rock the Vote, which seeks to mobilize the vote of young people, and current member of the GU Politics advisory board.
Former GUCD President Matthew Gregory (SFS ’17) introduced the debate, discussed the nature of political debates in this electoral cycle and said this election cycle has underscored the necessity for both parties to pursue a deeper discussion of substantive political issues.
“Democrat or Republican, I think we can all agree that we as a nation can do better than some of what we’ve received during this 2016 race,” Gregory said. “Tonight we gather to elevate the political discourse, we gather together to discuss the issues.”
For the first section of the debate on social issues, Meredith Forsyth (SFS ’19), Jessica Scoratow (COL ’18) and Mattie Haag (COL ’18) represented the Democratic Party, and Zachary Hughbanks (COL ’18), Harry Clow (COL ’19) and Mitchell Tu (SFS ’16) represented the Republican Party.
Forsyth said the Affordable Care Act revolutionized the American health care system.
“The Democratic Party believes that health care is a human right, not a privilege, and thanks to [President] Obama, we now have 20 million Americans under the Affordable Care Act who hadn’t been insured before, so we believe we have to protect and uphold Obamacare,” Forsyth said.
Hughbanks said the government should shift the focus toward privatizing health care and creating a more laissez-faire system.
“Obamacare has just destroyed middle-class and working-class communities across the nation,” Hughbanks said. “We need to return to a free-market reform, repeal Obamacare and implement an effective solution as outlined by Speaker [of the House] Paul Ryan.”
Shifting from health care to race relations, Tu said initiatives should focus less on blaming police officers and instead target the root of the problem by eradicating poverty and improving schooling.
“The solution of course isn’t by blaming police or attacking law enforcement,” Tu said. “It’s fixed by education reform, it’s fixed by economic control, its fixed by economic growth.”
Haag, a Democrat, said proper training for police is essential to reduce all differential minority treatment.
“There is empirical evidence that police are not trained enough and that they are actively shooting and being aggressive toward people of color versus white people,” Haag said.
Another major social issue addressed was abortion rights. Hughbanks said the issue was not about women’s rights.
“This isn’t an issue about women’s rights as much as it is an issue about the rights of the unborn, so what we’re saying before you’re born you have no rights and you can just be killed, ” Hughbanks said. “My position and the position of the Republican Party is that this is not a women’s issue; it’s an issue of protecting the rights of those of us who are unborn and have no other protections.”
Scoratow said that the Republican Party is hypocritical for being in favor of a woman’s right to choose.
“I think that if the Republican Party would like to be in support of a right to life, then they should be in support of things that ensure people’s right to life, like gun control,” Scoratow said. “It is really a basic issue of bodily autonomy for women.”
Joel Elkins (SFS ’18), Jawad Pullin (COL ’18), and Max Rosner (COL ’18) spoke for the Democrats on issues of finance, while the Republican side included Stephen Yin, Christopher Crocki and Michalel Parmiter.
Rosner said it is important for the next administration to raise the minimum wage, so that those earning it can at least afford to pay for their basic living expenses.
“If you were to work 40 hours per week at $7.25, making around $15,000, honestly that’s pathetic. If you’re working 40 hours per week you should at least be able to feed yourself and feed your family, so the Democratic Party, at least, unlike the standard bearer of the Republican Party believes that wages are not too high,” Rosner said. “The Democratic Party believes that $15 should be the starting talking point for minimum wage.”
In response to the Democratic argument, Yin said that raising the minimum wage could hamper the economy and lead to lower rates of employment.
“The question shouldn’t be whether we should raise the minimum wage or not, but rather what’s the best solution to get people to average salaries without reducing their purchasing power,” Yin said. “An increase in the minimum wage could reduce job growth.”
According to Parmiter, instituting higher education options other than four-year universities is critical to ensure students have the experience necessary to secure professional employment.
“I think what you have to look at instead of the affordability of college is the job prospects after it,” Parmiter said. “I think more people in America should go to a trade school or a two-year college, without taking out these massive loans, and then when they get out they can actually secure a job.”
To end the debate, Alex Coopersmith (COL ’19), Matt Hinson (SFS ’17), Madison Pravecek (SFS ’19) represented the Democrats, and Clow, Erica Tillotson (COL ’18), Hunter Estes (SFS ’19), and Richard Howell (SFS ’19) represented the Republican side to discuss foreign policy.
Hinson argued that although Obama may have erred on the side of caution, his policies in Syria have yielded successes and that Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Clinton’s policies will yield to even greater reductions in loss of life.
“We have engaged in Syria, we have been striking ISIS, ISIS has lost over 40 percent of its territory so far, and we have had the success of causing Bashar al-Assad to reduce his chemical arsenal,” Hinson said. “Looking forward to the Clinton administration, Hillary Clinton is going to take a very active approach in protecting civilians in Syria.”
Howell emphasized the Obama administration’s interventions as insufficient and argued in favor of the deployment of ground troops in the region.
“From the beginning of the Arab Spring the United States has not done anything effectively in Syria. … Later Obama promised a red line if Assad used chemical weapons and that red line was crossed,” Hinson said. “We need to work with our partners for real, assure Turkey and Israel that we will commit troops to the region.”
Other students, such as Shanzeg Hameed (SFS ’17), said the debate was successful as a forum to further educate students about political discourse.
“I think it’s good that Georgetown has these sorts of events and opportunities for people to be able to discuss their opinions and to stimulate discussion and conversation,” Hameed said.

The next U.S. president should develop a strong but sensitive American presence in Asia, according to a panel of five foreign policy experts in Copley Formal Lounge on Wednesday.
The conversation, which concerned the future of the United States’ Asia policy, is the first event organized by weekly international relations journal The Caravel. Panelists included National Security Council Director of Affairs Michael Green, Chief Bureau Director In-sun Kang of Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo, Brookings Institute Senior Fellow Richard Bush III and State Department Bureau of East Asian Affairs Deputy Assistant Secretary Walter Douglas.
Douglas said that a key component of America’s policy towards Asia will revolve around whether Congress passes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal to loosen trade restrictions between several Asian countries and the United States. Both Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump have publicly opposed the deal.
“Going forward, our number one effort in the rebalancing of Asia is to get the TPP approved,” Douglas said. “The president is going to be working hard on that. You’ve seen the news reports and he is calibrating on how he is going to do it. We plan to leave that to the White House.”
According to Douglas, relations between the United States and Asia have been continuously improving through collaboration with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Free Trade Area, the current trade agreement in effect in the region, which the TPP would augment but not replace.
“We now celebrate 40 years of working with ASEAN. Under the Obama administration we placed a mission, like an embassy, to ASEAN in Jakarta and we have an ambassador there,” Douglas said. “We’ve really stepped up relations with ASEAN. Our soft power is such a strong force that people are willing to give us their support even where there is tension in their government’s relations with us.”
Green said the United States must consider its policy toward China as a part of a larger Asia policy and avoid employing simple, blanket theories to guide policy regarding the nation.
“Don’t make the mistake of going for a simplistic description of U.S.-China relations and belief in what China is,” Green said. “It’s more complicated.”
According to Bush, many countries in the region depend on and have good relations with both the United States and China.
“There are many countries in Asia who depend on China economically and so China’s condition is very important to them,” Bush said. “They, however, depend on the U.S. for security.”
Bush said Trump’s proposal for South Korea to receive nuclear weapons to ease the need for United States support at the border with North Korea would be ill-advised, despite potentially reducing the U.S. military budget.
“In the mid-1980s pro-labor Democrats were saying the same thing about Japan, that they are getting a free ride in security. They were wrong then and Donald Trump is wrong now,” Bush said.
The next presidential administration must be proactive when it comes to North Korea, according to Bush.
“Be ready for an early crisis with North Korea. I fully expect that North Korea will want to test the new administration in some way,” Bush said. “The more that can be done in advance of that actuality, the better.”
Green said the United States should appoint foreign policy officials who are very familiar with Asia, given the rising importance of the region for the United States. Previous administrations appointed a disproportionate number of individuals whose focus had always been Europe and NATO allies as representatives to Asia, according to Green.
“The next president has got to appoint secretaries and deputies who really know Asia,” Green said. “You can’t deal with the complexities of the region and create policies accordingly if the hired officials are Atlanticists.”
The Caravel Editor-in-Chief Andrea Moneton (SFS ’18) said events such as the panel will allow the publication to not only report on but also to look critically at foreign policy issues.
“We wanted to host an event and invite expert speakers to campus in order to move from a space where we cover international news and events about international affairs to one where we also participate in shaping the conversation,” Moneton wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Moneton said the event’s focus on Asian foreign policy was chosen as part of a larger effort by the publication to incorporate domestic politics into its work this election cycle, especially given that Asia has been a primary focus of foreign affairs discussions this election season.
“U.S. elections matter to the entire world. That’s especially true with this election cycle, where no U.S. engagements with the international community would be safe should Donald Trump be elected,” Moneton wrote.
