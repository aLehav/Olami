Lee Kuan Yew, the founder of modern Singapore, said that his political model for the state could only be achieved in small countries. Precise as ever, he stated that in countries larger than Jamaica his model of rule of law would not hold the population in lock-step. His remark tells us two things about promoting development: First, no model can be universally applied to non-democratic states; second, only with exceptionally tight control can democratization be slowed to a crawl. Promoting sequencing promotes leaders like Lee Kuan Yew; men whose goal is to maintain law and order with no dissent. Thomas Jefferson claimed that dissent is an integral part of good government. If so, the much lauded anti-democratic model of development is a step in the wrong direction.
As Thomas Carothers argues, the dream is sequencing: that a benevolent elderly sage will gracefully lead his country to democracy, and like Nelson Mandela, relinquish power come the end of his term in office. A quick glance around the world reveals the fallacy of this method – Egypt’s president Hosni Mubarak imposes strict and narrow limits on political activity in the interest of control and security all the while promising democratic reform. Soon his son Gamal will take the reins of the dynasty. Two case studies of the process sequentialism prioritizes are the Democratic Republic of the Congo first under Patrice Lumumba, then Mobutu Sese Seko, and the Philippines under Ferdinand Marcos, then Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. These two are clear examples of a state trading democratic institutions for rule of law – a trend not sought by democracy-promoters.
There are even `exceptions’ that prove to be the norm – most widely heralded is South Korea’s slow, `steady’ democratization. But this transition was more similar to the populist overthrow of Marcos in the Philippines than the sequentialist dream of democracy evolving out of rule of law. South Korea’s gradually more liberal dictators Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo succumbed to public pressure, eventually leading to the presidency of Kim Young-sam.
South Korea, the Philippines, Democratic Republican of the Congo and Egypt show what follows from prioritizing rule of law above democratization. The contrasting example of Mandela respecting the democratic norm of relinquishing power shows us much about the legitimacy of a regime, both to domestic and international observers. Vladimir Putin’s `dictatorship of law’; today faced by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, is a pertinent example of this trend in action. It does not lead to democracy, and, as the International Relations Club’s U.S. Foreign Policy Debate addressed this afternoon in White-Gravenor, it achieves neither security nor development.
andela relinquishing power set a powerful example across Africa, one that resonates across Botswana, Mauritius, Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania and Kenya. The latter two, formerly British colonies, are examples of how post-colonial transitions to independence function as democratic transition processes. The British, unlike the Dutch and French, were fond of creating democratic institutions in their colonies. People’s assemblies like the Indian National Congress were emblems of British benevolence; they believed their role was not purely to subjugate but also to civilize. To the British, it was key that democracy was operative so that upon becoming independent, the new states could function successfully.
The Congo, Indonesia, the Philippines and Algeria are all examples of colonial transitions in which a state attained independence without a long-running democratic framework ready to take over. Unsurprisingly, they all fell to military rule or cult of personality authoritarianism. One can argue that the colonial experience of India is case-in-point for sequencing, but to do so is to ignore the historical narrative. The former Viceroy of India, Louis Mountbatten, oversaw the transition, as we would call it today, with greater Indian autonomy and finally, a British departure. Cases like Egypt under Mubarak are different because Mubarak will not leave office within his term limits.
Sequencing neither works as a process towards democracy, nor as a guarantee of civil society under political stability. It has a high frequency of resulting in repressive authoritarianism, as modern Russia shows, particularly with violations of human rights, as Anna Politkovskaya’s death frighteningly reveals. The example of India’s democratization is arguably a glimmer of hope, but as Lee Kuan Yew’s point about the Singaporean model shows, no example can be universalized into a typology that both serves all circumstances and fits them well. As the United States undertakes its first quadrennial diplomatic review we must bear in mind what priorities are most needed. Eschewing the full gamut of state responsibility for strategic effectiveness and results now only means a sloppy job and further strife.

Endowed with a $17 million gift from Arthur (COL ’54) and Nancy Calcagnini, Georgetown will complete construction on a new retreat center in Bluemont, Va., by 2011, according to a university press release.
The Calcagnini Contemplative Center will rest on a 55-acre plot of land located 75 minutes away from the Hilltop in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Consisting of a Catholic chapel, community and dining halls and 28 cabins for up to 78 students, the center will house students of all faiths for various religious retreats, including ESCAPE.
“I can’t think of a more important investment than to provide young people with the opportunity for quiet introspection and a chance to ask questions of themselves,” Calcagnini said in the press release. “This center will provide the potential to enrich every student for a lifetime. It is an important part of achieving the Jesuit philosophy of educating the whole person.”
The project was originally slated to be finished in 2008, but permit delays prevented its completion. ESCAPE, a retreat for freshmen and transfer students, has been housed at Shepherd’s Springs Outdoor Ministry Center in Sharpsburg, Md., for nearly 11 years. The ESCAPE program was previously endowed by the Calcagninis with a $1.5 million gift.
“Arthur and Nancy epitomize the core Catholic and Jesuit values at the heart of this university,” University President John J. DeGioia said in the press release. “Over the years the Calcagninis have endowed funds for the Catholic, Jewish and Muslim chaplaincies on campus as well as student scholarships, Medical Center research and other projects. Their gift to establish a contemplative center will animate the lives and deepen the faiths of generations of students to come.”
Calcagnini, a member of the university’s board of directors and the retired chair and CEO of Lombard and Co., and his wife, previously the managing director of Credit Suisse First Boston, feel strongly about the importance of reflection and the Catholic and Jesuit influence at Georgetown.
“Arthur’s commitment is personal as well as financial. Every year for the past 20 years, he has participated in at least one ESCAPE weekend and has given the alumni talk to the students. His vision is key to making this project a reality,” Rev. Philip L. Boroughs, S.J., vice president for mission and ministry, said in the press release.

Inside the newest building on campus sits an electronic haven stocked with the advancements of the 21st century and staffed by students with a passion for technology.
While the rest of the university community relies on University Information Services, the McDonough School of Business Technology Center provides technology solutions for business school undergraduate students and MBA students.
SB Chief Technology Officer John Carpenter said the business school needs to have its own technology center in order to retain an edge over its peers.
“There are a lot of things that the school of business has to do to compete with other business schools across the nation and in the world, and some of those things are technology,” Carpenter said. “It’s the same thing for the Medical Center. It’s the same thing for the Law [Center].”
Carpenter has the final say on all technology matters in the business school. MSB students, faculty and staff know him as Carp, even though his gruff demeanor and abrupt email replies seem to belie the familiarity his nickname creates.
A former Navy pilot who specialized in Navy Technical Intelligence, Carpenter describes himself as “real old,” though he says the undergraduate student staff keeps him abreast of changing uses for technology since his arrival 17 years ago.
The MSB had a tech center before the rest of the university did, according to Carpenter. In its early years, it provided networking for the university and email for all faculty and staff. At the time Carpenter was hired, the MSBTC specialized in technology for business school students that no one else could provide, a condition that still exists today.
Despite his high praise for the tech center’s capabilities, Carpenter hesitated to comment on where technology for the MSBTC is headed. He gave examples, however, of projects that are under consideration.
One such venture is the rollout of Dropbox, an online service that automatically syncs a user’s files across computers, which students could use to work on projects or share group class work. He noted, though, that the Dropbox project was in the earliest of stages and could end up going nowhere. The idea for the project came about after chats with a student staff member.
Undergraduate students who work at MBSTC hail from every school except the School of Nursing and Health Studies and span a variety of majors. Each academic year, a round of new staff is hired. New hires get basic training and then specialize in one of four areas: technology and desk services, audio/visual services, web development or training other staff. Most students specialize in technology and A/V, according to Talia Hamlin (COL ’11), who has worked in the MSBTC since her freshman year.
Hamlin, far from being a computer science geek, majors in anthropology. After a few years on the job, Hamlin is comfortable at the tech center – she casually chats with Carp, she has seen full-time staff members come and go, and most significantly, she saw the transition from the MSBTC’s old homes in the Car Barn and Riverside classrooms to their sleek new Rafik B. Hariri Building headquarters.
“It’s changed so much since I started here and gotten so much more professional,” Hamlin said, noting the uniform blue shirts staff members are now required to wear.
The professional polo does not stop Hamlin from nonchalantly greeting full-time staff members, however.
The lighthearted atmosphere does not interfere with customer service and any time a lost-looking or frustrated MSB student approaches the tech center window, the conversation halts and a student staffer tackles the problem.
Joining Hamlin on one shift were MSBTC staff Ishita Kohli (SFS ’13) and Michael Crouch (MSB ’13).
All three are international students. Hamlin is from Madrid, Spain, Kohli comes from Dubai and India, and Crouch hails from South Africa. They laughed when they realized they all were international students working together and admitted that it was not the norm.
They were not sure what drew all of them to work at the tech center.
“Maybe international students like technology,” Talia said.
“Or maybe we need the money,” Kohli added.
