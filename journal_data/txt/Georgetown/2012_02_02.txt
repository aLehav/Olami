The Georgetown University Student Associate Senate voted unanimously Sunday to authorize the Student Life Committee to investigate the university’s ban on the operation of student businesses on campus.
University policies regarding concessions and student businesses currently state that students living in university housing may not engage in private business or commercial activities in their residence. The ban prohibits students from using a room address, telephone line or Internet connection to conduct any type of business activity.
The Buyback Brothers, four students who tried to operate a book buyback program in Red Square during final exams last spring, first raised the issue with Vice Speaker Nate Tisa (SFS ’14).
The Buyback Brothers said they were forced off campus by Department of Public Safety officers after a university administrator reported them. Since then, the group has used a licensed vendor truck outside the front gates to conduct its business.
“The students appreciated our service. Some professors even sell back books to us, too,” Jordan Green (COL’12), one of the company’s founders, said.
Green added that previously, residence assistants and hall directors didn’t have problems with the company going into dorms.
“It seems like the university policy is targeted against the students,” Sam Kane (SFS ’14), a member of the Buyback Brothers, said. “We wouldn’t have any business if the bookstore wasn’t ripping people off.”
Senate Speaker Adam Talbot argued that the university policy is unequally applied across student businesses.
H2Bro Delivery, a student-run business that delivers snacks and drinks to dorms, was used as an example of a student business that should not be allowed by the university policy, but has had not been sanctioned by the administration.
“The Buyback Brothers was competing with the bookstore. If you look at a lot of student-run businesses, in some sense, they are completely non-cannibalistic with other auxiliary business, and they operate just fine,” Talbot said.
Tisa also suggested that the ban is largely enforced against businesses that compete with auxiliary services.
“There are student businesses that operate despite this ban, but not because they have special permission,” he said. “It’s interesting that the only student businesses on the university’s radar are those that cut into the margins of the auxiliary services, like the eFollett bookstore. There’s definitely an element of monopoly involved.”
According to The BuyBack Brothers, no concrete explanations to the inconsistent enforcement of the policy have been given, despite multiple attempts to contact the administration.
The bill calls upon the university administration to establish a framework for the student business to register and operate legally on campus.
“We would like to see a more moderate approach, whereby students have some kind of process for getting their ideas approved,” Green said. “Ultimately, we are looking for a more comprehensive set of policies that serve to protect all students while at the same time aim to encourage innovative ideas that add value to our campus.”

The Student Life Report Committee presented key recommendations for improving campus engagement at a press conference for their upcoming report Sunday.
“Over the last 5 months we’ve sought out what we like to think of as the limitless upside of student happiness on campus,” report committee chair Shuo Yan Tan (SFS ’12) said.
According to the report’s Editor-in-Chief Matt Hoyt (COL ’12), the Student Life Report investigates aspects of student organization advisory boards, intellectual and student life from a qualitative and quantitative perspective.
The document, which is still in draft form, is slated to be finished and released within the next two weeks. It is the first comprehensive report about student life completed since 1999.
According to Georgetown University Student Association Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12), the report is intended to help provide a better framework for how student money should be allocated. It offers suggestions for improving five student advisory boards including the Student Activities Commission, CSJ, the Advisory Board for Club Sports, the Media Board, the Performing Arts Advisory Council and the Georgetown Program Board, as well as various recommendations for institutional and intellectual improvement.
Many of these recommendations call for expansion of student space, improved transparency among the funding boards and better centralization of information.
The report also includes more specific recommendations, such as combining What’s After Dark and the Georgetown Program Board into one group and moving the Lecture Fund under the purview of GPB.
The committee also analyzed data from questionnaires including the Senior Survey, Enrolled Student Survey and Civic Engagement Survey. Based on this analysis, the committee suggested that there is a positive relationship between engagement in Georgetown-related activities and student satisfaction, calling for an investigation into students that do little to engage in activities on campus.
Hoyt said that he was surprised to discover that board members for the club sports advisory board felt that their needs and interests were often overlooked in favor of Georgetown’s intramural sports.
“People very involved felt alienated and were a distant second in priorities in the eyes of the university and [Yates Field House],” he said.
The committee has recommended a tiered structure for organizing club sports in order to better allocate resources.
To research the issues tackled in the report, GUSA members and volunteers traveled to college campuses, including Stanford, American, and William & Mary Universities to study their institutions and framework for campus life.
The Student Life Report Committee listed William & Mary’s a capella council and Stanford undergraduates’ complete control over their student activities funds as noteworthy aspects of other colleges. Georgetown’s Center for Social Justice stood out when compared to similar organizations at other universities.
“[CSJ is] way ahead of the field and will only get better,” Tan said.
The committee is currently seeking feedback on the report from various campus organizations before the final document is publicly released. GUSA hopes to meet with University President John J. DeGioia to discuss the report.

After months of recruiting student groups and revising its constitution, the Student Group Union will hold its first executive committee election Feb. 5 through Feb. 8.
The SGU, an initiative designed to facilitate better coordination among student organizations, was launched in October with the hope of resolving the frustration some groups have felt in their dealings with the university administration and the Student Activities Commission.
“Since the kickoff, we’ve been building momentum, raising awareness and gathering feedback,” Co-Chair Eitan Paul (SFS ’12) said. “We’ve been communicating with numerous groups to make sure SGU is something they feel comfortable about. Overwhelmingly, student groups have been incredibly excited about this opportunity.”
When the group got off the ground last semester, students expressed concerns regarding the classification of student organizations as well as the representation system that SGU plans to use.
The executive committee will be comprised of one representative from each of 11 categories of student organizations: media, performing arts, volunteer, advocacy, cultural, political, religious, common interest, club sports, student government and non-advisory board groups.
Sixty-five student organizations had signed the constitution as of press time, according to Paul.
Each member organization will be granted one vote for the executive committee member in its group category. To be eligible for election, students must have previously been or currently be an officer in a Georgetown student organization. Voting will be instant runoff, meaning that voters will rank candidates on their ballots.
Once the executive committee is elected next week, SGU will be fully operational.
“There could be a potential misconception that this could be just another form of bureaucracy, but it is important for people to know that this is a paradigm shift in how student resources are used,” SGU steering committee member Emma Green (COL ’12) said.
Following elections, student group leaders will meet once per semester to discuss their ideas and needs, while the executive committee will meet every 15 days to address any concerns raised by SGU members and to foster better connections among clubs.
“The vast majority of groups rarely connect to one another, so often it’s difficult for student groups to navigate through the complicated bureaucracy within the university,” Paul said.

With less than three weeks left for public comment on proposed updates to the District’s 30-year-old food truck regulations, members of both sides of the debate are stepping up efforts to ensure that the new laws best serve their own interests.
Under the new regulations, food trucks will be able to park at any legal parking spot so long as they pay the meter, though vendors selling desserts will not be allowed to remain stationary for more than 10 minutes unless they have a line of customers. All trucks will be permitted to operate until 10 p.m. on weekdays and 1 a.m. on weekends. The regulations allow them to stay open later than their current hours, but trucks must still close earlier than restaurants.
D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs Director Nicholas Majett explained the proposed rules at the monthly meeting of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E on Monday.
“We thought [the regulations] struck a balance between the brick and mortar stores, who obviously have a right to survive … and the mobile vending trucks, who also have a right to operate their businesses,” he said.
The rules would also provide for the creation of vending development zones intended to give community members a say regarding the number of vendors allowed in their neighborhood.
“It’s basically meant to really allow the local community and businesses and business associations to work with us to really develop a public space management plan for vending for their particular area that works best for them,” DCRA Legislative Affairs Specialist Helder Gil said.
“The zones are not envisioned to exclude vending. You can’t create a zone and say we don’t want vending in our area,” he added.
Food truck owners said the new regulations would be an improvement over the District’s current policies, which strictly limit areas in which trucks are allowed to operate. But they are also lobbying to strike clauses governing the time restriction on dessert trucks, operating hours and the creation of the vending development zones.
Patrick Rathbone, owner of the Big Cheese Truck, helped launch an online petition two weeks ago with the Washington, D.C. Food Trucks Association to have the rules removed. By the beginning of the month, the petition had received 568 online signatures.
While truck owners are mostly happy with the new regulations, neighborhood restauranteurs who hoped the legislation would place tighter restrictions on the city’s mobile eateries were less satisfied.
At Monday’s ANC meeting, Andrew Kline, an attorney with the Restaurant Association Metropolitan Washington, argued that food trucks were usurping public space and that DCRA should stipulate that food trucks only operate on fixed sites.
According to Rathbone, restaurant owners are more concerned with limiting competition than with protecting public space.
“We’re lobbying to get the rules passed and they’re lobbying to get the rules changed,” he said. “They want to restrict competition, that’s what it boils down to.”
Some neighbors also expressed concern about the effect of food trucks parked in residential areas. On Monday, the ANC passed rules banning food trucks from operating out of residential parking permit spaces.
But Rathbone reiterated that residents had little to worry about.
“Food trucks aren’t going to go park in a residential area because there’s not enough foot traffic,” he said. “It’s a non-issue.”
The 30-day public comment period for the bill ends Feb. 20, after which the D.C. Council will vote on the regulations. If approved, the rules will come into immediate effect.

While the Student Activities Commission is still ironing out the details of its new policies, student leaders praised the changes implemented so far this semester.
The new allocation system, which was adopted in October, requires student organizations to submit semester budgets, which allow them to internally allocate funds. Groups previously submitted programming arcs that proposed events requiring designated amounts of money.
Groups submit event proposals online and are only required to meet with the SAC commissioners if an event involves a significant risk factor.
“The system is a big improvement from … where SAC came from,” SAC Vicechair Eric Neidle (COL ’14) said. “It’s still new, so we’re still ironing out a lot of kinks and small details and starting to look at minor changes to make to the system this semester.”
Student leaders agree that more, smaller reforms could be made to the budgeting system.
“I hope [SAC continues] to support and encourage the organizations and streamline its processes,” Georgetown University Grilling Society President Chris Griffin (MSB ’13) wrote in an email.
According to Neidle, unplanned funding for events not included on clubs’ original budgets has been both the most popular yet most challenging aspect of SAC reform.
“One thing that was not anticipated and that we need to make sure the system better accommodates in the future is the number of ad hoc events, which is straining the money allocated to the ad hoc budget and making [SAC] meetings longer than expected,” Neidle said.
President of the College Democrats Joe Vandegriff (COL ’14) said that the new system has been beneficial in the adaptability it allows.
“It’s very hard to transition executive boards between semesters, and ad hoc provides flexibility for events that come up,” he said.
The College Democrats have used the ad hoc system for funding multiple events, including open houses and a club dinner at Ben’s Chili Bowl.
“[The new system] definitely makes you better as a club leader at planning events,” Vandegriff said. “In the end, it will be a good thing that clubs will use funds honestly and reduce waste.”

Georgetown’s endowment reached a record-high $1.162 billion for the 2011 fiscal year but fell two places from 61 to 63 in the National Association of College and University Business Officers-Commonfund Study’s rankings.
The university’s endowment grew 15.4 percent to reach the new high, up from a growth rate of 12.8 percent during the 2010 fiscal year, but still below the national average of 19 percent annual growth reported in the study.
Chief Investment Officer Michael Barry attributed the university’s drop in the rankings to the defensive positioning of the endowment portfolio, the impact of gifts received by peer institutions and Georgetown’s higher-than-average spending rate in the last fiscal year.
Barry added that the relatively small endowment represents a major competitive disadvantage for the university.
“The challenge of being just over $1 billion in size, from an operational standpoint, is that Georgetown must remain competitive with its peer institutions while relying on a smaller pool of supporting capital,” he said.
The continued growth of the endowment is primarily the result of returns to university investments in public equity markets, which came in at a rate of 16.8 percent.
Georgetown’s investments, comprised of unrestricted gifts, are managed by the university’s investment office. The total endowment also includes assets intended for a specific purpose.
Over the course of last year, $66.5 million of the endowment’s pooled funds were distributed.
“The purpose of the distribution policy is to strike a balance between current spending and endowment growth,” according to the university’s 2010-2011 Financial Statement.
The spending of endowment funds was balanced by contributions totaling $59.5 million. Overall, the university received $207 million in contributions and $132.7 million in future commitments last year.
The university’s 10-year-long campaign to raise $1.5 billion launched publicly after the end of the 2011 fiscal year and therefore did not have a substantive impact on the most recent endowment rankings. However, because the campaign is soliciting both one-time and rolling gifts, it is intended to have a significant long-term effect.
“There’s not going to be an immediate effect that will ramp up the endowment,” Barry said of the campaign.
Although the investment office does not offer specific predictions regarding the endowment, Barry is optimistic about the future of the all-important number.
“We’re planning … continuing growth,” he said. “We’re off to an OK start.”
Correction: The article previously stated that the university’s endowment fell from position 63 to 67. It feel from position 61 to 63.
