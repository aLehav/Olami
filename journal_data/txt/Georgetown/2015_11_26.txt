A group of more than 20 juveniles stole $13,000 worth of items from the designer store Diesel on the 3000 block of M Street NW just before 6 p.m. Tuesday evening.
According to the Metropolitan Police Department, a large group ran into the store, grabbed several items off the racks and ran out. One store employee was pushed from behind but was not injured.
The stolen merchandise included four leather jackets valued around $800 and an additional $12,000 worth of items.
This incident comes just after retailers, residents and police in the Georgetown area ceased using the messaging app GroupMe to reduce shoplifting. The project, titled Operation GroupMe, was taken down after allegations of racial profiling arose this fall.
Merchants in the Georgetown area began using the app in February at the encouragement of the MPD and the Georgetown Business Improvement District. Although it was meant to reduce shoplifting, members of the group on the app allegedly used racially offensive language, and descriptions sent through the app were of black customers about 70 percent of the time, according to a review by Georgetown BID.
The MPD described the suspects only as juveniles. There were no other known robberies in the area that day.
This story will be updated as more information becomes available.
