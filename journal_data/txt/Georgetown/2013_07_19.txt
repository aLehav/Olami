Students will be prohibited from bringing cars to campus after a change to the Code of Student Conduct, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson announced Thursday.
The move to reduce street congestion was a provision of last summer’s 2010 Campus Plan agreement that the university promised to implement by fall 2013.
Though this provision has been known for one year, student leaders have criticized the lack of transparency and student involvement in its implementation.
“Honestly, there was not a lot of consultation because the elements of that plan were agreed upon by university leaders and neighborhood leaders,” Olson said, adding that elements of the decision were discussed in Georgetown Community Partnership working groups.
Georgetown University Student Association President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14), who sits on the GCP steering committee, said that he was not aware of any GCP discussions about student parking. He expressed confusion at how the university treated this step of the campus plan agreement in comparison to its solicitation of student input for designs of the Northeast Triangle dormitory.
“Obviously we knew this was in the campus plan, but based on how they treated the dorm and they treated a lot of other issues, I think there was an expectation that they would discuss with us, with students, the implications of this,” he said. “Right now we have a policy that has no logic behind it and also no transparency in implementation. It is very disappointing.”
Under the new regulations, students are forbidden from parking on campus or on public streets in West Georgetown, Burleith or Foxhill Village, unless they have a reserved parking space as part of an off-campus rental. Before this change, students could obtain a permit to park on public streets. Exceptions to the new rule will be made on a case-by-case basis, Olson said.
Disciplinary consequences for violations of the rule have not yet been determined, though Olson said the specifics would be discussed with students before a decision is made.
While most students do not bring cars to campus, neighbors have complained about overcrowding due to student parking on some streets.
Ben Manzione (SFS ’15), co-director of the Student Advocacy Office and member of the Disciplinary Review Committee, was concerned that the university set a dangerous precedent by unilaterally changing the code of conduct without going through the DRC as is standard procedure — a step Olson said he bypassed because the university was required to make this change regardless of DRC approval.
“Depriving students from being able to park in a neighborhood on a public street is sort of targeting students and sort of bringing students down to a lower level,” Manzione said. “The campus plan didn’t have much student input to begin with, so I think the Disciplinary Review Committee should have had a say in it.”
Students who have relied on their cars in the past are disappointed with the new regulations.
“I think Georgetown University neglects the students who have jobs off campus,” said Kelsey Warrick (COL ’14), who drives to work in McLean, Va..
Nadeen Hussain (NHS ’15), who occasionally brings her car to campus from her family’s home in northern Virginia, agreed that students deserve equal treatment.
“As long as they are obeying the D.C. laws, I don’t see any problem with having someone bring their cars,” Hussain said. “I don’t think that they should be prohibited [from parking in Georgetown].”
Olson stressed that the university is paying attention to students’ interests.
“I understand the concerns about the parking policy and its implementation,” Olson said. “I also want to emphasize that we are working actively and have worked actively with student leaders to seek student engagement in this process of implementing the campus plan agreement.”
Tisa, however, was less hopeful.
“If this is what the campus plan is going to be like for the next few years, that’s not good. It’s not a good sign,” he said.

Vice President Joe Biden described the benefits of increased U.S. engagement in Asia in an address at The George Washington University on Thursday afternoon.
Biden cited three American goals in the region during his speech, which was sponsored by the Center for American Progress: stronger alliances, a new defense strategy and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement. He said that the United States would focus on proliferation, human disasters, conflict between nations, the threat posed by North Korea and the risks of disrupting commerce.
“In the Asia-Pacific, we saw a region of remarkable promise, but also genuine uncertainty and political risk,” Biden said to an audience of 250 invited guests, including Indian Ambassador to the United States Nirupama Rao.
Biden specified the payoff of the Trans-Pacific Partnership as part of the pivot to Asia, suggesting that its benefits would bolster stability and increase prosperity in both Asia and Latin America.
“To spark new growth, there has to be fewer barriers at and behind our borders, protections for intellectual property to reward innovation, new commitments to make sure everyone plays by the same rules because that’s what attracts investment and jobs, as well as greater economic integration,” Biden said.
The vice president, who will travel to the subcontinent and Singapore next week, pointed to the growth of India while outlining policy implications for specific countries in the region.
“Twenty, even 10 years ago, some might have suggested that India be left out of discussions about the Asia-Pacific,” Biden said. “[Today] India is increasingly looking east as a force for security and growth in Southeast Asia and beyond.”
Biden also spoke to the health of the U.S.-China relationship.
“We do not view our relationship and future relations with China in terms of conflict or the talk of inevitable conflict,” Biden said. “We view it in terms of a healthy mix of competition and cooperation. A competition that we welcome; it’s stamped into our DNA.”
The vice president addressed fears in some European capitals that the pivot to Asia will mean fewer resources for U.S. efforts in the Middle East.
“Europe, just like us, will benefit greatly as well from stability in the Pacific, in Asia. And by the way, there is no reason why we cannot bring greater focus to the Asia-Pacific and keep our eye on the ball in the Middle East,” Biden said. “Folks, that’s what big powers do. To use the vernacular, we can walk and chew gum at the same time.”
Georgetown associate professor of international relations Michael Green, who also serves as vice president for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Biden was trying to reaffirm that American interest in Asia remains high, despite turnover at the State Department.
“There are real questions out in Asia about who will champion Asia policy and the pivot after Hillary Clinton and Kurt Campbell,” Green wrote in an email. “Beijing is telling the smaller ASEAN states that America comes and goes, but China will always be there, so they had better rethink who their real friends are.  In that context, Biden’s attention to the region is welcome, but is it enough?”
Biden concluded his speech with a defense of economic and political freedom — and a plug for the administration’s economic policy.
“We’re better positioned than any time before to be able to do it all. I know you’ll think it sounds like a campaign assertion I’ve been making for years, but America is back,” Biden said. “I think it’s because of the enduring strength of our people and of our system. For all our difficulty in education for our children, they’re still taught to challenge orthodoxy.”
