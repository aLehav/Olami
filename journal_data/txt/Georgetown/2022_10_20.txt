A cancer epidemiology and control researcher discussed new findings on treating cancer survivors at a talk hosted by the Georgetown University Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center.
The Oct. 14 event, entitled “Predicting and Preventing Adverse Outcomes in Cancer Survivors,” was part of the Lombardi Center’s ongoing Survivorship Research Initiative seminar series. The center’s goal is to improve the treatment of cancer patients both during and after recovery in a more equitable way. Dr. Smita Bhatia, a professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and director of the UAB Heersink School of Medicine Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, an organization that conducts research to support cancer survivors, presented at the event in hopes of drawing attention to complications of cancer treatment that are often overlooked.
Bhatia’s presentation focused on childhood cancer survivors, a demographic she said is especially vulnerable to the harmful effects of drugs and other preventative measures that patients undergo.
“Childhood cancer survivors are at a sixfold higher risk of dying,” Bhatia said at the presentation. “And their life is shortened by one to two decades, so this is quite a sobering thing.”
Bhatia spoke about the model she created to predict likely adverse outcomes in childhood cancer survivors, sharing the factors that contribute to those outcomes most often — genetic predisposition, lifestyle exposures and viral infections. 
Bhatia said these factors can inform researchers and healthcare providers on how to proactively identify cancer survivors who are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of treatment.
“All of these can help us in identifying those who are at the highest risk of developing these complications,” Bhatia said. “And we can use this information to modify therapeutic exposures, screen patients who are at the highest risk or institute some risk reduction strategies.”
For children with cancer, radiation therapy creates a higher risk of developing brain tumors and breast cancer in the future, according to Bhatia. As a result, she conducted research on tamoxifen, an FDA-approved option for mitigating the risk of breast cancer, and found that it can be effective at doing so.
In her presentation, Bhatia discussed four chronic health conditions that therapeutic exposure to radiation during treatment may cause: bone degradation, congestive heart failure, tumor regrowth and stroke. Her research examines the specific genes that increase the risk of these outcomes, especially the risk of cardiomyopathy, or a weakening of heart muscle, in response to a type of cancer treatment drug called anthracyclines. 
Despite these complications, Bhatia said cancer research is progressing in the right direction.
“The question is, ‘Are we there yet?’ Well, not yet,” Bhatia said. “But I think we’re solidly on the path to where we need to be.”
Dr. Nina Kadan-Lottick, director of the Survivorship Research Initiative at the Lombardi Center, said the seminar series gives Georgetown community members the opportunity to hear firsthand about national leaders’ new research in the cancer survivorship field.
“These seminars energize and inspire our Georgetown faculty and trainees,” Kadan-Lottick wrote to The Hoya. “They lead to further innovative ideas and multidisciplinary collaboration on both clinical and research initiatives.”
Kadan-Lottick said the work Bhatia and the initiative are doing helps support survivors throughout their cancer journey.
“Survivorship encompasses the patient’s experience of the physical, emotional, and social impact of being treated for cancer and the late effects that can persist or newly develop after therapy ends,” Kadan-Lottick wrote. “It is about quality of life, not just the quantity of life.”

The first female deputy speaker of parliament in Afghanistan discussed women’s rights in Afghanistan at a roundtable discussion hosted by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security (GIWPS). 
Fawzia Koofi held a conversation Oct. 11 with Georgetown University students about the security and human rights crisis in Afghanistan, as well as the threat to women’s rights. Koofi shared her experience of being one of only four women involved in the Doha peace negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban in 2020. The roundtable was held in celebration of International Day of the Girl Child, an United Nations-declared international observance day held annually Oct. 11. The day brings attention to girls experiencing underprivileged circumstances and the girls’ right to equality, especially educational equality.
Koofi said the risk the Taliban poses to women’s rights in Afghanistan is not just a national problem, but a matter of global security.
“If Afghan women are continued to be pushed in the corner as they are now, abandoned and not a priority for the International community, we are going to face the major consequences,” Koofi wrote to The Hoya. “As a result of this we must see this as a matter of national security. That is why we must ensure to give the required space and recognize women agency.”
Koofi represented Afghanistan at the 2020 peace talks in Doha; she was one of just four women present at the negotiations. Since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in August 2021, they have stripped Afghan women of their rights, freedom and roles in public life. No women hold cabinet positions under the regime, and the group also abolished the Ministry of Women’s Affairs. Women can no longer attend school past the sixth grade, nor can they work outside the home. They face severe — and often violent — consequences if they are found violating these rules. 
Lucile Malone (GRD ’24), a masters student who is studying global affairs in the Middle East and North Africa, said it is essential for students like her to continue to educate themselves about the treatment of women in Afghanistan.
“As a Muslim woman, the Afghan Women’s cause is one dear to my heart,” Malone wrote to The Hoya. “As a woman with access to education and work, it is important that I use my privileges to uplift women around the world.”
Malone said Koofi’s words served as an important reminder of the impact of determination in seeking equal rights for girls and women in Afghanistan.
“Ms. Koofi was a clear example of determination,” Malone wrote. “She recognized the challenges but urged us to not lose hope. I walked away feeling a stronger sense of responsibility to act but also more hopeful.”
Koofi, who fled Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover last year, said Afghan women have been fighting for their rights for over 20 years, and will continue to do so by failing to cower to demands from the Taliban.
Melanne Verveer, the executive director of GIWPS, formerly served as the U.S. ambassador-at-large for global women’s issues. Verveer said that the voices of Afghan women are critical to fighting for a better future in Afghanistan.
“Afghan women in their country and in exile are critical to the future of Afghanistan, and Fawzia has been a leader in keeping the issue of women’s rights in Afghanistan front and center,” Verveer wrote to The Hoya.
Malone said that roundtable discussions, such as the one GIWPS held with Koofi, provide Georgetown students with experience, which bolsters their knowledge about global issues and helps them understand which policies will contribute to meaningful action.
“As future policymakers, engagement and education on the issue from the Afghan perspective is key,” Malone wrote. “Conversations with Afghan leaders like Ms. Koofi will allow us to push forth well-rounded policies that are empathetic and reasonable.”
Malone says Koofi’s call to action on International Day of the Girl Child empowered her to continue her advocacy for women’s rights in Afghanistan.
“It was one that resonated with all of us,” Malone wrote. “We must keep the Afghan women in our thoughts and actively work to improve their lives.”

The Financial Markets Quality (FMQ) conference, hosted by Georgetown University’s Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, highlighted leaders in global finance and their perspectives on the latest developments in the financial field.
The annual FMQ conference addresses urgent current financial issues –– including fintech, digital assets and capital raising –– and advises attendees on best practices for the coming year. At the Oct. 14 conference, the 14th in its history, speakers included Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Gary Gensler and CEO of the London Stock Exchange Group David Schwimmer, among others. Panelists sought to explore five key topics: market structure, environmental responsibilities, digital assets, cryptocurrencies and financial policy.
The event sought to bring together policymakers, business executives and scholars to find interdisciplinary solutions to these ongoing issues, according to Reena Aggarwal, the founding director of the Psaros Center and a finance professor within the McDonough School of Business (MSB).
“Recent events have raised a number of questions about the quality of financial markets and the right approach to financial regulation in a rapidly changing world,” Aggarwal wrote to The Hoya. “Part of our mission at the Psaros Center is to convene consequential conversations that promote smart solutions to complex problems.”
This year marked the first in-person FMQ conference since the COVID-19 pandemic, with around 400 people joining the event, both from the university and the Washington, D.C. community. Attendees had the opportunity to ask the speakers questions, according to Aggarwal.
The conference involved a series of discussions that each focused on a different area of financial market activities. Aggarwal said a highlight of the day was the discussion of new issues for which policymakers are still developing legislation, such as the panel on market structure, which covered changes in trends regarding individual investors.
“For example, crypto regulation was not on the radar until recently; it was during COVID that participation by retail investors increased significantly raising renewed interest in market structure and conflicts of interest,” Aggarwal wrote. “These are all issues that policymakers are working on and therefore we addressed them at FMQ this year.”
The conference’s final session was a pre-recorded discussion about crypto legislation with Lummis and Gillibrand, who introduced the Responsible Financial Innovations Act earlier this year, which creates a framework for regulating new financial technologies, according to Gillibrand.
“Digital assets, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies have experienced tremendous growth in the past few years and offer substantial potential benefits if harnessed correctly,” Gillibrand wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “It is critical that the United States plays a leading role in developing policy to regulate new financial products, while also encouraging innovation and protecting consumers.”
Multiple panels covered the topic of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing and disclosure, according to Aggarwal. ESG investing emphasizes environmental responsibility, transparency and diversity, equity and inclusion efforts within financial corporations.
Several speakers gave “fireside chats,” in which they discussed distinct financial topics, one-on-one with a moderator. These speakers included Gensler, Schwimmer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chair Rostin Behnam, Schwimmer and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) President and CEO Robert Cook.
A roundtable featuring CFTC Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero and SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda (GSB ’92) focused on financial market regulation and policy. The CFTC and SEC are both U.S. government agencies that regulate various aspects of financial markets.
The bill seeks to clarify newer features of finance including the digital asset market and provide guidelines, according to Abegail Cave, press secretary for Lummis.
“Today, the global market cap for digital assets is $929 billion. This is a massive industry that lacks clear guidelines for innovators and protections for consumers,” Cave wrote to The Hoya. “Digital assets are not going away, so it is time to fully integrate them into our existing financial structure.”
Aggarwal said she believes the FMQ conference helps to facilitate conversations and generate new ideas, especially around aspects of financial markets that are currently advancing, and that her personal highlight of the day was the discussion of new issues for which legislation is still being developed.
“Many of the issues we discussed are relatively new and policymakers are trying to figure out how best to approach regulation,” Aggarwal wrote. “For example, crypto regulation was not on the radar until recently; it was during COVID that participation by retail investors increased significantly raising renewed interest in market structure and conflicts of interest; requirements for climate disclosure is also a relatively new issue.”

Georgetown College and the McDonough School of Business (MSB) launched a new joint Bachelor of Science in International Business, Language and Culture (IBLC). 
The joint degree program, which was formally approved in April, was announced Oct. 11 and is now available to students. The IBLC program focuses on the intersection between business and culture, borrowing coursework from both the MSB’s program in international business and the College’s faculty of language and linguistics. 
Students can apply to the joint degree program at the end of their first year at Georgetown, beginning with the class of 2026 and beyond. Students from both the MSB and College are eligible to attain the degree, which is managed by a collaborative committee with members from both schools. 
The program is comprised of a total of around 120 credits, with 30 to 36 credits in the modified international business curriculum and 24 to 40 credits in the language and culture curriculum. Given the rigorous requirements, students will not be allowed to pursue a second major in another field. The degree also includes 30 to 36 credits of integrated core classes as well as a culminating capstone course.
According to Tad Howard, Georgetown College chief of staff and associate dean, the program was inspired by the desire to explore the crossover between business and language. 
“Our thinking started with the longstanding collaborations between the College’s language departments and the MSB, which provided language majors opportunities to complete formal business programs,” Howard wrote to The Hoya. “We wanted to build on that history to create something even more integrated and immersive.”
Donatella Melucci, who will serve as faculty co-director of the IBLC joint degree program on the College side, said the program will importantly allow business students to become confident in their foreign language skills and be able to conduct businesses across the globe.
“We are trying to provide the kind of integrative education in language and business so students learning the language and being familiar with the customs of each country, and therefore, the culture, would be more competent,” Melucci said to The Hoya.
According to John Cui, who will serve as faculty co-director of the program on the MSB side, the program represents a joint effort on behalf of the College and the MSB to provide Georgetown students with opportunities that reflect the university’s educational mission.
“Both schools have put a lot of thought and a lot of effort into developing this program,” Cui told The Hoya. “Georgetown students are awesome, and we want to diversify the opportunities that we have for them.” 
The newly launched IBLC program reflects Georgetown’s continued emphasis on interdisciplinary learning, becoming the school’s second business-focused joint degree program, following the creation of the Bachelor of Science in Business and Global Affairs (BSBGA) joint degree program with the School of Foreign Service (SFS) in 2019, which was created to meet the desire for programs that bridge the gap between schools at Georgetown.
IBLC differentiates itself from the MSB’s business programs because of its emphasis on language and culture, Howard said. 
“That emphasis is not just about the number of language courses, but the way those courses and the Core curriculum itself are interwoven with the business curriculum,” Howard said. “The result, we expect, is a rigorous and rewarding degree that emphasizes the humanistic and cultural dimensions of business decisions, and the importance of linguistic competency in the business sector overall.”
The program will allow the university to empower students to take their skills in language and business into the world, Cui said. 
“We want to invest in students,” Cui said. “We want them to be able to learn these concepts in the intersection of business language and culture but also be able to practice these concepts and to help create a better world.”

Georgetown University’s journalism program is celebrating its 10-year anniversary under the leadership of a new director dedicated to experiential learning. 
Rebecca Sinderbrand (COL ’99), who became director of the program this fall, will lead the program into its second decade with a relaunch of its website, an annual journalism conference, a new alumni advisory panel and new academic courses. Sinderbrand took leadership of the program after years of work in the journalism field, most recently as senior Washington editor for NBC News.
Prior to her role at NBC, Sinderbrand held editorial positions at The Washington Post, Politico and CNN. Sinderbrand previously served as a fellow for the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service in the Fall 2016 semester. While at Georgetown, Sinderbrand served as deputy news editor for The Hoya, working alongside other Hoya staff including current New York Times reporter Clay Risen and ABC News correspondent Karen Travers.
As Sinderbrand implements new additions to the journalism program this year, she said her overarching goal will be to ensure that any student who wishes to pursue a career in journalism has the resources to do so.
“In every decision that this program makes, that will remain the core priority: making sure that students never feel as though there are barriers that their talent and their interest and their motivation can’t overcome with our assistance,” Sinderbrand told The Hoya.
Sinderbrand said her short-term goals for the program include hosting on-campus events with successful journalists with whom she has connections from her time in the industry, strengthening career-based programming and hiring new adjunct professors who have worked for major news outlets.
Sinderbrand said she missed these opportunities during her time as a Georgetown undergraduate when there was no journalism program.
“We have a really just amazing opportunity to provide our students with a set of experiences and the type of connections that they really wouldn’t necessarily be able to get anywhere else,” Sinderbrand said. “And that for me is a priority, particularly again as someone who came to Georgetown and did not know a single person in journalism and couldn’t even conceive of it as a profession.”
Sinderbrand said developing experiential learning, which she defines as opportunities both inside and outside the classroom, will drive her decision-making process as she leads the program. She hopes to bring students to newsrooms, the White House press room and Capitol Hill to help students form connections with top journalists.
“We want to raise awareness of that, but also create this community where we have alumni who are kind of reaching back to the next generation of Georgetown journalists and helping to launch them and giving them their start and showing them the ropes,” Sinderbrand said. 
Sinderbrand said the program will be relaunching its website this spring as part of its 10-year anniversary celebration, with the updated website featuring new digital content like interviews with alumni and Barbara Todd, the founder of Georgetown’s journalism program. Todd served as director of the journalism program until 2017, after which Georgetown named Los Angeles Times reporter Doyle McManus as director. 
Sinderbrand has brought her many connections from the journalism world to the Hilltop, according to professor Ann Oldenburg, who serves as assistant director of the journalism program.
Oldenburg said Sinderbrand has already helped the program organize events with Mark Leibovich from The Atlantic, news radio host Ira Glass from “This American Life” and Capitol Hill reporter Ali Vitali from NBC News.
“It’s really exciting,” Oldenburg told The Hoya. “Rebecca is bringing so much energy and so many great ideas and so many connections, so many plans. She really sees a great future for the program, and that’s exactly what the program has needed.”
Quentin Fidance (SFS ’24), who is pursuing a minor in journalism, said the journalism program provides students with opportunities to explore their interests in politics and economics through a different lens.
 “When you think of Georgetown, you think of those future politicians and world leaders. Those high rising executives and social leaders,” Fidance wrote to The Hoya. “But there is an untapped potential for covering the news. Students hold politics, social affairs, and the economy with such high regard, and the journalism minor provides a new opportunity to express those views outside of working on Capitol Hill or a consulting firm.”
Oldenburg said the journalism program aims to expand in size, and she expects that the speakers Sinderbrand brings to campus will encourage more students to explore the field of journalism. 
“I think Rebecca’s plans will perhaps excite people to want to go into journalism more, because we will have a lot of people here talking about how important it is and people who’ve done great work and are doing great work,” Oldenburg said.

Washington, D.C. officials filed a lawsuit against chemical manufacturer Velsicol for the illegal sale and distribution of chlordane, a harmful pesticide that has been banned by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) since 1988. 
The lawsuit, led by D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine, alleges that Velsicol violated the District’s Brownfield Revitalization Act, which regulates the cleanup of contaminated sites, and common law for public nuisance and product liability by continuing to sell chlordane products for decades. This came despite the company knowing for nearly 60 years that the pesticide can cause cancer and other serious health issues. Since then, Velsicol has continued to run misinformation campaigns, including marketing chlordane for household use, to deceive the public and continue profiting from chlorodane’s sale.
Racine said the lawsuit seeks to reconcile harm that D.C. residents faced as a result of Velsicol’s distribution of chlordane.
“Our office prioritizes enforcing D.C.’s environmental laws to combat the climate crisis, fight for environmental justice, and ensure that every District resident has access to clean air and water,” Racine said in a press release. “With today’s lawsuit, we are going after Velsicol which –– for decades –– made dollar after dollar of profit while poisoning D.C. residents with dangerous chemicals that they knew caused severe health problems, including cancer.” 
Velsicol did not reply to a request for comment from The Hoya in time for publication.
Chlordane is a pollutant that can remain in organic material for decades after its use, according to Jesse Meiller, an environmental toxicologist and associate teaching professor at Georgetown University.
“Chlordane has been shown to bioaccumulate in organisms and be transferred up the food chain through biomagnification,” Meiller wrote to The Hoya. “This bioaccumulation is an issue for people that are eating the fish from waterways where chlordane still persists. It has also been found in the air of homes that were treated for termites using chlordane 20 years ago.”
Chlordane can also cause serious health issues, including cancer, according to Meiller.
“Chlordane is classified as a probable human carcinogen,” Meiller wrote. “This is based on studies done in rats and mice which developed cancers in the liver following exposures. Chlordane also has other non-cancer adverse effects as well. It has been shown to be a reproductive toxicant, an endocrine disruptor, and to cause adverse effects in the liver.”
The harmful impact of chlordane usage is likely magnified among vulnerable communities, especially those with less reliable access to healthcare resources such as the District’s Black and brown communities, Racine said.
“The environment is a precious resource that belongs to everyone, and far too often Black and Brown communities of color are forced to bear the brunt of pollution, toxic sites and contaminated water supplies,” Racine said. 
According to a report published by the Georgetown University School of Nursing & Health Studies (NHS) in 2020, Black residents in Washington, D.C., on average live shorter, less healthy lives than white residents because of systemic disparities in health care, education and wealth.
Chlordane does not easily dissolve in water, and therefore can build up in D.C. waterways, including the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers, harming District residents who drink water contaminated by the chemical.
According to Amber Mickelson (COL ’25), who serves as academic chair of the Georgetown Undergraduate Environmental Health Collaborative (GUEHC), she worries that the flow of these rivers into higher-risk neighborhoods in the District could have dangerous public health impacts.
“This means that any chemicals flowing downstream through those rivers are going to be disproportionately settling in the soil of Wards 7 and 8, where the population of those wards are on average 96.22% people of color and are at higher risk of living in poverty,” Mickelson wrote to the Hoya.
Mickelson said she remains hopeful that the lawsuit is a step toward greater accountability for those polluting D.C. ecosystems and waterways.
“Our environment shapes our health, and when that environment has been ruined by companies seeking profit over people, we need to see accountability,” Mickelson wrote. “Ultimately, lawsuits like these are needed to bring justice to the generations of the past, present, and future.”

CW: This article discusses domestic and sexual violence. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
Washington, D.C., hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony in advance of the opening of a new domestic violence shelter that will provide support for survivors of domestic violence, offering counseling, individual case management and resources for finding supportive services. 
The shelter is still under construction, but District officials cut a ribbon on the shelter Oct. 13 in observance of Domestic Violence Awareness Month. The shelter is a collaborative effort of the office of D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D), the D.C. Office of Victim Services and Justice Grants (OVSJG) and My Sister’s Place (MSP), a District-based nonprofit that provides housing and leadership tools to domestic violence survivors and their children. MSP was able to work on this project with the help of a $4.5 million grant from OVSJG, aiming to serve as a model on how to provide low-barrier services for domestic violence survivors. 
The shelter contains six apartment units, some of which can accommodate large families and will assist domestic violence survivors by serving as a launching pad into transitional housing, allowing families to spend between three and six months at the shelter before moving, according to the press release.  
Toshira Monroe, deputy director of MSP, said the shelter will support District residents who are survivors of domestic abuse. 
“The new shelter means that we have the support of the Mayor and city to address the rampant domestic violence in the District,” Monroe wrote to The Hoya. “Everyone has a potential to be at risk for domestic violence, but some populations are more at risk and have less access to resources. And that’s why we do that work we do.”
Around 4,000 women die each year from domestic violence, and women between the ages of 18 to 34 and women of color tend to be affected at higher rates. 
In the United States, 35.6% of women and 28.5% of men will experience intimate partner physical violence, sexual violence, or stalking in their lifetimes. In D.C., rates are higher for women, with 39% of women and 25.5% of men in D.C. experiencing these forms of abuse. 
Monroe said this project and Domestic Violence Awareness Month will shed light on the importance of building healthy relationships and a community of loved ones to fight the threat of domestic violence.
“I hope that people take from this month the importance of communication and healthy relationship building,” Monroe wrote. “Additionally, for those who haven’t and have, that it’s important to build a community of support and resources that everyone can access.”
During the 2021-23 fiscal years, the Bowser administration invested $36 million into 709 units of housing and accompanying wraparound services and collaborations between local government and nonprofit organizations, including MSP. These figures represent a 47% increase in funding for domestic violence housing and services since the 2019 fiscal year.
Arika Adams, executive director of CASA For Children, an organization working on advocacy and mentorship development for foster and court-involved children in the District, said many of the children and families CASA works with are affected by domestic violence. 
“All of the children and families we work with are impacted by trauma,” Adams wrote to The Hoya. “Many times that trauma involves Domestic Violence. Regardless, the trauma is long-lasting. However it’s not hopeless. With the help of a CASA volunteer, children and family are able to receive therapeutic support and advocacy along with many other tangible supports and connections to empower them to move forward.”
Domestic Violence Awareness Month aims to raise awareness about the complexity of domestic violence and bring empathy and attention to those who are affected by it, Adams said.
“I hope that folks who have not been affected by domestic violence are able to learn how complicated the issues at play are. They are deep and it’s never a simple ‘just leave’ answer,” Adams wrote. “I hope folks who have been affected by domestic violence feel seen, heard and supported. They are not alone and there are resources available for support.” 
Local organizations like My Sister’s Place and House of Ruth, a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing support to survivors of domestic abuse and their families, are resources that offer shelter, counseling and hotline services. The District has a number of available hotlines for survivors to call and seek assistance.
Lisa Streeter, who serves as outreach coordinator of the Progressive Life Center, a District-based social welfare center that provides mental health services to individuals and families in the sphere of foster care, said she believes resources like these shelters are critical in domestic violence prevention and intervention.
“My Sister’s Place accommodates individuals/families and offers counseling, individual case management and referrals to other supportive services and resources,” Streeter wrote to The Hoya. “Nationally, emergency shelter and transitional housing continues to be the greatest unmet need for domestic violence survivors. Domestic violence shelters provide victims with a safe haven and immediate protection from danger.”
While trauma often shrouds families and children affected by domestic violence, support systems and resources like the new domestic violence shelter offer hope for disrupting these cycles, Adams said.
“It is another positive step in supporting survivors,” Adams wrote. “I’m grateful for any and all movement towards providing options and opportunities available.”
This article was updated on Oct. 21 to reflect that the ribbon-cutting ceremony did not mark the official opening of the shelter.

Three of the United States’ most influential art museums, including Washington, D.C.’s Smithsonian National Museum of African Art and the National Gallery of Art, repatriated dozens of looted artifacts to Nigeria.
The 31 pieces the Smithsonian is returning are part of a group of thousands of sculptures that make up the “Benin Bronzes,” intricate metal plaques and sculptures which once resided in the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin in Nigeria and served as emblems of the dynasty’s rich history and religious traditions. The transfer of ownership follows the creation of the Smithsonian’s ethical returns policy in April 2022, which authorizes Smithsonian museums to return collections that were stolen, taken under duress or otherwise unethically acquired to the appropriate community.
Ian Bourland, an associate professor of art history at Georgetown University, said the return of the bronzes is a victory for a long-standing movement of Western nations taking accountability for colonialist activity. 
“After the Congress of Berlin, colonial powers moving into the African interior really intensified colonial exploitation of those countries,” Bourland told The Hoya. “A lot of pre-colonial African art was taken, and that has resided in global northern museums, for many cases, over 100 years or so. The debate around the provenance of that work, the ownership of that work, its conservation, its utility, its meaning has been ongoing.”
Initially stolen by British troops in a late 19th century raid on Benin City, Nigeria, many Western nations took possession of the artifacts and have since featured them in collections of African art at various museums including the British Museum in London and the Royal African Museum in Belgium.
Meredith McKittrick, an associate professor in Georgetown’s African studies program, said the transfer of ownership reflects a shift in the way people consider the effects of imperialism. 
“I think it reflects an openness to reconsidering what we thought was the way things had to be,” McKittrick told The Hoya. “The idea that there’s been a change of mentality among some people in North America and in Europe is heartening, certainly.”
The Smithsonian National Museum of African Art commemorated the bronzes’ return to Nigeria at a press conference in the museum, where representatives from the museum and the National Gallery of Art officially transferred ownership of the bronzes to Nigeria’s National Commission for Museums and Monuments in the presence of members of the Kingdom of Benin royal family and Nigerian cultural officials.
Georgetown art and museum studies professor Lisa Strong said the process of returning stolen artifacts is widely established and straightforward.
“There’s a period where you take an inventory, you make public what you have, you allow groups who would make a claim on objects to come and see them, and then they petition and you approve it, and then you return objects,” Strong told The Hoya. “It becomes a very kind of clear, rational process, and I think that that has been helpful in getting museums to feel more comfortable.”
Returning stolen artifacts like the bronzes is a relatively easy, non-resource intensive way to address the effects of colonialism, according to McKittrick.
“It does reflect a change of thinking and mentality, which is important, but it doesn’t require a great deal of sacrifice by people in the global north to make it right in the way that economic reparations for colonialism would require,” McKittrick said.
Strong said despite losing part of their collections, museums benefit from returning stolen artifacts because it builds trust with patrons.
“If they are holding things that they shouldn’t have, then they can’t earn the trust of the public,” Strong said. “So it’s much more important for museums to do the right thing, even if it means that they don’t have those masterpieces of Benin art anymore.”
Several other Benin bronzes will still be on loan at the National Museum of African Art, but Bourland said people who want to see the bronzes should visit Nigeria to see the pieces in their original context. 
“That kind of tourism usually benefits the economies and communities in these home countries,” Bourland said. “It’s very important that these works are reported because there’s an economic aspect of this as well.”
While the return of the bronzes is a step in the right direction, McKittrick said the movement to repatriate stolen artifacts is far from over.  
“It’s great that this is finally happening — it’s definitely overdue,” McKittrick said. “I’ll feel like we’ve gotten somewhere when, for example, the British Museum hands back the Rosetta Stone. To me that is the sign — that’s the symbol.”

CONTENT WARNING: This article briefly mentions sexual assault and gender-based violence. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
Modern emergency notification technologies, such as 911 help lines, fail to equally serve all populations and negatively harm marginalized communities, a graduate said at an event hosted by the Georgetown Disability Studies Program. 
The Oct. 17 talk entitled “Call If You Can,” was hosted by the Disability Studies program alongside the Georgetown Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship, a university center that helps faculty craft transformational learning experiences for students, and the Film and Media Studies program. The event centered Elizabeth Ellcessor’s (SFS ’04) book “In Case of Emergency: How Technologies Mediate Crisis and Normalize Inequality,” which focuses on the interaction between emergency media technology and inequalities.
At the event, Ellcessor, an associate professor of media studies at the University of Virginia and senior faculty fellow at UVA’s Miller Center, spoke about disparities caused by many emergency prevention systems, including Life Alert, 911 response services, governmental emergency warnings and COVID-19 tracking apps. 
According to Ellcessor, existing emergency response institutions fail to serve all populations equitably and often endanger the lives of vulnerable groups, such as the experiences of people of color with law enforcement. 
Ellcessor opened with the story of Judy McKim, a mother who was forced to cover her garage with notices to local law enforcement that her son was autistic after he was assaulted by police responding to a 911 call in 2016. 
“McKim’s garage is but one example of how Black families have attempted to protect their disabled children,” Elcessor said at the event. “Smaller protective acts include parents who ask neighbors to never call 911, or who preemptively install security systems to record any encounters with authorities. While all kinds of people may face crises, these actions demonstrate that the systems of emergency identification and response — including media systems such as 911 — are not equally available or reliable.”
Blue light emergency alarm stations, which are typically found on college campus so students can call for help in emergencies, reinforce existing stereotypes about instances of sexual assaults on college campuses, according to Ellecssor. In reality, blue light systems typically are unused and primarily function for universities to advertise a superficial sense of security.
“These physical media infrastructures reflect several assumptions about the nature of crime, in general, and sexual assault, specifically — that it occurs in public, is committed by strangers — and the desired response: contacting campus authorities,” Ellcessor said. “The phones were installed as a response; they were never a solution.”
Ellcessor said 911 help centers can also create barriers in emergencies because callers of certain backgrounds are not always trusted by operators when seeking help. 
“Multiple studies indicate that this is more easily done when a caller can present themself in alignment with the expectations of the reporting system ideologically, linguistically and culturally,” Ellcessor said. “Those who cannot do so — people of color, disabled people and non-English speakers — are particularly likely to find that reporting a situation to police or authorities may worsen circumstances rather than improve them.” 
Ellcessor said that despite these flaws, there is still hope for the future of emergency services because disability justice movements can serve as exemplars of effective problem solving not founded on a return to an unrepresentative concept of normalcy. 
“Disability justice is an intersectional framework for collective, anti-capitalist access and liberation,” Ellcessor said.“Disability justice activists and theorists have long worked to build models of centering sustainability, slowness and building for the long haul, rather than succumbing to logics of cure or restoration that seek to restore normalcy.”
Change is only possible by remaining vigilant and critical of the inequalities created by emergency response systems, according to Ellcessor.
“We must pay attention when such systems are installed, activated or changed, and ask tough questions about what technologies we employ, accept and deputize in pursuit of safety for ourselves, our loved ones and our communities,” Ellcessor said. “What emergency media is now is not what it must always be.”

Following months of closure for extensive renovations, the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum reopened its doors to visitors, with a completely refurbished wing adding several new interactive exhibits. 
The museum reopened Oct. 14 after being closed to the public since April 2022 as part of a project that originally began as an HVAC refurbishment. The renovations soon became a seven-year overhaul of the popular museum as the Smithsonian utilized the opportunity to structurally improve the building as well as offer a more modern, immersive experience for visitors. 
The renovation included upgrades to the planetarium, increased exhibition space and more interactive galleries. The project completes phase one of the museum’s renovation project, culminating in the reopening of the west wing, which houses eight exhibits as well as a café. The east wing, which houses an additional 15 exhibits, will remain closed for similar upgrades that are expected to be completed by 2025. The entire renovation project began in 2018. 
Christopher Browne, who serves as John and Adrienne Mars Director of the museum, said the renovation aims to provide a more immersive experience to visitors. 
“There’s a lot of new storytelling going on, some of it relating to past events but some of it is more current, with a fresher, more contemporary look than what previous visitors would have expected from their prior visits,” Browne said in an interview with The Hoya. “But importantly, we’re able to tell many new stories to a diverse and contemporary audience in ways that we were unable to previously.”
According to Browne, some of the most significant renovations have been to the planetarium, which is now able to connect to other planetariums around the country using screencasts so that people can have a similar immersive experience without having to travel to Washington, D.C. As a result of the renovations, the museum is expecting an increase in visitors and is currently requiring attendees to sign up for free timed tickets. 
Museum leadership is experimenting with the number of timed passes available in order to maximize the number of visitors and maintain a quality experience, according to Alison Mitchell, deputy director of communications at the Air and Space Museum.
“We do anticipate the museum will be very popular for quite some time,” Mitchell wrote to The Hoya. “The National Air and Space Museum was one of the most visited museums in the country prior to the renovation and we anticipate that popularity will not only continue but increase as a result of the renovation.”
The first phase of the project did not go without complications, as the COVID-19 pandemic presented a number of problems for the renovation crew, according to Browne.
“We had issues with supply chains and escalation of costs, and so COVID impacted both the schedule and the budget of the program,” Browne said. “I would say that was the major unexpected influence that did set us back a bit.”
According to Browne, the second half of the renovation will add 15 more galleries, reaching a total of 23 once the project is complete. In addition to the new galleries and exhibition space, the east wing will have a full restaurant, IMAX theater, and will house the Bezos Learning Center, a $130 million project funded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who donated a record-setting $200 million to the museum in 2021. 
The addition will feature 50,000 square feet of space intended to inspire younger generations to innovate. The Smithsonian said that it will not just focus on aerospace, but will connect to all of the museums in its system. Four firms have submitted design proposals for the center.
Browne said the new galleries will offer more interactive experiences for museum guests. 
“So we’ve got a lot of work ahead of us,” Browne said. “The galleries that we’ve opened have a lot of immersives and digital content, over 50 interactives, and so it’s a different kind of experience than what folks would remember, and we will carry that on into the east end as well.”
Browne said the renovations will enable younger generations to see the relevance of aerospace history for years to come.
“When you put all of these things together, you can solve incredible things like going to the moon when nobody thought it possible,” Browne said. “And I believe that the relevancy of museums like ours is as or more important than ever, in a world that is increasingly skeptical and doubting.”

Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg discussed new transportation and infrastructure policy, climate change and environmental justice, among other issues in a town hall-style discussion with students and faculty in Gaston Hall. 
The Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service (GU Politics) and SiriusXM hosted the Oct. 11 event titled “A Town Hall with Secretary Pete Buttigieg.” GU Politics Executive Director Mo Elleithee and Julie Mason, the host of political news show “Julie Mason Mornings” on SiriusXM, moderated the discussion. 
The former South Bend, Ind. mayor and 2020 presidential candidate touted the bipartisan infrastructure law that President Joe Biden signed in 2021 and called it a once-in-a-generation investment in transportation, including roads and highways, public transit and passenger rail.
“Think about what it means for there to be a safer, cleaner, faster way to get to where you need to be, for people and for goods,” Buttigieg said at the event. “And that’s what we have a chance to deliver on right now.” 
The $1 trillion infrastructure law, while not fully addressing Biden’s original plan to overhaul the United States’ transportation system, still includes major investments to expand access to broadband internet, provide clean drinking water and fund new and affordable electric vehicles. The law also aims to rebuild deficient roads and bridges and improve worsening environmental pollution in hopes of stimulating the United States economy. 
While the U.S. Congress faces intense political gridlock on the majority of policy issues, transportation and infrastructure often serve as areas of agreement for the two parties, even when lawmakers don’t express full public support for the law, according to Buttigieg. 
“It’s worth mentioning that quite a few Republicans crossed over in the Senate and a handful did in the House in order to work with Democrats and work with the president to get this done,” Buttigieg said. “And what I’ve noticed is whether someone voted for it or against it, they are perfectly happy to support the individual projects we’re funding with it, so that’s how you know it’s good policy.” 
Buttigieg also spoke on the role climate change plays in the future of transportation policy, saying transportation policy and climate change are inextricably linked.
According to Buttigieg, the transportation sector is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gasses in the U.S. and climate-related events including flooding, droughts and heat waves damage transportation and infrastructure. 
“If we care about climate change, we have to make transportation part of the solution,” Buttigieg said. “And we are, by mode-shifting trips to less climate- or carbon-intensive ways to get around, like giving people better options for public transit, reducing the emissions impact of the trips we do take, like making sure everybody can afford and use EVs, and so on.” 
Greenhouse gasses from transportation accounted for approximately 27% of emissions in the U.S. in 2020, largely due to increased demand for travel, perpetuating atmospheric warming and worsening climate conditions, according to a report from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
Buttigieg said it is necessary to make the U.S. a more equitable country through infrastructure policies such as job creation and improved transportation quality. 
“Good paying jobs, many of which are good-paying jobs that lead to good-paying careers that are available to people, whether you’ve got a college degree or not, are jobs that have historically not been open to workers of color and especially to women,” Buttigieg said. “We can change that, if we’re intentional about it.” 
People of color and low-income people are disproportionately harmed by environmental hazards and are more likely to live in areas of high pollution; oil and gas corporations often place high polluting facilities in or near communities of color, which contributes to an inequitable distribution of health risks. 
The Biden Administration and the EPA recently established a national office of environmental justice to advance the creation of a more equitable environment for communities of color living in highly polluted areas. 
Buttigieg closed the event by issuing a stark warning about the threats U.S. democracy faces, urging students to understand their moral authority in dictating future government policy.
“We’ve got to deliver results that people can feel are making their lives better, not only because it’s why we’re all out here, it’s what policy and politics and government is supposed to do, but also because whether we can do that or not is going to be maybe the biggest driver of whether we have enough public trust to stay a democracy, imperfect though it is,” Buttigieg said. “Those are colossal stakes.”
