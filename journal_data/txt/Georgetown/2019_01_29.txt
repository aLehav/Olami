Georgetown University Student Association president Juan Martinez (SFS ’20) and vice president Kenna Chick (SFS ’20) endorsed a proposed student referendum to create a semesterly fee that would go toward a fund to benefit descendants of the GU272 on Thursday. The pair announced their support four days after the GUSA senate delayed a vote on the referendum.
After postponing its Jan. 27 vote, the GUSA senate is now set to vote Feb. 2 on whether to hold the referendum to establish the fee. The mandatory fee of $27.20 per semester would be added to students’ tuitions and go toward a reconciliation fund to support the development of the descendants of the 272 enslaved individuals sold in 1838 by the Maryland Society of Jesus to financially sustain Georgetown.
The proposed GU272 reconciliation board of trustees, which would be made up of students and descendants, would oversee the allocation of the funds. If the referendum earns a majority of votes, the proposed reconciliation fund would still also require approval from the GUSA senate and the university’s board of directors.
Because reconciliation with descendant communities is central to the character and identity of the university, the referendum should occur to allow students the chance to offer their input, the executives wrote in a Jan. 31 statement.
“We encourage the senate to prioritize the importance of giving the student body a vote on this referendum in their debates and discussions,” Martinez and Chick wrote. “The student body should be able to have their voice heard; we urge the senate act accordingly.”
Students, GUSA senators, and members of the GU272 Advocacy Team, a group of students who advocate on campus for students and began the push for the referendum provided their input at Sunday’s meeting of the GUSA senate. After 90 minutes of debate and multiple proposed amendments at its Sunday meeting, the senate voted to table the act 15-11.
Amendments to the bill added term lengths to students appointed to the GU272 reconciliation board of trustees and gave the GUSA president the power to appoint students to the board, among other provisions.
The proposal does not currently possess the support of a majority of GUSA senators, though multiple senators declined to state their position.
Those advocating for the proposal said it offers a path for Georgetown to reconcile with the descendants of the GU272. 
“The involuntary sale of their ancestors is what enables the existence of our university, and I encourage us to remain cognizant of this reality throughout our conversation about this referendum,” GU272 Advocacy Team member Hannah Michael (SFS ’21) said at the senate meeting.
The 1838 sale brought in $3.3 million, when adjusted for inflation, allowing the university to pay off its debt.
Though former GUSA senator Sam Appel (COL ’20) sponsored the GUSA legislation, the GU272 Advocacy Team began its push for a referendum on the reconciliation fund in fall 2018. 
Appel introduced the bill to the GUSA senate’s ways and means committee, where it was delayed for a vote before being passed unanimously Jan. 23 for referral to the full senate. Appel resigned from the GUSA senate Monday and declined to comment on reasons behind his resignation. 
Appel said the financial aid office indicated that those receiving financial aid from the university would not have to pay the fee, but the board of directors has not made its stance on the referendum clear.
Several GUSA senators expressed opposition to the proposal. Some senators, including Gary Xie (SFS ’19), said they would prefer a voluntary contribution instead of a mandatory fee.
“If we’re making Georgetown students pay, I think that inevitably creates a lot more tension than we seek to address,” Xie said.
GUSA Senator Harrison Nugent (SFS ’20) said he opposed the motion because there were not enough constraints on the fund’s expenses.
“My big concern with this is that there aren’t enough regulatory guidelines or explicit proposals for spending this money for the board of trustees to accept it,” Nugent said.
The referendum should take place to understand more accurately the wishes of the entire student body and not simply the GUSA senate, according to Michael.
“I think the senators, regardless of what they think about this act, should support the referendum so students can engage in this dialogue,” Michael said. “There are a lot of students who are not represented, especially students of color, specifically black students, to whom this legacy is particularly important.”
However, much of the debate among senators centered around the proposed reconciliation fund itself.
The university is working to reconcile with its legacy of slavery through a process that includes recommendations from the Working Group on Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation and new ideas from the GU272 descendants, according to Matt Hill, a university spokesperson.
“We appreciate the engagement and support of students and GUSA and will continue to consult with students and other members of the university community as we work in partnership with Descendants on a process that recognizes the terrible legacy of slavery and promotes racial justice in southern Louisiana, southern Maryland and throughout the nation,” Hill wrote in an  email to The Hoya.
The university founded the Working Group in the fall of 2015 to engage members of the community in dialogue and outline recommendations to reflect on the university’s history of slavery. The Working Group released a 2016 report that outlined recommendations for how the university should proceed in acknowledging its relationship with slavery, including financial aid for descendants. 
Advocates are open to input from GUSA senators to improve the proposal, so long as they are not trying to undermine the act itself, according to Elizabeth Thomas (GRD ’19), a descendant of the GU272. Thomas said some GUSA senators are not taking this issue seriously.
“I wish that some of these senators would have taken more time to read into the referendum, because there were a lot of comments or questions that were addressed that were clearly stated in the referendum,” Thomas said in an interview with The Hoya.
GUSA Senator Hayley Grande (COL ’21), who declined to comment on whether she would support the bill, said there was little left to uncover through discussion.
“I feel all the arguments were put on the floor. No one was adding information, so now was the time,” Grande said after the meeting in an interview with The Hoya.
The delay offers time to improve the bill and facilitate cooperation, according to GUSA Senator Dylan Hughes (COL ’19), who supported the bill as it came out of the meeting Sunday.
“A lot of people, as we saw here, had ideas on improvements to make, but they couldn’t agree on those improvements,” Hughes said in an interview with The Hoya. “So it’s better to take more time to talk that out rather than rush it.”
The opportunity to financially contribute to the development of the descendant community presents a historic moment that is overdue, according to Mélisande Short-Colomb (COL ’21), who is a descendant of the GU272 and supports the referendum.
“As Georgetown students voting yes on this referendum, we put ourselves in the position of doing what has never been done in this country,” Short-Colomb said.

Johns Hopkins University is set to purchase the Newseum building, with plans to convert the space to hold its Washington, D.C.-based graduate programs, according to a Jan. 25 announcement from the university.
The sale remains subject to all regulatory approvals, and the museum will remain open to the public through 2019. The Newseum, an interactive museum which promotes free press and the first amendment, is looking to relocate within the D.C. area after Johns Hopkins assumes ownership over its former location.
Johns Hopkins already houses several of its graduate-level programs in the District, including the School of Advanced International Studies and the Carey Business School, located on Massachusetts Avenue.
With this purchase, worth $372.5 million, the university plans to consolidate the locations of these programs and deepen students’ connections to national and global events, Johns Hopkins president Ronald Daniels said in a news release.
“We will have an unparalleled opportunity to bring all of our current D.C.-based Johns Hopkins graduate programs together in a single, landmark, state-of-the-art building,” Daniels said. “The renovated building will provide opportunities for every academic division of the university to pursue research and educational activities in Washington.”
The Newseum had been struggling financially in recent years. The Newseum’s parent organization, the Freedom Forum, has given a total of $500 million in the past 20 years to keep to museum running. In 2015, the organization supplied one-third of the Newseum’s operating budget, according to The New York Times. The sale comes after a review of the Freedom Forum’s funding priorities which concluded the Newseum’s operational costs were unsustainable, according to a news release by the Newseum.
The Newseum received around 820,000 visitors in 2017, according to The New York Times. The Newseum, unlike the Smithsonian, charges a $25 entrance fee; however, this revenue still does cover the Newseum’s costs each year.
Part of the Newseum’s financial issues stem from the construction of the building itself. The building, which sold for $372.5 million, was originally constructed for $450 million, according to NPR. As a result of construction costs, the Newseum was still approximately $300 million in debt as of October 2017, according to The New York Times.
Interest rates on this debt spiked in 2016, causing more difficulty for the museum in terms of repayment. There have been four rounds of layoffs of Newseum staff, most recently in January 2017, according to The Washington Post.
Despite the sale of its building, the Newseum is planning to continue educating the public and displaying exhibits, according to CEO and Chair of the Freedom Forum Jan Neuharth.
“We stand ready to continue much of the Newseum’s important work for decades to come — through digital outreach, traveling exhibits, and web-based programs in schools around the world, as well as hopefully in a new physical home in the area,” Jan Neuharth wrote in a news release.

The longest government shutdown in U.S. history ended Friday after a 35-day partisan standoff between President Donald Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) over immigration policy.
Trump signed a bill Jan. 25 that fully reopens the government until Feb. 15. The bill does not contain funding for a border wall, a demand of Trump’s that Democrats refused to fulfill, which resulted in the standoff that led to the partial government shutdown.
Beyond funding the government for three weeks, the bill establishes bipartisan House and Senate committees tasked with drafting a border security agreement to be added to a spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security.
The bill also guarantees the roughly 800,000 federal employees furloughed during the shutdown will receive back pay after having missed two paychecks. Federal employees returned to work Monday and will receive their missed wages as soon as possible, but the exact timing will vary by agency, according to The Hill.
Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney (SFS ’89) told CBS News that Federal employees should receive their back pay before Sunday, 
“We hope that by the end of this week, all of the back pay will be made up and, of course, the next payroll will go out on time,” Mulvaney said.
Numerous federal agencies have begun to reopen and return to normal operations. Sonny Perdue, Trump’s Secretary of Agriculture, thanked employees who worked without pay in a Jan. 25 news release. Thousands of employees will be able to return to work due to the reopening, Perdue said.
“President Trump’s announcement of the reopening of the federal government is welcome news, as it will bring thousands of our employees back to work and return us to our mission of providing our customers with the services they rely upon,” Perdue said. 
Despite not getting the funds he demanded, Trump claimed victory in a Rose Garden speech on Friday. Though congressional Democrats did not declare triumph over Trump, many, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), saw the standoff as a show of strength from House Democrats and Pelosi.
“No one should ever underestimate the speaker, as Donald Trump has learned,” Schumer said to the Washington Post.
Trump continued to demand border wall funding be included in the agreement in his Friday Rose Garden address.
“If we don’t get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on February 15th, again or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and the Constitution of the United States to address this emergency,” Trump said.
The National Governors Association had penned a Jan. 7 letter to the federal government three weeks ago calling for the shutdown to end. After the end of the shutdown, NGA chair, Montana Governor Steve Bullock (D-Mont.), and NGA vice chair, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan (R-Md.), released a statement Jan. 25.
“The NGA is grateful that the president and Congress came to a short-term agreement to reopen the government, and is hopeful that they can find a long-term compromise on issues currently dividing the nation,” the letter said.
While the reopening of the government is a step in the right direction, Congress still needs address the issue of border security, which has yet to be resolved, according to Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, an immigration and criminal justice reform activist group.
“We call on Congress also to urgently address the crisis facing Dreamers and TPS holders, whose lives have been thrown into chaos due to the actions of the Trump Administration,” Schulte said in a Jan. 25 news release. “This is a true crisis; there is absolutely no reason for delay.”
Additionally, Congress needs to consider a funding bill that gives federal workers guaranteed pay, according to Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the United States. 
“Federal workers urgently need their back pay distributed; in the case of federal contractors, they still need it to be authorized. And both deserve a long-term funding bill — not one that leaves them hanging with just a single guaranteed paycheck,” Trumka said in a Jan. 25 news release. “This is a temporary fix to an extraordinary failure of governance.”

Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) introduced a bill allowing the Washington, D.C. Council to pass laws without waiting for review from Congress Jan. 24.
Currently, every civil and criminal bill passed by the local government in D.C. must be reviewed by the U.S. Congress before going into effect. During the review period, Congress can pass a resolution blocking D.C. bills from becoming laws. Civil legislation is reviewed for 30 legislative days and criminal legislation for 60.
The congressional review period for D.C. legislation is rarely used by Congress, Norton said in a Jan. 24 press release. Since 1991, Congress has only overturned three D.C. bills.
Legislative autonomy would allow the District to have more certainty as to when bills take effect and benefit the taxpayer by eliminating administrative costs, according to Norton.
“The District currently has no certainty when D.C. bills, covering major issues such as taxes and regulations, will take effect,” Norton said. “Under my bill, Congress would maintain its plenary authority to block or overturn D.C. legislation at any time.”
Because the D.C. Council often has to pass legislation in three different forms — emergency, temporary, and permanent — for bills to take effect, the council could eliminate 50 to 60 percent of the bills its passes if the legislative review process did not exist, according to a Feb. 4, 2015, news release by Norton’s office. The council estimates the bill would save 5,000 employee hours and 160,000 sheets of paper, Norton said.
D.C. should receive equal legal footing with the rest of the United States, Bo Shuff, executive director for D.C. Vote, a group that pushes for equal representation for the District, said. The bill will hopefully pass in both houses due to its focus on local government, Shuff said in an interview with The Hoya.
“I would expect that with Congresswoman Norton being in the House and the House being under her colleagues’ control it would probably be an easier path through the House than through the Senate, but I think it would be consistent with both parties’ views that local control and local government is important,” Shuff said. 
Norton’s push for legislative autonomy is the first of a series of bills Norton intends to introduce called “Free and Equal D.C.,” that will aim to give D.C. and its citizens more autonomy and equality while pursuing statehood. The series comes after Norton introduced H.R. 51, the Washington, D.C. Admission Act on Jan. 3. H.R. 51 would incorporate D.C. as the 51st state in the union. It has won a record 155 original cosponsors and the support of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. 
D.C. attained budget autonomy in March 18, 2016, which allows the D.C. Council to implement a local spending plan without prior congressional approval. The increased financial freedom that D.C. will experience due to budget autonomy puts it one step closer to statehood, according to Mayor Muriel Bowser (D).
“With our first budget under the Budget Autonomy becoming law today, the District of Columbia passes another mile marker to our final destination: statehood,” Bowser said in a news release. “With the 30-day Congressional review period in our rearview mirror, our Administration can give residents greater certainty that their locally raised tax dollars will be used for their priorities in the upcoming fiscal year.”
Norton previously introduced a bill to grant D.C. legislative autonomy in 2015, but it never made it out of committee. Under the Obama administration, Bowser and Norton began a renewed push for D.C. autonomy and statehood, but historically Republicans have stymied such efforts because statehood would most likely increase the number of Democratic senators in Congress. Norton’s bill on legislative autonomy awaits committee review in the House.
Norton elaborated on her plans in a video posted on her Twitter account Thursday.
“I’m embarking on a two-track strategy to get the district as much freedom from Congress as fast as I can,” Norton said in the video.
Statehood is one track of “Free and Equal D.C.,” and legislative autonomy is the other according to Norton. Eliminating the congressional review period is jumping off point for the ultimate goal of greater self-governance for the district, Norton said, acknowledging that statehood may take a long time to become a reality.
“Meanwhile, there are at least 16 bills that this Congress — and remember we have a Democratic Congress — could pass that would get us closer to statehood,” Norton said. “Legislative autonomy is a perfect bill to begin.”
