Jack’s Boathouse has lost its lease at the Georgetown waterfront after more than fifty years of serving students and the community.
The National Park Service, which owns the land, sent boathouse owner Paul Simkin a letter on December 18 requiring him to vacate the premises by January 31, according to the Washington Post.
However, the Post also reported that the NPS is offering a concession to operate recreational activities on the waterfront, which Simkin can apply to run.
A petition on change.org to stop the closure currently has 1698 signatures. The web page states that NPS Director Jon Jarvis has told his staff to cease action on the lease termination until further review is conducted.
