Rev. Patrick Desbois, professor of the practice of the forensic study of the Holocaust at Georgetown University, received the 2017 Lantos Human Rights Prize in an Oct. 26 ceremony on Capitol Hill for his work documenting Holocaust victims and leading educational programs on genocide.
The prize, established in 2009 by the Lantos Foundation for Human Rights and Justice in honor of its founder, the late congressman and Holocaust survivor Tom Lantos (D-Calif.), is awarded every year to an exemplary advocate for global human rights. Past recipients include the Dalai Lama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and 1986 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Elie Wiesel.
Desbois is the founder and president of Yahad-In Unum, an international humanitarian organization that identifies and collects forensic evidence on Jewish and Roma mass execution sites across eight former Soviet countries in Eastern Europe. The group also leads educational programs and outreach campaigns about the Holocaust and contemporary genocides.
Desbois called for greater activism against demonstrations of hate, such as those of last August in Charlottesville, Va., to avoid future instances of genocide. Drawing from experience, Desbois said that leaders have to fight the tendency to become desensitized by frequent public atrocities.
“There is no genocide without a neighbor,” Desbois said during his acceptance speech. “We have to teach people to one day take responsibility. The more you advertise a mass crime, the less people react. You see that in Charlottesville, you see it in the Bundestag. We have to wake up.”
In a video shown during the ceremony, Desbois explained that his work was inspired by the life of his grandfather, a French prisoner held at the Rawa Ruska concentration camp on the Ukraine-Poland boarder during World War II. Since founding Yahad-In Unum in 2004, Desbois has interviewed over 5,500 witnesses of genocides and identified over 2,000 execution sites.
The ceremony, conducted in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill, featured remarks from Annette Lantos Tillemann-Dick, co-chair of the Lantos Foundation Advisory Board and daughter of its namesake, and representatives Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) and Jamie Raskin (D-Md.).
Raskin praised the mission of Desbois’ organization as shining a light on current and historical victims of genocide.
“His project comes down to one word: memory,” Raskin said. “We must once again speak up for human rights here and abroad.”
As Braman endowed professor of the practice of the forensic study of the Holocaust, Desbois teaches the undergraduate courses of “Holocaust by Bullets” and “What Really Happened in the Camps?” through the Center for Jewish Civilization at Georgetown.
The former revolves around Desbois’ forensic work and identification of victims within mass graves, while the latter analyzes the psychological and sociological elements of concentration camps.
“It is difficult to teach, and it is a subject that is difficult to internalize,” said Nicole McCann Ramirez (COL ’18), a former student of both courses who attended the ceremony. “But [Desbois] is coming from a standpoint of teaching this for change and provoking the reality of what human existence is. It is an understanding of history based on the stories of the victims.”
When asked about the difficult, emotional nature of his work, Desbois said the emotional nature of his work is challenging, but he is thankful he does not do it alone. He said he hopes his 29-person team and his students will continue his legacy.
“I would say they are the future,” Desbois said.
Lantos Tillemann-Dick said in an interview with The Hoya that she hoped Desbois’s work would inspire further conversation on how to avoid the repetition of historical patterns due to ignorance.
“I remember asking my parents about the Holocaust and saying, ‘What about America? What about the Americans?’ My dad said, ‘You know, people are living their lives. They did not even really know,’” Lantos Tillemann-Dick said. “So this is my hope that students like you, that newspapers like The Hoya will feature these stories, will pursue them, will follow up on them and build the volume of protest.”

A lack of policy cohesion plagues the Republican Party and ultimately hinders its productivity and efficiency, Charles Cooke, editor of the conservative publication National Review Online, argued at an event Oct. 26.
Cooke discussed the trajectory of the Republican Party, the future of federalism in the United States and the anger driving liberal and conservative politics at an event hosted by the Georgetown University Lecture Fund, Georgetown University College Republicans and Georgetown University College Democrats.
Both Democrats and Republicans are misrepresented in the court of public opinion, Cooke said.
“The Republican Party, although it looks strong at the moment, is somewhat flattered to deceive. So if you are a Republican in the audience, you should probably be aware that it looks better for Republicans than it probably is, and if you’re a Democrat, be aware that it probably looks worse for Democrats than it actually is,” Cooke said.
Cooke attributed this disparity between appearance and reality to the Republicans’ electoral dominance in federal and state governments, combined with a “civil war” occurring between moderate establishment Republicans and more populist politicians allied with President Donald Trump. Currently, the GOP controls 34 governorships and holds majorities in 33 state legislatures.
“We have a tendency in the press to look at who won the last election and extrapolate out from there how things will always be. You go back to 2008 when Barack Obama won his first election, you saw all these books published: ‘The End of Conservatism,’ ‘The Republican Party is Dead,’” Cooke said. “His ascendant coalition was forever going to sweep in Obama-style candidates to Congress, to the states, to the White House. And it didn’t happen.”
Cooke said that Trump will join former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama as nontransformational presidents because Trump lacks understanding of American politics and presidential behavior.
Trump’s failure to transform American politics is related directly to fragmentation within both major political parties, especially the GOP, according to Cooke.
“The Republican Party is not really the Republican Party at the moment in the way the Democratic Party is not really the Democratic Party. The Republican Party is a number of parties that have united under one banner,” Cooke said.
This party fragmentation inevitably leads to challenges in Congress, where attempts at a moderate agenda alienate more conservative members, and attempts at a conservative agenda alienate moderate members. Cooke said this dynamic hinders Republicans, particularly Trump, from passing any substantive legislation. Trump and the GOP most recently failed to reach agreement on healthcare reform.
Trump’s inability to govern productively has left many matters to other branches of government, as well as state and local governments, according to Cooke. Cooke said this gives him reason for optimism about a return to federalism within American politics.
“He has, whether deliberately or not, set the stage for a reduction in presidential power and a return of some powers to the states and Congress, which is incredibly important,” Cooke said. “If Donald Trump doesn’t usher in a renaissance in what I consider to be the key conservative principle, which is federalism and separation of powers, then nobody will.”
Technology has led to centralization in the United States, Cooke said, bringing the country together through social media and online platforms. For this reason, Americans must try to respect and engage with those who have differing political views.
“The fact is, the hipster in Brooklyn and the Baptist in Mississippi have very little in common, not even the same language in some ways. And if they’re to thrill to the same flag, then we’re going to have to give them some breathing room. The advantage, of course, of this argument is that that’s actually the way the country is set up,” Cooke said.
The absence of federalism is intimately connected to the anger driving American politics, of which Trump is a symptom and not a cause, Cooke said.
Cooke emphasized that he was not excusing Trump’s hyper-partisan behavior, but that the rise of both Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) suggests that there is an independent variable at play. Anger and anti-establishment sentiment are driving American elections.
“We are not, I think, in the moment that many people fear, or many people hope. Donald Trump is not going to become Hitler. He’s also not going to become Ronald Reagan,” Cooke said. “He will of course do things that conservatives such as myself like a great deal. When he does, his party will almost certainly stand with him.”

Latin American countries must overcome significant infrastructure problems before transitioning to more sustainable forms of energy, according to a panel of energy experts Oct. 27.
Hosted by Georgetown’s Latin American Policy Association, a student group that analyzes Latin American domestic policy, as a part of the Extractive Industries in Latin America: Opportunities, Challenges and the Way Forward conference, the panel featured Daniele La Porta, senior managing specialist at the World Bank, Andrés Flores, director of energy at the World Resources Institute Mexico, Tomás González, former minister for mines and energy in Colombia, and Georgetown University professor Camille Gaskin-Reyes.
The group discussed the challenges facing Latin American countries like Colombia, Venezuela, Panama and Mexico, in combatting climate change, sustaining economic growth and pushing for sustainable energy.
Gonzalez said these countries should prioritize adapting their economies for renewable energy to ensure their citizens have affordable future options.
“If you want to promote growth, you need to ensure that every time [someone] needs to turn on an oven, needs to turn on the lights, or needs to use electricity, the electricity is going to be there,” Gonzalez said. “Otherwise, it’s going to be very difficult to have to sustain growth.”
Gonzalez said these countries should remain committed to the 2016 Paris climate agreement, a United Nations convention between 196 countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions beginning in 2020.
“We need to ensure that we have the mechanisms to spread renewables as fast as we can with the technology that allows us to be increasingly competitive,” Gonzales said.
La Porta said mining is essential to procuring green technologies. She cited a World Bank study that indicated that increased development of low-carbon implements has led to an increase in the demand for minerals like zinc, steel and copper.
“Everybody knows, without minerals, there would simply be no low-carbon future possible,” La Porta said.
La Porta said mining companies should invest in meeting the demands of the Paris agreement. However, she noted that for this investment to be effective, Latin American countries would need a radical restructuring of their energy supply and transmission systems.
“A green technology future is materially intensive and, if not properly managed, could bely the efforts and policies of supplying countries to meet their objectives of meeting climate and related sustainable goals,” La Porta said.
Flores, comparing La Porta’s argument to Mexico’s situation, said the country will struggle to meet its goal of a 22 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 because doing so requires shifting energy resources from the production of oil, where Mexico is a leading player, to that of steel, where it possesses no similar competitiveness.
Currently, Mexico’s state-managed oil company, Pemex, is implementing a national energy reform directive to modernize its facilities around the country and open up to private investment.
However, Flores said Mexico’s struggles do not stem from a lack of energy resources, but from a lack of coordination in supplying them to each industry. In spite of this, he expects the country to continue working towards procuring these green, steel-based technologies and working towards fulfilling its objective.
“It makes sense to push for this transition, even though there are barriers to it,” Flores said.
According to Gaskin-Reyes, who previously worked at the World Bank, Latin American and Caribbean countries also face the challenge of balancing continued resource extraction with the welfare of indigenous communities. Countries seeking greater access to natural resources often face resistance from indigenous people who reside in resource rich regions.
Gaskin-Reyes called for these countries to enact long-term energy plans that incorporated consultation and cooperation with these communities, as well as government accountability, transparency and oversight, to ensure these resources are managed in a way that leads to long-term benefits for the entire population.
“Take extra care about these things,” Gaskin-Reyes said. “Be active and proactive in managing the resource base, and looking at the long term. Governments are notoriously short-term, but be active in thinking of setting up the structure that is going to combat the structure of heaviness to a sustainable government.”
