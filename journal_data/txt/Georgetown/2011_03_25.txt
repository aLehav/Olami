A crowd of 15 students and activists gathered at the Mortara Center on Wednesday evening to protest a speech by former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe Velez, rekindling the demonstrations that punctuated his arrival on campus and continued throughout the fall semester.
Uribe’s appointment as a Distinguished Scholar in the Practice of Global Leadership in the School of Foreign Service last year sparked ire from the Adios Uribe coalition, which claims that Uribe was responsible for large-scale human rights abuses during his presidency.
Hoisting signs that read “Desecrating Jesuit Values” and “Generating Bad Press for Georgetown,” the protesters were forced to stay on the sidewalk across from the center, which is located at 36th and O streets, by Department of Public Safety officers and members of the event staff.
Alleging that Uribe has committed various war crimes and human rights violations, the protesters vowed to continue to voice their concerns until some compromise about Uribe’s role is reached.
“They say they want dialogue, but they won’t dialogue with us directly,” Walker Grooms (GRD ’11) said.
Grooms added that the group hopes to have a direct meeting with University President John J. DeGioia, who he believes is the only person who can reverse the appointment of Uribe as a distinguished scholar. According to university officials, however, Uribe’s appointment is not slated to extend past this academic year.
“President Uribe’s commitment is for one academic year and that remains the case,” university spokeswoman Julie Bataille said in an email to The Hoya in December.
The protesters also complained about the lack of transparency in Uribe’s schedule, saying that the secrecy hinders their efforts and the general student body’s ability to access a resource on campus.
According to a March 13 article in The Chronicle of Higher Education, Uribe’s lectures are off the record.
Adios Uribe is planning to have more protests this semester once they get a better grasp on where Uribe will be.
“We just wanted to come out and let Uribe know we’re here,” Cassandra Waters (LAW ’13) said.

Georgetown’s proximity to the center of the nation’s political scene is often pegged as one of its perks. For a select group of students, however, being part of the action is an everyday occurrence.
According to the White House, at least 21 current students and alumni across all of the university’s campuses and programs have worked for the presidency in some capacity as part of the White House internship program since the start of the Obama administration.
The program draws a wide array of applicants, and Georgetown’s students have had differing reasons for throwing their hat in the ring for a chance to get a behind-the-scenes look at how policy is conducted and meet the nation’s power players.
“My friends know I’ve never been particularly passionate about politics, but I thought the White House internship epitomized everything I love about going to school in D.C. — it’s a rare opportunity to affect and serve our nation,” James Li (MSB ’13), a current intern with the Communications Office in the Office of the Vice President, said in a written response to The Hoya.
Other students were more focused on gaining tangible experience in fields in which they plan on pursuing careers.
“I wanted to gain policy experience at the highest level of government,” Riley Wells (GRD ’11), also a current intern, said in a written response to The Hoya.
The road to working at the highest level of government is a competitive one. Individuals from all across the country apply for these full-time, unpaid internships for each of the three annual work cycles.
While Wells described the application itself as “simple” — students need to respond to application questions, supply a résumé and submit three separate letters of recommendation — there is no set of qualifications that guarantees success. Besides a commitment to service and a demonstration of leadership, a commitment to the mission of the Obama administration is another key component of the selection criteria, according to the program’s website.
Once the application process is over, the experience of working in the White House varies by department.
Wells works in the Gift Office in the Office of Presidential Correspondence.
“Each day, I handle and process the gifts the president receives and send them to their appropriate destination,” Wells said, describing a typical day.
This is no ordinary filing job — Wells is able to see what celebrities, foreign officials and everyday Americans send to the president.
Katelyn Horne (SFS ’12), a former White House intern, who worked in White House Operations but was not associated with the White House internship program, chuckled at the idea of a “typical” day for her.
“It varied day to day,” she said. “I helped to advance and staff [the president] during public events.”
In the West Wing, Horne worked at times near the biggest powerbrokers in the White House. Horne said one of the most valuable aspects of her position was learning how government operates at the highest levels.
“This was an unbelievable experience for a freshman,” she said.
The experience gained during the internship has not been the only positive result for students. The program has been a major résumé boost and led to unique opportunities. Horne, for instance, continued working for the White House after her internship and was able to travel to Guam for two weeks as a part of the presidential advance team during the president’s March 2010 trip to Asia.
Partly through her experiences and contacts at the White House, Horne was able to acquire an internship with U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations Susan Rice and is currently working in the Office of African Affairs in the Office of the United States Trade Representative.
Career opportunities aside, working at the heart of the presidency affords interns once-in-a-lifetime experiences every workday of the week.
“One that sticks out in my mind was watching Marine One (the president’s helicopter) land. Not only was this the first time that I saw the president in person, but it was incredible to wait on the South Lawn (something I’ve only caught glimpses of through the gates) and watch the huge helicopter land,” Li said.
Horne added that she was overwhelmed by how big the Oval Office was the first time she was able to step inside.
While the occasional “star sighting” is not at the core of the job, all of the interns interviewed by The Hoya agreed that their experiences lived up to the hype and were more than worth the time commitment.
Being at the center of the buzzing political atmosphere, the students acknowledged that they sometimes forgot that they were interns. Li recounted one time when the heady company with which they shared the White House’s offices gave them a good-natured reminder.
“Once, I was returning to my office when we were stopped by Secret Service. Suddenly, the president’s aide Reggie Love walked by, followed soon by the president himself, about five feet away from us. Turning and acknowledging us, [Obama] asked, ‘You guys interns?’ Shocked and in awe, we replied that we were. ‘Thought so. You’ve got that intern look.'”

The National Federation of the Blind filed a complaint to multiple universities last week, calling their use of Google programs like those used by Georgetown discriminatory toward blind students.
Both New York University and Northwestern University recently adopted Google Apps for Education, which provides each student with a Gmail account, according to a March 15 NFB press release. Georgetown has similar applications, requiring students to use Hoyamail, the campus email system hosted by Google. Hoyamail also provides access to other Google Apps for Education, including the calendar and Google Docs.
These programs, including Gmail, are not compatible with text readers that convert written text into spoken words or Braille, according to the press release. As a result, blind students are unable to fully use these programs, a fact that poses problems for students at universities requiring use of Gmail.
According to Rachel Pugh, director of media relations at Georgetown, there are alternative options for Georgetown students who are unable to use Google programs.
“University Information Services does have in place provisions to provide a different email account, file sharing account or other technologies to any student or faculty member who requires this assistance,” she said. “While Google Docs is only available to students for general use rather than primary class activities, a student with a disability is still encouraged to contact the Academic Resource Center to arrange for alternative accommodations.”
According to NFB Director of Public Relations Chris Danielsen, the federation filed a request for investigation with the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of blind students at both New York University and Northwestern University. The investigation will look at their recent adoption of Google Apps for Education and determine whether or not they have violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
Danielsen expressed his desire for program changes that would make such web services available for blind students.
“Obviously these universities should not use these apps unless or until they are accessible to all students. We also hope that Google will do everything in its power to make these programs more accessible,” Danielsen said.
Google expressed its willingness to make its programs more accessible. Google Senior Vice President for Engineering and Research Alan Eustace recently met with NFB President Marc Maurer to discuss accessibility issues.
“Recently we had a productive discussion with Dr. Marc Maurer of the National Federation for the Blind, and he shared a powerful message on the importance of accessibility,” he said in an email. “We left the meeting with a strong commitment to improving our products.”
An article in the Washington Post stated that the Northwestern administration had not heard of any complaints, and did not have a comment. However, NYU Vice President for Public Affairs John Beckman commented that the university plans to take the concerns of the NFB into account when implementing the new technology. As of yet, NYU has not fully implemented Google Apps for Education.
Danielsen was unsure whether or not NYU or Northwestern University had any such alternative options in place, but stressed that this was not the main issue.
“It isn’t whether they have an alternative option, it’s a matter of separate but equal. For example, a collaborative project using Google Docs. To the extent that a student has to use separate technology inherently puts the student at a disadvantage. Separate is not equal,” he said.
Director of the Academic Resource Center Jane Holahan declined to comment and referred any further questions to UIS.

Though­ unpaid internships have long been a staple of a Georgetown education, they may not always be legal.
Last April, the Economic Policy Institute issued a report titled, “Not So Equal Protection — Reforming the Regulation of Student Internships,” which questions the legality of unpaid internships and called for greater federal regulation.
“This paper contends that the current system of regulations governing internships must be reformed, both for the immediate protection of students’ rights and also to maintain a strong and vibrant labor market that compensates all workers fairly,” the report says.
The report argues that a lack of clear regulations makes student interns vulnerable to workplace discrimination and incentivizes replacing paid employees with unpaid interns. It also stated that unpaid internships are unfair to students who cannot afford to spend a summer or semester working for no pay.
Whether or not they are aware of the issues cited in the report, many Georgetown students continue to hold unpaid internships. According to a survey of the Class of 2010 conducted by the Career Education Center, 83 percent of students reported having had at least one internship while at Georgetown.
Patricia Kehoe (SFS ’12) has held two unpaid internships during her time on the Hilltop. Currently she works a part time job in addition to her internship to make up for the fact that she is not being paid.
“In the case of an unpaid internship the student needs to be sure that it’s something they enjoy doing, and it’s something that will further their career, otherwise it’s not worth it,” Kehoe said.
Not all students, however, have the option of making that tradeoff, especially if the internship hours run long. Professor Thomas Cooke, who teaches the one-credit Internship in Business course, believes that it is wrong not to pay a student for doing legitimate work.
“The system is clearly prejudiced against students without resources to cover room and board,” Cooke said. “If there’s [an employee] down the hall doing the same work and getting paid, then that’s fundamentally unfair to the student working without compensation.”
According to Kehoe, legitimate work is exactly what unpaid interns are doing.
“I’ve heard of students who have had to take work home with them and skip classes. There’s a lot of pressure to do the work of a paid employee even though you’re an unpaid intern,” she said.
Ross Eisenbrey, vice president of the Economic Policy Institute, said that unpaid internships also set a bad precedent.
“They’re making it all right for employers not to pay people for their work,” he said.
According to Eisenbrey, unpaid internships require federal regulation because students are often afraid to speak out, even if their position is being abused. He talked to several student interns in D.C. who felt they needed to accept their position as unpaid interns.
“If the internship is ongoing and the intern blows the whistle, they could be fired,” he said.
“They were more interested in having at this point the employer on their resume and having a good recommendation than being paid for their time. [Whistleblowing] is something that scares most people because they’re afraid that they’ll be blacklisted. Student interns are reluctant to assert their rights.”
According to Eisenbrey, this trend has implications even beyond the student demographic.
“For society as a whole, we’re getting to a bad place,” he said.
The release of the report coincided with the announcement of more stringent regulations on what qualifies as a legal unpaid internship. In January 2010, the Department of Labor released six criteria for unpaid internships at for-profit companies. Among these are the requirement of on-the-job training, and the requirement that the employer “derives no immediate advantage” from the work of the intern.
According to Robin Richards, chairman and Chief Executive Officer of internships.com, the Department of Labor’s regulations are impractical.
“To me, an employer deriving no immediate benefit from the activity of the intern is unrealistic,” he said. “I don’t think anyone I’ve ever spoken to wouldn’t agree that the current Department of Labor criteria do require a little bit of altering.”
Nina Ravi (SFS ’12), who currently holds an unpaid internship at Emily’s List, agreed.
“I’m kind of skeptical about [the Department of Labor’s] definition,” she said. “The point of an intern is to do the very basic work that the boss could be paid to do but it would be a waste of time for them to do. I don’t necessarily see that as a bad thing because it’s essentially job training for the future, and you’re definitely getting something out of it even if it’s not monetary compensation.”
Richards said that government regulation of unpaid internships would do more harm than good.
“Let’s not kill what has always been one of America’s great institutions. Experiential learning has been a special piece of capitalism. It’s critical that we don’t stifle this with government intervention,” he said.
Cooke agreed.
“The less government intrusion the better,” he said. “The government steps in and at the end of the day there are fewer internships.”
Instead, Cooke feels that students are best qualified to make decisions about the value of their unpaid internships.
“The question is: internships at what price? And I think that’s a decision the student has to make,” he said.
Georgetown offers services to help students make that decision. Internships are not posted on the Career Center’s Hoya Career Connection until a Career Center staff member has reviewed the internship and spoken with the employer, according to Career Center Director Mike Schaub. Additionally, the one-credit courses offered for internships in business, government and journalism help to give structure and faculty oversight to an unpaid internship.
Cooke expressed high confidence in Georgetown’s internship advising system.
“We have top-notch faculty advisers that have that depth of knowledge for students,” he said.
Cooke also requires students in his Internship in Business class to write a report about their experience at the end of the semester.
Ultimately, many students and faculty feel that internships are an invaluable part of the Georgetown experience.
“An internship is often the most important, educational and practical experience a student will get in college,” Cooke said.
Kehoe agreed that her internship prepared her for her future career.
“The opportunities I’ve gotten at my internships have been more than enough to make up for not being paid,” she said.

The Office of International Programs decided to suspend all study abroad programs in Japan Monday evening, according to Director of OIP Laura Monarch.
The U.S. travel warning for Japan, urging American citizens to delay travel to the country, which was struck by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami two weeks ago, was a large factor in the university’s decision, Monarch said.
“Sadly, the earthquake, tsunami and unfolding nuclear crisis leave continuing uncertainty over the potential for strong aftershocks, transportation difficulties, power outages and radioactive fallout through the air or food supply,” Monarch wrote in an email to affected students Monday evening. The seven students studying in Tokyo for the full year had temporarily departed Japan last week.
Students said they were frustrated that their stay has been cut short, but that the university’s decision is sound.
Michael Goulet (COL ’12), who had planned to study at Sophia University in Tokyo for the spring semester, said he understands the university’s decision.
“I don’t blame Georgetown at all,” he said. “I don’t think it’s fully safe.”
But the cancellation of the semester still comes as a disappointment to Goulet.
 
“I have lost that opportunity now to go abroad,” he said. “I still haven’t fully processed how I feel about it.”
John Shuler (COL ’12), who was also set to study at Sophia University, said it was a challenge since he has been planning for this semester for over a year.
“It was difficult for a lot of us given that we applied in February of 2010,” he said.
Michael Carter (COL ’12), who had also planned to study at Sophia University, is missing the opportunity to meet family he has in Japan.
“Especially with the recent events, I was very intent on seeing if they were alright for myself,” he said. “There is a small part of me that would have liked to be a part of history as well, I suppose.”
The students now have to deal with the academic and financial consequences of a cancelled semester. The university is recommending summer courses so that students can still graduate on time and is helping students cover any financial costs incurred by the program suspension.
Goulet said that the university has been helpful throughout the entire process.
“Georgetown has been incredibly great about it so far,” he said. “They totally understand this has been very difficult for us.”
Georgetown has allowed students to take up to five courses at school this summer, as opposed to keeping the cap at four, and will also offer courses in Japanese, according to Goulet. The affected students’ deans have also been in touch regarding their future academic plans.
The university has offered to help make summer housing in D.C. more affordable, and help students iron out any difficulties, such as having to take out loans or needing refunds.
While most students are upset at the loss of a semester overseas, they realize how lucky they are to be out of harm’s way.
“I can only be so disappointed because I’m safe,” Goulet said. “People’s lives in Japan have been ruined.”
Shuler said that instead of dwelling on his situation, he is focusing his thoughts toward those in Japan.
“We should be directing our sadness to what happened in Japan,” he said.

Dahlgren Chapel, the university’s central location for Catholic worship, will undergo major renovations later this year to remedy water damage to its foundation.
Fr. Philip Boroughs, S.J., vice president for Mission and Ministry, said the university is still working with engineers and architects to determine a specific timeline for the repairs, which will take about 15 months of work and entail the removal and repair of its stained-glass windows along with other structural work.
Cracks were first noticed around the chapel’s rose window in the fall of 2007 after falling plaster led the university to temporarily close the chapel. The window was then removed in the fall of 2009 to protect the glass after the walls around the window were found to be bowed. The university then began investigating the structural integrity of the chapel.
“We’ve been monitoring this for a couple of years,” Boroughs said.
He added that the university plans to release a final timeline for the repairs in the next few weeks.
“Now is the time when we really need to do something about it,” he said.
Boroughs said the chapel, which first opened in 1893, will remain open during the majority of the work but will have to close for short periods to allow for some of the interior work to take place. Construction will also impact the Dahlgren courtyard area.
“We are going to try and do as much as possible as discretely as possible as discreetly as possible,” Boroughs said.
While Boroughs said that cost estimates for the job are not yet available, the university is already working with potential donors to fund the restorations.
“Because of the generosity of donors, we have the opportunity to preserve and protect this beautiful icon,” he said.
Kevin Kuehl (SFS ’11), who has been attending Mass at Dahlgren Chapel since his freshman year, said he thinks the chapel is in dire need of renovations. During his first week attending Mass, plaster fell from a wall, causing the temporary closure.
He added that while Dahlgren is the most focal place of worship on campus, there are many other places to go for Mass, such as Copley Crypt or nearby Holy Trinity Church.
“It’s just going to need to be a sacrifice that needs to be made,” Kuehl said.
Francis Leung (SFS ’13), president of the Catholic Student Association, said that while Dahlgren Chapel is the center of Catholic student life at Georgetown, he is not concerned about the construction’s impact on campus spiritual life.
“As long as the community is there, and that community spirit is strong, it doesn’t really matter,” Leung said.

Although the historic Healy Pub dried up over 20 years ago, talk of a revival flowed freely across campus this week.
One of 23 proposed allocations submitted to the Georgetown University Student Association for the $3.4 million available in the Student Activities Fee Endowment, the bid for a social hub in campus’s most iconic building calls for a student lounge, restaurant, bar and performance venue.
Originally founded in 1974, the student-run Healy Pub was located in the basement of Healy Hall until it shut its doors in 1988, due in part to a revenue shortage caused by mandatory dry nights and the raising of the drinking age from 18 to 21 in 1984.
Matt Stoller (COL ’08), who submitted the pitch for a rekindled hangout, said the student-owned and operated pub would be open to community members, regardless of age.
Comparable projects at other universities, such as Harvard’s Queen Head Pub, have cost around $3 million, according to the proposal drafted by Stoller.
SAFE, which was allocated half of each student’s Student Activities Fee since the fall of 2001, was freed up for spending as part of the SAFE reform passed via student body referendum last semester.
In February, GUSA formed a committee to review proposals and submit recommendations for the appropriation of the money remaining in the fund after the initial distribution of money to student groups. The resulting plan, chosen by the body following two town halls this spring, will be put to a student vote this April.
The proposal has been signed by 21 current and former campus leaders, including five past and present GUSA presidents
and vice presidents, two past and present student Advisory Neighborhood Commission members and the current chief executive officer of The Corp. Backers of the proposal are capitalizing on Facebook, Twitter and bringbackhealypub.com to spread the word to the student body. At press time, the Facebook event had 1,662 attendees and its Facebook page had 775 likes.
GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff Chris Pigott (COL ’12), who is leading the on-campus campaign to resurrect Healy Pub, said that the plan focused on student life, neighborhood relations and alumni relations.
“The [Report on Student Space] shows that [student space] is the number one issue facing students at Georgetown,” Pigott said. “The same report also shows that social spaces, study spaces, dining spaces and meeting spaces are the most desired forms of spaces on campus.”
The study, conducted from 2008 to 2010, found that 88 percent of students polled supported reinstating student space in Healy Hall, according to Fitz Lufkin (COL ’11), an author of the student space report.
Amy Wiggington (COL ’14) said that the need for space on campus remains.
“I think that Georgetown needs more space to sit and study. I’m tired of being in [Lauinger Library] and having no space to sit. It would be nice to have another place than The Corp,” Wiggington said.
“The Healy Pub once satisfied all of these student desires and has been sorely missed for almost 25 years,” Pigott added.  “Students would be able to eat, drink, study, meet, perform, present, bartend, cook and dance in the most central and iconic building on campus.”
Neighborhood relations could also be improved with the addition of a pub on campus, according to Jake Sticka (COL ’13), the student commissioner on the ANC-2E.
“I support the Healy Pub proposal because I believe it will create the student-centric space in the heart of our campus that Georgetown so badly needs,” Sticka wrote in an email. “This great space will also have the added benefit of bringing student life back on campus, where it belongs and where it leads to fewer conflicts with our neighbors.”
An accompanying letter to the proposal, signed by 41 Georgetown alumni, advocates for the pub’s comeback.
Lufkin stressed the importance of this type of alumni engagement.
“SAFE has not only been funded by current undergraduates, but also by a number of past years and classes. This project has the unique ability to engage the campus as well as the alumni community,” he said. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime [opportunity] we can’t afford to pass up.”
Students also stressed the sentimental legacy that the pub has inspired in alumni and its potential as a social space.
“I’ve heard a lot of people talk about their parents who remember hanging out in the pub when they were at Georgetown, and it seems really unfortunate that we don’t get to experience that,” Caitlin Green (MSB ’14) said.
Although they do not officially endorse this proposal, GUSA President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) and Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) have added their signatures to the Healy Pub proposal and will take a closer look at its feasibility in the coming weeks.
“We’re interested in exploring the idea of a Healy pub, especially as a hub for student socializing,” Laverriere said. “Though still in idea form, we imagine this pub as a way to bolster student life on campus, safety in the community, and interaction between students and professors.”

Georgetown students’ avid Sporcling has landed the university a spot in the top 25 colleges that use the popular quiz website.
This week, Georgetown made it up to no. 22 in Sporcle’s college rankings, and many students say getting their fix is a favorite pastime.
Cole MacKenzie (COL ’14) spends an hour a day on average combing the website to get his “daily dose” of the available quizzes. Although he does not consider it to be an addiction, he does recognize that he is an avid “Sporcler.”
“Anyone that hasn’t been on Sporcle should really check it out,” he said.
MacKenzie said that he primarily uses Sporcle to track his mental ability in an amusing way while taking study breaks over the course of the school day.
The website provides quick timed quizzes about a variety of subjects. Universities are ranked based on a logarithmic formula that takes into account the number of visits per user, number of games played, number of page views and average time spent on the site.
The Georgetown student body has yet to see their professors use Sporcle as an element in their curriculum.
However, Rachel Grocock (SFS ’14), another frequent Sporcle user, said she believes that the website has academic benefits. It is particularly useful for the Map of the Modern World course, which requires all freshman students in the School of Foreign Service to memorize the location and capital of every country in the world.
“Occasionally I use the geography-specific section to study for Map of the Modern World,” Grocock said.
The website was founded in 2007 by Matt Ramme, who was both hooked on trivia and unimpressed by existing trivia websites.
According to Sporcle Vice President of Products Derek Pharr, the site is unique in that it is a direct reflection of what its audience wants.
“A lot of what you see on Sporcle today is from feedback a day ago, a month ago or a year ago. It helps shape the direction the website takes,” Pharr said. “We have a dedicated and excited team.”
Undergraduates represent an important part of that audience, according to Pharr.
“Sporcle has a broad audience, but the college population is definitely a big part of the website,” he said. “We hope it continues to be something we can tap into and extend upon.”
The company, which has apps compatible with both iPhone and Android, recently added a March Madness quiz section, with a nod to many college students’ fandom.
Sporcle is also looking into a way to organize their statistics so as to rank schools according to ability or speed in the future, which might change the composition of the top 25.

Mounting community opposition to the 2010 Campus Plan gained a new ally on March 17, when D.C. Councilmember Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3) declared her intention to testify against the proposal.
Cheh made the announcement at a Foxhall Community Citizens Association meeting, after the FCCA unanimously voted against the plan. The D.C. Zoning Commission will hold hearings on the campus plan April 14.
Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) has also openly voiced opposition to the plan, but has said that he will not testify it in front of the commission. Evans’ Director of Communications Andrew Huff declined to elaborate on the reasoning behind this decision.
“Nothing else to add — the councilmember simply believes it is inappropriate,” Huff said.
Scott Stirrett (SFS ’13), president of DC Students Speak, said his group does not support Cheh’s decision to testify.
“Commission hearings are not something where [the] council should have political influence,” Stirrett said. “Cheh’s decision to testify creates an undue political distraction.”
Cheh’s Chief of Staff David Zvenyach said that the zoning commission is nonpartisan, but added that the councilmember’s decision to support the FCCA and other area residents against the campus plan is not unprecedented.
“Cheh has testified before the commission and before other bodies before on behalf of the community,” Zvenyach wrote in an email.
In a Feb. 10 letter to the University Vice President of Facilities and Student Housing Karen Frank, Cheh outlined her concerns over the plan, including the construction of a circular road to facilitate shuttle bus turnaround as well as the proposed increase in graduate student enrollment.
In the letter, Cheh requested demographic data for graduate students currently living near campus.
“Such additional details may help ease concerns of Foxhall residents who fear that the growth in graduate student enrollment will cause an influx of likely transient students into their neighborhood,” Cheh wrote.
Bob Avery, president of the FCCA, said he and Cheh had recently been given a tour of the campus by Georgetown officials.
“I think that was a significant turning point for Mary Cheh,” Avery said. “She looked at those roads and said ‘[the loop road] doesn’t make sense.'”
Vice President of Student Affairs Todd Olson appeared on a local WAMU radio show Monday and answered a call-in question about how the campus plan dealt with transportation.
“We have a shuttle bus system, our Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle bus system, that now carries over 2 million riders a year,” Olson said on the show. “We’re looking to build a loop road on our campus that would more effectively serve our needs and allow us to keep buses off of neighborhood streets. … We believe it not only makes sense for traffic movement, but also for sustainability.”
Avery, however, questioned the validity of this explanation.
“We don’t understand why Georgetown wants to raise all of these environmental issues,” Avery said. “You start thinking about hidden agendas and all those other things.”
Avery said he believes Burleith faces greater problems than Foxhall in terms of student resident behavior, but added that the FCCA is concerned that such issues could spill over into their own neighborhood.
“We are fearful of Foxhall becoming more like Burleith,” Avery said. “There is a tipping point when graduate students become the dominant culture, and that becomes a problem. It is important to emphasize that this is not anti-student,” Avery said.
Avery speculated that the FCCA influenced Cheh’s concept of how the Foxhall community is being affected.
“What Cheh feels now that she didn’t feel before is that Georgetown now is simply too big,” he said.
The Advisory Neighborhood Commission-2E passed a resolution Feb. 28 opposing the campus plan. ANC-3D, which includes Foxhall, approved a similar resolution March 2. Such resolutions are given “great weight” by the zoning commission, according to ANC 2E Chair Ron Lewis.

For Mariana Hernandez (COL ’14), attending Wednesday’s Muslim Students Association’s Ask It! (Anonymously) event helped dispel the confusion she had about Islam.
“I have a good friend who’s Muslim. I went to prayer with her last week and my mom kind of panicked,” Hernandez said. “I came to this meeting to learn more about Islam and erase stereotypes. I want to find out different perspectives to make my own judgments.”
Featuring a panel of three professors who answered anonymously submitted questions, the forum allowed for attendees to pitch sensitive, Islam-related questions in an academic setting.
“We wanted to provide a place for people to ask the questions that are consistently propagated about Islam. There are so many misconceptions and prejudices thrown about in official media sources and casual conversation,” said Noreen Shaikh (COL ’12), president of the Muslim Students Association and the main organizer of the event.
In the interest of open discussion, students were encouraged to ask questions anonymously before and at the start of the event.
“Anonymity is important so people can ask the questions they wouldn’t ask in class or to a Muslim friend,” Shaikh said. “There are topics that seem politically incorrect or insensitive. We felt anonymity was necessary to allow a blunt, candid discussion of Islam.”
The veil of anonymity provoked controversial questions on a range of topics encompassing Muslim attitudes toward Jews, the security of Muslims’ rights in the United States, the abuse of women and homosexuality.
According to Clare Wilde, professorial lecturer in the theology department, the evening exemplified how Georgetown can serve as a haven for open discussion and mutual understanding.
“Georgetown University has a great potential to serve as a majlis [or council] of sorts: a place of respectful encounter and engagement of individuals from a variety of backgrounds and experiences,” Wilde said.
Jonathan Brown, assistant professor of Islamic studies and Muslim-Christian understanding in the School of Foreign Service, and Paul Heck, associate professor in theology, also moderated the event.
The event drew students from a wide range of religious backgrounds. Nazhif Wan Yusoff (SFS ’12), a Muslim, attended because he wanted to see Islam discussed from an academic standpoint.
“I wanted to see what people have to say,” he said.
Colleen Creeden (COL ’14), sought a more personal perspective on the material she has been studying in her Introduction to Religious Thought course taught by Wilde.
“I want to hear more [of a] perspective from [Muslim] students about their everyday lives,” she said.
While Shaikh acknowledged that the panel of professors could not provide definitive answers to the students’ questions, she stressed that discourse on these sensitive Islam-related subjects helps to build a foundation of knowledge for complex issues.
“The opinions presented are samples from the gambit of scholarly opinion. I’m not trying to assert that these are definitive answers, but they are part of the discourse on Islam … There is no one answer,” she said.

Tired of looking at Georgetown’s transportation website every time he wanted to ride a GUTS bus, Chris Cronbaugh (COL ’12) decided to create an application to check arrival times.
Now with the new “Next GUTS” application, Android phone users can quickly view the Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle schedule. Cronbaugh’s free application tells users the next departure time of a GUTS bus from a specific location.  Stops featured by the application include Wisconsin Avenue, Rosslyn, the Law Center and Dupont.
Danielle Filipponi (MSB ’13) thinks the application will help students and professors alike.
“From my own personal experience during rush hour on Fridays, it’s difficult to coordinate making GUTS buses with making the Metro. This application will definitely help plan efficiently,” she said.
Released Monday night, the application can be downloaded from the Android Market, but it will only function on devices running Android 2.1 or higher.
“Since I started learning Java this semester, which is the language that Android applications are written with, I decided that I could easily create an application that determines the amount of time that I have left before the next bus leaves,” Cronbaugh wrote in an email.
Cronbaugh pre-released the application on Facebook for about a week and a half before the official release, and reported positive feedback from students using the application.
“I believe that this application will help Georgetown students, staff and visitors make better use of the GUTS buses by more easily being able to access the schedules that they run on,” Cronbaugh said.
“It beats having to search for the GUTS bus website on your smartphone” Felicia Charles (COL ’12) said.
Other students think that it would be more helpful if the application were available on other smartphones.
“I wish he would make an app for the BlackBerry,” Henry Jennings (MSB ’13) said.
Cronbaugh has received requests to create an iOS version of the application that is compatible with iPhones and said that he is in the process of developing it. He does not have an estimated completion date at this time.

In the quest to receive an offer of admission from one of the nation’s elite colleges, some students rack up bills paying for high-price counselors to aid them in writing the perfect essay, while others feel left behind.  One new website, The Essay Exchange, hopes to level the playing field.
Launched in August 2010 by co-creators and founders Aaron Michel, Rory O’Connor and Paris Wallace, the site allows high school students to peruse the essays of hundreds of college students after paying a small fee. High school students pay $10 for each essay they view or $20 for all of the essays submitted by one college student.
The site advertises application essays for 25 of the nation’s most prestigious universities, including all members of the Ivy League, Georgetown University, Duke University and the University of Virginia.
The founders of The Essay Exchange believe the website represents a more democratic, equal-opportunity approach to the college process. Some critics believe that high school students from wealthy families have an advantage during the application process because they can afford to pay for expensive test preparatory programs and college guides. By offering a less expensive alternative to private counselors, The Essay Exchange hopes to make the process fairer.
“We think that if we can create a platform that could provide personalized guidance to applicants, for way cheaper than $3,700 [the average rate students pay for a private counselor], we can do a few things,” O’Connor said.
“We can build a pretty successful company, but also important to what we’re trying to do is we can help a lot of applicants, people that wouldn’t normally have to chance to get help with their application.”
The founders also emphasized the increased transparency The Essay Exchange can provide to the college application essay process.
“Everyone knows you need good grades in your classes and good standardized test scores to get into a good school. But on the application and essay side of things it’s not as clear [what admission offices look for],” O’Connor said. “Just from a transparency perspective, The Essay Exchange helps people learn what works.”
The Essay Exchange website has had approximately 20,000 site hits since its publication in August 2010 with about 800 college and high school student users. College students and recent graduates have uploaded over 750 essays to the site. Each contributor receives $2 every time his or her essay is read.
Yet not everyone in the college application game is a fan of the electronic resource. Margaret Lysy, an associate director of Georgetown’s Office of Undergraduate Admissions, said she finds the idea behind The Essay Exchange concerning.
“Georgetown’s admissions process is holistic and our required essays are an important piece of the puzzle in getting to know an applicant,” she wrote in an email.  “The best essays are truthful, reflective and do not try to fit a mold. Mining a website of successful essays will not help a student find his/her unique voice and could lead an applicant down a road of temptation to plagiarize and misrepresent.”
She advised that applicants work with their school guidance counselors or teachers to review their college application essays, as opposed to using a website or a private consultant.
Alexandria San Jose (COL ’14) agreed that writing the college application essay should be a personal experience.
“It seemed to me when I was writing essays that there were so many of a certain type,” she said, “so I tried make mine not so similar to all of the ones they already get, and to write mine in my own voice. And I think that the website might not help people do that.”
She added that the personal attention given to each application allows those who work in admissions to note incongruities in applications, such as a disparity between one’s English grades and the quality of the essay they submit.
Some are concerned that the website might encourage plagiarism. The Georgetown Office of Admissions currently does not have a specific method in place to check applicant’s essays for plagiarism. O’Connor said that the company has reached out to over 100 college admissions departments and given them access to the website’s database should they wish to run the essays of their applicants through.
