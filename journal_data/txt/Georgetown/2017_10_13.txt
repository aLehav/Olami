A proposal advocating that the women’s and gender studies program gain department status by fall 2018 was submitted Tuesday by students hoping to expand the program’s resources.
The student-led proposal, presented to Georgetown College Dean Chris Celenza, has the support of program faculty, the Georgetown University Student Association and 40 students and alumni as of press time.
Becoming a department would allow members of the program’s faculty to pursue tenure, which could also provide opportunities for student research. Advocates also hope the program would obtain more funding and resources as a department.
In addition to the establishment of the department, the proposal requests two full-time tenure-track positions, two to three additional full-time, nontenure-track faculty positions and a five-year dual enrollment Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts program.
Currently, none of the professors in the women’s and gender studies program, founded in 1987, are tenured or on the tenure track. Two of the 12 faculty members are full-time, including the program director, You Me Park. The remaining 10 professors in the department are part-time.
Students, including some majoring and minoring in the program, submitted the proposal, which highlighted recent difficulties faced by the program because of its non-department status, including providing resources for women’s and gender studies major students and meeting the demand for lower-level introductory courses. The students also argued they have a significant interest in the creation of a more robust academic space to explore the dynamics of gender and sexuality.
Celenza met Tuesday with Sierra Campbell (COL ’18), who has led the development of the proposal over the past month, to discuss the proposal and next steps.
“In the coming weeks, our team will be meeting with them, reviewing the proposal, and convening faculty to discuss the ways in which we — by which I mean faculty and students together — might go forward,” Celenza wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Campbell said the first meeting between College administrators and team members was largely positive, but finding a source of funding for the prospective department remains an obstacle.
“It was really productive and the dean seemed really optimistic about making it possible,” Campbell said. “The biggest barrier would be finding the money.”
Students can either major or minor in women’s and gender studies. However, majors who are double majoring in another discipline note the disparity between resources available for full departments compared to non-department programs such as the women’s and gender studies program.
A key issue for the program is the ability to meet student demand for introductory level courses. Many women’s and gender studies courses fulfill Georgetown’s “engaging diversity” requirements, making introductory-level classes popular.
However, with limited department resources, it is difficult to meet student demand for the program’s 11 currently offered courses, according to Park, who has been at Georgetown for 14 years.
Students decided to draft the proposal in part after Georgetown University’s Sexual Assault and Misconduct Task Force called for more academic resources exploring issues of sexual misconduct, Campbell said.
Kory Stuer (COL ’19), one of the students involved in drafting the proposal who is minoring in women’s and gender studies, said the establishment of a department would help address sexism on campus.
“There is still a huge problem of misogyny and sexism on this campus and I think to pretend that away is a gross injustice to the women and femmes on this campus,” Stuer said. “To show that there is an academic focus on studying feminism, on studying gender, on studying women is a really important step towards institutionally recognizing that that needs to change.”
The student team worked with the GUSA Academic Affairs policy coalition to draft the proposal starting Sept. 14.
Sara Clark (COL ’19), chair of the Academic Affairs policy coalition, said the student demand on campus for this program should not be ignored.
“The proposal demonstrates a clear student need for increased course offerings and faculty positions that could best be satisfied if the program were to become a department,” Clark said.
Within the past few weeks, the team has met with administrators in the Office of the Provost’s Student Advisory Committee and Celenza’s office.
Park said this is not the first time students and faculty have explored the possibility of a department. However, this effort is the first time a group of students have submitted a formal written proposal.
“I’m absolutely, of course, supporting students’ effort and I am really grateful,” Park said. “It was entirely student-led.”

What about spending money on a new department focused on the Height and Weight Studies? WE NEED MORE DEPARTMENTS. WE NEED MORE RIDICULOUSNESS

This is an important move to support the academic integrity of Georgetown. When compared to our peer institutions and the local state universities in the area, Georgetown is lagging behind in this area. Only by securing tenure lines can we attract and retain the talent needed to build on this robust program.

That exists. It’s part of basic medical training at the Med Center.

UPDATE (12/5): The U.S. Senate confirmed Kirstjen Nielsen (SFS ’94) to lead the Department of Homeland Security by a 62-37 vote Tuesday evening. Full story to come.
School of Foreign Service alumna Kirstjen Nielsen (SFS ’94) was nominated to lead the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday.
Nielsen was a longtime official in the Department of Homeland Security; she has served as a White House deputy chief of staff under former Secretary of Homeland Security and current White House Chief of Staff John Kelly (GRD ’84) since he left the department July 31. Nielsen followed Kelly to the White House. If confirmed, she would replace acting secretary Elaine Duke.
A Virginia native, Nielsen attended the University of Virginia School of Law after graduating from Georgetown. If confirmed, she would be the first former employee of the DHS to lead the department since its formation in 2002.
In a Thursday press conference announcing Nielsen’s nomination, President Donald Trump said she has demonstrated wisdom and leadership in her roles at the DHS and the White House.
“During John Kelly’s time at DHS, right by his side was [Nielsen], the chief of staff for the department. He would be the first to tell you that she was critical to his success,” Trump said. “There, she quickly reinforced a sterling reputation as a dedicated leader whose number-one priority is always the safety and security of our country and our citizens, not politics or ideology.”
Anthony Clark Arend, SFS senior associate dean of faculty and graduate affairs, congratulated Nielsen, his former student, on her nomination.
“I am excited to see that my former student Kirstjen Nielsen has been nominated to be Secretary of DHS,” Arend wrote in an email to The Hoya. “She was a student in my Constitutional Law of United States Foreign Relations class in the spring of 1994. This was obviously before DHS was created — but the class covered a number of subjects that relate to the work that DHS handles today.”
Nielsen is known to associates as a “no-nonsense player and a policy wonk,” though her “regimented style” has frustrated some senior White House officials accustomed to a freewheeling environment, The New York Times reported Wednesday.
Nielsen said serving as DHS secretary would be the “highest honor” of her life at the press conference Thursday.
“Since the department’s creation, I witnessed and continue to witness the dedication of these men and women, their professionalism, and their unwavering resolve to protect the nation.” Nielsen said. “I share the President’s profound commitment to the security of our country and the safety of the American people.”

Georgetown sent the second-most graduates to work for education nonprofit Teach for America in 2017 among similarly sized universities.
Twenty-six Georgetown graduates joined the TFA teaching corps, a body of students recruited to teach in low-income schools across the country for at least two years. The university tied for second place among medium-sized schools — between 3,000 and 9,999 undergraduates — with Boston College and neighboring Howard University. Emory University sent the largest cohort: 34 students.
The organization’s mission, according to Georgetown TFA recruitment director Deanna Lockey, is to pair teachers from underprivileged backgrounds with students in low-income K–12 schools.
“We’re looking for people to, first of all and most importantly, believe that all kids can learn and that they want to do whatever it takes to expand opportunities for students in low-income communities,” Lockey said.
Many recently recruited TFA teachers are among the first generation of their family to attend college and were taught by TFA staff when they attended elementary, middle or high school, Lockey said.
Since the organization’s inception in 1989, about 600 students from Georgetown have become TFA corps members, according to Lockey. Ten out of the 26 incoming teachers from Georgetown identified as non-white, while nationally about half of all corps members identify as non-white.
TFA corps members go on to teach anything from U.S. history to science in 53 regions spanning the continental United States and Hawaii. They arrive in environments often marred by high rates of attrition.
Eric Scheetz (SFS ’17), who teaches 10th-grade English, joined a Philadelphia classroom that had gone through two different teachers in one school year.
“They’re immediately hesitant of anyone who comes in the door — they think I’m going to quit,” Scheetz said. “I have incredibly smart kids but oftentimes they either have been told that they don’t know how to work or they find a lot of creativity drain out of them.”
Chris Fisk (COL ’17), who teaches 9th-grade English and Advanced Placement Human Geography in Miami, said part of what drew him to TFA was the ability to give back to the community where he grew up.
“[My Georgetown education] afforded me a deeper understanding of the fact that I not only had the ability to make decisions to better my own life, but also the ability to positively affect the lives of others,” Fisk wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It goes without saying that any opportunity to show another generation of students what that feels like, what that means for their lives, what that means for their families, and what that could mean for others, was certainly worth pursuing.”
Prior to establishing these teacher-student relationships, prospective corps members must complete an extensive recruitment process replete with information sessions, applications and interviews. To help students navigate the process, TFA has designated Lockey as an adviser and mentor for applicants.
“There are so many students who are interested in social impact work, but don’t necessarily know the best place for them in that work,” Lockey said. “I sit down with students one-on-one and help them realize whether or not their leadership opportunities that they have experienced both on campus and off campus are relevant.”
Since Georgetown does not offer an education major, students turn to extracurriculars to showcase their passion for education and social impact, Lockey said.
“They might be involved with New Student Orientation or residence housing or [Georgetown University Student Association] or Innovo Consulting,” Lockey said. “I think there are so many opportunities at Georgetown for students to gain leadership skills and we’re looking for that strong achievement, but it doesn’t have to just be academic or professional.”
The College currently has a minor in Education, Inquiry and Justice, a six-course program that offers classes such as “Theatre, Writing, Community” and “Educating the Whole Child.” Students in other schools cannot pursue the minor, but they can take some of the classes.
Despite being in the School of Foreign Service, Scheetz took courses to develop his passion for education equity and policy through the Alpha Phi Omega service fraternity and the Alternative Breaks Program, run out of the Center for Social Justice.
“I think there should be an SFS certificate equivalent,” Scheetz said. “This is the first year of the Educational Transformation Masters program at Georgetown, and so as that becomes established, if some of those courses became available to undergraduates that would be great.”
After being admitted into the teaching corps, students can then rank their regional preferences. To help narrow down the list, TFA provides a spreadsheet that lists each region and its lifestyle markers, such as transportation access, average monthly rent and certification costs.
The document also includes other identity-based considerations, such as support groups for LGBTQ individuals and work eligibility for teachers without documentation who benefit from the discontinued Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
Rio Djiwandana (COL ’16), who is a DACA recipient and teaches 8th-grade mathematics and special education classes in New York City’s Bronx borough, said TFA’s robust resource network is unlike any other.
“As a ‘DACAmented’ corps member, TFA provided me with legal assistance, additional financial support and extensive community-building opportunities that would not have been available to me elsewhere,” Djiwandana said.
Nevertheless, in a university where 40 percent of 2016 graduates went into financial services or consulting, choosing the teaching route may seem unusual. There is a negative stereotype that TFA is a fallback for unsuccessful consulting recruits.
Djiwandana, Scheetz and Fisk disagree. The demanding nature of the job, they say, requires commitment and authenticity.
“I’m pretty sure we all had other options, but this was where our passions led us,” Fisk wrote. “Now a few months in, I can confidently say this is not a job or a lifestyle that you just pursue as a backup plan — you have to really want it.”

The black population in Washington, D.C., dipped below 50 percent for the first time in nearly 60 years due to increased gentrification, growing income inequality and an expanding education gap, trends expected to continue without government intervention, according to a Georgetown University report released Thursday morning.
Requested by the D.C. Commission on African-American Affairs and led by Georgetown University associate professor of history and African-American studies Maurice Jackson, the report finds the main reason for black residents leaving Washington to be economic. The report uses analysis of the District’s economic data to evaluate and outline inequalities in income and wealth in D.C.
White households in D.C. have a net worth 81 times greater than black households: $284,000 versus $3,500. 
The 2016 D.C. unemployment rate for black people was 13.4 percent, compared to a rate of 2 percent for white people.
The lack of available jobs, skills training and a lag in educational attainment are all key factors preventing black residents in the District from finding the income necessary to remain in the city, according to the report.
In addition to the recommendations for improving the economic status of black residents of the District, the report recommended ways to limit the physical displacement that is occurring as a result of economic and racial disparities. 
The district has been losing black residents since the 1990s, during which D.C. lost 28,000 black residents, many of whom had been living in predominately low-income neighborhoods. These demographic changes linked to gentrification as a result of racial economic disparities by several studies.
The policy report concluded with a sobering takeaway for the city and its government.
“Growing inequalities are endangering the African American community,” the report stated. “More must be done to enhance the employment qualifications of and opportunities for low to moderate income African American residents.”
Jackson, who served as chair of the report and chair of the Commission on African American Affairs, said this issue is important to all members of the D.C. community. 
“This is an issue that affects the entire city population,” Jackson said at the report’s presentation at the District government’s headquarters in the John A. Wilson Building Thursday morning. “We must all do more to halt the flow of blacks out of this city, and to make life better for those who can stay.”
D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D-At Large) said that education is one of the major keys to addressing economic and racial inequality.
“The great equalizer in our society is education,” Mendelson said. “The council very much values the importance of public education, but we haven’t figured out how to crack that nut and make that change fast enough,” Mendelson said.
The report outlines a series of tangible policy actions for the District government to combat the economic and housing trends in D.C.
To stimulate economic development for black individuals in the city, the proposal recommends increasing funding for existing workforce development programs, partnering with growing industries and developing more private-public partnerships to create more jobs.
Councilmember Elissa Silverman (I-At Large) said Project Empowerment, a workforce development program, allows residents to go through three weeks of workforce job readiness and then are placed in a subsidized employment program for up to six months.
The apprenticeship programs recommended by the report also garnered special attention from the councilmembers at the proposal unveiling Thursday. 
 “What we hear from a lot of our job seekers is that they can’t sit for weeks and weeks in a training program. They need to earn income … and the great thing about apprenticeships is, it’s on the job training while you earn money,” Silverman said. 
D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (I-At Large) said these problems are long-standing.  Mendelson said 60 percent of new jobs in D.C. will require training beyond the high school level, but 50 percent of black D.C. residents have no forms of tertiary education.
To combat these changes in housing and living trends, the Georgetown research team made  another series of policy recommendations for the local government. The recommendations included investment in multiple levels of accessible housing, the creation of a database for affordable housing, the strengthening of penalties for unfair landlords and increased clarity in use of federal housing funds.
The report noted that the preservation of black housing should be viewed as the prevention of the pricing of “culture and humanity out of the city.”
Using the actions the report recommends, the Georgetown research team hopes that the government will create more low-income housing opportunities in order to support less wealthy individuals before neighborhoods experience an influx of younger and better educated residents.

Look at the map. The District of Columbia is surrounded by Maryland and Virginia where all population groups are and have been growing. I see transportation improvement rather than placement of a major ethnic demographic group as the key policy action imperative
[…] black residents disproportionately bearing the burden of low wages and often facing the effects of gentrification. Seattle is also one of the metro areas with the fastest-growing income inequality in the […]

Washington, D.C. residents will soon be able to access the recently renovated area of the Southwest Waterfront by way of expanded transportation options, including a southwest shuttle and a water taxi, Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) announced Thursday.
Increased transportation options will allow residents to access the area’s newest development: the recently opened District Wharf. A mile-long stretch of residential and commercial developments along the southwest side of the Potomac River, the District Wharf includes restaurants, bars, office spaces and housing, as well as a recent addition to the public transport network that traverses the city.
The city is also working to make this area more accessible with both public and private supplements to the current public transit network. A privately operated water taxi currently links the Wharf with Georgetown and Alexandria and will add the National Harbor in Maryland to its route in the coming months.
Nearby Metrorail Green and Yellow line stations at L’Enfant Plaza, Metrobus stops, bike share docks and free shuttle buses aim to make traveling to and from Southwest D.C. easier and cheaper, according to the District Wharf’s Transportation guidelines. 
“We are proud and eager to celebrate The Wharf’s incredible transformation, so today we are highlighting the exciting new transportation options that will be available to residents and visitors,” Bowser wrote in a Thursday news release. “We know that – particularly during opening week – thousands of people will be visiting The Wharf each day, so we are urging people to learn about the many ways to get to and from The Wharf and to plan ahead.”
This expansion and renovation is consistent with Bowser’s 2015 initiative to use $155 million of foreign investments to create affordable housing and employment opportunities for D.C. residents. The Warf received $100 million of this sum for construction. 
The project is responsible for 215 affordable housing units and 1,000 new permanent service jobs, according to an Oct. 10 news release from the mayor’s office. 
The Wharf is expected to produce nearly 6,000 permanent jobs and provide $94 million in direct annual tax revenue to the District, with D.C. locals expected to take 51 percent of the jobs. The remaining vacancies will be filled with residents from the broader D.C.-Maryland-Virginia area. 
Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development Brian Kenner said the development advances the District’s economic growth.
“The development team shared the District’s common goals of making The Wharf a world-class destination as well as an engine of economic opportunity for District residents,” Kenner wrote in an Oct. 12 news release.
Caroline McDonald (SFS ’20), a Maryland native who regularly uses the Metro to go home and see her family, said any expansion of the District’s public transportation network is an asset to the city. 
“Driving in D.C. is just impossible, so [the new options] open it up to people from the suburbs as well. People traveling around, people visiting, pretty easy to navigate, unless you get on the wrong line,” McDonald said. “The more you can expand it, the better, because now we don’t travel around as much as Georgetown students, probably not as much as we should.” 
Twenty thousand people are expected to attend the kickoff events  over four days celebrating the opening of the Wharf, which will include fireworks, free live music and restaurant openings. 
“With the opening of The Wharf, we are breathing new life into the Southwest Waterfront and giving residents and visitors an exciting new place to enjoy local D.C.,” Bowser said in a news release on Oct. 12.

Georgetown University’s D.C. Reads program will celebrate 20 years of tutoring, mentoring and advocating for education in Washington, D.C.’s most underprivileged school districts Oct. 20.
The university’s Center for Social Justice launched the program in 1997 in response to Congress’s passing of the America Reads Challenge Act, a law intended to improve literacy in elementary schools across the country and engage college students in volunteer and federal work-study programs, that same year. Local chapters on college campuses formed in response. 
The Georgetown chapter works with elementary school students in Ward 7 schools who are one month to 2.5 years behind their peers in their literacy skills.
According to the 2010 census, the median annual income in Ward 7 was of $58,068 — almost four times less than the $215,530 of Ward 2, where Georgetown is located.
 “Our experience in D.C. is not the typical experience,” D.C. Reads Coordinator Genevieve Pool (SFS ’19) said. 
96 percent of Ward 7’s residents are black, a demographic group disproportionately disadvantaged in education access. A 2014 study by the American Civil Liberties Union revealed that school disciplinary policies disproportionately affect black students, as they are three times more likely to be arrested than white students. Black students represent 31 percent of school-related arrests despite being only one-sixth of the public school population.
The study noted that being punished at school resulted in an increased likelihood of future incarceration. Students suspended or expelled from school for a discretionary violation are nearly three times more likely to be in contact with the juvenile justice system in the following year. 
D.C. Reads Program Director Sabrina Sifuentes said that helping at-risk students early in their education can prevent them from these hazards.
“Education is the equalizer, and I knew I needed to work in these specific communities in these specific schools. I really see it is as a privilege that our students allow us to get to know them and help them through this journey,” Sifuentes said. 
D.C. Reads tutors’ personalized attention provides a change of pace to Ward 7 students who typically learn in overcrowded and understaffed classrooms. 
“Students are paired with a tutor one on one for the entire semester, which is really nice because they get attached and get to see that role model in college,” Pool said. 
Georgetown students commit to volunteering twice a week for the program at one of the eight tutoring sites in Ward 7, developing a strong relationship with their tutee. Many tutors appreciate the bonds they form with their tutees.
“My favorite part was definitely developing a relationship with my mentee because it is easy to go in with a savior complex and just not make any real connections, but the fact that we had the same child to mentor every week allowed me to actually get to know them,” former D.C. Reads Tutor Natalia Campos Vargas (SFS ’19) said. 
Throughout its two-decade long existence, the D.C. Reads program has undergone changes. A few years ago, tutors were able to design lesson plans for their tutees as they saw fit. Today, the program has moved to a more structured system which, Sifuentes said, allowed the program to better gauge the tutees’ academic progress. 
“The biggest success we can have is when we no longer need to work with a student. As much as that can be painful, letting them go when they are on level allows us to work with other students who need help,” Sifuentes said. 
The twentieth anniversary celebration, which caps off the CSJ’s Education Week, will be held in the Arrupe multipurpose room. The celebration will host community members from each of the eight teaching sites in Ward 7, as well as Georgetown alumni, former tutees and principals of schools affiliated with the program.
Georgetown students are welcome to attend the event to learn more about becoming involved with the program.
“It’s a great way of giving back to the D.C. community, which can be easily ignored from inside the front gates,” Campos said.

A bill to decriminalize sex work in Washington, D.C., and improve public health standards and safety through a “human rights approach” to the industry is awaiting committee review following Councilmember David Grosso’s (I-At Large) introduction of the bill Oct. 5.
The Reducing Criminalization to Improve Community Health & Safety Amendment Act of 2017, introduced by Grosso who partnered with the Sex Workers Advocates Coalition to craft the bill, and cosponsored by Councilmember Robert C. White Jr. (D-At Large, laid out clear objectives to counter the stigma associated with sex work.
The proposed bill repeals a number of laws and parts of laws that criminalize adults for exchanging sex for money or other items of value, Grosso said. 
“The reason I want to do it, in a nutshell, is I do not think the criminalization of sex workers has worked for the District of Columbia,” Grosso said in an interview with DCist Oct. 5. “Arresting our way out of the problem is not the solution.”
 The Sex Workers Advocates Coalition is made up of different organizations including HIPS, a group designated to promote the health of and advocate for those impacted by sexual work or drug use. 
Johanna Margeson, legal and advocacy fellow at HIPS, said the group takes a holistic approach to communities where sexual work is prevalent.
“The coalition began in October 2016 and is rooted in a fact-based, harm reduction framework that takes a holistic, intersectional view in its activities and centers marginalized communities,” Margeson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The American Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia was also a member of the Sex Workers Advocates Coalition that supported the bill. 
ACLU of D.C. Executive Director Monica Hopkins-Maxwell said criminalization of sex work exploits the most vulnerable D.C. residents.
“Criminalization has placed vulnerable D.C. residents at greater risk of violence, police harassment, and exposure to exploitation,” Hopkins-Maxwell wrote in a statement on the ACLU of DC website. “It has led to a cycle of violence, poverty, and incarceration that only creates additional barriers to more traditional employment for those engaging in survival sex work.”
Supporters claim this bill will help sex workers who experience violence resulting from their work, and especially those who are also members of underrepresented populations. 
“Research shows that over 80 percent of street-based sex workers experience violence in the course of their work,” Margeson said. “Criminalization of sex work has a greater negative impact on groups already facing discrimination, including communities of color, gay and trans people, people with disabilities, immigrants, and people with criminal convictions. 
Margeson said the bill will alleviate some of the factors affecting underrepresented groups.
 “This bill is a step in the right direction because it alleviates some of the barriers people face, however, there is still a need for housing, job opportunities and basic needs,” Margeson said.
The bill is also intended to help combat sexual exploitation and will not affect the restrictions on minors involved in sex trade.
“The bill does not change any of our laws regarding coercion or exploitation, which will continue to be prohibited,” Grosso wrote in his statement. “Sex workers themselves are often some of the best-positioned people to identify and help people in situations of exploitation, and by removing the criminal sanctions on them, we can improve our efforts on that front.” 
However, the bill faces opposition from conservative groups. Washington Times senior correspondent Deborah Simmons cautioned against the legalization of sex work in an editorial published by the Times on Monday.
“There must be sturdy longitudinal evidence that legal prostitution will fix or enhance problems already on the front burner, and be inclusive across the racial and socioeconomic spectrum before councilmembers propose and vote on such a bill,” Simmons said.
Pushback is expected, according to Margeson.
“Some people have expressed their concerns with the bill or have proposed different models,” Margeson said. “Ideally, we would love for a hearing in the spring so that the bill can go to a vote. A hearing will also allow those who have questions about the bill to ask them.”
Decriminalizing sex work would help sex workers access resources like healthcare and law enforcement when needed, H*yas For Choice Co-President Annie Mason (COL ’18) said. 
Mason said the organization will be introducing more advocacy efforts on behalf of sex workers. 
“And it’s something that we’re actually very conscious of, especially this year, and now, with the introduction of this bill, we will be ramping up our advocacy towards sex workers’ rights,” Mason said.

The Office of the Chief Information Officer presented its forthcoming centralized information portal, Georgetown360, which will be rolled out at the end of the month for the School of Nursing and Health Studies.
The new portal, Hoya360, will integrate all current sources of club and academic information for Georgetown students in one location. A version of the portal has already been implemented for faculty, while a version for alumni will be formally launched with the student portal by the end of the month, according to the platform website.
Currently, Georgetown utilizes a variety of different systems and websites for students to access information, including MyAccess, Blackboard, Canvas, and the Georgetown University website. With the implementation of Hoya360, some of those services may be gradually retired.
Vice President for Information Technology and Chief Information Officer Judd Nicholson said the idea for a new system arose from two areas: a desire to revamp the alumni relationship network and student-voiced concerns about locating information. 
“When you become an alumni, we want to talk to you and have conversations with you that’s representative of your experience at Georgetown, and we did get a lot of complaints from students about not being able to find things, not knowing who to go to,” Nicholson said. “Those two ideas, those two issues, really converged together.” 
Nicholson said the rollout will begin with NHS students because its population is a model of the greater school community. 
Nicholson said the larger hopes for this initiative include introducing Hoya360 in the School of Continuing Studies, the Georgetown University Law Center, the Georgetown University Medical Center and the other graduate programs, as well as creating a portal for parents to access important information.
While the idea for Hoya360 emerged about five years ago, it only began to take shape two years ago, with the design process beginning last year. The portal itself is based on Salesforce, a widely-used customer relationship management software. 
Many student groups contributed to the project, including the Georgetown University Student Association’s Student Technology Advisory Board and the NHS Academic Council.
Senior Assistant Dean in the NHS Doug Little said the initiative is a community effort. 
Both Nicholson and Little emphasized the fluid nature of the platform; after the initial implementation, there will be continual updates and new features every few months. 
“Part of the beauty of this platform is we’re able to continue to iterate and make it better,” Nicholson said. 
In addition to function, the development of Hoya360 also focused on the site’s aesthetic, keeping in mind the desires and expectations of its target audience. Student input was brought in from the beginning and it has helped focus the platform on the user experience and make it unique.
One of the largest challenges throughout this project was the integration of older Georgetown technologies, such as MyAccess into the new portal. 
“There were a number of technical challenges, and it’s been a long process, so I think the other challenge I would say is keeping people engaged and excited and informed, and making sure we consider stakeholders’ input,” Nicholson said. 
The entire concept of Hoya360 represents a way that Georgetown is adapting and keeping up with the changing technological world and being responsive to student needs, according to Little.
“When you talk to alumni about what defined their time at Georgetown on the hilltop, they use the word home. We really wanted Hoya360 and the overall GU360 project to strengthen that sense of home while they were here for the four years on the hilltop, and then extend it to when they leave the hilltop,” Little said.

The year-old Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has overcome other multilateral development banks’ failures to adapt to the rise of emerging economies unlike established western financial institutions, AIIB Vice President of Policy and Strategy Joachim von Amsberg said in a Wednesday lecture.
Headquartered in Beijing, the AIIB is a development bank working to expand and build infrastructure in Asian-Pacific nations.
Von Amsberg, who formerly served as vice president of development finance at the World Bank, said long-standing multilateral development banks such as the World Bank have failed to reform their governance and structure to reflect the rise of emerging economies.
“It has been increasingly difficult to adjust the governance of existing institutions to that changing weight of economies in the world,” von Amsberg said at the lecture co-sponsored by the Asian Studies Program, the Georgetown Anti-Poverty Society, and the Master of Science in Foreign Service Program.
Von Amsberg also noted that some Western G-7 countries, which drove the creation of institutions like the World Bank and currently hold large amounts of their shares within them, are reluctant to give up their position and influence of leadership on these banks.
By contrast, only 25 percent of the AIIB’s shares are held by non-Asian countries. China holds 25 percent and the remaining 50 percent is owned by other Asian states, which make up the rest of the bank’s 80-country membership.
Von Amsberg said that, despite its significant position, China cannot act as a dominant player within the institution.
“Of course it’s very important that [China] is our largest shareholder,” von Amsberg said. “But it’s not dominant, and, in fact, it can always be outvoted by other shareholders, which I think is a very important part of the multinational governance.”
Von Amsberg said this distribution was the result of commitments from the AIIB to ensure true multinational governance and high-quality standards for investing, prompting Asian and European partners to join the bank in 2015 despite U.S. pressure. This downplayed earlier concerns over Chinese President Xi Jinping’s intentions to use the bank to undermine other MDBs’ influence.
“Of course, AIIB can and should be seen as a broader picture of China’s growing role in the world,” von Amsberg said. “China is complementing its bilateral investments, or direct loans, with a multilateral engagement, as most developed nations do.”
Von Amsberg said the bank is able to operate with a fraction of the World Bank’s staff by cooperating with consulting firms, academic institutions, government offices and other MDBs to develop its projects. AIIB’s billing sheet is about half the size of the World Bank’s, while its 120-member staff is less than one hundredth the size of the World Bank’s. Von Amsberg noted that the AIIB co-finances many World Bank projects and could not function without reciprocal assistance.
With the need for $93 trillion over the next 15 years for global infrastructure projects, von Amsberg said the AIIB is another part of the solution to solve the Infrastructure Investment Paradox — the phenomena where supply and demand for investment funds in the global market do not coincide.
AIIB is attempting to tackle the issue by committing to the creation of sustainable infrastructure projects that connect countries across international borders and to the mobilization of capital to meet the demand of emerging markets.
Von Amsberg said banks like his complement others, like the World Bank, in funding sustainable infrastructure projects.
“I’m not saying one model is better or worse. I’m saying we are consciously designing ourselves to complement the existing institutions rather than replicate them because we think that’s a more important way in which we can contribute,” von Amsberg said.

Washington, D.C.’s Housing Production Trust Fund invested $138.5 million in affordable housing in the 2017 fiscal year, supporting more than 1,900 housing units across the city.
This year, initiatives funded by the HPTF include acquiring and remodeling affordable housing units in the District, fueled by a $32 million increase in funding from the 2016 fiscal year. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) said housing issues remain a priority for her administration during the 2018 fiscal year.
“As our city continues to grow and prosper, my Administration will remain laser-focused on ensuring residents of all backgrounds and income levels have access to safe and affordable places to live in all eight wards,” Bowser wrote in an Oct. 2 news release.
Since 2015, the District has spent more than $276 million on HPTF financing, preserving more than 3,300 units that house approximately 7,200 residents.
In 2017, some of the largest affordable housing projects included the South Capitol Multifamily Building, which received $25 million for 78 affordable units; Takoma Place in Ward 4, which received $13.71 million to purchase a 105-unit building; and Hilltop Apartments in Ward 7, which received $12.92 million to preserve 18 affordable housing units.
Wards 1, 2 and 6 each received funding for one affordable housing project, while Ward 4 received funding for eight projects, Ward 5 received funding for two, Ward 7 received funding for four and 8 received funding for six.
D.C. Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) said the District City Council is committed to funding the HPTF and increasing affordable housing in the District.
“The District is really making enormous efforts to create as much affordable housing as we can, and that’s the highest amount we’ve spent in a long time, so we’re very supportive of that idea,” Evans said.
Evans added that the Council’s plan to address affordable housing moving forward is to continue allotting funds annually to create and explore options for housing all District residents.
“It’s more of the same,” Evans said. “The mayor’s going to put forth $100 million, which she’s committed to doing every year, and to fund and partner with various nonprofits and others to create and rehabilitate affordable housing,” Evans said.
The funding represents a step toward addressing homelessness in the District.
In January, the city’s homelessness rate was the highest in the nation among states, with 124 residents out of every 10,000 experiencing homelessness, according to the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
Claire Zippel, a policy analyst at the District Fiscal Policy Institute, said Bowser’s commitment to dedicating $100 million annually to affordable housing issues also demonstrates a commitment to solving the homelessness crisis in the District.
“The issues of homelessness and lack of affordable housing are integrally linked in the District and in cities across the country. We know that the best solution to homelessness is housing, and also that people who have stable, affordable housing are able to do better, be healthier and experience better well-being throughout all aspects of their lives,” Zippel said in an interview with The Hoya. “Being homeless and lacking affordable housing are linked to a lot of bad outcomes, especially for kids.”
Zippel also said the District has more work to do in terms of addressing housing that is not only more affordable in comparison to other District prices, but also affordable for middle and lower income District residents.
In addition to the Fund, the District must utilize other subsidy sources, such as rental assistance, in order to maximize its impact, Zippel said.
“Our biggest challenge in the deployment of the city’s affordable housing resources is the ability to serve the lowest income residents who are most likely to become homeless. If someone is paying 80 percent of their income for rent, even just a small unexpected expense like losing hours at work can put someone behind on their rent and at risk for eviction and homelessness,” Zippel said.
Evans also said the Council should continue to take a multi-faceted approach to homelessness by focusing on housing as well as funding for mental health and substance abuse issues.
“People are homeless for lots of reasons. They’re homeless because they’re down on their luck. They’re homeless because of substance abuse problems and alcohol problems, mental health problems,” Evans said. “Even if you do have housing for people to live in, sometimes they don’t want to live in housing. There’s a lot of issues that surround homelessness that go way beyond whether or not a unit is affordable.”
