For many prospective students descending on campus today, the Georgetown Admissions Ambassador Program weekends are more about connecting with Georgetown itself than with other accepted students.
The majority of students come to GAAP in an attempt to see if the academics are the right fit.
“I took it from a very academic perspective, especially when I came to GAAP, when I arrived, I was curious more about learning about what my time at Georgetown would be like from an academic purpose,” Pietro Bartoli (SFS ’17) said.
Due to this academic focus, making friends becomes a secondary concern.
“More than anything I think GAAP is for academics and just seeing the school, so I didn’t go into GAAP saying, ‘I’m going to make friends here,’” Eric Wu (SFS ’17) said. “It’s more of a way for students to find out whether or not they are compatible with the school as a whole rather than the specific people they find at GAAP weekend.”
The atmosphere of Georgetown’s campus and of Washington, D.C. is what most students base their decision off of, rather than the community of prospective students.
“GAAP’s what made up my mind. I wasn’t sure I wanted to come here,” Lauren Miller (SFS ’16) said.
Despite focus elsewhere, friendships still develop. Wu and Bartoli became roommates after meeting at GAAP.
“Honestly I have no complaints about GAAP; it did exactly what it was supposed to do. And there’s no such thing as orchestrated friendship building. You can’t really say that GAAP did this correctly in order to make you friends with this person. I think the way that [Pietro and I] became friends was very organic,” Wu said.
GAAP allows prospective students the opportunity to make friends mostly by noticing and befriending prospective students with similar interests. Sapir Yarden (SFS ’15) felt the weekend allowed her to befriend those she perceived as interesting or relatable, mentioning one of her friends.
“We kind of were in the same group. We did icebreakers together and he mentioned that he spoke like 12 different languages and I was like, ‘That kid seems awesome, I want to be friends with him,’” Yarden said.
In terms of the degree to which prospective students reflect the Georgetown community, many prospective students felt GAAP leaders and current students were a more accurate reflection of the community.
“It was nice to kind of get a vibe for the people, but I think I got a better vibe from the GAAP leaders than the kids in my group because I knew a lot of these kids aren’t going to come to Georgetown and I’m not necessarily going to be friends with all of these kids,” Bartoli said.
For students accepted early to Georgetown, some did not feel making friends was a focus throughout the weekend, as many prospective students were uncertain of their attendance.
“I was early action too so half the people I met weren’t planning on coming to Georgetown. …Maybe it was different for people who are regular decision but for early [action] those kids tended to get into really good schools so for me it didn’t really matter because a lot of them I was never going to see again,” Kate Schertz (NHS ’15) said.
Other students did not search for specific types of possible friends throughout the weekend, but rather the identity of the community as a whole.
“I think it’s a good way to get everyone together who has been accepted to kind of get that feeling I was talking about of trying to see who is going to school with you, the community that you would be going to school in,” Yuhao Shi (NHS ’15).
In the end, some students prefer GAAP the way it is, even without the focus on friendship building.
“I think GAAP works well the way it does now. I don’t think much should change about it. The focus shouldn’t be friendship building,” Bartoli said.

A bottle of André costs $4.99, and a Georgetown tank from the campus bookstore costs $20. The total price tag for Georgetown Day this year, however, is slightly more expensive, coming in at around $50,000.
The day of celebration on the last Friday of classes, this year April 25, generally involves students roaming the front lawn, but the Georgetown Day Planning Committee also prepares other activities to ensure all students can enjoy the day.
The $50,000 budget includes approximately $11,000 for security, $8,000 for food, $7,000 for performers, $9,000 for sound equipment, $6,000 for inflatables, $4,000 for giveaways, $2,000 for venues, $2,000 for combined food, t-shirts and small gifts for volunteers, $1,000 in other equipment and $1,000 for non-volunteer labor.
The high budget for security and other staff is generally necessary because of a low turnout in student volunteers.
“At the end of the day we have to hire a lot of help to run the day,” Georgetown Day Planning Committee Chair Andi DeBellis (MSB ’14) said. “Where we would normally rely on student volunteers, we have to rely on outside people and provide heavy incentives for students to volunteer. That is a large chunk of the cost.”
Volunteer recruitment  began with a mass email to students from the Center for Student Engagement and through Facebook advertising. This year, CSE staff set the goal of attracting 120 student volunteers, which they have almost met. Some Georgetown Day Planning Committee members attribute this to better incentives than in years past.
“Surprisingly, it has been easy to find volunteers because of the great incentives we have this year,” Georgetown Day Planning Committee member Natalia Peña (SFS ’17) said. “It is the first year we have a volunteer hospitality room where they will have food all day. … Volunteers will also get free shirts, and they get all of this just for volunteering for one two-hour shift.”
Georgetown Day has been a university tradition since 2000, after a student died in February because of injuries sustained in a fight with another student. A committee was quickly formed to plan an event in April to raise the morale of students and members of the Georgetown community. The day has since become a highly-anticipated end-of-semester event for students.
“Students really look forward to it, so there’s a lot of pressure,” DeBellis said.
The nine members of this year’s planning committee began brainstorming ideas for Georgetown Day in November 2013 and began executing logistics in January. Associate Director of the Center for Student Engagement Amanda Carlton, the main administrative advisor for Georgetown Day, meets regularly with the committee.
“As an advisor, I help to facilitate the proper university policy and processes. I also advise them with how much money there is, where the relevant university offices are, what contracts to get, and help to facilitate relationships across campus with faculty and staff,” Carlton said.
This advanced planning represents a shift from years past, in which students did not sign up for or pursue creating planning committees, which led to a scaled-back version of the campus holiday in 2012, without the inflatables or beer garden that had been customary in years past.
“Two years ago, Georgetown Day hit rock bottom where people weren’t willing to volunteer to take on planning it because they wanted to partake in the events of the day,” DeBellis said. “A major reset button was pressed.”
This year, the planning committee has worked to assuage professors’ concerns about low class attendance on Georgetown Day.
“We want everyone to enjoy the day and for professors to be able to do their job,” DeBellis said. “[Professors] were really in favor of us doing more night programming and that is how Georgetown Day got as expensive as it is now.”
The committee runs programming from 6 a.m. Friday morning to early Saturday morning. There is more emphasis this year on nighttime events, so as to not interfere with classes and other day events.
“We want to make sure this is a day for the entire Georgetown community,” Carlton said.
One way that committee members hope to increase class attendance is to provide a variety of activities on campus at nighttime, similar to last year’s program, allowing students to fully enjoy their Georgetown Day experience while not risking truancy. According to DeBellis, nighttime activities will include an ice cream social, a concert and a kegger for those over 21 years old.
However, these changes seem impractical to experienced Georgetown Day participants.
“I think attendance at those will be lower because after a day of drinking it’s hard to motivate yourself to go places in the evening,” Meg Beedle (COL ’14) said. “I think that it would be nice to have something to go to in the evening, but I have to say from past experience, it can be a challenge to rally after, and getting people to go places in the evening can be difficult.”
Despite not drinking, Grant Franco (MSB ’14) agreed that the nighttime activities are likely to be sparsely attended.
“Honestly I think it’s kind of silly because there’s a lot of people who drink a lot during the day so they probably don’t want to go and do stuff at night,” Franco said. “Personally, I think that’s fine, I love concerts and I love doing stuff like that, and I don’t drink, so I love that, but I know a lot of my friends take naps during the afternoon so I don’t know how many people would be into that.”

In a rare move, the D.C. Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration released four liquor licenses designated for Georgetown Thursday morning, leading to a scramble among area restaurants hoping to snatch up the rare permits.
The four licenses included a single, coveted tavern license, one of only six in Georgetown, which became available when the ABRA approved a license change for El Centro D.F. Mexican restaurant, at 1218 Wisconsin Ave. NW, from a tavern license to a restaurant license in February.
On Thursday afternoon, the tavern license was awarded to Smith Point, an exclusive area nightclub located at 1338 Wisconsin Ave. NW.
According to ABRA restrictions enacted in 1989 as per request by the Advisory Neighborhood Commission, there can be no more than 68 liquor licenses, including inactive licenses, in the Georgetown Moratorium Zone and Georgetown Historic District. This includes six nightclub or tavern licenses, the transfer of which is prohibited unless there are fewer than six such licensed establishments in the historic district.
“The purpose of the Georgetown Moratorium Zone is to place limits on the number of alcoholic beverage licenses that exist in Georgetown,” ABRA spokeswoman Jessie Cornelius said.
A tavern license differentiates from a liquor license in that it waves the requirement that an establishment generate at least 45 percent of its revenues from food sales alone.
“The original purpose of the moratorium was to strike a balance between bars, restaurants and retail,” ANC2E Commissioner Bill Starrels said.
However, the limited number of licenses has forced businesses who want to open new restaurants in Georgetown to purchase inactive licenses from restaurants that no longer want them on the secondary market at highly inflated prices, sometimes up to tens of thousands of dollars.
“They’re not supposed to be commodities,” said Starrels, whose district includes the entire Waterfront area and M Street up to 31st Street. “In other words, they’re supposed to be gotten from the city at a nonexpensive price. They should not be selling for tens of thousands of dollars to people — that’s wrong.”
In May 2010, ABRA attempted to combat the problem by releasing seven licenses that had been in safekeeping for a modest filing fee. However, of the seven businesses that attained the licenses, which were available on a first-come, first-served basis, three of the venues never opened. Of the other three, Puro Cafe at 1529 Wisconsin Ave. NW, has since closed, Zenobia Lounge at 1025 31st St. NW, shifted its license to an inactive status to avoid the restrictions that came with it, and Tackle Box, 3245 M St. NW, is facing eviction.
Plans are in the works for restrictions on releasing licenses to the first in line at ABRA’s 14th Street offices but are still in progress.
“Everybody wants to have these licenses put to work. We do not want a repeat of what just happened,” Starrels said.
The last establishment to be awarded a tavern license was Gypsy Sally’s, at 3401 K St. NW, in February. Karen Ensor, owner of Gypsy Sally’s, said that she wanted the license to relieve her business of the arduous bookkeeping involved in food sales.
“We certainly didn’t mind paying the extra license fee to be relieved of all those bookkeeping duties. And it certainly takes any pressure off you to make sure you’re selling enough food, which I know some restaurants struggle with,” Ensor said.
Although she does not advocate a lift of the moratorium, Ensor lamented the disappearing nightlife scene in Georgetown as a result of the moratorium’s restrictions.
“Georgetown has become a little bit too saturated, from my personal perspective, in retail stores, and I think Georgetown’s nightlife has suffered because of that, and it’s not quite the go-to place like it used to be when my husband and I were younger and where there was a vibrant music scene here,” Ensor said.
According to Starrels, however, Georgetown residents would prefer to see more new restaurants than nightclubs.
“People are not scared of restaurants. They want more restaurants. They just don’t want restaurants that become nightclubs late at night,” Starrels said. “Our demographic is such, we have a lot of new residents in Georgetown, a lot of those are in higher-end condos and whatnot and also young professionals living here, they don’t want to be kept up at night.”
The moratorium is currently in effect until February 2016. Information on the three other establishments that were awarded licenses today was not available at press time.

The Georgetown Club Hockey program celebrated its 75th anniversary this past weekend with its annual alumni game.
The anniversary celebration started Friday evening with an information session and a meet and greet, which introduced alumni to the current team. The magnitude of the program’s anniversary ensured that more alumni attended than in previous years. Recent graduates and older alumni who attended and participated in this weekend’s activities stressed the importance of alumni connections and Georgetown memories after graduation to current players.
In past years, the weekend focused on the alumni game, which usually only features recent graduates. This year, along with the current team and 20 recent graduates, 10 older alumni visited for the weekend. The oldest alumnus in attendance graduated in the class of 1968 and participated in the game as well.
On Saturday, the team and alumni convened at the Kettler Capitals Iceplex in Arlington, Va., to play multiple, shortened games. After the games, the current team’s season banquet, which the alumni attended as well, was held at F. Scott’s.
“It was easy to bond with the alumni, chatting with guys who went here in the ’70s and still sharing similar stories and memories,” Captain Connor Brogan (COL ’14) said.
Not only was the weekend fun for the current players, but the alumni cherished reminiscing at Georgetown.
“It was great seeing everyone, seeing that the camaraderie still exists, learning how the program has changed for the better,” program alumnus Gerard Fritz (COL ’85) said.
The reception at F. Scott’s focused on recognizing the current team, as the Atlantic Coast Collegiate Hockey League commissioner presented the champions’ cup to the team for the third consecutive year.
Apart from the many festivities, the weekend emphasized increasing alumni connections with the team, a focus familiar to many Georgetown student groups.
“The alumni network right now is not very strong. The goal this weekend was to try to create a more solid alumni network, where we can help kids who are trying to get internships and such, and where we encourage the alumni to give back to the school,” Brogan said.
Team members felt they met the goal of better connecting alumni and current students throughout the weekend.
“I think we were pretty successful in the goal to increase a more fluent network of alumni, a network where we can look for career advice and so forth,” Brogan said.
For the underclassmen on the team, the weekend showed them the importance of campus connections, even in freshman and sophomore years.
“Alumni weekend was especially great as a freshman because we were able to meet players who recently graduated, who our older teammates told us great things about and who have accomplished so much in the past for the Georgetown Hockey program,” current player Mike Pesce (MSB ’17).
Many players feel the alumni connection augments the hockey program’s effectiveness.
“I think alumni connections are essential for continuing the Georgetown hockey tradition. The 75 years that the program has existed has established a strong network that is still coming back to support the current team through donating and organizing events such as the alumni weekend,” Pesce said.
In order to connect alumni to the program, Stan Lechner (LAW ’83) leads the Hockey Booster Club, which encourages alumni to give donations. The existence of the Booster Club allows the program to increase funding and further legitimize the program.
“The Booster Club has really done a lot over the past eight or nine years,” Fritz said.
“Back when we played, we had no money, and now they have the Booster club, and really involved parents, which has created a much more formal team than when I was at Georgetown.”
Due to these efforts, the Georgetown Club Hockey program feels that alumni play a vital role in the continued existence of the team.
“I think the alumni have a lot to do with keeping the team alive, maintaining connections, financial support. We welcome donations to the Booster Club, and it’s just another great tie for alumni to have to the university,” Fritz said.
In light of the increasing success of the Georgetown Hockey Club program, questions have been raised as to the potential for the team to become a Division 1 Varsity sport at the university. Although the players are not aware of any current formal arrangements for such an endeavor, it is certainly something that players would support.
“I believe we have the right kind of players and program that could successfully transition hockey into a varsity sport at Georgetown if it were possible,” Pesce said.
The success and increased support of the program are factors that could add to a smooth transition to a varsity team.
“I think everyone would like to see hockey more recognized by the university. From the club sports aspect, the time, effort, travel and talent that we have prove that we could be a successful Division 1 team, and I think it would be a great addition to the sports at Georgetown,” Brogan said.
Although such plans are far off, the success of this year’s alumni weekend for the Georgetown Club Hockey program shows a bright future for the team.

A team of four students from the Georgetown School of Continuing Studies won first place in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s CASE Competition on March 28.
The students, Jamie Minkler (GRD ’14), Mark Schrieber (GRD ’14), Damon Orobona (GRD ’14), and Nicole Snarski (GRD ’14), are graduate students from the SCS’s masters of professional studies in real estate program. The CASE Competition, organized by the Alumni Association of the MIT Center for Real Estate, brings together real estate students from around the world to create a plan for a real development site.
“We in the real estate program were thrilled with our four-student victory in the MIT competition. I think it speaks to the quality, creativity and caliber of our students, and certainly enhances the stature of our program, its international reach and its competitive advantage,” Georgetown real estate program executive Bill Hudnut wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The annual competition began in February of this year in Boston, Mass. when 48 teams competed and presented their ideas for a real world development site on the campus of MIT. From there, Georgetown was among three teams, including Harvard University and Columbia University, to advance to the final round in London where they presented their ideas at the Royal Institute of British Architects.
According to the MIT CASE Competition website, the competition “provides graduate real estate students an opportunity to compete, showcase their knowledge and learn from each other in connection with choosing a development program, preparing financial analyses and structuring a purchase and/or joint-venture transaction for an actual complex, real world, (re)development site.”
The Georgetown team proposed a development plan for an office building in London, according to Minkler.
“Our team proposed a mixed-use development for an existing office building site in the South Bank neighborhood of London,” Minkler wrote in an email.  “It is home to ITV, a large TV station.  We proposed building ITV new office and studio space, along with building an apartment building and a hotel with condos on the top floors overlooking the River Thames.  In the middle of these structures would be an entertainment space modelled after Rockefeller Center.”
The competition required the team to develop a proposal in five days without outside help, which, Minkler said, was both a hectic and exhausting experience.
“A lot of  finance and acquisitions classes are case-based, so we all had experience with this type of assignment, but what’s was different about this was we only had five days to complete it, along with delivering a fully-functional Excel financial model,” Minkler wrote. “As we are all working full-time jobs as well, this lead to some late nights.”
Once the team won the preliminary rounds in Boston, they prepared their presentation for more rigorous judging in London. The group had a month to prepare an oral presentation to go along with a slideshow outlining the project.
“Beyond having a successful proposal, we knew we would have to ensure we framed and messaged it effectively in the short amount of time and slides we were allocated, 15 slides and 15 minutes, in order to win,” Schrieber wrote in an email. “From a very large amount of work and content, fine tuning the presentation to hit on the key aspects of the project and delivering an effective presentation was a great learning experience.”
The team presented their final product in front of a live audience and judges at London City Hall on March 28. Schrieber said that the win was an incredible experience.
“It was a great feeling to have all the hard work and preparation that went into our submission and presentation pay off,” Schrieber wrote. “The level of competition was extremely high, with the top universities in the world represented in the competition.  We were very proud to be able to represent Georgetown on the stage accepting first place.”
