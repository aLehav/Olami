It is Thursday night, and on the eighth floor of Village C West that means open-door night for Fr. David Collins, S.J., the Jesuit-in-Residence. Some students walk in and out; others have pulled up an assortment of chairs to form a circle in the living room. Most have sampled the cookie of the week: Portuguese Love Knots.
“The goal is never to repeat a cookie recipe,” Collins said, dressed in a red short-sleeved button-down shirt and jeans.
After attending to the snacks, Collins returns to his chair in the corner, just as the conversation shifts from “Dora the Explorer” to excommunication. Behind him stands a bookshelf that spans the entire wall. The titles, not to mention the conversation that fills the room, are as eclectic as their owner. A copy of “Civilization of the Middle Ages,” stands alongside “Hitler’s Priests: Catholic Clergy and National Socialism,” with biblical commentaries on the Gospels of Matthew and Luke nearby. The voice and melody of Ray Charles drifts in the background.
Collins says the atmosphere is part of the learning experience for students.
“It fits into the bigger picture of what it means to be a professor at a university,” Collins said.
 
A day in the life of Collins showcases the modern roles of a Jesuit at Georgetown: professor, researcher, chaplain and priest.
Collins’ day starts early at 5 a.m. While much of campus remains asleep, Collins takes 45 minutes to reflect and pray. The format for this time period is unstructured — a deliberate choice.
“I let my mind and soul wander,” Collins said.
Afterwards, Collins heads to Yates to work out. At 6 a.m, the campus is serene. Breakfast at Wolfington Hall, where most of the Jesuit community resides, follows before his day truly begins.
On this particular Friday morning, Collins leads a discussion section as part of his introduction to European civilization history course. Once again the students form a circle around Collins, though this time sitting in desks.
As he introduces “What We Knew,” a compilation of oral interviews collected during the rise of Nazi Germany, Collins looks at ease, leaning back in his chair with the top button of his clerical clothing undone. He uses his hands freely to emphasize his points. After his introduction, he tries to curb his own enthusiasm
for the text and lets the students take over the class.
“I don’t want to have to do that much talking,” he said.
In contrast to this relaxed group setting, Collins gives formal lectures on Tuesdays and Thursdays. As for the rest of his week, Mondays and Wednesdays are devoted to to his own scholarly work, which centers on magic and superstition throughout history. Ideally for Collins, the divide between teaching and research should be 50-50; but he finds that when a balance is hard to achieve, he always sides with teaching.
“If I spent an hour researching for every hour teaching, there would be no hours left for sleeping,” Collins said.
Nevertheless, Collins finds time to develop his own work, which is organized on a cryptic-looking whiteboard that hangs from a wall in his office.
As part of his hefty workload, he is organizing a panel for a conference on superstition, writing a book on Albert the Great, constructing a chapter on the late medieval church, editing a chapter of an anthology and analyzing a 15th-century text that has never been studied, all while mentoring several graduate students also pursuing their own projects.
Around 5 p.m. his responsibilities as a faculty member end, and Collins heads over to the Jesuit residence. A daily community Mass is said at 5:45 p.m., at which the homily is expected to be insightful but brief. After all, dinner awaits at 6:30 p.m.
“I couldn’t tell you what we talked about,” Collins says with an ambiguous smile.
Returning to his room in Village C West after dinner, Collins takes time to relax and unwind. Sometimes he turns on his stereo. Other times, he sits back and watches television — his guilty pleasure is South Park. By 9 p.m., Collins begins preparing for the next day before heading to bed.
 
“For it is through him, with him and in him. In the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God forever and ever.”
“Amen,” the congregation responds, as Collins raises the Eucharist toward the ceiling of Dahlgren Chapel.
The regular celebrant of the 5 p.m. liturgy on Sundays, Collins begins preparation for Mass much earlier in the week. The readings for the service occasionally become a source of reflection for his morning prayer, but he finds that often it is best to let the meaning of the Gospel develop subconsciously.
“The ideas gestate. I don’t really have to be paying attention to them,” Collins said.
Saturday night, these internal ruminations begin to take shape. Collins begins by referring to his sources of biblical commentaries that augment his personal reflections. For the history teacher, preparing a homily is much like preparing a lecture. The goal is to develop a main idea and support it with references from the day’s Scripture.
“I can bring up heavy issues that cause people to question things, but [I] always end on a hopeful note,” he said. “Sometimes I do it better than
others.”
The fusion of professor and priest is on display during his 10-minute address to the congregation. Reminiscent of his classroom demeanor, Collins makes constant use of his hands, explaining the significance of sight as seen through Jesus’ healing of a blind man in the Bible.
Standing on the other side of the altar, Collins sees the diverse  crowd at the 5 p.m. Mass.
“You just see this cross-section of humanity,” he said. “What a privileged view I have of the human condition.”
The white collar of priesthood might to some seem like a hefty responsibility. However, Collins sees himself on the same level as those surrounding him.
“I like to fashion myself, in a sense, as not so extraordinary,” Collins said. “[Students] deal with me at my verbal wittiest and verbal clumsiest.”
Collins finds that by crossing paths with students each day in his various roles, he serves as a subtle reminder that priests can be ordinary, too — even if their vocation aims to transcend mere worldly matters.

Members of Congress coasted to victory in a hoops clinic against Georgetown University Law Center faculty and staff on Wednesday night, raising a record sum for a charity that provides legal aid to D.C.’s homeless.
A star-studded congressional team, the “Hill’s Angels,” was powered by Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) and Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) on its way to a 61-49 win against the “Hoya Lawyas” in the 24th annual Home Court Charity Basketball Game.
Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and President Obama’s personal aide, Reggie Love, also played for the political juggernaut.
The exhibition game, orchestrated primarily by law students, raised more than $414,000 for the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless. The charity provides free legal services to the D.C. homeless on issues ranging from unfair evictions to acquiring food stamps.
About 350 people filled the bleachers at the Trinity-Washington University basketball center, many of them students who came to cheer on the Law Center team. A new addition to the Hoya Lawyas was William Treanor, the Law Center’s dean.
“We won last year, and I have to say this year they’ve gone all-out,” Treanor said at halftime. “They’ve got one former pro player and at least three former college players, but we’re pretty pleased with what we’re doing. We have the most heart.”
Sen. Brown, known in his playing days as “Downtown Scotty Brown” at Tufts University, led the Hill’s Angels in scoring with 15 points. Thune, who also played in college and whom Brown calls “the fastest man in Congress,” added nine points and eight rebounds.
Duncan, a co-captain in his days with the Harvard Crimson, also had a brief professional stint in Australia. The secretary of education also played in this year’s NBA All-Star Weekend celebrity basketball game in Los Angeles. He scored nine points Wednesday and led his team in assists.
“This is the least I could do to come out and support this extraordinary cause,” Duncan said after the game. “The students are doing such great work and making a huge difference in the community, so I was happy to be a small, small part of this.”
Rooting for both squads were cheerleaders from Georgetown and Thurgood Marshall Academy Public Charter High School in Southeast D.C. Jack the Bulldog also made an appearance to devour a box topped by a miniature Capitol dome replica.
The competitive contest was filled with memorable moments. In the first half, Brown blocked the shot of Associate Professor Laura Donohue, drawing a chorus of boos from the crowd. On the first possession of the second half, Reggie Love, a former national champion with Duke University’s Blue Devils, threw down a powerful two-handed dunk.
“I just wanted to remind everyone that I was here,” he said.
Reggie Love, a frequent basketball partner of President Obama, said he hopes the president can make it out to one of the next editions of the Home Court classic.
The congressional team was led by Thune and Sen. Robert Casey, Jr. (D-Pa.) and coached by Rep. Laura Richardson (D-Calif.). The team featured three senators, two Senate aides and five members of the House of Representatives along with Duncan and Love. In 24 years, Home Court has raised nearly $4 million for the legal clinic, mostly through donations from attendees. The annual game provides over one-third of the charity’s budget.
“I was stunned at over $400,000 — it’s amazing,” Duncan said. “To see all the time and effort that the students put in, this what it’s all about. These are the future leaders. They are making a huge impact in the community. I’m just so proud of what they’re doing.”
Students also got a chance to get in on the action, when Aladdin Jaloudi (LAW ’12) sank a half-court shot to win $10,000. Jaloudi, whose raffle ticket won him the chance for the shot, banked in the heave after it circled around the rim several times.
“I think the odds that I would make that shot were about five percent,” Jaloudi said after making the basket. He said he had not touched a basketball in over six months and was mostly trying not to embarrass himself.
“I’m going to pay maybe 10 percent of my debt that I owe to all of the people sitting over there,” Jaloudi said of his plans for the $10,000 as he pointed to the Law Center’s bench.

While most students begin courses at Georgetown just months after graduating from high school, some accepted students are opting to take a gap year before embarking on their university careers.
The Wall Street Journal reported in December that a Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles found that 1.2 percent of freshmen at four-year colleges waited a year before enrolling in school.
The choice to take a gap year can reflect a desire to relax after high school, to give meaning and direction to later classroom experiences or to break away from a traditional or limited academic trajectory, according to Georgetown students who took the leap.
For Anne Jamison (SFS ’14), a gap year was a necessary break after four years at an intense high school.
“I really needed a break. … If I’d come to Georgetown straight from high school I would have been burned out,” she said.
After a year abroad as an outdoor education teaching assistant in Australia’s Victorian Alps, Jamison is taking 19 credits per semester in a curriculum inspired by her gap year.
“I had time to decompress and now I’m so excited to work. I came back so excited to start learning again,” Jamison said.
Gabriel Pincus (SFS ’14), who split his gap year between an Israel-based environmental studies program and a backpacking tour of Europe, said that a gap year was a way to break free of the life path students in the United States are expected to follow.
“America sets up this track that’s like a race. When you’re expected to stuff your résumé, go to college, go to law school and get your first job, when do you live anymore?” Pincus said.
Jake Sneeden (SFS ’12) devoted his time in between graduation and convocation to traveling in Australia and New Zealand.
“I knew I wanted to take a gap year my junior year in high school when I was reading Conrad’s ‘Heart of Darkness,’ and it sort of struck me that my experiences that I had had were not raw or powerful, but rather just repeating an old pattern, a worn path,” he wrote in an email.
Some who took gap years said their experiences have provided valuable insights that have enhanced their studies at Georgetown.
Zander Rounds (SFS ’14), who participated in an international development program in Ecuador, China, India and South Africa, said that his experiences have helped him contextualize what he is learning in the classroom.
“Let’s say I’m in [Map of the Modern World] and we’re talking about an issue in India. I’ve been there and seen it and worked with people and talked to people there. Having that context to draw on has enriched my academic experience,” Rounds said.
Pincus said that his year abroad sparked a new interest in sustainable international development, inspiring him to pursue the Science, Technology and International Affairs program at Georgetown.
“It’s very different from what I would have been doing, and I’m so glad for that,” he said.
Greg Miller (SFS ’14) spent a year in Blagoveshchensk, Russia, studying Russian at the local university. He said that his gap year instilled an intrepidness that has helped him to maximize his time at Georgetown.
“The most valuable thing I learned was to never say no, to always go out there and try new things. This has meant that at Georgetown I’ve taken advantage of so many opportunities and lived life to the fullest,” Miller said.
While students who took gap years were positive about their experiences, they highlighted several challenges and said that gap years may not be a good choice for every student. Pincus highlighted the obstacles of his living situation.
“Being a guest for months is a really hard thing. I had to be on my game all the time. It’s dangerous not to be,” Pincus said. “I think it’s true that gap years aren’t for everyone.”
Sneeden said that the wide array of challenges posed by different gap year experiences means anyone can select an experience that will keep him or her comfortable — but only those who want to make the most out of their gap years should take them, he said.
“I think gap years are for anyone who wants to do them, because there is so much variety to what you can do, but if you aren’t ambitious, plan poorly and just lose the year doing nothing, you’re obviously going to be miserable and not take anything away from it,” he said.
While students said the transition from their gap year to the freshman class at Georgetown went more smoothly than expected, they cited certain challenges.
Ivy Otradovec (COL ’14), who visited every continent but one during her gap year, found it difficult to adjust to the structured, regimented lifestyle at Georgetown after a year of freedom.
“I wasn’t used to having any routine or regime. If I loved it somewhere, I could chill there for a month. Suddenly I come here and there’s a random institution trying to enforce deadlines and routines and hours, right down to when the dining hall is open and closed. It seemed insane,” she said.
Pincus said that the contrast between the experiential learning of his gap year and day-to-day classroom life at Georgetown can prove
challenging.
“I get bouts of feeling that I’m not doing anything important here,” he said. “But there’s an absolute value in being in an academic setting, and I see classroom learning in a completely different way.”
Rounds said he was nervous about coming to Georgetown after a year spent without tests or exams, but the transition was smoother than expected because of the intensive nature of his gap year program.
“While I was traveling I had a pretty rigorous curriculum. I was reading as much as I am at Georgetown now, so I was prepared for the academics here,” he said.
Pincus expressed concern that gap years are presented as a less safe path than the traditional one, especially by high school guidance counselors, even if they yield positive results.
“What concerns me is that there are many more people who could manage taking a gap year and could benefit tremendously but don’t do it because guidance counselors in high school present it as a risk,” he said.
While Georgetown supported his decision to take a gap year, Pincus said universities should be more open in backing the option.
“Georgetown should recommend that incoming freshmen do gap years. It definitely doesn’t detract from the college experience at all. It actually adds to it so much,” Miller said.

University officials have submitted an amended 2010 Campus Plan to the D.C. Zoning Commission, offering several major concessions in response to community pressure.
The revised plan, submitted last Thursday, proposes a freeze on undergraduate enrollment for the first time in university history, a cap on main-campus enrollment and 250 new beds on campus exclusively for undergraduate use.
The original version, filed in late December, offered no new housing. In an interview with The Hoya on Monday afternoon, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said the Leavey Center hotel could potentially be converted to house students.
The Zoning Commission, the final arbiter of the campus plan, will begin hearing the case for and against the plan on April 14. The pre-hearing submission, which was the last opportunity for the university to amend its plan, also offers to move over 1,000 students enrolled in the School of Continuing Studies off campus to satellite locations, and to eliminate plans for additional parking spaces.
Scott Stirrett (SFS ’13), president of DC Students Speak, a group of students from District universities that advocate for students’ rights in the city, supports the university’s amended proposal.
“When groups like Citizens Association of Georgetown and the Burleith Citizen Association complain about added graduate students, we find that very perplexing because graduate students don’t pose the same concerns as undergraduates,” Stirrett said.
Much of the opposition to the Campus Plan has cited concern over increased graduate student residence in the community. But a recent report, commissioned by the university and prepared by real estate consulting firm Bolan Smart Associates, found that the proposed increase in graduate student enrollment will have a low impact on Burleith and West Georgetown because less than four percent of graduate and School of Continuing Studies students reside in these areas. Complaints lodged against the university have also focused on an assertion that students create a downturn in real estate. According to the report, however, home prices in Burleith have increased more than have prices in the District as a whole over the past decade.
“There is no conclusive evidence to suggest that graduate students have an adverse impact on home values or neighborhood appearance in Burleith,” the report says.
Lenore Rubino, president of the BCA and local real estate agent for Coldwell Banker, has been a vocal opponent of the Campus Plan and remains skeptical of the report’s validity.
“They really think [Bolan Smart] would say anything else?” Rubino said. ‘They were hired by Georgetown.”
Rubino asserted that Georgetown is damaging the Burleith neighborhood.
“The BCA believes that the university has gotten too big,” she said, “and it can’t handle its increasing enrollment. And because of that it’s spilling out into the surrounding community and put quite a burden on us.”
According to the plan’s critics, undergraduate and graduate students living in the area maintain a lower standard of living than their neighbors. Not according to Bolan Smart, however.
“Findings suggest that a few very poorly maintained homes, some of which are undergraduate student rentals, may be influencing a general perception that graduate student housing is less well-maintained than non-graduate student housing,” the report states.
Concerns have also arisen over student noise and rowdy behavior. The report says that six graduate student residencies in fall 2010 were associated with calls involving law enforcement.
Despite the findings of the report and the amendments, neighborhood commissions will likely not withdraw their opposition to the plan. Advisory Neighborhood Commission 3D, which includes Foxhall and the Palisades, passed a resolution earlier this year opposing the plan. Vice Chair Stuart Ross said that the university’s changes do not affect his position on the plan.
“I did read the about the changes they had made, which would not cause me to suggest the ANC withdraw its opposition,” Ross said.
Ross said the ANC was concerned with the loop road, which he said would damage the scenic nature of the nearby parkland due to the greater bus traffic it would cause.
The university consulted the Office of Planning and the District Department of Transportation before making its pre-hearing submission. Olson said the loop road would enable buses to serve several on-campus stops.
“Our GUTS bus system now serves over two million riders throughout the year … We’re committed to being good neighbors by seeing that we minimize automobile use and maximize the use of that service. We believe the loop road really helps us to do that,” Olson said.
The pre-hearing submission also includes illustrations to demonstrate that the loop road will not damage the scenery and will be mostly invisible from within or across the park.
Additional concessions include reduced use of Kehoe Field, abandoning plans for a new convocation center and housing on the block housing 1789 Restaurant, Wisemiller’s and The Tombs.
The revised plan notes several times that the “financial constraints faced by a top-tier university with far fewer endowment assets than its peer institutions” make this plan a reasonable one. The importance of student tuition revenue is also emphasized as a way to compensate for enrollment caps. The plan states that its “significant concessions” are “expressly predicated on adoption of all of all of the elements of the 2010 Campus Plan.”

The Student Activities Commission agreed Monday to consider implementing some of the funding guidelines suggestions voiced by student groups in a town hall held last week.
With a nod to student concerns, SAC raised the possibility of amending the funding guidelines, perhaps as early as the end of this semester.  In the short term, SAC agreed to create five committees that will present final reports and suggestions for amendments on April 18. Interested student group leaders will be invited to participate in each working group.
SAC Chair Andrew Koenig (COL ’12) said that he appreciated last week’s vigorous debate.
“I was very encouraged by the turnout,” he said, “and I was also encouraged by the quality of the discussion.”
The commission discussed many of the concerns students raised during the town hall, namely the new bulk allocation system. The revised funding process, put in place at the end of last semester, provides student groups with a lump sum each semester based on the schedule in their programming arc.
One of the committees will focus on the possibility of allowing groups to add zero allocation events — or events that do not require SAC funding — to their programming schedules during the semester.
For now, the bulk funding system will remain in place. Koenig said that the new system allowed SAC a greater amount of flexibility this semester.
“In previous semesters, we would have spent a majority of the meeting time discussing funding,” he said.  “Now, we’re able to devote more time to looking at the merits of actual student events.”
The second committee will discuss an independent appeals process for funding allocation decisions. Earlier this semester, student leaders sent two open letters to SAC commissioners requesting the implementation of such a process.
Other working groups will evaluate meeting procedures and openness, advocacy on behalf of groups to other campus organizations such as the Office of Campus Activity Facilities and a procedure for groups to follow up with SAC after events.
Ruiyong Chen (SFS ’13), SAC vice chair, said the group would also consider several other long-term concerns, including proposals for an ad hoc approval process and modifications to the event categories system. Such changes could be implemented by next spring.
SAC commissioners said they hope student group leaders will participate in the committees to shape reforms.
“Groups have a lot of good ideas to improve our system,” Koenig said.  “And while these discussions should have happened from the start, we’re working now to do what we can to incorporate their ideas.”
For some SAC members, the meeting offered a chance to urge the rest of the committee to act quickly to address student criticisms.
“I think the major call-out that we need to consider in the next few weeks is a timeline,” SAC commissioner Kolby Keo (COL ’14) said.
“What actions can we take, what actions are reasonable. If we’re not going to do something and go in one direction, we’re going to have to justify our reasoning.”

Zander Rounds (SFS ’14), who participated in an international development program in Ecuador, China, India and South Africa, said that his experiences have helped him contextualize what he is learning in the classroom.
“Let’s say I’m in [Map of the Modern World] and we’re talking about an issue in India. I’ve been there and seen it and worked with people and talked to people there. Having that context to draw on has enriched my academic experience,” Rounds said.
Pincus said that his year abroad sparked a new interest in sustainable international development, inspiring him to pursue the Science, Technology and International Affairs program at Georgetown.
“It’s very different from what I would have been doing, and I’m so glad for that,” he said.
Greg Miller (SFS ’14) spent a year in Blagoveshchensk, Russia, studying Russian at the local university. He said that his gap year instilled an intrepidness that has helped him to maximize his time at Georgetown.
“The most valuable thing I learned was to never say no, to always go out there and try new things. This has meant that at Georgetown I’ve taken advantage of so many opportunities and lived life to the fullest,” Miller said.
While students who took gap years were positive about their experiences, they highlighted several challenges and said that gap years may not be a good choice for every student. Pincus highlighted the obstacles of his living situation.
“Being a guest for months is a really hard thing. I had to be on my game all the time. It’s dangerous not to be,” Pincus said. “I think it’s true that gap years aren’t for everyone.”
Sneeden said that the wide array of challenges posed by different gap year experiences means anyone can select an experience that will keep him or her comfortable — but only those who want to make the most out of their gap years should take them, he said.
“I think gap years are for anyone who wants to do them, because there is so much variety to what you can do, but if you aren’t ambitious, plan poorly and just lose the year doing nothing, you’re obviously going to be miserable and not take anything away from it,” he said.
While students said the transition from their gap year to the freshman class at Georgetown went more smoothly than expected, they cited certain challenges.
Ivy Otradovec (COL ’14), who visited every continent but one during her gap year, found it difficult to adjust to the structured, regimented lifestyle at Georgetown after a year of freedom.
“I wasn’t used to having any routine or regime. If I loved it somewhere, I could chill there for a month. Suddenly I come here and there’s a random institution trying to enforce deadlines and routines and hours, right down to when the dining hall is open and closed. It seemed insane,” she said.
Pincus said that the contrast between the experiential learning of his gap year and day-to-day classroom life at Georgetown can prove challenging.
“I get bouts of feeling that I’m not doing anything important here,” he said. “But there’s an absolute value in being in an academic setting, and I see classroom learning in a completely different way.”
Rounds said he was nervous about coming to Georgetown after a year spent without tests or exams, but the transition was smoother than expected because of the intensive nature of his gap year program.
“While I was traveling I had a pretty rigorous curriculum. I was reading as much as I am at Georgetown now, so I was prepared for the academics here,” he said.
Pincus expressed concern that gap years are presented as a less safe path than the traditional one, especially by high school guidance counselors, even if they yield positive results.
“What concerns me is that there are many more people who could manage taking a gap year and could benefit tremendously but don’t do it because guidance counselors in high school present it as a risk,” he said.
While Georgetown supported his decision to take a gap year, Pincus said universities should be more open in backing the option.
“Georgetown should recommend that incoming freshmen do gap years. It definitely doesn’t detract from the college experience at all. It actually adds to it so much,” Miller said.

With The New York Times’ recent suspension of free access to its online edition, members of Georgetown University Student Association are encouraging the university to coordinate an online subscription for students.
On March 28, The New York Times limited online users to 20 free articles a month.
Colleges and universities that purchase a certain number of print copies are eligible to receive a discount on a digital subscription for all students, faculty and staff.
According to GUSA Executive Chief of Staff Mike Barclay (COL ’12), the number of print copies distributed on campus with the Collegiate Readership Program’s renewal renders the university eligible for online discounts.
GUSA Senator Tyler Sax (COL ’13), one of the key players in bringing back the program — which provides free copies of The New York Times, The Washington Post and USA Today to campus — said GUSA’s first priority would be to make sure that the existing program is sustainable. However, he said that expansion could be possible next semester.
“If the current administration wants to make online subscriptions a priority, then we will start to look into the feasibility of this addition to the program and likely look to implement it in the fall,” Sax said.
According to Rachel Pugh, director of media relations, the university will wait for more information on The New York Times subscription deal before making a decision. Student and college discount information will be available in the upcoming weeks, according to the Times website.
Lauinger Library currently offers The New York Times articles on its online database. Students, faculty and staff can access current and past articles of the newspaper, dating back to 1851 and available in database form without direct access to The Times website.
According to Dawn Stephen, Lauinger’s head of electronic resources, this service will continue despite changes with Times’ subscriptions.
Annalise Windsor (COL ’14) said she thought Georgetown students should have free access to the site.
“I think getting an online subscription would be a good idea, because I would be less willing to subscribe and pay myself,” she said.

Nightly Noms, a bakery staffed entirely by students, is trying to satisfy the cravings that O’Donovan Hall late night and The Corp’s cookies cannot.
Since its launch a year ago, the company co-founded by Elizabeth Sabol-Jones (COL ’13) has since developed the variety of goods it offers as well as its operation schedule.
The company delivers homemade treats around the campus community every Wednesday night. Nightly Noms largely operates from orders through the company’s website, which also features reviews and original recipes.
“I wanted to give the students an opportunity to utilize their resources, as well as to not feel so restricted to the on campus dining options,” Sabol-Jones said.
Customers generally order online, and Nightly Noms’ small staff delivers the treats to all Georgetown campus buildings every Wednesday night between 10 p.m. and 12 a.m. Student customers said that the local focus of Nightly Noms was part of its appeal.
“Ordering is really easy, and everything is delicious. I know for a fact that everything is always really good,” James Pickens (COL ’12) said. “It’s great because you order something warm, and it is still warm by the time it is delivered to you.”
A portion of each week’s profits is donated to Operation Smile, a charity devoted to performing reconstructive surgery for impoverished children born with facial deformities. Nightly Noms recently funded two “smiles” from the profits made during the fall semester.
“It is wonderful to be able to participate in the fundraising for an operation that these children would otherwise not be able to afford,” Sabol-Jones said.
Nightly Noms’ customers have also used the company’s services for philanthropic means.
“One boy last week ordered two dozen cookies for me to distribute to all of the late-night swipe desk guards,” Sabol-Jones said.
Sabol-Jones was inspired to found  the bakery after receiving high praise for the banana bread that she brought to a meeting of the Compass Fellows, a campus social entrepreneurship group.
“Not only did I enjoy the creative part of throwing things together to make something new and delicious, but I also loved the way that food and my baking brought people together to socialize and enjoy whatever I had decided to make on a whim,” Sabol-Jones said.
She established Nightly Noms as a company after deciding that she could not continue to fund her baking hobby independently.
Sabol-Jones plans to re-structure the company’s blog in order to share new elements of cuisine she will experience in China, where she will be studying abroad in the fall. She is also hoping to increase the size of her company by employing two new bakers and developing new recipes to become a larger presence on campus. The company is currently staffed by Sabol-Jones, Sarah Fox (COL ’13) and Rachel Hochstetler (COL ’13), and all three have been integral in the delivery process.
Nightly Noms also hopes to break into the tech savvy market on the Hilltop by placing CR codes, digitalized blocks that smart phones can recognize as a website, around campus for students to order on the spot.

A study by Todd Wyatt, a doctoral student at George Mason University, has found that the “work hard, play hard” attitude of students at many elite universities negatively affects their GPAs.
The study indicates that drinking is equivalent only to time spent studying as the most significant predictor of students’ GPAs, demonstrating a greater effect than working, social networking, watching television and even attending classes.
The study also showed that students who drink and also participate in other volunteer or extracurricular activities are less likely to experience negative consequences from drinking, possibly because they make more calculated choices about alcohol.
Patrick Kilcarr, Director of Georgetown University’s Center for Personal Development, says that students on the Hilltop drink primarily to combat stress. While Hoyas are very invested in their academics, this mentality does not always translate into their social activities, according to Kilcarr.
“Alcohol use is related to the mechanisms [students] use to de-stress, which for some result in hangovers, lost next days and other very real social and personal consequences,” Kilcarr wrote in an email.
Kilcarr said that many of the students at Georgetown regard “work hard, play hard” as a motto that enables students to reward themselves for the work they do during the school week with alcohol on the weekends.
“I do think this motto drives many of our students and after a week or so of working extremely hard, they give themselves permission to completely cut loose,” Kilcarr wrote in an email. “The problem associated with this is the remarkable common sense that guides their behavior through the majority of their life is suspended for a period of time in order to relax and have fun.”
Drinking can be tied to an unhealthy social environment based on alcohol, according to Kilcarr.
“This may be suggestive of alcohol being the real social lubricant as opposed to a group of people coming together to enjoy each other’s company, and alcohol happens to be part of the broader social experience.”
Kilcarr said he has heard many students say that they would like to attend parties at which drinking is less of a focus.
Kilcarr sees hundreds of students a year at Georgetown and admires the courage of those who recognize their negative relationships with alcohol and want to make a change.
Kilcarr also stressed the amount of attention Georgetown gives to making sure students have a rich, safe college experience, through programs such as AlcoholEdu and the Engelhard program.
Amanda Applebaum (MSB ’13), however, believes that drinking on Georgetown’s campus doesn’t seem to have a detrimental effect on academics.
“As a student it seems that Georgetown is making a very strong effort to curb the amount of drinking on campus but I think [drinking] is an inevitable part of every campus life. It occurs on nearly every campus but, from what I see, Georgetown students are better able to manage their school work and social activities so that it doesn’t really impede on academics as much,” Applebaum said.

The School of Foreign Service unveiled the Religion, Ethics and World Affairs Certificate, a new undergraduate certificate formed in conjunction with the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs, on Friday.
The certificate, which will be available next semester, aims to address the role of religion in international affairs in a manner yet to be offered by other disciplines at Georgetown, according to Thomas Banchoff, the director of the Berkley Center and an associate professor in the government department and the SFS.
“Other majors and certificates explore international relations and particular religious traditions,” Banchoff wrote in an email. “But until now there [have] been none that [address] the religion-ethics-world affairs interface in a structured way.”
The Berkley Center plans to accept 15 applicants, eventually including those from schools outside the SFS, to the program each semester, according to Banchoff.
SFS students said that they are excited for the opportunity to incorporate a religious perspective into their undergraduate study of international relations.
“It’s about time that the SFS incorporated theology into its higher academic curriculum,” Ben Talus (SFS ’14) said.
According to Banchoff, recent world events — including the Arab-Israeli conflict, Muslim-Hindu relations in South Asia and the wars against Iraq, Afghanistan and terrorism — inspired the certificate.
The program has three academic concentrations: faith and ethics in international relations, religion and politics seen through a comparative perspective and religion in history and culture. Through these areas of study, the coursework will explore the role of religion in culture and domestic and international politics. Available classes will be offered through a variety of academic departments, including government, history, theology and international affairs.
“I see the certificate as a way to solidify our contribution to the undergraduate curriculum and deepen our collaboration with [the] SFS,” Banchoff wrote.
The certificate also includes an original research component organized through a capstone seminar led by Banchoff, who will work closely with the students. Possible topics include the connections between religion and ethics in relation to democracy and human rights, economic and social development and international security.
Seminar students will be required to present their research each spring at an annual colloquium and the winning body of work will be published on the certificate’s website.
The Berkley Center also hopes to create a sense of community for its certificate members through sponsored study breaks for students and lunch seminars with program faculty.
“The Berkley Center thrives on close faculty-student collaboration in research, outreach and teaching,” Banchoff wrote. “Informal interaction through study breaks and lunches can complement the work we do together in the classroom.”
Jaclyn Markowitz (SFS ’14) viewed the creation of the certificate as a logical step for the SFS.
“A lot of times I think people underestimate the effect of religion in other culture,” Markowitz said. “If Georgetown has such strong government, international affairs and theology departments, why not combine them?”

Fashion designer Kenneth Cole announced a partnership with Compass Partners Inc. on Friday, stitching the two organizations together with a $500,000 pledge of financial support.
The deal was made public at the first annual gathering of the Compass Fellows, a group founded at Georgetown and now comprised of over 150 undergraduate students. The Fellows, who study at Georgetown, American University, The George Washington University, Indiana University and Tufts University, are aspiring entrepreneurs interested in business and social justice.
William Huster, brand manager of Compass Partners Inc., and Neil Shah (MSB ’10), co-founder of the fellowship, confirmed that Compass Partners will use Cole’s donation to extend its fellows program to between 12 and 15 schools next fall, including University of California, Berkeley, Stanford University and Fordham University.
The organization will branch out to Boston, New York City, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., and allow students to regularly exchange ideas, meet and collaborate with other fellows.
Shah said that Compass’ first program, created at Georgetown in 2009, serves as a model for this growth.
“Our original 15 [Fellows] from Georgetown, we had such a close bond. We figured out entrepreneurship was more than just teaching someone about spreadsheets,” Shah said.
Cole said the new affiliation will allow Compass to expand and offer future business leaders more educational opportunities to interact with one another and assist the world around them.
“Together we will seek to identify, encourage and empower the next generation of change agents,” Cole said in a speech to the fellows at the Shift Series conference. “We hope to teach the skills necessary to navigate public, private, for profit [and] not-for-profit universes. The process will encourage the taking down of walls and the building of new state-of-the-art proverbial bridges.”
Huster said that Cole’s monetary contribution of $500,000 will be issued over a span of three years. He added that there is discussion about giving Cole a more active role in the project, possibly by offering him a spot on Compass’ board of directors.
Shah said that he and co-founder Arthur Woods (MSB ’10) first contacted Cole after hearing of his sponsorship of a similar civic engagement project at Columbia University.
When Cole expressed interest in the organization at a meeting in New York City, the two sides entered into six months of talks discussing how their partnership could further the message of social engagement.
Since launching Kenneth Cole Productions Inc. in 1982, the fashion mogul has successfully promoted a host of social issues. Internally, he founded the company’s community outreach initiative, encouraging employees to participate in service opportunities.
He also started the Kenneth Cole Foundation’s ‘Awearness’ program, in which consumers can contribute to causes such as AIDS awareness and tsunami relief efforts in Japan by purchasing items from a specialized line of products.
“Typically in the fashion business, we redefine ourselves every few weeks with new product offerings, but if the brand is more substantive it creates a strong, if not stronger, relationship with the customer,” he said in an interview with The Hoya.
“It makes the relationship itself bigger and more important. That’s something we’ve always sought to do.”
Angela Morabito (SFS ’12), a first-generation Compass Fellow who designed her own line of women’s accessories for her Fellows project, found Cole’s message inspiring and applicable.
“There are plenty of places where you can buy a piece of square fabric, like a scarf,” she said. “What a person wears should be an affirmation of meaning.”
Morabito’s company, Headlines: Smartwear for Smart Women, supports efforts to educate women by donating a portion of its profits to organizations that promote literacy worldwide.
Nick Maida (MSB ’13), one of these original participants, said that the organization’s connection with Cole will prove beneficial for social entrepreneurs on the Hilltop.
“If you look at where Compass was 18 months ago and then look at the growth and success it has enjoyed in such a short time, the sky is the limit. This partnership will assist in that continued expansion,” Maida said.
“As a fellow, this means better access to the resources and support group that makes the Compass fellowship such a success.”
