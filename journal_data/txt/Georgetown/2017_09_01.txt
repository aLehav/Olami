The university has appointed its first full-time associate director for undocumented student services to provide support for students without documentation and coordinate legal information and resources for this community.
Arelis Palacios, who currently serves as a part-time coordinator for students without documentation and senior associate director of programming and advising in the Office of Global Education, will begin her position as associate director next Friday.
The appointment marks the university’s latest expansion of institutionalized support for Georgetown’s community of students without documentation, as President Donald Trump considers fulfilling a campaign promise to scrap the Obama administration’s Deferred Action for Child Arrivals program as early as today.
Palacios, who previously served as the school’s part-time liaison for students without documentation since November 2016 said the full-time position is the result of advocacy from a number of students, professionals and allies of students without documentation, including immigrant rights advocacy group UndocuHoyas. The position will operate through the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access.
“The creation of a full-time position for Undocumented Student Services is a culmination of years of efforts by many thoughtful, committed professionals and dynamic undocumented students and allies who have advocated for administrative support,” Palacios wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I’m continually grateful to our students for engaging in difficult dialogues, and all they have achieved in order to bring a greater awareness of the undocumented student experience to Georgetown’s campus.”
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said he hopes Palacios can expand on her work in educating and advocating for students without documentation.
“We are very pleased that Arelis Palacios is stepping into this new full-time role. Over the past several months, her support for our undocumented students, and her efforts to educate and engage our campus community, have been tremendously helpful,” Olson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We look forward to working with her, on behalf of our students, in the months ahead.”
The university’s announcement comes amid uncertainty for students without documentation at Georgetown and around the country, as the Trump administration considers scrapping the Obama administration’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
DACA, an executive policy introduced by former President Barack Obama in 2012, directs the Department of Homeland Security and other federal immigration agencies to defer immigration action and deportation proceedings of children of immigrants without documentation who arrived at an early age.
Luis Gonzalez (COL ’19), a member of UndocuHoyas, said the administration’s move is a strong sign of support from the university.
“This is huge. The associate director for undocumented student services position offers a clear indication of the strong commitment Georgetown has developed over the course of several years, and because of student-led activism,” Gonzalez said. “Many generations of UndocuHoyas have advocated for continued support for the undocumented student community and this is definitely a step in the right direction.”
Palacios said her role will differ from the responsibilities the Office of Global Services conducts for international students who have authorized legal status, including advising for internships, immigration status and family resources.
Palacios’ new position will serve undergraduate and graduate students without documentation, DACA beneficiaries, and mixed status students with unique immigration backgrounds.
Palacios said the Office of Global Services will continue to serve international students who have active F-1 and J-1 status and scholars who hold other statuses sponsored by Georgetown like H-1B, E-3, O-1 and TN visas.
Gonzalez said the appointment can help counteract some of the stress students without documentation face while at Georgetown.
“Undocumented and mixed-status students are going through challenges like living with a constant fear of deportation and uncertainty while also worrying about day-to-day Georgetown things, like getting through that Problem of God reading or writing that paper for CPS,” Gonzalez said.
Gonzalez emphasized the importance of student advocacy both at the university and national levels.
“Generations of UndocuHoyas, old and new, have been advocating for the institutionalization of resources for undocumented students,” Gonzalez said. “I am especially grateful for the UndocuHoyas who arrived to Georgetown years past and who struggled through it but made it their mission to make things better for those who would follow.”

A new initiative by the Georgetown University Student Association is set to provide 1,500 discount cards for neighborhood shops and restaurants, primarily to low-income students, marking the current administration’s first program to make daily student life more affordable.
Students with the wallet-sized GU$Avings cards can receive discounts and promotions at up to 21 local clothing stores, restaurants and entertainment options in the Georgetown neighborhood, including Ralph Lauren, Brooks Brothers and Booeymonger delicatessen.
GUSA provided cards to the Georgetown Scholarship Program and the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access on Wednesday. All members of the Georgetown Scholarship Program and all students eligible for Pell Grants are entitled to a card, according to GUSA Press Secretary Aaron Bennett (COL ’19). About 600 cards are set to be distributed to other students through academic departments or at GUSA events.
The program is the first effort by GUSA President Kamar Mack (COL ’19) and GUSA Vice President Jessica Andino (COL ’18) to make Georgetown life more affordable for students, a signature issue in their election campaign last February. Mack and Andino called affordability “the most pressing issue affecting Georgetown students” in a pre-election op-ed in The Hoya.
“It’s important that GUSA is alleviating costs in as many ways as possible,” Mack said. “I’m really excited to see how Georgetown students use [the cards] and what different experiences they have, so that this can become a sustainable addition that GUSA takes on every year.”
However, GSP Program Director Missy Foy and GSP Student Board President Emily Kaye (COL ’18) questioned the value of the program in an email to The Hoya, saying the discounts offered by local businesses on the card are meager and largely apply to nonessential luxuries.
“While we’re appreciative of any discount offered to students (and certainly students for whom finances are a significant stress should be front of line), our candid reaction is that local companies could and should do more,” Foy wrote. “We also hope in the future that this discount code might be a help towards essentials like books, food or bedding instead of tanning services and gel manicures.”
Foy also noted that many of the discounts listed on the card were no more than what students could already get with a student ID. For example, some of the cards list a 15 percent J. Crew discount, which is in fact a general student discount available to college students at all J. Crew stores.
“15% off at Ralph Lauren or Vineyard Vines or Brooks Brothers doesn’t represent a major commitment to low-income college students,” Foy wrote.
Mack responded that GUSA explored the possibility of discounts on books at the university bookstore, but was constrained by the university’s contract with Barnes & Noble. Mack also said the student discounts at J. Crew and other stores were included for informational purposes.
Student Government Perks, an internet-based service that compiles discounts, produced the cards for a fee of about $2,000, which was paid for with funding from the Division of Student Affairs, GUSA and the Office of Advancement.
According to GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff Javier Melendez (COL ’19), who worked on the discount cards program, the cards target the costs that students face off campus — a concern in the Georgetown neighborhood, where food, groceries and entertainment are notably expensive. These everyday expenses can cause financial strain from lower-income and middle-income students alike, Melendez said.
“It takes a very high family income in order to have enough financial means to casually go through a Georgetown experience without it being a financial burden on the family,” Melendez said.
Mack first heard about the discount cards from the student body presidents of Catholic University and the University of Missouri–Kansas City, who’d seen success with discount card programs at their own schools. They met at a June conference hosted by the National Campus Leadership Council, a national organization of student body leaders.
“When Georgetown interacts with more student governments, more ideas come to fruition,” Melendez said. “This shows that there are small steps we can take to make student life more affordable.”

It is disappointing to see Emily Kaye using GSP to politicize this program. Has she supported a program coming out of this administration yet?
Kaye presents the premise that GUSA projects should only support “essential” services. Supporting these services is not the responsibility of GUSA. It is the responsibility of Georgetown itself, specifically GSP. GSP exists to provide books to those who do not have them.
GUSA can address general issues. We live in a hub of America, but many of us don’t have the money to interact with it. Even if we can afford bedding, we can’t afford Bojangles. We miss out on many social and cultural opportunities because no GSP covers our incidental expenses. People who didn’t qualify for GSP but don’t have disposable income deserve opportunities too.

Shame on GU criticizing this positive effort, especially if it turns out to be little more than a turf war. I was surprised to see it, because I know GSP has the best intentions at heart. This is the first time GUSA has taken a meaningful step towards addressing an appalling division in the student body produced by differences in income levels in years. If it was so easy, GSP, why haven’t you achieved this before in a better form for all students? And why not advocate cheaper bookstore prices for all? Why discourage student leaders in a position normally dominated by rich Yahoos from taking a meaningful step?
The attempt at categorization of “essential” services somewhat pedantic. Are poor students not deserving of services other students use on a regular basis? If these discounts mean they can afford a manicure, get that damn manicure. Georgetown’s failure to understand student culture apparently continues to blind them to why the school alienates its less fortunate pupils. By and large there’s money for textbooks offered through various services (including GSP; yes, there are painful exceptions). It’s the other, social expenses that keep people on the outside looking in.
For the record, information on discounts is incredibly important, even if they are generally available. Students are probably 90% unaware of what their ID gets them. That GSP would malign this is a true shame — they know how hard it is to get this information out there, and this is an effective mechanism. 
I hope GUSA doesn’t let inappropriate criticism, and I’m sure, the unfair communications the university may forward to GSP recipients in particular, to dissuade them. Improve this program gradually and over time. Fight for better discounts once your leverage with the community improves. Cooperate with GU if they are willing to help, go forward alone if not. They’ll appropriate when it gets big enough.

Well, it’s official . . . Mack and Andino are fakes.  Discount cards for Vineyard Vines and J. Crew.  What’s next, Canada Goose and Versace?  Hell, they already got Ralph Loren.
Then is the problem with GUSA and all identity politics at Georgetown.  And America in general.  Mack and Andino are rich and privileged Black and Brown and have no problem uniting with White people so long as it benefits them and their friends.  
The real issue is class.  
Black and Brown and White lower class members should support each other.  But it is in the interest of people like Mack and Andino to divide us based on race.  There are SO MANY THINGS they could have done to unite the campus after last year.  But they chose to secure discounts for rich people, regardless of race
Shame on them.  GUSA is disgusting.  Literally, I want to vomit.  And God bless Missy Foy and Emily Kaye.  As far as I am concerned Mack and Andino have just lost legitimacy in everyone’s eyes..  Time to start over again next semester. Hell, a freaking Chicken Madness could have done better than those two.

You’re intentionally provocative, and you do not deserve a reply, but there is one substantive issue:
“Mack and Andino are rich and privileged Black and Brown” *people*. They are people. Not to be defined by the color of their skin. Your racism rears its ugly head.

Professors must rededicate themselves to the primary responsibility of the university: teaching. This is the argument of professor Jacques Berlinerblau, director of the Center for Jewish Civilization in the School of Foreign Service.
In his most recent book, “Campus Confidential,” Berlinerblau argues that the current structure of higher education and the institution of tenure have imposed a division between full professors, who have been granted tenure at research universities, and those scholars on the tenure-track pushed toward the realm of adjunct teaching. Where students fail to learn, non-tenured scholars are pushed toward poverty and the American professorate unravels and dies.
Berlinerblau laments that professors prioritize their own research and writing over substantively teaching undergraduate students; those interested in teaching are granted little academic freedom and poor financial reward.
In an interview with The Hoya, Berlinerblau criticizes the current state of higher education, addresses his critics and makes the case for a rejuvenation of Georgetown’s own teaching model.
How did the book come together?
“Campus Confidential” is deeply beholden to a literary genre known as the “campus novel.” They’re just so damn funny. These are works of fiction about dysfunctional colleges and their dysfunctional faculty and cynical administrations.
The book, in and of itself, is a sort of “meta” wink to the campus novel genre. There are actually fictional sections in the book. Not caricatures. Fiction. Fiction has its own sovereign goals, one of which is to entertain and enlighten people. To scandalize them as well. So when I was writing the book, the question I kept asking myself was, “Is this funny?” “Will it be something you can read on a beach?” “Will it upset people?” “Is the voice genuine?”
Do you think your readers get that about the book?
Yes and no. It’s a deceptively complicated text. I mean, I’m dropping f-bombs in there and I think there might actually be a reference to a d–k pic—but I’m not sure. At the same time, there are some very serious policy questions that I address with very serious answers. Like all writers, I pray for smart and discerning readers who engage on multiple levels.
Where did you get the idea to write this book?
While hanging out at dinner parties. When you were at a dinner party and your kids were 7 years old, the biggest issue for the parents was that one of those imbeciles almost choked on a Lego. But when their kids hit 15, 16, the parents start to talk about college. No more Legos! I was amused that, in these conversations, the parents would identify to me what they thought was important in a college education. And they were way off — they had no clue what college was about. They didn’t know what the issues were; they didn’t know what to look for; they didn’t know what made a college education great or crapulent. So that was the first sign for me that there was a need for an accurate, tell-all — an industry exposé about college.
Did anything else lead you to write this book?
Yes! Rage. I received my first doctorate when I was 24 years old. I could not find a tenure-track job. I was employed as an abused adjunct. I did that for seven years, and I would have to say I would never wish that experience upon my worst enemy. The fact that roughly 70 to 75 percent of all American scholars today are contingent (i.e., non-tenure line) faculty is something I find deplorable. Very few people outside academia understand this, especially parents who are paying astronomical tuition bills. I just wanted to apprise people of this crisis afflicting our guild.
Didn’t you also write this book about your concerns about the quality of college teaching?
Absolutely. Part of my frustration with being a professor over these last 25 years is the degree to which teaching gets short shrift and is looked down upon by so many in our field.
On that last point, how much of that trade-off or prioritization of research over teaching have you witnessed during your time at Georgetown?
Let’s be clear: Georgetown is an R1, a research level 1 university according to the Carnegie Classification [of Institutions of Higher Education]. It means excellent teaching, in and of itself, is never a pathway to tenure here.
Georgetown, like all of its peer-institutions, wildly prioritizes research over teaching on the tenure track. Though here’s a thought: maybe Georgetown ought to be a smidgen different, because unlike Harvard, unlike Yale, unlike Princeton, we have this glorious Jesuit tradition.
What would your ideal solution be?
We need an oxygenating infusion of Jesuits. If we’re going to rediscover our brand as Georgetown, if we’re not just going to become another big anodyne R1, we need to rediscover that which makes Georgetown special. The Jesuits are the only ones who can save us from ourselves and the absurd priorities that have obliterated the American professorate. They are the only ones who will forcefully remind us that teaching is a vocation and mentoring to students’ souls is what any serious educator should be doing. At this level, they are also serious scholars as well, so I see no trade-off for us as an R1.
You advocate for a teaching model that is closer to the classic Jesuit model. Did you develop that when you came to Georgetown in 2005 or were there other experiences that informed your approach?
There were other experiences as well. When I started my teaching career as an adjunct at the City University of New York, my students were overwhelmingly African-American and Latino and they were overwhelmingly working class. So what happened to me is what happens to a lot of CUNY professors. Unless you have ice running through your veins and a heart that is made of bauxite, you just want to give them more, even if you are not paid for it. You understand that these are hardworking kids — they might be the first in their family ever to go to college. This is where the whole idea of cura personalis really resonates for me.
Have you received any feedback yet?
I’ve done about 20 NPR [interviews] in 60 days — something crazy like that. I’ve done a lot of local and national interviews, and one guy started off the interview and said, “So, I guess you’re not the most popular guy in the faculty lounge.” I thought that was pretty funny. Then again, faculty lounges rarely exist anymore!
Tenure-line professors, especially associate and full professors, seem impervious to the charms of this book. My colleagues at rank have made it very clear to me they disagree. Either they say that my analysis about ‘afterthoughtish’ teaching is correct but they are the exception to the rule, or they say my analysis is incorrect. Contingent faculty, by contrast, have written me dozens, if not hundreds, of letters. I think they are more receptive to my arguments because to be at the bottom of any social hierarchy is often enough to see its absurdities with brutal clarity.
What is the significance of tenure? Should we just abolish it?
Almost every scholar, without exception, lines up their professional trajectory so that it culminates in a tenure-track job at a great university. The problem is that the statistics are showing us that, across the board, but especially in the humanities, something like 70 to 80 percent of all people who will receive their doctorate this year will not get a tenure-line job. So my question is: who is tenure serving? It doesn’t seem to be serving scholars most anymore. In fact, some experts believe that the institution of tenure isn’t even going to exist in 20 to 30 years. It doesn’t seem to be serving students, because the way we’ve configured tenure is that we reward research — not teaching. So if it’s not serving the majority of scholars and it’s serving very few students, then what is it good for? But since I’m a nuanced fellow, I understand why tenure exists. And tenure exists because prior to 1940, when the tenure system was instituted, professors would just disappear in the middle of the night for saying something unpopular.
If we really respect the institution of scholarship, we must bring in all the stakeholders—scholars, graduate students, university presidents, learned societies, etc.—and have a national symposium on tenure. Right now the system is broken and it’s in a kind of death spiral.
What practical suggestions do you have to ameliorate the situation?
In the book, I make a few unpopular suggestions. One is that we, the tenured, senior faculty, teach more for free. We take on an extra class or two every year. In exchange for our goodwill gesture, our administrations counter by creating more tenure-lines and more full-time non-tenure positions that are reasonably compensated. We old fuddy duddies “pay it forward” to the next generation. Also, I really think only contingent faculty should receive sabbaticals so they can focus on their research. At present, that perk only goes to tenure-line professors. Out of solidarity, we might consider letting our colleagues have a semester off to work on their articles and books.
In your book, you discuss alternative teaching models. What types of teaching models are you bringing into the classroom?
I’m a big fan of “active learning” methods. I’m pleased by how many professors, of their own volition, are abandoning the old lecture model. Back in my day, we used to lecture for about 75 minutes at a time without stopping once except to drink water. I’m convinced that students learn more with a well-conceived, active learning approach in which a professor deftly steers a conversation much in the way a jazz bassist steers other musicians to more intriguing and artful possibilities.

The Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service announced their fall 2017 class of Fellows last Wednesday, showcasing a diverse group of six policy and media experts from across the political spectrum.
The fellows include Ron Bonjean, former top spokesman for the speaker of the house and the senate majority leader; former White House Communications Director Mike Dubke; Marie Harf, former senior advisor to Secretary of State John Kerry; former Congressman Patrick Murphy (D-Fla.) and Liz Sidoti, head of U.S. communications for British Petroleum and former national political editor and correspondent at the Associated Press.
GU Politics launched an additional Fellowship opportunity this semester, welcoming anchor for NBC Nightly News Saturday and Telemundo News José Diaz-Balart as a Visiting Fellow. This slot was created to welcome a prominent public figure to campus for shorter periods of time, according to a GU Politics announcement.
GU Politics Executive Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94) said the program worked to recruit a diverse range of talents and perspectives in order to facilitate interesting and varied dialogue throughout the semester.
“We strive to find people that come from different backgrounds, cross the ideological spectrum and have different experiences,” Elleithee said. “We hope that they complement each other well in order to have the most robust conversation that we can.”
While the selection process for fellows has become increasingly competitive since the program’s inception in 2015, Elleithee said. He added he was excited to find so many individuals who want to contribute to and engage with the Georgetown community.
“We look for people who are going to be open and honest, and not just recite talking points — people who are going to be committed to the Georgetown community and really focus their time and attention here,” Elleithee said. “I think we have a really great class this semester. It’s a really good mix of experience this time.”
Throughout the fall semester, fellows will hold weekly noncredit discussion groups, hold office hours for students and speak to a variety of campus groups about their fields of expertise. Fellows are also assigned their own group of student strategists who work to help plan and promote events, research for discussion groups and connect the fellow to the broader Georgetown community. Applications for student strategists are open through Sept. 7.
“It’s another way for us to bring another voice into this conversation and give students yet another person that they can engage with, even if it’s a little bit more condensed than some of the other
Fellows,” Elleithee said.
Jessica Andino (COL ’18), who served as the undergraduate student co-chair for the GU Politics Student Advisory Board last year, said she is excited about the unique perspectives the new fellows will bring to the program this year. Andino is also Georgetown University Student Association vice president.
“They have a lot to contribute. They are able to add the perspective of what happens behind the scenes for national decisions,” Andino wrote in an email to The Hoya. “These are the people that we may not see, but they have a lot of expertise to discuss with students about the processes that happen in things that we may not see at the surface level otherwise.”

The McDonough School of Business’s Executive Masters in Leadership program welcomed back the first-ever joint cohort of principals from Washington, D.C. public and public charter schools.
The cohort, which began classes in January, comprises 10 principals from DCPS and 10 from public District charter schools sharing skills and knowledge while completing an 11-month degree program. Courses include options like Scenario Planning, Decision-Making, Strategy of Organizational Leadership, Leading Teams, How Leaders Develop and Anticipating the Future.
According to Robert Bies, founder of the EML program and professor in the MSB, the cohort is designed to facilitate cross-sector dialogue and projects.
“The strength of a DCPS principal is that they’re part of a system, and, therefore, knowledge can be shared among a network and certain resources can be shared across a system of schools,” Bies said. “On the other hand, with most public charter schools, they’re formed like an entrepreneurial startup. So what they do well — because they’re startups — is that they’re entrepreneurial and innovative and they get the freedom to do that.”
 
Though the EML program typically costs $70,000 per participant, each principal is only responsible for $10,000 of his or her own tuition. Support for the EML program is funded, in part, by the Walton Family Foundation, a philanthropic fund, facilitated by the DC Public Education Fund.
Principal of Luke C. Moore High School Jada Langston said the cohort offers principals the opportunity to connect with colleagues they would typically only see on a limited basis.
“What I love about DC Public Schools is that I get to spend time with my colleagues,” Langston said in a statement to The Hoya. “This is an opportunity to build connections and relationships with charter school colleagues. We can do something phenomenal in this city through this cohort.”
Bies attributes the success of the program to the productive relationship between DCPS and public charter schools in the area.
“Nobody does this in the country. You couldn’t do this in New York. You couldn’t do this in Chicago. You can do this in D.C. because here public schools and public charter schools coexist. I’m not saying there’s no tension between DCPS and charter schools. There is some tension, but they do coexist,” Bies said. “They play together.”
Both DCPS and District public charter schools have commensurate enrollment numbers, with approximately 48,000 and 41,000 students enrolled respectively. Additionally, District Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) has shown broad support for public charter schools, allowing them to use public facilities and increasing their budget allotment by 2.2 percent over the next four years.
However, Bowser has proposed regulations on public charter schools in the District. In January, Bowser introduced a new policy that would force charter schools to give a preference in admissions to elementary school-aged children living within a half-mile of the school. The walkability preference will go into effect in the 2018-2019 school lottery.
Kathryn Procope, head of the Howard University Middle School of Mathematics and Science Public Charter School, said the EML program has been beneficial not only in honing her own administrative skills but also in building connections in schools around the city.
“My experience in the Georgetown EML program has been one of the best in my career. Each class has provided me with tools that I immediately use when I get back to school,” Procope wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The coursework has shaped my leadership with my staff, my students and their families. What started as cross sector collaboration between the principals has developed into deep friendships that will last long after the program is over.”
Correction: This article previously misrepresented the sources of funding for the EML program.

Highlighting the role of diversity at Georgetown and emphasizing the university’s Jesuit values, New Student Orientation welcomed 1,615 students from the Class of 2021 and 208 transfer students to the Hilltop last weekend.
Led by five student coordinators, 33 orientation captains and 198 orientation advisers, this year’s NSO built on traditional events including sexual assault awareness session “I Am Ready” and diversity and inclusion performance “Pluralism in Action,” with a renewed mission to make the Georgetown experience accessible to new students of all backgrounds from Aug. 25 to 29.
Isaiah Fleming-Klink (SFS ’19), NSO co-director of staff development, said this year’s leadership prioritized creating an NSO experience that is accessible to new students from diverse backgrounds.
“Probably the most important thing to me was creating a staff that was more reflective of the student body here at Georgetown,” Fleming-Klink said. “NSO is, historically, like many other big clubs, a really white organization both demographically but also culturally in all the different everyday things that we do.”
NSO will look to continue offering programming for diverse student bodies in future years, according to Co-Director of Staff Development Samantha Smith (NHS ’19).
“I think that we laid the foundation and that if we, when the next year’s coordinators come into the role, if they have a similar commitment and mission as we did, that we can truly make an impact over multiple years and multiple generations of incoming classes of students,” Smith said.
This year’s program also offered a renewed commitment to Jesuit values through training initiatives, NSO Orientation Adviser Nick Zeffiro (SFS ’18) said.
“We got a Jesuit examen every day to close out our training, which really helped us center as a staff and really reflect and contemplate our actions over the course of the day in a Jesuit tradition,” Zeffiro said.
Fleming-Klink said he hopes new students left NSO with an understanding of the university’s commitment to Jesuit values as a foundation for their Georgetown experience.
Daniel Frumento (COL ’18), co-director of internal outreach and communications, said although fostering larger conversations on life at Georgetown should be an aim of NSO, it must also prepare new students for day-to-day life at Georgetown.
“I just wanted people to feel prepared for Georgetown. I wanted people to feel like they belonged here, and I wanted people to feel as if they made the right decision when, three months ago, they said ‘yes’ and put down their deposit,” Frumento said.
NSO Director of Logistics Sabrina Leon Landegger (COL ’19) said the orientation program aimed to include introverted students and prioritize self-care during the busy and often stressful first few weeks at Georgetown.
Christopher Hadsall (COL ’21) said that although the four-day program felt overwhelming to him at times, he appreciated the care that went into welcoming new students.
“The convocation ceremony was amazing, just the energy in the room. You have the alumni up in the stands. You also have all the administrators and staff members up on the stage,” Hadsall said. “And it was really inspiring to see all those people who are involved in the Georgetown community coming together to welcome us.”
Georgetown Weeks of Welcome started this week following NSO’s conclusion, with the Welcome Back Jack Barbecue. This year’s Welcome Back Jack Barbecue was moved to the Healey Family Student Center due to rain and featured a raffle for T-shirts.
The year’s GWOW program features an integrated team of two coordinators and 19 welcome ambassadors staffing events and leading programs to help new and returning students acclimate to life on the Hilltop over the course of six weeks.
Center for Student Engagement Director of Orientation, Transition, and Family Engagement Shane Ryan emphasized the importance of supporting students throughout the entirety of the transition process this fall.
“The first six weeks are the most crucial for students, so doing a ‘week of welcome’ was not enough. But six weeks helps them find their fit, their place, and hopefully sees them be successful and happy here on the Hilltop,” Ryan said.
Some events new to the GWOW schedule this year include the Sept. 8 Mission Georgetown game show on Cooper Field and the Sept. 16 silent disco in Sellinger Lounge. This year’s coordinators Aidan
Fallon (SFS ’19) and Ravisa Kalsi (COL ’20) said they wanted to help unite the student body and provide opportunities for students to spend time together.
“We’ve had a very intentional focus on shifting our events from just times when you can come and eat free food to a time when you can actually have a community and where you can actually meet other people and socialize,” Fallon said.

Sen. Dick Durbin (SFS ’66, LAW ’69), a Democrat from Illinois, rose to the Senate floor Aug. 2 to tell the story of one of the more than 750,00 beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. He had been talking about these immigrants for years, but this time he had a personal connection.
From underneath his lectern, he produced a visual aid with a portrait of Juan Martinez (SFS ’20).
“In his senior year of high school, he applied to his dream school — once my dream school — Georgetown University, and he was accepted,” Durbin said.
Following the election of President Donald Trump, he began partnering with Georgetown to make Hoyas the focus of his floor speeches in defense of DACA. Durbin’s advocacy on immigration reform and the future of immigrants living in the United States without authorization has persisted for more than 16 years in the Senate with support from both parties.
The legislative front is just one of the few areas where Georgetown has ratcheted up its efforts to urge the federal government to keep the policy in place. On Sept. 5, officials from ten states, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, are set to bring a lawsuit challenging the program’s legal basis.
The program, created through an executive order by President Barack Obama in 2015, provides temporary relief for deportation to immigrants who were brought here as young children and renewable two-year work authorization, provided they pass a background check, study or enlist in the military and pay a $495 fee. That order, the ten officials argue, constitutes executive overreach on the part of Obama.
But DACA might be rescinded sooner than Tuesday, with several outlets reporting the decision might come from the White House as early as today.
Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Joanne Talbot wrote in an email to The Hoya that the policy is undergoing a review process in cooperation with the Department of Justice and the White House, but no decision has been made regarding its future.
As members of the Georgetown community returned or arrived for the first time to campus for the start of a new academic year, undocumented students were particularly concerned about becoming vulnerable to deportations.
Now that they have disclosed their information and registered with the U.S. government, some fear that Immigration and Customs Enforcement might trace and target them. Luis Gonzalez (COL ’19) is one of them.
“What if that [Transportation Security Agency] agent asks for my visa when I provide them with my passport?” Gonzalez said. “Or what if I have a job on campus and that job allowed me to pay for my books or allowed me to send money back home?”
The administration might choose to rescind the program and allow the work permits to expire, which could take as long as two years. But the government could also demand the documents be returned, which would prevent beneficiaries from applying for employment and some internships.
Some students have gone as far as using tactics of civil disobedience to make their voices heard. Chris Wager Saldívar (SFS ’17) was arrested with five other activists Aug. 15 after blocking the entrance to Paxton’s office in Austin, Texas for nearly three hours.
“It was to show folks that you’re not alone and there are folks with citizenship privilege who are willing to put our well-being on the line to make sure that immigrant community are safe,” Wager Saldívar said.
Those “folks,” he said, include “my loved ones that I graduated with, studied with and organized with at Georgetown.”
Although promised to be released the next morning, Wager Saldívar spent 24 hours in Travis County Jail after being charged with a Class B misdemeanor.
Georgetown students have also turned to community organizing to help unauthorized immigrants, often referred to as Dreamers. In partnership with the Georgetown University Student Association and the Office of Federal Relations, UndocuHoyas created a program called “Friends of Dreamers,” through which constituents can send letters to their elected members of Congress telling the story of an UndocuHoya and asking for their advocacy on the issue.
“It’s always important to keep in contact with representatives, regardless of wherever the representatives are, even if they’re Democrats or Republicans,” Gonzalez said. “A phone call from a constituent, an ally of an undocumented person, goes a long way, especially if you’re a student at Georgetown.”
The incertitude around DACA has also led community organizers to speak out in favor of another piece of legislation, the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, also known as the DREAM Act. Originally introduced by Durbin in 2001, the bill was most recently reintroduced with bipartisan support, including Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski (COL ’80) from Alaska.
“In the highly contentious world of immigration policy, one of the least controversial propositions is that the children of undocumented individuals, who were brought to the United States by their parents and were educated here, should have the opportunity to pursue their dreams  in America,” Murkowski wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Along with members of Alaska’s faith community, I share the strong moral conviction that the Dreamers should be free from fear of deportation.”
Georgetown also created the full-time position of associated director for undocumented student services within the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access, hiring Arelis Palacios to fill the role. Palacios formerly served as a part-time undocumented student adviser through her position in the Office of Global Education.
Durbin’s remarks on the Senate floor that day were almost clairvoyant, as he echoed the concerns of many immigrants who now do not know if their information is safe.
“President Trump said to me ‘don’t worry about those kids,’” Durbin said. “Well, Mr. President, I continue to worry about these kids, I continue to worry about those kids every day.”
But when asked about advocacy, what Gonzalez really wishes is to have a conversation with a Trump supporter.
“I’m very optimistic that that would make a difference, … find the things that we have in common, the love that we have for this country,” Gonzalez said. “At the end of the day I think we have more things in common than we think, but we never hear about the conversations happening between both sides.”

Georgetown completed a series of renovations to dining and student life facilities this summer, including major changes to O’Donovan Hall and the Leavey Center, increasing the number of outlets offering meal exchange options.
Changes include a renovation of Sellinger Lounge, Hoya Court and the university bookstore to open up the first floor of the Leavey Center and new food vendors Chick-fil-A and salad shop Crop Chop to replace Subway, Elevation Burger and Salad Creations. While Chick-fil-A does not accept meal swipes, Crop Chop does.
Changes to Leo’s include updates to the top and bottom floors, a new central staircase with stadium seating on each side and an all-you-care-to-eat space on the bottom floor operated by the Fresh Food Company. Six separate meal exchange locations now accept meal swipes and flex dollars on the upper floor.
Associate Vice President for Auxiliary Business Services Joelle Wiese said the planned renovations were all completed on time, but not all locations are operating at full capacity due to some outstanding logistical and staffing needs, including a required training period for Chick-fil-A employees.
As a result, lines and waiting time at Leo’s have been an issue for many students. According to Chief Business Officer Debby Morey, the university expects a period of adjustment for dining staff and employees.
Morey said since the entire renovation was completed in a short amount of time, some minor issues are visible.
“To change what we have changed over two and a half months is normally six to eight months. There are tweaks here and there,” Morey said.
In addition, Morey said the university is actively monitoring wait times to anticipate any future problems.
“We are viewing this as a stabilizing period because everything is so new,” Morey said. “We have folks who are actually timing students in line.”
Director of Business Operations of Auxiliary Business Services Loren Sumerlin said the extension of operating hours at Bulldog Tavern facilitates the use of meal exchanges.
“Last year we just had one a day during a specific timeframe. Now you have three [meal exchanges] a day on your meal plan and it is available in essence from open to close,” Sumerlin said. “There is almost 20 hours to 18 hours a day that a meal exchange option is available on campus.”
A significant change for the lower level of Leo’s is the transition away from a self-serve model. Employees now directly serve and prepare meals instead of carting the meals onto a hot plate. Weise said the university has the ability to convert some food stations into self-serving stations to account for increased traffic.
“We are trying to fluctuate the quality of the food with the business volume that we have,” Wiese said.
Georgetown University Student Association Deputy Chief of Staff Zac Schroepfer (MSB ’19) said the new configuration allows food to be prepared in front of the student and addresses past concerns regarding the quality and freshness of the food.
“Now the food is being prepared directly in front of the student. It is fresher and in my opinion and in many others’ opinions, higher quality food,” Schroepfer said. “What this also leads to is longer wait times.”
In addition, Wiese said food at self-serving stations can get cold and deteriorate in quality when Leo’s experiences low traffic.
According to GUSA Dining Chair Mark Camilli (COL ’19), larger issues with campus dining’s new renovations are attributed to employees adjusting to the change and should be resolved in the next month.
“These restaurants are brand new so you know getting used to the menus, getting used to what the orders are, so in a couple of weeks some of the kinks will be worked out,” Camilli said.
One issue many students have noticed is the positioning of sneeze guards at the edge of the Leo’s salad bar, impeding access to ingredients.
Morey said this obstacle was due to improper installation of sneeze guards and that the office is working to replace the sneeze guards.
“This is a source of frustration for us because we are not understanding why the sneeze guards are taking so long to get to us,” Morey said.
The Uncommon Grounds coffee shop also moved to the second floor of the bookstore and the Chick-fil-A in Hoya Court is expected to start offering breakfast and dinner menu options once employees have been properly trained in a few weeks.
Young Yun (MSB ’20) said though physical renovations are visually pleasing, the taste has not improved.
“I haven’t really noticed a change in food to be honest. Upstairs food, the lines are a little long at the start, but pretty good now,” Yun said. “Overall, it is good food. I am not sure it is worth 14 or 16, whatever they charge.”

The Georgetown University Student Association and university administration are planning a series of new initiatives to make the university’s campus and surrounding areas friendlier to bicycle riders, including distributing free helmets to riders and creating a bicycle lane next to the Georgetown University MedStar Hospital.
GUSA has been collaborating with the designers of the new wing of the Georgetown University MedStar Hospital and the administration to integrate an exclusive lane for bicycles next to the green space that will be located outside the building. A bike lane is now included in the preliminary plan for the site, according to GUSA Vice President for Transportation Policy Jack Pelose (COL ’19).
“We believe that a bike path in north campus would be a valuable addition to Georgetown because it would separate bike traffic from pedestrian traffic, improving safety for both groups, and encourage biking in the Georgetown community,” Pelose wrote in an email to The Hoya.
To further promote bike safety, the Georgetown Office of Sustainability has partnered with Coca-Cola to distribute 500 bike helmets this academic year, according to Sustainability Programs Coordinator Greg Miller (SFS ’14).
Additionally, GUWellness will sponsor a “Bike Commuting 101” class every month to teach commuters how to get around Washington, D.C.
Despite being recognized by the League of American Bicyclists as a Bronze-level Bicycle Friendly University since 2013, the university can still improve accessibility and safety for bicycle riders, according to Pelose.
“There are things we can improve with biking. I think that the Georgetown neighborhood is hard because a lot of it is brick and stone, which is hard to bike around, and there’s not a lot of good ways lining our sidewalks for bikes on-campus or in the neighborhood at all,” Pelose said.
The D.C. metropolitan area has been an outlier in the national trend of rising yearly bicycle crash fatalities, according to a report this August by the Governor’s Highway Safety Association, using data from 1994 and 2015.
According to an email from the Washington Metropolitan Police Department, bicycle crash fatalities in Washington, D.C. have oscillated between one and two accidents per year in the last five years.
Pelose and Miller said the Georgetown neighborhood is relatively safe due to the prevalence of small roads that force drivers to slow down, but they also acknowledged that cobblestone streets and the intersection of M Street and Wisconsin Avenue are potentially dangerous.
The administration studied these roads and their usage in 2016 as part of the planning for the long-term campus development plan.
“We don’t have bicycle crash fatality data for the Georgetown neighborhood in particular, but as part of the campus plan process in 2016, Georgetown did do an exhaustive study about transportation in the Georgetown neighborhood,” Pelose said.
According to Pelose, the university tracked the number of cars and bikes at various intersections around the neighborhood in order to determine where the two are most likely to intersect.
Vice President of Facilities Management Robin Morey wrote in an email statement to the Georgetown community that the university has integrated this information into the master plan and aims to achieve a Silver designation as a Bicycle Friendly University this year.
“The University’s master plan also emphasizes pedestrian and bicycle-friendly development over the next 20 years,” Morey wrote.
In 2015, the administration declared the campus a “pedestrian core,” limiting speed limits on campus to 15 miles per hour and integrating mechanisms like speed bumps to slow traffic, according to Morey.
Georgetown University Police Department Chief of Police Jay Gruber recommends that riders also take responsibility for their own safety.
“Riding a bicycle in an urban environment takes full-time attention and adherence to all traffic laws,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In addition to wearing helmets, riders should obey traffic laws and should never wear headphones or earbuds while riding.”

Three Georgetown University schools are kicking off the academic year with refreshed leadership, as the McDonough School of Business, the Georgetown College and the School of Foreign Service in Qatar welcome new deans.
Christopher S. Celenza started as the dean of the College on July 1, leaving his post as vice provost for faculty affairs at Johns Hopkins University. Celenza also served as a professor in the German and Romance languages and classics departments at Johns Hopkins.
Celenza said he is looking to balance maintaining Georgetown’s traditions with a need to prepare students for an uncertain future.
“On the one hand, the basic experience of the College for Georgetown students is one that really prepares them for life in a specific way, which is to say it can give you the sorts of tools that you can resituate yourself,” Celenza said in an interview with campus media. “We have to be willing and courageous enough to think that we can’t only do something just because we’ve always been doing it.”
University President John J. DeGioia announced Celenza’s appointment in a campuswide email March 2.
Paul Almeida became dean of the MSB, taking the reins from interim Dean Rohan Williamson. Williamson’s tenure started last August after the resignation of the school’s former dean of five years, David Thomas.
Ahmad S. Dallal takes over as dean of the SFS-Q on Sept. 1. Formerly a history professor at the American University in Beirut from 2009 to 2015, he succeeds former SFS-Q Dean James Reardon-Anderson, who had announced he would step down one year earlier than scheduled in July.
Dallal also served as chair of Georgetown’s Arabic and Islamic Studies department from 2003 to 2009. His work has focused on both past and present Islamic culture. He has published three books and over 40 articles on the history of Islamic thought and law, and has also served as an adviser to the planning committee of the primary exhibition at the National September 11 Memorial and Museum in New York City.
Dallal said he will look to strengthen SFS-Q’s existing presence in Qatar and seek paths to expansion.
“I hope to build on and continue the great work that the former deans have accomplished on two key fronts — anchoring Georgetown Qatar within the larger landscape of higher education in the country and the region and maintaining the academic excellence of current programs while exploring possibilities of future program expansion,” Dallal said in a university press release.
Almeida has been with the university in various capacities for more than two decades, most recently as a deputy dean for executive education, where he headed the school’s six executive graduate programs. His recent work also includs leading the school’s Innovation Initiative, which has sought to better integrate technology, organization and Jesuit values with the school’s curriculum.
Almeida also co-founded the internationally focused Global Executive MBA program, a collaboration among the MSB, SFS and business schools in Spain and Costa Rica.
“Paul is known throughout our academic community as a respected scholar and teacher who is deeply committed to our Catholic and Jesuit identity,” DeGioia wrote in an email announcing the appointment. “His research focuses on innovation, knowledge management, alliances, and information collaborations across firms and countries, and his work has been published in leading scholarly journals and books.”
