“You Eat Your Kids” and “Thank God For Dead Soldiers” were among the signs held high by four members of the Westboro Baptist Church in Washington Circle Thursday morning, a protest met by about 300 college students.
The counterprotesters, including a contingent from Georgetown, were there in opposition to Westboro’s stance against gays and current American foreign policy.
“Something needed to be said back in response to them, saying, `You’re wrong, dead soldiers is not a blessing,'” counterprotester Marisa Tersy (SFS ’14) said. “Especially since the protest was [targeted at The George Washington University, to protest the liberal leanings of the university] and also toward our generation [.] as students we need to say what we feel back to them.”
Student protesters from GWU formed a large part of the Veterans Day demonstration.
“We thought it would be a great idea to do a counterprotest, to show our support for veterans and to show that we condemn any acts of bigotry,” said Erin Mew, editor-at-large of the GW Patriot, which helped organize the protest.
The Westboro Baptist Church, based in Topeka, Kan., is known for its extreme religious beliefs. The church regularly pickets at funerals of members of the military and murdered gays, both of whom they do not believe deserve commemoration, and has also held protests at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in D.C.
“It’s crazy that people can act like this and the world might not know about it,” said Armes Vito, a senior at GWU. “It’s just absolutely horrendous, so I couldn’t let them come here without protesting.”
The Westboro picketers at Thursday’s protest held signs, wore American flags and gay-pride flags tied around their feet so that they trailed on the ground and shared heated exchanges with the student protesters.
“God doesn’t use bad words,” one counterprotester shouted at the Westboro picketers.
“Like `hate,’ and `I abhor your very image,’ is that a bad word? God hates you,” Westboro member Rebecca Phelps-Roper responded. “We’re here because your destruction is imminent, because you are still living you have a chance to repent.”
Students were vocal in their opposition to Westboro’s points of contention, periodically breaking out into chants of “It’s not working,” and “I’m gay for today.”
Despite heated conversation, the protests were peaceful. The protests were supervised by about a dozen police officers, who ensured that students stayed on the north side of Washington Circle, the only area for which they had a permit. A small group of Georgetown students were also in attendance. Some students, including Kaitlin Carano (COL ’13), said they felt that responding to the pickets only served to feed the fire of protest, however.
“If it weren’t for the fact that there are these protests…nobody would know about these people,” she said. “They would have no voice, and we give them a voice by going and showing that we somehow care what they’re saying.”
Tersy disagreed.
“The protest was important,” she said. “They can picket, and that that’s their right, but it’s our right too…Something needed to be done.”

A Village A apartment was burglarized on Tuesday evening, less than a week after the Department of Public Safety implemented new security measures following a string of similar burglaries.
On Tuesday, a student reported that upon returning to his apartment at 9 p.m. he found that his apartment had been burglarized and his laptop stolen, according to a Public Safety Alert sent to the campus community Wednesday afternoon.
Between Oct. 16 and Oct. 31, four burglaries and an attempted burglary occurred in Village A. Following the incidents, DPS increased night patrols and monitoring of overnight vehicular access to campus. DPS has also promised to provide personal safety consultations for Village A residents and set up brighter lighting features.
According to DPS Associate Director Joseph Smith, the latest burglarty is not indicative of a deficiency in the new measures.
“Any countermeasures against burglary, it’s not an absolute panacea for the problem. It doesn’t mean that we can [prevent] every single incident,” Smith said. “By increasing patrols and increasing the lighting, we’re reducing the risk factor, but there’s always a risk unless we put a DPS officer inside every single apartment.”
According to university spokeswoman Julie Bataille, DPS is not ruling out implementing further measures, but Smith said that he believes the current measures will largely be effective despite the most recent crime.
“We examine the available data and we ask ourselves: Do we need to modify our tactical plan? Do we keep it as is?” Smith said. “[The security measures are] not something that will have an immediate effect, but I believe that over time, we will see a dramatic difference in the amount of incidents in Village A.”
The measures were implemented after burglaries occurred in Village A on Oct. 16, Oct. 21 and Oct. 26. In each instance, a laptop was stolen from the targeted apartment. In an attempted burglary on Oct. 30, a student walking back to her Village A apartment was followed by an unknown suspect who attempted to force his way into the apartment but was stopped by another student and fled. On Oct. 31, a student returned to her Village A apartment to find a burglar in the apartment; the burglar fled without removing anything.

Another tight budget for the Student Activities Commission forced the organization to approve 72.5 percent of the $122,755 student organizations requested during the first run of its new bulk allocation system. SAC currently has $5,578 to allocate for the rest of the semester. Anything left over will roll over into next semester.
“Our budget has generally flatlined over the past three years,” said Harrison Holcomb (NHS ’11), vice chair of SAC.
The finalized and approved budgets for each group will now be faced with an across-the-board 27.5 percent cut in their allocations to keep SAC within the confines of its budget.
This decrease is significant. The International Relations Club’s funding amount before the change, according to SAC commissioner Ruiyong Chen (SFS ’13), was $15,846. That amount has decreased to $11,488.35 with the new cuts. In the 2009 fiscal year, the IRC received $18,733.10.
On Monday, SAC formalized its funding allocations for the coming semester. A total of $89,000 was awarded to its member organizations. $77,000 came from SAC’s general budget, and SAC decided it would reclaim an additional $12,000 from fall semester to help minimize the reductions necessary to accommodate last spring’s large requests. The commission held back $3,000 for its contingency fund.
Last spring, SAC was able to dole out around $80,000 to groups so they could put on events, hold meetings and promote their organizations.
Although this year’s budget is a slight increase of 1.5 percent in the approval rate over last year, strained budgets have been a theme for SAC in recent years as the amount of money the body has on hand to allocate has held level while general costs have been on a steady rise.
Gas prices, food costs and rental service fees have all been trending upwards. For example, the cost of having Department of Public Safety officers at an event, which is required in a number of instances such as if cash will be collected, soared this summer. On July 1 the hourly rate for each officer jumped from $23.75 to $40.25.
But budget woes are only half the story of this semester’s allocation rounds.
New policies – which represent the first major overhaul to SAC funding regulations since 1992 – have changed the status quo for how the money will be divvied up among the groups and their desired events.
Under the old system, groups put forth ideas and budgets on an event-by-event basis and whatever money they received had to be used for those specific events, with minor exceptions and flexibilities.
Now groups put forth entire semester budgets, known as funding arcs, for which they still provide specific event proposals but are allocated money in a bulk system. This allows groups to organize and spend that money across events as they see fit, so long as all events adhere to a basic quality level put forth in the groups’ initial proposal.
The new guidelines have been generally heralded by groups as a positive move, but the new regulations, to some degree, have tilted and adjusted which events get favored and which get marginalized.
Overall, groups feel these new policies are seeing large-scale items suffer while giving groups more flexibility and opportunity when it comes to smaller events.
This means more freedom for groups to decide how much to spend on each of the events it promised SAC it would host but less for top-dollar engagements.
“It’s good in some ways and bad in others,” said Vanessa Radelmiller (COL ’11), president of Club Filipino, about SAC’s new allocation system.
She said her organization enjoys the increased wiggle room and decreased bureaucracy the new system promotes.
But it has put the fate of the group’s largest event of the year, Bayanihan, in jeopardy and forced club leaders to look elsewhere for additional funding.
“We’ve been thinking about other options, other grants like the Re-Imagine Georgetown Grant,” Radelmiller said.
But the group remains skeptical about whether they would get all of the money necessary to put a show on with the same kind of spark as they had in the past.
“It’s been hard,” said Radelmiller, on what she and other longtime group members are feeling. “We’ve had to swallow our pride a bit.”
Overall, though, she thought the new format helped in some areas, like recruiting and organizing smaller events.
“It definitely makes it so much easier to do little things,” she said.
Chen believes the new pressure on groups to fundraise independently is not a downside and that the new freedoms with how the money is spent should not have major effects on big-ticket events.
“SAC allocates a bulk budget to the groups. . If they get allocated more money for a small event that doesn’t need as much, the group is empowered to use the remainder of the funds on another larger event,” Chen said.
Holcomb gave some credit to groups like Club Filipino that felt the new rules were affecting larger events.
“[Groups] might see more money for movie nights,” Holcomb said. “But major events are probably going to feel more pressure.”
Another organization, the International Relations Club, which pushed for the new system and supports it, has been adjusting and weighing out its pros and cons.
“At its most basic level, bulk allocation has been something that the IRC supported,” said Eitan Paul (SFS ’12), the chair of the IRC.
With well over 200 members, the IRC is one of the largest student groups on campus and has welcomed the decreased level of bureaucracy and oversight.
While the IRC still relies on SAC for a majority of its funding, the stakes may be smaller for this well-established and well-connected organization that says it has other outlets, such as the School of Foreign Service dean’s office, for help with funding its largest events.
While Paul said the system still has some kinks to be worked out, he said he likes the new changes.
“We definitely favor there being a bulk allocation system,” he said.
The shift in SAC’s budget screening and allocation process stemmed from groups’ responses to a joint Georgetown University Student Association and SAC-sponsored survey from last year. A large majority pushed for bulk allocation, and the decreased restrictions and hassles that come with it, and a large number of stakeholders are optimistic about the changes.
With or without a new funding system, SAC’s budget will most likely be under a tight squeeze into the foreseeable future.
“The reality of the situation is that SAC cannot fund all of the events that groups request,” Chen said.”

The French department and the Office of Residence Life are hammering out plans for Georgetown’s first on-campus language floor, which may be housed on Copley Hall’s ground level next year.
Named the Dorothy M. Betz French Floor, the funding for the living community was donated by professor emeritus Paul Betz of the English department in memory of his wife Dorothy Betz, a French professor who died April 13 after a 38-year career at the university.
The floor would be open to 16 students interested in a greater exposure to French studies, language and culture. Professor Andrew Sobanet, chair of the French department, has been in talks with Residence Life about the feasibility of the project; Copley ground floor has been designated the leading possibility for the francophone living environment.
Sobanet said Paul Betz’s gift would help finance activities on the floor each year. From individual and group language instruction and practice, greater contact with the French Embassy and more interaction with French exchange students, the floor would also be a forum for cultural interaction. Possibilities include French cooking classes and weekend getaways, according to Sobanet. Cooking crepes and all other French fun will be free for residents thanks to the generous fund.
“[The floor] will enhance the life of the French majors and minors. . It will improve their language skills and cultural exposure,” Sobanet said.
While Sobanet did not know of any other language floors in the works, he hopes the addition of the French floor sparks other language departments to consider the option.
Applications for the floor are currently being accepted. So far, the opportunity has drawn nine applicants; priority is given to French majors and minors based on student seniority.
“I hope that as word spreads on how fun it is the demand will be high, thus increasing our
selectivity [by GPA] . I’m excited about it. As word of mouth spreads among French majors, it’ll be sought after” Sobanet said.
The floor stemmed from an idea Dorothy Betz had been pushing for many years in the French department. In her eulogy at Mrs. Betz’s funeral in Dahlgren Chapel last spring, Deborah Lesko Baker, a professor of French and former chair of the department, hinted that plans for a French floor could materialize in the future. Lesko Baker said at the time that if plans for a floor came to fruition, the floor ought to be named after the longstanding professor.
After hearing Lesko Baker’s eulogy, Paul Betz decided that he would like to contribute the financial backing necessary to see out his wife’s wish.
“I’m very pleased that this project, which meant so much to my wife who loved Georgetown, may take place,” he said. “Dorothy died so suddenly. It is something of a consolation to help out with some of the things she cared about.”
Betz is also donating funds to enhance the French department’s collection of French literature.

The number of early action applications rose by 7.9 percent this fall, Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon said Monday.
The Office of Undergraduate Admissions had counted 6,609 early applications for the class of 2015 as of Monday, up from 6,124 last year. Despite a Nov. 1 deadline for the early action cycle, Deacon estimated that the total would increase slightly as numbers are finalized. The admissions office has not yet released application totals for each of the four undergraduate schools.
Last fall, early action applications decreased 1.4 percent from those for the Class of 2013, but overall the university has seen an upward trend in the number of early applications over the past few years, Deacon said.
This year’s increase comes in spite of Georgetown’s decision not to “hyper-recruit” students as other institutions have done, Deacon said.
“There has been no change in strategy or policy to stimulate an increase,” Deacon said in an email.
Deacon described hyper-recruitment as a tactic colleges and universities used to lower their admissions rates by seeking to attract more applicants and thus seem more selective. In an April 2010 interview, Deacon told THE HOYA that Georgetown has no plans to adopt such a policy because it does not attract more qualified applicants; those applicants who are best suited to Georgetown apply regardless of its relative selectivity.
“Since we don’t [hyper-recruit], changes in our pool might be more reflective of any changes out there in how students are approaching college applications in the current climate,” Deacon said.
Georgetown’s increase, while substantial, is not among the highest increases in early applications among its peers. Early-decision applications for Northwestern University increased nearly 26 percent, The New York Times reported on Nov. 12. Among schools using an early action cycle, The University of Chicago reported an 18.5 percent increase in early applications, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology saw a 14.4 percent rise and Fordham University reported an 8 percent increase. Many other schools observe a Nov. 15 deadline for early applications.
The university announces early admissions results on Dec. 15. Georgetown’s early action program is non-binding and permits students to apply to early programs at other schools.

The same day as the most recent burglary in Village A, an Xbox was stolen from a dorm room in Copley Hall’s basement.
The burglary occurred on Nov. 9 between 3:30 p.m. and 6 p.m. The victim, Xander Robinson (SFS ’13), reported the incident on Nov. 10, at 2:30 p.m., according to a Public Safety Alert sent to the campus community Thursday afternoon.
The burglar entered the dorm room through an unlocked door. Robinson, who had left the residence at 3:30 p.m., returned to his dorm room at 6 p.m., only to realize that an Xbox was missing.
“I was late to practice so I just ran out of my room because I couldn’t find the key. [At first] I thought it was a prank,” Robinson said.
Robinson said that there were several other electronic items as well as $100 in cash in the room left untouched. He finally reported the incident after none of his friends reported knowing of the Xbox’s whereabouts.
Robinson said that he had left the Robinson said that he had left the room unlocked several times before and had previously assumed Copley to be a safe location.
“I did not think that something like this would happen to me because [all of the thefts happening are in] Village A and Copley is so secure,” he said. “I feel a little less secure now. I make sure my stuff is secure and lock my door every time now.”
There are currently no leads on the suspect. Joseph Smith, associate director of the Department of Public Safety, was unavailable for comment.

The Georgetown policy debate team’s ninth-place national ranking marks a return to heights last seen in the late 1970s, with much of the program’s success owed to Richard Day (SFS ’14) and Andrew Markoff (SFS ’14) – the only two-person, all-freshman team to be ranked within the top-25 teams in the country.
“This is the highest Georgetown has been in over a decade. . It’s really kind of a resurgence for the team,” Debate Director Jonathan Paul said.
With over 350 two-person debate teams across the country, any chance of coming out of competition ahead requires hours upon hours of research and preparation. Taking stock of the level of competition his program has reached, Paul estimated the team typically spends 30 to 40 hours a week on debate – and that does not include the amount of class time they miss to go to tournaments.
“I recruit these people in high school,” Paul said. “When they get in and decide to come, they are very much committed to debate.”
And some students applied to Georgetown with debate on their minds.
“I wanted to debate in college and I only was applying to schools that had good debate programs,” Day said.
Georgetown’s debate program, storied for its domination from 1973 to 1980 when Georgetown captured the national Copeland Award five times – equivalent to a No. 1 national ranking – and reached second and third national rankings in the time period as well. According to Tom Rollins (COL ’78), an active alumnus in the program who was voted the best debater of the 1970s, Debate Coach Jim Unger was the driving force behind the decorated team Georgetown had at the time. On his end, Unger was voted best debate coach for that decade.
After Unger left Georgetown, the program fell into disarray, according to Rollins. A lack of funding led to a decline in talent that only started to bounce back three years ago.
Following Unger’s death in April 2008, Rollins and Loren Danzis, a fellow debate student of Unger, executed his estate, for the pair had been tending to their mentor in his later years. In his will, Unger left a set amount of money for the advancement of debate teams nationally, so Rollins and Danzis set up the James J. Unger Memorial Fund for Georgetown Debate with all of the funds.
Rollins and several other alumni donated to the fund, which enabled Georgetown to hire current Director Jonathan Paul. Paul, an alumnus of Northwestern University, debate giant of the 1990s and 2000s, was quite the catch, Rollins said.
“No program does well without a world-class coach. We were so lucky to find [Paul]. . We got this guy and he had come from this fabulous program,” Rollins said.
Rollins also described the close bond that he formed with Unger and the hopes he had for his current team.
“A debate coach shapes you like no one else in your life besides your parents. He will make a fabulous mark on the lives of his debaters as Jim Unger did for me,” Rollins said.
Paul came in with lofty goals for revitalizing the program at Georgetown. Back when he first began speaking with Rollins about the program’s future, he told Rollins about a standout recruiting prospect: Andrew Markoff, a promising high school sophomore from the Bronx High School of Science.
By the end of his high school career, Markoff was ranked the No. 3 debater in the country; Day, his current teammate, was ranked first. Though the two competitors were arch rivals in their high school years, they managed to form a close friendship as contenders at competitions nationwide.
When it came to make their pick for their academic and debate futures, they both said they wanted to play a role in revitalizing a college debate program.
“The team here was kind of dead. . It seemed like a fun opportunity to start on a young team,” Markoff said.
The debate team has suffered some turnover from members studying abroad or graduating. With four freshmen and two sophomores on board, the program is young.
“It was a struggle for the first couple years, and it’s nice to see it all happening,” Paul said.
After the first few years of hard work, Rollins said he sees the program regaining its once-faded prestige.
“[Day and Markoff are] dream-team material. . The only people that beat them are the top teams in the country,” he said.
There are currently six active members on the debate team; participants partner up to compete in teams of two. Each year across the country, debate season begins in July when topics are released. Topics typically focus on government policy, and this year’s topic focuses on whether the U.S. government should alter its immigration policy to increase legal immigration.
“We’ve got an interesting topic, and I’ve liked who I’m working with and what I’m working on,” Day said.
The work begins before school starts. This year the team arrived Aug. 2 to kick off research on their topics. Working from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. in the highly coveted final days of summer was the ultimate bonding experience, according to Markoff.
Rollins said of the extensive time commitment, “There are only a certain amount of hours you can train for a sport, but there is no limit to the amount of work you can do for debate.”
Both Day and Markoff stressed the importance of the team atmosphere and value for their coaching staff.
“We all just really enjoy what we do. … It’s a really good atmosphere. … Georgetown debate has been great because we all try really hard and have each other’s backs,” Markoff said.
Markoff recalled the team’s latest tournament at Harvard University, which is considered the most difficult regular season faceoff and only invites the nation’s best 76 teams. Before the elimination rounds, the entire rest of the team stayed up all night to finish researching. They did this so that Day and Markoff could get the sleep they needed before the competition the next morning. Day and Markoff advanced to the octo-finals, or Sweet 16, after earning a 6-2 record in the preliminary debate rounds.
“The only way you succeed is with the support of your teammates and coaching staff,” Day said.
At that tournament, Day and Markoff took down teams from Harvard, Emory University and the No. 3 ranked team from the University of California, Berkeley. And the duo of boy wonders was the first team of two freshmen to advance to the elimination rounds at the tournament since 1992.
“It’s really cool to be competitive on the national debate circuit . but it’s pretty awesome to be bringing this legacy back to Georgetown,” Day said.
This year’s team has a chance to make it to the National Debate Tournament, which only invites about 70 teams. Rollins and Paul were both optimistic about the team’s chances.
“If these two men [Day and Markoff] stay with it for the rest of their college eligibility, they could be the greatest Georgetown debate team of all time. This kind of success for freshmen is off the charts. . If they stick with it they could be talked about for decades,” Rollins said.
**Correction: Loren Danzis was originally identified as Loren Dangis.**”

Patrick Eronini (NHS ’12) downplayed his meeting Monday with Georgetown basketball legend Dikembe Mutombo (SLL ’91) and the reason behind it.
“I was pleasantly surprised,” said Eronini, who was informed about the visit just days before. Mutombo and the Merage Foundation for the American Dream awarded Eronini a scholarship this summer for his academic and service achievements.
“I thought it was pretty cool,” Eronini said of Mutombo’s visit. “It was kind of fun. He’s fairly laid-back and he’s funny. He’s a kind person so it was an enjoyable experience.”
He added, “He talked about how he felt like every time he comes back to Georgetown, the campus seems to be changing and getting bigger and bigger, but in a positive way.”
The Merage Foundation’s stated mission is “[helping] immigrants become leaders in their communities and in the nation . The Foundation’s hope is that increasing numbers of immigrants will be able to reach their own and their family’s aspirations.”
Eronini said he wasn’t really sure why he was chosen, but Daniel Porterfield, senior vice president for strategic development, supported Eronini.
“His impact is enormous. He is a student leader. Other students come to Georgetown, and they enjoy their time more because of him,” Porterfield said.
Eronini, the son of Nigerian parents, was born in England, moved to Texas when he was 7, and grew up in Maryland.
“It makes it easier for me to relate to people somehow,” Eronini said. “I’m open to other people’s views and experiences because I’ve been all over.”
Relating to others and serving the community have been the guiding principle of Eronini’s time at Georgetown.
Porterfield met Eronini at a dinner he held during a pre-orientation program.
“I could tell from that first meeting that he was extremely thoughtful,” Porterfield said.
He asked Eronini to intern in his office the next summer and selected him to be one of three peer mentors for a new summer program as part of Georgetown’s involvement with the Cristo Rey Network, a group of Catholic schools serving economically disadvantaged students.
Eronini also served on the President’s Initiative on Diversity and Inclusiveness and the Georgetown ALLIES, coordinates Hoya Saxa Weekend and co-founded the Minority Health Initiative Group.
One of the programs Eronini is most proud of being involved in is Hoya Saxa Weekend, which helps bring under-represented minorities to campus during Georgetown Admissions Ambassador Program weekend. Last year, the program sponsored 69 students.
“I came to [Hoya Saxa Weekend] when I was admitted, so it’s really important to me,” Eronini said. “It lets students see what college is like, and allows them to get their feet wet and forge connections before starting so they can make greater contributions when they are here.”
Porterfield said Eronini is like a big brother to students he mentors.
“Part of his role is to bring out the best in others,” he said.
Eronini’s interest in medicine stems from the same source – a desire to help people.
“It allows me to solve complicated problems and work with individuals at the same time,” he said.
After graduating next year, Eronini said he wants to get a master’s degree in public health in addition to going to medical school with the hope of working in international health.”

The Corp’s new milkshakes are F’Real.
After debuting just a few weeks ago, the quick-mix F’Real milkshakes and smoothies, which are offered in Vital Vittles, have become hugely popular on the Hilltop.
“Students on campus seem very excited about the new product, as are we,” Vital Vittles Director Caitlyn Fredrick (NHS ’11) said.
According to Brad Glasser (COL ’11), CEO of The Corp, Frederick found and proposed the opportunity to work with F’Real, which seemed to fit in perfectly with Vittles’ products and space.
“Something we try to do is always stay on the lookout for products that will work for our existing services,” Glasser said.
The milkshakes sold well from the start, and according to Glasser, The Corp had to reorder to keep up with the demand.
“I couldn’t give you exact numbers, but certainly initially we sold out and had to increase our orders,” he said. “We’re trying to keep the fridge full.”
F’Real is an on-the-go milkshake company that enables its customers to choose from several flavors and then to mix the milkshake themselves using the easy four-step machine. Customers are offered three thickness options, “Less,”Regular” and “Extra.” While the company maintains old-time standards like vanilla, it also offers more interesting flavors like Reese’s and cookies and cream.
Yesterday, The Corp offered a tasting in Red Square in order to advertise the options available to students.
“Turnout, from our reports, was fantastic,” Glasser said. “I think personally they taste great, although it was a little chilly [outside].”
Uncommon Grounds, the Corp service nearest Vital Vittles, does offer its own blended smoothies, and the new F’Real products could pose a threat to UG’s market, but The Corp does not expect to see much internal competition. When asked about the possibility of one product beating out the other, Frederick said that it was unlikely.
“The prospect of cannibalization was something that was considered, but ultimately we believe that the two can coexist,” she said.
Asked about the possibility of a machine installation in Hoya Snaxa, Glasser said that may not be viable, at least not right now.
“It’s a very bulky operation with fairly unique utility requirements,” he said.
Either way, students are gobbling up the milkshakes, and The Corp only expects to see greater sales going forward.
Ben Kussman (SFS ’12) channeled plenty of student opinions as he commented on his smoothie between spoonfuls.
“It’s pretty good. Yeah. I’m not going to lie,” he said.

A study conducted in part at the Medical Center’s Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center found that screening former and current smokers with a CT scan can reduce lung cancer deaths by 20 percent, according to a university press release.
“The bottom line for this study is that these results are very encouraging. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in this country,” Claudine Isaacs, the lead investigator in Georgetown’s part of the study, said in the release.
“[There is more to be done in] figuring out how to implement the findings in the community, and to determine the actual cost-benefit ratio – in other words, will the number of lives saved be justified by the expense of conducting these scans?” said Louis Weiner, director of the Lombardi Center.
As part of the study, a CT scan was compared to a standard chest X-ray. The study found that a larger number of lung cancer deaths occurred in patients who had received an X-ray than those who had received CT scans.
“Potentially, we could save thousands of lives with CT screening, but . we could save hundreds of thousands more if people wouldn’t smoke or quit if they do,” Isaacs said in a university press release.
Georgetown was one of 33 testing sites around the country where the study was conducted. Over 1,800 smokers between the ages of 55 and 74 were involved in the study at Georgetown.
“Studies like these generate so much excitement, but clearly there is much more work to be done,” Weiner said in a release.

With many graduates struggling to find jobs, the Law Center has announced that it is extending its program, giving stipends to graduates participating in internships for public interest organizations.
The program provides students with $4,000 so that they can participate in law-related volunteer programs, according to Barbara Moulton, assistant dean of the Office of Public Interest and
Community Service at the Law Center. Started this summer, the program has now been extended for three more months in order to aid graduates still unable to find jobs.
The program is not advertised on the Law Center’s website, but has been announced to Law School students via an email. Currently it is only available to members of the Class of 2010 who are unemployed.
OPICS will only distribute the stipends to students whose
internships with the volunteer organizations last for at least three months. The graduate must also continue to look for permanent employment in order to receive the stipend.
The program comes at a bleak time for law school graduates: While 88 percent of law school graduates of the Class of 2009 were employed by May 2010, 25 percent of the jobs reported are temporary, according to The National Association for Legal Career Professions, a higher percentage than earlier years. Another 10 percent of the jobs reported are half-time.

Georgetown must submit its proposal for the 2010 Campus Plan to the D.C. Zoning Commission by Dec. 31, but as neighborhood talks stall, the future of university expansion remains uncertain.
Over the past year, Georgetown officials have repeatedly stated that they wish to work with the neighborhood in creating an amenable plan, but as of the beginning of November all talks have been put on hold, according to The Georgetown Dish.
All three of the primary neighborhood bodies in the area – the Citizens Association of Georgetown, the Burleith Citizens Association and the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E – have suspended discussion of the plan, which the university must develop for city approval every 10 years.
While neighborhood approval is not crucial to the passage of the plan, it could certainly play a large role. The university and the Zoning Commission sparred over the 2000 Campus Plan and in resulting legal battles for three years – following neighborhood protests, the Zoning Commission forbade the university from increasing its enrollment cap. The university successfully sued the commission and the plan was approved without a seal on enrollment in 2003.
This cycle, the protests focus on a rise in graduate and nontraditional undergraduate students, such as commuters, students over 25, and veterans.
The university’s current version of the campus plan does not seek to increase the number of traditional undergraduates, but it will increase the number of nontraditional undergraduates by over 10 percent.
The university also plans to create more space for graduate students, allowing for more enrollment. In a letter to the neighborhood on July 6, Spiros Dimolitsas, senior vicepresident and CEO of the university, said that the majority of the new students will be enrolled in the School of Continuing Studies. Dimolitsas added in his letter that previous growth in the number of graduate students has not led to housing problems. Lenore Rubino, president of the Burleith Citizens Association, challenged that assertion.
“If the university really wanted to work with the community, to roll up their sleeves, they could have,” Rubino said in an interview with THE HOYA. Rubino said that student housing could be provided in satellite campuses throughout the D.C. metropolitan area, such as in Arlington.
A main point of contention has been a proposal for a 120-bed dormitory for graduate students in the center of the block that holds the restaurant 1789.
“We want them to build more housing on campus, but they want to build on the 1789 block, which the neighborhood does not want to build up,” Rubino said. “The university has the financial ability to [build new student residences], because they can get money through the bond market, as they’ve been doing for the Science Center.”
With residents gearing up to combat the campus plan in front of the Zoning Commission, Georgetown’s administration is attempting to finalize the plan.
“We’ve had conversations with the community for the past two years about our campus plan in an effort to understand and address issues important to our neighbors as we develop a plan that meets the university’s strategic needs for the next 10 years,” wrote university spokeswoman Julie Bataille in an email. “We are still working to finalize our plan and expect to file it with the city by the end of the year.”
According to Rubino, however, negotiations have not proceeded as planned.
“We’ll have to wait and see. I think we have a very strong case. We’ve proven that a number of organizations are behind us. The university needs to look at that, and negotiate in good faith,” Rubino said.
Bataille and the university’s primary facilitator for the campus plan, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, were unavailable for comment.”

(UWIRE) Scientists at Harvard and the University of California, San Diego, have provided evidence for the first time of a gene that plays a role in shaping an individual’s political beliefs.
The study, published last week in the October issue of The Journal of Politics, analyzed data from over 2,500 adolescents and found that a specific variation in a dopamine receptor gene normally associated with novelty-seeking can lead to more liberal political ideologies in an individual.
However, the variation in the gene known as DRD4 only displayed an association with political liberalism if the subjects had an active social life while growing up, according to the study.
The principal author of the study and professor of medical genetics and political science at UC San Diego, James Fowler, explained novelty-seeking can lead to highly individualistic behavior.
“If you also have an active social life, with people with different lifestyles and world views, you are much more likely to develop liberal views,” he added.
Fowler emphasized that the results of the study show how a combination of one’s environment and one’s genes determine political ideology, not simply one or the other.
“We studied the gene because we have already been studying the environment ad nauseam,” Fowler said, citing a multitude of studies linking political leanings to ethnicity, race, education and socioeconomic status. “This way of thinking assumes we are all blank slates, and that’s just not true.”
Fowler and his team members first drew on psychological studies indicating that among the five domains of personality – openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and stability – liberals tend to score high on openness. Because the methods used to measure openness on these tests were similar to those used to measure novelty-seeking, the researchers decided to focus on the DRD4 gene, Fowler said.
Fowler, who has also done extensive work on social networks, emphasized that this study is just the tip of the iceberg in the field of genopolitics.
“We are only explaining one half of 1 percent of the variation in political ideology,” he said. “This is not the only gene that matters.”

D.C.’s Mayor-elect Vincent Gray began this week to implement his comprehensive plan, announced during the mayoral campaign, to lower unemployment by increasing the amount of education and opportunities available in the District.
Gray also plans to overhaul several programs, remnants of the Fenty administration.
Gray’s plan, “Creating Real Economic Opportunity for All,” emphasizes reforming the Department of Employment Services, which has come under criticism by several government officials who say that the organization has created more summer jobs than long-term careers. This leads to short-term rates of high employment, but no long-term growth, according to officials.
Young D.C. residents are not wholly pleased by the proposed reforms, however. Many high school and college students looking to save money for future education fear that Gray’s elimination of the Summer Employment Program will hurt their chances of finding summer jobs, according to The Washington Post.
Gray’s administration also plans to revitalize already-existent organizations that cater to D.C.’s younger population such as the Workforce Investment Council, Hospitality High School and public charter schools, by altering the leadership and organization of the programs.
Gray also seeks to increase the number of jobs in the District by collaborating with the federal government. According to The Washington Post, Gray hopes that the creation of a Department of Homeland Security complex in Anacostia, an area in Ward 8 where more than 30 percent of people are unemployed, will stimulate job creation. In an interview with The Washington Post, Emily Durso, president of the Hotel Association of Washington, said that the complex will create about 22,000 new jobs, jumpstarting small businesses. Currently, an estimated 40,000 people are unemployed in D.C., according to The Washington Post.
Gray is receiving federal advice in forming and implementing his plans. Gray’s transition financial advisory team consists of Barbara Lang, president and CEO of the D.C. Chamber of Commerce, and Stephen Trachtenberg, former president of The George Washington University. The two have formerly collaborated on efforts to increase the number of small businesses in D.C. and neighborhood revitalization projects.

Readers will now be able to peruse D.C.’s most widely read newspaper on the go, as The Washington Post released an iPad application on Nov. 8, the latest in a trend of national newspapers making the jump to the tablet platform.
The application, available on iTunes, is currently free for all users. That will change next year, however; as of February 2011, subscribers will be charged 99 cents monthly for the application, while new subscribers will be charged $3.99 a month.
USA Today was the first daily newspaper to introduce an iPad application on April 3, the very day that the iPad was first released. The New York Times launched its own iPad application on Oct. 15.
The Washington Post’s new application allows users to access their accounts, articles, videos and photographs. Users are also able to link to stories read on the application to their Facebook and Twitter accounts. The application also allows readers to download stories and read them offline.
Not all reviews of the new application have been positive, however. The application is averaging 2.5 out of 5 stars on iTunes. Of 208 raters, only 50 gave the application a full five stars. Positive reviews praise its layout and easy navigation, but critics say that the application is cluttered with ads. Some users are also having difficulty using their existing accounts for the application, while others dislike having to subscribe to the Post in order to use it, according to reviews.
The Washington Post has released several applications for the iPhone in the past. The applications include “Football Insider” – for keeping up-to-date with sports news and the Redskins – and “D.C. Rider” for train times and Metro alerts.
The Post is not the only D.C. company taking advantage of new technology. Several other companies have also released applications for the Metro, restaurant guides and tourist travel information. D.C.’s Fox affiliate also released a WTTG Fox 5 News application that gives a roundup of local weather, videos and headlines.
