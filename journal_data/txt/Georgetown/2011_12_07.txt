Former Dean of the McDonough School of Business Ronald Smith died on Saturday in Winchester, Mass. Smith served as dean of the school from 1977 to 1986.
Under Smith’s leadership, the MSB developed its four curricular themes – global business, ethics, business and leadership.
The business school also launched the full-time Master’s of Business Administration and renovated Old North, its former home, during Smith’s term.
Smith was known for holding personal events for students, faculty and staff several times each year.
“Along with his wife, Betty, Dr. Smith is remembered by many for the warmth of his hospitality,” David Thomas, current dean of the MSB, wrote in an email announcing Smith’s death Wednesday. “In February, he would again open his home and invite the school’s faculty and staff to an annual Valentine’s Day party. ‘February needs a party,’ he once explained.”
Smith is remembered through the Ronald L. Smith Service Award, which is given to an MSB faculty or staff member at the Tropaia Ceremony held during graduation events each spring.
Smith left Georgetown to be the president of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, where he remained until 1996.
Smith is survived by his wife, Betty, and his children Evan (MBA/JD ’90), Deanna (COL ’88) and Kathy.
A memorial for Smith will be held Thursday at 2 p.m. in Old South Church in Boston.

Two offices in White Gravenor Hall were burglarized Tuesday morning, according to the Department of Public Safety.
In a public safety alert emailed to the university community today, DPS reported that a university employee returned to his office at 11:45 a.m. Tuesday and discovered that the office had been broken into and his laptop had been stolen. The employee had secured the office when he left work at 1 p.m. day before.
According to the alert, forced entry was made at one other office in the building but nothing was taken.
There are no known suspects in either burglary.
Representatives of DPS could not be reached for comment.
