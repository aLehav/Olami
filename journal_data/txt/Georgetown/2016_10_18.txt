One in four seniors in the School of Foreign Service has declared a foreign language minor since the SFS began recognizing foreign language minors this fall, with Arabic, Chinese, French and Spanish language courses remaining the most popular choices among students.
Eighty-six out of about 350 students in the Class of 2017 have formally submitted minor declarations, according to SFS Associate Dean and Director of Undergraduate Programs Mitch Kaneda.
Seniors remain the only SFS students able to minor in a foreign language, after a policy change announced last semester. The Class of 2018 and Class of 2019 will be able to declare language minors in future years.
Arabic minor declarations have increased to 49 from an average 15 to 20 minors. French minors jumped from 59 total declared students last fall to 95 this semester.
The policy change from April marked the first time the SFS has permitted minors in any subject outside the SFS undergraduate core.
Previously, students had to exclusively pursue majors in one of eight programs in addition to pursuing interdisciplinary certificates. Students are also required to pass a foreign language proficiency test.
The SFS Academic Council played a significant role in pressing for access to language minors, according to Kaneda.
“This is an example of student leadership and the act of students, faculty and deans working together, that made a real difference,” Kaneda wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Spanish and Portuguese Department Chair Gwen Kirkpatrick said the minors have not shifted enrollment numbers drastically as Spanish was already a popular language.
“I think it is still too early to know whether it will change enrollments. We usually have quite a few SFS students in upper-level courses and in the Barcelona and Quito summer programs, so I’m not sure a change will be noticeable initially,” Kirkpatrick wrote in an email to The Hoya. “But we are looking forward to having more SFS students in upper levels as they complete a minor.”
Kirkpatrick said the minor opportunity is part of the department’s work to diversify course offerings.
Professor of Spanish Cristina Sanz said many students enrolled in upper-level language courses declare minors since they have already taken required courses.
“We have always had a substantial number of SFS students in upper level courses,” Sanz wrote in an email to The Hoya. “To the fact that a few are now declaring a minor does not mean they wouldn’t have taken those courses anyways before the recent changes.”
The Italian department received nine new minors from the SFS, an increase from 23 students and the German department reported a 25 percent increase in enrollments, including a 50 percent increase in enrollment at the two highest course levels.
The German department was unable to provide exact enrollment numbers as of 2:30 a.m. Tuesday.
Chair of the German department Friederike Eigler said fluctuations are common in a small department, but believed the new minor options will appeal to more students.
“In a small department like German fluctuations in enrollments are quite common and causes are not always easy to identify,” Eigler wrote in an email to The Hoya. “However, it is likely that the significant enrollment increases at the higher course levels this fall semester are at least in part related to the new minor option for SFS students i.e., students who have taken German through the advanced level and need two additional upper level courses to fulfill the minor requirement for German.”
Chair of Arabic and Islamic studies Felicitas Opwis said she has noticed an increased number of first-level course enrollments.
“In general, enrollment numbers go up and down from year to year, and so it is hard to speak of trends yet. However, comparing the enrollment of SFS students from fall 2015 with those of fall 2016 (i.e. with the start of language minors in SFS), I notice that we have a strong increase in SFS students in the first level/beginning Arabic as well as in Spoken Arabic and Media Arabic,” Opwis wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The total number of students enrolled is consistent, according to Opwis.
“However, this is not the case for second and third level Arabic, where numbers are roughly the same or lower. The absolute number of SFS students enrolled in Arabic courses (language and post-language acquisition courses) is still almost the same,” Opwis wrote.
Taylor Oster (SFS ’17), an Arabic minor, said the new option also communicates language students’ work more easily to potential employers.
“I think a language minor demonstrates a little more clearly your study and devotion to a particular language in a way that proficiency may not necessarily express. You could take your proficiency test without ever actually studying at Georgetown,” Oster said. “It’s a little easier to explain what a minor is versus what a concentration is, and I think for an employer, it’s easier to explain what a minor is versus what a concentration is or what a concentration means.”
Oster said the minor option rewards students who have already taken several courses to achieve proficiency.
“I’ve been taking Arabic since freshman year and the specific requirements for an Arabic minor were basically all the classes I had taken or planned to take. I think it’s great that we have proficiency in the SFS — it’s a really unique thing that the SFS requires,” Oster said.

The university intends to plan for a tobacco-free campus by the 2017-18 academic year, according to Associate Vice President for Benefits and Chief Benefits Officer Charles DeSantis.
The Smoke Free Georgetown campaign, which was launched by Mac Williams (NHS ’17) and Georgetown University Student Association Senator Henry Callander (COL ’18) two weeks ago, surpassed the 300 signatures required for the GUSA senate to vote on the referendum proposal.
The senate vote is expected to take place Sunday.
If approved, a campuswide referendum would provide the university with students’ opinions, which would assist the university’s process of going smoke-free, according to DeSantis.
“A student vote would articulate the student position as well as assist in the governance process as it moves through our system of shared governance,” DeSantis wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The current main campus policy prohibits smoking in all indoor locations, including all residence hall rooms, apartments and townhouses. Those who choose to smoke must do so in designated outdoor areas and are responsible for proper disposal of cigarette ashes and butts.
The Georgetown University Medical Center is currently the only smoke-free area at Georgetown. The Georgetown University Law Center has specific smoking locations.
Since the launch of Smoke Free Georgetown, the petition has received endorsements from Georgetown Relay for Life and the cardiac health advocacy group Heroes for Hearts, according to the Smoke Free Georgetown Facebook page.
The petition aims to improve the quality of health in the campus community, following in the footsteps of other universities that have already enacted full smoking bans, according to Williams.
“We’re really trying to align the university with our peer institutions and really just trying to look out for the health of our peers, our faculty and any visitors to campus,” Williams said.
Jonathan Samet, a pulmonary physician and director of the University of Southern California’s Institute for Global Health, said decades of research have established clear links between exposure to secondhand smoke and various chronic illnesses.
“There is about 40 years of work on secondhand smoke and starting with adults it is clear that it is a cause of lung cancer, heart disease and stroke,” Samset said. “Smoking has far and away contributed to disease around the world than air pollution.”
Samset said smoking bans in areas including hospitals and schools have been shown to be beneficial for public health.
“It is clear that smoking bans benefit health of adults and there have been many different studies,” Samet said.
Georgetown University Relay for Life officially endorsed the Smoke Free Georgetown campaign Oct. 9.
According to the Co-President of Georgetown University Relay for Life Kayla Schmittau (NHS ’17), the decision to endorse stemmed from a common goal shared by GU Relay for Life and Smoke Free Georgetown.
“We decided to endorse the referendum because it aligns very well with our mission of trying to increase awareness and health education about cancer rates and secondhand smoke,” Schmittau said. “We decided it was very relevant that we push the campus to be smoke-free so that smoking doesn’t affect people who choose not to but are being put at risk by people who do smoke on campus.”
Students of Georgetown, Inc., which currently sells tobacco products at its storefronts Vital Vittles and Hoya Snaxa, has not explicitly endorsed the Smoke Free Georgetown campaign, but favors a campuswide referendum, according to The Corp President and CEO Taylor Tobin (COL ’17).
Tobin said The Corp is supporting a referendum in order to represent the views of all Georgetown students.
“Every Georgetown student is considered a stakeholder of The Corp. For these reasons, we seek to represent the interests of all members of our campus community,” Tobin said. “The Corp is in favor of a campuswide referendum to enable all students to have their voice heard on this vital campus issue.”
Tobacco smoke contains thousands of different compounds, each with potentially adverse effects on health, according to Samet. Samet said nonsmokers deserve to be protected from these compounds.
“The [Center for Disease Control] says there are 7,000 different compounds in tobacco smoke,” Samet said. “Those who don’t smoke should be free to breathe unpolluted air.”
Schmittau said she hopes GUSA will take appropriate action and hold a referendum on the matter if a majority of students support the smoking ban.
“We hope if the school shows that they support the movement to make Georgetown a smoke-free campus, that GUSA will respond accordingly to meet that desire of the campus and to be in line with the Georgetown values of caring for other people and caring for their health and trying to make time here better for everyone,” Schmittau said.
Hoya Staff Writer William Zhu contributed reporting.

It is vital that GUSA hears the concerns of international students and smokers through every step of the referendum process, particularly before this issue is opened up to the entire campus and the potential of a  “tyranny of the majority” sets in where the voices of small groups are drowned out. Thus, anyone with a strong opinion on the issue should attend a Senate meeting in the next few weeks to make a public comment, especially if they can’t attend the roundtable.

Ricardo Mondolfi says

If you want to make the personal choice to smoke, that’s fine – but you should be the only one suffering the consequences, not those around you. If you want to smoke, get off our campus.
SUPPORT A SMOKE-FREE CAMPUS!

Smoking is out. Everyone knows it’s detrimental to your health, so quitting is the way to go, not defending “your right” to harm yourself and those around you.

As the unemployment rate in Washington, D.C., continues to hover above the national average, Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) increased benefits for the unemployed in D.C.’s Unemployment Insurance program beginning Oct. 1, implementing the first change to the policy in over a decade.
According to the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, D.C. maintained a 6 percent unemployment rate in August, higher than the 4.9 percent national average during the same period, as reported Sept. 20. Overall, the District ranked 46th in terms of unemployment rates per state.
The new benefits affect individuals who lose employment due to layoffs or other factors beyond their control by boosting the maximum weekly benefit amount for eligible claimants from $359 to $425 for as long as 26 weeks, or up to $1,700 monthly for six months.
The changes further include a 14-percent increase in weekly benefit payouts for part-time workers in an effort to assist claimants holding part-time jobs.
The last adjustment in the policy occurred in 2005, when maximum weekly benefits were lifted from $309 to $359.
These gains coincide with Bowser’s push for a higher minimum wage, which resulted in the D.C. Council’s unanimous passage of a plan in June designed to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020. The current D.C. minimum wage is $11.50 an hour.
Legal Aid Society of the District of Columbia attorney Drake Hagner, who works for its Public Benefits Law Unit, said the expansion of benefits was long overdue as the District lagged behind other states in maximum weekly benefit amounts, placing 38th out of all states with unemployment benefit systems despite its relatively high living costs.
“It’s been far too long,” Hagner said. “The rate has been way, way too low especially given the costs of living in D.C. and the surrounding area, which is where most D.C. workers live.”
Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce Director of State Initiative Neil Ridley praised the change as unique among what other states are doing to provide longer-term benefits for their residents.
“Another key change is to ensure that most, if not all workers who qualify for UI benefits are going to receive up to 26 weeks if they need it,” Ridley said. “It’s not just about increasing the weekly benefits amount or adjusting it, it’s also this change in the number of weeks that most, if not all workers will become eligible for.”
Ridley also said that from its inception, the goal of D.C.’s Unemployment Insurance program was to increase the incomes of unemployed individuals to keep pace with the cost of living in the District.
“Obviously over time, the benefits need to be adjusted due to cost of living and just to make sure it continues to provide partial of the peoples’ living wages,” Ridley said. “D.C. is a city with a high cost of living to begin with.”
In an Oct. 5 press release, Bowser said the hike better aligns the District’s policy with neighboring states’ levels. Maryland provides $430 and Virginia $378 in maximum weekly benefits.
“My administration has fought together alongside workers to raise the minimum wage and now increase unemployment benefits for the first time in 11 years,” Bowser said. “This is a huge step toward ensuring District workers and their families are able to better take care of their basic needs while searching for their next employment opportunity.”
Sperling’s BestPlaces, a website that analyzes publishes a ranked cost-of -iving index, which factors in and weighs categories including housing, food and groceries, transportation and utilities. Washington, D.C.’s index, based on the national average of 100, came in at 154.
Professor of history Maurice Jackson said unemployment disproportionately impacts D.C.’s black community, which has an unemployment rate of 15.4 percent, more than double the average District rate in 2015. Jackson predicted that without higher unemployment benefits, more members of the black community would move out of the city.
“You’re going to lose more and more African American people mainly because they can’t afford the cost of living,” Jackson said. “If we want to do anything to guarantee the African-Americans the right to stay here, we have to have increases like this. We have to increase the minimum wage, but also increase job opportunities and trainings. It’s been a long time, but I’ve been unemployed, and these changes all should help.”
Hagner said the cost of the new benefits would not be detrimental to the local economy, stressing that employers will not experience any increase in taxation from the current levels, which were approved by the Department of Labor to finance the expansion.
“When we did the math, D.C. has been too conservative and its unemployed workers have been suffering as a result,” Hagner said. “D.C. can afford to pay more, so this should not harm employers with the exception of certain employers who pay out-of-pocket.”
Jackson said that since its last expansion in 2005, the Unemployment Insurance program has not kept pace with the mounting costs of living in D.C.
“The cost of living is already unduly high, and it’s just getting higher because of so many people that are moving into the city and forcing the prices of houses to go up,” Jackson said. “The Metro has gone up, the price of food has gone up — everything except benefits of people, which should be parallel to cost-of-living triggers. Change is necessary.”

The historic canal in Georgetown will begin to undergo a major 18-month restoration project in order to address long-running maintenance concerns next month.
Estimated to cost about $10 million, the restoration is funded by the U.S. National Park Service.
The C&O Canal attracts about 5 million visitors a year and stretches from Georgetown to Cumberland, Maryland. The repairs to the canal, which has been in operation for nearly 100 years, will focus on locks 3 and 4 located between 30th Street NW and Thomas Jefferson Street NW. The goal of this project is to revamp and remodel the mile-long segment of the C&O Canal in Georgetown.
Brendan Wilson, supervisory park ranger for the Georgetown District of the Canal, said the canal and the locks under renovation are of historical importance. He discussed their history as a cornerstone of the country’s industrial development when they transported cargo from the Allegheny Mountains ever since the canal’s construction began in 1831.
“These locks are important parts of understanding the historic fabric,” Wilson said. “Part of this is to bring in students and bring in this educational part of the canal.”
The canal path will be closed between Thomas Jefferson and 30th Streets NW for the duration of the project but the National Park Service will keep 30th Street NW, which runs above the canal, open during the restoration project. In addition, the canal will be drained of water from Georgetown to lock 5.
Maggie Downing, Destination Manager of the Georgetown Business Improvement District, said a combination of budget cuts and overdue maintenance has caused the locks to deteriorate and crumble.
“The National Park Service has had their budget cut year after year and they had a huge backlog of deferred maintenance costs and so parts of the park have been falling into disrepair with the locks 3 and 4 starting to experience some issues,” Downing said.
Funding for the restoration project will come from a combination of grants and fundraising, including $7 million from the NPS budget. Georgetown Heritage further received a $3 million grant from the D.C. Council allocated from the District’s 2017 budget, the majority of which Downing said will go toward purchasing the new canal boat.
“All the money that we raise as a partner can go into the additional enhancements and programming,” Downing said.
The famous mule-drawn canal boat The Georgetown, which has not been in use since 2011, is also slated to be replaced as a part of the greater canal restoration project. The boat was officially retired last week due to the accumulation of damage.
Downing also works with Georgetown Heritage, a group of government, community and business leaders working toward improving aspects of historic Georgetown. These leaders created Georgetown Heritage to ensure the restoration of the Georgetown canal.
After the completion of the first phase of restoration with the lock repairs, Georgetown Heritage plans to move its focus to various smaller-scale changes. Downing said a variety of infrastructure improvements are also in place, such as improved lighting, repaving the towpath, better signage, new benches and improved accessibility.
“The other piece that we are kicking off is the beginning of what we are calling a Comprehensive Master Plan for the one-mile section of the canal in Georgetown,” Downing said. “We realized that beyond those just infrastructure needs there’s a lot of areas in the park that could be improved.”
Downing said the restoration project will attempt to preserve the history of the canal and further educate visitors.
“Everything that we’re going to be doing will be informed by the history of the place and aimed at finding new ways to share that,” Downing said.
Georgetown Outdoor Education Guide Connor O’Brien (SFS ’18) said he believes the restoration will encourage students to spend even more time outdoors.
“The canal is one of the most accessible outdoor areas for Georgetown students, and I think it acts as an important connection to the natural beauty of the D.C. area,” O’Brien said. “Hopefully restoration of the canal will ensure that it continues to play an important role for future Georgetown students.”

When the university makes major decisions regarding student life — from the closing of Kehoe Field to capital projects affecting students — the proposals are discussed by Director of Virgin Hotels Alberto Beeck (SFS ’91), Chair of the Board of Regents Laurie Hodges Lapeyre (MSB ’83) and two student delegates appointed by the Georgetown University Student Association.
The two representatives, Sara Castigilia (COL ’18) and Connor Maytnier (COL ’17), serve two-year terms on the working group on student affairs of the 40-person board of directors. In addition, GUSA appoints four students to sit on the Georgetown University Alumni Association board of governors for one-year terms beginning in the spring after a new GUSA executive is elected.
These students are selected through an application and interview process overseen by the GUSA president, vice president and chief of staff. Hunter Estes (SFS ’19), Anthony Fadil (MSB ’17), Ben Germano (SFS ’16) and Nicole Lam (COL ’18) currently serve on the board of governors.
According to Castigilia, the two representatives serve as a liaison between GUSA and the board of directors.
“We use our time to bring up student concerns and let them know which issues are most pressing to the student body,” Castigilia wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We work very closely with [GUSA President] Enushe [Khan (MSB ’17)] and [GUSA Vice President] Chris [Fisk (COL ’17)] to make sure that the issues GUSA sees as important are brought to the table. It has been a wonderful opportunity thus far, and the board is a very receptive group of individuals who work hard to make our community better.”
The board of directors oversees major decisions for the university, including the approval of the university’s budget and the initiatives charged by university President John J. DeGioia.
The board of governors — the elected leadership of the GUAA — directs alumni engagement. Student representatives of this group focus on voicing student priorities, including goals for fundraising and connecting with alumni.
Despite the amount of influence held by student representatives on the board of directors and the GUAA board of governors, their presence and function remain relatively unknown by the general student body and even members of GUSA.
“I really don’t know what the boards are,” Catriona Kendall (SFS ’20), a member of GUSA’s Free Speech Policy Team, said.
“All I really know is that GUSA has a board of some sort. I don’t know if that’s related to the Executive though,” Cynthia Sun (SFS ’20), a member of GUSA’s Mental Health Policy Team, said.
Khan said the student board representative positions also provide another route to university leadership on campus, allowing more voices to be heard during their meetings.
“We have a lot of different leaders on our campus, and it’s also about creating different leadership opportunities to do that. So, you don’t have to be GUSA president to be at a board of directors meeting. There are other opportunities to be very much engaged in senior decision-making processes,” Khan said.
At the last meeting, students focused on finding a short-term solution to the closure of Kehoe Field, which affected over 700 club athletes due to lack of adequate field space. Representatives also discussed the option of Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle weekend transportation and the concerns students have about a lack of transparency regarding tuition.
Khan said the meeting allowed students and administrators an opportunity to discuss solutions.
“The tuition conversation went very well, and along with what we’ve been doing in our conversations with the provost we have good news on that front,” Khan said. “The Kehoe field will now be discussed again at the winter meeting and the conversation on GUTS is something that we are continuing to talk to the university on.”
Khan said the reason for an application-based process is due to the seriousness and depth of these roles.
“It’s more so for continuity,” Khan said. “The directors are really listening to what the students are saying because they believe, and sort of trust that these are students that truly are representing student interests, and are students who know enough about the university and are making recommendations based on actual institutional knowledge and background information.”
The GUSA president sits on the board of directors during its plenary session, when various university community members are invited to attend.
Khan said having influence with the board of directors is important to making progress on initiatives.
“There is no more important body on this campus than the university’s board of directors. They are the ultimate decision-makers,” Khan said.
The student representatives to the GUAA board of governors meet with the rest of GUSA regularly to discuss projects to connect student and alumni. As much of the philanthropy directed toward Georgetown comes from alumni, student priorities regarding funding are discussed thoroughly before being communicated to the board of governors.
Estes said the board is made up of alumni dedicated to improving life at Georgetown.
“The alumni network is one of the greatest aspects of Georgetown. These alumni have blazed trails in career-fields that much of the students hope to follow,” Estes wrote in an email to The Hoya. It is my goal as a representative to find new and unique ways to bring alumni and students together through mentorship opportunities and new communication techniques of the like that hasn’t been seen before at Georgetown.”
Khan said although students are represented at high levels of administration, she said it is important to ensure students’ concerns are understood by the board.
“While it’s great that we have students in the room presenting, I still have concerns about gaps in student representation on the board overall and I think we’ve seen with conversations on tuition that that’s something a lot of students have expressed concerns about,” Khan said.

Georgetown University should make it easier to report bias-related incidents, according to a panel of administrators, professors and students during a discussion in the Makóm Jewish Gathering Place on Thursday.
The current bias reporting system, which was introduced in 2004, enables students to report bias online and find resources to support them through bias incidents.
Both students and faculty on the panel said that there are problems with the current system’s accessibility and transparency, particularly around follow-up policies.
Georgetown’s definition of bias entails both verbal and physical personal attacks and attacks against minority groups on the basis of religion, gender presentation or orientation, race or national origin, according to Associate Dean for Student Affairs Dennis Williams, who also leads the bias reporting team.
Williams said that it is important to continue to develop the system’s follow-up procedures and ensure that there is as much transparency as possible throughout the process.
“It’s difficult for people to know what happens and that’s a flaw in the system. What we do need to get better at is identifying the most useful ways to use that information once we have it,” Williams said.
Luke Brown (COL ’17), who was a student panelist, said he was not aware of how the information gathered in the reports was acted on, used and disseminated.
“Today it seems to be a bit of a black box, where I certainly don’t know where that information is going and I wouldn’t feel informed enough to encourage or inform other students to seek out this resource,” Brown said.
Williams said while there are some incidents that may not be clearly motivated by bias, they should still be reported.
“There’s a lot of stuff that sort of flies under the radar that certainly doesn’t rise to the level of a hate crime, or that may not even be under violation of the student code of conduct,” Williams said. “It’s still just as important to let somebody know that it happened.”
Georgetown University Student Association President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said that there needs to be a larger campus dialogue about bias-related incidents.
“This is something that sits very close to my heart as a student who has faced bias on this campus and I just think that when we talk about issues pertaining to identity and bias there are barriers to reporting,” Khan said. “I think it warrants larger student body conversations that don’t take place in echo chambers.”
Most harmful instances of bias originate from ignorance toward certain issues, rather than an intent to harm others, according to Kate Wysong (SFS ’19), a student panelist.
Wysong said the burden is on students to educate each other on how to live in a diverse environment.
“People may have grown up in places where certain identities are just not as prevalent and a lot of comments just come from ignorance. Maybe in certain contexts that comment wouldn’t be that offensive,” Wysong said. “Yet it’s then us students that end up being the ones ‘teachering.’”
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, who attended the panel, said that “teachering” – the act of students teaching their peers on matters of diversity and awareness – has become a common trend across campus. Some students are growing tired of playing this role, according to Olson.
“I’ve heard from students that they feel like they’re in that teacher role a lot and that can be exhausting,” Olson said.

Washington, D.C. Auditor Kathy Patterson’s office condemned the privatization of D.C. Public Schools’ food services for failing to deliver on promises to cut costs and improve quality in a 70-page report released Oct. 7.
The report recommended severing ties with contractors and reinstating in-house meal operations.
The District, enticed by the promise of saving $4 million each year in local expenditures, opted to switch to contractors from in-house services for food supply in 2008. DCPS paid its food vendors between $4.16 and $4.24 for each school lunch while it was only reimbursed $3.15 per meal by the federal government. This forced D.C. to cover the $9 million difference with taxpayer money.
Food vendors further failed to increase lunch participation from 51 percent to the expected 71.6 percent within the first year of the contract, which would have increased revenues from reimbursements per meal served.
Patterson said the transition to private contractors resulted in gross inefficiencies in the food distribution system, trapping DCPS in a perpetual cycle of losses.
“The school system moved to the unit price contract, whereby no matter what it cost the vendor to produce that meal, the District will pay the vendor the fixed price of four dollars and change,” Patterson said. “There’s no incentive there for keeping costs modest.”
DCPS Interim Chief Operating Officer Carla Watson, who received a draft of the report prior to its official release, defended the privatization system in a Sept. 26 letter responding to the D.C. Auditor’s report. Watson affirmed DCPS officials’ intention to remain committed to private preparation of food.
“DCPS’ new food service contracts are in their infancy and operations have been under way for only a matter of weeks,” Watson wrote. “We have confidence in our existing contracts, which require the highest levels of nutrition, food quality, customer service, innovation and community partnership.”
Until the current school year, DCPS employed Chartwells-Thompson Hospitality to provide food for DCPS students. However, the company was forced to pay a $19.4 million settlement to the city last year after an investigation spurred by a whistleblower lawsuit found Chartwells had mismanaged its food service programs in D.C. by serving rotten food to students and participating in a multi-million dollar fraud. Chartwells asked for and was granted a release from its contract with DCPS in July 2015.
In May, D.C. Central Kitchen and SodexoMagic — along with subcontractor Revolution Foods — assumed the mantle of providing meals to over 100 schools for breakfast, lunch, after-school dinner and summer food service. However, Sodexo was dogged by allegations of serving expired food and violating employee safety regulations, which lead to the settlement of a $20 million New York lawsuit in 2010.
Disturbed by the Chartwells lawsuit, D.C. Councilmember Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3) asked the D.C. Auditor’s office to examine the privatization of school food services in 2015. Cheh said to local radio station WTOP she was dismayed over the report’s results and advocated for reinstating in-house meal operations.
“I’ve been asking them for years to bring it back,” Cheh said. “It’s a failure of their responsibility, it’s a failure of their management effectiveness, it’s a failure of their commitment to our kids.”
The report recommends that DCPS prepare to serve food again by making short deals with smaller vendors until the city takeover process is complete. Patterson said the original decision to privatize the food services may have been advisable in 2008 if school administrators wanted to put a greater focus on academics rather than nutrition programs.
“I think one of the big factors has been the decision by the school system that the nutrition programs were not a core mission of the school system,” Patterson said. “Therefore, hiring an outside vendor to come in and provide the meal made sense from the school system’s perspective.”
Patterson estimates in-house food preparation will eventually be reinstated following pressure from the D.C. Council to cut costs.
“I think eventually it will be brought back in house, but that’s really just a guess,” Patterson said. “I think there’s councilmembers who are pushing in that direction. My suspicion is that the current administration will probably follow the lead of their school leaders.”

A group of students will launch The Georgetown Review tomorrow as Georgetown’s first-ever daily conservative publication.
In an effort to broaden its readership base, Editor-in-Chief of The Georgetown Review Kevin Toohers (COL ’17)said The Georgetown Review will not be directly associated with the Georgetown University College Republicans, unlike The Right Way.
The publication, which will publish online daily, builds off the GUCR’s former official online publication, The Right Way, which was founded in 2013 and discontinued this summer.
The Review will launch with 10 to 12 writers, two editors and an editor-in-chief — a larger staff than The Right Way’s ten-person staff during its peak. The Georgetown Review plans to hire more writers as the publication grows.
Toohers said he hopes to establish The Georgetown Review as a serious medium for conservative dialogue on pressing political issues.
“The inspiration for The Georgetown Review occurred with an awareness that we needed a more robust platform to get our message across and to have a more influential voice on campus,” Toohers said. “The changes we’ve made to this conservative publication will allow us to build a prominent voice through an expanded staff and updated and sleeker website, and greater depth of coverage.”
Danny Travers (COL ’18), who will serve as an editor for the publication, said The Georgetown Review will aim to focus on topics that do not appear on headlines in national newspapers.
“My goal, anyway, is to provide a broader perspective of plurality of ideas on Georgetown’s campus,” Travers said.
The Georgetown University College Democrats currently publish the GU Progressive as their official publication, which was launched in 2009.
“Anything being written or published isn’t going to the broader campus, it’s being pushed inside of these organizations. With The Georgetown Review, we want to bring it outside of the College Republicans and bring it into a central role as a publication on campus,” Toohers said.
According to Toohers, The Georgetown Review will help fill a void by serving as a publication devoted solely to politics.
“While Georgetown prides itself on being a politically engaged campus, its political publications have often fallen short,” Toohers said. “If we look at the current landscape of political publications, The Right Way and The GU Progressive haven’t played large roles in influencing political conversations. The Georgetown Review will be critical in enhancing political discussion.”
Former Editor-in-Chief of The Right Way Alex Robledo (COL ’17) said the community would significantly benefit with a political publication. Robledo said he expected a stronger presence of outlets for political expression on campus given the amount of political activity at Georgetown.
“Coming to Georgetown, I expected that the Democrats and Republicans would have publications like the Progressive and The Right Way set up,” Robledo said. “The publications play a minor role in terms of campus dialogue.”
Correction: This article previously stated Alex Robledo (COL ’17) was female, Robledo is male. This article also previously stated The Right Way was founded in 2015; it was founded in 2013.

Washington, D.C. local prosecutors will be allowed to try misdemeanors in federal courts effective this month, a move that will allow federal officials from the District’s U.S. Attorney’s office to focus their efforts on prosecuting violent felony offenders in Washington, D.C.
Under the new plan, the office of Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) will supply nearly $1.2 million to the D.C. Attorney’s office, which consists of local prosecutors. This money will allow for the D.C. Attorney’s office to loan eight prosecutors to the federal U.S. Attorney’s office in Washington, D.C. to assist in prosecuting the District’s non-violent crime.
The justice system in D.C. has been almost entirely run by federal officials since the 1990s, when D.C. Mayor Marion Barry , Jr. (D) ceded local control over its prosecutions and incarcerations to federal prosecutors as a condition of being bailed out by the federal government.
Bowser, United States Attorney for the District of Columbia Channing Phillips and D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine announced these changes in a memorandum of understanding dated Sept. 29.
At the live-streamed announcement releasing the memorandum, Racine lauded the cooperation of their offices in order to achieve this deal.
“These efforts where we combine our best brains together and figure out what we can do to try to keep people safer is really government at its best,” Racine said.
A rising homicide rate for the second year in a row as well as other increases in crime have spurred Bowser’s efforts to increase the efficiency of criminal prosecutions and thereby reform the city’s criminal justice system. According to the Metropolitan Police Department, the D.C. homicide rate in 2015 increased by nearly 55 percent from the previous year with 162 murders occurring in last year.
According to the Washington Post, currently federal prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s office investigating non-violent crime in D.C. can expect to simultaneously handle 150 misdemeanor cases, which drastically decreases their efficacy.
The eight new attorneys who will be loaned to the U.S. Attorney’s office under the deal should allow federal prosecutors to dedicate more time and resources to their higher-level cases. The federal prosecutors can then place greater focus on cases involving more violent and dangerous criminals than those in misdemeanors.
Bowser said she hopes increasing the number of crimes local prosecutors can deal with will result in a larger ratio of convictions of violent criminal offenders. Last month, Bowser characterized the previous system of federal persecution of local crime as inefficient.
“We are unique in that the prosecutors don’t report to the people,” Bowser said at a press conference Sept. 7. “They don’t report to me, either.”
The D.C. Council rejected Bowser’s tough-on-crime proposals expanding police powers. In May, Bowser vetoed the council’s ideas of paying criminals not to commit crimes. As a result, not many measures to reduce crime have been implemented, despite the rising crime rate.Bowser said the agreement is a major step for the city as it attempts to tackle its crime problems. Bowser also approved of how the agreement would allow D.C. to regain more power to try its own criminal cases.
“This is one example of the District stepping up to the plate in making sure that we’re making the investments needed, but also demonstrating that we can be an active partner and a fiscal partner in our criminal justice system,” Bowser said.
Georgetown Law Professor Abbe Smith, who serves as the director of the Criminal Defense and Prisoner Advocacy Clinic, said she remains skeptical of the new plan’s ability to achieve greater fairness in criminal trials, but she said the importance lies in the fact that the change provides greater autonomy for the District.
“I think the significance is that it respects the District’s democratic processes in electing an attorney general, a local prosecutor. You could say that the attorney general prosecuting crime is another step towards home rule in the District of Columbia,” Smith said. “I think it’s probably more important theoretically than it is practically because it doesn’t really matter which agency prosecutes crime unless there’s fundamentally different ideology.”
Georgetown University Police Department Chief Jay Gruber said he supports the strategy, as local city prosecutors will be better primed to work on non-violent cases. Gruber noted that Washington, D.C. still needs greater efforts to combat crime, but the agreement marked a step in the right direction.
“I think local prosecutors are better equipped to handle local cases like this, so I think it’s a very good move,” Gruber said. “I think time will tell if it’s an effective move, and if it’s the right move, but I do think it’s a good start.”
