Members of Georgetown University’s graduate student union reflect on their journey to recognition one year after the union signed its first contract with the university.
The Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees’ first union contract with the university, signed May 8, secured pay raises, expanded health benefits and improved mental health resources for graduate student workers. The agreement came months after graduate workers entered negotiations over COVID-19 safety protocols.
The finalization of the union contract amid the COVID-19 pandemic was a testament to the strong commitment GAGE members have to one another, according to GAGE President Daniel Solomon (GRD ’23). 
“A year ago I think was a moment that reflected the strength of the organizing that we had done and the extent to which members really demonstrated that they were committed to showing up for each other, despite the current displacement that the pandemic caused for all of our health and safety and livelihoods,” Solomon said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
The May 2020 contract was also a step toward making graduate work more equitable across socioeconomic statuses and racial and ethnic backgrounds, according to Jewel Tomasula (GRD ’22), a biology student and former president of GAGE. 
“It’s a really challenging career to go into, in general, and then especially if you are from a minority background or a disadvantaged group, and so our contract was a really big step forward in changing that at Georgetown,” Tomasula said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. 
The fight for recognition began in 2018 when Georgetown graduate students voted to unionize following a yearlong campaign for increased worker protections from the university. After over a year of in-person advocacy, GAGE began to lobby virtually when the university shifted to fully remote operations because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
GAGE also fought for COVID-19 related protections, submitting demands for increased health protections and job security in July 2020. Two months later, GAGE filed a grievance against the university alleging breach of contract after the university refused to negotiate over COVID-19 protections. 
In January 2021, an independent arbitrator ruled that the university did not bargain in good faith with GAGE regarding grievances over COVID-19 related policies. As a result, the university met graduate students’ demands for personal protective equipment, COVID-19 testing and subscriptions to mental health services.
Increased COVID-19 protections for workers were made possible by GAGE’s commitment to building relationships based on collective action to improve the lives of workers, according to Solomon. 
“We’ve had these important victories that couldn’t have happened without that committed organizing and the commitment to building personal relationships that all align with a collective vision of improving the lives of graduate workers at Georgetown,” Solomon said. 
As of the May 2020 contract, all PhD candidates have access to full dental insurance through the union. The contract also granted graduate workers on nine-month contracts with a 12% pay boost to $32,500 and workers on 12-month contracts a 15% boost to $35,500. Previously, the Executive Committee of Graduate Studies, a body of faculty members and deans responsible for crafting graduate student policies, decided graduate student workers’ stipends and benefits. 
The contract was especially important for graduate students who do not have access to health insurance, according to Ellen Jacobs (GRD ’24), a biology student and chair of GAGE. The contract allowed Jacobs to visit an eye doctor, dentist and primary care physician. 
Jacobs, who lives in California, said the pay raises and insurance included in the contract have increased the living options graduate students will have when they move back to Washington, D.C.
“The pay raise is also very nice. It means that when I do move to D.C., I can live somewhere a little bit nicer than I did maybe last year when I was really concerned about trying to afford something in the D.C. area on the pretty small stipend we were getting,” Jacobs said. 
The return to in-person classes in the fall will allow graduate workers to see the full extent of the agreement, including the Emergency Assistance Fund, an emergency fund for graduate student workers which will be replenished annually, according to Tomasula. 
“As we come back to campus and we have a graduate experience that is on campus, is in our workspaces and people have to be in D.C., I think people are going to experience the benefits of the contract in new ways, and I’m excited for that.” Tomasula said. 
Tomasula said she is looking forward to seeing how the contact benefits workers in the long run. 
“It’s kind of exciting to think about how the contract is going to keep helping people as time goes on,” Tomasula said.

The Georgetown University Student Association Senate demanded the university implement free summer stability housing and cheaper rates for non-stability summer housing in a statement released Sunday.
The statement comes after a university announcement in mid-April disclosed increased housing costs for the summer term, which lasts from June 6 to Aug. 14. Students will have to pay $4,485 for on-campus housing this summer, a multi-thousand dollar increase from the discounted summer 2020 rate of $1,500.
The statement calls on the university to reduce non-stability summer housing costs to $3,850, equivalent to $50 per day, which matches the costs of living in university housing during the spring and fall semesters. The statement calls on the university to offer free stability housing for students who face housing instability and depend on campus living. 
According to the statement, students have reported the university has provided limited aid for the summer term, leaving many struggling to pay for summer housing.
The university must better support its students who require on-campus housing amid the COVID-19 pandemic, according to GUSA Senator Rowlie Flores (COL ’22), who helped draft the statement.
“To some students not experiencing housing instability, our demands may seem ambitious, but after a year of mental exhaustion and financial manipulation, low-income students need all the resources and help that they deserve,” Flores wrote in an email to The Hoya.
For many low-income students, off-campus housing is not an option because of the high cost of rent in Washington, D.C., according to GUSA Senator Dominic Gordon (SFS ’24), who co-sponsored the statement.
“Housing is extraordinarily expensive in the D.C. area,” Gordon wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It’s impossible to assume that low income marginalized groups that cannot be at their homes can possibly afford to pay for D.C. housing.”
Students currently living on campus who were approved for spring stability housing can continue to live on campus during the summer, according to a university email. Students who received stability housing were approved through the Housing Stability Application process, which determines students’ eligibility for university housing based on students’ experience with housing or food insecurity, high financial need or extraordinary living circumstances.
Although the university offered a discounted rate for summer housing last year, rates in past years have been similar to the costs implemented this summer.
The university is in the process of addressing the financial need of students who rely on summer stability housing but are not enrolled in classes, according to a university spokesperson.
“We appreciate GUSA’s advocacy on behalf of students adversely affected by the pandemic, and the continued health and safety of our students is a top priority,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Administrators in the offices of Residential Living, Student Affairs, and Student Financial Services are working to determine how to assist those students who won’t be enrolled in classes this summer, but who need help meeting the costs of housing, food and other expenses during the period after their Spring term ends and before their Fall term begins.” 
GUSA Senate Speaker Melanie Cruz-Morales (COL ’22), who also helped write the statement, said her housing situation was impacted by the raised housing costs and many other students who have had their voices ignored by the university have also been affected by the change.
“There’s currently a lot of students who have literally nowhere to go and you need to grasp the reality of that deafness,” Cruz-Morales said to senators at a GUSA meeting Sunday. “My housing situation itself is extremely complex right now and so honestly this is a very ignored community, often in this space, in this environment at Georgetown.”
The statement also calls on the university to provide free transition housing for the period May 20 to June 2. The university will charge $65 per night, despite offering free transition housing in summer 2020. 
“Right now the University is, albeit unintentionally, engineering a homelessness crisis among their most marginalized students. Many are being asked to go back to abusive families and other toxic living situations, and that reality should be unacceptable to administrators,” the statement reads. “The only way forward is for the University to grant free summer and transition housing to any students who have been approved for stability housing and need it.”
Until the university addresses the costs of summer stability housing, students will continue to face uncertainty about their housing and financial situations, according to GUSA Senator Eric Perez (COL ’23).
“It’s up to the University to step in and provide free, safe housing for these students this summer, this is a full fledged homelessness crisis being instigated by the University, and they should take their responsibility to us more seriously,” Perez wrote in an email to The Hoya.

Georgetown University graduate student government leadership voted to form an advocacy committee focused on collaborative diversity and inclusion efforts for students, as part of a broader racial justice campaign launched by the organization.
Under the Executive Committee for Diversity and Inclusion, executive board members and senators of the Georgetown University Graduate Student Government will coordinate diversity and inclusion initiatives among graduate programs, as well as work with university officials on related proposals.
The move comes as a part of GradGov’s racial justice and inclusivity campaign, which was spurred by the recent verdict announcement in the Derek Chauvin trial, a former Minneapolis police officer who was convicted for the killing of an unarmed Black man, George Floyd.
The committee will allow members of GradGov to more deeply examine issues of inclusivity that affect students, according to Jonah Klempner (LAW ’22), president of GradGov.
“The truth is that one of the major problems at Georgetown in terms of diversity and inclusion is that they look at diversity and inclusion numbers from the top and their efforts from the top,” Klempner said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Diversity and inclusion is really all about the room that you’re in. There need to be changes in each room, and some people are doing that better than others.”
The new committee will consist of 15 members selected from either the GradGov executive board or the GradGov senate. The structuring of the committee will make it easier to coordinate diversity and inclusion efforts across the 115 graduate programs under the domain of GradGov, according to Klempner.
“I think coordinating those efforts and trying to centralize them by saying, ‘Here’s what other programs have already instituted, and here’s a roadmap’ is going to be really helpful to bringing that change to each program, especially with programs that are further behind,” Klempner said.
In addition to the creation of the Executive Committee for Diversity and Inclusion, GradGov also proposed a list of action items for the university, including increasing diversity in faculty hiring and establishing a graduate-specific Office of Diversity and Inclusion.
The push for diversity and inclusion initiatives comes after recent incidents in Georgetown graduate programs, including a Georgetown Law Center professor who was fired after a video of the professor voicing racist views toward Black students went viral.
Increasing diversity in faculty and staff is an urgent priority for universities, considering many institutions of higher education have only been desegregated for 60 or 70 years, according to Tamara Springer (GRD ’21), the outgoing director of advocacy at GradGov. 
“Our professors mostly stem from very similar backgrounds and walks of life,” Springer said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Obviously the school has voiced that they want to improve diversity. One of the first ways to do that is hiring more diverse faculty and staff.” 
Georgetown has already begun identifying ways to address the concerns of graduate students regarding diversity and inclusion, according to a university spokesperson. 
“Our schools, departments and units across our campus have launched new work in the past year related to curriculum, pedagogy and course design, recruitment of faculty of color, mentorship, and fellowships for students from disadvantaged backgrounds,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In addition to facilitating diverse hiring practices, the university agreed to hire an Assistant Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion for graduate programs, according to a university spokesperson. Currently, Georgetown does not have a specific position dedicated to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives for either undergraduate or graduate students.
The position will serve within a graduate-specific Office of Diversity and Inclusion, which will be implemented over the summer, according to Klempner.
The move to broaden inclusivity and diversity initiatives comes after Georgetown released the results of its first graduate cultural climate survey April 16, which highlighted that students felt racial justice should be a part of the curriculum across the university’s programs, according to Klempner.
Georgetown is currently reviewing and responding to the results of the diversity survey and will collaborate with GradGov in the future on diversity initiatives to strengthen inclusion and belonging on Georgetown’s campus, according to a university spokesperson. 
It is important the university fosters a community where students of all identities and backgrounds can feel at home, according to Taelor Logan (GRD ’22), current director of advocacy at GradGov. 
“I come from a community where a lot of people in the Black community don’t go to schools like this because we feel like it’s not for us,” Logan said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “And we want to change that. I want people to see that you have just as much capability and right to be in these schools as anybody else, and that starts with the schools providing an atmosphere where people can see that.” 
Though it seems near impossible for these changes to happen overnight, GradGov’s persistent advocacy efforts in favor of diversity and inclusion at the university represent the path to achieving the goal of increased equity, according to Klempner.
“It’s not something where you’re going to wake up and see a change; it’s something that is slowly happening,” Klempner said. “I do believe that the process is underway. It’s just about keeping the pressure on and reminding them every once and a while because GradGov does not have the power to hire faculty, but they do take our advice.”

Georgetown University graduate students have launched an email campaign calling for the inclusion of graduate students in multicultural graduation ceremonies.
The campaign asks students to send a template email to Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson calling on the university to invite graduate students to multicultural graduation ceremonies, which are currently exclusive to undergraduate students. These ceremonies include events for Asian American and Pacific Islander students, Black students, and Latinx and Chicanas/Chicanos.
Jhoselin Beltran Contreras (GRD ’21) and Jennifer Argueta-Contreras (GRD ’21) launched the campaign after learning graduate students would not be included in the multicultural graduation ceremonies scheduled to be held virtually May 20. These events are a space for students of color to celebrate their achievements prior to graduation. Upon attendance, each graduate is honored with a stole. 
The email criticizes Georgetown for failing graduate students by denying them access to multicultural ceremonies for years and for the lack of institutionally acknowledged cultural spaces for graduate students.
“There is no established and institutionally-acknowledged cultural space at Georgetown University for graduate students of color. Georgetown is working toward combating racial injustice, yet falls short for graduate students,” the email campaign reads. 
Beltran Contreras said multicultural graduations are important moments for families. At Beltran Contreras’ own undergraduate Latinx ceremony at the University of Maryland, her grandmother who does not speak English was able to attend and celebrate her graduation as a family. 
“I was able to share that with her and it made me feel comfortable. It made my family so comfortable, and that was important to me,” Beltran Contreras said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
For first-generation students like Argueta-Contreras, a multicultural graduation ceremony is an important way to celebrate achievement in the context of a wider community, Argueta-Contreras wrote. 
“I am a first-generation Latina student, so having made it where I am today means that my accomplishments are not just for myself. They are for my parents, my community, and my ancestors who did not have the opportunities that I have today,” Argueta-Contreras wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Over the last year, equity and inclusion have been a focus of graduate student advocacy at Georgetown. Just two months ago, the Georgetown Graduate Student Government met with the university to discuss racial justice initiatives beyond the undergraduate level. Now, Beltran Contreras and Argueta-Contreras have added their voices to the fight for increased inclusivity at the graduate level.
Multicultural ceremonies are important for students of color, and the university’s failure to include graduate students undermines their accomplishments, according to Beltran Contreras. 
“I think that a lot of students of color feel that way, and just because we’re in the graduate program that doesn’t make the accomplishment less significant,” Beltran Contreras said.
Multicultural graduation ceremonies are likely to be offered for future graduating classes, according to a university spokesperson. 
“While it is unlikely the University can offer a graduate multicultural ceremony this year, the Graduate School is committed to working with GradGov, CMEA, and BIPOC students to offer a ceremony in 2022,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
University officials plan to meet with Beltran Contreras and Argueta-Contreras on May 12 to discuss future plans for graduate student inclusion in multicultural ceremonies, according to a university spokesperson.
Last month, the university announced plans to host an in-person graduation ceremony at Nationals Park, which will also be virtually broadcast for friends and family who cannot attend.
Graduate students deserve an invitation to attend the multicultural ceremonies, especially in light of the university’s recent announcement that the Class of 2021 will have an in-person graduation, according to Grace Rector (SFS ’21), who shared the email campaign in a GroupMe for on-campus students. 
“Graduation is really significant and we’re just grateful that it’s happening in person,” Rector said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “But I think that graduate students deserve just as much to have their multicultural ceremony.”
For Argueta-Contreras, the movement to include graduate students in multicultural graduation ceremonies is also meaningful for future students.
“Future multicultural graduate students deserve recognition and should not have to face this challenge. Our goal is to advocate for students in the present and for future generations,” Argueta-Contreras wrote.

The Hoya loses credibility again because it couldn’t find one person for the article who believes that multicultural ceremonies are disunifying?

HoyaStudent says 
May 16, 2021 at 11:02 am
Whoever finds the multicultural ceremonies disunifying needs to dive into their positionality? 
Do you even have the right to say students of color don’t deserve their own space?
Please look up the benefits of affinity spaces.
Thank you!

Scary you are suggesting that the First Amendment might not cover such speech.

HoyaStudent says 
June 3, 2021 at 7:34 pm
Scary you’re avoiding that the First Amendment covers freedom of *expression*. 
Your comments scream: “I don’t want to unpack my positionality because I know it won’t help my argument.”
Ask yourself: Am I a part of these groups getting a multicultural ceremony?
Again, look up the benefits. 
And I advise you to not make such an accusation/assumption that the Hoya “loses credibility” for listening to voices that would’ve before been silenced. 
You know what they say about people who ASSume.

Hoyaum says 
June 14, 2021 at 12:17 pm
You may not realize First Amendment is not in play here.   
Not denying the benefits — you have ASSumed that.   I’m sure the attendees feel really good about attending.    
I have assumed nothing — I have stated my opinion, which you are free to disagree with. 
Do “multicultural” students also attend the main graduation ceremony at GU in the same numbers?

In the pigment print titled “Okuniewicz,” a suit-clad Clark Kent, Superman’s alter ego, sits above a background of speckled matzo bread. Above Kent’s raised eyebrow and blue-toned hair is typography telling the story of a Jewish immigrant changing his last name to Kent. For artist Gail Rebhan, the piece calls attention to how American culture has obscured Jewish identity.
The print, along with nearly 70 other pieces of artwork from over 40 different artists, is part of an exhibition titled “Jewish Authenticity and Identity.” The exhibition, curated by Georgetown University professor Ori Soltes, is being presented both virtually and in person at the Adas Israel Congregation, the largest conservative synagogue in Washington, D.C., and explores the concept of identity within Jewish culture.
For Soltes, pieces such as “Okuniewicz” highlight the exhibition’s broader goal to examine Jewish culture and identity in the world.
“The backdrop is Passover matzo, that quintessential gastronomic element that is associated with remembering who you are, where you came from,” Soltes said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “It’s all a play on that idea of identity, and to what extent do I give up or retain my Jewish identity.”
Soltes, who teaches at the Center for Jewish Civilization, an academic program within the School of Foreign Service that aims to promote the study of Judaism as it pertains to foreign policy, religion and culture, began selecting pieces for the exhibition between January and April 2020, with hundreds of artists, nearly half of whom live near the District, submitting their work for consideration.
In addition to creating an environment to hold dialogue on Jewish identity and culture, the exhibition also examines the role of Jewish artists in the world, according to Soltes.
“The given was if you’re submitting work to be considered for this exhibit, you consider yourself Jewish, by whatever way you know. Completely secular, completely orthodox, whatever in between,” Soltes said. “So it doesn’t require for me to define how it’s Jewish, but what it requires of me is that I explore how it’s Jewish.”
The exhibition helped featured artists reflect on their own identity, according to exhibition director Robert Bettman, who originally conceived the exhibit’s concept and later asked Soltes to join as lead curator. 
“One of the things that we have all experienced is real difficulty in navigating our identities,” Bettman said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It feels like there’s not a lot of opportunity for overtly Jewish artists. You can be a successful artist, but if you speak about your identity in any way, it feels like there’s not a lot of room there.”
Soltes said he was surprised by the range and variety of submissions to the exhibition, especially regarding the subject matter of submissions, which addressed topics of gender, civil rights and immigration policies. While some pieces included in “Authenticity and Identity” date back to the early 1970s, others are more contemporary, including photographs and collages from 2020. 
The exhibit additionally allows viewers to examine the evolution of Jewish art, including both form and style, as well as historical influences, according to the exhibit’s introductory essay, “The Issue of Jewish Art and Identity,” written by Soltes. 
With “Authenticity and Identity,” Soltes specifically sought to organize the artwork in terms of both the chronological journey of the Jewish diaspora as well as artists’ interpretation of the diffusion of Jewish identity throughout the world. 
“I kind of moved chronologically into the post-biblical diasporic world of Jews, so the history, but then also embedded in that history there were kind of two ideas,” Soltes said. “One, what are the essential sort of values and concepts that have been addressed within the Jewish tradition and, therefore, being addressed by a number of these artists. And secondly, what has been the Jewish experience in the diaspora that, into some degree, is being addressed by these artists.”
While the in-person exhibit will remain installed in the lobby of Adas Israel Congregation through May 14, the virtual presentation can be accessed online at any time. The combination of formats has allowed conversation around the exhibit to flourish, according to Bettman.
“It feels to me like the most important thing that’s occurred is that we, who have been part of this exhibit, have been brought into dialogue with each other in a way that allows us to be our identities in diverse ways, and that feels really successful. That feels really good to me,” Bettman said.
While seeing art in person is often preferable, the exhibition’s online format offered a unique opportunity to curate an intentional and meaningful viewing experience for the audience, according to Soltes.
“The nice thing about the online exhibit is it can follow the conceptual order of the catalog, and so someone can see the exhibit as I ideally would want you to see it,” Soltes said. “If you choose to go from beginning to end, you’re kind of walking along with me in the way I was thinking about it.”

Georgetown University has shifted two previously upperclass residence halls to the first-year residential community, sparking frustration among rising sophomores concerned about their future housing options. 
Reynolds Hall and Copley Hall, formerly upperclass dorms, will transition to first-year halls beginning in the fall 2021 semester, according to Bill Huff, director of residential services. These residential communities will join Darnall Hall, New South and Harbin Hall as first-year dorms, while Village C West will transition from a first-year to an upperclass hall. 
Many rising sophomores are concerned about the change, according to Natalie Gilbert (COL ’24).
“It feels unfair that Copley will be given to freshmen,” Gilbert said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “Personally, I have a group of friends that had hoped to get a Copley suite so that we could be connected to each other while still having our own roommates. And Copley is now for freshmen that don’t have big groups like that, so now it takes those spots away from people that do.” 
Copley Hall includes many suites with two double-occupancy rooms connected by a shared bathroom, distinguishing the hall from upperclass dorms like Southwest Quad’s Kennedy and McCarthy Halls, which only have traditional single, double or triple rooms with communal bathrooms. Before this shift, there were no first-year living communities with suite-style rooms. 
The goal of these changes is to offer more housing variety to first-year students while maintaining comfortable housing for all students, according to Huff.
“The adjustments will ensure that the University continues to provide attractive, safe and comfortable spaces conducive to student formation and community building for all students while creating more equity of housing types for incoming first year students,” Huff wrote in an email to The Hoya.
While Copley will no longer be available for sophomore students, Village C East, which offers double rooms with private bathrooms, will remain an option. The university fully renovated both VCE and VCW in the past year, including lobby renovations that created additional community and study space, according to Huff. 
While rooms in VCE and VCW have private bathrooms, their average square footage — at about 200 and 186 square feet — is less than the average Copley room’s 212 square feet. 
Upperclass students will continue to live in McCarthy Hall and Kennedy Hall. Rooms in these buildings are also smaller than Copley rooms, with an average size of 176 square feet. 
For Katarina Junod (SFS ’24), the fact that the university will provide first-year students with larger rooms and additional private bathrooms is frustrating.
“I feel like the change in housing of sophomore housing going to freshmen will mean that some sophomores will have housing that is worse than freshmen housing. That feels unfair,” Junod said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya.
While other suite- and apartment-style buildings are available for upperclass students, these traditionally go to juniors and seniors, as rising sophomores’ fewer housing selection points limit their options. Without Copley, sophomores’ only options are traditional dorm rooms.
According to Junod, the communication process surrounding the changes to residence halls was lacking and may prevent sophomores from making informed decisions about their housing. In recent weeks, Residential Living held several information sessions about housing for students and plans to hold more in the near future, according to a university spokesperson.
The administration should have provided more information to rising sophomores, according to Junod.
“I feel like you have to go to other people that are upperclassmen to understand what is going on with housing, and I don’t feel like that should be an issue. I feel like Georgetown should properly communicate what’s happening with housing,” Junod said. 

Rowlie Flores says 
May 8, 2021 at 10:21 pm
Why is LXR still a sophomore housing and why is Copley turned into a freshman housing? I feel like Copley creates a more, private sense of living and will make it hard for incoming first years to interact with other students in their year.

Students from the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy developed a proposal that will help small businesses in Washington, D.C., stay open amid the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and gentrification.
Lindsey Volz (GRD ’22) and Nicholas Stabile (GRD ’21) won the seventh annual Georgetown Public Policy Challenge, an event hosted by the McCourt School designed to encourage graduate students to critically address issues of public life in D.C. Their winning proposal, titled “Buy Your Own Building,” outlines a plan to combat gentrification and the economic consequences small businesses have faced during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Volz and Stabiles’ plan guarantees small businesses the right of first refusal, which ensures that landlords who are selling their property offer the opportunity to purchase the building to the business owners first. The plan also proposes gifting grants to small businesses in Wards 7 and 8. Winners of the challenge receive $2,500 to be used in implementing their proposals. 
The ultimate goal of “Buy Your Own Building” is to address the problems of gentrification and economic instability that small businesses in the District face, according to Stabile.
“It’s important to address lack of capital for small businesses, particularly for Black- and minority-owned businesses,” Stabile said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “Mitigating gentrification and displacement pressures and sort of allowing small businesses that have sort of been at the heart of a lot of communities to continue to stick around even as rents rise in D.C. is also important.” 
Inspiration for the winning proposal came from the impact of COVID-19 on small businesses. Since March 2020, 375 businesses have closed in the District, according to the DCist. 
In particular, the majority Black populations of Wards 7 and 8 have faced disproportionate barriers amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Residents find themselves facing a pattern of being underserved by the D.C. government. Compared to majority-white areas, like Ward 2, residents of Wards 7 and 8 have faced low vaccine availability. Further, these wards have experienced heightened economic hardship amid the pandemic and business closures.
The Public Policy Challenge allows graduate students to investigate issues that impact local neighborhoods and talk to community members who have lived in the District for their entire lives, according to Jaclyn Clevenger, associate director of student affairs at the McCourt School and director of the challenge.
“This is really an opportunity to learn about D.C. and the local issues that are happening here in the District and figure out ways to address them,” Clevenger said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
Past winning proposals include an initiative to assist homeless parents and their children in the District in 2020 and an effort to reduce asthma rates in the District in 2019. 
Volz and Stabile looked to Check It Enterprises, an apparel business that supports LGBTQ youth in Anacostia and secured funds from the District in order to buy their building, for a roadmap for their proposal.Check It Enterprises received $2 million from the city in 2020, which allowed the business to remain in its building and own the property.The “Buy Your Own Building” proposal would afford this same opportunity to all small businesses, Volz and Stabile said. 
Gentrification and the long-lasting impacts of redlining, the practice of refusing mortgages to people in certain neighborhoods, can be combated through property ownership, according to Ronald Moten, a partner with Check It Enterprises. 
“There are few places like Anacostia,” Moten said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We need to make sure we preserve the culture and the business owners with something where they will be owners, not renters.” 
Volz and Stabiles’ winning proposal has the potential to positively impact the lives of small business owners and employees in the District, while also addressing crucial problems like gentrification that business owners face, according to Clevenger.  
“It’s just so needed in D.C. communities to have that longevity, to have these local businesses as part of our neighborhoods,” Clevenger said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “My hope is that their project will really help D.C. residents in need keep their small businesses in D.C.” 
If “Buy Your Own Building” becomes a reality, small businesses throughout D.C. could benefit from property ownership, according to Volz. 
“There is real community support,” Volz said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “It was built off of actual feedback we’ve gotten, which is really cool because it is something where we can speak to people in the community going forward and hopefully push some version of this to actually being a possibility.”

Georgetown University students overwhelmingly voted in favor of implementing a metro pass program that would provide students with unlimited rides on select Washington, D.C. public transportation.
The Georgetown University Student Association Election Commission announced May 1 that 84.03% of voters approved of the referendum, which calls for the university to implement the University Pass Program, an initiative with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority that provides students at participating D.C. schools with an unlimited number of discounted rides on Metrobus and Metrorail services.
The program will help to increase accessibility on Georgetown’s campus, according to GUSA Senator Leo Rassieur (COL ’22), who introduced the referendum in the GUSA Senate.
“This confirms what we already knew—that the vast majority of students will make use of the Metro U-Pass and believe that it will help make a more equitable and accessible Georgetown,” Rassieur wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Typically, Metrorail fares for single rides range from $2 to $6, and the Metrobus costs $2.00 per ride, which can pose accessibility challenges for students who rely on public transportation for off-campus work. The U-Pass program will ensure that low-income students can access internships and jobs in D.C. that are outside of the Georgetown area, according to the referendum.
“For students with jobs or internships in the city, this can easily amount to $20 every week, if not significantly more, presenting a hidden financial barrier to the unique experiences that studying at Georgetown can offer,” the referendum reads.
To implement the program, the referendum calls for the university to add a $136 semesterly charge to tuition for every student. The charge would not affect students on full financial aid, students not taking classes on Georgetown’s main campus or disabled students, according to the text of the referendum. Currently, disabled people are able to ride any MetroRail service at reduced fares, under the Reduced Fare SmarTrip program.
The referendum’s passage does not guarantee the program will be implemented, but the university will consider the proposal, according to a university spokesperson.
“We are pleased to be working with GUSA and GradGov to explore the idea of joining Metro’s U-Pass program,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Student referendums help to express important student perspectives but do not create University policy and are not binding on the University.”
Regardless of whether the program is implemented, some students are concerned about the $136 semesterly cost, particularly considering that not all students will need to use public transport on a regular basis. 
For other students, like former GUSA senator Connor Brennan (SFS ’22), who supported the program during his tenure in the senate, but no longer does, the program is not feasible because of the lack of metro stops nearby campus. A better solution would be for Georgetown to directly fund students with transportation needs, according to Brennan.
“Georgetown has no nearby metro stations—the nearest access is if you wish to walk to Foggy Bottom or take the GUTS bus down to Rosslyn,” Brennan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The actual usage of this program would not be much, and, again, for those who do use the metro, it would be significantly less expensive for Georgetown to allocate funds to cover their expenses.”
Despite some of the concerns raised, Rassieur and other GUSA senators who worked on the referendum plan to meet with Georgetown administrators to discuss implementing the program. The senators plan to propose a trial run for the program during either the fall 2021 semester or the spring 2022 semester in which students could opt in, according to Rassieur.
If Georgetown ultimately decides to implement the program, it would join American University in offering the U-Pass program to students. American University first implemented the program in 2016, and its students have used a total of 1.5 million Metro rides through the program.
For Rowlie Flores (COL ’22), a GUSA senator who helped write the referendum, the benefits of the program outweigh many of the concerns voiced by students. 
“When agreeing to write this referendum, I also considered cost as a factor, but ultimately realized that the reason why students have low metro-usage right now is because of its cost,” Flores wrote in an email to The Hoya “It is our hope that a discounted cost could incentivize students into using the service.”

A Georgetown University committee found that the representation of diverse authors included among course syllabi in the Master of Science in Foreign Service program increased during the spring 2021 semester.
The Master of Science in Foreign Service Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee was founded last summer in the wake of George Floyd’s murder and the Black Lives Matter movement to address long-standing systemic inequities in the graduate program. The committee’s work is divided among six components including student engagement and support, institutional responses, staff and faculty, curricular and co-curricular activities, recruitment and admissions, and career support, according to a June 2020 letter from MSFS leadership.
The committee conducted a comprehensive audit of MSFS professors’ course syllabi from the fall 2020 and spring 2021 semesters. The Spring 2021 Syllabus Review showed an increase in female authors, international authors and authors of color included on syllabi. However, despite the increases, the results indicated that white men still constitute the largest percentage of this authorship. The largest identity group of authors, on average across classes, were white men at 47.1%, followed by white women at 21.6%, international men of color at 10.1% and international women of color at 5.2%.  
The syllabus review is a part of the committee’s curriculum component, which seeks to foster greater inclusivity in the MSFS program, according to Shanta Devarajan, DEI committee chair and International Development Concentration chair.
“The overall ambition is to increase the representation of people of color, and women as well, in the reading and the syllabi of our courses,” Devarajan said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “A second, maybe more important goal is to bring in perspectives that are more representative of cultures outside the traditional white male Euro-American perspective.”
For this semester’s review, a group of around 20 MSFS students led the review of authorship on course readings under the supervision of one faculty member. Results are based on a combination of professors’ self-reports and students’ independent research for courses in which professors were unable to participate, according to committee members.
The goal of this year’s survey was to establish a starting point for increasing diversity in curriculum and encourage faculty to start thinking about their syllabi, according to MSFS Director of Academic and Faculty Affairs Rebecca Caro, who worked as the students’ academic adviser during the review.
“We’re really aware that there’s no perfect way to group people into categories based on their identities,” Caro said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “This wasn’t really meant to say to faculty: ‘you’re not doing a good job,’ but more for faculty to reflect on what their syllabus looks like.”
The Fall 2020 Syllabus Review found that, on average, white male authors accounted for 56% of syllabi readings, while women and men of color authored a combined 15%. The categories identifying international authors were only added in the spring survey. 
Initially, the committee hoped to use the survey’s results to establish benchmarks and goals for representation in future syllabi. However, after collecting this semester’s results, setting benchmarks may be an unrealistic goal, according to Caro.
“As we’ve moved forward, I think that’s become harder for us to implement because we’re realizing that these categories are really fluid and there’s no way to really capture everything,” Caro said. “But we certainly want to see improvements in all of our underrepresented categories. That’s our goal moving forward, to improve in those percentages, and for faculty to be looking at their syllabi each semester, which sometimes they don’t.”
However, diverse authorship is only a starting point in establishing an anti-racist curriculum and does not necessarily equate to diverse values and beliefs, according to assistant professor Arjun Shankar, a member of the SFS Faculty Anti-Racism Working Group.
“The whole point of rigorous diversity is to change something about the foundations of our system because we know that there is something flawed about it. ” Shankar said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I don’t like the word diversity because I think it’s much more about optics and potential for accumulation. When you say diversity, it’s almost short-circuiting the more important conversation, which is how do we be anti-racist.”
Despite these concerns, students are hopeful that the committee will successfully build an anti-racist curriculum in the MSFS. Future students should continue to take leadership in work toward greater inclusion at the program, according to Amanda Suarez (GRD ’21), one of three students currently on the DEI committee.
“I really want the committee to be institutionalized and to be a sustainable body that continues to grow and act and advance this constructive and inclusive framework, to keep that momentum going,” Suarez said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
The well rounded and culturally diverse education that the DEI committee emphasizes is essential for students to better understand the communities they hope to serve after graduation, according to Suarez.
“It’s very key that we have this cultural competency, not only focusing on the representation of the student body or the faculty, but what we’re learning through the curriculum, what we’re doing, the culture and how we’re interacting in the classroom and on campus,” Suarez said.
