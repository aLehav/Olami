Washington, D.C., is failing to attract a young and educated workforce, according to a recent survey from the Roadmap for the Washington Region’s Economic Future.
While D.C. is still the most popular first destination after graduation for Georgetown students, according to the Cawley Career Education Center, the study reports that recent graduates are increasingly moving to other cities.
Data for the study, collected from May to October 2015, aimed to identify D.C.’s opportunities and challenges in boosting its economic growth.
The study revealed that D.C. maintains a competitive advantage in its connectivity to the world, high quality of life and occupational specialization. However, qualitative conclusions suggest the District needs to rebrand itself as a good place to do business and improve living conditions for young professionals.
Ellen Harpel (SFS ’88), a business consultant who helped lead the study, pointed out that both job market prospects and living environments matter in enhancing the city’s competitiveness in appealing to young professionals.
“Keeping and attracting talent is critical. Our research suggests that the Washington region needs to continue to offer fantastic career opportunities, but also needs to focus on how to keep it a great place to live,” Harpel said.
According to the Roadmap, D.C.’s economy has grown on the basis of information and knowledge industries. From 2003 to 2014, the fastest-expanding industries were business and financial services at 38.9 percent, biology and health technology at 25.1 percent, legal, public, social and other advocacy services at 19 percent and science and security technology at 18.6 percent.
In a report by the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University, D.C.’s job growth from 2014 to 2015 is slightly below 2 percent, which places the city in 10th place among the 15 cities with the largest job markets.
The lasting association between the city and federal government may be a negative factor in attracting workers. Conclusions in the Roadmap study suggest that the city develop nonfederally dependent and export-oriented industries to maintain its economic growth.
D.C.’s high population turnover rate may be linked to the city’s longtime focus on government and professional business activities. According to 2014 census records, D.C.’s ratio of residents who lived in a different state a year ago to the residents who stayed for more than one year was 0.09, compared to 0.01 for New York, 0.01 for California and 0.02 for Massachusetts.
Georgetown students, specifically, are increasingly headed to other cities after graduation. The Cawley Career Education Center’s annual senior class reports indicate that while the D.C.-Virginia-Maryland and the New York-New Jersey regions continue to be the top destinations for graduates, the number of those moving to California, Massachusetts, Illinois and Texas is steadily growing.
For example, since 2010, the percentage of graduating seniors moving to California has jumped from four to 7 percent. Massachusetts witnessed an increase from 2 percent to 5 percent and Illinois from one percent to three percent.
Despite the study’s findings, D.C. still boasts high educational attainment rates. Research from Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce indicates that the city’s job market favors highly educated workers. Among the online advertisements for jobs in the District, 72 percent require a bachelor’s degree, compared with the national average at 48 percent.
“[The] D.C. market has always been a job market for college graduates … mainly because of the business in the federal government and the jobs in consulting and [financial] businesses,” Tamara Jayasundera, research professor and senior economist at the McCourt School of Public Policy, said.
Sidharth Sharma (SFS ’16) said the demographic trends from the Roadmap’s survey possibly reflect the city’s inability to generate a sense of belonging.
“People I know who are from the D.C. area, their parents moved here for something government-related, and they themselves do not plan on staying here,” Sharma said. “If I was interested in anything else besides government and international relations, I wouldn’t want to stay here.”
Other students said the strong focus on the government sector deters the city from developing a dynamic social atmosphere.
Javier Gonzales (SFS ’16), who hopes to move to New York City after graduation, expressed his desire to see more diversity in D.C.
“I think the city has a certain feel to it that doesn’t stand for cultural diversity,” Gonzales said. “It’s always been the center of government, the center of power, and it always attracts a certain kind of people.”
Emily Kent (COL ’16) also said she hopes to move to New York or London because of the cities’ cultural richness.
“When I’m in a place like New York or London, I feel like I am encountering so many things I can do as a person who lives there,” Kent said. “D.C. doesn’t feel like a cultural center to me.”
Maurice McCaulley (SFS ’16), however, knew he wanted to stay in D.C. after graduation after his junior year. He said he believes that while D.C. is a busy city, it still provides an atmosphere conducive to personal connections between people.
“You still have the chance to meet and network with people in a more genuine way.” McCaulley said. “[New York City] is too much, too impersonal, too fast.”

You do realize DC extends beyond Burleith and Georgetown, right?

This article could just read “Hyper-Privileged Moving Out: Georgetown Grads decide DC’s 12+ museums, stunning monuments, and massive green spaces aren’t ‘attractive’ enough anymore, place the burden of their exodus on Washington DC ‘inadequacies’ instead of their own absurdly high expectations.”

It is slightly odd to suggest that DC, which literally has representatives of every country on the planet through embassies and organizations like the World Bank, and which has also long been known as a center of African-American culture, somehow “doesn’t stand for cultural diversity.”

Perhaps if you wanted insight from people actually from the DC area, you should have asked them. 
PS – to experience some “culture” (however arbitrarily you might be defining the term), you may want to check out some of the places the metro can take you.

“The number of those moving to California, Massachusetts, Illinois and Texas is steadily growing.”
Maybe because a large proportion of students are from those states and moving home? The percent increases are small enough that I won’t believe this is relevant and not normal variation until I see hometown demographics for the classes of 2010-2015.

Also…not to harp on this article (or to harp), but this article purports that the only industries in DC are government related. Huge global companies, including Capital One, Mars Candy, Hilton Hotels, Marriott Hotels, AES Corp, Capital One, Discovery Communications, and the Carlyle Group, among others, are all based in DC. Furthermore, with the NIH and its ilk, there is a robust job market for sciences-related jobs in the city.

Thousands of students walk in and out the doors of Lauinger Library every day, but few know the inner workings that allow students to search a book or collection, print a document or conduct research.
Over the past few years, the Joseph Mark Lauinger Memorial Library has expanded its collection and services to attend to the needs of students and faculty in an increasingly digitized community.
Lauinger Library is comprised of the main general book collection, the Booth Family Center for Special Collections, the Woodstock Library, the Gelardin Media Center, the Writing Center and Midnight MUG, a coffee shop run by Students of Georgetown, Inc.
It takes a staff of 105 people to manage the library and the 30,000 new books that arrive each year. The library also employs 100 to 125 additional student workers annually.
University Librarian Artemis Kirk oversees the library’s operations. This year, the university hired Ryan Johnson as its head of collections, research and instruction.
Having served as the head of information services at the University of Mississippi for the past 10 years, Johnson said his goal is to keep Lauinger up-to-date with changes in the education world, including open access and digitalization.
“I’m going to work with this department to … provide the best well-rounded collections [and] set of collection services for the students and faculty,” Johnson said.
Kirk said that the library draws on sources across a diverse range of subject matters and issue areas.
“We first and foremost support all of the disciplines that are taught at Georgetown and all of the research aspects of Georgetown’s major work,” Kirk said. “We’re not just buying course materials nor materials for particular disciplines. We are taking all of this into account.”
According to its staff, one of the biggest challenges facing Lauinger Library is its increasingly limited space. Over the past few years, the library has shifted its focus to procuring e-books.
In 2003, fewer than 500 of the library’s 1.7 million volumes were e-books. Today, the Main Campus libraries house around 1.26 million e-books, more than 1.3 million microforms and constantly growing collections of audiovisual materials, photographs, government documents and electronic databases.
The library also provides access to online databases, in addition to a 3D printer in Gelardin, which was installed last year.
Aside from the procurement of new materials, the university also expanded its services to students and faculty over the past years.
According to Johnson, librarians work closely with professors to ensure that students have access to publications that will complement their curriculum.
“We always … find the materials that meet the teaching, learning and research needs of the community we’re working with,” Johnson said. “We track what books are used and how they’re used so we can get a sense for how the students or the faculty are making use of the collection, so we can then tweak it to better meet some of their needs.”
Students and faculty can request books from the School in Foreign Service in Qatar library to be delivered to the Main Campus.
In 2014, librarians answered more than 19,000 reference questions posed by students. More than 1 million website visitors accessed almost 6 million library web pages.
Much of the digital information is leased from aggregators or accessed through the Washington Research Library Consortium. The consortium is a nonprofit organization that includes eight other D.C. universities, including American University, the Catholic University of America, the George Washington University and Howard University.
This year, Lauinger Library has a combined operating budget of $6.5 million. Each year, it receives a base amount from the university for its regular collections. Special collections are sustained through special funds, endowments and donations.
Library archives have continued to grow in the field of special collections in recent years. In March, the Booth Family Center for Special Collections opened after the library received a $3 million grant from Georgetown parents Suzanne Deal Booth and David G. Booth and an additional $2 million in various private donations.
The center adds onto the library’s extensive archive collection. The archive collection, which was founded in 1816, is one of the oldest university archives in the country. According to Kirk, every nonconventional, unique and rare object, including manuscripts, rare books and other art, is held in these archives.
“These [artifacts] are the things that kind of distinguish one university research library from another,” Kirk said. “Not just size, but what you’ve got that’s really quite unique and relevant to the mission of your institution. That’s where we focus.”
Student Library Assistant Brynlee Norton (COL ’19) said her favorite part of the job is organizing special collections and observing pictures of exclusive events that involvr presidents, prime ministers and military leaders.
“My first day I got to go into the rare books closet and on that day I got to see a complete set of first- edition Charles Dickens novels as well as a really giant book from the 13th century that monks probably inscribed,” Norton said. “So that was really cool to see.”

The picture on the phone screen is blurry, but unmistakable: At a window, a silhouette materializes out of emerald light, its green, hollow eyes aimed fixedly at the camera. It resembles a specter of some sort.
Or at least, so reasons Mike Harden. In his three years as a guide for the Ghosts of Georgetown tour, he has collected two ghostly images on his cell phone — one captured by a guest two weeks ago at the Halcyon House on Prospect Street NW, the other taken near M Street NW’s famous Old Stone House. He brandishes the photographs as a final flourish on the hour-and-a-half-long expedition, where skeptics are invited to suspend their incredulity during a macabre march through Georgetown’s most eerie haunts.
“I love this tour,” Harden said. “It’s definitely the most fun one that I give.”
Harden said the nightly tours attract thousands of guests, who trace a mile-long route starting at the Old Stone House and ending at the Exorcist Steps. The groups walk past West Georgetown landmarks while Harden discusses the history of the different locations.
Tours operate under the umbrella company Free Tours by Foot. The company has offered D.C. tours since 2007 and has expanded internationally, now including cities such as San Francisco, London and Rome.
For $13, a Ghosts of Georgetown tour participant hears stories about vengeful spirits wreaking havoc in the mansions of unsuspecting families, curses that foretold the untimely demise of an American president every 20 years and ghosts summoned by Georgetown University students through Ouija boards.
One of the stops is outside the Halcyon House, allegedly the most haunted location in the city. Mark Twain’s nephew Albert Clemens inhabited the home in the early 20th century, constantly altering the building with seemingly nonsensical renovations, including staircases to nowhere and doors leading to brick walls. According to Harden, Clemens believed perpetually rebuilding the house extended his own life. Although Clemens died in 1938, Harden said the ghost’s presence is so potent it compelled the founder of the Ghosts of Georgetown tour, Canden Schwantes Arciniega, to refuse to continue as a guide after a supernatural encounter.
Since Clemens’ death, the structure has been sold multiple times, even being used as a university dormitory from 1961 to 1966. Since 2011, the Halycon House has been used as headquarters for S&R Foundation, a nonprofit organization.
“Two years ago, Canden gave the tour to a group of young boys for an 11-year-old’s birthday party, and as she crosses in front of the house, she sees three rope nooses hanging from the fourth-floor window, and as she scans the windows she see a man in a black robe and a wide-brimmed black hat, with a long grey beard and blood- red eyes who lifts a finger to point at her. She screamed and left the boys to fend for themselves, and has declared she’ll never give a tour again,” Harden said.
Visitors often report perceiving otherworldly figures or orbs during the tour, or sensing sudden chills.
One particular ghost — the apparition of former Union General Irvin McDowell — is reported to exclusively bother brunette long-haired young female visitors along the tour. According to legend, his brown-haired lover, Confederate spy Betty Duvall, betrayed him during the Battle of Bull Run.
“As we walked through the tour one night, I was talking to a young girl and I believe I saw a ghostly hand brush her hair to the side and I saw her shiver,” Harden said. “I waited until we crossed the street to tell her what had happened, and I never saw her again.”
Miquita Parker from Laurel, Md., attended the tour to satisfy her curiosity about the supernatural aspects of the District. She said she identifies as a believer in ghosts after two experiences in her childhood.
“When I was three, I remember seeing this figure at my window with all this crazy hair. I woke up crying, and when I called my mom and she said, ‘Oh, that was your grandma,’” Parker said. “I wasn’t scared then because I was so young. … So for me, I definitely believe, which is what made the tour even more interesting.”
Eric Sellers (GRD ’15), who joined Parker on the tour, highlighted it as an opportunity to explore Georgetown from a perspective he had not experienced as a graduate student.
“I enjoyed all the stories, especially about the Civil War,” Sellers said. “I enjoyed the fact that [Harden] knew all these stories about the different areas of Georgetown and the backstories, and instead of just telling us the scary part we also got a history lesson. Because I went to Georgetown, I wanted to find out more information about the stories here.”
Though he said he believes in ghosts since they are mentioned in the Bible, Sellers said ghost tours command popular appeal among believers and skeptics alike because morbid curiosity is inherent in human nature. “I think people go on ghost tours for the same reason that they like going to the theater. They like being scared,” Sellers said. “They look forward to that fear, they want to see if it’s real, they want to satisfy that curiosity. It’s just fear, this weird or creepy feeling that you know something isn’t right. I think that’s what makes it scary, the ambiguity. It’s definitely an adrenaline rush.”
Joshua Han (SFS ’18) said he has seen the tours walking by and sees their appeal, but does not believe in the myths surrounding the Georgetown neighborhood.
“I don’t believe in ghosts, but I think that these ghost tours are pretty interesting,” Han said. “If you walk by the Exorcist steps late at night, you can’t help but feel there’s something spooky about it.”

Uber introduced UberPool, a feature that allows users heading in the same direction to share an UberX vehicle and split the fare, to Washington D.C. Oct. 22.
Instead of deciding between UberX or UberBlack, users may now select the UberPool option, enter a pickup and drop-off location and match with another user on the same route. Additionally, UberPool riders are guaranteed the cost of their trip, regardless of whether an extra passenger is picked up along the way.
The company claims that UberPool will be 25 percent cheaper than UberX, which already costs 40 percent less than a taxi, on average. The creation of the service stems from Uber’s goal to be more cost-effective.
“We’re aiming particularly at those who haven’t tried Uber before, maybe because of the cost,” Zuhairah Washington, Uber’s general manager for the D.C. area, told D.C. Inno last week. “Our goal is to continuously grow the pie of users.”
However, the range of UberPool is significantly smaller than the traditional services Uber offers. UberPool will only service the D.C. Metro area and several outlying suburbs. Additionally, it will transport users to and from Dulles International Airport but will not stop in neighborhoods between the airport and the District Line.
D.C. is the sixth U.S. city to unveil UberPool after San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Austin and Boston. In San Francisco, almost half of all trips in the city use UberPool since the program debuted three months ago.
Washington cited its success in San Francisco and expressed optimism that the feature will also gain popularity in D.C.
“We have seen it proven to be the most affordable product. We expect the same in D.C., with prices that are considerably less than UberX for riders,” Washington said to D.C. Inno. “The long-term vision is for this to be a product that allows us to bring down the price even further.”
She added that the company noticed high demand for UberPool.
“We’ve had more requests for its prelaunch here than other cities,” Washington said. “D.C. is known for embracing innovation and tech and carpooling is a popular concept itself.”
Additionally, Uber spokesperson Taylor Bennet told The Washington Post the company also aims to contribute to reducing congestion and pollution in the city by encouraging carpooling.
“This is a part of Uber’s larger vision helping take cars off the road and providing a more affordable way to getting around, not having to rely on personal vehicles or on other transportation options that aren’t as reliable or effective,” Bennet said. “D.C. is a city that is faced with significant traffic congestion. … We hope this is a way to tackle that issue and reduce the congestion.”
Barry, a local UberPool driver who chose not to provide his last name for job security reasons, believes the new feature will significantly improve conversation in his car.
“Today’s life is about connectivity, so it depends on whom you are sitting with. That guy might be a friend for life,” Barry said. “If Uber did not think it would help people, I don’t think they would have done it.”
Zach Durkin (SFS ’17) expressed optimism about the convenience and cost of the new feature.
“UberPool is going to be great, especially for college kids without cars because it makes getting into D.C. much more inexpensive, which I am really excited about,” Durkin said.
Clayton Smith (MED ’18) also pointed to the cost-saving potential of the option.
“Yeah, I’ll use it for things like going to the airport, but I haven’t tried it yet, though,” Smith said. “I think when [UberPool] catches on it will be [worth it] but in the beginning it won’t be very cost-effective.”
Caitlyn Cobb (COL ’18), however, doubts she will use this feature, given the current rideshare feature that allows users to split fares with each other.
“I already split fares when I’m riding with a group of people, and that’s pretty straightforward,” Cobb said. “I don’t see why I would use the new feature.”

Twenty-five percent of D.C. Public Schools 10th-graders who took the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers in English and 10 percent of students who took the test in geometry demonstrated proficiency in each subject, indicating low levels of college and career readiness and revealing potential flaws within the Common Core curriculum.
The results show a discrepancy in performance among demographics; white students, who make up around 10 percent of the citywide sophomore class, generally outscored the minority students who took the exam.
DCPS adopted Common Core standards five years ago in an attempt to increase the range and rigor of education in public schools nationwide. The District, along with 11 states, developed the PARCC as a replacement for other standardized tests to evaluate student progress toward set standards in English and mathematics.
According to DCPS Press Secretary Michelle Lerner, school administrators expected the poor performance scores.
“These results are sobering, but we were not surprised by these results,” Lerner wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are holding ourselves and our students to a high standard and our first outcomes show that we have a great deal of work to do. Again, we are making strong investments in our teachers, our curriculum and our schools. We expect these scores to improve each year.”
Lerner hopes that higher expectations from teachers and school officials will help drive student academic progress.
“We know that if we set the bar high, our students can meet that standard,” Lerner wrote. “We have a lot of work ahead of us to prepare our students, but we know that we will continue to make steady progress toward that goal.”
Jane Hannaway, a McCourt School of Public Policy professor and founding director of the National Center for the Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research, said the scores do not represent the gains made by DCPS in the past years.
“Historically, D.C. schools have been very low performers,” Hannaway said. “That shows up in the regular standardized tests. But in gains, they’re way ahead of the game.”
She highlighted the 2015 National Assessment of Education Progress as evidence of improvement; in it, fourth-graders jumped seven points in reading and three points in math overall since 2013.
Hannaway said the scores may not accurately portray the value of the Common Core, given that the standards have not had time to take full effect.
“These level scores are tricky because learning begets learning,” Hannaway said. “The real test is going to come when we start looking at the performances of kids who have been in the system for a number of years.”
Cary Finnegan, the Center for Social Justice program director for D.C. Reads, agreed that the new standards for public schools need more time to show noticeable results. Finnegan added that  poor performance scores on this particular exam may not be valid representations of college and career readiness.
“If the data was showing better numbers, but on a less rigorous assessment, that would not mean good things for DCPS students as they enter college or the workforce unprepared,” Finnegan wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The vast majority of students who took the exam were minorities. Less than 10 percent of PARCC test-takers were white. However, white students drastically outperformed minority peers.
Six percent of the English test-takers were white, and 82 percent of their scores indicated college and career readiness. In comparison, of the 78 percent of test takers who were black, only 20 percent scored in this range.
Additionally, Hispanic students made up 13 percent of test-takers, with only 25 percent labeled as college-and-career-ready.
In the math section of the PARCC exam, the scores showed a similar pattern. White students made up eight percent of the test takers, and 52 percent of them demonstrated college and career readiness.
While 76 percent of the math test takers were black, only four percent passed. Again, Hispanic students made up 13 percent of the students taking the test; however, merely 8 percent of them were labelled college-and-career-ready.
Hannaway attributed the disparity to the fact that many minority students come from low-income families — a factor that greatly contributes to student achievement levels.
Finnegan said these test scores are an indication of the importance of the Center For Social Justice’s work in supporting students of low-income families.
“The data reaffirms that now more than ever, it is imperative that students consider ways that they can reach out and do work that will have a positive and meaningful impact on the greater D.C. community,” Finnegan wrote. “Whether it is a CSJ program or another GU program doing important work in D.C. communities, it is critically important that Georgetown students find ways to get involved and help schools prepare youth to be college and career ready.”
Morgan Trevett (COL ’19) is a member of the After School Kids Program, an initiative that mentors adjudicated youths in the D.C. area. The students Trevett works with are all enrolled in DCPS.
“The minority students that I work with come from some pretty low-income neighborhoods,” Trevett said. “I think that it’s really hard for them to reach their full potential, education-wise, because that’s not what they know.”
Despite the overall poor results, a few highly selective and charter schools in the District reported higher proficiency scores. Students at School Without Walls, a selective public high school, had proficiency rates of 76 percent in math and 97 percent in English.

The new W. Proctor Harvey Clinical Teaching Amphitheater at the Georgetown University Medical Center, a space that will host courses with more hands-on, clinical curricula, officially opened Oct. 23.
The School of Medicine will share the space with the hospital’s training program, and a set schedule for class use is not yet cemented.
Dean for Medical Education Dr. Stephen Mitchell said the emphasis on increasing the school’s clinical education is a concept the GUMC focused on with its $10 million renovation.
“The more teaching that’s done in a clinical context, the better,” Mitchell said. “Even if you’re learning basic science, you need to learn it as it applies to a patient.”
Around 600 individual donors contributed $8.5 million for renovations through various medical school initiatives. MedStar Health donated the remaining $1.5 million needed to finalize funding and in return will have access to the space for its own residents and interns.
Mitchell highlighted the alumni donors as the driving force behind the project’s completion.
“Over one alumni weekend, we had pledges for chairs, so we offered the 100 best seats in the house to honor the 100 best teachers,” Mitchell said. “We raised over $400,000 that weekend.”
The amphitheater’s namesake, Dr. W. Proctor Harvey,  GUMC for more than 30  years, starting in the 1950s. He pioneered cardiac auscultation – the practice of listening to a patient’s heart and diagnosing him based on any abnormalities in his heartbeat. Harvey would often open classes by playing a piece of classical music and asking students to pay attention to certain instruments to model the idea of auscultation.
Mitchell said Harvey was known for listening to patients’ literal hearts only after listening to their metaphorical hearts — their concerns and long-term needs — and that this unique approach is reflected in the amphitheater itself.
“I visit a lot of medical schools, and I would say right now that there is not another clinical teaching space like this in the country, if not the world,” Mitchell said.
The renovations included extensive technology additions to the amphitheater, including several 100-inch projector screens, multiple high-definition cameras and individual audio connection, broadband access and power outlets for each of the 300 seats.
Additionally, changes include a new concrete floor and ceiling panels designed for improved acoustics. The space includes 15-inch desks and an electric “sky wall,” which can be brought down to divide the space into two classrooms.
Harvey Amphitheater Project Manager Whitman Brown expressed hope that the new technology will help students gain a more practical knowledge of material.
“We actually have a digital stethoscope, so that you can have a live human being sitting on an exam table in the middle of the classroom. It broadcasts that person’s heart sounds to every headphone in the amphitheater,” Brown said. “So you can have 300 people sitting there listening to what a physician would be hearing in a stethoscope.”
Sarah Schuessler (MED ’19) said the amphitheater is popular among students, although it is not yet clear how often students will get to use it, given MedStar’s share of the space.
“It’s a beautiful space. I’m really excited about it, and I’m really happy that we have it,” Schuessler said. “I think there’s a little bit of a consensus among the medical students that we are happy to have it, but we are disappointed that we’re not getting to use it more.”

Educating Residents About Social Equality, a group sponsored by the Office of Residential Living that provides programming on equity and diversity to the university residential community, restructured its organization to include general membership positions for students this year.
Since it was founded in 2011, the organization has been run by residential assistants, community directors and students who apply for positions on the executive board. The advisory board also includes two staff advisors — Henle Village Community Director Jillian Sitjar and Village A Community Director Quintin Veasley — who assist in procuring funds from the university.
This year, students will be able to participate in different event planning committees without joining the board. The group will also host weekly general body meetings open to all students.
“At any time, individuals from the student body, whether on a whim or from promotion at an event that we host, are free to sit in on meetings and dedicate themselves to a committee they’d like,” ERASE President Anita Williams (COL ’17) wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In the past two years, ERASE has hosted a number of events and programs to promote dialogue on cultural diversity and social equity, with the goal of building more inclusive communities within all residence halls.
These programs include facilitated roundtable discussions on racial, gender and disability diversity, photo campaigns and open mic events.
The group hosted its first event this year, a study break in Sellinger Lounge, Oct. 27.
Several planned events for this year include social functions with hot chocolate and cookies and potlucks featuring cultural foods.
Williams said the group would like to engage students in discussions about diversity without giving the events specific labels.
“We definitely want to host some fun, engaging things that move beyond the somewhat static ‘dialogue’ space,” Williams wrote.
According to Williams, ERASE plans to host more events this year in partnership with a variety of student groups to improve relationships between student clubs and create a greater sense of community. The specific clubs have yet to be confirmed.
Williams said that the goal of ERASE is to help students engage with one another beyond their club affiliations.
“It’s not hard to notice that some of the cultural clubs keep to themselves, as well as some of the arts and sports groups,” Williams wrote. “We want to bridge that gap and provide a space that’s interactive and fun, tackles real issues with diverse opinions and transforms the relationships across the student body.”
In addition to collaborating with other student groups, ERASE partnered with the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access, which distributes newsletters and flyers across campus to help promote the group.
Every year, ERASE hosts a series of open mic events, in which students can perform music, poetry or other art in front of their peers.
Maria-Jose Nebreda (MSB ’19), who joined ERASE as a general body member this year, said she has been impressed with the group’s engagement with the university community.
“I was looking for ways to get involved in the action-based social justice side of Georgetown and ERASE was a way of me doing that,” Nebreda wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I liked that ERASE took into account the importance of intersectionality and that it seeks to create better relationships between student groups at Georgetown.”
Eliza McCurdy (COL ’17), who participated on the board of ERASE as a residential assistant in Darnall Hall last year, said while she enjoyed her experience working with the board, she thinks that the group can benefit from more marketing in the future.
“I really enjoyed the group of people who worked on it and thought they could get a lot done if they put their minds on it, but unfortunately, it worked out that people’s focuses seemed to be elsewhere,” McCurdy wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I think there is a lot of potential for ERASE in the future though if they can do a better job of getting the word out.”
Other nonmember students also praised the group’s efforts. Gina Kim (SFS ’18), a member of the Georgetown University Student Association Multicultural Council, said that she values ERASE’s programming.
“I think that ERASE is important because it strives to bring together a lot of different groups on campus,” Kim said. “I think that diversity and conversations on diversity are important to create voices for all on campus.”
Daniel Lysak (COL ’18), president of the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center Hall Council, said he thinks ERASE can help increase student involvement in important dialogues on campus.
“ERASE has the ability to become a powerful force for diversity and social equity, both of which are essential to making all Hoyas know that they are important, regardless of their backgrounds,” Lysak said. “Through active discussions in ERASE, I believe we can achieve this goal.”

A group of eight students will launch Georgetown’s first academic journal dedicated to history articles written by undergraduate and graduate students in early 2016.
The Georgetown Journal of History, which will release its first online issue in the spring, will consist of research articles on history from students at Georgetown and universities across the country. The journal will be published online once a year.
Cole Horton (SFS ’18) founded the journal this year and serves as its editor-in-chief. Horton leads an editorial board of six other undergraduate students and one graduate student to produce the journal. The undergraduate students consist of a mix of history majors and members of Georgetown’s chapter of Phi Alpha Theta, a national honor society for students and professors of history.
The editorial board received support from the history department, which gave Horton approval to start the journal and provided funding and help with soliciting submissions. Director of Undergraduate Studies in the History Department Tommaso Astarita will also help with editing articles.
The journal is seeking work from around 30 undergraduate institutions across the country, with preference given to submissions from Georgetown students. The journal will only accept graduate submissions from Georgetown graduate students. Submissions are open until Jan. 1, 2016.
Horton said he initially conceived the idea when he tried to publish his own history articles.
“After speaking with [my professor], I realized that Georgetown did not have an academic journal of history, which I was surprised about, because you would think that a university in D.C. would be in one of the strongest positions to solicit history [articles], just because of the city and Georgetown’s history itself,” Horton said.
Horton said undergraduate students are often at a disadvantage when trying to publish their work, as they are often competing against submissions from graduate students and scholars.
“One of the benefits of having an undergraduate journal is that you’re opening it up to students who have really great work, and just because of the nature of publishing in academic journals across the country, are often not prioritized in the publication process,” Horton said.
Justin Abello (COL ’17), a member of the editorial board, said the online nature of the journal and its focus on undergraduate articles will make the publication more accessible to undergraduate readers.
“We’re not just focusing on extensive research papers from graduate students or seniors. We’re also looking at those seven- to 10-page essays that someone might have written for a history course during their sophomore year,” Abello wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We think both types of pieces are able to make great contributions to the publication.”
Horton said that the journal will accept articles from history students from a range of backgrounds, including those in introductory courses.
“We think that that’s going to be a neat opportunity to involve an audience, a younger group of students that are not involved in any other journal that I know of,” Horton said.
Astarita praised the journal for providing students with the opportunity to become further involved in the academic community.
“I think it’s an interesting way to motivate students to sort of take some initiative in both their own learning but also kind of a community building of knowing what other history students are doing both here and elsewhere,” Astarita said.
Astarita also said that the journal’s editorial staff will benefit from the experience.
“For those who will be involved either as writers or as editors, it’s a kind of a professional experience of research and academic work that may not be directly related to all of their careers but will be a useful added skill that they will get to practice,” Astarita said.
Natalie Smith (GRD ’16), a student on the editorial board who is currently pursuing a master’s degree in global, international and comparative history, said the journal will connect history students in Georgetown with those in other universities.
“It will also be a venue where students from other schools can have their work published so it will create a great network of budding historians between Georgetown and other universities,” Smith wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Smith said the journal offers students an opportunity to develop skills that historians use.
“I think the journal will be a great opportunity for Georgetown students to showcase some of their work, get experience writing for [a] publication, working with editors … which is what a lot of being a historian is about so it’s great practice,” Smith wrote.
Leyla Izquierdo (COL ’18), who is currently enrolled in a history course, said the journal would complement existing history education by allowing students to learn about a variety of topics.
“I think it’s a great way to get other students informed on important events that happened in history without having to take the actual course,” Izquierdo said. “Exemplar papers would provide accurate information to students and thus enhance a student’s learning experience.”

According to a recent paper from assistant professor of biology Leslie Ries, monarch populations may not be disappearing, countering a long-held assumption in popular culture and the field of entomology.
As an indicator species, the migratory patterns of monarch butterflies point toward general trends in the environment. According to Ries, the resurgence of monarch butterflies may shed light on climate change.
“To understand the consequences of how things are changing is an important piece of information to have as we are trying to act,” Ries said.
Ries arrived at her conclusion after studying large-scale continental patterns of butterflies, using data from citizen scientists and groups of hobbyists who collect data for scientific usage. Ries has helped these programs manage and curate data for more than 10 years.
Ries said conflicting trends in her research caused her to doubt existing conceptions of monarch population decline.
“In the winter you see this big decline, and in the summer you don’t really see it. And so, more than anything, this suggests a new question like, ‘What do we really understand?’ ‘What is causing their decline?’” Ries said.
Ries also emphasized the importance of monarchs on overall North American migration patterns. As monarchs eat poisonous milkweed, the research provides insight on how insects use poison in order to be unpalatable for predators, such as birds.
In addition to her current research interests, Ries said it is important to study other animals to track long-term changes, including figuring out how the environment and climate are changing.
“We are able to take all these data sets that people have been collecting and the observations that people have been making for years and put all that data together in a way that helps us understand how things are changing,” Ries said.
Ries’ research focuses on two main areas: understanding how climate influences the monarchs and their year-to-year migration patterns, and studying temperature tolerances and population dynamics throughout migratory stages.
Ries said she will begin to carry out her studies on campus.
“At Georgetown, I will be starting up some of my own laboratory work, so I will start collecting my data,” Ries said.
Treasurer of EcoAction Zachary Larkin (SFS ’18) said research on monarch butterflies is important in ensuring the well-being of the entire environment.
“As a club focused on raising awareness for and trying to be a part of the solution for environmental issues, we certainly are excited about the positive news expressed by Ries’ research,” Larkin said. “Their presence in an ecosystem is essential for its health. From EcoAction’s perspective, this is another indication that taking care of the entire environment is important to ensure the health of all organisms,” Larkin said.
Anton Lulaj (COL ’18), a biology major, said changes to the butterfly species can have cascading effects on other parts of the ecosystem.
“In terms of the global perspective on climate change, looking at a species that is so pervasive around the world and that adapts so well to environmental change, we are seeing declines in population and changes in migratory patterns, which show that even the most resilient of species are being affected,” Lulaj said.
Ries said that there is still much work to be done regarding the changing patterns in the monarch butterfly populations.
“There are still a lot of questions we don’t know, and that’s true for the monarch as well. It’s a critical time for them and their populations do seem to be declining in an alarming way,” Ries said. “We do need to figure out what’s going on, and hopefully I can be a part of that.”
