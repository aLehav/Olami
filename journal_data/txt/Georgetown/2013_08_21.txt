The D.C. Department of Health closed the Georgetown Sweetgreen for health code violations Monday evening, and the restaurant remained closed through Tuesday.
Sweetgreen, located at 3333 M St. NW, posted a sign Monday evening indicating that the business was closed for violations of the food code.
According to the DOH inspection report, Monday’s inspection was a follow-up on a routine inspection August 5. The Department of Health found more than six critical violations of food code regulations, including an inaccessible hand-washing sink, a broken refrigerator, fruit flies and an expired business license.
The company’s Twitter account, however, said the restaurant would be closed for renovations and did not mention code violations.
After installing a new sink, Sweetgreen reopened Wednesday.
