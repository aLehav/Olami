Third Edition, the popular Georgetown restaurant and bar on Wisconsin Avenue, served its last drink this past Thursday night.
Known affectionately by students as Thirds, Third Edition was a staple weekend destination for generations of Georgetown students.
While famous for its brief 15 minutes of fame in the 1980’s hit St. Elmo’s Fire, Thirds has been known more recently for its crackdown on the use of fake IDs and plans to elevate its image beyond that of weekend watering hole for the college crowd.
The restaurant’s current management is in talks with Richard Sandoval Restaurants to turn the storefront into a higher profile dining destination, possibly a Mexican restaurant.

Georgetown students eager to make a splash in politics have no shortage of role models in Hilltop alumni. But it is rarer for alumni to throw their hats in the ring for the mayor’s office of the largest city in the country.
Joseph Lhota (MSB ’76) has entered the New York City mayoral race, whose November winner will replace current mayor Michael Bloomberg when he steps down at the end of the year.
Lhota, whose daughter Kathryn is a senior in the College, filed the necessary documents to register as a Republican candidate for the position Jan. 17 and has since revved up his campaign for the city’s top office, which will be decided on Nov. 5, 2013.
A longtime New York resident, Lhota was born in the Bronx and raised on Long Island. He then came to Washington, D.C., to study at Georgetown in 1972. Although he earned his degree in business administration, he says his time spent on the Hilltop helped guide him toward politics.
“As a Georgetown student in the ’70s, all of us were particularly interested in politics as an effective route for change at that time,” he said.
According to Lhota, 58, his experience in student government was an early indicator of his lifelong dedication to public service.
“I was part of the [Georgetown University Student Association] in the early stages of its creation,” he said. “I was the campaign manager for someone who was running for president of the student body, and I held the same position for another candidate the year before that. I think all of that certainly played a role in my doing some work on Capitol Hill after graduation.”
“It’s great to see that GUSA has such a storied history of producing people so highly influential in the political sphere, particularly in areas with such massive constituencies such as New York,” said Zachary Singer (SFS ’15), vice speaker of GUSA.
A few years after graduating from Georgetown, Lhota enrolled in Harvard Business School, where he earned his MBA in 1980, and followed that with 15 years on Wall Street.
Lhota noted that his principal motivation for running for New York’s mayoralty is his love for the city.
“My candidacy is a result of both my belief that I think that I offer more than the other candidates to best lead New York and my appreciation for the culture and community that make up this great city,” he said.
A current resident of Brooklyn Heights, Lhota holds strong family ties to the city. His father was a police lieutenant and his grandfather was a firefighter and taxi driver.
But Lhota himself is no stranger to serving the city. He worked as budget director in the administration of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and later as Giuliani’s deputy mayor in 1998.
“My experience working with Mayor Guiliani is only one factor in what better prepares me for this position in office,” Lhota said. “While not overwhelming, the position gave me an understanding of mayoral responsibilities and management that serves as a huge distinction from the other candidates.”
After a short hiatus from public service managing The Madison Square Garden Company, Lhotabecame the chairman and CEO of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 2011. Due to his success in preparing the city for Hurricane Sandy, Lhota and his campaign are reaping the benefits of his leadership during the crisis.
“It is no doubt how the MTA has performed and how quickly it has been able to return after the hurricane has been a major victory for the city,” he said. “It must be said that it was the workers who were greatly responsible for that success, but all summer long, the management team and I had been preparing for a situation like that, which led to our efficiency when the time came.”
Beyond the storm, Lhota said that he has emphasized a more user-friendly MTA, with improved facilities and more transparency for commuters. However, he was at the helm of the MTA, when the decision was made to increase subway and bus fares by a quarter — a move that could potentially hurt him with some voters.
But Lhota still has an almost heroic reputation over a decade after he raced towards Lower Manhattan to direct traffic after the Twin Towers were hit on Sept. 11.
While Lhota admitted that he has a big personality — he once gave the middle finger to a journalist, according to The New York Times — he says that he fits in among a long tradition of gregarious mayors.
“I think that great, outgoing mayors like Mayor Koch and Mayor Guiliani represent the city’s personality — loud, vibrant and going all the time,” he said.
Lhota may be challenged as a Republican candidate by a constituency widely made up of Democrats, but he said that he believes he can represent New York.
“I’m definitely a fiscal conservative, but when you look at my stance on social issues, they’re really quite progressive,” Lhota said. “We’ve had a Republican mayor for about twenty years now, and registration among city voters has not changed all that much. In my opinion, New Yorkers are very independent and they vote for the candidate, not the party line, and focus on campaigns based on the issues.”
The last Georgetown graduate to hold the top job in New York City government was Georgetown Law graduate John O’Brien, who served as its 98th mayor from 1933 to 1934.

Even though the 113th Congress has just begun, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), the District of Columbia’s non-voting representative to Congress, has already reintroduced a bill for D.C. statehood.
The New Columbia Admission Act, which Norton resubmitted Jan. 15, would formally create the state of New Columbia. The area would encompass the entirety of the District and include two senators and one representative.
Norton introduced the same bill during the last session of Congress as well as two decades ago when she was first sworn into Congress.
Four Democratic senators —  Tom Carper (D-Del.), Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) — introduced a companion bill to Norton’s in the Senate Jan. 24.
In the past, both houses of Congress have passed legislation to give the District a voting representative. However, neither house has passed such a bill in the same session so the proposals have never become law.
President Barack Obama has stated his support for granting the District voting rights and recently agreed to outfit his presidential limousines with standard D.C. license plates, which read “Taxation without Representation” in protest of the lack of autonomy.
The current legislation, however, faces significant obstacles.
“There is a political consideration,” Scott Fleming, Georgetown’s associate vice president for federal relations, said. “When you add two new senators and a voting member from the District of Columbia, that, even if very minimally, diminishes the clout of everyone else [in Congress].”
In addition, Fleming suggested that the District’s Democratic leanings could affect the bill’s future.
“There are those who might prognosticate which political party would likely win those seats, and that might influence some people’s decisions about whether they want further members of their body who share that political view,” he said.
As Norton begins her newest quest for statehood, District officials continue to take action toward autonomy in other forms. A referendum that would exempt the D.C. City Council from having to submit budgets for Congressional approval has been scheduled for April 23.
While the efforts to give the District voting representation in Congress are seen as likely to fail, the upcoming budget autonomy referendum represents a more realistic opportunity for increased District autonomy.
Even if voters approve the measure, it will likely be met with heavy legal resistance.
“Serious legal questions have been raised about the validity of the amendment,” D.C. Attorney General Irvin Nathan said in a letter to the Board of Elections.
Congressman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House committee responsible for D.C., said Dec. 5 that the budget changes proposed in the referendum would not be lawful, according to news site Roll Call.

Local grocery store and restaurant Dean and Deluca was closed today after violating the D.C. Food Code.
According to a notice posted on the establishment’s door, the Department of Health found that Dean and Deluca’s non-compliance with regulations posed an imminent health risk to the public.
This is not the first time that the store has had problems with food violations.
After a complaint was filed, the eatery had an inspection on Aug. 28, 2012 that found six critical violations, which is enough to close a restaurant if none of the errors can be corrected on site. The violations included no certified food protection manager on duty or posted, unclean food contact surfaces, unlabeled prepared food items and rough cutting boards with multiple grooves. The store, however, was able to fix a sixth observation that found uncovered food items in coolers.
A follow-up inspection was held Sept. 24, 2012 that resulted in seven critical violations. The food inspector reported the same errors as the Aug. 28 visit and an additional violation that said cold food items were stored at improper temperatures. Because five of the violations were corrected on site, the store was able to remain open.
Dean and Deluca could not be reached for comment.
