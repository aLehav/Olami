Daniel Milzman (COL ’16) was charged Friday afternoon with possession of a biological toxin after police found ricin in his room on the sixth floor of McCarthy Hall early Tuesday.
Federal court documents indicate that Milzman, 19, showed a resident assistant a bag of what he claimed was ricin late Monday. According to the affidavit, the RA reported the matter to Counseling and Psychiatric Services, who in turn contacted the Georgetown University Police Department.
Milzman, a 2012 graduate of Walt Whitman High School in Montgomery County, Md., is being held until a detention hearing scheduled for Tuesday. If convicted of possession of a biological toxin, he could face up to 10 years in prison.
Summoned by GUPD, D.C. Fire/EMS conducted a “hazardous materials entry” of Milzman’s McCarthy 6 room on Tuesday morning. Once inside, officers discovered a “small plastic bag containing a powder substance.” Tests at two labs, one run by the D.C. government and the other by the Department of Homeland Security, confirmed the substance was ricin.
In total, Milzman had 123 milligrams of the substance in his possession; within that, the concentration of toxin was 7.7 micrograms per milligram. According to the affidavit, a lethal dose of ricin is approximately three to five micrograms if the substance is inhaled or injected and 20 milligrams per kilogram if ingested.
Adjunct professor William Daddio, who teaches the course “Bioterrorism” at the Georgetown University Medical Center, explained how that amount of ricin could be used.
“With the amount he had under the potency according to the lab tests, in order to potentially kill somebody, they would need to inhale it, which wouldn’t be hard to do, or be injected with it, which, as you would suspect, would be fairly simple,” Daddio said.
In an interview with the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Tuesday, Milzman told investigators that he researched creating ricin on his iPhone, finding a website with instructions on how to produce ricin at home. Court documents say Milzman purchased material to make the substance at Home Depot and the American Plant Company — a scene Daddio also sees as realistic.
“The process of extracting it isn’t overly complicated, so high school chemistry should do the trick for you,” Daddio said.
The affidavit paints a picture of Milzman working alone in his room, wearing goggles and a dust mask, both of which were later seized by the FBI. Milzman produced the the ricin a month ago and stored it in his room in plastic bags. A former hockey player in high school, Milzman reportedly secured the bags with hockey tape.
Although the affidavit contains no information about Milzman’s potential motive, Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15), the RA who brought the ricin to the attention of the university, told The Voice anonymously on Wednesday that Milzman “indicated he intended to use the substance on another student.” Lloyd confirmed to The Hoya he made that statement but declined to comment further because of his potential role in the ongoing investigation.
FBI spokeswoman Jacqueline Maguire did not specify any information regarding a motive. “At this point we don’t have details to provide on that,” Maguire said.
Milzman’s father, Dave Milzman, is research director in the Department of Emergency Medicine at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital. With his father, Milzman has co-authored two articles in the Canadian Journal of Emergency Medicine. His brother, Jesse Milzman (COL ’15), also attends Georgetown.
At Georgetown, Milzman is founder and captain of Georgetown University Quiz Bowl and a member of the Secular Student Alliance. He studies physics and math on a pre-med track.
Joe Laposata (COL ’16), a member of the SSA and Quiz Bowl with Milzman, said he was surprised by the news.
“He seemed like a pretty normal guy,” Laposata said. “The only reason I think he would make ricin was to use it or feel powerful, or both.”
A student who shares friends with Milzman said Milzman had told friends that he was making ricin before the situation became clear to university law enforcement.
“I don’t think he ever would have used it. He simply wanted to prove that he could, and he boasted about it,” said the student, who requested anonymity.
Danny Onorato, a partner at Schertler & Onorato, is representing Milzman. Onorato declined to comment ahead of Tuesday’s hearing.
University spokeswoman Stacy Kerr and GUPD Chief of Police Jay Gruber have not responded for requests for comment.
Hoya Staff Writers Rob DePaolo, TM Gibbons-Neff, Sheena Karkal, Suzanne Monyak, Mallika Sen and Ian Tice contributed reporting.
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Milzman had 123 milligrams of ricin in his possession, enough to kill multiple individuals. 123 milligrams was the total amount of substance produced; within that the concentration of toxin was 7.7 micrograms per milligram. Additionally, the lethal dose of ricin if inhaled is 20 milligrams per kilograms if ingested, not 20 milligrams as stated previously.

In the wake of Tuesday’s revelation that a substance found on the sixth floor of McCarthy Hall had tested positive for the potentially lethal poison ricin, students affected by the investigation have expressed frustration with the university’s inconsistent communication and its dissemination of information during the event and subsequent investigation.
According to university spokesperson and Assistant Vice President for Communications Stacy Kerr, the Georgetown University Police Department responded to reports of a potentially hazardous substance in McCarthy Hall around 4 a.m. Tuesday. GUPD then alerted the Metropolitan Police Department and D.C. Fire/EMS who brought in hazardous materials teams. They were subsequently joined by officers from the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Joint Terrorism Task Force.
According to D.C. Fire/EMS spokesman Timothy Wilson, the squad that responded to the incident worked effectively with the other law enforcement on the scene.
“When we work between local and federal jurisdictions we both have similar protocols in how things are coordinated and carried out. It was a seamless process to work with D.C. police and the FBI in terms of the investigation,” Wilson said.
In the meantime, university administrators and officials convened to discuss the developing situation.
“From the very beginning, we worked with law enforcement and the FBI to ensure that the area was safe for students. We also brought in the D.C. Department of Health to give their consultation to ensure that the area was safe for students,” Kerr said.
At 9:38 a.m., GUPD Chief of Police Jay Gruber sent an email to the university community as well as students’ parents apprising them of the situation, including information that initial field tests had registered negative for hazardous substances.
In order to give law enforcement full access to the area surrounding where the ricin was discovered, residents of the sixth floor of McCarthy were informed at 11 a.m. that the floor would be temporarily closed via an email from the Office of Residential Living.
“Law enforcement had already assured us that we didn’t need to evacuate the building. However, to ensure that investigators had access to all areas, they closed the sixth floor,” Kerr said.
McCarthy 6 resident Margie Fuchs (COL ’16), former deputy editor for The Guide, said she did not receive further updates from the university or ORL throughout the day after initially being told to stay off the floor.
“Throughout the day, all the information I received regarding this incident was either through people posting on Facebook or other D.C. news outlets,” Fuchs said. “And I just find it very concerning that I literally live on this floor and was given no information about it.”
When lab results for the field tests had not yet been returned by late afternoon Tuesday, university officials made the determination to keep the area cordoned off while the investigation remained ongoing. Twenty students living in the area of the floor under investigation were offered temporary housing at the Savoy Hotel, on 2505 Wisconsin Ave. NW, because the Leavey Hotel and Conference Center was full.
Affected students, however, were unable to return to their rooms to retrieve clothing, books or toiletries they might have needed for the night, though each displaced student was given a $20 credit to his or her GOCard for toiletries and food. Daye Shim Lee (SFS ’14) was one of the students temporarily housed off campus for the night.
“They didn’t let us back in for any legitimate necessity, and we were basically told to sleep at the Savoy Hotel; that’s all the way over on Wisconsin Avenue,” Lee said. “The hotel was only provided for the night though, so those of us who didn’t have class until like 3 p.m. didn’t have any access to any kind of shelter until then, and it was just overall really frustrating.”
While students living in the cordoned-off area were informed of the situation via email, the remainder of the sixth floor residents, including residential staff, remained in the dark with respect to updates apart from an email send by Executive Director of Residential Services Patrick Killilee to McCarthy Hall residents at 6:52 p.m.
“Our RA lives on the other side of the hall; she knew less than I and my roommate did. Only the people who were evacuated got any remotely specific emails,” said sixth-floor resident Emily Min (NHS ’16). “Even the rest of the floor knew very little info so I just felt like the flow of information wasn’t effective from the university. I get they were trying to downplay it so as not to cause a panic, but I feel like the order of things they told us was out of order.”
Fuchs was similarly frustrated by the varying levels of information disseminated by university officials to those with rooms in the cordoned-off area and the rest of the sixth floor.
“I think the university acted smartly in that it was a developing situation and they were working within the bounds of what they knew at the time. I just think that more information really would have been helpful for those of us who live on this floor,” Fuchs said.
In follow-up testing performed at a regional laboratory conducted later Tuesday, the contained substance removed from McCarthy tested positive for ricin.
“The results we got on Tuesday were field tests that were performed on site. The substance that was sent to the laboratory tested positive for ricin. All the field tests had come back negative, but it’s protocol that no matter the results of the field tests it all goes to the lab for further testing,” FBI spokeswoman Jacqueline McGuire said.
Ricin, a poison produced from the waste of castor beans, has been experimented with as a chemical warfare agent by the U.S. military as well as international terrorist organizations. According to the Center for Disease Control, exposure to the agent can occur through inhalation, ingestion or skin exposure, and it damages cells by preventing them from producing necessary proteins.
According to McGuire, while the bureau frequently encounters cases involving hazardous materials, this is only the second time in recent history that the D.C. FBI has come upon samples testing positive for ricin.
“We had a case in June 2013 of someone sending ricin, and she sent it to a few places up here, but that’s the last time we’ve had a positive result for ricin in the District. Our Hazardous Materials team responds on a regular basis to a report of suspicious substance. Most often, they’re white powder letters,” McGuire said, referring to a form of scare-letter modeled after the anthrax letters to politicians in the wake of 9/11.
At 3:20 p.m. Wednesday, sixth-floor residents were informed that field tests for the biohazard had come back negative and that they would be able to return to their rooms. The rest of the Georgetown community was informed in a campus-wide email sent by Gruber at 5:20 p.m.
“They were informed that they could return to McCarthy Hall prior to the notification that went to the whole community that the tests were negative,” Kerr said. “We were very mindful of letting students back in as soon as possible.”
This is not the first time in recent years that the university has responded to reports of a hazardous substance on campus. In October 2010, law enforcement officers responded to reports of a drug lab on the ninth floor of Harbin Hall with the intent to produce dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, an illegal, hallucinogenic drug.
Welles Robinson (COL ’14) was a resident of the cluster where the drug lab was found.
“They woke everyone up and the entire building had to go to the Leavey Center,” Robinson said. “They wouldn’t let us back into Harbin for a while, like 10 p.m., I think.”
Unlike the situation in McCarthy, all of Harbin Hall was immediately evacuated as the presence of a DMT lab provided an immediate danger to residents’ health and safety.
While the university has a set of protocols that it follows in such situations, Kerr did not see a connection between the university’s handling of the ricin and DMT situations.
“It was different timing, different circumstances, with different teams in place responding. We feel very comfortable that we took the appropriate steps this week, keeping the safety and health of our students as our top concern,” Kerr wrote in an email.

Mark Adamsson (SFS ’15), an international student remembered as a friend, scholar and athlete, died from lung and heart failure because of medical reasons during spring break in the Dominican Republic. He was 22.
The university held a memorial service for Adamsson on March 18 in Dahlgren Chapel, which was filled to capacity. His parents, Helene Carendi and Trolle Adamsson, as well as his stepfather Jan Carendi, were in attendance.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson notified the Georgetown community of Adamsson’s death in an email March 9.
Adamsson was born in Stockholm, Sweden, on Jan. 30, 1992, and moved to the United States for high school, attending Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. In high school, Adamsson excelled academically and in sports, according to his mother and stepfather.
“Even so in his short life he managed to accomplish so much, and all he embarked on, he fulfilled with honours,” they wrote in a statement. “As to sports, he loved tennis, golf and soccer and he enjoyed the sports in his adopted country like baseball, hockey and basketball.”
At Phillips Academy, Adamsson was the captain of the varsity tennis team, which remained undefeated and won the Class A New England Championship his senior year.
Peter Heidrich, a junior at Middlebury College, played on the varsity tennis team with Adamsson.
“The story of winning New Englands with him was our best moment,” Heidrich wrote in an email. “We both wanted to lead our team to an undefeated season and bring Andover its first tennis championship. … He was a natural leader and instilled a great deal of confidence in the younger players with his dedication to practice and willingness to share advice with the freshmen.”
Throughout his time at Phillips Academy, Adamsson played a large role in student life. He played two varsity sports, tennis and soccer, served as a resident assistant for his dorm and as a member of the student council.
“He was a helping force for new students during orientation and a great member of the social community,” Heidrich wrote. “Our classmates took to our Facebook page immediately after his death, sharing experiences and notes of respect for his character.”
After graduating from Phillips Academy in 2011, Adamsson began his career at Georgetown.
According to his friends Daniel Martin (COL ’15) and Bernhard Wilhelm von Oppersdorff (SFS ’15), who wrote an obituary in the program for Tuesday’s service, Adamsson passionately studied philosophy and foreign affairs.
“He is remembered as one of the most heroically courageous athletes to play for Andover,” the pair wrote. “Mark then brought this spirit to Georgetown, where he was an exemplary student driven by a boundless curiosity and a uniquely resilient work ethic.”
According to his friends and teachers, Adamsson was an extremely intelligent student.
“There was never a simple answer to a question for him,” Matias Beeck (COL ’15) said at the memorial service. “He always thought out more. In our gatherings among friends that last couple nights, many stated that he was a very curious person, and I think that this is the best way to put it. Even though he was one of the most intelligent people I’ve ever met, he wanted to learn and understand more about the world around him.”
Luis Alfonzo (MSB ’15), Adamsson’s roommate of two years, said that he was struck by Adamsson’s wit and intellect the moment they met freshman year.
“Mark was one of the most intelligent and talented people I’ve ever met in my life. … He was really good at everything that he did,” Alfonzo said at the service. “He could talk to you about almost anything, from Latin American politics to NFL players to anything, really. I can say that there are many people here today who have had at least one interesting conversation with Mark that often turned into very hard-to-win debates.”
Peter Janssens, Adamsson’s French professor of two years, said that Adamsson would always sit at the front of the class, actively involved in discussion.
“He was a very strong student in a class that had a lot of strong students. It was a particularly strong class, but even then, he stood out,” Janssens said. “He was very gifted for languages in general, but also very motivated personally to learn. He struck me as very mature, always attentive and curious, but also patient and generous with other students.”
Janssens recalled a composition that Adamsson wrote for French class about the film “Etre et Avoir,” a 2002 documentary about a small, rural school. His composition took the perspective of a character in the movie who was struggling in his life.
“What struck me is that Mark looked for the redeeming qualities in his young person and imagined the way in which he would transform his life and become a successful and happy person,” Janssens said. “It was so moving to me. He was very positive and optimistic person who would discover good and redeeming qualities in himself and also in others. He was very much at peace with himself and somebody who just had a lot of faith in life.”
Adamsson also had many extracurricular interests, according to his mother and stepfather. He loved gourmet food, art and photography. In addition, he cared deeply for his family. According to Alfonzo, Adamsson spent hours on Skype with his family, particularly helping his sister Madeleine with calculus.
“Mark’s sister, Madeleine, was very close to Mark,” Helene Adamsson and Carendi wrote. “He was more than a big brother, he was a master and a friend.”
According to Beeck, Adamsson was wise beyond his years and taught everyone he encountered important lessons.
“Mark touched all of our lives, but it was much more than who he touched. It was how he did it,” Beeck said. “He had this special way of connecting with us that truly influenced how we thought about things. He showed us how meaningful our lives are and would often talk about how they are, to a certain degree, eternal. He once said that the things we do in life have meaning because the effects of our actions will last for eternity.”
At the memorial service, Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., spoke about his discussion with Adamsson’s friends.
“I know that words will be inadequate to sum up such a life, a beautiful young life of your son, of our friend,” O’Brien said. “I spent Sunday evening with many of Mark’s remarkable friends. At one point, I asked them, ‘What do you want me to tell his parents?’ and someone said, ‘We want them to know how much he was loved here.’ He was loved here.”

A student-orchestrated project has attracted attention to issues of gender identity and expression, eliciting mixed reactions to the depiction of prominent figures in drag.
Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) and Giuliana Cucci (COL ’14) — a stage name — conceived the project during spring break while brainstorming marketing promotions for the April 12 GenderFunk, but they soon decided to move the campaign beyond advertising and explore the university’s acceptance of gender expression.
“Georgetown really isn’t a place where you see a lot of unconventional gender expression. You rarely see a lot of variation in very strict gender roles,” Lloyd said. “We so narrowly define them at Georgetown. Certainly, there’s no room for someone who wants to play around with gender and expression.”
Lloyd suggested advertising the drag ball with an image of John Carroll holding a wig; the next day, Cucci shared an image she designed of University President John J. DeGioia in a wig and makeup.
“I loved it. I though it was funny, well done. I wanted to show it to everyone. [Cucci] started to express a lot of fear about how the university would respond,” Lloyd said.
Cucci, who identifies as trans* and genderqueer, explained that her fear stemmed from worry that the campaign would elicit backlash against the LGBTQ community.
“While Georgetown has made a lot of progress in the last five years, many people think that LGBT+ folks should be content with how far we’ve come and be done with it. I was worried that the administration [and] the general population would use it as an excuse to redemonize queer groups on campus or even specific figures,” she wrote in an email. However, she felt the campaign, entitled “Utraque Unum: Both Into One,” provided a visual representation of pressing issues, such as patriarchy, sexism and cissexism.
The flyers, originally posted in the Leavey Center and Red Square, feature DeGioia, Carroll, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., and Pope Francis in wigs and makeup, while LGBTQ Resource Center Director Shiva Subbaraman sports a moustache.
“One of my main inspirations for this project was the pop image of Putin in response to Russia’s anti-LGBT laws. I think pop art made a lot of sense for this project because Warhol used it to comment on the everyday, normalized images around us. I used that normalizing style to do something that, for Georgetown, is very queer,” Cucci wrote.
Olson, O’Brien and Subbaraman all declined to comment for this article, while DeGioia could not be reached for comment through the Office of Communications. 
Lloyd, the president of GU Pride, acted independently of the organization, as the board, while agreeing with the intent of the campaign, was not wholly comfortable with association, over fears of reprisal in the form of revocation of access to benefits. He, however, said that feedback has tended toward the positive.
“A lot of people have reached to me to say that it was very important to them, that it was funny, that it was great that people were using art for a social end,” he said. “This includes some administrators that have reached out to me privately to tell me how much they support the project.”
However, he expressed dismay with anonymous negative comments on a post on campus blog “Vox Populi,” accusing Lloyd and Cucci of defacement and pushing an agenda too far.
“Why is this any different from a political cartoon? From Photoshopping them in a different location? When a woman puts on makeup, is it defacement? No. Why is it different with a man?” Lloyd said. “There’s something about unconventional gender expression that reaches into the lizard part of our brain and makes us react violently.”
The commenter’s identification as ally of the LGBTQ community also drew Lloyd’s ire.
“You can’t be an ally and then disagree with the actions of the advocates of the community you want to work with,” he said.
The installation in Red Square was removed within 24 hours of its posting. In response, Lloyd added more flyers Thursday night, including new images of men’s basketball Head Coach John Thompson III, Center for Student Engagement Director Erika Cohen Derr and Provost Robert Groves.
“For those who say that there is no anti-gay bias, that the issues are just with the campus’s free speech policy, I would argue that more conservative voices on campus don’t value free expression,” Lloyd said. “If they did, they wouldn’t tear down condom envelopes from people’s doors, which is their space of free expression, or tear down our gender images in Red Square.”
He plans on posting more images, each time one is taken down, but anticipates an end to the campaign after GenderFunk, citing budgetary constraints.
Among the general campus community, the campaign has met with varying considerations.
“I don’t support it because I feel like there’s better ways to spark this discussion, and if that’s their sole purpose in doing that, then they don’t need to deface administrators and other people who work at the school,” Sarah Devermann (SFS ’17) said.
However, Ellen Rote (COL ’17) believed that the campaign provided an apt addition to campus discourse.
“I don’t think it’s inappropriate. I feel like there’d be no reason for someone to say that that was a crazy thing to do in the first place. I don’t see anything particularly wrong with it. I guess since it is our president, you have to be kind of cautious with what you’re doing, but I don’t think it’s inappropriate at all,” Rote said. Both students felt that the posters should not have been taken down.
In the end, Lloyd hopes to channel any outrage into thought-provoking discussion.
“The point of the campaign is to raise anger and then have you question the reasons behind it,” he said. “The point of the campaign was to start a discussion about gender, trying to raise the bar by expression.”

“When a woman puts on makeup, is it defacement? No. Why is it different with a man?” 
It’s not different, but the people putting on the makeup choose to put on the makeup. We are a community and that needs to be respected. If the administrators agreed that they would not mind their photos being used, then by all means, but they did not give consent for their images to be used, and thus that is where the issue lies, not with the campaign itself. 
Those represented are not just far off figureheads of Georgetown who leave students to go about their business while they carry out their own duties, they are active members of our community and can be approached on campus very easily. What if a random student’s photo was used without permission? Would that be acceptable? I would hope the student body would not be okay with such an action. Why is it any different if its an admin?

TaL says 
March 22, 2014 at 9:14 am
The answer to this question is simple. 
Georgetown Administrators are public figures who images have been altered in dozens of publications on and off campus, and there has never been a single response from them or the student body. 
Administrators have been portrayed as dinosaurs, stick figures, whatever. without a single batted eyelash. This is entirely selective outrage, that comes from our sometimes subconscious lack of comfort over gender-non conformity. Objectively, why is a man wearing makeup or being portrayed as doing so any more offensive than photoshopping him next to the Leaning Tower of Pisa or with a dead president? They are featured in political cartoons, other photoshops etc. 
These are meant to make statements that are positive and aimed about our perceptions of gender generally, not about the gender identity or frankly anything about the individuals portrayed in the images. The only reason why they are featured and edited is because they are public campus figures, and those involved in crafting policy about gender
Not only is there no mal-intent, but also I would argue that since most of those involved have made statements either hostile to unconventional gender expression (and free speech) or taken or enforced policies that are similarly antiquated, to say that its THESE images that are doing the offending really ignores the problem, which is how we all are hung up on silly elements of gender expression
At its core, these images are artistic, silly, and can only offend those who find unconventional gender expression offensive or light hearted alterations of public figures offensive, neither of which I agree is justification not to do it

As early voting began March 17 for the April 1 Democratic mayoral primary election, two recent developments are making waves in Mayor Vincent Gray’s re-election campaign with a resurgence of new criticism.
Businessman Jeffrey Thompson, the focus of the federal investigation into Gray’s 2010 campaign for mayor, pled guilty March 12 to conspiracy to violate Washington, D.C. and federal campaign finance laws.
Thompson admitted to accepting illegal campaign contributions of over $650,000. According to court documents, prosecutors believe that Gray knew of these campaign contributions, even personally asking for such funds. The prosecutors believe that prior to the 2010 election, Gray gave Thompson a $425,000 budget and promised to keep the donations secret, giving Thompson the code name “Uncle Earl.”
U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr., who is leading the Thompson investigation, said the guilty plea allows prosecutors a new glimpse into the corruption that has historically plagued D.C. politics.
“Today’s guilty plea pulls back the curtain on years of widespread corruption,” Machen said. “With Mr. Thompson’s cooperation, we have the opportunity to hold many wrongdoers accountable and to usher in a new era of honesty, integrity and transparency in D.C. politics.”
Nevertheless, Gray has continued to assert his innocence. Although Gray admitted to meeting with Thompson and using a code name, he denied allegations that he knew of any illegal activity related to his campaign.
“I maintain these are lies,” Gray said in an interview with NBC4. “These are absolute lies.”
According to Gray, he believed Thompson had wanted to avoid a conflict with then-Mayor Adrian Fenty, who held power over many of Thompson’s city contracts.
“I thought it was because of him not wanting to be seen as legitimately raising money for my campaign out of fear of retribution,” Gray said in an interview with NBC4. “So that’s true.”
Furthermore, Gray said that he would remain in his mayoral post should federal charges be pressed against him.
“I’m not going to walk away from this situation,” Gray said in a morning television interview on ABC7.
Two days after Thompson’s guilty plea, D.C. Councilmember David Catania (I-At Large) — a sharp critic of the mayor — officially announced his mayoral bid. As an independent, Catania would face off against the Democratic nominee during the general election in November.
If successful, Catania, a councilmember since 1997 and a former Republican who left the party in 2004, could be both the District’s first white mayor and first openly gay mayor.
Following his announcement, Catania emphasized his vision for the future of the city, specifically addressing Gray’s scandal.
“This whole drama that we’ve had — this ‘Jeff Thompson-Vince Gray drama’ — the time has come for this to end,” Catania told reporters outside the elections office. “I’m talking about my vision for the city, which doesn’t include serving as a human lie detector for Jeff Thompson or Vince Gray.”
In the days following Thompson’s guilty plea, Gray’s other mayoral challengers also spoke out against the Gray administration.
“Today is a tragic day for D.C. politics and our city,” Councilmember Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4) said in a statement. “The citizens of our great city are witnesses to a flagrant betrayal of the public trust.”
“There is no question [Gray] was elected with a corrupt campaign,” Ward 6 Councilmember Tommy Wells said in a debate March 13 that included Bowser and fellow Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2).
Evans, who has been reluctant to criticize the mayor throughout the campaign, echoed Bowser and Wells’ sentiments during Thursday’s ABC7 debate, but added that any final conclusions would need further evidence.
“The mayor is under this cloud,” Evans said. “[But] I think the mayor has the right to his day.”
Wells and Evans hope to earn a final boost prior to the April 1 election, but recent polls have them behind Bowser, with Gray still leading. Earlier this week, Wells picked up the coveted endorsements of the unions that represent the D.C. Fire and Police Departments.
Other candidates, including former State Department official Reta Jo Lewis and restaurateur Andy Shallal, are continuing their campaign efforts as early voting in the District begins.
“A vote for Reta Jo Lewis is a vote for ‘A City That Works For Everyone.’ Early voting has started. Reta Lewis is No. 3 on the ballot,” Lewis’ campaign posted on Facebook on Tuesday, along with photos of Lewis braving the cold outside the Judiciary Square Metro stop.
Dwight Kirk, Shallal’s campaign manager, said that Shallal is continuing to gain support in the wake of the Thompson allegations.
“Voters are taking a second look at all of the candidates in the wake of the Jeff Thompson guilty plea,” Kirk said. “Andy is winning over voters at every forum, every meeting, every interview with his strong voice for social justice and accountability.”
The federal investigation into the 2010 campaign remains ongoing. Gray’s attorney, Robert Bennett, told WUSA9 on Tuesday that he expects the U.S. attorney to seek an indictment against the mayor, but the mayor will fight the charges.
[…] March 10, Thompson pled guilty to the conspiracy in federal court, and prosecutors like U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen, who is […]

Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan advised third-year law students to approach their budding careers holistically when she spoke at the Georgetown University Law Center on Monday afternoon as part of the inaugural Dean’s Lecture to the Graduating Class.
Kagan described herself as a voracious reader who grew up aspiring to become a writer. Although her father was an attorney, Kagan never considered becoming a lawyer until after she graduated from Princeton University and discovered her passion at Harvard Law School.
“From the very first day, I fell in love with it,” Kagan said. “I liked the puzzle aspects of law … but I also liked the fact that it wasn’t purely a puzzle and purely abstract, but that there were ways people could use the law to actually make a difference in the world.”
Responding to a question from Law Center Dean William Treanor, Kagan instructed graduating law students about how to launch their careers.
“Don’t think about just your first job,” Kagan said. “Try to be more holistic in your thinking about the kinds of experiences you want to have and the kind of work you want to do during the course of your career.”
Kagan spoke highly of her experiences as a clerk for Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Abner Mikva and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. After clerking, Kagan went on to teach at the University of Chicago.
Kagan specifically emphasized the importance of collaborating with others in all careers. She identified her time as Dean of Harvard Law School as being a period when teamwork was crucial.
“Part of what makes a good dean is listening to people and getting them to focus on the institution as a whole,” Kagan said.
Kagan also focused on the importance of flexibility and the greater good.
“The ability to recognize that life is long and there are lots of different opportunities that are going to present themselves to you gives you a sort of freedom to think about your career,” Kagan said. “The lawyers that are happy find some way to accomplish something for people outside themselves and what that is is going to vary enormously,”
Kagan’s advice resonated well with Georgetown Law students who attended the event. Lorin Dale-Pierce (LAW ’14), who heard Justice Sonia Sotomayor speak in 2012, expressed her gratitude for having the opportunity to hear from both Justices.
“The advice was realistic. Justice Kagan was very down-to-earth and it was nice to hear a different perspective as a third-year student,” Dale-Pierce said. “It re-enforced that I don’t have to worry about every single thing in my career.”

Underclassmen looking to take “International Relations” with professor Keir Lieber this semester may have been confused after searching his last name on MyAccess and finding mainly courses above the 300 level.
That’s because “Lieber” returns search results for both Keir and his father, Robert Lieber, who is also a professor at Georgetown.
The son, professor Keir Lieber, joined Georgetown as a faculty member in the School of Foreign Service’s security studies program in 2009. His father, professor Robert Lieber, has served as a professor in the department of government since 1982. They both have secondary appointments in each other’s respective departments.
However, Robert Lieber said that the two do not interact with each other on a daily basis, and the Liebers have to make time to see one another outside of monthly departmental meetings by getting together for coffee or lunch.
“Our offices are in different places. He’s over in the Mortara Center and I’m a 10-minute walk away in the ICC. … The fact that we each have a different base, different budgets [and] are not involved in anything having to do with supervising each other’s work is important,” Robert Lieber said.
Although Keir Lieber never set out to follow in his father’s footsteps, his father’s influence on his career is unmistakable. Through Robert Lieber’s travels on sabbatical as a professor at the University of California at Davis, Keir Lieber was exposed to many foreign countries growing up.
“My father’s influence on my path was primarily indirect — by way of example. I was aware of what he did for a living; he seemed to love his job. I came to share his interest in history, international politics and U.S. foreign policy, and, of course, I gained plenty of useful experience arguing with him at the dinner table,” Keir Lieber said.
The Liebers have avoided perceived nepotism or conflation of their opinions and beliefs.
“It helps that I spent the first eight years as a professor elsewhere — at the University of Notre Dame … [as it] has helped head off any serious perceptions of improper influence,” Keir Lieber said.
Robert Lieber actively avoided anything involving Keir Lieber’s appointment to the position.
“I stayed a thousand miles away from it,” he said. “I didn’t go to any of the job talks, and I studiously avoided talking to any of my colleagues about him. … Whether he got the position or not was dependent entirely on what he demonstrated.”
In fact, Robert Lieber said that when his son selected an undergraduate institution, he specifically chose not to enroll at Georgetown in the SFS, as they both believed that the school was too small for the two of them. Both professors completed their undergraduate education at the University of Wisconsin.
However, since joining the same institution, both Liebers have only seen advantages to working in the same environment.
“There are great benefits to being at the same university as my father. … I can always go to him with questions about past university policies and practices, [and] he is also always willing to review and comment on an article or proposal draft, as I do for him,” Keir Lieber said.
When reviewing one of his son’s articles, Robert Lieber recalled his reaction to the work from a purely professional standpoint.
“It was a eureka moment. … I was stunned by the importance of it, by the quality of it, and it made me think of the best work in the field,” Robert Lieber said.
Luckily though, the two have yet to have conflict while working together at Georgetown.
“If anything, I’d look forward to a future clash of views with my father; he is a master of department politics, and I’d relish the opportunity to play Luke Skywalker to his Darth Vader.  But so far we’ve tended to see eye to eye on most substantive matters,” Keir Lieber said.
However, his father was clear to point out that they each have their own outlooks that are not always the same as the other’s stance.
“We don’t necessarily agree on every issue. We agree on plenty of things but we disagree on some policy questions. … The disagreements are high level, and what you would want among colleagues,” Robert Lieber said.
Colleagues of the pair noticed their ability to work cohesively as a team.
“The Liebers are the power forwards of the Georgetown faculty: They are excellent teachers who evince a deep commitment to this university and its students. As scholars, they both seek out the most important questions and are unafraid to offer controversial and unpopular answers if they feel that is what the evidence demands,” professor Daniel Byman wrote in an email.
According to professor David Edelstein, who attended graduate school with Keir Lieber at the University of Chicago, and considers Robert Lieber a mentor, the duo is well-appreciated on campus.
“Having a father and his son in the same department at the same university is unusual in academia, but Georgetown is fortunate to have the Liebers. … While they both have their own strong identities and personalities, the apple did not fall far from the tree in some important ways. They are both creative scholars, dedicated teachers and trustworthy colleagues,” Edelstein wrote in an email.
The close father-son relationship has only been strengthened both as academics and as relatives by working together at Georgetown.
“My father has taught me a lot — again, mainly by his own example.  … Whether in the classroom or in print … he is a model academic citizen,” Keir Lieber said.  “I admire and try to emulate his deep commitment to the academic enterprise and Georgetown University. … Most importantly, I just feel lucky to see my father doing what he does best and in his prime.”

Steve Ells, the founder and CEO of Chipotle Mexican Grill, highlighted Tuesday evening in Lohrfink Auditorium the importance of changing the way people think about and eat fast food.
Throughout the event, sponsored by the McDonough School of Business and the Lecture Fund, Ells outlined the history of Chipotle, which he founded in 1993 after attending the Culinary Institute of America and working at Stars restaurant in San Francisco. While living in San Francisco, Ells frequented a taqueria where big burritos were served in tinfoil wrappers.
Originally, Ells desired to own a restaurant to make a quick profit. Today, Chipotle has over 1,500 locations in over 43 states, and every week four new Chipotle restaurants open. Ells did not anticipate the immense success of his spontaneous decision.
“I’m not a good planner. I didn’t have this grand vision for doing all these things in a very linear progression,” Ells said. “One thing that is a commonality in all of these decisions is that they felt like the right decisions.”
Chipotle made its name through its mission, which aims to change the way customers think about and eat fast food. Ells founded the restaurant with the hopes of providing a fast food service with fresh ingredients from sustainable sources and preparing the food in a natural, transparent way.
“Fast is not the problem with fast-food, it’s the food. It’s how the food is raised, how the food is processed, how it’s cooked, or not cooked, but re-thermalized,” Ells said.
Ells’ passion for selling a quality product led him to visit farms around the country, which inspired him to provide his customers with only the best tasting meat and best treated animals.
“The brutality in this confinement hog operation was really transformative for me. It was very, very uncomfortable, and I knew at that moment that I didn’t want my success or Chipotle’s success to be based on the kind of exploitation that I saw,” Ells said.
The emphasis on no exploitation of animals and all around transparency raised several questions about other ingredients on the Chipotle menu. Currently the company plans for all food to be free of genetically modified ingredients by the end of the year.
“The food with integrity journey is never going to be over. … [It is important] to people who are concerned with the environment and animal welfare, but also just concerned with the taste of their food and to have good taste and a fun restaurant experience without the kind of exploitation that goes on with a lot of fast-food places,” Ells said.
While Ells opened two new restaurants, ShopHouse, with four locations, and Pizzeria Locale, with two locations, his approach to dining throughout all remains similar.
However, the types of cuisine the new restaurants offer differ from Chipotle’s. ShopHouse borrows flavors from traditional cuisine in Southeast Asian countries, while Pizzeria Locale is not your typical pizza place.
Ells enthusiastically described Pizzeria Locale’s cooking style.
“The first thing you see is this dough room with this big marble slab. We’re mixing flour and water and starter and salt–the four ingredients that should be in pizza dough,” Ells said. “[There are] beautiful California tomatoes and fresh mozzarella. … It then goes into a really special high temperature oven and two minutes later the pizza comes out.”
After Ells’ lecture, the floor opened to a question and answer session. One student asked Ells about President Barack Obama’s current push for an increase in minimum wage and the effect it would have on Chipotle employees.
“If minimum wage were raised, it would not negatively affect us perhaps like it would affect other people,” Ells said. “I think about opportunity more than minimum wage. I would rather give people an opportunity to avail themselves of leadership positions and positions that are a long-term career, and I think by offering this kind of thing you are attracting a higher caliber of person who is not going to stand for a minimum wage.”
Many students who attended the event felt pleasantly surprised that Chipotle emphasizes food with integrity. Many students enjoyed Ells lecture, as well as the free gift cards for one burrito and one ShopHouse bowl each attendee received. Some students even asked for Ells’ autograph, with Nick Oki (COL ’14) receiving a signature on his burrito.
“I didn’t know anything about the business or history of Chipotle before I went tonight, but the way he spoke about changing the reality of fast food culture really inspired me,” Jessika Brenin (COL ’17) said. “The business model of Chipotle is such a smart and effective way to both promote healthy, local food and motivate a thriving workplace environment.”
Chipotle’s focus on transparency with customers also resonated with students.
“I think it’s important to have transparency because we do live in a society where most of the food we get we don’t know where it comes from and where it’s made. … We get to see it made in front of us at Chipotle and it’s a step in the right direction to eating right,” Jake Maxmin (COL ’17) said.

North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen accepted the 2014 Hillary Rodham Clinton Award for Advancing Women in Peace and Security in the Lohrfink Auditorium on Wednesday morning after he was unable to attend the initial eremony on Feb . 25
Hillary Clinton, former secretary of state and honorary founder of the Georgetown Institute of Women, Peace and Security, held the first ceremony Feb. 25, where British Foreign Secretary William Hague and Congolese Hospital Director Denis Mukwege received their awards.
After accepting the award from University President John J. DeGioia on Wednesday, Rasmussen delivered remarks about the advancement of women worldwide and NATO’s reaction to the current antagonism between Russia and Ukraine.
“If women do not play an active part in making peace and keeping peace, then the needs and interests of half of the world’s population are not taken into account,” Rasmussen said. “It is vital that we continue to develop our understanding of how women are affected by conflict and how they can be a prominent part of the resolution, not sometimes but every time.”
Ambassador Melanne Verveer, executive director of the Institute for Women, Peace and Security and the first U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women’s Issues, outlined Rasmussen’s accomplishments in her opening remarks. Rasmussen was honored for his leadership in creating a NATO action plan on women, peace and security and for his commitment to the implementation of this plan.
“It is for his exemplary leadership at NATO in advancing women, peace and security that we honor him today,” Verveer said.
In 2012, Rasmussen appointed Norwegian diplomat Mari Skåre as the first special representative for Women, Peace and Security.
“He has boldly led NATO’s efforts to integrate women, peace and security into the alliance’s operation. … He understands that women are agents of change and drivers of progress, not just victims and survivors,” Clinton said of Rasmussen at the award ceremony last month.
In his remarks, Rasmussen discussed the growing influence of women in Afghanistan in roles related to peace and security.
“We have helped Afghan women and girls to exercise their rights and, increasingly, also to shape the future of their country,” Rasmussen said.
He outlined the role of Afghan women in providing lines of communications to communities that are not open to male soldiers, in consulting with commanders about specific health and education needs of women and girls and in providing a female perspective in security decisions. Additionally, Afghan women are becoming increasing active in the Afghan military and police forces.
“Over 2,000 women are now part of the security forces. That may not sound like many, but for a country like Afghanistan, it is a visible change for the better,” Rasmussen said.
Afghan Ambassador to the United States Eklil Ahmad Hakimi was in attendance.
Rasmussen said that women’s input in security decisions is vital due to the way that conflict affects women.
“Armed conflict often hits women and children harder than men. They lose access to basic services, to education and economic opportunities and increasingly, they are subjected to sexual violence,” Rasmussen said. “The harsh reality is that, in many conflict areas today, it is more dangerous to be a woman than a soldier.”
Although Rasmussen’s remarks focused primarily on the advancement of women around the world and the growing role of females in NATO, he briefly discussed the events currently unfolding between Russia and Ukraine, which he expounded on at the Brookings Institution later that day.
Rasmussen condemned the Russian annexation of Crimea, stating that Russia’s disruption of European security was inappropriate.
“Recent events in Ukraine have shown that we cannot take that security and stability for granted and that we need to stand up for our values. We have seen Russia rip up the international rulebook, trying to redraw the map of Europe and creating in just a few weeks the most serious security crisis since the end of the Cold War,” Rasmussen said. “This sort of behavior goes against international norms and it simply has no place in the 21st century.”

With the recent spate of network phishing attacks, where hackers have attempted to gain information, the university has instituted a mandatory biannual password change for students, faculty and staff during both the fall and spring semesters.
University Information Services sent out the first batch of emails to students who have not changed their password in the last six months — students who changed their password within the last month are exempted — but found that 1,300 have failed to change their passwords. This figure represents about half the students notified.
If students fail to change their passwords by the date specified in their targeted email, they will be locked out of the system and be required to call the service center in order to go through the password change process and regain access to the network. UIS has already postponed their additional deadline, because of spring break.
“We’re looking at about 31,000 student IDs, and if you take that 50 percent number, that’s a lot of people. We don’t want that many people getting cut off. We don’t even want half that many people getting cut off,” Associate University Information Security Officer Judith House said. “We’ve worked the dates around so that no one will be cut off during pre-registration and no one will be cut off during exams, but in that window in between, everybody is either going to have to comply or be cut off.”
In order to ward against attacks, Georgetown uses a defense and depth system, which uses layers of defense to ward off hackers. The university gets around 2.4 million attacks a month on the system. Normally attacks come in the form of false log-ins or malware links that network users click on, allowing a false network to gain their information.
“In a very real sense, the human is the weak link. … If you have a weak password that’s easy for them to guess, if you accidentally click on a link that has malware attached to it, that kind of thing, is a door into the institution,” House said.
Recently, other schools, including University of Maryland, Indiana University, Johns Hopkins University and the University of North Dakota, suffered data breaches. University of Maryland’s system especially suffered, as attackers were able to gain personal information of around 300,000 students, including social security numbers.
For some students, the emails about phishing attacks have proven confusing, as they are unsure how exactly to change their passwords and what to look out for.
“I also think that the university doesn’t really do a good job differentiating what’s real and what’s not because they’ll say, ‘Did you get this email? That was fake, don’t do it,’ and I never really know which one is which,” Claudia Huang (COL ’17) said.
Huang noted that she had not changed her password, and was not aware that students are required to do so and that students would benefit from a Blackboard alert directing a password change.
Thu Dao (NHS ’17), who also had not changed her password, did not feel particularly concerned about the phishing attacks.
“I think I should be, but because I haven’t been personally affected by it, I don’t think I’m that concerned,” Dao said.
In order to cause more concern, some students believe the university should more directly and clearly communicate with students about the status of attacks.
“I think they could make it more clear in how they explain what the risks are to students and just the way that students can protect themselves,” Evan Chernack (SFS ’17) said. “If that’s something Georgetown wants to do, it needs to be accompanied by them raising a lot of awareness.”

Under the vision of A.J. Serlemitsos (COL ’17), the new organization Georgetown Talks aims to encourage students to talk about their personal experience at Georgetown and foster conversations on campus about diversity and students’ personal issues.
The organization’s first event will be a talk given by Serlemitsos on Wednesday about his experience growing up in Africa as white, followed by a brief discussion and forum.
Serlemitsos came up with the idea for Georgetown Talks based on a similar concept from his Connecticut boarding school, Choate Rosemary Hall.
“At Choate, it was really a TED Talks expansion, just giving people a chance to speak to the student body about an issue they felt passionate about, whether it be an issue worldwide, or even just a personal issue they were dealing with, like where they’re from and how it made them unique,” Serlemitsos said.
Another goal of Georgetown Talks is to create more student interaction that enriches the Georgetown student experience.
“We’re just trying to foster a greater sense of community awareness. We need people sharing their stories, their upbringings, their personal experiences — things that they’re passionate about — and engaging with one another, and Georgetown Talks will be a great way they can do that,” Jack Maher (COL ’17), the other Georgetown Talks team member, said.
Though the project was initially conceived in October as an evolution of GUSA’s Freshman Outreach Committee, the organization has yet to see a talk. Serlemitsos attributes the wait to administrative hurdles.
“[The administration] has a lot of rules about what it means to be an official group. They have a lot of limitations on what you can do if you’re not an official group,” he said.
With an abundance of speakers on campus, Maher still stressed the necessity of the organization, claiming that other groups did not focus on giving students a voice.
“Having some of the great minds the Lecture Fund brings in is nice, but ultimately, they’re talking about things on a global scale that might not be as pertinent to Georgetown, and so what we’re trying to do through Georgetown Talks is get something that’s more of a personal and intimate experience,” Maher said.
Serlemitsos pointed out free speech and diversity as major issues he hopes to see brought up in future talks. These issues served as prominent topics of discussion in this year’s new “What’s a Hoya?” program.
Megan Murday (SFS ’15) — one of the coordinators of “What’s a Hoya?” — was excited for the new organization.
“It sounds like a very interesting and worthwhile program. For the final session of ‘What’s a Hoya?’ we invited students to come and give a talk related to an aspect of diversity in their own lives and then lead a miniature discussion with the freshmen,” Murday said. “Many freshman participants remarked that it was their favorite session, so I hope there is continued enthusiasm for the new program.”
However, Murday addressed one of the major problems of the organization, admitting to having never heard of Georgetown Talks before. Serlemitsos agreed there had been some trouble in reaching out to people to build a strong community.
“It’s tough marketing to the people we don’t know that want Georgetown Talks to succeed but don’t know about it yet. We’re going to do some tabling over the next few days.”
The idea of continued conversations on topics such as diversity sparks student interest.
“On the surface level, I think it’s a very interesting idea. I have really enjoyed understanding that everyone on Georgetown has taken very different paths to the Hilltop,” Mike Gee (SFS ’15) said. “It matters how they fill the venue and that they make sure it’s a discussion and not just a talk. It’s important for them to build a community so people are comfortable expressing themselves and their true opinions.”
Other students, like Dylan Orshefsky (COL ’17), were less intrigued by the premise of the talks.
“Diversity is not something that I feel, to me, is something that needs to have a discussion about. I personally am just not that interested in it. But if the talks were something more along the lines of science, technology, culture, linguistics — I’d absolutely be interested in it,” Orshefsky said.

With the spring return of the Georgetown University Farmers Market to Copley Lawn, students will notice new vendors as well as the absence of Indigo, the popular Indian food stand, on Wednesdays.
This year’s new vendors include Hilltoss — the new Students of Georgetown Inc. salad location — Lulu’s Ice Cream, Rita’s Crepes and a new pickle vendor called Fresh Crunch. This introduction of different food stands is an attempt to vary the vendors based on the change of season while continuing to cater to student preferences.
“We have our vendors try to rotate in and out just to keep consistency but also to get a diverse variety of offerings throughout the market season,” Farmers Market Director Lexi Cotcamp (MSB ’15) said.
Director of Hilltoss Dana Mitchell (MSB ’15) was pleased with the student-run stand’s first day at the farmers market.
While Hilltoss is new to the scene, Indigo — a student favorite — will not return to the farmers market.
“I believe Indigo won’t be back this season just because they recently opened a new restaurant near Union Station and so they are actually focusing on that this semester,” Cotcamp said.
Cotcamp partly attributed the new food selections to vendor availability.
“There is no specific reason as to why a certain vendor would be included over another other than the fact that certain factors would prevent a vendor from being able to come, such as opening a restaurant, or growing or time constraints,” Cotcamp said.
The products that are sold at the farmers market, especially in the produce section, vary according to the weather. Peach season occurs toward the beginning of the academic year, while apples are most abundant during the fall and winter vegetables are plentiful during this time of year.
“Our product offerings tend to be very much dedicated to the different seasons,” Cotcamp said. “Mother Nature really tends to figure out how our product offerings will go, depending on if there is a late freeze or an early start to spring.”
The weather is especially impactful on the weekly market because of its focus on local products. All produce comes from the D.C. area, a standard which is enforced by Georgetown Farmers Market leadership.
“In order to actually come to the market, vendors must sign a contract, which essentially binds them to only bring to the market produce that is sourced locally, which is defined as being within I believe [a] 200-mile … radius,” Cotcamp said.
Besides the climate’s effect on product offerings, weather also affects whether the market can function at all. However, despite recent storms, Cotcamp said that weather wouldn’t prevent the stands from opening for business.
“Of course, if there is any sort of emergency condition where the university is closed, then we would have to reconsider, but for the most part, we tend to operate rain or shine,” Cotcamp said.
Because the market’s opening day was plagued with wind, rain and mud, some vendors were concerned with weather issues.
“Weather is 50 percent of our sales, one way or another. If it’s bad weather, it’s going to be less than half [of our normal sales],” Fresh Crunch founder Matt Bressan said.
As students quickly moved from stand to stand to avoid the rain, some said that the bad weather would limit their time at the market. However, they said they would continue coming in future weeks.
“I probably won’t stay around as long if the weather continues, but as long as I have an umbrella, I’m good and I’ll show up,” Angela Ribaudo (SFS ’17) said.
The products themselves continue to draw Erika Bullock (COL ’17) despite weather concerns.
“[The weather] is a little bit of an impediment, but I just love the fresh produce so much that it doesn’t affect me personally too much,” Bullock said.
Even with weather concerns, vendors are happy to return to campus.
“I love this market. The students and the faculty and the staff love our stuff. We’re really happy to be back,” said Chris Girardot, who is in charge of running the Upper Crust Bakery stand.

The Georgetown University Law Center announced the establishment of the Hillary Clinton Fellowship on Feb. 25. The foundation will provide funding for graduates of the Law Center to work in collaboration with the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security for a year.
The fellowship, sourced from a $1 million gift from alumni Rep. John Delaney of Maryland (LAW ’88) and April McClain-Delaney (LAW ’89), entitles selected graduates to conduct rigorous research, produce reports and publications, track developments in the field and become in-house experts on critical, timely issues related to international law, human rights, women, peace and security.
The program, which is open to recent graduates of Master’s level programs, provides a one-year, full-time and fully-funded opportunity for three selected annual fellows to focus on legal research and analysis. GU Law Center, The Clinton School of Public Service at the University of Arkansas and Georgetown University will each recruit one graduate fellow for the newly established program which will begin summer 2014.
“The fellows are named in honor of Secretary Clinton, who serves as the Institute’s Honorary Founding Chair, because the Institute’s creation was in large part inspired by her leadership and commitment to women, peace and security,” Mayesha Alam, GIWPS assistant director said. “This new cadre of fellows represent the next generation of informed leaders, the best and brightest from Georgetown and beyond, and the fellowship program is a wonderful way to commemorate Secretary Clinton.”
In addition to the Hillary Clinton Fellowship, the donation will also fund the Delaney Fellowship program, a program that will offer 25 graduates one-year fellowships to work in the public interest field over the course of the next five years, as well as the Delaney Scholars summer program, a program that will teach students about what is entailed in a career in public interest by offering a course and giving students experience in the field with nonprofit or government agencies.
Dean of Georgetown University Law Center William Treanor believes that the fellowship will provide a valuable opportunity for graduates to attain important experience prior to the beginning of their professional careers.
“This will be a great opportunity for our graduates to do public service in international law and women’s rights,” Treanor said. “The research they will do and the reports they will create will then be made public. This is very exciting for us since when people are interested in international law and human rights, it is often requisite that people have experience in it from before, which makes it hard to get it as a first job.”
Delaney stressed the importance of women’s rights advocacy to him and his wife.
“April and I are just being supporters, and we believe getting a better understanding of the legal framework of women’s rights is incredibly important,” he said.
April McClain-Delaney serves as the Washington D.C. director for Common Sense Media Inc., an international research center that focuses on problems surrounding young girls in the media and aims to give support to women in the developing world.
“She’s really a professional, a full-time advocate for rights of women and young girls in really difficult situations,” Delaney said of his wife.
With Secretary Clinton in attendance, the Hillary Clinton Fellowship was officially announced Feb. 25 at a ceremony held in Gaston Hall. Scheduled to begin this summer, the fellowship anticipates starting with three fellows but will consider increasing the number in the future.

Jeffrey Selingo, professor of practice at Arizona State University and senior adviser to University President John J. DeGioia, discussed the future of leadership in higher education at a public forum at Georgetown’s downtown campus Tuesday. The forum, called “Leadership for the Innovative University,” was part of Georgetown’s “Designing the Future(s) of the University Initiative.”
Selingo, an expert in higher education and author of “College (Un)Bound: The Future of Higher Education and What It Means for Students,” assembled and moderated the panel with the goal of gathering a unique diversity of perspectives on how leadership training in higher education can be improved.
“This particular panel includes sitting presidents, but it also includes experts in leadership and innovation from industry and the military. The goal of this panel was to move beyond academic silos and bring together leaders accustomed to dealing with disruptive changes,” Interim Dean of Continuing Studies Walter Rankin wrote in an email.
DeGioia, Arizona State President Michael Crow, President of Northeastern University Joseph Aoun, retired Army Lt. Gen. Benjamin Freakley, author and co-founder of Rotman DesignWorks at the University of Toronto Heather Fraser, Chancellor of the University System of Maryland William “Brit” Kirwan and Acting Deputy Undersecretary in the U.S. Department of Education Jamienne Studley were present as panelists.
“We wanted a diversity of opinions pulled from inside and outside of higher ed,” Selingo said.
The event announced the partnership between Georgetown and Arizona State to develop a program that will help to train people within the higher education system to hold university leadership positions.
Through this partnership, which will be launched in fall 2014, the institute will develop a year-long, executive-style training program to be held in Washington, D.C., and Phoenix, Ariz., aimed at mid-career professionals working in higher education. The curriculum will be divided into modules that will each focus on a different challenge threatening the future of higher education, such as reshaping organizational culture and momentum for long-term success, designing new sustainable financial models for higher education and partnering with other institutions and providers to combine strengths.
“As we continue initiatives, like ‘Designing the Future(s),’ like the collaboration between ASU and Georgetown that we celebrate today, we create new ways for our communities to reaffirm and reinvigorate our commitment to these aspects of our shared work,” DeGioia said.
Selingo emphasized the importance of combining two very different universities, with two different perspectives and experiences, in pursuit of a common goal.
“The reason that we like it for this program is that it brings together a public university, a private university, one on the east coast — the nation’s capital — one on the west coast in one of the nation’s biggest, fastest-growing states, and it’s dealing with a lot of big issues,“ Selingo said.
Rankin agreed, adding that ASU’s larger size of over 30,000 students and the resulting larger number of courses and online degree options will provide Georgetown with a wider range of perspectives to pull from in developing the new program.
“ASU is different from Georgetown, and we view this as a tremendous benefit in helping us engage more deeply in conversations about higher education today,” Rankin wrote.
The panel primarily discussed the impending leadership crisis in higher education due to the lack of training within higher education for professors who wish to advance to leadership roles.
“And really, unlike many other industries, higher education does not have a deliberate pathway to the presidency. There is no really deliberate training program, so for example, you know leaders go usually and get an MBA. There’s nothing similar in higher ed, so that’s what we’re trying to build,” Selingo said.
Additionally, the median age of university presidents is 61, posing a problem for future leadership in the next decade.
“It takes time to become a full professor. So if you’re appointed as an assistant professor when you’re 25, 26, you serve six years in that role, and then you become an associate professor, and you serve six or seven years in that role, and then you become a full professor, and you’ve got to regain some maturity in that institution. I think the fact that we tend to look inside the academy … I think just that by that very nature it’s going to drive the age of the CEO, the president, higher on average than you might see in the corporate world,” Kirwan said.
