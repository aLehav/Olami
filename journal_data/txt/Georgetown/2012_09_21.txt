The recent arrival of car2go in the Georgetown area provides yet another car-sharing option for students and residents.
The company’s distinctive blue-and-white Smart cars have steadily gained ground in D.C. since their launch in the city on March 24. They can be rented on an immediate basis.
Though car2go’s expansion into the neighborhood comes on the heels of Georgetown’s recent agreement withZipcar, another car sharing business, car2go officials expressed confidence about their ability to tap into the student market.
car2go vehicles can be used for any amount of time and, after a one-time membership fee, users are charged only for the time they use the car. In addition, the cars may be picked up and dropped off anywhere within the designated “home area” upon ending the rental. Unlike Zipcar, car2gohas no monthly fees or security deposits, whereas Zipcarhas either a monthly commitment or annual fee, depending on which driving plan is selected.
According to a statement from car2go, full-time college students between the ages of 18 and 20 are eligible for membership. Zipcar has not offered membership to Georgetown students who are under 21, but rental privileges may soon be extended to 18-year-olds, pending negotiations between the university and the company.
In addition, car2go is offering discounts to attract new student users.
“We are currently waiving the initial registration [of] $35 for college students, plus [adding] 30 minutes of free drive time,” the statement said.
Katie Farrell (COL ’16) has never used the car2go system before but expressed enthusiasm about the benefits it could present for college-age students.
“I would love to use it to visit my friends at other universities that are off the Metro line but still nearby,” she said. “And I like that they are energy efficient.”
However, Kaitlin Carano (COL ’13), who has used competitor Zipcar for a variety of purposes, expressed doubt about the usefulness of car2go.
“The [lack of] reservations and [ability to] return it anywhere are kind of nice, but I do know that the size is kind of an issue for me,” she said. “You can barely fit your groceries in a Smart car so I think it could be used as a quick way to get somewhere, but I probably won’t use it as often.”
While Zipcar offers a wider variety of vehicles for rent, including luxury cars, hybrid vehicles and pickup trucks, users are required to make a reservation, and the cars must be returned to the parking spot where they were obtained. Five Zipcar parking spots are located on Georgetown’s campus outside of McDonough Arena.

In honor of the bicentennial of the War of 1812, the Georgetown University Library Associates and the Lecture Fund invited archivist David Ferriero to speak on the history of the National Archives in Lohrfink Auditorium Tuesday.
Ferriero, who was appointed by President Barack Obama as the 10th archivist of the United States in 2009, leads the National Archives and Records Administration, which protects and maintains the original U.S. Constitution, Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights.
University librarian Artemis Kirk introduced Ferriero and spoke briefly about Georgetown’s archives, which were established in 1816.
“[The archives] allow us to illuminate Georgetown’s past for current and future generations,” Kirk said.
Ferriero then provided the audience with a brief history of the National Archives, which were established in 1935 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Archives include over 12 billion pages, 40 million photographs and 100 million emails.
“We are the nation’s record keepers,” Ferriero said.
He later spoke about the importance of archived images in commemorating and researching the War of 1812 and exhibited documents ranging from a seaman’s protection certificate — a document that sailors carried before the war to guard against impressment — to President James Madison’s war message to Congress, the House Declaration of War and the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the war.
Trevor Plante, chief of reference for the National Archives, also spoke about the burning of Washington and the influential Battle of New Orleans.
“There were 2,000 casualties on the British side and roughly 70 on the U.S. side. That really shows you how lopsided the battle was,” Plante said.
The event was the first of several that the Library Associates will organize this fall. The audience included dozens of community members and a handful of students.
“I thought it was really interesting,” Karri Nelson (COL ’16) said. “Being a freshman, it’s great to come and listen to the national archivists of the United States.”
The staff and students of Lauinger Library were pleased with the event as well.
“This was one of our cooler events — having someone so high profile here,” said Elyssa Skeirik (SFS’15), who works as a library events assistant.

Though most students don’t give their SAT scores a second thought after high school, many recent or soon-to-be graduates are discovering that it is common practice for employers to require them on job applications.
According to Mike Schaub, executive director of Georgetown’s Cawley Career Education Center, certain consulting firms have asked job applicants to submit their SAT or ACT scores as part of the criteria for evaluating a candidate.
“I have routinely seen some employers ask for SAT [and] ACT [scores] over the years,” Schaub said. “If a job requires exceptional quantitative skills, for example, college admission test scores may provide one standardized source of data about the candidate’s quantitative abilities for the employer toevaluate.”
Nonetheless, he does not believe that Georgetown students, who he said tend to perform relatively well on standardized testing, face a disadvantage because of this increasingly common practice.
“It is important to remember that most employers consider a range of criteria when evaluating candidates for jobs,” Schaub said. “For some employers, standardized test scores provide just one piece of the puzzle. … The employer is likely to consider other measures of the candidate’s quantitative ability, such as grades in courses that integrate applied math, when making selections.”
Some students were comfortable with the idea of being required to include their scores on their job applications.
Daniel Feitel (LAW ’14) said that he would have no problem sharing his SAT scores with potential employers.
“Personally, I would be happy if an employer asked about my SAT scores, since it would be a chance to share my score without resorting to … actually putting it on my resume,” Feitel said.
On the other hand, Benjamin Mishkin (SFS ’13), who has applied to top consulting firms, wondered whether it was fair for employers to base even part of their decision on a few hours of performance four years before.
“One’s university achievements should absolutely override one’s SAT scores or what happened in high school,” Mishkin said. “Students should have the opportunity to mature, figure out what they’re interested in and good at and demonstrate it in college, and then be judged on that, instead of on how well they figured out the College Board when they were 17.”

Former national security advisers discussed national security in the United States and the Middle East in Gaston Hall Wednesday afternoon.
President and CEO of the Atlantic Council and former Assistant Managing Editor at The Wall Street Journal Fred Kempe moderated the panel, titled “National Security in the 21st Century.” The speakers included three former national security advisers: Brent Scowcroft, Stephen Hadley and James Jones (SFS ’66).
Scowcroft, who served as national security adviser to Presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush, opened the discussion by commenting on how the American government has changed its approach to national security since his retirement at the end of the Cold War.
“Now, the strategy is not a given. As a matter of fact, there is probably not a strategy, just tactics,” he said.
Hadley, former national security adviser to President George W. Bush, noted the increasing importance of a flexible approach to security issues.
“We need to shape and change our overall national security system,” Hadley said. “You have to have a vision for the future.”
Jones, who retired as President Barack Obama’s national security advisor in October 2010, agreed.
“Great powers decline when they don’t address the problems they have,” Jones said. “The world changed, the environment changed and they tried to hold on to the old model instead of the new one.”
Jones also emphasized the importance of addressing energy use in the United States.
“If you want to make a change in the world, energy is one of the areas where American leadership can be dominant,” Jones said. “We have more of everything within our borders than everybody else in the world.”
The advisers also discussed national security concerns in the Middle East, particularly in Syria.
“This [situation is] extremely complicated, and I think we need to talk more seriously with the Russians. Syria is their last hold in the East,” Scowcroft said.
However, Jones said he does not support a boots-on-the-ground approach in Syria.
“Virtual presence is actual absence,” he said. “You can’t just sit back and hope. Hope is not a strategy.”
Fan Zhao (GRD ’13) said he found the panel educational, though he did not agree with much of the discussion.
“I thought there were some valid points, [but] some … I disagreed with,” he said.
Zhao said he worried that such high-level officials would advocate more involvement overseas. “We’re in more conflicts than we should be,” he said.

AlumniFunder, a website that aims to connect Georgetown students with alumni who are working on startup ventures, will launch Sept. 29, according to site founder S. Ryan Meyer (SFS ’99).
AlumniFunder, a website that aims to connect Georgetown students with alumni who are working on startup ventures, will launch Sept. 29, according to site founder S. Ryan Meyer (SFS ’99).
The website is an electronic platform that facilitates the exchange of capital among “doers” — entrepreneurs who are looking to fund startup companies. According to Meyer, the site will rely on alumni’s relationships with their alma maters, tapping into the common bond of shared college experience to foster trust among site users.
“AlumniFunder wants to use that trust and expand that into an online environment,” Meyer said.
Although anyone can explore the site, only users with confirmed georgetown.edu email addresses can upload ideas and enter into discussions, Meyer said.
AlumniFunder will utilize crowd funding — a collective effort to network and pool resources — to fund startup companies.
“Crowd funding offers a certain democratization to the process,” Meyer said.
The idea for AlumniFunder arose after Meyer’s first attempt at a startup failed due to lack of funding. He began planning the site at the end of April.
According to Meyer, both students and alumni will benefit from the site because it will provide a common platform to pitch and discuss ideas and plans.
“Since you are driving the conversation, you can make that change,” Meyer said.
Though Georgetown is unaffiliated with AlumniFunder, Meyer said that it offers an opportunity for the university to use the site to raise money and potentially attain more notoriety as alumni create successful startups.
After its launch party at F. Scott’s next week, AlumniFunder plans to create fundraising networks for Princeton, Stanford and Harvard before the end of the year.

Former Georgetown University School of Medicine Dean and Chief of Urology William Maxted (C ’50, MED ’54) died last month at age 83.
According to an article in The Washington Post, Maxted died of pneumonia at Georgetown University Medical Center Aug. 20.
Maxted graduated cum laude from Georgetown College in 1950 and the School of Medicine in 1954, completing his residency at Georgetown University Hospital in 1961 after serving in the Air Force. He then worked in the hospital’s urology department for 50 years before his retirement in 2011, serving as chief of urology and program director from 1976 to 1989 and as dean of the School of Medicine from 1989 to 1998.
In an Aug. 23 letter to the GUSM community, Stephen Ray Mitchell, the school’s current dean for medical education and a professor of medicine and pediatrics, spoke of Maxted’s importance for the Georgetown medical community.
“No Georgetown physician has done more over so long a period of time to mentor our students in clinical medicine,” Mitchell wrote. “There are generations of gratitude from those who remember …Maxted’s superb teaching.”
Despite his death, Maxted’s legacy lives on in the Georgetown medical community in the form of the William C. Maxted Urology Award, which honors exceptional performance by senior medical students. An annual endowed lectureship has also been named for him.
Maxted is survived by three children, five grandchildren and two sisters. His wife, Claire Maxted, died in 1995.

Students running for seats on the Georgetown University Student Association senate launched their week-long campaigns Wednesday afternoon.
Voting for the 27 open senate positions will take place on Sept. 27. Currently, 66 undergraduates are running, almost half of whom are vying to represent the two freshman-only districts. New South and Village C West have 14 candidates, and Harbin and Darnall have 18 candidates. Meanwhile, one student is running for two spots in the district that includes Henle, and three students are running for five positions in the off-campus district.
“Typically, the numbers we see actually are that freshmen vote in a much higher percentage than other classes,” Election Commissioner Ethan Chess (COL ’14) said.
Senate representatives come from 12 geographically organized districts throughout campus and four at-large seats. Each district has a proportionate number of senators to reflect the size of the population it is serving.
Since senate seats correspond to housing assignments, each candidate’s term lasts one academic year. Chess said incumbents are just as likely to face competition as newcomers, since they are typically running in a new district.
“Some incumbents go down; some incumbents don’t,” Chess said. “A lot of it has to do with geography.”
Senate Transition Chair Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) said he is looking forward to incorporating new members because of the diversity they will bring to the senate.
“We’re going to have more candidates than ever,” he said. “We’re hoping to get people from groups we really haven’t had in the past … which will bring … new connections and new experiences that we can really incorporate.”
Tisa, Chess and GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) agreed that excitement, commitment and motivation are the most important qualities for a senate candidate.
“[A senator should be] excited to advocate for the needs of the student body and can apply their experience elsewhere on campus to that advocacy,” Gustafson said.
Tisa gave similar advice to the candidates at their first interest meeting, held on Monday.
“You [senators] just have to put yourself out there,” he said. “In the election, but then every day after that, as well.”
Gustafson outlined goals that she and the GUSA Cabinet, hopes to tackle in the upcoming term.  She singled out the implementation of the Student Life Report, Code of Student Conduct reform and short-term sustainability improvement as her top goals.
“These past three years, GUSA has kind of re-established itself as a legitimate body for change at this university,” she said. “But a lot of that came from financial reforms … and a lot of those financial reforms are now over and being started up. So seeing what the senate can do in terms of student life, intellectual life, et cetera. I think will be really great and will set the tone for a new path for GUSA.”

A banner in Red Square urging Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson to change the evidentiary standard in the Code of Student Conduct went missing Tuesday, according to a Georgetown University Student Association press release.
The banner included an abridged version of GUSA’s open letter to Olson. It was hung up Monday so that students could sign their names to show their support for a proposal to raise the evidentiary standard from “more likely than not” to “clear and convincing,” except in cases of sexual assault. It is also part of GUSA’s effort to raise student awareness of the upcoming referendum on the issue, which will take place  Sept. 27.
According to the press release, the banner, two poster boards and three permanent markers disappeared from Red Square before 8 a.m. Tuesday, and the Office of Campus Activities and Facilities denied responsibility for removing the items.
“We are dismayed that, for whatever reason, someone has chosen to stifle free expression on this extremely important issue,” the release read.
GUSA Vice President Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) said she believed someone must have deliberately removed the banner.
“It’s very unlikely that it blew away,” she said. “I’m very sad about it. It was student money that went into that poster.”
GUSA replaced the letter with a new banner, which hung in Red Square until it blew away Thursday.
Voting on the evidentiary standard referendum will occur concurrently with GUSA senate elections. Students will be required to vote for GUSA senators before they are able to vote in the referendum.
According to GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13), because the referendum must receive at least 2,000 votes to pass, the decision to hold the two votes concurrently should raise the profile of the senate elections, which have typically attracted relatively low voter turnout.
Although the referendum will not carry the authority to alter the evidentiary standard, both Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount emphasized that the referendum’s influence should not be overlooked.
Gustafson referred to an instance in January 2007 in which the administration chose not to ban kegs from Georgetown housing after a majority of students rejected the proposal in a fall 2006 GUSAreferendum.
“Let’s say, if 2,000 students vote and 90 percent of them vote yes, it’s that much harder for the administration to justify a decision when such an overwhelming number of students know what’s in their best interest and express that,” Kohnert-Yount said.
George Spyropoulos (COL ’14), a member of the Speech and Expression Committee’s external board, agreed that the referendum will give students the opportunity to grasp more leverage in the evidentiary standard debate.
“I was glad to see that, after meeting with students from all four years, they all had the same enthusiasm and support for the referendum,” Spyropoulos said. “I think it’s very important for GUSA to give the [students] an opportunity to raise their voices.”
Olson, who has delayed making a final decision on the change until the Office of Student Conduct undergoes an external review in October, said last week that he has received student input and understands the urgency of the matter.
“Student leaders have been very eager to see a final decision on that. I understand that eagerness. I understand the importance of the issue,” he said. “It’s my judgment that it makes the most sense to fold that question into this review, since we’re very quickly doing this comprehensive review.”
Olson said he will decide whether to raise the standard by mid-October.
“It’s not something that will take a long time after the review, but I do want a little bit of time to talk with the reviewers and digest that after they’re here,” Olson said.

A Catholic studies seminar that began last year is making waves in an effort to provide clean drinking water in Africa.
Taught by Fr. Richard Curry, S.J., the seminar, “Kenya: Clean Water Project,” was first offered last January. The class was conceived by Matt Demicola (COL ’13) and Pat Clancy (MSB ’13), who approached Curry with the idea.
The seminar does not resemble a typical Georgetown course; it is not offered directly through the university registrar, and each class session involves organizing and managing a business, that raises money to provide potable water in Nairobi, Kenya. The business will be called Clean Water H2OYAS,
“We want to make a major contribution to clean water in Africa and work with the organizations already in existence so they can lean on the generosity of this university,” Curry said.
Demicola and Curry hand-picked students who they believed would contribute to the organization. According to Curry, the pair was looking for students who were passionate and eager to make a difference.
“We were looking for zeal,” Curry said. “We were looking for people with a business background, but even if they didn’t have that, if they had zeal, we wanted them.”
There are currently 10 students in the course, most of whom are seniors. Despite the unique registration process and basis of the class, all students are graded to ensure they pull their weight.
“It helps push accountability,” Clancy said. “There are a lot of organizations who have members that are not as involved as maybe they could be, but — knowing how much everyone at Georgetown cares about their grades — the fact that we’re getting graded pushes us to accomplish our goals.”
Last year, the organization raised $4,000 for Sister Mary Owen, who co-founded the Nyumbani Children’s Home, Kenya’s first facility for HIV-positive orphans, with Fr. Angelo D’Agostino in 1992.
This year, the seminar chose to focus on two main goals: It wants to become incorporated as a nonprofit organization and seeks to actively build a well in Nairobi instead of only donating the money they raise.
While the seminar focuses on how to create a business, Demicola emphasized that it also incorporates the study of Catholic values.
“We don’t necessarily just focus on the business aspect and then the moral. It all intertwines,” Demicola said. “We’re driven by the Catholic moral theology and also want to do this in an appropriate business manner.”
The organization’s emphasis on Catholic values, which uphold that clean water is a basic human right, benefits from Georgetown’s network of Jesuits.
“This is not going to be a mission accomplished solely by 10 Georgetown students and a Jesuit priest,” Clancy said. “We’re going to have a lot of help from Jesuits over in Kenya, and there are Georgetown connections to St. [Aloysius Gonzaga High School, a coeducational jesuit high school in Nairobi]. It’s definitely an ambitious goal, but it’s something we think is possible.”
Although most participants are seniors this year, the organization will continue to pursue its goal next year by recruiting new members who share a passion for helping others.
“The organization will continue, and so will the class,” Demicola said. “It will be kind of a legacy.”

The Information Technology Executive Steering Committee, a newly established group chaired by Chief Information Officer Lisa Davis, will seek to establish priorities for the development of new information technology on campus in the coming year.
Members of the committee include deans from all schools and senior administrators in the university.
“The purpose of that committee is to, for the first time, bring visibility to what our IT strategy is so we make better decisions and establish priorities for IT investments,” Davis said.
According to Davis, it is inefficient for each school to make individual decisions about investments in information technology.
“With today’s budgets … as constrained as they are, we need to do smarter business, we need to make better decisions and we need to find those efficiencies and how we use and leverage technology across the university,” she said.
According to Davis, Georgetown partnered with Dell Consulting over the summer to conduct an assessment of the university and build an IT strategy for the next three to five years.
“The assessment was both qualitative — conducting over 60 interviews with senior leadership and key stakeholders across campus — and quantitative — assessing IT infrastructure, application portfolio, security and organization and financial models,” she said.
Davis pointed out that the assessment has allowed the university to restructure the university information system to provide updated services.
Modernizing infrastructure, creating a balanced security posture and transforming the university information system are the top three priorities for the semester, Davis said.
Although network modernization, such as completing Wi-Fi coverage, will span an extensive period of time and involve a multi-million-dollar investment, Davis stressed that the project is key to the university’s future development. Davis is currently focusing on expanding Wi-Fi coverage in the Southwest Quad.
“If we want to talk about globalization, if we want to talk about online learning, if we want to talk about extending the campus the next 100 acres, all of that has to build on a solid modern foundation,” Davis said.In addition to the Information Technology Steering Committee, a Faculty Advisory Committee was created to supplement the existing Student Advisory Committee.
Davis explained that the two committees will communicate with her directly to provide both faculty and student opinions regarding technology and to appeal to the Executive Steering Committee on funding issues.
“The nice thing about having the steering committee is that you have all the leadership there. A decision can actually be made of what it is we want to do,” Davis said.
According to Chief Innovation Officer Michael Wang (MSB ’07), the Student Advisory Committee and the h.Innovation Team, another initiative under UIS, will collaborate to advise the CIO and carry out several projects.
Michael Crouch (MSB ’13), a member of both the h.Innovation Team and the Student Advisory Committee, said that the second round of the h.Innovation Summit, a hackathon, will be held in November. The event will aim to promote collaboration on IT projects.
According to Davis, the summit will bring together students, faculty, staff, alumni and representatives from various companies such as Google, Facebook and Teach For America to brainstorm solutions for two main campus issues.
“The two problems are, how do we currently use our common space? … [And] how can we reinvent the way we create and collaborate in these spaces?” Davis said. “The other target area is the classroom. How do we currently use our classroom? Can we reinvent the ways we use our classrooms to help students better learn in these spaces?”
The CIO’s office is also in the process of developing a technology student fellows program, which will allow underclassmen to work with the CIO on IT issues.
According to Crouch, the students who are selected for the fellowship will be given the resources to complete university IT projects and write theses on design and technology.
Davis expressed excitement about the impact that each project will have on the university.
“For the first time, [we are bringing] unity and synergy to what we’re doing for Georgetown IT,” Davis said.

Peace Corps Chief of Staff Stacy Rhodes discussed his organization’s role in international development on Tuesday.
The talk was held in Intercultural Center as a part of the School of Foreign Service’s Global Human Development program.
Rhodes entered the Peace Corps in the late 1960s to pursue a life of international service.
“It was a life-determining, life-changing experience in many ways, and [without it,] I certainly wouldn’t have taken the career path I had and wound up where I am today: back at the Peace Corps,” he said.
Founded in 1960 by Senator John F. Kennedy (D-Mass.), the Peace Corps is a volunteer organization that works to promote outreach and cooperation in developing countries.
“You know with Peace Corps, the one thing you really do gain after a couple of years is something that you can’t gain in school, which is this ‘hot-stove’ understanding of what it means to be poor in this world and what a struggle it is for the vast majority of people in the 130 developing countries of the world,” Rhodes said.
He also spoke about the challenges of working in the global development field.
“It’s not easy to pick up and move everything, including your spouse, your kids, your possessions [and] your pets every three or four years to another continent and take another job with another language and another group of people,” he said.
But the job also comes with its fair share of rewards. According to Rhodes, the Peace Corps is uniquely designed to allow Americans to experience life in a developing country.
“Peace Corps is the only volunteer organization in which young and old Americans commit to go out to the village level, to that last mile, and stay there two years to learn the local language, to understand the people and the culture of the area and to work for two years to create opportunities [which] otherwise didn’t exist,” he said.
During his talk, Rhodes encouraged students to apply to the Peace Corps and advised them to study foreign languages and cultures and to engage in volunteer work as preparation.
Rhodes’ account of his experience with the Peace Corps and his original interest in global development resonated with members of the audience.
“I was fascinated by Chief of Staff Rhodes’ career trajectory, and it was very inspiring to hear his reasoning behind why he got into development and why he continues to work in development,” Michaela Core (GRD ’14) said. “At the heart of everything he does is his belief in the mission of the organization for which he works.”

To accommodate a spike in student interest, the Arabic and Islamic studies department has undergone recent expansions — but not without some growing pains.
This fall, the department has increased its presence on campus, in part by organizing two lecture series for the year, but it has also struggled to keep up with demand for enrollment.
It took two weeks for Matt Lightfoot (SFS ’14), who waswaitlisted alongside about 20 other students, to get into a second-year Arabic course.
“It was a huge pain,” he said. “It was not fun … not knowing every day whether I’d even be able to take Arabic.”
When he worked with the department to find a spot in a course, Lightfoot was told that there were not enough professors to meet the demand for classes. Eventually, he was allowed to join a class that had already reached its capacity of 16 students.
“They pretty much caved and … gave the professors authorization to sign add/drop forms and increase class size,” Lightfoot said. “It’s working out so far, but it’s not ideal.”
The rapid upswing in student interest — a Modern Language Association study found that the national number of university students enrolled in Arabic language classes increased by 46.3 percent between 2004 and 2009 — coupled with internal changes — has forced the department to innovate.
“In the past few years, our program has moved to include more content-based courses, such as those on Islamic civilization and culture. Here, students write and communicate in Arabic, and we offer content courses in both Arabic and English,” Director of Undergraduate Studies Reem Bassiouneysaid.
These shifts have come with some challenges. Nick Childress (COL ’14), a student in advanced intensive level I, spent an uncomfortably long time on the waitlist at the beginning of the semester expressed annoyance with the department’s apparent lack of a unified teaching method.
“Some people use the book; some just ignore it. Others just won’t teach certain parts of Arabic,” Childress said. “They’re just all over the place.”
At the same time, he lauded individual professors within the department.
“I mean, they wrote the book,” Childress said, referring to the fact that the textbooks used in most Arabic classes across the country were published by Georgetown University Press. “I definitely get the impression that [Georgetown professors] are better than any other professors out there.”
Many professors in the department are well regarded in their field, including professor John Esposito, director of the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding and an authority on the Islamic world, and Bassiouney, who is a prize-winning Arabic fiction author.
While some students chose Georgetown’s program based on its reputation, others simply stumbled upon it.
“My freshman year, it was the popular thing to do,” Charlie Caris (COL ’13) said. “So I signed up for a class and ended up loving the professor.”
Alli Heymann (SFS ’16), who is taking her first Arabic course this semester, expressed similar enthusiasm for the program.
“It’s intensive, but I like the repetition and being constantly immersed,” she said.
While the department still has issues to address caused by the jump in its popularity, Caris was optimistic about Arabic at Georgetown.
“On the most important issues, they’ve done a fantastic job,” he said.

Amid some controversy, the Citizens Association of Georgetown has begun installing private security cameras around the neighborhood in an effort to deter area crime.
Following discussions that began in June, CAG composed an installation plan and released a public statement about the project in December 2011. Since then, a pilot program featuring three cameras has been launched. Currently, only one of the cameras is operational.
According to CAG President Jennifer Altemus, camera installation was identified as an alternative safety measure to the reimbursable Metropolitan Police Department detail that the organization has been funding.
“The [Business Improvement District] had been talking about [cameras] for a while, and our reimbursable detail wasn’t working out. We had some extra money and decided to invest,” Altemus said.
Georgetown resident Bill Dean, CEO of the technology systems service provider M.C. Dean, Inc., provided the initial cameras for the project and the electronic resources for the installation. Further funding will be obtained from donations and CAG membership fees.
“We still are working on getting the first one up and running,” Altemus said. “But if they work well, we have the budget for 10 at this point.”
The CAG-owned cameras will supplement two security cameras that MPD already operates in Georgetown. In addition, a camera above Martin’s Tavern funded by residents of N Street and neighboring businesses has been operational for four years, according to an article in The Washington Post.
The cameras will be installed throughout the neighborhood and will aim to survey the main entrances and exits to the area. According to Chair of CAG’s Public Safety Committe Diane Colasanto, signs will be used to alert the public to the presence of the cameras.
The plan has faced opposition from area residents, who felt uninformed about the project and are wary of their privacy. The Georgetown Forum, a CAG-run online exchange among Georgetown citizens, revealed much disagreement about the merits of installing CAG-owned cameras around Georgetown.
Colasanto, refuted possible privacy concerns, stressing that while the camera footage can be reviewed by investigators after a crime has been committed to provide evidentiary support, the cameras will not be actively monitored.
“The main purpose we see is deterrence,” Colasanto said. “We have developed a set of procedures that have determined which images can be accessed and who can access them.”
Still, Tom Birch, a commissioner on Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, questioned the effectiveness of surveillance cameras in combating crime.
“I would say that I have no quarrel with the utility of cameras after [a crime has been committed],” Birch said. “But you watch the nightly news and see these robbers on tape. People know that the camera is there, and that is my concern, that they are not having a preventive effect.”
In addition, Birch expressed concern that the presence of the cameras would create an undue sense of complacency.
“There would be the presumption that the cameras are having a preventive effect,” Birch said. “[People] wouldn’t lock their house doors [and] wouldn’t do all the things that police tell us to do to protect ourselves and prevent crime.”
Altemus disagreed.
“The primary goal is to be a deterrent to crime, and the secondary goal would be to help catch criminals after,” Altemus said. “I can’t imagine that people would feel complacent or safer from having a camera four blocks away.”
John Hedgecock, lieutenant for MPD’s public service area 206, which includes Georgetown, spoke in support of CAG’s plans to install cameras at the ANC’s September meeting.
“I’m a proponent,” he said. “Any tool I can have in my toolbox, I’ll take.”
To allay privacy concerns, Hedgecock added that footage from MPD’s cameras is also subject to strict privacy standards, and only officers with specific authorization are allowed access.
Gwendolyn Crump, director of MPD’s office of communications, confirmed the legality of the privately owned cameras.
“We support the efforts of residents and businesses to secure their own property,” Crump wrote in an email.
Two more cameras are scheduled for installation within the next month. CAG will decide in the coming year whether to purchase additional cameras and where to place them.
Colasanto is optimistic about the prospects for the new program.
“Everybody has been wanting a camera on their street,” said Colasanto. “Maybe now, people who come to Georgetown and commit crimes will think twice.”
