Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, a distinguished professor of diplomacy at Georgetown University, received the 2018 Raymond “Jit” Trainor Award for Excellence in the Conduct of Diplomacy at a Gaston Hall ceremony Monday afternoon.
The Jit Trainor Award, named after former registrar of the School of Foreign Service Raymond “Jit” Trainor, is presented annually by Georgetown’s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy. Past recipients of the award include United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein last year and former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz in 2016.
In an accompanying lecture titled “Diplomacy in Defense of Democracy,” Albright told a crowd of diplomats and members of the Georgetown community that rising isolationist sentiment poses a significant threat to democracy.
Albright served as the 20th United States ambassador to the United Nations from 1993 to 1997 and as the first female secretary of state from 1997 to 2001 under former President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68). Since 2016, Albright has served as the Michael and Virginia Mortara distinguished professor of diplomacy at the School of Foreign Service. Her commitment to diplomacy and policy advocacy distinguished her for the award, according to an event invitation.
In the lecture, Albright said her diplomacy and policy advocacy have focused on the need to unite theory and practice, which aligns with the mission of the ISD.
“One of the reasons why I was really excited to come to Georgetown to teach was that I had seen that disconnect, and I really was very happy to be a part of working on some connection,” Albright said. “I knew that this university was committed to bringing the communities [of theory and practice] together, and I really am pleased to see that continue.”
Albright also condemned what she said were failures to promote democracy around the world on the part of the administration of President Donald Trump.
“Instead of rebutting and challenging anti-democratic forces across the globe, we now have a president who has become a source of comfort to them,” Albright said. “His administration has also simultaneously expressed disdain for diplomacy and seems content for the United States to take a back seat in international affairs, which has worried our allies and delighted our competitors.”
Ultimately, the current administration is threatening key tenets of American democracy, Albright said, which she finds troubling.
“Just in the past year, we have seen this administration step away from America’s historic commitment to human rights, withdraw from key international agreements such as the Paris Accords and TPP and transform the U.S. from a partner to a pariah at the United Nations,” Albright said. “It also tried unsuccessfully so far to slash the State Department budget, with the latest proposal announced earlier today.”
According to Albright, the fragile state of international cooperation today mirrors the struggles of previous eras. She noted parallels with the Cold War and the Vietnam War.
“I received my master’s degree some 50 years ago this spring, and like today, it was an era of great turbulence,” Albright said. “Here at home, America was divided along geographic, racial and cultural lines. Overseas, people called our policies arrogant, imperialistic and doomed to fail.”
Bearing the current political situation of the United States in mind, she argued that defending democratic ideals should be a cornerstone of American foreign policy, undeterred by the proliferation of anti-democratic propaganda on social media by authoritarian states like Russia.
“Social media has disaggregated voices and made governing more difficult, and in recent years, it has been co-opted by freedom’s foes, who are now adept at polluting social media platforms with rumors, disinformation and authoritarian propaganda,” Albright said. “All this led people to declare that democracy is in crisis.”
While all of these factors present unique challenges, the United States and NATO must not fully retreat from their duties of promoting democracy around the world, Albright said.
“It recalls the narrow-visioned naysayers who flourished in the 1920s and 1930s, the people who rejected the League of Nations, embraced protectionism, downplayed the rise of fascism, opposed help to the victims of aggression and ultimately endangered our own security, claiming all the while that all they were doing was putting America first,” Albright said. “The isolationists were wrong in the 1930s, and they are wrong now.”

What a fabulous woman.  As a GU alumnus, I’m so proud that she is there.  As the US Secretary of State, she once said to respond to the Cuban military’s shoot-down of unarmed civilian planes in February 1996 by condemning the Cuban pilots, who had used the Spanish word for testicles on their radios to congratulate themselves. “Frankly, this is not cojones,” she said. “This is cowardice.”
This is one tough, classy lady.

As debate stalls in the U.S. Senate over a replacement to the rescinded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Georgetown University administrators and students are pushing forward with efforts to lobby for permanent legal protections for students without documentation.
On Sep. 5, the administration of President Donald Trump rescinded DACA, an administrative program instituted under former President Barack Obama that provided work authorization and legal protection to about 800,000 immigrants without documentation who entered the United States as children. The rescission included a six-month delay for Congress to find a permanent replacement.
Democrats in Congress tried unsuccessfully to include a legislative DACA replacement in the 2018 budget bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-K.Y.) said Tuesday that debate on an immigration bill would be limited to this week, as party leaders have struggled to reach a deal, according to Politico.
Georgetown will continue to support DACA recipients and advocate for the passage of the Dream Act, a legislative proposal that would provide permanent protection and a path to citizenship for DACA recipients. Rachel Pugh, Georgetown’s senior director for strategic communications, reaffirmed the administration’s commitment to students without documentation and advocacy for the Dream Act in an email to The Hoya.
“Georgetown is deeply disappointed that Congress has not yet passed legislation that protects DREAMERS,” Pugh wrote. “As the Senate debates immigration legislation this week, we will continue advocating for the DREAM Act and efforts to protect our DREAMERS. We remain committed to supporting our undocumented students and will work alongside peers, students and policymakers to protect DREAMERS.”
University administrators plan to push forward with Dream Act lobbying efforts. Since the fall, University President John J. DeGioia has led a campaign to advocate for the bill, including sending letters to members of Congress and alumni. DeGioia called the Trump administration’s rescission of DACA “unconscionable” hours after it was announced.
Georgetown’s Office of Federal Relations plans to continue its advocacy for the passage of the Dream Act, which includes collaborations with other institutions. Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming said his office has worked with other educational institutions such as the American Council on Education, an organization of U.S. colleges and universities, and 17 other Jesuit colleges to pressure Congress to find a legislative alternative to DACA.
Arelis Palacios, the university’s associate director for undocumented student services, said future assistance will be tailored to each student, but declined to detail the assistance currently provided to students without documentation because of the individualized nature of the services.
One of the resources available to Georgetown students without documentation is free legal aid through two Catholic Charities locations in Washington, D.C.
The Georgetown University Student Association continued its own advocacy efforts most recently by hosting a phone bank on Feb. 1. About 150 students called their representatives in Congress to express their support for legislation to protect DACA recipients, according to Chas Newman (MSB ’18), co-secretary of congressional relations on the GUSA Federal and D.C. Relations Committee.
Palacios said the Feb. 1 phone bank was an important effort by the Georgetown community to demonstrate collective support for protecting DACA recipients.
“This was a tremendous display of allyship from student leaders and peers in support of our undocumented student population,” Palacios wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Casey Doherty (COL ’20), also co-secretary of congressional relations for the GUSA Federal and D.C. Relations Committee, emphasized the role phone banks play in helping students voice their opinions about DACA. Doherty is currently running for vice president of GUSA.
“We’ve had a couple different advocacy weeks and events regarding DACA, but we have always done a phone bank because we think that reaching out directly is effective,” Doherty said.
In December, GUSA held a weeklong GUHeretoStay campaign, an advocacy week that included letter-writing, a phone bank and a social media initiative that culminated in a demonstration on Capitol Hill. Newman said students are considering a final push for legislation to protect “Dreamers” this spring.
“We want people who don’t necessarily fall within the community to care and understand that while you might not be a ‘Dreamer,’ the person sitting next to you might be, and is just as smart as you and just as engaged on campus and proud to be an American as you are,” Doherty said. “What we’re trying to do is make students aware and also make elected officials aware that students do care.”

When we consider the University’s overwhelming lobbying capacity, its support of Dreamers is paltry, cynical, and partisan.  The real human tragedy is not among our few very, very, very lucky undocumented Hoyas, but with the parents of Dreamers, with the parents of anchor babies, and with the thousands of abandoned wives, elderly, and children left behind, whole villages without men, back in our home countries.  
When the University wants to take this human tragedy seriously, I am easy to reach.  I would be glad to volunteer my time, and so would hundreds of other alumni, I am sure.  Georgetown could make an enormous difference, but now it is just pandering and swimming in the intellectual shallows.

Thanks for the comment Manny! Was this the sort of disingenuous, faithless rhetoric you used while propping up the Iraqi government?
The logical extension of your claim seems to be a central authority that decides whether men (interesting that you distinguished men) can leave their homes to support their families based on adherence to Republican family norms. I suppose you would argue that divorce should be illegal?
What is your home country, Manny? Could you point out two or three of these Amazonian villages that apparently exist there?

A student-led proposal for one-credit foreign language classes faces resistance from the Faculty of Language and Linguistics despite strong demonstrated student interest.
In a push to establish one-credit foreign language courses, members of the School of Foreign Service Academic Council have begun to survey students from across all four schools via Google Forms to gauge their interest.
Ines Oulamine (SFS ’20), a representative from the SFSAC, created and distributed the survey with the intention of taking the results to the SFS Dean’s Office and language administrators this semester.
So far, 175 students have filled out the survey; 61.7 percent of students who indicated their interest have already achieved proficiency, with 50 percent of those students earning proficiency in Spanish. Students from all four undergraduate schools have expressed interest, Oulamine said, though 85 percent of interested students surveyed were in the SFS.
If approved, students across all four schools at Georgetown could register for the one-credit language courses, but these courses would be highly recommended only for those students who have achieved language proficiency or completed an Advanced II-level class.
Faculty of Languages and Linguistics convener Josiah Osgood said SFS Dean Daniel Byman  presented the department  with the idea of one-credit language courses in October. After much discussion, the faculty collectively decided against the proposal, Osgood said.
“It is our collective view that while one-credit classes may make sense in some contexts, in general they are not a good fit for languages. We don’t think enough can be accomplished in one hour a week or the equivalent to make them worthwhile,” Osgood wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Osgood said one-credit language classes do not adequately meet the demands of language learning.
“Indeed, we think they potentially send a misleading message about what it takes to achieve or sustain true fluency. We explained this in an email to the SFS deans in October,” Osgood wrote.
Many students who responded to Oulamine’s survey expressed frustration that they could not currently fit two or more languages in their schedules.
Christine McNeill (SFS ’20) began a second language after completing her French minor last summer. McNeill said she sees the potential one-credit language courses as an opportunity to fit French classes back into her schedule.
“I miss taking a French class and I can’t do it; I literally won’t be able to graduate on time. So I feel like for people who completed their minors or don’t have room to take a language anymore, this would be a great way to supplement your courses while still continuing to study a language you care about,” McNeill said.
Oulamine began the initiative because of her own struggle to balance both Arabic and French courses in her schedule after attaining proficiency in French during the fall of her freshman year.
“If I wanted to take a French class on top of Arabic, I’d be looking at 18 credits a semester for two or three years, and that’s just not feasible for me,” Oulamine said.
Osgood, instead, pointed to the already available “language tables” as a way for students to maintain proficiency without creating new one-credit courses. The language tables, organized by their respective departments, meet regularly and allow students of all levels to practice their speaking outside the classroom.
Oulamine felt language tables did not provide the desired environment for maintaining proficiency.
“One credits are a lot more structured than that, and they are centered around a theme. Like the French presidency or the crisis in Venezuela,” Oulamine said. “Because the content of these classes, I saw this as a really helpful way for students to be able to maintain their language skills and discuss some current social and political topic happening in the country of that language.”
Oulamine said she believes this structure would have a positive effect on the Georgetown education.
“This would be a really great way to ensure students graduate in full confidence that they can speak that language,” Oulamine said. “My role on the academic council is to just mobilize as much student support as possible and to really show the school that this is something that a lot of us care about.”
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the chairs of the Language Department were presented with the idea of one-credit courses after the survey results had been collected. The presentation was given by SFS Dean Daniel Byman in October.
