MedStar Georgetown University Hospital has applied to build a $560 million medical and surgical pavilion, which will include 32 new operating rooms, 156 new private beds, a rooftop helipad and more advanced equipment.
If the proposal is approved by the city, construction will begin in late 2016 and end by 2020. The new pavilion would replace the hospital’s current parking lot by Darnall Hall and connect to the hospital.
MedStar President Richard Goldberg said that the 477,000-square-foot pavilion is a potential solution to the hospital’s limited space and the challenge of accommodating a high volume of emergency patients.
The existing hospital building will also be renovated with the intent to improve efficiency and accommodate new services.
“The overall goal of the project is improved patient experience and continuing to provide world-class care,” Goldberg wrote in an email to The Hoya. “To that end, we want to construct a building connected to the main hospital with a new right-sized emergency department. Our current emergency department is often cramped and can become seriously overcrowded.”
The hospital initiated plans for the project in 2010 and submitted a Certificate of Need application with the District of Columbia State Health Planning and Development Agency on Oct. 6. The CON proposal must be approved for the project to come to fruition.
“The CON is the first of several regulatory steps in the construction process,” Goldberg wrote. “While working on the necessary regulatory approvals, we have also been looking at design concepts with the university and the Georgetown community.”
According to Goldberg, the building will include additional facilities in its updated Emergency Department.
“The project also allows for improved traffic patterns, landscaping and the creation of more green space on the hospital campus,” MedStar wrote in a press release.
Goldberg added that the new building will enhance the patient experience in terms of both service and convenience.
“This new building will be a huge plus for our patients,” Goldberg wrote. “We will take our old, cramped footprint and gain a facility that accommodates patients with private rooms and the latest technologies and improve patient flow so patients can move easier and quicker through our hospital.”
Goldberg predicted the new construction will result in $1 billion gain for the greater D.C. area once the project is completed.
“This project will mean a big economic impact for the District when you think of employment of individuals and the taxes the District will receive,” Goldberg wrote. Additionally, Goldberg said that the project will beautify the campus by increasing green spaces around the front hospital entrance and improving parking with the construction of new underground garage.
“Green space … will give the property more of a ‘campus look’ for the area right up to Reservoir Road,” Goldberg wrote. “We think it will provide an attractive ‘Northern Gate,’ if you will, to the university.”
MedStar plans to hire several firms for construction, development management and design, including Clark Construction Group, Trammell Crow Company, HKS Architects and Shalom Baranes Associates.
“We looked for companies with a lot of experience in designing and constructing projects similar to ours, that is, large-scale health care facilities,” Goldberg wrote. “We have assembled an expert team in the merger of several companies to construct a building that meets our functional goals as well as our objectives for the aesthetic milieu of the university and the neighborhood.”
University President John J. DeGioia spoke about the collaborative process of the new construction in an interview with The Hoya last month. (“Q&A: DeGioia on Faith, A Campus Reconstructed,” A1, Sept. 25, 2016)
“That one is ambitious— a big, big project that we all need to get everybody in alignment regarding that. I’m pretty confident we’re going to be able to get alignment between all of the parties, because I think our expectations are reasonable and modest, and I think we just need to make sure that everybody is a part of it,” DeGioia said.
While Goldberg acknowledged the potential difficulties of such a large project, he remained optimistic.
“There could be regulatory hurdles or design modifications that need to be completed,” Goldberg wrote. “But we would comply with changes that we need to make to keep the project moving forward in compliance with regulations.”
Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh also highlighted the potential opportunities the new construction could bring to the university.
“The hospital’s plans to expand are consistent with the principles that are guiding the work the university has been engaged in to plan for the future here on our campus — to introduce new, high-quality green spaces and expand existing ones, to create a pedestrian-friendly campus, moving transportation away from the center of campus and to continue to develop a more residential living and learning community,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya.

Georgetown is an excellent teaching hospital, the best.I trained in  the Pasquerilla healthcare center if its still there in the department of ophthalmology.. But what I did not know before I graduated is some other things about Georgetown world renowed hospital. It deserves every bit of the 560 million to expand.

Georgetown will open a 2,500-square-foot art gallery in the Edmund A. Walsh Building in fall 2017 after receiving an unspecified donation from alumni Maria (CAS ’87) and Alberto de la Cruz (CAS ’89).
The de la Cruz Gallery of Art will serve as a space for travelling exhibitions and historical artwork from museums across Washington, D.C., as well as pieces from Georgetown undergraduate and graduate students. It will serve as a complement to the Lucile M. and Richard F.X. Spagnuolo Art Gallery, which opened in 1958, also located in Walsh.
The gallery will replace the Walsh Black Box Theater, which previously served as the university’s main auditorium. The donation was announced two weeks ago.
Art History Department Chair Alfred Acres said that the new gallery space will increase opportunities for students to showcase their work.
“We anticipate now being able to curate a fair number of our shows here at Georgetown,” Acres said. “This is a chance to dramatically expand the kinds of things that can be shown, and with a bigger space, it just multiplies the opportunities.”
The de la Cruz gallery will feature painting, sculpture and installation pieces, while the existing Spagnuolo Gallery will be used to display other types of art.
“One idea that we have approached but not settled on with the Spagnuolos is to specialize the gallery in photography and works on paper,” Acres said. “The actual gallery and lighting work especially well for such exhibitions.”
The university has yet to release an official statement on the donation. University Spokesperson and Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh did not respond to requests for comment.
The de la Cruz family of Miami, Fla., currently owns a private art collection. Alberto de la Cruz’s parents, Carlos and Rosa de la Cruz, operate the private de la Cruz Gallery in Miami.
In an interview with the Washington City Paper, Alberto de la Cruz emphasized Georgetown’s need for more spaces dedicated to exhibiting student artwork.
“Most universities have space to show art,” Alberto de la Cruz said. “There’s nothing like that for Georgetown.”
Alberto and Maria de la Cruz could not be reached for comment.
According to Vice President of Advancement R. Bartley Moore (SFS ’78), the addition of the de la Cruz Gallery is an important step in providing students with a liberal arts education.
“For the community of faculty and student artists at Georgetown, I think the commitment to the gallery shows that their work is important, more important than ever, in a university firmly rooted in the liberal arts tradition … especially when we’re all feeling some pressure to make a college education more preprofessional and more about employable skills,” Moore wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Moore cited this donation as a significant example of fundraising partnerships between the university and alumni.
“Fundraising is most rewarding, and frankly easiest, when something the university wants or needs to do aligns neatly with something our donors care passionately about,” Moore wrote.
The Walsh Black Box Theater, which is used by student theater and dance groups, will be closed by the end of the academic year to prepare for the construction of the new gallery. Director of Theater and Performance Studies Maya Roth said that the university needs to reserve more space for performing arts after the theater closes.
“We needed to be promised alternate venues,” Roth said. “Performing arts clubs are being taken care of, with us assured no sum loss of venues for rehearsal and for performance.”
In an email sent to performing arts faculty and student groups over the summer, Department of Performing Arts Administrative Director Ron Lignelli said that the replacement of the Black Box with the gallery will be beneficial to the arts community on campus.
“[The art department] for over 15 years urgently needed to increase its gallery footprint,” Lignelli wrote. “All told, we’re glad that art is going to get a space … and that our highly active ensembles will continue to enjoy space access for the flourishing array of rehearsal and performance experiences.”
According to Acres, the de la Cruz Gallery is an exceptional addition to the university’s art scene.
“I see this as transformational for Georgetown,” Acres said. “It’s not an addendum to our existing program, but it will provide for our community an entirely new kind of space for dealing with art right now and the place art has in our education and the world. We are genuinely excited about this new gift.”
Art history student Sarah Jane Kim (COL ’18) applauded the university’s effort to bring greater attention to the art world.
“I believe that this gallery opening will be a major step into growing Georgetown in the creative arts field,” Kim said. “I love attending the galleries and museums in the downtown D.C. area, but to have that at Georgetown would feel much more intimate and have its own charm of a Hilltop touch.

Walsh was bulit in 1958.  The Spagnuolo Art Gallery is not that old.

Also, didn’t the Washington City Paper report specifically say that it isn’t endowed?  Great if it were though.

Former Secretary of Defense and Georgetown professor Chuck Hagel returned to Georgetown this semester to assume the position of distinguished executive-in-residence. In his role, Hagel will engage with students in guest lectures and provide support and expertise to administrators and faculty in all four schools. Prior to his appointment as secretary of defense, Hagel was a professor in the School of Foreign Service from 2009 to 2013, specializing in geopolitical issues.
The Hoya sat down with Hagel earlier this week to discuss his new role, his experiences in the United States Department of Defense and the future of American politics leading up to the 2016 elections.
What about Georgetown brought you back?
When President of Georgetown Jack DeGioia called me and asked me to consider coming back to Georgetown, I was very pleased because I found my experience here for three years before I went to be secretary of defense to be as enhancing and rewarding as any experience I’ve had in my life. I respect the institution and the students. The opportunity to connect and make some contributions and … to be part of that in different ways was very attractive to me.
Are there any improvements you would suggest to the deans of the schools at Georgetown?
One of the reasons I’ve always thought Georgetown is an exceptional institution of higher learning is that they make the education here relevant to real life, and they’ve taken advantage of the fact that they are here at the center of the nation’s business, the nation’s capital, and they have access to current leaders and former leaders, both internationally and domestically. They’ve used that very effectively. I think to continue to build on that, to give students — no matter what school they’re in — a good foundation on what the issues are, thinking rather than just a rote participation in education, [are] what I like very much about this school.
How do you think your past experiences as secretary of defense and senator of Nebraska will inform your presence on campus?
Because of the last 20 years, I’ve participated in a lot of defining events that have occurred in the world. I think students are interested in my thinking and my observations, now that I’ve been away from that for a while. … I think they are always interested in hearing about that, and in particular, giving them an opportunity to ask questions. “Why did you think that?” or “Why did you do that?” or “Was doing that a mistake?” … It’s just that I’ve had the great privilege of being on this stage for the past 20 years, and having seen what’s happened, I think any institution of higher learning always puts some value on that.
What are you most proud of accomplishing during your tenure as secretary of defense? Is there anything you wish you had done differently? What have you taken away from the experience?
I don’t know of a situation I’ve been in throughout my life, in the private sector the last 50 years, that if I didn’t have the opportunity to go back and do it again, I wouldn’t find ways to do it better.
I think the things for me during the two years I spent as secretary of defense was putting a focus on the human dimensions of the men and women and families in the Defense Department that really hadn’t been given a lot of attention over the last 15 years. This country has been at war for unprecedented years: 14 years of war. We’ve never been at war that long in the history of our country … and that takes a huge toll on families and suicide rates.
So putting the focus on review of our health care system, review of every human dimension of those internal relationships, which are in fact the glue in the foundation of any institution. You’ve got to take care of your people, and the quality of your people is always the essence of an institution. It’s not the institution, it’s the people and the recruitment and retention of the best people, making sure their families are taken care of. I put a lot of time into that.
The last thing I would say is working with the military. The civilian leadership has to work very closely with our uniformed military. It doesn’t mean you agree with everything all the time, but you have to create an environment that’s conducive to listening. Turn your transmitters off and turn on your receivers. I think if America did that more often, we’d do better more often in the world. It’s just basic with dealing with people and getting their point of view. You’re always going to learn something that helps you make decisions.
What do you think it means to be a moderate Republican, especially in terms of the 2016 race?
I’ve always believed that the purpose of politics is to engage the people, give the people an opportunity to participate and as they do, they form some decisions and conclusions and elect leaders to govern. The ultimate objective is not to continue to win elections. The ultimate objective of politics is to govern a nation effectively … and unfortunately, we have found ourselves the last few years so politically unable because we’ve brought such raw partisan politics to governance that we’ve essentially paralyzed our government.
You can’t govern a nation of free people without listening to each other and coming to some conclusion. … This absolutism, that “I’m all right and you’re all wrong all the time” will paralyze a nation at a time when the world is dangerous, complicated and combustible.
People are losing confidence in American leadership around the world. … When you produce a society that doesn’t trust its leaders and its institutions, you’ve produced an environment in society that’s very dangerous. So, you have people like [Donald] Trump, [Ben] Carson and [Carly] Fiorina out there advocating that one of the primary reasons they should be elected president is that they have no experience. I’m not sure that’s a particular virtue, but in an environment where politicians and government are so lowly regarded that you all have screwed everything up, and the politicians have brought a lot of it on themselves sure, but we’ll get back to a new center of gravity. … Responsibility is the key function and objective of governance.
What security and defense issues are most pressing right now?
I think cyber is the most deadly threat of all. I say that because cyberattacks represent a very odious, silent attack. You don’t know when it’s coming, you’re not always sure where it comes from, who perpetrated it. … This is a real deadly threat to our security because it’s an economic threat, it’s a social threat and a security threat.
Nuclear exchange is still real and it’s going to be real. Weapons of mass destruction like chemical weapons and biological weapons are still threats. … The challenges are more complicated, more diverse, more varied, but we’ve always had challenges, and we have to be smart and wise with how we use our great capabilities to deal with it. We have tremendous capabilities if we’re smart enough to use them in a smart way with our friends and our allies. We can’t do it alone. No nation can do it alone, and we have to do it with others.

OUTober, a six-week long celebration of the LGBTQ community organized by the LGBTQ Resource Center and GU Pride, returned to campus this month in its 11th annual iteration with increased programming for transgender history and rights.
In conjunction with student organizations and academic departments, the LGBTQ Resource Center has organized 15 panel discussions, guest speaker events and social gatherings spanning the months of October, which is national LGBT History Month, and November.
GU Pride kicked off the month’s festivities with an event commemorating Coming Out Day in Red Square last Friday. Students expressed their solidarity with the LGBTQ community by unfurling rainbow flags, chalking murals with encouraging messages and participating in a photo campaign expressing their support for equality. Students were also invited to stride through a symbolic closet door at the event.
Other programs for OUTober include a conversation next Tuesday with Ali Liebegott, one of the writers of the Emmy-winning show “Transparent,” a Walk to End HIV next Saturday and a memorial service for victims of transphobic violence Nov. 19.
LGBTQ Resource Center Director Shiva Subbaraman said that Coming Out Day has expanded and evolved to encompass more fluid gender identities since the LGBTQ Resource Center was established in 2008.
“[OUTober] now goes through November to include transgender history and Transgender Day of Remembrance,” Subbaraman said. “I think transgender is the piece we have focused a lot more on this year, and we also focused a lot more on interconnectedness of identities.”
Subbaraman said that the events aim to promote diversity among LGBTQ students on campus.
“When most people think about gay people, they think of a gay white man, at best a gay white woman. They’re not thinking of people like me, who look like this and dress like this and walk like this, so I think for us, the biggest continued challenge is to make it clear to people that we are many communities, not one,” Subbaraman said. “We represent probably one of the most diverse cross-sections of this campus community and almost any other community you can think of.”
GU Pride President Campbell James (SFS ’17) said that OUTober engages the community in a conversation about identity on campus. GU Pride coordinated roughly half the events in OUTober and began gauging student interest in programming in July.
“For us, Coming Out Day is just the kickoff of OUTober,” James said. “But to me, it’s a way of showing that queer students are your friends, your roommates, that they’re in your classes, they’re your [residential assistants], they’re your [orientation advisors], they’re everywhere around school. It’s not the focus of any GU Pride events or its mission, but it’s really a celebration of our identities.”
GU Pride Communications Officer Grace Smith (COL ’18) said that Coming Out Day is one of her favorite events of OUTober. Smith said she particularly loves the t-shirts that participants wore that read “I am.”
“Of all the events that [GU] Pride does, this is the most important one to me,” Smith said. “‘I am’ is a very bold statement because I don’t think a lot of people in the LGBT community have the privilege to say ‘I am’ and add something after. I think it represents those people whose very existence is an act of rebellion and who are continually fighting.”
Coming Out Day also cemented a collaboration between GU Pride and the Georgetown chapter of Active Minds, a national organization that promotes mental health awareness among college students. The Georgetown chapter hosts dialogues and provides resources for mental health issues.
GU Pride and Active Minds jointly produced the “Dignity and Pride” theme for the Coming Out Day photo campaign.
According to Active Minds Marketing Chair Sylvia Levy (SFS ’18), LGBTQ and mental health are topics that deserve more attention from the community.
“The social stigmas attached to both mental illness and the social stigmas attached to gender and sexuality are really impactful on us as college students and in people in general, and the messages we get in society about who you’re supposed to be and who you’re supposed to like and how you’re supposed to think are very problematic,” Levy said.
Besides those regarding mental health, Subbaraman said that events in OUTober will tackle other stigmas confronting LGBTQ students, faculty and alumni.
“There is still a lot of job discrimination, and it’s not easy for gay people, especially trans, to get access to health care,” Subbaraman said. “It is not easy to find career paths that are open to them especially since they want to be out, so I think there are a lot of real struggles in the world for students who are LGBT, and I think empowering our students to think more broadly about their identity and what they can or cannot do is part of the work we do here.”
Marguerite Guter (SFS ’19), who participated in the “Dignity and Pride” photo campaign, said that Coming Out Day helped to foster an atmosphere of tolerance within the community.
“It showed everyone that it’s okay to be who you are and that you can publically identify yourself as whoever you are and other people will be there to identify as your supporters,” Guter said. “It was just a very positive experience for everyone involved.”
Smith said that at its core, the purpose of Coming Out Day extends beyond sexual orientation and gender.
“It’s important for everybody to come out and say something that they love about themselves, and it doesn’t have to be related to LGBT issues or those sort of identities,” Smith said. “Everybody has something worth celebrating, but we don’t do it enough. That’s why I think it’s important to set aside one day to do just that.”

The Council of the District of Columbia is considering the Universal Paid Leave Act of 2015, a bill that would guarantee 16 weeks of paid leave to all employees in the District who are parents of newborn babies — the most generous bill with regards to paid family and medical leave in the country.
The act’s proposed paid leave also covers adoptions, recovery from military deployment and serious illness of the employee or a family member.
Currently, three states — California, New Jersey and Rhode Island — have paid leave programs, though the maximum benefit is six weeks of partial paid leave.
Seven councilmembers, including its co-authors Councilmember Elissa Silverman (I-At Large) and Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large), introduced the bill at the D.C. Chamber of Commerce Government Affairs Committee on Sept. 10.
“Only 12 percent of Americans have paid family leave,” Silverman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Only 4 percent of low-income people have paid family leave. People shouldn’t have to choose between medical care and a paycheck. The bill allows people to spend time with their loved ones when it counts most — when a new child enters their family, in the last days of a parent’s life — and to care for themselves should they fall seriously ill.”
For the bill to pass and become law, it must have a hearing, be assigned to a committee and be approved by the Committee of the Whole, which includes all 13 members of the council. If approved, it will be put up for a vote at two full council legislative meetings and subsequently signed by the mayor.
Although the bill has the support of Councilmembers Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), Brianne Nadeau (D-Ward 1), LaRuby May (D-Ward 8), Kenyan McDuffie (D-Ward 5) and Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3) in addition to Silverman and Grosso, the D.C. Chamber of Commerce has declined to support it.
In a letter to Grosso, Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Harry Wingo outlined the Chamber’s concerns with the bill.
“There is a prevalent problem that needs legislative remedy and attempts to give an employee a benefit in a vacuum without looking at the total benefit scheme,” Wingo wrote. “None of those programs are funded solely by the employer. The Chamber believes this bill would be unprecedented and make the District of Columbia dangerously uncompetitive at a time when the District is trying to compete for every job it can get.”
Grosso maintained that the consequences of the bill for employers would be short-term.
“In the long term, this will improve workers’ productivity, families’ bonding and cohesion, improve public health measures and help our youngest residents do better in school,” Grosso wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In the short term, it will be an additional tax on businesses and some residents, but the long-term effects will outweigh that downside. The main opposition has been to the small tax on businesses, but as I’ve said, I think that complaint is short-sighted.”
In the private sector, the program would be funded entirely by employers. On the other hand, workers in the federal government, those who reside outside the District and those who are self-employed would pay into the program themselves through payroll taxes.
Harry Holzer, an associate professor in the McCourt School of Public Policy and former U.S. Department of Labor chief economist, said he is concerned about the consequences of increased burdens on employers.
“I think paid leave is a good thing for families and for children, particularly for low-income children,” Holzer said. “But I’m worried because I think that D.C. City Council is imposing a lot of mandates on employers. There’s a bunch of things that are already implemented or under consideration. Every time you put another restriction or rule on employers, you’re raising the cost of hiring in the city.”
Holzer predicted dramatic repercussions for both employees and their employers if the bill passes.
“In economic theory, there are a couple of things that employers can do,” Holzer said. “Number one, they can take the money out of workers’ paychecks, which I think in a lot of cases, they will do. Secondly, they just won’t hire as much. Or thirdly, they’ll move across the river to Arlington, Va., which is not imposing all these standards.”
He also expressed uncertainty about the balance between costs and benefits for both employers and their employees.
“I am torn because I do think that paid leave is generally a good thing,” Holzer said. “But it has to be balanced against other goals, like making sure that D.C. residents have jobs and not driving employers away.”
Paid Family Leave Campaign Manager Joanna Blotner said that she thinks the program will attract workers to the District.
“The reality is that businesses chose to locate in D.C. because we’re a very unique jurisdiction,” Blotner said. “If you’re doing government services or advocacy, you want to be in D.C. Our hope for this program is that you’re actually going to see a lot more people wanting to move to the District and wanting to stay in the District long-term.”
Blotner also addressed the impact this legislation could have on employees’ salaries.
“Ultimately, will this cost be passed on to the employee in some way?” Blotner said. “My guess is yes. The benefits package that you’re going to receive from a D.C. employer is going to be a lot higher because of this kind of a program. So your base salary might reflect that.”
She added that even if D.C.’s program is approved, it is just one contribution to a national concern.
“I think D.C. has the opportunity to really set a new national standard on this issue,” Blotner said. “But I think it’s important to remember what was done and what was created with this program really represents the bare minimum of what we need.”

The D.C. Metro is the first United States subway system to be placed under direct government supervision of the Federal Transit Administration due to lapses in safety regulations, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx announced Oct. 9.
Although everyday operations will continue under the Metro’s oversight, the FTA can perform unannounced facility inspections at any time.
This action was outlined in a letter from Foxx to National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Christopher Hart. The letter was issued in response to two “Urgent Safety Recommendations” from the NTSB made Sept. 30.
The recommendations were proposed as part of an ongoing investigation into an accident that occurred Jan. 12 in Metrorail’s L’Enfant Plaza, when the tunnel filled with smoke, resulting in the death of one passenger and sickness of many others.
The NTSB also recommended that the Department of Transportation seek legislative action and transfer the oversight of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority to the Federal Railroad Administration from the Tri-State Oversight Committee, which has been deemed ineffective by both the NTSB and the DOT. Instead, the DOT is handing the responsibility.
According to The Washington Post, Foxx said transferring supervision to the FRA would increase confusion and slow down improvements, as it would require congressional action.
“We take every recommendation of the NTSB seriously, including how quickly we can implement an urgent recommendation,” Foxx wrote in the letter. “In this case, we agree on the problem identified by NTSB, but believe there is a faster, more effective way to address it.”
Congressman Gerald Connolly (D-Va.) told The Washington Post, in an article published Oct. 9, that D.C. Metro safety should remain a top priority and questioned whether Metro oversight should be directed to the FTA and not the FRA.
“I look forward to learning more about Secretary Foxx’s proposal to ramp up FTA’s oversight of the Metrorail system but remain concerned that immediate, effective oversight not be victim to bureaucracy,” Connolly said. “Metro needs robust safety oversight today. And to perform that oversight we need an agency with the team and the regulatory tools to do the job today. According to the NTSB, that agency is the FRA, not the FTA.”
The measures also require that WMATA use federal funds to address certain safety deficiencies. The FTA will hold this position until D.C., Maryland and Virginia can establish a functioning State Safety Oversight Agency to replace the TOC.
Additionally, the FTA has already conducted a “Safety Management Inspection” and issued a safety directive consisting of a series of required corrective measures.
WMATA is also required to hire a general manager immediately, as it has been without permanent leadership since the retirement of Richard Sarles in January.
“[The manager must be] able to correct the course at the transit agency and aggressively manage the implementation of the Corrective Action Plan, which has been approved by the FTA,” Foxx wrote. “The urgency of having accountable leadership at the helm of WMATA cannot be overstated.”
According to The Washington Post, Metro’s interim general manager Jack Requa welcomes Foxx’s action.
“We will continue to work closely with the FTA to improve safety of the WMTA system and are fully engaged in implementing corrective actions recently approved by the agency,” Requa said. “We appreciate Secretary Foxx’s continued support and his leadership on safety oversight.”
Bridget McElroy (COL ’18) uses the Metro at least twice per week to commute to her internship, and spoke to its unreliability and need for increased safety regulation.
“I don’t think that the Metro is safe at all,” McElroy said. “A lot of the time it just stops at a station or in the middle of a tunnel and doesn’t tell you what’s going on, which is confusing and dangerous. It is also scary because they never tell you how long the train will be stopped for. The speakers never work and a lot of the time you can’t hear the conductors.”

Environmentalist group Potomac Conservancy launched an online petition this summer in protest of Trump National Golf Club’s 2010 decision to remove 465 trees along the Potomac River, claiming this construction has severely damaged the surrounding environment.
Donald Trump, a leading Republican presidential candidate and businessman, purchased 800 acres from Loudoun County in 2009 to create Trump National Golf Club Washington D.C., adding to his international portfolio of golf clubs that already has branches in the United States, Scotland, Dubai, Ireland and the United Arab Emirates. In the process, the club cleared trees along the river to provide unobstructed water views.
The Silver Springs, Md.-based Potomac Conservancy initially visited the club in 2010 and recommended several measures to restore the shoreline, but did not receive a response from the club, according to Senior Director of Communications Melissa Diemand.
“The action [of clearing the trees] has degraded water quality for outdoor enthusiasts such as fishers, paddlers, runners and bikers along the river,” Diemand said. “[Clearing shoreline trees] often negatively affects the five million residents’ drinking water that comes from the Potomac.”
The organization decided to bring attention to the issue again this summer after Trump visited the club in June and spoke about how he owns the longest stretch of unobstructed views along the Potomac. The petition, which opened on change.org in July, calls for Trump to donate 500 mature trees to be replanted on the riverbank in Loudoun County. More than 6,000 supporters have signed the online petition, which will close Oct. 31.
After the petition closes, Potomac Conservancy will call for Trump to donate trees to Northern Virginia Regional Park, which will then be replanted along the shoreline.
“Whether or not Trump does the right thing, we are going to push forward and fight for clean water at the local level so that this tragedy doesn’t happen again in our backyard,” Diemand said.
After removing the trees in 2010, the Trump Organization later planted 100 trees elsewhere in the club and placed a grass layer along the shoreline to prevent soil erosion. In July 2011, the Loudoun Soil and Water Conservation District initiated an investigation into the impact of the tree removal.
Conservation District Chairman James Christian noted that the Trump Organization has made a conscious effort to minimize potential damages to the Potomac River and local neighborhoods.
According to Christian, the Trump Organization was already working with environmental consultants before the District’s investigation began.
“Mr. Trump has not broken any laws. He perfectly has the right to remove the trees in his land,” Christian said. “Our relationship with Trump’s organization was amicable, and they were very cooperative.”
Glen Barbour, communications officer of the Office of the County Administrator of Loudoun, also confirmed that the county’s zoning regulations did not prohibit the removal of trees along the Potomac.
Prior to the investigation, then-Vice Chairman of the Conservation District Chris Simmons criticized the tree-planting, expressing concern that it did not protect the waterway and that county residents would face increased pollutants and sediments.
However, Simmons ended the investigation in November 2011 and told the Loudoun Times-Mirror that the study evolved into a cooperative partnership with Trump.
“The Trump organization feels very strongly that there is a lot of common ground and that conservation is a sound business practice and is open and eager to work with us, and we are happy to partner with them on conservation riparian practices here in the county,” Simmons said.
The Loudoun County government also recommended the club replant the removed trees, but did not have the regulatory authority to require such action.
Potomac Environment Research and Education Center Associate Director Dann Sklarew said he doubted that 500 trees alone would make a substantial impact on the ecology of the 400 mile-long river.
However, Sklarew also raised concerns that converting land into a golf club can pose an even greater threat to the environment, since large-scale clubs often use artificial fertilizer to keep landscapes green.
“If that fertilizer is applied close to the river … then it may adversely affect the nutrient balance there or downstream,” Sklarew wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Brett Walls, a member of environmental nonprofit Potomac Riverkeeper Network, also said that a use of fertilizers may become a larger problem than soil erosion.
“Compared to what comes downstream from up the river, [the erosion of the riverbank] is going to be pretty minute,” Walls said.
The Trump National Golf Club did not respond to requests for comment.

The Kennedy Institute of Ethics received part of a $3.6 million grant from the National Institute of Health to fund a joint study on the ethical concerns with conducting research on pregnant women with HIV in late September.
The grant was awarded to Georgetown and three other universities including the University of North Carolina, Johns Hopkins University and the University of Washington. Georgetown will share the funding with the other institutions.
The study, titled “Pregnancy and HIV/AIDS: Seeking Equitable Study,” is a four-year collaborative project led by Kennedy Institute of Ethics Director Margaret Little, the grant’s co-principal investigator, along with doctors and professors from the other universities.
The four universities first applied for the NIH grant in 2013 and received approval for a one-year project. After further development in 2015, the project was resubmitted and approved for a four-year grant.
Little said that the project aims to identify the perceived challenges of studying HIV in pregnant women, find ethical and legally sound solutions to these hurdles and provide advice to medical researchers.
To accomplish this, the project will conduct research, organize informative workshops and develop concrete guidelines for researchers looking to design trials with pregnant women. The project will reach out to researchers and patients in the United States, Malawi, Botswana and South Africa.
“Our aim is to give concrete guidance on how research can be conducted to ethically high standards and in ways acceptable to the regulations,” Little said.
According to Little, researchers are hesitant to conduct research on treating illnesses that involve pregnant women, despite the fact that pregnant women are at a higher risk of contracting HIV.
“Knowing how to dose medication during pregnancy, given the radically changed metabolism of the pregnant body, and knowing which medications have a proper risk/benefit ratio … is critical,” Little wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Health researchers usually avoid doing clinical research with pregnant women out of concern and confusion about the ethics of it. In fact, regulations allow such research.”
Liza Dawson, the research ethics team leader in the Division of AIDS at the NIH, said that the grant will provide valuable data on pregnant women suffering from AIDS. Pregnant women are at a higher risk of infection and often develop more severe symptoms. “We should be concerned about safety of the mother and the fetus and the ultimate safety of the infant … [but] because of those concerns about safety, there has been a big hesitancy to include pregnant women in studies,” Dawson said. “That’s understandable, but it has created a big problem in that we don’t have the evidence base for treatment of pregnant women.”
According to KIE Director of Communications and Project Development Kelly Heuer, the project grew out of the Second Wave Workshop hosted by Georgetown in April 2009, which focused on the inclusion of pregnant women in medical research.
“When the first group formally convened at Georgetown to examine the tangle of complex issues surrounding research on pregnant women, our sights were set very high,” Heuer said.
The grant was awarded to Georgetown and the other universities by an external panel of academic peer reviewers called a study section, which evaluated the project on its significance, investigators, innovation, approach and environment. NIH bioethics grants are only given twice per year.
Dawson said that the project may extend beyond HIV into providing health care for pregnant women with other diseases.
“I’m optimistic that this project can help us work on these ethical challenges in other areas,” Dawson said. “It’s good to remember that these are everyday issues that we all struggle with, about how to balance different risks and benefits or different actions that may have diverse consequences …. in a complex world.”
Heuer said she is proud of Little and the other project participants for taking on a complex problem that is often ignored.
“Maggie and the other leaders on this project are moving aggressively … to help the women and children who are harmed by our collective societal failure,” Heuer said. “I couldn’t be more proud of … the whole team’s commitment to making strides commensurate with the scope of the problem.”

The Georgetown University Student Association senate elected the second female speaker, Enushe Khan (MSB ’17), in the institution’s history Sunday, a move that reflects the growing diversity of the legislative body.
Twelve of this year’s 28 senators are women, which is the highest ratio in Georgetown’s history. The past two years saw 10 female senators in GUSA.
Khan, who previously served as the chairwoman of the Student Life Committee, is the first female speaker since Christina Goodlander (SFS ’07), who held the position in 2006, the senate’s inaugural year.
According to Khan, the number of women in GUSA has steadily grown in recent years, which signals a change in GUSA’s traditionally male-dominated culture.
“We are an inclusive body,” Khan said. “We want a GUSA that is representative of the student body. … They’re really trying to be a representative body and eliminate the ‘boy’s club’ vibe.”
GUSA President Joe Luther (COL ’16) said that Khan’s election is a positive step towards greater inclusivity in student government.
“The election of a female senate speaker is an important milestone,” Luther wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I hope this election works to change GUSA’s image. … GUSA, whether it’s the senate or the [executive branch], can only work when it’s representing everyone.”
Khan and Elizabeth Oh (SFS ’15), the longest-serving members in the senate, have each served for three years. Oh, who serves as the townhouse district representative and is the former chairwoman of the Intellectual Life Committee, said that Khan brings a significant amount of experience to the position.
“The past two years, she has dedicated herself to the Student Life Committee, including everything from dining to safety to sustainability,” Oh wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Khan said that she is committed to engaging with cultural groups that have been largely absent from GUSA proceedings, including the South Asian Society, the Latin American Student Association and the International Student Association.
“There are a lot of big, major groups here that are just not part of the conversation,” Khan said. “My goal as speaker is to sit down with [their] leaders, bring them in and figure out what core issues [their] group or community members are facing.”
The recent surge in GUSA’s diversity can be attributed to a variety of programs. Khan herself led a program called “A GUSA That Looks Like Georgetown,” a pre-election initiative that encouraged traditionally underrepresented student groups to run for office.
Another nationwide initiative, Elect Her, held a forum on campus in September encouraging female students to participate in student government.
Khan said that Elect Her encouraged her to run for senate two years ago, when she was apprehensive about running as a freshman woman of color.
“I won and that was a big shock, but I stuck with it,” Khan said. “Very few girls were in the senate, but there was still more than the year before.”
According to GUSA Secretary for Campus Planning Ari Goldstein (COL ’18), GUSA’s executive cabinet and staff, who are selected through an application process, typically have more equal gender ratios than the competitively elected senate, president and vice president positions.
“I hope Enushe’s election shows women on campus that they can and should get involved with GUSA,” Goldstein wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It’s especially important to have women at the table. … We are all strengthened when decision-making bodies become more representative of the communities they serve.”
Khan said that she plans on expanding the Intellectual Life Committee and reforming the Finance and Appropriations Committee. She attributed negative perceptions of GUSA to shortcomings in the two committees.
“Fin/App is the only body with the power to do something other than just advocacy,” Khan said. “My goal is to make it a more transparent body. … I’m trying to find a way to bring different students into the room from different advisory boards.”
Tyler Bridge (SFS ’17), the former GUSA speaker whose resignation led to Khan’s appointment, said that the Fin/App is in need of huge reforms, and that Khan’s biggest challenge will be changing the way the committee operates.
“Today, the system is corrupt,” Bridge wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Fin/App has become a monster run amuck and out of control within the current structure.”
As speaker, Khan will be responsible for publicizing the senate’s operations and maintaining order in GUSA. Other members of GUSA have said that she is well-prepared to lead in this regard.
“She’s a highly competent and exceptionally personable woman and I have no doubt that she will be a great success in her new position,” GUSA Vice President Connor Rohan (COL ’16) wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Goldstein, who worked closely with Khan in the senate last year, said that she was a valuable resource to him and other senators working on specific projects.
“I’m confident she’ll bring wisdom, policy expertise and phenomenal integrity to the role of speaker,” Goldstein wrote.
Correction: An original version of the article wrote that Khan led the Elect Her forum in September. She led the “A GUSA That Looks Like Georgetown” program.

Five contributors to “Children of Afghanistan: The Path to Peace,” a book on the lives of the country’s youth, participated in a panel at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs on Wednesday to discuss developmental issues in a country where one in four children dies before his fifth birthday.
The panel, titled “The Future of Afghan Children,” featured Avideh Shashaani, the founder of local nonprofit Fund for the Future of Children, Anne Brodsky, the director of the gender and women’s studies program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Lael Mohib, the founder of the Enabled Charity Initiative for disabled children in Afghanistan, Louise Pascale, an arts professor at Lesley University and Ashraf Zahedi, an editor of the volume.
The book consists of research and fieldwork from 21 experts on the lives of children in Afghanistan. The five panelists discussed the benefits of access to social services and education, the role of public policy and the rebuilding of Afghanistan.
Shashaani said that the struggles facing children in what the United Nations has called “the worst country in the world to be born” are often overlooked. According to Shashaani, around 50,000 children work on the streets of Kabul, the capital city of Afghanistan.
“We’re becoming numb,” Shashaani said. “We’re bombarded by statistics.”
Brodsky, who conducted 225 interviews with Afghan citizens between the ages of 13 and 85 with diverse ethnic and educational backgrounds, discussed the issues of childhood marriage and the lack of opportunities to education.
“We in the West owe it to them and so many others in the world to recognize the resilience of their strength,” Brodsky said. “Remember that for children, time is of the essence.”
Mohib said that the Afghan and international communities should prioritize initiatives for children with disabilities.
“I just became involved in this issue when I was volunteering with these children,” Mohib said. “I think it’s Afghanistan’s vision and mine … that those living with disabilities in Afghanistan will reach their full potential as human beings and be enabled to do so by their societies, their families and their government.”
According to Mohib, one in five families in Afghanistan has a severely disabled family member, and most disabled people in Afghanistan are under the 14 years old. Lack of prenatal treatment, complications at birth and war-related injuries are the most common causes of these disabilities.
“Recently, [disabilities] have not really been a donor priority,” Mohib said.
Pascale spoke about the importance of promoting music and literacy in Afghanistan. Pascale worked in the country between 1966 and 1968 with the Peace Corps and helped create a songbook for the children she taught.
“My heart stayed with Afghanistan,” Pascal said. “I started hearing about the music, and the censorship of the music, and I was distraught.”
In 2003, Pascal began to put together 5,000 songbooks in collaboration with the Afghan Embassy in Washington, D.C. Pascal said that this initiative was also an effort to increase the country’s literacy.
“Most of those schools where these songbooks were going had absolutely no books,” Pascal said.
Pascal said that education is essential to improving the lives of children in Afghanistan.
“If this is the generation that’s going to save Afghanistan, we need creative thinkers,” Pascal said. “We need problem solvers. We need critical thinkers. We need to teach those skills.”
Zahedi said trickle-down economics has not worked to tackle poverty in the country. Zahedi suggested that the Conditional Cash Transfers Program would be a short-term alternative, as it provides funds for mothers and female guardians to feed and take care of their children.
“This is just a Band-Aid … but Afghanistan needs a heart implant,” Zahedi said. “This will not change the power relations in Afghanistan. … We need to factor in the neglects that take place.”
Despite the problems plaguing Afghanistan’s children, the panel expressed hope for the future. Mohib highlighted some of the positive advancements in the country, such as the recent creation of a computer coding school for girls.
“I think … the media is often dominated by the challenges of what’s happening today in Afghanistan,” Mohib said. “The future deserves as much attention, and those who will lead us into the future: the children.”
