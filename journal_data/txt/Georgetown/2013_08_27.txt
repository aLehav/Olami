After passionate reactions from students and alumni to a preliminary design this summer, Sasaki Associates will reveal changes to the Northeast Triangle dorm designs at a forum Wednesday evening.
The forum, the second of its kind, will take place a week before Georgetown administrators and Sasaki are set to present their designs to the Old Georgetown Board on Sept. 4. The board, which must approve all construction in Georgetown’s historic district, postponed deliberations on the dorm in July until the university could present alternate options that appeared less final.
Sasaki spent the past month working to incorporate suggestions from the mid-July forum and address concerns of the OGB, students and alumni.
Student and alumni objections to the design’s modern appearance have been incorporated in the new proposal, which Vincent Gorgati, chief Sasaki architect for Northeast Triangle, said more clearly reflects the influence of Georgetown’s traditional architecture.
“The coloration [of the new dorm] was informed by Copley and White-Gravenor,” Gorgati said. “By all means that has been a very strong reference for this building and hopefully the evolution of the design will reflect that.”
However, Sasaki also attempted to incorporate the “duality” of Georgetown’s campus, or the marriage of stone and brick architectural styles.
“I think one of the key concepts that came out of that conversation with students was this concept of duality,” Gorgati said. “This is a campus that has, sometimes, not contradictory but complementary aspects. The recent buildings that have been built explore what it means to be a Georgetown building in different ways.”
The dorm has also been scaled down from housing 250 to 225 beds.
“The building is a little more modest in a number of ways than the previous version in terms of architecture, exterior and interior space,” Gorgati said. “What’s changed has to do with innovations. One important aspect of this is related to the use of technology and application of sustainable concepts to the building — green roofs … and natural light — which have a direct bearing on the building’s design.”
Students can expect to see multiple, revised designs that reflect feedback given at both the forum in July as well as in continued meetings with an advisory committee of students.
“I think what we’ll see on Wednesday are some new designs that really reflect and take into account things that most resonate with our community,” Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh said, confirming that multiple designs would be shown.
Georgetown University Student Association Director of Student Space Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14), who serves as a student representative on the design committee, has seen the designs that will be presented at the forum.
“I think through interacting with students, I feel like they’ve been able to capture Georgetown’s culture a little bit more and really create something that’s awe-inspiring,” Appelbaum said. “I think they’re really taking the time to incorporate the feedback, and it shows in what they’re presenting.”
The university and Sasaki Associates plan to continue communicating with students and alumni throughout the semester and year as designs for the dorm progress. To provice alumni with relevant information, the university will hold an online webinar Sept. 11.
“There’s still more to be done and a lot of it’s going to depend on what students are going to say at the forum,” Appelbaum said. “It’s still been in a fairly insulated group and you can’t really tell what feedback and what people think of it until it goes to a much bigger group, like the forum on Wednesday.”

In order to increase college affordability, President Barack Obama announced a proposal to reform the allocation of federal financial aid Aug. 22.
Obama’s proposal calls for student aid to be based on the value of a college education as determined by a new ranking system.
The new college-ranking system, which aims to help the middle class, would compare a college’s cost to its value. The system uses access, affordability and outcomes to score a university. Specific factors under consideration would include tuition, scholarships, loan debt, grant availability, graduation and transfer rates, graduate earnings and careers.
Under the proposal, students who attend high-performing colleges — or those designated a high value — would receive larger Pell Grants and more affordable student loans.
In order to increase the amount of financial aid they receive, colleges would actively pursue innovative methods to maintain or increase the quality of the education they provide. For example, Obama has previously cited the successes of online education and high school partnerships, which allow students to obtain college credits and graduate from college early.
“When it comes to the ‘value’ side of the equation, I am confident that Georgetown will stack up quite well,” Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming wrote in an email.
Fleming cited the low default rate on student loans for Georgetown alumni.
“The default rate calculated by the Department of Education for Georgetown alums is very low, an indicator that graduates are working and able to repay their student loans,” Fleming wrote.
Obama’s proposal attempts to alleviate education-related debt. Previously, Obama’s Pay-As-You-Earn plan capped loan repayments at 10 percent of a student’s post-college income. Under the new proposal, Pay-As-You-Earn requirements would be expanded to allow more students to participate.
“Higher education is still the best ticket to upward mobility in America, and if we don’t do something about keeping it within reach, it will create problems for economic mobility for generations to come. And that’s not acceptable,” Obama said in a speech at the State University of New York at Buffalo on Aug. 22. “Today, I’m proposing major new reforms that will shake up the current system, create better incentives for colleges to do more with less and deliver better value for students and their families.”

Bess Rosenzweig was worldly, in every sense of the word. She was an avid traveler, and she and her mother were vacationing in Kenya when the two were killed in a plane crash July 25, just 10 weeks after Bess graduated from Georgetown College.
Rosenzweig, 22, seemed destined for a life abroad. Born in London and raised in Cambridge, Mass., Rosenzweig had visited virtually every corner of the globe, from Venezuela and Bali to Greece and Sydney, where she studied as a junior. She was particularly fond of Africa, and was contemplating a job at a nonprofit in South Africa at the time of her death.
A psychology major with a minor in French and certificate in African studies, Rosenzweig was known for being passionate and thoughtful, enamored with exploring new places but disenchanted by some aspects of modern society. She was not particularly involved on campus, although her academic advisor, Sandra Calvert, said that Georgetown’s emphasis on social justice resonated withRosenzweig.
“I always thought of Bess as a Renaissance woman,” said Calvert, who also taught Rosenzweig in two psychology courses. “I think Bess was someone who always had her own inner voice. She had a clear vision of her own life and what she wanted out of it.”
Rosenzweig enjoyed traveling with her mother, Claire Clube, who was 48. They were nearing the end of a two-week vacation in Kenya when their small plane crashed en route to the capital city of Nairobi, killing the two passengers and the pilot. Their bodies were recovered three days after the crash, the cause of which is unknown.
Although a privileged socio-economic background allowed Rosenzweig to travel so extensively, her time spent abroad was usually unlike that of the average tourist.
One friend recalled a trip to Jamaica over spring break, during which Rosenzweig befriended a Rastafarian service worker and spoke with him for hours while her friends relaxed at the pool. She climbed Mount Kilimanjaro with a high school friend to raise money for a wildlife fund and Kenyan school.
Rosenzweig developed a close friendship with her roommate, Amy Lewis (COL ’13), and the two were companions at Georgetown and in many of Rosenzweig’stravels, including their semester abroad and a road trip to the West Coast after graduation.
“She was inspired by Kenya — the landscape, the people, the wildlife,” Lewis said. “Bess felt like the people were open, free, adventurous and non-judgmental. She wanted to live there eventually.”
Rosenzweig spoke several languages, including Swahili, which she studied for three semesters under Georgetown professor Vivian Lusweti. Lusweti said the language came naturally to Rosenzweig, who was known as dedicated and thoughtful in the classroom.
Her extensive time abroad was evident in her everyday life, often discreetly. She was known for wearing a pair of Converse sneakers with elaborate beading that she acquired in Kenya. In Calvert’s “Children and Technology” course, Rosenzweig remarked that she didn’t particularly miss technology while traveling in less developed parts of the world.
Friends described her as a free spirit, someone who found joy in simplicity and was passionate about learning for learning’s sake. Rosenzweig was not caught up in the frenzied job search, and although she considered moving to Cape Town or New York City, she did not have any definite career plans. Yet despite the absence of a specific professional ambition, friends noted Rosenzweig’s enthusiasm for the next chapter in her life.
“Georgetown is a hyperactive and achievement-oriented community,” said Sam Schneider (COL ’13), a friend of Rosenzweig’s and former member of The Hoya’s board of directors. “Bess valued a slow pace of life, caring more about spending time with people she loved and doing things she loved than grinding to reach some professional or academic goal that would advance her resume.”
Caley Beard, who became close friends with Rosenzweig in high school, recalled how much pleasure Rosenzweig took in simple things like her mother’s banana chocolate chip muffins. AlthoughRosenzweig enjoyed normal activities for someone her age, she could also engage in coversations for hours, whether with close friends or complete strangers.
“Her friends were her extended family,” said Anna Christiansen (COL ’13), who met Rosenzweig in 2009. “Her tremendous ability to read and understand people was reflected by how many on campus loved her.”
A memorial service for Rosenzweig is scheduled for Sept. 28 at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge.

The Georgetown University Law Center received criticism for its Loan Repayment Assistance Program earlier this month.
Because the Law Center’s LRAP is funded with federal dollars, the university charges higher rates for tuition than is necessary, the Federal Education Budget Project at the New America Foundation Director Jason Delisle and program associate Alex Holt alleged in a post on the NAFwebsite.
Currently, graduates who work for 10 years for the government, a nonprofit or in public service and make no more than $75,000 a year can have their loan repayments reimbursed by the university. Because of the 2007 Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, any Grad PLUS loans remaining after that 10-year period are forgiven, so students who qualify for both programs and go into public service will receive a free education.
In 2011, Law Center Assistant Dean for Financial Aid Charles Pruett and Delaney Family professor of public interest law Philip Schrag said that a program such as Georgetown’s LRAP that is also tied to Public Service Loan Forgiveness can help increase donations to the school. It also allows students to pursue work in public service instead of choosing the private sector to repay debt.
But according to NAF, there is no cap on the amount of Grad PLUS loans that students can take out or on the amount of money that can be forgiven. As a result, the university is increasing tuition and using the money from federally funded student loans to pay for LRAP — in effect, paying the government back with taxpayer dollars.
“We’re not saying Georgetown is doing something illegal, and I’m not arguing it’s immoral — I think Georgetown is taking advantage of a program that has all the wrong incentives,” Holt told The Hoya.
However, in an Aug. 21 piece in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Law Center Dean William Treanorsaid that Georgetown was not circumventing the law.
“Our decision to provide loan assistance beyond what the federal program offers is not a ‘loophole’ in the federal program; it is a supplement to public support for our graduates who serve the public,”Treanor wrote.
Instead, Treanor argued that LRAP is funded primarily through alumni donations and by students who do not qualify for the program.
“In short, 90 percent of Georgetown Law students do not benefit from the program,” Treanor wrote. “Through their loan repayments, these graduates — not the federal government — are supporting our Loan Repayment Assistance Program.”
Although Treanor wrote that LRAP barely factors into the Law Center’s budget, Holt said Treanor’sresponse did not justify the increasingly higher tuition at Georgetown Law and other law schools across the country.
“The problem with this particular thing we’ve uncovered, it’s complicated and it’s easy to confuse people with public service, but at the end of the day, it allows Georgetown to continue increasing tuition without questioning whether it’s valued at that,” Holt said.
According to Holt, the problem of unaffordable tuition is systemic.
“We picked Georgetown because they were so open about what they were doing, but they’re definitely not the only ones doing it,” Holt said, citing similar programs at the University of California at Berkeley, Duke University and New York University.
Holt disputed Treanor’s claim that Law Center is committed to helping graduates who go into public service.
“My question would be, does [Treanor] really think that $160,000 in loan forgiveness is a reasonable number for the government to forgive?” Holt said. “I don’t think Georgetown is quite as fully in the public interest as they say. They like to mention their Jesuit-inspired mission, but that’s $160,000 their students are borrowing.”
Georgetown Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming said he was unfamiliar with the program and declined to comment further.
Correction: Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly identified Georgetown Law professor Philip Schrag as the Law Center’s assistant dean of financial aid. The assistant dean of financial aid is Charles Pruett.

After losing his spot as the next mascot, Jack Jr. has found a home with a family close to Georgetown’s campus.
J.J. went to his new home August 18 to test the environment and ended up staying after the visit was successful.
“It worked so well I decided it was best for him to stay there,” said Fr. Christopher Steck, S.J., who cared for J.J. and mascot Jack in New South.
While Steck was not consulted about the decision to send J.J. away from campus, he was responsible for finding a new home for the dog.Steck declined to comment further on the search process.
Steck received more than 100 requests for J.J. after announcing he would begin the search process on Twitter. He visited 15 homes that met “ideals, not requirements” that he had posted online and narrowed them down to five top choices.
His requirements included that the family had experience raising “disciplined, well-behaved dogs,” lived locally in order for Steck to visit and help J.J. get used to his new surroundings, had multiple adults living at home and one adult who would be at home regularly and had no dogs that would not live well with J.J. He said the house should have a fenced-in backyard and provide a stable environment, and that children would require discussion.
The university’s decision to remove J.J., influenced by a settlement with parents whose child was bitten by J.J. last fall and an evaluation of the dog by experts without emotional attachment, prompted backlash from students and alumni who objected to its unilateral nature. No students were consulted in the decision, and Steck authored a viewpoint in The Hoya calling for transparency moving forward with the mascot tradition.
Students were not involved in the search for J.J.’s new home, but Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh said that student dog-walkers from the Jack Crew would have the opportunity to say goodbye.
“I think J.J. would be most comfortable with somebody who’d always be ready to play with him. I think we provided that at Georgetown, but I can also see how a backyard and the ability to run around would be great. He’s a very adaptable dog,” said Georgetown University Student Association Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS’14), who is a member of the Jack Crew and the newly formed Bulldog Advisory Committee.
“I trust Fr. Steck’s judgment 100 percent,” saidNeve Schadler (COL ’15), head of the Jack Crew.
The university said it planned to continue the live mascot tradition when it announced its decision after The Hoya broke the news in late July, but no public progress has been made regarding the search for a new mascot.
“We’ve been really focused on trying to make sure that we get J.J. into the best home, and now that that process is coming to a close, I think we can start to focus on pursuing some opportunities to bring another mascot here to campus,” Pugh said. “J.J. came here in a fairly confidential process between a bulldog breeder and the caretaker and the university, and I don’t know how it will transpire that we bring another dog to campus, but that’s what happened last time. … I think we’ll look for the right dog and the right opportunity presenting itself will dictate the timeline.”
Jack, who retired as mascot in March, remains on campus with Steck.

Georgetown University’s partner firm in master planning, Forest City Washington, is on the short list for redevelopment of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.
Mayor Vincent Gray will choose a developer for the 67-acre tract of land, located in the District’s Ward 4 near the Maryland border, that the District is expected to receive from the Army for redevelopment, though some of the land will be occupied by the State Department. The location has been vacant since Walter Reed closed in 2011.
Georgetown announced its partnership with Forest City on this project in a campus-wide email July 12. Since then, Forest City has presented to D.C. officials, as did other finalists under consideration. Georgetown’s campus at the site would include graduate programs and research facilities, as well as the possibility of collaboration with other institutions, though the exact nature of its programming is still unclear.
The Forest City team’s plan contains four interconnected neighborhood districts and related open space, which will surround a central area. This core would include Georgetown’s innovation center, restaurants, retail shops and a park.
Retailers including Wegmans, Whole Foods and Harris Teeter have been suggested by Forest City developers as possibilities for the space.
The three finalists — Forest City, Roadside Development and Hines-Urban Atlantic-Triden — launched project websites in early August, each detailing specific visions for the area. The three proposals all meet the project team’s requirements that the plans integrate the site with the community through public benefits, provide a variety of possibilities for use by the community, create jobs and revenue for the District and minimize vacancies on the site.
“We are actively engaged in master planning and therefore don’t yet know exactly what programs we would locate off of our current campus,” university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr said. “We’re still in the middle of the [process], which includes evaluating what makes most sense on the main campus, what would make more sense to have in another part of the city. We envision a sort of innovation hub that could really look at partnerships in new ways.”
Roadside’s plan proposes four distinct neighborhoods with an institutional core, like the proposal presented by Forest City. The Roadside proposal, however, specifies two residential areas, a town center and a park, as well as partnerships with Wegmans and the Children’s National Medical Center.
Wegmans, which will be located in the town center area, would pull shoppers from surrounding communities to create new retail opportunities. Roadside co-founder Richard Lake told The Washington Post that if Roadside’s proposal is chosen, he could open Wegmans by 2017.
The Children’s National Medical Center would be located in the institutional core and include a caregiver and first responder museum, which would be dedicated to the memory of people who served at the former Walter Reed hospital.
Hines Urban Atlantic’s proposal, named The Park at Walter Reed, focused on parks and recreational space.
“Our mission is to re-introduce the community to Walter Reed,” Hines Senior Vice President Chuck Waters told The Washington Post.
The institutional core is anchored in the life and health sciences, with partnerships with The George Washington University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Biotrial, a contract research organization for drug development and clinical services. Hines Urban Atlantic also presented two plans for retail space, one for a large format retailer and the other for a smaller specialty grocer.
Comments on the proposals are open until Sept. 25.

A series of contentious decisions made by the university administration this summer have received criticism for excluding students from the deliberation process.
Plans for the Northeast Triangle residence hall were initially presented in what appeared to be a finished form to Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E and the Old Georgetown Board with minimal student or alumni input. A ban on cars for undergraduates that was a component of the 2010 Campus Plan agreement was implemented without any discussion with students in July. And Georgetown’s decision to remove former mascot-in-training Jack Jr. from campus was made without input from students, alumni or J.J.’s caretaker, Fr. Christopher Steck, S.J.
“This summer there were a few missteps,” Georgetown University Student Association President NateTisa (SFS ’14) said. “I think that the announcements that were made this summer demonstrated the importance of communicating with students often early on in the process.”
Administrators have since responded to criticism of an opaque, internal decision-making process at the university.
“On the parking policy, it would have been better to be more transparent and more active in communicating that earlier,” Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said about the vehicle ban. “I certainly take responsibility that it would have been ideal to publicize it more broadly earlier on.”
Regarding the new dormitory proposal, Olson added, “What we’ve all acknowledged since then is it certainly would have been ideal to have broader student discussions and publicity before [the presentation at the ANC meeting].”
Vice President for Facilities and Planning Robin Morey, who leads the university’s master planning and is a key player in the dorm design, directed all requests for comment to the Office of Communications.
“We tried to communicate as much information as we could as soon as we could,” Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh said.
Throughout the summer, students and faculty reacted to the unclear decision-making processes behind university announcements.
“If this is what the campus plan is going to be like for the next few years, that’s not good.” Tisa said to The Hoya about the vehicle ban in July.
After the decision to remove J.J. from campus, Steck authored an op-ed in The Hoya calling for a transparent process moving forward.
“The university is at its best when it is a place of candid and transparent dialogue,” Steck wrote. “If the mascot is to be an adequate symbol of Georgetown, decisions about him should reflect its rich,dialogical life.”
Criticism of Northeast Triangle prompted the university to hold forums for discussion of designs over the next few months, and Morey responded to backlash by emphasizing this commitment to dialogue.
“The recent criticism has made it clear to us that we need to redouble our efforts to communicate broadly and transparently regarding our planning work,” he wrote in July.
Some university decisions involved student representatives in GUSA and other bodies but were not communicated to the general student body. For example, GUSA leaders and student members of a design committee saw designs of Northeast Triangle before the ANC 2E meeting.
“I think it’s very appropriate for us to work with elected student leaders as sort of a key connecting point and also with them to reach out and provide opportunities to the overall student body,” Olson said.
GUSA is working with administrators to establish office hours, increase the number of Hoya Roundtables and establish more student forums to improve transparency this semester.
“We are working to get the university to a place where consulting with students is not viewed as something that happens in special situations but is just something that’s assumed because of its effectiveness,” Tisa said. “Talking to students makes every decision that much better.”
Tisa acknowledged that students need to stay involved over the summer because the administration works year-round.
“There is an understanding that when students aren’t here over the summer, they are less likely to be active, they are less likely to be aware of what’s going on and that’s why it’s so important and so crucial for students to be engaged and to stay engaged,” Tisa said.

The Department of Public Safety followed through this summer on a promise to improve campus security made in response to heightened threats after last year’s bombing at the Boston Marathon.
Chief of Police Jay Gruber announced that there would be an increased number of officers on campus, among other security updates, in a campus-wide email April 19. This summer, improvements to campus security included updated closed-circuit TV cameras, the new EmergenSee segment of the Georgetown mobile app and behavior pattern recognition training for plainclothes officers, he said.
“The Boston Marathon bombings reminded us we’re not immune to terrorist acts. It really helped reinforce the fact we need to make enhancements to keep our community safer,” Gruber said. “It provided the impetus to get these projects moving forward.”
However, over the summer, the number of burglaries at Georgetown and in the surrounding neighborhood rose, with 10 burglaries of unlocked apartments and houses reported in August.
“We always have some level of crime in the community, but unfortunately the opportunity for that crime has spiked,” Gruber said. “Our student population over the summer hasn’t heeded warnings to keep their doors locked.”
Gruber said he expects the level of crime to subside as the regular student population returns to campus and advised all students to lock their doors.
Gruber was also confident that improvements to campus security would keep crime in check. DPS updated approximately 30 percent of closed-circuit TV cameras on campus over the summer, replacing cameras that were broken or had low picture quality.
The implementation of behavior pattern recognition training for plainclothes officers from the DPS Community Action Team would be applicable to both criminals and terrorists, Gruber said.
“It takes profiling out of the picture, because you’re looking at behaviors, not people,” Gruber said. “Behaviors of people who are potential terrorists are also seen in criminals.”
The partnership with EmergenSee emerged as an alternative to updating the blue light phone system on campus, a system Gruber said seemed outdated. Gruber reached out to the company, whose app is used by universities, high schools and businesses around the country, to adapt the program for Georgetown. The app uses Wi-Fi and GPS signals to live stream audio and video to DPS officers when activated in an emergency situation within the designated perimeter of Burleith, Foxhall and West Georgetown established by geo-fence technology.
Students can download EmergenSee through a link on the Georgetown mobile app. In addition to reporting emergencies back to DPS, students can add a contact who will also be notified in the case of an emergency. EmergenSee automatically calls DPS when launched unless the auto-start incident setting is turned off.
DPS beta tested the app throughout the spring semester and summer before its launch this fall. No students have used the app to report an emergency yet.
“The beta test went well. We found little things the company needed to do to enhance the product. Now, we have a product we feel comfortable with going forward,” Gruber said.
Gruber said DPS was able to pursue all security updates it had planned this summer.
“Enhancements to the video system and EmergenSee were big pushes for us to get moving before the academic semester,” he said.
Another minor change for the semester is an online lost-and-found system, replacing the former method that required students to fill out a card in the DPS office to inquire about lost items.

The School of Continuing Studies officially moved to its new downtown location August 20 in time for the start of the fall semester.
“The opening so far has been going pretty well,” SCS Interim Dean Walter Rankin said. “Given that we moved everybody from two campuses, we managed it in three days’ time.”
Although classes start Wednesday, the building’s renovation work is still incomplete. The construction company prioritized classrooms and office space so that the building could open for the fall semester. Throughout the next few months, work will continue on the cafe and auditorium. Some AV equipment and screens need to be adjusted and installed, which Rankin said should be completed within the next few weeks.
The new space at 640 Massachusetts Ave. NW contains faculty-only areas, such as a faculty lounge and a work lounge, which the previous campuses on M Street and in Clarendon, Va., lacked. There are also breakout rooms that can be used for one-on-one meetings with students.
“So far, the faculty reaction has been really great,” Rankin said. “I think some faculty were a little nervous at first, but it’s really very accessible and many of our faculty work downtown, so for many it makes the commute shorter.”
Rankin said that student reaction has been positive so far.
“We were completely prepared that some people might not know what to make of the transition, but the excitement level is extremely high,” Rankin said. “Nobody has withdrawn from any of the programs because of the [new] location. We’re on track for our largest fall enrollment ever.”
To celebrate the official opening of the building, SCS organized a service event Saturday, engaging with the local neighborhood through the Central Union Mission and the Asian and Pacific Islander Senior Center. This was the first time the SCS had organized a service event, and roughly 45 students participated, along with SCS faculty and staff.
“We’re excited because we want to keep doing these activities to build strong relationships with the neighborhood,” Rankin said. “[The proximity] will get us a chance to do this on a regular basis. We’re looking forward to expanding this image of Georgetown downtown … really to help the community and engage people.”
The university is applying for Gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design status for the building, the second-highest certification granted by the U.S. Green Building Council.
Rankin expressed confidence in the building’s certification, citing its proximity to all major metro lines and Circulator bus lines as a factor, along with its water-efficient plumbing and power-efficient LED fixtures.
During construction, the builders also used non volatile organic compounds, and the furniture in the new building has very low organic compound content. Many of the materials used were also recyclable and regional.
The university should receive notice about the certification by the end of the year.
