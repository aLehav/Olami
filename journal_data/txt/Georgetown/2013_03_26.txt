A man suspected of stealing a Corp employee’s iPad and a female suspected of being his accomplice were arrested outside of Vital Vittles around 7 p.m. Monday night.
An employee of the convenience store saw the two individuals and matched the male’s image with that of a man who had taken an iPad from the store’s office March 17 at around 11 p.m.
According to Students of Georgetown, Inc. CEO Lizzy MacGill (COL ’14), the two suspects entered the store Monday around 6:50 p.m.
“[The male] arrived in the back office and looked in the back office area and saw that there were people back there and then turned around,” MacGill said.
The store employees contacted Corp Chief Operating Officer Rashaad Eshack (SFS ’14) and then called the Department of Public Safety. DPS arrived at the scene and arrested the suspects.
Eshack said that the entire process took only minutes because DPS officers are on patrol throughout campus.
The male perpetrator did not steal any merchandise when he was in the store last night.
“I don’t think he really had a chance [to steal anything] because there weren’t really any areas that were neglected, and the employees were really alert, which I think is one of the reasons he was identified and one of the reasons he was caught,” MacGill said.
MacGill said that employees were able to identify the two suspects because images from security cameras that had captured footage of the pair were disseminated among staff members.
“We’re doing well in communication, and we’re being very vigilant, which will help us stay safe in the future,” MacGill said.
Neither MacGill nor Eshack could provide further details on the description of the either individual, andDPS Chief of Police Jay Gruber, the only member of the force authorized to provide commentary to the media, could not be reached by press time.

Professors at Georgetown who also call the university their alma mater are relatively rare. But for the alumni who do go on to become part of the Hilltop’s faculty, Georgetown provides a home for the natural progression from student to teacher, despite the sometimes overwhelming changes the campus has undergone since they were freshmen.
For many alumni professors, soaking up Georgetown’s values and intellectual atmosphere for several years has been the foundation to their own approaches to teaching.
Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., (CAS ’88)said that his Jesuit mentors in particular influenced his teaching.
“Walking the halls and the lawns at my alma mater, I am reminded of the professors, Jesuits and other mentors who were so important to me as an undergrad,” O’Brien said. “The lessons that they taught me I hear echoed in the counsel that I give to students today.”
Ron Klain (CAS ’83), who teaches a government department seminar for graduating seniors based on his political experience as chief of staff to vice presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore, has also found that his Hilltop experience can help him make his teaching more relevant for students as they transition into careers.
“We talk about [my Georgetown experience], and I think students appreciate it,” Klain said. “Second semester seniors are thinking about what comes next in terms of their [careers]. They appreciate that I was once in their shoes and have the same perspective they have now.”
Klain added that the course he teaches today is markedly different from the kinds of courses he took in the 1980s.
“I have teaching tools my professors didn’t have,” he said. “I can assign videos of presidential debates all on the Internet, I can pull materials from a wide range of things on the Web and I can update the material.”
Sam Potolicchio (COL ’04, GRD ’11), who teaches for the Semester in Washington program at Georgetown, said that his more recent experience as a Georgetown student positions him especially well to provide pertinent insights to his students.
“I was just recently in the classrooms as an undergraduate, and it gives me a perspective of what the students are facing and how they are learning,” Potolicchio said. “Being so young and also being a student myself just a couple of years ago — I think that gives me a unique perspective.”
Making Sense of Change
While professors’ experiences as Georgetown students can help inform their teaching, they are quick to acknowledge that the university has changed dramatically since their days as students — and the mentalities of students along with it.
When adjunct professor of psychology Frank Warman (C ’65) attended Georgetown, the school was all-male, all-white and almost entirely Catholic. Students wore coats and ties to class. Though Warman freely shares his Georgetown experiences with his psychology classes, he said that he sees his students as members of a distinct generation.
“I’m very aware they grew up in a totally different world than I grew up in,” Warman said.
English professor John Glavin (C ’64) remembers this same version of Georgetown less fondly.
“I didn’t like Georgetown at all as an undergraduate,” Glavin said. “It was a homogenous, all-male and almost entirely Catholic school. I found that identity was very constricting if you weren’t necessarily part of that world. … It was a small, narrow place, and I felt very constrained by that.”
When Russian professor Marcia Morris (FLL ’74, GRD ’77) arrived on campus in the fall of 1970, it was only the second year women were admitted to the university. Female students had a 12 a.m. weeknight curfew and a 2 a.m. weekend curfew, while male students had no restrictions.
“In actual living conditions, there was certainly a difference in terms of how [women] were treated in class. There were individual faculty members who had dress codes and said ‘Women will wear skirts in my class,’” Morris said.
Though the university has evolved to include women in the classroom and students of more races and faiths, some aspects have remained the same since the early 1960s, and not all change has been positive.
“Students are very well-trained in writing, but need a broader framework, more curiosity toward the world,” Maurice Jackson (GRD ’95, ’01), a history and African-American studies professor, said. “Students are smarter, but not necessarily brighter.”
Glavin added that students of today face heightened pressures and stresses that did not exist during his time as a student.
“I came to Georgetown during a time of remarkable prosperity and job security,” Glavin said. “The thing that strikes me most about my students in the past decade is how anxious they are and how insecure the future seems to them.”
McDonough School of Business professor Susan Dugan (FLL ’77) disagreed.
“I think there is a greater level of self-assurance on the part of students that was probably not the case 30 years ago,” Dugan said. “Georgetown University was a sleepier, smaller school. It was still exclusive and it still had a cache, but it was not quite as in the spotlight as it is now.”
Warman and Glavin diverged on the question of whether Georgetown’s campus is more politically active than it was during their time as students.
Glavinrecalled one of the most difficult episodes of his undergraduate studies when, as editor-in-chief of The Hoya, he published an article criticizing the marked absence of students from Catholic universities in the civil rights movement.
“I said that this claim that the national press had been making was basically true. Because places like Georgetown at the time were still highly complacent when it came to these issues,” Glavin said. “The huge amount of time and energy that students put into social justice is completely different than [it was] when I was a student. That’s one of the most remarkable changes.”
On the other hand, Warman said that this interest in social justice is muted in comparison to the political activism that he remembers pervading campus in the 1960s.
“The school seems less political now than it was when I was here. You don’t see students protesting or occupying buildings,” he said.  “Maybe the reason for that is that there isn’t a draft — students in the ’60s were worried about going to Vietnam.”
Unsurprisingly, these changes are less dramatic for those professors who finished their studies at Georgetown more recently
From the perspective of recent graduate Mark Lagon(GRD ’91), a visiting professor in the Master of Science in Foreign Service program, the traditions he enjoyed as a student appear to burn strong today.
“I lived at the Tombs,” Lagon said. “Today, I walk by the booth where the groomsmen from my wedding ate dinner two nights before my wedding, and the great thing is how much the Tombs is the same just as everything around here has grown.”
Big Transitions, Big Challenges
Despite the advantages that being a Georgetown alumnus or alumna can provide to a newly minted professor, there is no denying that the shift from student to teacher — even on the same turf — involves distinct trials.
“The biggest transition for me was going from student to teacher,” Jackson said. “Some of the faculty think you don’t belong — 90 percent do, but some don’t.”
For O’Brien, the transition from student to professor included one from layperson to Jesuit.
“When I graduated from Georgetown in 1988, I could not have imagined returning 20 years later as a Jesuit priest,” O’Brien said. “God is full of surprises.”
For many, however, the transition to teaching is eased by the presence of many familiar faces, including professors under whom they studied while at Georgetown.
Lagon met his wife in a political philosophy class with Fr. James Schall, S.J.
“He read the gospel at [our] wedding,” Lagon said.
Even for those who did not meet their spouses in the classroom, the student-professor connection still runs deep.
“I still see some of my professors here, which is fun, and definitely gives you that sense of continuity and sort of the sense that this is going to go on forever,” Dugan said.
And for all the changes to the university, some professors felt like they had never left when they returned in their new teaching capacities.
“I feel like I’ve been there the entire time and so I feel like I’ve kind of grown with Georgetown,” Potolicchio said.
Government professor Anthony Arend (SFS ’80) characterized his Georgetown years succinctly and poignantly: “This is my home. This is my place.”

DreamCatchers, a national, student-run nonprofit that seeks to grant hospice patients’ wishes, launched a Georgetown chapter in February and will hold its first meeting after Easter.
“It sounds corny, but I love celebrating life, and I think [DreamCatchers] is a great opportunity to celebrate a generation,” Chapter Founder Katie Day (NHS ’15) said. “It’s a celebration of all that they’ve learned, and family’s involved, and I feel passionately about that.”
Day said that she decided to begin the club because she noticed a lack of hospice center outreach programs in the Center for Social Justice.
DreamCatchers member Sarah Hewitt (NHS ’15) agreed and said that DreamCatchers is unique in its target audience.
“I think the most noteworthy difference between DreamCatchers and other clubs on campus is the population we hope to serve,” Hewitt said. “To my knowledge, there is no other club on campus that works with hospice patients. … I think the elderly population tends to be forgotten in their last years of life.”
Georgetown DreamCatchers is partnering with the Washington Home and Community Hospices. The group chose this location based on its demonstrated level of need.
“I want to stick with one center and build a good relationship with them to start,” Day said. “We’ll do realistic goals, since we’re working with a limited amount of time.”
Day cited family reunions and new foods as examples of possible wishes.
Current Notre Dame sophomore Caitlin Crommett founded DreamCatchers while working at a hospice center when she was 15, and she continued growing the organization in college.
“I think one of the most important things I’ve learned is just listening to these people’s stories,” Crommett said. “What they have to say has made such a difference in my life.”
Last summer, Crommett and a team of DreamCatchers members travelled to Raleigh, N.C., Washington, D.C., Nashville, Tenn., Phoenix and Las Vegas in order to set up new chapters and gain recognition as a national foundation. According to Crommett, the group’s visit to D.C. had revealed strong interest in the organization.
Lucy Gibson (COL ’15), a member of the Georgetown chapter, said that she looked forward to helping hospice patients.
“I am interested in DreamCatchers because the elderly have given so much to us. Culturally, I worry we take that for granted.” Gibson said. “There have been certain moments in college that propel you out of your life-vantage. I expect this club to be a consistent, somewhat jarring, reminder of not just life outside the Georgetown bubble but the nature of life itself.”
Hewitt cited her personal experiences with hospice care as her reason for joining the organization.
“While I can’t be there with my grandparents, who live across the country, through DreamCatchers, I can do my part to serve those who find themselves in similar situations right here in the D.C. area,” Hewitt wrote.

Service Employees International Union Local 500, which serves adjunct professors at American University and The George Washington University, filed a motion to vote to represent adjunct faculty at Georgetown last Friday, bringing adjuncts here one step closer to unionization.
In a meeting held March 21, union representatives announced that at least 30 percent of Georgetown adjunct professors had signed union authorization cards, which is the minimum proportion required by law for SEIU Local 500 to file a motion to vote with the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency that oversees unions.
After filing the motion, the NLRB will send out secret ballots by mail in mid-April to eligible adjunct faculty members that have taught credit-earning courses this academic year. However, adjuncts working outside of the District, at the Georgetown University Law Center or the Georgetown University Medical Center, which includes those in the School of Medicine and the School of Nursing & Health Studies, will not be able to vote, according to a message sent by Provost Robert Groves to university faculty.
If over 50 percent of those who vote approve the measure to have SEIU Local 500 represent them, the adjuncts will be unionized.
The Georgetown Solidarity Committee, a student group centered on fair employment practices, organized a unionization event for the adjuncts last Thursday.
“It’s mostly showing the adjuncts that we as students support them and we as students support their unionization, and kind of just making sure that people realize [that] this is going to benefit the entire community, not just adjuncts,” Sydney Browning (COL ’15), a GSC member, said.
Anne McLeer, director of research and strategic planning for SEIU Local 500, believes union representation will lead to better job security and benefits for the adjunct professors.
“People should be paid the same wage for the same work,” McLeer, who spoke at the event, said. “This erosion of the middle class and casualization of the professions, that’s what’s going on in higher education.”
According to McLeer, over 50 percent of professors in higher education are part-time and another 25 percent are contingent, meaning they were hired on a non-tenure track.
And this figure has been on the rise in recent years, including at Georgetown. There are about 200 adjunct faculty members at Georgetown, a figure that is almost double that of a decade ago, according to Wayne Davis, chair of the faculty senate.
Adjunct faculty constitutes part-time instructors who are contracted for a semester on a class-by-class basis, without the research or duty requirements of tenure-track or tenured professors. Most adjunct faculty hold master’s degrees, as opposed to their non-adjunct counterparts who typically hold doctorates.
The average adjunct makes $21,000 a year, without benefits, according to Maria Maisto (SFS ’89,GRD ’92), who spoke at Thursday’s meeting.
Maisto, an English adjunct at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland, Ohio, and president of New Faculty Majority, an adjunct advocacy group, argued that the treatment of adjuncts affected the entire university environment.
“Students suffer when faculty do not have good working conditions,” Maisto said. “Our conditions are your conditions. … I sometimes joke to my students that they should go ask ‘Where’s my adjunct tuition rate?’”
Pablo Eisenberg, a 13-year senior fellow adjunct at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute, reflected on how attitudes toward adjuncts differed between students and tenured faculty.
While student groups fought for living wage policies at Georgetown — which is the only such policy in the country — to support employees such as adjuncts, tenured professors, on the other hand, often look down on their adjunct colleagues, according to Eisenberg.
“You had an elitist approach on the part of tenured faculty,” Eisenberg said. “Somehow, by virtue of their Ph.D.s, they were special people. … Adjuncts are the untouchables.”
In addition to salary, adjunct professors face a different career outlook. For some adjuncts, teaching is a second job in addition to their primary one. Other adjuncts teach after retirement from their career.
Not all adjunct professors share the sentiment that they are mistreated by the university, however.
For Frank Warman, an adjunct in the psychology department, adjunct teaching positions should be designed for those who have successful careers and benefits elsewhere. While Warman does not oppose the movement, he said that he has not been roused to join it, either.
“I’ve always thought of adjunct teaching as being more the thing you do that’s not your day job — you take care of those needs by doing something else,” he said. “I didn’t get agitated about adjunct issues. It’s probably for younger people who have to hold on to three or four jobs to make a living. … I’ve told people I actually would work here for free. The rewards of working here have exceeded my expectations.”
Browning believes, however, that the views of professors like Warman cannot be applied to all adjunct professors.
“The money they make from being a professor here is nothing to them because they are already making a large income,” Browning said. They don’t understand why [unionization] is important.”
GSC has advocated for living wage rights in the past, with a 10-day hunger strike that resulted in the university raising workers’ wages and granting them the right to organize. The committee was also instrumental in helping workers atO’Donovan Dining Hall unionize with UNITE HERE, a national food service labor group, in 2011, and has supported them in protests against their employer, Aramark.
“I think Georgetown is terrified of another public fight,” McLeer said.
But so far, in contrast to the initial reactions of GWU and American when their adjunct professors first announced their intent to unionize, Georgetown has pledged neutrality and neither plans to contest the adjuncts’ right to unionize nor interfere with the vote.
In a message to the main campus faculty, Provost Robert Groves wrote that he expects the deadline to submit ballots to be late April or early May but that the NLRB has not yet said when it will count the ballots. He reiterated that Georgetown does not oppose the unionization process.
“As stated in Georgetown’s Just Employment Policy, the university respects employees’ rights to freely associate and organize, which includes voting for or against union representation without intimidation, unjust pressure, undue delay or hindrance in accordance with applicable law,” Groves wrote.
Browning invoked Georgetown’s Catholic values as a strong justification for improved treatment of adjunct professors.
“Several of our other workers on campus are unionized, so it doesn’t make sense that our adjuncts aren’t unionized,” Browning said. “We’re a Catholic school, and Catholic schools should be devoted to social justice and the dignity of labor, and that includes professors having a collective voice in advocating for themselves.”
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that 50 percent of eligible voters had to vote in favor of unionization for SEIU Local 500 to represent the adjunct faculty at Georgetown. The article has been corrected to reflect that adjuncts will be unionized if the majority of those who vote approve the measure.

Georgetown’s expenditure on lobbying Congress has dropped sharply over the last decade, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a research firm that collects information from the Senate Office of Public Records.
Between 2001 and 2012, the years for which data are available on the firm’s website, university lobbying costs hovered around $200,000 annually in the early 2000s, peaked at $380,000 in 2007 and reached an 11-year low of $40,000 in 2012.
Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming said that the decline in spending has not been prompted by concerns about funding constraints and that the university continues to actively lobby in support of a variety of programs and initiatives.
“Our lobbying activities vary from year to year depending on what issues are priorities at a particular time. As a result, there are fluctuations in the amounts of lobbying, even from quarter to quarter,” Fleming said.
The ups and downs in the university’s yearly lobbying spending are driven by events in Congress, according to Fleming. Georgetown’s spending most often increases when lawmakers take up issues related to national education funding.
“Last week I spent an entire five days on Capitol Hill having arranged meetings about the Scholarships for Education and Economic Development program,” Fleming said. “Georgetown has managed it for years, and because of this, there is some revenue gain to the university.”
According to Fleming, the large spike in lobbying spending in 2007 is mostly explained by Congress’ decision to reauthorize the Higher Education Act of 1965. The reauthorization took an extensive amount of work on the part of university lobbyists from across the country, whose employers have an interest in acquiring educational grants.
Chantal Santelices, director of the Center for Intercultural Education and Development, said that her organization has benefitted from Fleming’s efforts to secure funding from the HEA and other pieces of federal legislation.
“Fleming has been instrumental in reaching out to Congress and government agencies to inform them of CIED’s and Georgetown University’s mission, capabilities and accomplishments,” she said. “He is an invaluable resource for the university to understand opportunities and challenges in work and research funded by the U.S. government.”
According to Fleming, funding from the HEA is critical to the work done at many programs at Georgetown besides CIED. Other major recipients of federal funding include the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies; the National Resource Center on the Middle East and North Africa; and the National Resource Center on East Asia.
Another factor behind the rise in lobbying spending during 2007, Fleming said, was the time and work he devoted to helping the Georgetown varsity crew team acquire the necessary permits to construct a new boathouse on the Potomac River.
Fleming added that the university’s expenditure on lobbying as represented in the federal government’s records reflect quarterly rounding of expenditures.
“For instance, in a number of quarters, we’ve spent maybe $6,000, but we have to count it as $10,000,” he explained.
Fleming added that Georgetown is frugal in its lobbying expenditures relative to other private universities. According to The GW Hatchet, Boston University spent about $1.5 million lobbying Congress last year. However, The Hatchet also reported that The George Washington University’s expenditures on federal lobbying had been eliminated since 2007 following a series of deep budget cuts.
What concern Fleming most about Georgetown’s financial relationship with Congress are the automatic budget cuts commonly referred to as the sequester and the possibility of future cuts to discretionary domestic spending.
Fleming also said that there seems to be a surge in momentum on Capitol Hill toward the passing of immigration reform and indicated that Georgetown will continue to be involved in the deliberation process. University President John J. DeGioia has signed several letters in recent months advocating immigration reform, according to Fleming.
“President DeGioia has a long history of supporting highly educated immigrants,” Fleming said.
Zack Zappone (COL ’13), who plans to work for federally funded Teach for America this fall, said that he thought Georgetown’s financial relationship with Congress was appropriate.
“I think it’s the role of the federal government to support the advancement of education and higher education,” Zappone said. “So I think it’s appropriate and good for Georgetown to secure funding from the federal government.”
Fleming agreed with Zappone’s notion that the federal government has an obligation to financially support institutions like Georgetown and said that he considers it his central goal to help Georgetown students acquire resources and connections in whatever way he can.
“I wake up and say to myself that everything I should do should be to help Georgetown students,” Fleming said. “I like to think that every issue that I work on is important to our students. Whether it’s direct lobbying to improve the quality of education or working with students in program activities or connecting them with people that could set them on a future career path, that’s all part and parcel of what my job is all about.”

The Georgetown University Student Association Senate unanimously passed a bill on March 17 urging the university to encourage more professors to use Blackboard’s Gradebook feature, which allows students to see grades for individual assignments and their overall performance in a course.
The original bill that GUSA Chair for Student Life Ben Weiss (COL ’15) proposed had called for more comprehensive reform to Blackboard usage, but GUSA Speaker and former GUSA Chair of Intellectual Life George Spyropoulos (COL ’14) said that he narrowed the focus of the bill to increase its likelihood of getting passed efficiently.
“I believed [it] would be too ambitious a project,” Spyropoulos said. “I decided to narrow it down to focus on a specific part of Blackboard, Gradebook … which is a change that wouldn’t cost a lot.”
Spyropoulos said that GUSA believes the university should view this initiative as the next step in the university’s push to catch up with technological progress, which has been marked in recent months by an upgrade to its WiFi infrastructure and investment in massive open online courses, which will see some Georgetown courses broadcast on the edX platform worldwide.
While there are no statistics available about current Blackboard usage, Spyropoulos said the bill would enhance student-professor communication by raising students’ awareness about their academic progress.
“A lot of students would appreciate having the knowledge [of their grades] … because another problem that a lot of students have told me that they are facing is that there are sometimes big delays in terms of hearing back [from professors],” Spyropoulos said.
But, benefits of the proposal apply only to professors who either currently use Blackboard or do not use any form of online grade book.
Some professors have criticized the utility of the Blackboard software and have crafted their own solutions to this problem.
“I understand that students want to see their progress in a timely fashion, but there are many more efficient ways of facilitating that rather than Blackboard,” economics professor Arik Levinson, who uses the economics learning website Aplia to distribute homework and a personal website to post grades, said.
Levinson cited difficulty uploading grades, the inability to merge class sections or to re-grade homework and the site’s overall slowness as Blackboard’s chief inefficiencies.
“What I do already is in the spirit of what students want, which is at every point during the semester that students have turned in an assignment, they can go online and see their score along with all prior assignments from that semester,” Levinson said. “It would be as though GUSA is requiring me to use a crummy technology when, in fact, I am using a better technology.”
While Spyropoulos acknowledged Blackboard’s imperfections, he emphasized the benefits of consolidating classroom materials into one accessible source across different courses.
“I actually don’t believe that Blackboard is a very high-tech website,” Spyropoulos said. “On the other hand, I do believe that it is actually a more efficient system than handing midterms back in class, and there is no privacy issue.”
Leia Alex (SFS ’16) took Levinson’s class in the fall.
“This semester, all of [my professors] do use Blackboard … and I think it’s easier to just check on your classes all in one site,” Alex said. “I would like it if they put more grades on Blackboard because, as of right now, it’s hard to track your progress, especially since different sections of your grade are weighted differently.”
Spyropoulos said that he hoped to begin conversations with the university in the upcoming weeks and to implement the reform as early as next semester.
“We’re going to talk to the administration and ask that they encourage professors or even require them [to use Blackboard],” Spyropoulos said. “It’s up to them what they want to do, but we just bring the idea to the table.”
Spyropoulos anticipated that if the bill were successful, increased usage of Gradebook would be a stepping stone to an overall increase in Blackboard usage.
“I think that just getting professors to use [Blackboard] for Gradebook will eventually bring professors to use it for other reasons as well because if you haven’t had a Blackboard account, perhaps you haven’t had the advantages of having all of your readings up there, and you might try to consider that.” Sypropoulos said. “We’re not trying to be the bad guys here; we’re just trying to implement a change that we believe students will enjoy.”

The Georgetown University Student Association Senate voted unanimously to approve President NateTisa (SFS ’14) and Vice President Adam Ramadan’s (SFS ’14) nominations for a new executive cabinet Sunday.
Tisa said his cabinet structure will mirror the subcommittee structure he introduced to the senate during his term as senate speaker this past year when Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) was president and Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) was vice-president.
“There will be more division and specialization, with the undersecretaries working on specific projects and initiatives,” he said.
Tisa also said the executive plans to release a 40-day plan after Easter Break that will outline the goals of each cabinet member for the remainder of this academic year.
“With Clara and Vail, they did a lot in the fall. They had the referendum, but imagine if we had done that in the spring. It just completely increases what we’re able to do,” Tisa said. “We’re trying to get the cabinet active and make sure each position has a tangible goal for the next month.”
Tisa and Ramadan kept all the positions from their predecessors’ cabinet and created two new positions: secretary of D.C. relations and secretary of the arts.
“The position for D.C. relations was created to improve students’ ability to advocate for ourselves out in the city,” Tisa said.
“[The position of secretary of the arts] was created to address the pressing needs of the arts community regarding to space as well as improving its profile on campus,” Tisa said.
George Smith (COL ’14) will be secretary of D.C. relations and Chase Meacham (COL ’14) secretary of the arts.
Meacham said he expects his biggest challenge will be the loss of student space for the arts during construction of the Healey Family Student Center.
“For an artist or an art group to excel on campus, it needs … space, resources, personnel, publicity and a positive atmosphere,” Meacham said. “My top two priorities would be finding space for artistic groups and ways for individual artists to prosper on campus.”
Ben Manzione (SFS ’15) and Michelle Mohr (COL ’15) will serve as co-directors of the Student Advocacy Office during Tisa and Ramadan’s term.
“One thing we’re really looking to push for this year is education of students’ rights. One of the biggest things with our administration on campus is that a lot of students don’t know they have the right to say no to or the right to say yes to and how they would appeal on cases and things along those lines,” Mohr said.
Manizone said he would prioritize working with Gustafson and former SAO Co-Director Sam Schneider (COL ’13), the latter a former opinion editor and member of The Hoya’s board of directors, to raise the burden of proof for Code of Student Conduct violations from “more likely than not” to “clear and convincing” for off-campus incidents.
According to Secretary of Academic Affairs Guy Mentel (COL’14), a former staff writer for The Hoya, codifying grading policies, making grades accessible on Blackboard and institutionalizing professors’ office hours schedules will be the focus of his time in office.
“There is a huge divide between the student body and the faculty. I think we’re wasting really big resources by not having a cooperative relationship between those two bodies,” he said.
Secretary of Neighborhood Relations Pieter Fossel (SFS ’14) predicted that the 2010 Campus Plan will remain a significant priority for his position.
“A lot has happened between with the neighborhood relations in the last two years, and I’d like to build off that momentum to work with neighborhood and the administration to make sure we’re advocating for student rights,” Fossel said. ”I also would like to play up the ways in which Georgetown and the students benefit the neighborhood and get them more aware of the performances in arts and different things students do on campus.”
Secretary of Mission and Ministry Arienne Calingo (COL’14), when asked by GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee Chair Sheila Walsh (SFS ’14) about how she plans to address Campus Ministry’s ongoing attempt to form an advisory board, did not produce a direct and substantive reply.
“I know that Campus Ministry now has one interfaith retreat, but I feel like they should host at least one or two each semester. That’s one of my goals,” Calingo said in response.
Secretary of Athletic Affairs Rachael Augostini (COL’14), a staff writer for The Hoya and a board member of Hoya Blue, said her frequent interactions with the athletics department will serve as a strong asset for communicating with student-athletes. Augostini identified instituting an athletic training program for club sports — an initiative Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount highlighted in their campaign but did not complete — as her main priority.
“I think if they want trainers, they should be able to have them. They’re athletes on campus so they should get a lot of resources they need,” she said.
The senate also approved appointment of Minjung Kang (SFS ’15) as secretary of diversity affairs, Brittney Blakely (COL ’14) as secretary of social justice, Gabe Pincus (SFS ’14) in a second term as secretary of sustainability, Nora West (SFS ’15) as secretary of student safety and health and David Weis (COL ’14) in his second term as secretary of alumni and career services.

Two drug stores on Connecticut Avenue may be prevented from receiving liquor licenses due to the contested definition of a full service grocery store under Washington, D.C. law.
The CVS Pharmacy at 2601 Connecticut Ave. NW and the Walgreens at 4225 Connecticut Ave. NW are both awaiting approval for a Class B alcohol licenses, which only permit the sale of beer and wine.
A stipulation in local law, however, places a moratorium on the issuance of these licenses in five zones in the city in order to increase economic development. But the moratorium, which was instituted in Glover Park in 2008, includes an exception for full-service grocery stores.
The Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration held a hearing Feb. 28 regarding the definition of such a store after the Jan. 14 Omnibus Alcoholic Beverage Regulatory Emergency Amendment Act of 2012 required the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to define the term “full service grocery store” within 45 days.
The proposed definition identifies a number of requirements for full-service grocery stores, including a standard that 50 percent of retail space must be dedicated to at least four of five product categories including fresh, uncooked or unprocessed meats or vegetables; breads, cereals or baked goods; dairy products and dry groceries.
The majority of drugstores do not meet this standard, which has generated protest from CVS and Walgreens representatives,
“[Ward 3] Councilmember Mary Cheh, using her political office and influence, inappropriately waged an aggressive campaign to sway this board to reject pending license applications,” CVS attorney Paul Pascal said at the hearing. “Pending applicants should not be penalized, particularly after paying expensive fees, because there has been a political change of heart regarding the scope of the full-service supermarket.”
Walgreens representatives expressed frustration as well.
“In order to be competitive, Walgreens must offer the same one-stop shopping as the chain supermarkets and mass merchants,” Walgreens attorney Rick Conner said during the hearing. “We find the present targeted attack against Walgreens in the form of these proposed regulations so surprising. These proposed regulations are the direct result of our efforts to secure a [Class] B license for our one-year-old store at Connecticut Avenue and Veazey [Terrace].”
Two applications for liquor licenses have been granted to Walgreens in the past, but the Connecticut Avenue Walgreens’ application incited protest last year from neighbors and Cheh.
“It seems clear to me that [Walgreens’] ‘primary business and purpose’ is not the sale of a full range of fresh, canned and frozen food items,” Cheh told the ABCB on Dec. 13, 2012. “Therefore, based on its findings of facts, I believe that the board erred in reaching the legal conclusion that Walgreens could meet the requirements of the grocery store exemption.”
But according to Conner, area residents have voiced little opposition to the stores selling alcohol.
“A mere handful, less than five neighbors, are fighting the license application,” Conner said at the hearing.
There are no current plans, however, for this issue to affect the Georgetown CVS locations at 1403 Wisconsin Ave. NW or 2819 M St. NW. CVS Public Relations Officer Mike DeAngelis wrote in an email that the pharmacy chain was not pursuing licenses at other D.C. stores.
Whether or not the local CVS applies for a license, neighborhood officials say that they will likely not oppose an application.
“Essentially, I have an open mind,” Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E Commissioner Tom Birch said. “I don’t see any reason why should we be closed to that idea.”
Despite the protests from Cheh and others, DeAngelis contended that CVS should be allowed to sell alcohol.
“CVS pharmacy sells liquor in about half of our stores chain-wide for the convenience of customers who choose to purchase it,” DeAngelis wrote. “We have an excellent reputation as a responsible seller of alcohol with firm policies and procedures in place to prevent minors from purchasing it.”
The ABCB is currently considering the testimony and has not yet rendered a decision, according toABRA Public Information Officer William Hager.

Lauinger Library launched a new online group study room booking system to replace its former Google Documents booking system March 26.
Under the new system, students can use a mobile app to book study rooms by scanning a barcode on the door of any library study room or reserve rooms through the library’s website.
Previously, students could reserve rooms for a minimum of one hour and a maximum of three hours. Rooms could be booked up to a week in advance, but same-day reservations were not allowed. Under the new system, rooms can now be booked in 30-minute segments, though the three-hour maximum remains the same. Students still must reserve rooms at least 12 hours in advance.
As with the former Google Docs system, a reservation schedule will be posted on each study room every day.
“If nobody’s signed up for the rooms, they’re first come, first served,” Department of Access Services Circulation/Reserves Coordinator Jeffrey Popovich said. “If it’s empty, it’s yours until somebody who has booked it shows up.”
The new system uses a program called LibCal by Springshare, a calendaring app for libraries that has been used by the library at the School of Foreign Service campus in Doha, Qatar.
“We were initially going to reserve rooms through [Gelardin New Media Center’s] checkout system, but it didn’t really have the parameters that we needed,” Department of Access Services Head Deborah Cook said. “We were lucky enough to be able to do some testing. Qatar Library already had the system up and running for about a couple of months, and it looked like it was working well for them, so we decided to give it a try.”
According to Popovich, library administrators began discussing a revamp of the reservation system months ago.
“It was finding the right product in terms of ease of use for our patrons. The idea for using this particular product has been going on for about two months,” Popovich said. “It was across the entire library, so it was a very collaborative process.”
The Department of Access Services, Gelardin New Media Center, the Library Information Technology Department and Library Administration were involved in the transition.
“It would have been difficult for Access [Services] just to do it on our own because we needed technology support to get it running smoothly and up on the web,” Cook said.
Popovich said the new system has proven easy to use.
“It’s a very intuitive system, so setting up the parameters we wanted was easy,” Popovich said. “Then, it was just a matter of testing it and making sure all of the things that needed to be done from the technology side of the website got done.”
Despite the extensive testing the library staff performed before the new system’s launch, however, the program went live with a minor glitch: a nonfunctional button labeled “Add to Calendar” pops up when the user receives a second confirmation notice.
“It’s certainly not a show-stopper. It’s better getting it up and running than to wait for [Google Calendars] to fix it,” Popovich said.
According to Cook, the new system will reduce errors and improve booking efficiency.
“Previously … we would get a lot of emails and calls about booking rooms, and sometimes there would be an error where we would put them in the wrong room, so this is hopefully error-free, and everybody gets what they want,” Cook said. “It’s so much better than what we had before.”

Construction on the Silver Line of the Washington Metro, which is designed to extend to Dulles International Airport, is proceeding despite concerns about the possible settling of soil in and around areas of tunnel construction.
A March 6 report commissioned by the city’s airport authority, transit authority and contractors Dulles Transit Partners and Bechtel Corporation, revealed that although roughly an inch of settling has occurred in a tunnel at Tysons Corner, there is still sufficient room for a train.
“There is no safety hazard,” Marcia McAllister, the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority’s communications manager for the Dulles Corridor Metrorail Project, said. “That leaves more than enough capacity for the trains to safely use the tunnel.”
Soil settling is a common issue in underground construction that can delay projects and cause safety concerns.
“Safety is MWAA’s top priority, and, though some settling of the ground is expected in significant excavations such as this, the assessment is being undertaken to ascertain the extent to which settling may have occurred,” Christopher Paolino,  media relations manager for MWAA, wrote in an email.
The first phase of the Silver Line project, which will run from the existing East Falls Church station to the newly constructed Reston station, is due to be completed in August of this year, and the line is expected to be in service by late December, according to McAllister.
McAllister also expects a contract for the second phase, which will run from Reston to Dulles Airport, to be issued early this summer and said that it will cost an estimated $5.6 billion. McAllister does not expect any further complications in the construction process, with the entire project slated for completion within five years.
“We don’t see any hiccups, but there is always weather,” she said.
However, the sequester — a comprehensive set of federal spending cuts totalling more than $1.1 trillion that went into effect March 1 — may impact overall Metro operations, even though it is not expected to affect the Dulles Corridor project.
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority spokesperson Philip Stewart said that while the authority has received about half of its federal funding for this fiscal year, about $8 million of the remaining expected funding could be compromised by the cuts. He added that ridership might be affected if federal employees face furloughs or layoffs.
“One thing we won’t compromise on [is] safety,” Stewart said. “There are no plans to scale back on our levels of service or our capital rebuilding.”

Washington, D.C., released a fourth version of proposed revisions to food truck regulations March 8, which, if passed, would loosen licensing requirements but restrict locations where food trucks can set up shop.
The provisions would eliminate certain vendor license requirements that treat trucks as sole proprietorships, allow employees to work for more than one vendor and differentiate between non-mobile vendors, food trucks and ice cream trucks, eliciting support from some food truck vendors.
D.C. Food Truck Association Chairman and Red Hook Lobster Pound co-owner Doug Povich said that the current ice cream truck label is troublesome because food trucks currently are not allowed to stop or remain in a location unless customers are waiting.
But the possible regulations governing parking have roused discontent among vendors.
The proposed revisions call for the creation of new mobile roadway vending locations, or MRVs, in 23 general areas of the city that will feature a 500-foot area that excludes other food trucks from selling. The ability to park in an MRV will be distributed to vendors through a lottery system.
“This idea of designating spaces based on what city thinks are good vending locations doesn’t make sense,” Povich said. “It’s not flexible enough to accommodate demand.”
Outside the MRVs, trucks can still vend but only in locations where there is a 10-foot-wide unobstructed sidewalk.
Povich, who is also worried about the opacity surrounding the MRV selection process, said that he has surveyed large portions of the District and determined that much of downtown D.C. and most of Georgetown  would not accommodate this rule, making trucks unable to set up shop at locations around the city based on demand.
Povich said he would like to see the sidewalk requirement eliminated or possibly reduced to six feet.
Patrick Rathbone, owner of the Big Cheese food truck — one of the few food trucks that comes to the Georgetown area — agreed, saying that the 500-foot regulation should be changed to one block.
Rathbone said that he is not particularly concerned that, in theory, the proposed regulations would not allow him to park in his current location near the university’s front gates.
“We don’t really get hassled because we are not causing a disturbance,” Rathbone said. “Nobody is going to chase us down as long as nobody complains.”
In general, the regulations will have little to no impact on the Georgetown area because vending rules are already stringent.
Currently, vendors are not allowed to sell in the Old Georgetown area, with the exception of a vending zone that encompasses N, O, P, Prospect and Dumbarton Streets within 50 feet of their intersections with Wisconsin Avenue. As part of the proposed regulations, MRVs have been assigned to the general areas around other universities in the District such as The George Washington University, but not Georgetown.
Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner Bill Starrels, who represents the southern part of Georgetown, confirmed that the sidewalk limit will stop trucks from selling in the neighborhood. But Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs Legislative and Public Affairs Officer Helder Gil said the impact of the regulations on vending around the university would be minimal.
“We don’t expect to see significant change in the Georgetown area due to the narrowness of most sidewalks,” he wrote. “Because of the narrow sidewalks, only a few sidewalk locations are approved for vending in the Georgetown area.”
The regulations have been submitted to the D.C. Council and must be passed within 60 days.

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled March 19 that it is legal to buy cheaper foreign versions of books overseas and resell or give them away in the United States.
In the case Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, John Wiley, a major textbook publisher, sued SupapKirtsaeng, a Thai student, for importing and reselling for profit foreign-made copies of its textbooks when Kirtsaeng was a graduate student in the United States.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld a lower court’s judgment in favor of Wiley.Kirtsaeng then appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard arguments on his case last fall.
The Supreme Court overturned the lower court’s decision with a 6-to-3 ruling, upholding first-sale doctrine, which protects the buyers of copyrighted works, even if those works were manufactured in countries outside the United States.
The decision is considered a major victory for libraries, while it will be to the detriment of publishers.
“The Court’s decision ensures that libraries can rely on the critically important principle of first sale to continue lending the estimated 200 million foreign-made volumes in our collections,” said the Association of Research Libraries in a press release. “Libraries and our allies remain vigilant in defense of first sale and all of the rights that make it possible to serve our communities.”
Although the Georgetown University Library does not purchase textbooks, the Court’s decision is still significant for Georgetown students, according to Stephanie Hughes, executive assistant to the university librarian and communications coordinator for Lauinger Library.
“The most important part of this decision for libraries is that we will continue to be able to buy and share, including through Interlibrary Loan and consortial arrangements, materials as we always have, regardless of place of publication,” Hughes said.
According to Artemis Kirk, Georgetown’s university librarian, Lauinger will continue to provide its services for collections acquisitions and sharing — locally, nationally and internationally.
“I am very pleased with the decision because it means that libraries worldwide can purchase any edition, published anywhere, of an item and legitimately share it through our well-established lending and interlibrary loan practices,” Kirk said. “In this way, libraries will continue to advance the creation of knowledge by freely sharing the existing knowledge we’ve purchased with our user communities.”
Publishers, in contrast, are reeling from the decision. According to the American Association of Publishers, the ruling will deprive authors of their rightful compensation, threaten the survival of publishers and ultimately shift the burden of cost onto legitimate book buyers. The AAP classifies foreign-made textbooks as “grey-market goods” — those that are unregulated and not authorized by the goods’ manufacturer or producer.
“We are disappointed that the U.S. Supreme Court has decided in favor of Supap Kirtsaeng and overturned the Second Circuit’s ruling,” Stephen M. Smith, Wiley’s president and CEO, said in a press release. “It is a loss for the U.S. economy and [for] students and authors in the U.S. and around the world.”

Though it was launched in 2000, multicultural publication The Fire This Time has faded from campus since a lapse in leadership in 2011. Zoe Gadegbeku (COL ’15) has re-launched the former newsmagazine as a blog designed to represent minority voices on campus.
“We are trying to give insight into different experiences at Georgetown. It is not just a cultural or ethnic thing. We want to emphasize that there are so many different experiences at Georgetown and so many different points of view that we can bring,” Gadegbeku, the blog’s editor-in-chief, said.
The Fire was originally founded in 2000 in response to hate crimes on campus. The Fire’s various incarnations, as well as the most recent re-launch, have been motivated by a deficiency in the representation of minority voices on campus.
“We recognize that there is this idea that we all have different conversations and dialogues about the diversity and experience at Georgetown, but there is not one place for a conversation about these ideas to be found,” General Manager and Graphics and Photography Editor Claytia Gonsalves (SFS’15) said. “We want to reestablish The Fire and bring it back so people can come forward and have an open dialogue, and have a forum for people to discuss what’s on their hearts to discuss.”
Since its initial founding, the newsmagazine has been published intermittently. In 2010, it was re-launched as a part of English professor Athelia Knight’s course “The Fire This Time: Workshop.”
“Leadership is extremely important when it comes to managing the consistent and timely publication of a paper,” Alexandra Bledsoe (SFS ’12), who worked as co-editor-in-chief in Knight’s class, said. “In previous cases, the paper ceased to produce material when there were lapses in leadership.”
Gadegbeku and Gonsalves acknowledged funding and resource challenges The Fire has faced in the past. However, they said they were confident in this incarnation of The Fire’s longevity. The Fire’s membership on the Media Board in recent years has provided access to university benefits and funding. The paper’s new online format eliminates the challenges of printing and distribution that challenged former versions of the publication.
“This is the first time it has been an online blog,” Gonzalves said. “We are on our computers all the time, and it will just be a click away, so we think that will increase readership.”
The publication features six sections, including news and opinion sections. There are 24 writers on staff, but the paper accepts submissions from anyone.
“The goal of the paper is to be a grassroots paper, community paper for people to send in their own stories and really make it their own,” Gonsalves said.
Erika Nedwell (COL ’14), co-vice president of the Black Student Alliance, said she was excited that The Fire would represent minority voices at Georgetown.
“The Hoyaand The Voice are great publications, but oftentimes, as I skim their pages, I find a deficiency of minority students’ perspectives,” Nedwell said. “I’d willingly accept the underrepresentation if students of color truthfully had nothing to say, but I can’t think of anything further from reality. I’m incredibly overjoyed to see that The Fire This Time will finally be making its much overdue return to the Hilltop.”

AlliedBarton Security Services recently hired more than 20 veterans to join Georgetown’s nighttime security force as part of a nationwide veteran employment initiative called the 100,000 Jobs Mission.
The program, which was established in March 2011 by a group of prominent U.S. businesses, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., aims to hire 100,000 military veterans and transitioning service members by 2020. Other members of the mission include IBM, Verizon, Century 21 and Delta Air Lines. As of the end of 2012, these firms had already hired 51,835 veterans.
“We want to put very highly qualified people that served our country back to work,” Jonathan Piccolo,AlliedBarton’s district area manager for Washington, D.C., said.
The staff of newly hired veterans, all of whom joined the company within the past few weeks, has been added to the nearly 40 AlliedBarton officers who were already part of the Georgetown force.
According to AlliedBarton Director of Strategic Recruiting Jerold Ramos, the initiative is aimed at helping young men and women coming out of the military who are placed at a competitive disadvantage in the jobs market because they often lack formal work experience.
AlliedBarton, which joined the mission in the fall, hired 4,500 veterans across the United States last year and aims to hire another 5,000 in 2013. The company has recruited veterans through job fairs and nonprofit organizations related to veterans’ affairs.
Ramos added that the security services industry is a natural fit for many veterans.
“They’re very highly motivated individuals, very well-disciplined, and their experience within the military falls within what security work does,” Piccolo said.
Piccolo said that more veterans will be hired to work at Georgetown in the near future, although the exact number had not yet been determined. He added that AlliedBarton had received positive feedback from clients and managers regarding the newly hired veterans.
Georgetown University Student Veterans Association Vice President Zachary Zimmerman (MSB ’14) noted that while he appreciated AlliedBarton’s efforts to recruit veterans, the university itself must do more to help those who have served their country.
“I think any initiative to assist veterans’ transition into civilian employment is positive,” Zimmerman wrote in an email. “With that being said, I believe adding 20 more veterans to Georgetown’s student body would be more beneficial to veterans in the long term.”

More than 200 Alpha Phi Omega members from 12 universities attended the annual APO Sectionals Conference, held this year on March 23 at Georgetown, to discuss service issues and leadership strategies.
This marks the first time Georgetown has held the conference since 2005.
According to APO Vice President of Finance David Lizza (COL ’15), the chance to interact with APO members from other schools is one of the most important elements of the conference. Other participating schools included George Mason University, the University of Maryland and Howard University.
“Our chapters don’t have too much interaction, but when we host or attend an event, we get to see some faces of the other chapters, which I think is important for collaborating and spreading ideas, whether it be for service or leadership or fundraising,” Lizza said.
The Georgetown APO Chapter funded the conference using proceeds from tickets, which cost $26 for undergraduate members and $31 for alumni. In addition, the organization used membership dues and supplemental funding from the Georgetown University Student Association, APO alumni and sponsors including Wingo’s, Mai Thai and Aveda Salon and Spa.
The Georgetown APO leadership said that the conference was worth the cost.
“It is a huge opportunity for us to showcase Georgetown University and the Center for Social Justice, to promote the work we do on campus and in the community and to offer training to improve the service programs APO runs throughout the greater D.C. area,” 2012 APO President Tom Barnes (SFS ’13) said.
APO alumna Maura Harty (SFS ’81), former Make-A-Wish Foundation Mid-Atlantic Chapter CEO and former State Department Foreign Service officer, gave the conference’s keynote address. Harty spoke about her time as a member of APO and how those values have translated to her professional experience.
Conference workshops featured approximately 25 presenters, including APO alumnae and speakers from ESCAPE, the After School Kids Program, the D.C. Schools Project, GUSA and Students of Georgetown, Inc.
“We find it important to interact with other organizations on campus to facilitate a better understanding of each other’s service efforts and a discovery of a commonality of goals,” Conference Chair Anastasia Taber (COL ’13) said.
Attendees said that the variety of speakers gave valuable insights and offered different perspectives.
“My biggest takeaway was the wide array of different techniques or methods we can use to achieve one common goal and how there is not necessarily a right or wrong answer for how to do service,” Dana Suekoff (COL ’16) said. “We need to adjust to meet people’s needs if we are going to get something done.”
In addition to workshops, the conference involved leadership activities and reflection discussions promoting the APO values of leadership, friendship and service.
“Speakers on fellowship and leadership explained to us how we can work toward these themes in our undergraduate work as well as how to continue those values after we graduate,” Lizza said.
Overall, APO members said they were proud of how the conference unfolded.
“We portrayed a very positive view of the university and what it has to offer,” Lizza said. “All the members worked really hard to make sure that it ran smoothly and it did.”

Eight Tunisian scholars explored the possibility of establishing a democracy studies program in the North African republic during a visit to Georgetown last week.
Georgetown professors collaborated with the visiting scholars, who included representatives from the University of Tunis, the University of Kairouan, the University of Manar and the School for Higher Education in Economic and Commercial Sciences, from March 17 to 23.
According to Co-Director of the Master of Arts in Democracy and Governance Studies program DanielBrumberg, the academic community in Tunisia has looked to Georgetown for advice partly because it suffered under the reign of former dictator Ben Ali.
“The systematic study of comparative politics, international relations [and] human rights suffered. We are assisting [scholars in Tunisia] in reconstituting these programs, in standing up a new democracy after decades of authoritarianism,” Brumberg said.
Tunisian academics, the Democracy and Governance Studies program at Georgetown and the United States Institute of Peace and the Project on Middle East Democracy are working together on the initiative. USIP contributed two-thirds of the funding for this visit, while the Democracy and Governance Studies program funded the remaining third.
Mohamed Sarsar, a professor of law and political science at the University of Tunis and one of the visiting academics, said that Tunisia must confront a series of problems in order to establish a stable democracy.
“There are three challenges [for Tunisia],” Sarsar said.  “There are challenges about constitutional building and the second challenge is the election — how we should [succeed] the next election — and three is justice. We have a big problem with our judge; we should reform the judicial system and we need a transitional justice.”
Eight Georgetown faculty members presented about their courses in democracy studies. The Tunisian academics took home relevant readings, syllabi and disks.
“The bulk of it is sitting down and doing the hard work of thinking about curricula [for their program],”Brumberg said.  “We didn’t want to go into this imposing any sort of preconceptions about what the results of this endeavor would be, but we wanted to open the process of brainstorming and dialogue.”
Professor of public law and political science at the University of Kairouan in Tunisia Haykel BenMahfoudh said that there are more opportunities than obstacles in creating a democracy studies program in Tunisia.
“We need to take advantage of what we have already in our home country, but also to strengthen based on the [longstanding American] experience in terms of political science.” Mahfoudh said. “It doesn’t mean that we want to move straight to that system, but at least to get our teaching in terms of political science much more open, richer, and to offer a variety given the new context and the new challenges and stakes that we have to take up in Tunisia.”
Participating professors from Tunisia and Georgetown discussed setting up a Summer Democracy Workshop for summer 2014 to push forward this initiative.
“This week was really a tremendous success on many levels, not least of which was creating a core group of U.S. and Tunisian scholars and experts who will be the vanguard for this program,”Brumberg said.
The scholars will convene for a follow-up meeting in June or July in Tunisia.
