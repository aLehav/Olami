A new Student Activities Commission funding system has left many club leaders struggling to adapt to a setup that requires planning for events as early as six months in advance.
The procedure, called the Programming Arc, was introduced last October, when group heads signed an agreement to abide by the new guidelines for receiving approval and funding for their events.
This semester, however, leaders have had difficulty understanding the agreement as they battle with SAC to get the funding that they had hoped to receive.
The Programming Arc system marks a break from traditional SAC funding practices. Previously, money was allocated on an event-to-event basis; under the new guidelines, however, clubs are required to submit a detailed outline of their planned events for the entire upcoming semester about two months before the semester begins. Leaders then revise those plans with their own SAC commissioner and an adviser from the Center for Student Programs.
After the outline is solidified, SAC leaders review it for approval and allocate a bulk sum of funding intended to last the club for the semester. Once the sum is received, SAC does not provide extra funding for expenses that might arise later.
According to SAC Commissioner Dalvin Butler (COL ’13), the new system aims to improve productivity in the organizations SAC oversees — and within SAC itself.
“This process allows for student organizations to effectively plan for their semester in advance,” Butler explained. “It [also] allows [SAC] to have shorter meetings.”
While more concise meetings may be beneficial for SAC, club leaders say that the programming arc has become more of a nuisance than an aid.
According to Carolyn Chambers (COL ’11), chair of the university’s NAACP chapter, programming guidelines prevent the groups from being able to add events when they crop up, which she said hurts organizations much more than early planning helps them.
“I think the whole concept for submitting something in October that will decide something for the next six months is a little ridiculous,” Chambers said.
Back in December, the NAACP chapter attempted to receive approval for a hip-hop concert to be hosted in March. The SAC committee denied them, however, because the event had not been included on their original outline, she explained.
“It stops people from being creative because you have to plan so far in advance,” Chambers said.
SAC Commissioner Ruiyong Chen (SFS ’13) said that the commission was still working out the kinks in the system.
“The Bulk Allocation model is only in its first semester of implementation and we recognize that it’s not perfect,” she said in an email. On the whole, however, she believes in the efficiency of the new system. She added that in a GUSA survey of SAC group leaders last year, the majority of student leaders favored the bulk allocation model over the event-by-event model.
“The system allows for much more flexibility and empowers students to take charge of their group’s finances for the entire semester,” Chen explained. “Group leaders will rarely need to come in to long SAC meetings on Mondays to present line by line finances for an event, which makes the entire process much smoother and less time consuming for everyone.”
Leaders remain skeptical, especially as SAC’s approval of the semester outline does not necessarily mean that each individual event has been approved. Instead, club leaders have to re-approach SAC leaders before every event they hold to confirm that the event has been given the commission’s seal of approval.
“Some groups think since SAC approved their Programming Arc, that they are simply free to go forth with a student activity, and that is not the case,” Butler clarified.
Though SAC’s new measures are not widely popular among club leaders, the commission enforces its guidelines with a stringent punishment policy. If groups do not abide by the measures outlined in the agreement that they signed, SAC has the ability to repeal events.
Chen said that she was aware of the concerns held by SAC – affiliated clubs.
“We are working right now to incorporate student group leaders’ input and address their concerns as we tweak the Funding Guidelines for the next academic year,” she said.
Correction: This article originally quoted Greg Napper (MSB ’12), captain of the men’s club soccer team, implying club sports are funded through the Student Activities Commission. Club sports are funded via the advisory board for club sports.

More than a year after a group of students and professors called on Georgetown to increase diversity of faculty members, the university has mapped out plans to hire more minorities and emphasize diversity in the curriculum — but so far, sweeping changes have yet to materialize.
The percentage of minorities among faculty on the main campus dropped slightly over the past two years, from 13 percent in 2008 to 12 percent currently. The decline was mostly due to a one point decrease in the percentage of Hispanic professors.
“Generally speaking, Georgetown is doing well with faculty diversity as increasing numbers of women and minority persons, particularly Asian-American faculty, are hired each year to join the faculty ranks,” said Rosemary Kilkenny, vice president for institutional diversity and equity. “However, the hiring of black and Hispanic faculty [remains] elusive.”
With the Law Center and Medical School included, 18 percent of Georgetown’s full-time faculty are minorities — a rate higher than those of almost all other leading universities in the nation. Only 13 percent of full-time faculty members at both Harvard University and University of Notre Dame are minorities, according to a 2009 survey by The Chronicle of Higher Education.
Even so, the decline in main campus faculty diversity from 13 to 12 percent comes more than a year after University President John J. DeGioia announced the Initiative on Diversity and Inclusiveness, an attempt to foster greater respect for diversity on campus.
As part of the initiative, three working groups — on admissions, academics and student life — met during the 2009-2010 academic year to produce a set of recommendations for the university. One of the key recommendations of the Working Group on Academics called for the hiring of more faculty who represent minorities, along with more faculty whose work focuses on underrepresented populations.
University Provost James O’Donnell claims the university has worked hard to make every faculty search one that also looks for diversity while stepping up overall recruiting practices. He added that the school has created a new position in African-American history, a spot they hope to fill by next semester.
“We realized we weren’t putting enough academic muscle into that area,” O’Donnell said.
University officials said they also hope to explore beefing up the African-American studies department as a whole and are also considering building Latin American and Asian-American studies programs.
“I think we’re doing better than ever,” O’Donnell said. “And we can do better.”

While the university cites attempts to boost representation of minorities among faculty, many administrators, professors and students say Georgetown isn’t doing nearly enough.
“It’s a big problem,” said Dennis Williams, director of the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access. “We don’t seem to be as concerned about it as we should be.”
Williams said that discussions on diversity tend to be focused on the diversity of the student body, but he thinks that’s just one piece of the puzzle.
“Faculty need to be a part of this conversation,” Williams said.
Stephanie Frenel (SFS ’12), who started working with the Initiative on Diversity and Inclusiveness her freshman year at Georgetown, said she has been disappointed by the university’s response to the recommendations of the Working Group on Academics.
“You’re getting taught the same exact point of view — not always, but sometimes  —  and that’s not realistic,” she said.
Students and professors said there were a number of factors contributing to a dearth of diverse faculty.
“Retention is an issue,” said Rosemary Kilkenny, vice president for institutional diversity and equity. “Over the years we have lost tenured black professors to other universities.”
Williams said he’s also aware of several cases in the last few years in which minority applicants were denied tenure.
“One way of improving diversity is to make sure we are actually keeping the people we hire,” Williams said.
Maurice Jackson, a history professor, has been active in pushing for greater minority representation at Georgetown. He said he was lucky to have great advisers and a supportive department, but he worries that other young minority faculty members may not be as fortunate.
“Sometimes they don’t get the support they need,” he said.
But University Provost James O’Donnell said that the tenure process is rough on all applicants.
“We don’t see that there’s a difference in how people do for tenure by gender or minority status,” he said.
Williams said that a lack of diversity can become a vicious cycle, making it harder to attract new minority faculty. “Having that diversity sends a strong message,” he added.
Most students and professors said they had not seen any real changes after the working group made its recommendations, but many were hopeful that the initiative itself was a sign that things might be changing.
Veronica Salles-Reese, a professor in the department of Spanish and Portuguese and co-chair of the working group, said that she thought one of the most important effects of the working group was to bring the issue to the forefront.
“The frame, the mindset — if you can talk about an institution having a mindset — was changed in the right direction,” she said. “But these are things that cannot be done overnight.”
Jackson said that he’s grateful to University President John J. DeGioia’s office for funding the new position in African-American history and hopes it will be the beginning of a new push to diversify academics.
“The goal of raising the funds and of hiring several more African-Americans in the coming years will be made a reality,” Jackson said. “I have been given that assurance.”
O’Donnell said he expects to make several new minority hires by the end of the year.
But others aren’t so sure that the university is trying its best.
“I think that because it’s so simple there really is no excuse,” said Ryan Wilson (COL ’12), a member of the working group. “It’s about putting your money where your mouth is.”
Wilson said that the diversity of Georgetown’s faculty is becoming a more prominent concern as the diversity of the student body continues to grow. This year, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions saw a 25 percent rise in the number of applications from black students and a 34 percent increase in applications from Latino students.
“It is an issue,” said Antony Lopez (COL ’14), MEChA’s freshman representative. “You can visually see that there aren’t enough faculty from different races.”
But what concerns Lopez more is that this lack of racial diversity might contribute to a lack of diversity in beliefs and backgrounds, making it harder for students to find professors to identify with.
On the other hand, Williams said that because a number of Georgetown students come from relatively privileged and sheltered backgrounds, many have not been exposed to the diversity in authority and opinion that would stem from a higher number of diverse faculty.
“That’s an important part of their education,” he said.
Jackson worries that for some Georgetown students, their primary exposure to the black community takes place through service in underprivileged neighborhoods in D.C., creating a skewed image of the demographic as a whole.
Frenel said she thinks that improving faculty diversity is a perennial problem that many colleges and universities, not just Georgetown, are facing, but that the university needs to step up its response.
“Georgetown isn’t very susceptible to change,” she said. “They still have a lot to do.”

With another political protest set to hit the streets of Cairo today, a handful of Georgetown students studying abroad in Egypt are getting a first-hand look at a subject central to many of their studies.
On Tuesday, thousands across the country protested the regime of Hosni Mubarak, after a similar uprising in Tunisia led to the toppling of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali on Jan. 14. The Egyptian regime responded forcefully, and over 700 protesters have been arrested since Tuesday, according to the BBC. Another protest is scheduled for Friday following midday Muslim prayer.
“The current events in Cairo, in light of what’s happening in Tunisia recently, are certainly interesting for anyone to witness, especially students of political science or those interested in the Middle East,” Michelle Saks (COL ’12), who is currently studying at the American University in Cairo, said in an email. “The ability to witness individuals gather in unity, truly passionate about their nation’s future is admirable.”
Saks said that while she did not witness Tuesday’s protest in person, she is excited for today’s developments.
“Apparently, the Muslim Brotherhood will be participating officially this time and some say it may be larger than Jan. 25th’s protest,” she said. “Based on protests in November in response to parliamentary elections in Egypt it is certainly not shocking that Egyptians would gather the way they have been over the past few days.”
Egyptians are protesting Mubarak’s regime, which has placed a stranglehold over the Egyptian democratic process using emergency law, corruption and election fraud, according to Saks.
“Reading some of the protesters’ demands makes it quite clear that [they] have legitimate demands and I am pretty sure that most Egyptians are at least sympathetic to their cause,” she said.
None of Georgetown’s students studying abroad in Cairo have been endangered at this point, according to Laurie Monarch, overseas studies adviser for the Middle East in the Office of International Programs.
“Both the American University in Cairo and Georgetown are carefully monitoring events, including updates and advice from the U.S. Department of State,” she said in an email. “We have advised students to avoid all areas where demonstrations are occurring, and we have also urged them to maintain regular contact with their parents to assure them of their well-being.”
Monarch said that the protests had not affected orientation week activities and the university will start classes next week as planned.

Bradley Cooper isn’t the only Georgetown graduate to have graced the red carpet at the Sundance Film Festival. Of the 16 films chosen this year, three feature the acting or production of former Georgetown students.
“It’s a crazy little Georgetown festival we have going on here,” director Zal Batmanglij (COL ’02) said Wednesday to TBDArts, a Washington, D.C. news organization.
Included in the feature-length narrative category of the festival are “Sound of My Voice,” directed by Batmanglij and “Another Earth,” directed by Mike Cahill (COL ’01). Both films star Brit Marling (COL ’05), who also co-wrote the movies.
While predominantly science fiction, the plots of the movies also incorporate aspects of emotional human drama.
Both directors were able to enlist the help of successful actors in their works. Marling worked alongside Christopher Denham of “Charlie Wilson’s War,” as well as William Mapother from “Lost.”
Also featured at the festival is “Rebirth,” a documentary that chronicles the impact of the 9/11 attacks on the lives of survivors and is directed by Jim Whitaker (CAS ’90).
Batmanglij and Cahill began their respective careers in filmmaking while studying at Georgetown University. The pair met Marling after showing a joint endeavor in GUTV’s film festival.
Georgetown students’ continuing interest in film led to the creation of the film and media studies minor this fall. The recent success of Batmanglij, Cahill and Marling has been encouraging for students in the pilot class of the program.
“It opens more doors for us in this new film guinea pig program,” Josh Sizer (COL ’12), who is pursuing the minor, said. “For those of us who want to go into that industry, it’s awesome to hear about. It makes me feel like [a career in film] is more possible.”
Sizer feels that the achievement of future filmmaking projects by Georgetown students depends on their relationship with successful graduates.
“A lot of film schools are based on networking and keeping connections because the film industry is one of those industries where everyone knows everyone,” he said. “If Mike and Brit are willing to help students … that would be really great.”

The Senior Class Committee remembers every mistake it has made this year.
That’s because this year’s group, which organizes events like Senior Ball, Senior Disorientation and Senior Auction, keeps a precise log of its activity, missteps and all.
The goal, according to board member Ana-Alicia Siqueiros (COL ’11), is to leave future committees with a journal of triumphs and failures that will hopefully make planning more efficient in the future.
“The biggest thing that we want to take on is to be a little more organized in how we transition and in how we keep notes on what has gone wrong and what has gone right,” Siqueiros said.
This year’s committee, however, has not seen much defeat. Though the group admits that it could do better in some areas, Andrew Malzberg’s (COL ’11) leadership as chairman of the board of SCC has helped to make the committee one of the most successful in recent years. The board was able to bring Lupe Fiasco to campus for a Halloween weekend concert, the first fall concert since 2007.
Non traditional events like the Fiasco show are the hardest to coordinate, but Malzberg believes that Georgetown’s annual spring concert was not enough. As a transfer, he saw the two-concert structure that Emory University enjoys and hoped to bring the same framework to the Hilltop. The board members all agreed.
This week, the SCC has tackled another one of its greatest challenges — Dis-Orientation 2.0. The weeklong event, which will end Friday night with a bar crawl in Dupont Circle, was less than popular last year, as the previous organizational committee was unable to raise enough support to make a profit. After reforming the structure, however, the SCC was able to entice 600 registrants and Dis-O 2, as board members call it, has been a fundraising winner.
“We are halfway through, and we’ve already made a profit,” Senior Auction Chair Liz Kneuer (COL ’11) said on Tuesday. The funds will be put toward Senior Week, the pre-graduation festival that culminates in Senior Ball.
The key to this year’s success has been organization, which the group sought to foster before its event planning even began. Committee members took a day off together to traverse a ropes course, a quick vacation that Malzberg hoped would forge friendships and unity within the group. Board members also took a similar retreat that taught them how to best get along before actually setting the agenda.
“We did a lot of personality tests, which helped us learn how to communicate with one another,” Kneuer said.
Despite the positive attitude from Malzberg, Kneuer and other organizers, some seniors have expressed discontent with the events so far. They said the events have been organized well, but have not been especially exciting.
“They’re not very appealing,” Max Stoiber (SFS ’11) said. “It’s hard to find an event where I’m really thinking ‘I’d like to go to that one.'”
Though she has been a regular attendee, Kathleen Mulvaney (COL ’11) explained that she was unimpressed by the SCC’s events as well. Last autumn’s Dis-Orientation was plagued by bus transportation troubles, she said, which prevented some people from making the bar crawl. According to Mulvaney, this week’s Dis-O 2.0 has been underwhelming, too.
“Me and my friends are kind of disappointed,” she said. “It feels like we paid money, but didn’t get much value. We didn’t have to pay a cover at McFadden’s, but we checked and found out that the ice skating cost the same whether or not we signed up [for Dis-O 2.0].”
In the future, students explained that they hope that the events will be a tad more enticing.
“The quality of events is just not ideal,” Stoiber said.
That’s not to say that everyone is dissatisfied. Some seniors enjoyed the increase in the number of events and opportunities to celebrate senior year with their classmates.
“They’ve done more than I thought they would and more than I heard has been done in other years,” said Tessa Mooney (COL ’11).
“They’ve definitely gone above and beyond my expectations,” Maura Duffy (COL ’11) added.

Speed-dating met the career search in the “Ready, Set, Connect!” speed-networking event, attended by students and alumni alike, at the Georgetown Hotel and Conference Center on Monday.
The event, co-sponsored by the Alumni Association and the Patrick Healy Fellows, was designed to give students experience in forming connections with Georgetown alumni.
“Networking is everything in today’s world,” Emily White, event organizer and assistant director of alumni career services, said. “We wanted to give students the chance to hone in their networking skills and give them an understanding of how strong and vibrant the Georgetown alumni community is, and how it’s there for them now and when they graduate.”
The event consisted of two networking sessions. The first was designed like a speed-dating session, as students and alumni lined up facing one another and were given five minutes to talk. At the end of the five minutes a bell was rung and the students moved down the line to talk with the next alum.
“It’s kind of scary,” Colleen Kearns (COL ’11) said of the speed-dating format, “But it’s good in that it forces you to talk to people you might not have thought about. You might learn things you weren’t expecting to.”
Afterward, students were encouraged to network with various alumni who specialized in the students’ particular fields of interest.
“It’s a good opportunity to meet people I can be in contact with over the next few years as I go to medical school and beyond,” Matt Pacana (NHS ’12) said.
The importance of networking was constantly emphasized throughout the conference. According to Bill Reynolds (C ’79), executive director of the alumni association, 75 percent of jobs are obtained through networking.
“Networking is not a dirty word, it’s an integral part of the process,” Reynolds told students.
Alumni at the event agreed.
“In my current career, networking is absolutely critical. It’s all about who you know and how to find value in those relationships,” Gloria Lozano (SFS ’04) said.
Participants also believe that a degree from Georgetown can go a long way in forming valuable networking relationships.
“Whether you’re in Kazakhstan or Kansas, Doha or Dallas, we have alumni from all over the world who [have] an earnest desire to build a bridge with the next generation of Hoyas,” Reynolds said. “We are a community; we are Georgetown.”

The trend toward online education is picking up steam, as The George Washington University made a surprising announcement on Jan. 13 — the launch of a fully online-operated high school.
The institution began classes last week and counts 16 enrolled students in nine states, according to The Hatchet, GWU’s student newspaper. The school aims to cater to the needs of students nationwide and provide a research opportunity for the university’s Graduate School of Education and Human Development.
The school will offer 100 Advanced Placement and standard classes for an annual tuition of just under $10,000. It is targeted at students with social disorders and teens forced to move often due to athletic commitments or parents in the military, according to The Hatchet.
In addition to the use of online lectures and exams, the program allows students to participate in both online interaction, including interactive online class sessions, tutorials and one-on-one discussions, as well as offline activities, including access to a summer enrichment program on GWU’s campus, according to a press release from the university. Despite the high school’s novel nature, GWU officials involved with the program believe that students will still receive a balanced education.
“The online experience can enhance and enrich the ‘high school experience,'” Associate Dean of the GSEHD Robert Ianacone said in an email.
Ianacone said that the students will have a high level of interaction with instructors, counselors and other support personnel, as well as with the program’s career counseling service. The school will also focus on new technology that reflects the way young people communicate in today’s world.
The university believes that the project will also give graduate students a chance to monitor the effects of online learning as it becomes more widespread.
“With the exponential growth of online learning as both a supplement and alternative to brick and mortar schooling, it is vital for our best scholars to be involved in research on how people most effectively learn in these environments,” Ianacone said in an email.
This research can help identify what kinds of technologies best support and enhance learning and what designs and implementation strategies are best for online learning, he said.
The cyber-school’s classes are designed for students planning to attend top-tier four-year colleges and universities. The school also offers a four-year curriculum that aims to help students plan for success in college and to foster personal and professional achievement through the development of leadership, problem solving, and interpersonal communication abilities, Ianacone said.
While GWU will actively monitor the program, K12, an online education provider, will oversee the curriculum and coordinate the school. Founded in 2000, K12 is the nation’s largest provider of proprietary curriculum and online education programs for kindergarten through high school students.

With a newly defined mission to provide a dynamic forum for debate, The Georgetown Progressive, the official publication of the Georgetown University College Democrats, has recently re-launched.
“In the past [the coverage] may have been more of a regurgitation of the news, but now we’re doing more analysis from a progressive point of view,” Co-Editor-in-Chief Josh Zeitlin (COL ’13) said.
The blog reports on campus and local events that directly affect that Georgetown community, as well as national and international news. Recent coverage has included President Obama’s State of the Union — which they covered with live streaming updates — current political unrest in Tunisia and commentary on the federal budget.
“We noticed that there was not a campus publication that focuses on [progressive] issues and news analysis the way we do, and we wanted to fill that gap,” Co-Editor-in-Chief Ricky Garza (SFS ’13) said.
While The Georgetown Progressive has had several starts and stops in the past, both as a print and online publication, Zeitlin and Garza decided to pursue the online platform for this most recent re-launch. They stated that hits on the blog vary depending on the posting, and that they had about 400 visitors during their coverage on the State of the Union on Tuesday evening.
“The online format is good because we are able to better target our readership. We can advertise through Facebook and re-tweet our articles,” Garza said.
Zeitlin added that the blog format allows for an immediate response to current events, compared to a less-timely print publication.
Zeitlin and Garza hope that the content on the blog will highlight differences within the liberal community on campus. Additionally, they plan on showcasing a number of guest bloggers from other campus student groups to add more diversity.
The staff of the publication includes Zeitlin and Garza as Co-Editors-in-Chief, two managing editors, two associate editors and about six consistent writers.
“The staff is very, very dedicated. Before it may have been just several people working on [the blog], but now every person who puts work into the blog really believes in it. We have seen very strong growth,” Garza said.
While The Georgetown Progressive operates under the auspices of the College Democrats’ Communications department, the blog is described as relatively autonomous in terms of content, writing and editing. It is only nominally accountable to the communications director, according to Jon Coumes (SFS ’13), GUCD communications director.
