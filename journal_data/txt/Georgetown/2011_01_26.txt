A laptop was stolen from an unsecured, unoccupied dorm room in Village C East on Monday, according to the Department of Public Safety’s Associate Director Joseph Smith. It is the first laptop stolen from a residence this semester.
The student left the residence at 6 p.m., and returned at 7:15 p.m. to find that a laptop had been taken from a backpack, according to a Public Safety Alert sent to the campus community on Wednesday afternoon.
“This is the first residential laptop loss of the semester,” Smith said in an email. “There was one burglary at the Med-Dent Building during break, but no residences.”
The forced burglary in the Med-Dent building was reported on Dec. 29, when a faculty member discovered several personal, non-electric items and an XM radio missing from his office.
While this is the first reported burglary of a university residence so far this semester, it follows a series of reports of laptops being stolen from unlocked residences during the fall semester.
No suspects or witnesses have been identified. DPS’s investigation is ongoing.

All of East Campus, which comprises the Edmund A. Walsh Building and Nevils and LXR residence halls, lost power yesterday around 12:30 p.m., according to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh. After the weather delayed facilities workers on the ground, power was restored around 3 a.m. today.
Patrick Killilee, executive director of student housing, sent an email to East Campus residents at about 8:30 p.m., notifying them that the university had a generator on the way for the evening but encouraging students to seek housing elsewhere.
“We can offer temporary housing in current vacancies in rooms and apartments with other students. If you are staying in a temporary space, you will need to take bedding with you, and other supplies you may need,” Killilee said in the email.
Students were also able to borrow air mattresses, a few of which were available in the Leavey Center, according to the email.
By 4:45 a.m., however, the university operating status site said that full power had been restored. Killilee sent out an email at 7:30 a.m. confirming the status.
“Early this morning power was restored to East Campus.  With the exception of one elevator in LXR, all systems are working properly,” he said. ” While Facilities staff works to correct the cause of this power outage, the generator brought in last night will continue to provide power to the complex.”
Local electricity provider Pepco had been delayed for several hours last night because of a winter storm. The university is on a liberal leave policy today because of the weather and all classes before 11 a.m. are cancelled.
Sarah MacDougall (SFS ’13), an East Campus resident, said that the university had communicated with them through three separate emails.
“The [email] from housing told us that Pepco will be bringing a generator later tonight, but we do not know if that means we’ll have full power or just enough to light the hallways and such,” she said last night. “They recommended that we sleep with friends or in vacant spaces.”
Flashlights were available for residents without power, East Campus Hall Director Billy Colona said in an email to residents at 4 p.m. yesterday. Colona urged residents to seek out other sites on campus such as Lauinger Library and Sellinger Lounge if they needed power or Internet.
A lighting tower was installed in the LXR courtyard, and resident assistants and Department of Public Safety officers would be performing rounds in and around the complex in the evening, according to Colona.

Not every student who arrives on the Hilltop freshman year will take part in Senior Week. Though Georgetown has one of the highest retention rates in the country, some students do choose to leave before the end of their senior year.
The university has a 97 percent freshman retention rate, meaning that three out of every 100 students who begin their freshman year here don’t graduate from Georgetown, according to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh.
According to Pugh, students may leave Georgetown for a variety of reasons, taking into account personal, academic and financial factors.
“Most of the students who leave before graduating do transfer to other institutions,” Pugh said.
Morgan McGrath, now a senior at New York University, transferred after his freshman year for primarily academic reasons.
“I decided during my freshman year that I wanted to study music in college. Georgetown’s music program was very new at the time and did not have what I thought to be sufficient resources, faculty and student interest for what I wanted to study,” McGrath wrote in an email.
He said that he kept his mind open when he came to Georgetown.
“I really did not know what I wanted to major in. I figured I would figure it out during my first year and would then transfer out or stay at the Hilltop depending on where my academic interests ended up going,” McGrath wrote.
Xena Colby, now a senior at Swarthmore College, left Georgetown after her sophomore year. She cited multiple reasons for transferring, including social concerns.
“I really just didn’t belong at Georgetown. As soon as I stepped on campus I didn’t feel like I fit in with the rest of the student body,” Colby wrote in an email. “Everyone during orientation was wearing flowery summer dresses and khaki shorts. I think I definitely stood out in my ripped jean shorts. That feeling never really went away.”
She also said that academic reasons were a factor.
“I felt like the academics at Georgetown were focused on learning skills and information, rather than an emphasis on critical thinking. Georgetown is also very career-oriented, which did not appeal to me at all,” she said. “Basically, I realized that I should have gone to a small, quirky liberal arts school, so I transferred to one.”
The culture at Georgetown was also part of what pushed sophomore Ella Mitchell to transfer from Georgetown to Yale University after her freshman year.
“One thing about Georgetown that I thought I would like was being in D.C., but I found that it seemed like people weren’t as excited about Georgetown-sponsored events because there were so many cool things to do in the city,” she said.
Mitchell also cited an academic focus on politics at the expense of other disciplines as a reason for her decision to transfer.
But this is rare, according to university officials.
“It is rare to encounter a student who discovers that Georgetown was not what they thought it was, and rarer still to find a student who feels they can’t handle the academic workload,” Associate Dean of the College Sue Lorenson said.
Some students end up leaving for financial reasons. McGrath said that he knew some students who transferred to schools closer to home, where tuition is cheaper, though most of his acquaintances had other reasons for their decisions.
“I knew several other people who transferred out of Georgetown, though the ones I knew that left did so for primarily social or personal reasons. They didn’t like the atmosphere at the school and felt like they didn’t fit in,” McGrath said.
In spite of this, Georgetown’s retention rate compares favorably with other schools. Johns Hopkins University and Brown University both share Georgetown’s 97 percent retention rate and the rates at Princeton and Harvard Universities are only 1 percent higher, according to U.S. News and World Report. In contrast, higheredinfo.org reported that the national college retention rate is only 74.7 percent.
Lorenson said that Georgetown’s commitment to providing guidance for students throughout their academic careers was a key reason for Georgetown’s high retention.
“We work hard at letting students know what they can do, and then how they can do it,” Lorenson said.

[…] if I was going happy, at least. I realized that I had to transfer. When I did wind up checking the article about why people had transferred from Georgetown, one quote perfectly captured how I felt: […]
