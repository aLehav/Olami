Georgetown University’s Department of Performing Arts is performing Bitter Flower, a play that examines the racism of the white suffrage movement of the 19th and early 20th centuries. 
Written by Jennifer Natalya Fink, a professor in the English department and an award-winning novelist and playwright, the play features a conversation between suffragette Jane Addams and Ida B. Wells-Barnett, a Black journalist and civil rights advocate. The play seeks to spotlight the racism of the white suffrage movement and the ways in which Black suffragists were ignored and undervalued, despite their contributions to the cause. The show opened Nov. 16 and will run through Nov. 19. 
According to Fink, presenting real historical characters in a fictional setting on stage was an important technique she sought to utilize to highlight the reality of the movement’s history. 
“It’s using what’s sometimes called documentary theater techniques –– using real people, historical documents, in imaginative, made-up ways,” Fink said to The Hoya. “I’m fascinated by both of their stories, who they were as individuals and sort of reclaiming them for American history as central figures.”
Fink said the conversation depicted in the play was based on a series of editorials written by Addams and Wells-Barnett surrounding the issues of suffrage, lynching, civil rights and temperance.
“The more I delved into their relationship, the more complex I realized it was and the
the more I realized that there was a story to be told behind their dueling editorials,” Fink said. “I wanted to take these editorials and humanize them –– put these two women in a room together.”
The play seeks to highlight the flawed rhetoric of the white women’s suffrage movement and draws into focus the advocacy of Black women in the suffrage, anti-lynching and civil rights movements, according to Fink.
“They weren’t just operating as individuals: they were able to create and lead enormous social movements of women,” Fink said. “These two women were such powerhouses, such leaders. One was so flawed in her thinking, Jane Addams, and the other, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, was able to, amidst an incredibly racist white suffrage movement, really advocate and critique it.”
While Black women played an important role in the civil rights and suffrage movements, white women and Black men often excluded Black women from organizations and activities. The National American Woman Suffrage Association barred Black women from attending their conventions, and Black women were often forced to march separately from white women in suffrage parties. 
LaHannah Giles, who plays Wells-Barnett in Georgetown’s current production, said being involved in Bitter Flower has been a rewarding experience.
“The opportunity to portray Mrs. Wells-Barnett and speak out against the many issues present in the early twentieth century has been a healing experience for me,” Giles wrote to The Hoya.
Giles said that the racial issues examined by the play continue to exist in modern society.
“What I hope audiences will take away from the play is that racism still exists and that lynching not an issue of the past,” Giles wrote. “We must continue to discuss these things.”
Anita Gonzalez, a professor of performing arts and African American studies at Georgetown, serves as the play’s director. Gonzalez said she aimed to blend elements of surreality and reality when sharing the historical context of the story.
“I wanted to be able to deliver the text itself in a coherent way, but also one that helped to create a sense of surreality that would surround the characters in the play,” Gonzalez said to The Hoya. 
According to Gonzalez, the play serves as a way for audience members to better understand the full story behind the suffrage movement. 
“I hope that audiences learn more about the controversy within the suffragette movement, and how it was racialized,” Gonzalez said. “And then I hope that they will also be able to, you know, enjoy the show and the music itself and appreciate how it comments on the actions itself.”
The play also includes music by Jonathan Girling, a Royal Shakespeare Company composer and sound designer.
The play ends with the set being transformed into a tea parlor that audiences can sit in. Actors serve the audience tea while still in costume and character, and audience members can listen to speakers from the crew and from organizations around campus, including the Georgetown Racial Justice Institute.
“The tea is a chance for the audience members to chat with the actors and the production team about the meaning and impact of the play,” Gonzalez said. “It’s a chance for them to explore the issues that are raised in the play more deeply.”
Fink said the core historical issues that the play addresses have connections to present political situations and ongoing issues surrounding voting rights.
“I think it speaks sort of powerfully and painfully to the current moment,” Fink said. “At this moment, when the ballot box is once again being denied people of color, when women’s reproductive rights are on the chopping block, these same issues really haunt us. The same struggles around embodiment and power and identity play out around suffrage, around voting, in ways that the play directly speaks to.”

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) launched a new initiative to provide students with free subscriptions to national newspapers and media outlets.
The GUSA initiative hopes to give Georgetown students access to the news sections of The New York Times and the Washington Post free of charge starting in the Fall 2023 semester. Its primary goal is to work with university administration and the library to connect students with national and international publications while alleviating the associated financial burden of subscription costs.
The university currently offers access to both papers through library databases, but Dean of the Library Harriette Hemmasi said access is limited to articles from print editions and does not include online-only or multimedia news content.
Hemmasi said the library staff is happy students are showing interest in gaining access to these publications, and that the library is working with students on making that a reality.
“We recognize the importance of connecting students and faculty with the most current information,” Hemmasi wrote to The Hoya. “We at the library are pleased to be able to respond to student interest like this.”
Ann Oldenburg, journalism professor and assistant director of Georgetown’s journalism program, said she appreciates GUSA’s efforts to give students access to these media outlets.
“I’m thrilled to hear it,” Oldenburg told The Hoya. “In all of our journalism courses we encourage students to read, read, read the news.”
Though the university has not yet approved the publications, Camber Vincent (SFS ’24), the current speaker of the GUSA senate and GUSA president-elect, said student leaders are advocating for The New York Times and the Washington Post because students have shown the most interest in those papers. 
“In a previous newsletter, students overwhelmingly chose those two as the most important in regards to ones they would prefer, ones they didn’t have, and ones the professors assigned,” Vincent told The Hoya.
Oldenburg said she approves of the outlets GUSA has chosen to focus on.
“Those are trusted, longtime sources of information,” Oldenburg said. “The Washington Post is our local paper after all, so we definitely should have access to it.” 
Sebastian Zuba (SFS ’26) said he is excited by the prospect of having free access to these papers’ news sections. 
“I think it’ll be a great opportunity to make access to information easier, and make Georgetown students even more connected to global news,” Zuba told The Hoya.
Vincent said GUSA has done all it can to advocate for the program by conveying student interest to the administration and providing the university with specific publications.
“It’s kind of fully out of our hands,” Vincent said. “It just has to go through the administrative bureaucracy and all of those steps for them to solidify deals with the Washington Post, a deal with The New York Times.”
A university spokesperson said GUSA will play an important role in providing student input throughout the process of making the initiative a reality.
“We look forward to continuing to meet with GUSA leaders as they gather information to inform this proposal,” the spokesperson wrote to The Hoya. “Student input into administrative decisions, particularly those that impact the student experience, is vital.”
If the initiative is successful, Vincent said GUSA will work to expand the program to include other media sources.
“Our goal is to see what the results of the first two are, how utilized they are, students’ response to them,” Vincent said. “If it seems to be going well, if it seems we can get a discount for further publications, we’re going to work to get more publications.”
Oldenburg said students should make an effort to take full advantage of the new initiative if it is successful. 
“Start with something you like to read,” Oldenburg said. “We talk about a Georgetown bubble for students, it’s like that too when we’re reading newspapers. Get out of your bubble, read things you might not normally read, read a section you might not normally read.”

The District of Columbia has launched a new website to help residents find ways to reuse and purchase second-hand items. 
The Department of Energy and Environment has launched Reuse DC, a website that consolidates the virtual resources District residents can use to make more eco-friendly decisions. The site includes an interactive map where residents can enter an address and choose whether they want to repair, donate or shop for pre-owned items including electronics and appliances. The website also provides information about organizations where residents and businesses can donate excess food.
The launch of Reuse DC is part of D.C.’s larger Sustainable DC Plan, which aims to reduce waste generated per capita in the District, facilitate the reuse and recovery of materials and achieve zero waste citywide by 2032.
The program will play an important role in the creation of similar programs and the expansion of sustainable options around the country, according to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  Mid-Atlantic Regional Administrator Adam Ortiz. 
Reuse DC will encourage District residents to broaden their environmentally-friendly practices, Ortiz said.
“By helping communities learn where to repair, donate and purchase second-hand items, these types of programs are taking us from the basic reduce, reuse, recycle ethic to the next level by returning materials of value to the supply chain,” Ortiz wrote to The Hoya. 
Reuse DC also offered grants totaling $64,000 to eight local businesses and nonprofits to support their sustainability efforts. Grantees include Common Good City Farm, a community farm whose mission is to sustain and support a more equitable community through growing and sharing fresh food and The Fresh Food Factory Market, a retail incubator whose objective is to increase the availability of local, ethnic, healthy and affordable food products in the DMV. 
Other resources on the Reuse DC site include a commercial food donation guide and a “What goes where?” tool for residents to determine which items can be recycled or reused instead of being thrown away. The interactive feature also includes a search tool for specific kinds of food waste and where to dispose of them. 
Another feature of the website is Fix-it DC, which includes information about community events for residents to learn how to repair their damaged items. The “Exchange with Neighbors” tab of the website also provides a list of several programs for District residents to connect with and give away or exchange unwanted items with a neighbor. 
Gina Green, a professor at Georgetown’s Earth Commons environmental and sustainability innovation institute, said she hopes the new program will help D.C. residents get more involved in the waste management process in the District.
“Fantastic start for D.C. government to provide the necessary tools to its residents including Georgetown University on how and where we can recycle and truly implement the 3Rs,” Green told The Hoya. “Tools like the website are essential for individual households to participate in reaching D.C.’s Zero Waste goal by 2032.” 
Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network (GREEN) co-president Willow Volkert (COL ’25) said the new program will help residents learn about ways to make eco-friendly choices.
“We think it is a great resource for the DC community and have already begun sharing it with our audiences,” Volkert wrote to The Hoya. “We think it will help DC residents learn about secondhand shopping, as well as increase equity in the city as clothes become more accessible.” 
Ortiz said Reuse DC is a step in the right direction, but is not the end goal.
“EPA commends the District and its partners for putting together a program like Reuse DC, but much more work remains to be done across the country,” Ortiz wrote.

During a celebration for Transgender Awareness Week, students gathered to show their support for transgender people and the LGBTQ+ community after a student group invited a transphobic speaker to campus. 
Over 100 students gathered in Red Square to write chalk messages, including “Trans women are women,” “Protect Trans Youth,” and “Justice for the Trans Community,” to show solidarity with the transgender community and to celebrate Transgender Awareness Week, which takes place from Nov. 14 to Nov. 20. The Georgetown University LGBTQ+ Center, Women’s Center, GU Pride and GU Queer People of Color collaborated to organize the event. 
The Nov. 14 event titled “Riley Gaines: Protect Women’s Sports” was organized by the Georgetown University chapter of Network of enlightened Women (NeW), an organization whose goal is to create dialogue between conservative undergraduate women. NeW invited Riley Gaines to speak about the inclusion of transgender women in women’s sports. Gaines has been criticized for her transphobic rhetoric — including referring to transgender women as “men” — as well as for calling for the exclusion of transgender women from women’s sports. 
Gaines, a former competitive swimmer at the University of Kentucky, first rose to prominence in conservative political circles after she tied for fifth place with Lia Thomas, a transgender woman, in the 200 meter freestyle at the 2022 NCAA Swimming Championships. In the months following the competition, Gaines has made many high-profile appearances where she has spoken against the inclusion of transgender women in women’s sports, including a speech she gave alongside former President Donald Trump at the 2022 Conservative Politcal Action Conference (CPAC).
Liam Moynihan (SFS ’25), who helped organize the Transgender Awareness Week event, said the purpose of the event was to show solidarity with transgender students on campus.
“I was really, really concerned when I heard they were inviting the speaker here,” Moynihan told The Hoya. “Obviously, transphobia has no place on our campus. This event was organized primarily to support the trans and LGBTQ community on campus because we want to emphasize that this is a campus that’s friendly to trans people and is for everyone.” 
Matt Shinnick (COL ’25), who attended the Trans Awareness Week event, said the group decided to frame the chalking as a celebration rather than a protest of the NeW event. 
“We’re actually making a point of not protesting the event. They are doing this to get attention. We didn’t want to do that. We’re having our own event to celebrate trans voices on campus, to show people that they are welcome, but we’re very pointedly ignoring them,” Shinnick told The Hoya. 
Sebastian Cardena (COL ’26), who also attended the Trans Awareness Week event, said giving a platform to people who perpetuate hateful rhetoric harms students who are a part of the LGBTQ+ community. 
“Whether or not these speakers should be allowed on campus is not the relevant question, it’s more so understanding that by inviting them, you are actively harming peers, friends, possibly family and just communities in general,” Cardena told The Hoya.
Despite criticism that the event pushed transphobic ideology, Jessica Costescu (SFS ’23), Georgetown chapter president of NeW, said the organization condemns transphobia. 
“Both NeW as an organization and our student board condemns transphobia. Our decision to host the competitive swimmer Riley Gaines was not motivated by any other reason than our desire to host speakers on a wide variety of topics that affect women today,” Costescu wrote to The Hoya. “At Georgetown we pride ourselves on our mission to support freedom of speech and NeW allows conservative women to do just that on a campus that is far too often hostile to our beliefs.”
Kelsey Ransom (COL ’24) and Morgan Lee (COL ’26), players on the Georgetown women’s basketball team, said Gaines’ characterization of women’s sports is inaccurate. 
Ransom said Gaines dismisses the struggles and oppression Lia Thomas faces as a transgender woman.
“What I didn’t really appreciate was the victimizing of a cisgender white woman who has been privileged her entire life being upset that someone who has been discriminated against is receiving something that they equally deserved,” Ransom told The Hoya. 
Lee said the gender identity of her competitors isn’t relevant during games. 
“If I lost in a competition, I would be upset, but not because it was a trans woman who won,” Lee told The Hoya. “I’d be upset because we just lost a big competition.” 
At the NeW event, Gaines said allowing transgender women to compete in women’s sports is unfair. “I think it’s pretty obvious that men are just inherently stronger, taller,” Gaines said at the event. “You have more power, more endurance and are faster than females when it comes to sports. I think denying that denies logic.”
Lee said these biological differences are an inevitable part of all sport competitions. 
“There’s this whole biological aspect throughout about how Lia Thomas is 6’4 and has muscles. But I’m 6’4, and I’m a cis woman. I could be stronger than most. Those are inherently advantages and disadvantages in sports already,” Lee said. 
 It is important to treat transgender athletes as people, not antagonists, Ransom said. 
“Stop perpetuating transgender women as a danger,” Ransom said. “They’re not dangerous, they’re not antagonizing. They’re not purposely, maliciously going out of their way to be outcasts. Their life is more than just playing the sport they’re playing, so their lifestyle goes beyond their sport.”

Georgetown University’s Masters of Arts in Educational Transformation hosted an informative talk addressing the crisis of decreasing numbers of Black and Brown individuals in the teaching profession. 
The Nov. 11 event, titled “Recruiting and Retaining Teachers of Color,” featured Maria Hyler, director of the Washington, D.C. office of the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank focused on educational system research. The event also featured Curtis Lewis, founder and CEO of the Black Male Educators Alliance (BMEA), a network intended to engage and recruit Black teachers to improve educational outcomes for urban youth. The discussion highlighted key challenges faced by Black educators as well as strategies for reforming school environments to be more inclusive. 
Currently, Black, Hispanic and Asian American individuals each make up less than one-tenth of all public school teachers across the United States, while 53% of public elementary and secondary school students are not white. 
Hyler said the expensive training process required for teachers creates a high barrier to entry, making educational careers inaccessible for many people of color.
“The rising cost of college tuition really keeps people out of the teaching field, and it’s particularly true for teachers of color who are more likely to report that student debt influences their career decisions,” Hyler said at the event.
On average, Black graduates owe $7,400 more in college loans than white students upon graduation. This disparity only increases over time; four years after graduation, Black graduates owe approximately $25,000 more in student loan debt than white graduates. 
Lewis said poor treatment of students of color during childhood also disincentivizes their entry into the teaching field in the future. 
“One of the things we don’t talk about is that schools are often oppressive institutions for students of color,” Lewis said at the event. “If I’ve been oppressed and traumatized by a K-12 schooling system, why would I want to go back and teach?”
According to Hyler, racial discrimination, microaggressions, a lack of resources and limited autonomy within the classroom are all factors that worsen conditions for teachers of color. 
Hyler said employee retainment could be increased through changes in school leadership that aim to uplift teachers of color.
“Administrators set the tone for teaching with learning environments where teachers are part of professional learning communities, receive feedback, have collaboration time, take on leadership roles and engage in shared decision making,” Hyler said. “They can nurture environments where, when there’s an issue of microaggressions and macroaggressions, administrators actually address it and work to have a climate in school that’s inclusive and embracing of all their teachers.”
Hyler said diverse educators can also support the needs of students from underrepresented groups.  
“Racial identities are often central to how teachers of color are able to persist and thrive in racially hostile environments,” Hyler said. “In one study, a Latinx teacher in a rural setting experienced a very racially hostile environment, and yet the percentage of her students were mostly Latinx. So she felt that she not only needed to be there for her students to support them in this space but also be a model of how to push back.” 
Hiring teachers of color improves the quality of educational spaces for all students, including increased test scores, more consistent attendance and reduced suspensions, according to Hyler.  
“We know that students, regardless of their race, benefit from having teachers of color,” Hyler said. “Students are more likely to feel cared about and academically supported when they have teachers of color, and all students can develop the habits and dispositions to live and work in a diverse society by having diverse role models in their classrooms.”
Lewis said diversifying the teaching field begins with long-term solutions; BMEA has implemented an intergenerational mentoring program where high schoolers help teach and tutor elementary students. 
“It is important because, one, as an elementary school student, you begin to see somebody who looks like you that’s helping and supporting you,” Lewis said. “Two, as a high school student, it gives you an opportunity to explore teaching as a profession, to understand the joy and benefits of being a teacher.”
According to Lewis, supporting the future of the teaching industry begins with supporting students of color today. 
“We have to dismantle school policies that hinder the progression of Black and Brown children,” Lewis said. “They have to see success. We have to do our part in making sure they’re feeling loved, cared for and respected in these school spaces.”

Students discussed the safety of abortion pills to terminate pregnancies when traditional abortions are inaccessible or criminalized at a H*yas For Choice (HFC) event Nov. 16. 
The event, titled “Self-Managed Abortion: Information and Destigmatization,” covered the history, science and application of two abortion drugs — misoprostol and mifepristone — based on information provided by Advocates for Youth, a non-profit organization that advocates for sexual and reproductive justice. HFC, a reproductive justice organization at Georgetown University, hosted the event.
Soraya Bata (SFS ’24), the co-director of advocacy and organizing at HFC, led the presentation. 
Bata spoke on the history associated with the drug misoprostol, which was originally used to treat stomach ulcers. 
“In the mid-80s, resilient midwives and pregnant people in Brazil realized that it could be used to induce an abortion,” Bata said at the event. “And so they are the people who started using misoprostol to self-manage their abortions. And they did end up suffering from criminalization due to using misoprostol for abortions.”
The June 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade, a 1973 Supreme Court case that guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion in the United States, prompted 13 states to fully ban abortion in most cases. Nearly one-third of people who can get pregnant have lost the right to have an abortion since the overturning of Roe — one study found that requests for self-managed abortions through an online telemedicine service increased 31% in states with total abortion bans.
The event highlighted the safety of abortion pills, citing the fact that mifepristone is safer than Tylenol. 
Lauryn Ping (COL ’23), HFC vice president, said self-managed abortion, also referred to as Plan C, involves the same pills as clinical abortion through medication. 
“Self-managed abortion is actually very similar to medication abortion,” Ping said at the event. “If you were to go into a clinic and get the medication there, they would give you the first medication, and then you’d go home and take it, and then take the second medication at home. So self-managed abortion is kind of just cutting out that beginning process for you.”
For individuals living in states where abortion is banned, seeking out medication to terminate a pregnancy is a crime with punishments ranging from fines to up to two years in prison. However, if a pregnant person faces any complications after taking misoprostol or mifepristone to self-manage an abortion, their symptoms are identical to those present during a miscarriage.
This means that individuals who have taken Plan C to self-manage an abortion can seek medical attention without fear of prosecution, which is lifesaving in some cases, according to Bata.
“If they fall ill and need medical attention, they can go to the hospital and tell the doctor that they’re miscarrying,” Bata said. “And if they follow this procedure, then there won’t be any evidence that they had an abortion, they can just say that it’s a miscarriage.”
Individuals can orally take 200 milligrams, or four tablets, of mifepristone, followed by 200 milligrams of misoprostol 24 hours later. Alternatively, if mifepristone is unavailable, an individual can orally take a total of 12 tablets of mifepristone, ingesting four tablets at a time and waiting 30 minutes between doses. Misoprostol is $22-32 less expensive than mifepristone, though prices for both drugs vary by location.
Bata said both drugs have high efficacy rates. 
“Misoprostol is more expensive and less successful, and I think misoprostol and mifepristone is around 90% effective, and just misoprostol is around 83 to 90% effective,” Bata said.
Maggie McCormick (SOH ’25), who works on the advocacy team for HFC, said learning about self-managed abortions is becoming more important as the right to abortion becomes increasingly restricted across the country. 
“Even in states where it is legal, I’ve heard stories about how dangerous it is to walk in because of the people who stand outside and protest,” McCormick told The Hoya. “It’s definitely good to know that this is still a safe option.”
McCormick said she hopes to continue to help share information on how to seek out abortion pills, including through programs like Plan C, a public health initiative that combines research and advocacy. 
“How to find abortion pills for your specific location, that’s something that I want to inform more people about,” McCormick said. “Like the different websites where you can plug in your state and find out how much it will cost, if you can get it shipped to you, if you need to go somewhere else. All the information is right there.”

International relations and diplomacy experts discussed the past, present and future of relations between Russia, Ukraine and the United States at a virtual panel co-hosted by Georgetown’s Free Speech Project (FSP) and Future of the Humanities Project. 
The Nov. 14 event, entitled “Living with Putin: Russia and the West,” featured Corneliu Bjola, the head of the Oxford Digital Diplomacy Research Group; Susan Eisenhower, chair emeritus at the Eisenhower Institute; Ellen Ioanes, a foreign affairs reporter for Vox; and Katherine Lawlor, senior intelligence analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, a military affairs research group. The webinar was the 25th event in a monthly series hosted by the FSP and Future of Humanities Project called “Free Speech at the Crossroads: International Dialogues.”
John McCabe, program manager at the FSP, said while the FSP initiative focuses on First Amendment conditions in the United States, it is interconnected with international discourse.
 “The idea is that free speech as an issue has an international angle to it, where often First Amendment or free speech problems that we think are unique to the United States are actually a larger problem internationally,” McCabe told The Hoya.
Speakers at the event discussed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s motivations behind the military invasion of Ukraine that began Feb. 24, including his global and domestic perceptions. 
Putin cares about how he is perceived both in Russia and abroad, Ioanes said. 
“His reputation within Russia and to the Russian people, and how he comes off to them — that’s a really important thing to him as well, maybe equally as important or even more important than how he appears on the international stage,” Ioanes said at the event. “He depends on the Russian people to keep him in power.”
Speakers also discussed what post-war peace may look like in Russia. Bjola said that in order for peace to last, it can’t rest on easily reversible policies like ceasefires. 
“The question is what kind of peace — a fragile peace or an enduring peace,” Bjola said. “A fragile peace is one that you may conclude tomorrow with a ceasefire that can resume in the spring.”
Lawlor said fragile peace that freezes the war along its current front lines could further undermine Ukrainian sovereignty and harm Ukraine in the long term. 
“Peace sounds great, but who does that peace serve?” Lawlor said. “Ukraine also has to be empowered to make that decision, if we really believe in sovereignty. Ukraine’s sovereignty is the point of this war, and therefore it is not the role of the United States or of China or Russia to make decisions on at what point Ukraine draws the line for its own sovereignty.”
Eisenhower and other speakers also discussed the role of the United States in the international community, saying past examples of U.S. intervention, notably in Afghanistan, demonstrate an ineffective approach to foreign conflict.
“My heart hurts when I think about the way the United States of America left Afghanistan,” Eisenhower said at the event. “The United States of America needs to really sit down and have a hard think about some of the things we’ve done. We have to be in the business of trying to win friends and influence people in a positive way.”
In its handling of relations with Afghanistan and Iraq, which led to the U.S. starting wars in both states, Eisenhower said the U.S. has potentially created material for Putin’s propaganda campaigns.
Ioanes also said Putin often takes what the U.S. media reports on and uses it as propaganda to advance the ideas he wants to convey to the Russian public, though acknowledging this has not prevented her from executing her journalistic responsibilities.
“We know that things we say and things that we write are going to be used as propaganda tools,” Ioanes said. “Does that stop me from saying what is true? Does that keep me from talking to people and making sure that my audience is informed about what’s going on and what I personally am reading and hearing about? If we thought about that all the time, we would be completely paralyzed.”
McCabe said the aim of the webinar series is to promote as much free speech as possible.
“Our model is that more speech is always the best protocol,” McCabe said. “So, however we can get those conversations and important dialogues out there to the rest of the world and make people think in a more critical way about free speech and the First Amendment and how those issues stretch internationally, the better.”
Michael Scott, an event moderator and the director of the Future of the Humanities Project, an interdisciplinary initiative that addresses the humanities and public life, said attendees should consider the importance of recognizing the human consequences of the war in Ukraine.
“We shouldn’t forget that in a war, there are casualties, even as we are speaking, on both sides,” Scott said at the event. “I think in politics, we sometimes forget that.”
Looking ahead, Bjola said Russia’s downfall could come quickly and unexpectedly.
“For someone who grew up in an authoritarian country, what I can say is that from our side, authoritarian regimes look strong and impenetrable — until they’re not,” Bjola said. “They can collapse overnight. That’s the thing about authoritarian states.”

Georgetown University’s Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs hosted a conference to celebrate the legacy of Rev. Drew Christiansen, a professor of ethics and global human development who died in April 2022. 
The Nov. 14-15 event focused on Christiansen’s legacy of exploring the intersection of Catholic social teaching and the subjects of peacebuilding, just war, nuclear disarmament and environmental justice. Keynote speaker and Berkley Center fellow David Hollenbach discussed topics that aligned with Christiansen’s passions, including interreligious peacebuilding in the Middle East and ongoing challenges in nuclear arms control, alongside over 20 other speakers from universities across the United States.
Michael Kessler, the executive director of the Berkley Center, said the conference aimed to honor both Christiansen’s professional accomplishments and his personal character. 
“When our colleague Drew Christiansen passed away, we lost not only a beloved friend, but a scholar whose capacious mind, gentle spirit, and sheer range of expertise are demonstrated by the range of topics we will take up in the next two days,” Kessler wrote to The Hoya.
The first day of the conference focused on nuclear weapons, and speakers discussed the need for Catholic institutions to focus on divestment from indiscriminate weapons, or weapons whose effect cannot be contained to a specific military target. The following day centered on the Catholic Church’s role in facilitating environmental justice.
Hollenbach knew Christiansen after they attended Woodstock College and Yale University together, and said Christiansen’s mission to protect marginalized communities, including Christians in the Middle East, motivated his work. 
“He was committed to the promotion of justice and peace — he saw that as central to his work as a Jesuit Priest,” Hollenbach told The Hoya. “He was very deeply involved in peacebuilding and the promotion of justice.”
Christiansen’s ability to connect various interdisciplinary perspectives toward a common goal made his work noteworthy, according to Kessler. 
“Drew’s legacy was really the many friendships and work relationships he held across a vast number of institutions and networks,” Kessler said. “He brought together people from different sectors — such as nuclear threat issues, environmental justice, and peacemaking — into a common mission.”
Christiansen’s legacy is preserved by the scholars who participated in these discussions and furthered the mission of his academic work, according to Catholic University professor Maryann Cusimano Love. Cusimano Love first introduced the idea for the event alongside University of Notre Dame professor Gerard Powers. 
“We’ve talked about his contributions in the past, we’ve talked about their implications for the present on all of these policy issues,” Cusimano Love said at the event. “The point of this conference is how to take his legacy forward, what this legacy means going forward to the future.”
Cusimano Love said Christiansen’s philosophy emphasized the inclusion of a diverse range of differing beliefs.
“His concept of the normal imagination was that we had to imagine communities that include our adversaries,” Cusimano Love said. “Whether they are adversaries in war and peace or adversaries on different sides of the aisle or different political perspectives who have different ideas, we have to encounter them, engage them in dialogue.”
Forming these relationships, especially with ideological opponents, helps create innovative solutions for social problems and new ways for society to progress, according to Cusimano Love. 
“Out of these relationships of love and friendship would spring new and creative ideas for paths forward,” Cusimano Love said. “There wasn’t one path to peace. He would have had a short legacy if he thought there was just one path.”
Kessler said the Berkley Center intends to uphold the essence of Christiansen’s philosophy in its future projects.
“He worked across religious, national, and ethnic boundaries in a spirit of friendship and collaboration,” Kessler said. “All of our work at the center will endeavor to continue this spirit.”

U.S. Representative Ro Khanna (D-CA) discussed his economic vision for supporting U.S. working class individuals and families at an event hosted by the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service (GU Politics).
At the Nov. 16 event entitled “A Call for Economic Patriotism with Rep. Ro Khanna,” Khanna led with a statement in which he discussed his idea of economic patriotism, which involves legislation that promotes jobs for workers within the United States and also reforms social issues in the process.
Khanna said the outsourcing of labor and lack of industrial structures within the U.S. has been detrimental to workers.
“I believe we owe economic patriotism to the families who face massive deindustrialization,” Khanna said at the event. “Economic patriotism is a moonshot to rebuild America. It’s a moonshot to rebuild industry in this country.”
Khanna said modern technology will boost this economic rebuilding process.
“We can do this in every part of our country, and we can do it now in a way that is more achievable than ever before because of advanced technology –– the 3D printing and digital printing and manufacturing innovation and processes,” Khanna said. “It’s often cheaper and more productive and easier to make things in this country if we’re willing to make the investment.”
Khanna said the concept of economic patriotism involves three parts. The first part is government collaboration with the private sector, labor and educational institutions. 
Khanna said the CHIPS and Science Act, a law he helped to write that invests in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, directly benefits industries rather than simply subsidizing corporations.
“You don’t use one dollar of that money for CEO bonuses,” Khanna said. “You put that money into building new factories, in creating new jobs, in paying higher wages. While we come together in this country –– business and labor, late faith leaders and educational leaders –– we can build things and we can make things.”
Khanna said the second component of economic patriotism requires investing in the U.S. workforce, especially through education.
“To build a manufacturing base, we have to make the investment in vocational education,” Khanna said. “And by the way, we have to make the investment in free public college. Free public college is a patriotic investment; it’s a pro-jobs investment; it’s a pro-economic growth investment.”
The third part of Khanna’s vision is the notion that workers deserve better wages. Khanna said in 2018 he and Senator Bernie Sanders (D-VT) introduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies Act –– or the Stop BEZOS Act –– which seeks to tax large employers that rely on certain federal benefits for their employees.
Khanna said it is important to ensure a livable wage for America’s workers and to prevent organizations from taking advantage of the working class.
“If you’re bagging groceries, you should make enough to be able to buy groceries,” Khanna said. “If you are working for one of the richest companies in the world, you shouldn’t need to rely on food stamps. We said if you’re not going to pay a livable wage, then you need to pay the taxes for the public benefits that taxpayers are paying.”
Khanna also discussed the risk of Congress being driven by dark money. 
“If we don’t stop the dark money influencing Congress, we’re going to continue to have policy driven by the big oil giants,” Khanna said. “One of the biggest amendments we need is a 28th Amendment that says ‘Stop the private money in Congress, and allow the regulation of private money in Congress.’ That’s what’s going to get rid of the big oil companies.”
Khanna said economic patriotism is also interconnected with reforms within issues such as healthcare, education, childcare and climate change.
“You want to bring jobs and manufacturing, then invest in healthcare,” Khanna said. “The arguments are far more complicated, if we really want to grow our economy, than just the mantra of tax cuts. It’s going to take far more, but I think people are ready for real solutions.”
According to Khanna, young people such as the event attendees have the power to address these social and economic issues.
“Your generation can rebuild this country,” Khanna said. “Your generation can tackle climate change. Your generation can inspire this country to get back on its feet and to tackle the biggest challenges facing the world. It’s an exciting time to go into politics.”
Khanna said that ultimately, economic patriotism will strengthen democracy.
“Economic patriotism is not just about economics. It’s not just about building our economy. It’s about strengthening our democracy,” he said. “If we do not work together, if we do not prosper together, if we do not build together, then we will not reach the goals of a multiracial, multiethnic democracy.”

Camber Vincent (SFS ’24) and Alyssa Hirai (SFS ’24) won the election for president and vice president of the Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA). 
Vincent and Hirai earned 55% of the 1,303 votes cast by students from Nov. 10-12. Chijioke Achebe (SFS ’25) and Devon Pasieka (MSB ’25) received 27% of the votes and Spencer Woodall (MSB, SFS ’24) and Anya Caraiani (SFS ’24) won the other 18% of votes. Turnout for the election was 18.5%, according to the GUSA Election Commission. 
Vincent and Hirai campaigned on their institutional experience in GUSA and plan to continue working on projects such as the Metro U-Pass, which gives students free access to all WMATA transportation services; the Collegiate Readership Program, which aims to give students free access to several major news publications; the InterHall council, a student ​​advocacy board whose goal is to improve residence life; and more. 
Vincent said the relationships Hirai and he have already established with administrators and student leaders will make their transition into their roles easy after they take office Dec. 4.
“A lot of groundwork that usually has to take place the first couple of months into the executive term has already been laid, allowing us to hit the ground running on various projects and focus on other important work that comes with the executive positions,” Vincent wrote to The Hoya.
In the GUSA Senate elections, Rob Arzano (COL ’24), Joshua Bernard-Pearl (SFS ’25), María Victoria -Almeida Vazquez (SFS ’25) and incumbent Manahal Fazal (SFS ’24) were elected to the four available at-large seats. 
Meriam Ahmad (COL ’26), George Currie (COL ’26), Dylan Davis (COL ’26), Seth Edwards (COL ’26), Rhea Iyer (COL ’26), Hilary Orozco (COL ’26) and Andrew Wong (SFS ’26) won the Class of 2026 senate seats. 
The senate confirmed their new members and elected Fazal as speaker and senator Alicia Gopal (COL ’25) as vice speaker of the senate, respectively, at a Nov. 13 Senate meeting. They also held elections to determine the chairs and vice chairs of the Policy and Advocacy Committee (PAC), Finance and Appropriations Committee (FinApp), Ethics and Oversight Committee (E&O) and FinApp liaisons and adjuncts, who coordinate policy with other committees. 
Ahmad said during her term she will work to ensure GUSA promotes the work of other student organizations. 
“There are so many groups on campus advocating for workers’ rights, against discrimination, and for so many other causes, and I hope GUSA can be a platform to amplify those advocacy efforts,” Ahmad wrote to The Hoya. “I know that GUSA doesn’t have a great reputation in the student body right now, and I hope that my fellow senators and I can change that with our advocacy.”
Despite losing, Pasieka said she and Achebe hope they can continue to make positive changes on campus.
“Obviously we were in it to win, but we’re grateful for the opportunity to talk with so many Georgetown students about what really matters to them,” Pasieka wrote to The Hoya. “We’re excited to use those conversations to make a difference even without the executive title.” 
Woodall and Cariani did not respond to The Hoya’s requests for comment.
Following the opening of the polls, both The Hoya and The Voice rescinded their respective editorials that had endorsed the Vincent-Hirai ticket and cited a lack of sufficient time to investigate Hirai’s involvement in Georgetown’s chapter of Network of enlightened Women (NeW), a conservative women’s association. On Nov. 14, NeW hosted Riley Gaines, a swimmer who has spoken against the inclusion of transgender women in women’s sports. 
Hirai told The Hoya and The Voice that she is not and has never been a member of NeW. 
Hirai did not attend the speaker event and denied any involvement in the club beyond attending social events hosted by NeW, most recently on Sept. 18. 
“I, along with Camber, support transgender rights on campus and will commit to communicating that to our community through my actions as vice president,” Hirai wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Vincent said his administration will work to support transgender students, including by pressuring the Office of Residential Living to create more inclusive housing policies. 
“Currently, the university chooses to apply policy on a case by case basis,” Vincent wrote. “We would like them to include explicit statements that students who identify as transgender, non-binary, or gender fluid will be assured housing with a roommate of any gender identity of their choosing or access to a single upon request.”
This article was updated on 11/18 to correct the name of the vice-speaker of the GUSA senate from Joshua Bernard-Pearl to Alicia Gopal.

November 18, 2022 by Annie Kane 1 Comment 
The Republican Party is about to be at war with itself, journalist Maggie Haberman told Georgetown University students and community members at an event co-hosted by the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service (GU Politics) and the Georgetown Journalism Program.
The event, titled “Political Pageturners: ‘Confidence Man’ with Maggie Haberman,” featured Haberman, a New York Times senior political reporter and CNN contributor, in conversation with Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94), the executive director of GU Politics. At the event Haberman spoke about her new book “Confidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of American,” which details former president Donald Trump’s rise to power and what it reveals about the nature of American democracy. 
According to Haberman, Trump’s consistent and public lying, which created alternate realities for himself and his followers, defined her time covering the former president.
“I think that the fundamental challenge of covering Donald Trump is that none of us has covered a political figure who lies about things big and small the way he does,” Haberman said at the event. “That’s the big challenge.”
Despite receiving backlash from the Republican Party after many candidates he endorsed lost in the 2022 midterm elections, on Nov. 15, Trump formally announced that he will run for president in 2024 during a speech at his Mar-a-Lago Club. 
Given her experience extensively interviewing the former president and his allies, Haberman spoke on her predictions about Trump’s 2024 presidential run just a day before his announcement. 
Haberman said she expects Trump’s platform will be centered on election denialism, despite a lack of any evidence that there was widespread voter fraud during the 2020 election.
“I think he will double down on the way that we’ve seen him over and over again, I think he’s going to have to continue to say rigged, fake election about 2020,” Haberman said. “Because that’s just what he does. What’s been striking is how many people in his orbit, which is almost all of them, have been asking him to avoid kicking off a campaign, and he just won’t do it, he’s completely settled.”
In “Confidence Man,” Haberman tracks not only Trump’s presidency, but also his rise to cultural prominence in New York City through the political and real estate scenes. Despite his many failed business ventures, Trump’s public persona as a successful businessman was galvanized by his reality television show “The Apprentice,” which, running from 2004 to 2015, depicted him as a jetsetting and divisive boss. 
According to Haberman, many people close to Trump say he knows he would not have been elected president without “The Apprentice” because of the image it helped curate of him.
“I asked him the question: would you be president without the apprentice?” Haberman said. “And I think he said it was a good question. But I know from private conversations with people he knows the answer is yes.”
In 2016, Trump gained supporters who resented Barack Obama’s presidency and were still struggling economically after the 2008 financial crisis. 
According to Haberman, the voters who helped elect Trump in 2016 continue to back him because he aligns himself against establishment politics and speaks to a sense of victimhood.
“He fights,” Haberman said. “A lot of voters felt very angry for disparate reasons as backlash to the first Black president getting elected. Some of it is post-2008 fiscal crisis, which I don’t think people can understand how much that accelerated an era of mistrust in this country that Trump then accelerated further. So somebody who’s willing to stand up for you and say, ‘You’re right, your suspicions are right, they’re out to get you,’ that feels really good to a lot of voters.”
When asked by a student at the event about how the press can most accurately cover Trump in the future, Haberman said journalists must continue to work to contextualize what he says in order to avoid printing false statements. 
“What we need to do is contextualize him,” Haberman said. “And I think the media has really adjusted its aperture to deal with the issue about how we’ve never covered a candidate before who says things that are not true at the clip that he does, the main one being the election in 2020.” 
Haberman said she believes that, unless another candidate such as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis proves strong against him, Trump will receive the 2024 presidential nomination from the Republican Party.
“I think that the party is pretty divided,” Haberman said. “And I think the party is about to really be at war with itself, particularly in the Senate, and then aspects of the House leadership. I still think Donald Trump is the front runner for the nomination in the Republican Party, and nothing I have seen has suggested otherwise.”

The Georgetown University McDonough School of Business (MSB) will expand its Yellow Ribbon Program (YRP), a scholarship that helps veterans ineligible for the GI Bill pay for higher education. 
Starting August 2023, the MSB will increase the maximum funds awarded by YRP from $16,000 to $20,000 per student, which will cover the complete annual cost of full-time tuition for the majority of McDonough’s graduate programs. The expansion will also remove limits on the number of students who are eligible to qualify for the scholarship each year. 
YRP recipient Creigh Greensmith (MBA ’24, LAW ’24) said balancing being a father alongside his pursuit of a higher education would have been impossible without the assistance of a scholarship. 
“For me, the Yellow Ribbon program was critical to my choice to return to school after serving for seven years in the Navy,” Greensmith wrote to The Hoya. “I have three young children. Returning to school full-time required finding a school that understood my position and would be willing to help.”
Increasing access to higher education through scholarships is an important way for Georgetown to cultivate a student body representative of diverse backgrounds, including veterans, MSB Dean Paul Almeida said. 
“Here at McDonough, we are proud to host a growing veteran and military-connected population in our programs who continue to enrich our community and bring important perspectives to our classrooms,” Almeida wrote to The Hoya.
Almeida said the MSB made it a priority to increase graduate-level YRP scholarships to further remove financial barriers to student veterans seeking a Georgetown education. 
Sam Justen (SFS ’24), a member of Georgetown’s Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) program, said he is proud to see Georgetown’s administration take steps to acknowledge the sacrifice of military-affiliated students. 
“I think it’s really good that Georgetown is enabling veterans to obtain higher education and move up the socioeconomic ladder on account of their service,” Justen told The Hoya. 
The YRP is essential for empowering low-income veterans to obtain undergraduate and graduate degrees, according to Wesley Wilson, director of Georgetown’s Military and Veterans Resource Center.
“The Yellow Ribbon Program is a vital resource for ensuring military-connected students can access a Georgetown education,” Wilson wrote to The Hoya. “Without the YRP, private universities like Georgetown would be financially inaccessible for many military-connected students.”
According to Wilson, expanding the YRP is an important part in the MSB’s mission to support marginalized communities on campus. 
“Military-connected students are more likely to be students of color, first-generation and hail from modest socioeconomic backgrounds,” Wilson wrote. “I’m proud that MSB will be more accessible to those who have served, and that Georgetown will benefit from having more military-connected students as members of our campus community.”
Over 60% of enlisted service members and veterans are first-generation college students, according to a 2021 report by the University Business. Additionally, veterans of color are four times more likely to be first-generation students than white veteran students. 
ROTC member Noah Money (SON ’24) said that while improving YRP is a step in the right direction, he’d still like to see more done. 
“I think it’s great that the university is doing more to support veterans taking full advantage of the post-9/11 GI Bill, but I think the university could still do more to support veterans, especially those outside of the MSB,” Money wrote to The Hoya. “I would still like to see more support of military-affiliated students, namely ROTC.”
Almeida said expanding the YRP is one way for the MSB to recognize the contributions of veterans on Georgetown’s campus. 
“Our veteran community has valiantly served to protect the freedoms we so often take for granted, and the YRP scholarships are just one of the many ways we aim to honor their service to our country,” Almeida wrote.

Black-owned restaurants across the Washington, D.C.-Maryland-Virginia (DMV) area participated in the fifth annual DMV Black Restaurant Week, providing discounts and diverse cuisine to customers. 
The week honoring Black-owned restaurants, which was held Nov. 6 through 13, promoted several food venues, including Melange, Queen Mother’s, All Set and Moi Moi which feature a variety of cuisines. The restaurants offered reduced prices for customers in honor of Black Restaurant Week, which has become an annual tradition since it launched in 2018. 
Howsoon Cham, chef and owner of Farragut North’s high-end West African restaurant Moi Moi, said that DMV Black Restaurant Week encourages people to try cuisines like his Gambian dishes that they have never experienced before. 
“I think that was the main idea,” Cham said to The Hoya. “This gives them an opportunity to go try concepts of food that they’ve never heard of, seen of or even tasted in their lifetime, because I know my concept, my food, I can tell you one thing — you’re not going to go anywhere and find it. You might find something similar to it, but it’s not going to be like how I make mine.”
Cham said for Black Restaurant Week, Moi Moi served a glass of wine, an appetizer, an entree and a dessert for a discounted price of $65. 
The restaurant advertised Black Restaurant Week on their Instagram page and on their website to increase publicity.
“The restaurant week was good for great advertisement for awareness and you know people coming from all over the world and trying it,” Cham said. “And they love it, because it’s different.” 
Erin Tucker, director of Georgetown’s Global Hospitality Leadership Master’s program, Furard Tate, the owner of Inspire DMV Hospitality, and Andra Johnson, managing partner at Serenata, founded DMV Black Restaurant Week in 2018 to promote local Black-owned food venues. 
This year’s DMV Black Restaurant Week promoted a diverse set of Black businesses, including restaurants with pre-fixed three-course meal options, more casual take-out spots and cafes, food trucks and bars. The 2022 theme, “Reshaping Our Community Through Ownership and Luxury,” highlighted Black entrepreneurs who are founding luxury businesses and expanding them for the purpose of catering to underserved communities.
Cham said that the week is impactful because minority-owned restaurants often do not have the same support as other restaurants. 
“Those that are involved were lucky enough to get exposed to have them grow their business, because at the end of the day, minorities don’t get the same support as our counterparts, both financially and marketing and other stuff,” Cham said. “So it was a pleasure and it was good for us to have this kind of support.” 
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser commemorated this year’s DMV Black Restaurant Week with an announcement awarding seven new businesses in Wards 7 and 8, which consist predominantly of Black neighborhoods, support through a new wave of $7 million to the District’s Food Access Fund, an initiative Bowser started in 2021 to eliminate food inequities. 
Bowser said it is important to simultaneously uplift Black-owned businesses and restaurants throughout the District. 
“The Food Access Fund is a fantastic example of how the government can work with local entrepreneurs to bring much-needed resources and amenities to the community,” Bowser said in a press release. “One way to celebrate DMV Black Restaurant Week is to go out and support Black-owned businesses in DC.” 
Market 7, an upcoming marketplace that plans to feature Black-owned businesses in Ward 7, received a grant through the Food Access Fund during DMV Black Restaurant Week. 
Mary Blackford, the founder of Market 7, said people in Wards 7 and 8 face increased health issues from conditions like diabetes and heart disease because of a lack of access to fresh food.
“We are so grateful to the Bowser administration for spearheading this, because it’s important to these sort of communities who are long-standing underserved communities in terms of food access, because it really does impact the lived life experience of those who are not having access to fresh and sustainable food,” Blackford told The Hoya. “So we are trying to combat that.”
According to Blackford, Market 7 will use the grant money for financial support as it constructs its food hall, which will feature a community grocer, a cafe space, a hydroponic bar and several eateries. 
Blackford said she champions the work that the DMV Black Restaurant Week founders are doing to promote Black-owned businesses. 
“Continue to support Black Restaurant Week and support Black-owned food businesses, Black businesses period, all year round,” Blackford said. “Continue to make sure you are pouring into spaces that have been marginalized in a way that takes away opportunities and resources from communities of color, particularly Black communities.”

The Fall 2022 Georgetown Startup Accelerator (GSA) cohort presented their early-stage startup companies to Georgetown students, faculty and staff at this year’s edition of Demo Day. 
Demo Day was hosted Nov. 8 by Georgetown Entrepreneurship, a program within the McDonough School of Business (MSB), as the annual culmination of the GSA program, a entrepreneurship-based cohort. At the event, led by the founding director of the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative Jeff Reid and with opening remarks from co-founder and chief mission officer of Health-Ade Kombucha Daina Trout (NHS ’03), 10 companies founded by Georgetown graduates showcased startups they had worked on over the course of the program. 
The 10 startup companies in the Fall 2022 cohort were AI Priori, Sweet M’lk, DGo-On, Keep Company, Budeli, Parrotfish, Power & Pearls, Ridge, Student Global Ambassador Program and Toperty. 
At the event, each member of this year’s GSA cohort shared a four-minute pitch of their company. Each company had a distinct mission, including female empowerment, environmental sustainability and nutrition in schools. The pitches were each pre-recorded and paired with a slideshow presentation to better represent the goals of the company and the progress it had made. 
After each founder presented their pitches, breakout rooms were created for each company and attendees were able to move throughout each room to speak to the founder and ask questions regarding their startup.
Emily Yu (SFS ’01), founder of AI Priori, an information technology company focusing on AI data service, presented the first pitch. 
According to Yu, the company’s data collection programs will benefit community-based projects. 
“To help foundations make more effective and evidence-based decisions, we’ve created an online platform to help program officers review their text-based documents and help them find the most relevant information on their most commonly asked questions, like what helped a program succeed, or what was an obstacle?” Yu said at the event. “This is particularly helpful when it comes to parsing community stories and other qualitative information.”
Julian Uribe (LAW ’20), co-founder of Toperty, a Colombian mortgage financial technology company that seeks to make homeownership more accessible in Latin America, delivered the final pitch of the event. 
Toperty will help people in Latin America navigate an expensive and daunting housing market, Uribe said.  
“So how do we help? First, we buy properties below market price using technology and through partnership with local developers,” Uribe said at the event. “Then, Maria chooses her dream house, she moves in, and she starts paying market rent plus some extra equity contributions, so she’s gonna be buying homeownership from us over time. And after three to five years, when she reaches 20% homeownership, she finishes the purchase through a traditional mortgage.”
In his opening remarks, Reid said Demo Day serves as evidence of the accelerator program’s growth throughout the past five years.
“So about five years ago, we made a strategic decision to support alumni as they build their companies,” Reid said at the event. “We now have the Georgetown Venture Lab, which is located in Washington D.C. and has had over 100 companies as its members over its four-year history, and a few years ago, we knew, we recognized, that there were so many alumni entrepreneurs who are not located in D.C., who we might be able to serve through virtual programming.”
Trout said that she and her co-founders transitioned from the pharmaceutical industry into entrepreneurship in order to have more innovative careers. 
“We were feeling unfulfilled,” Trout said at the event. “We were feeling like we had more to give, we wanted to build something we could be proud of, we were feeling incredibly itchy to start something on our own.” 
Trout said budding entrepreneurs must take a leap of faith into the market in order to test the viability of their product.  
“Get in the game,” Trout said. “I think too much planning can hold you back and I see it all the time with founders that are trying to perfect something, and meanwhile the game is being played out there.”

Georgetown Individuals Vocal and Energetic for Service (GIVES) and Vital Vittles (Vittles) are partnering to organize an on-campus food drive for Thanksgiving.
Students and community members are encouraged to donate nonperishable food, including beans, lentils, canned fish, pasta, peanut butter, cereal and canned fruits and vegetables that will go directly to the Capital Area Food Bank through Nov. 30. GIVES, an on-campus student organization dedicated to performing acts of service within the Georgetown University community and beyond, coordinated with Vital Vittles, the flagship storefront of student-run business the Corp, for a central spot for members of the Georgetown community to purchase and donate food for the drive. 
Reona Pereira (SOH ’23), president of GIVES, said GIVES decided to launch the food drive with Vittles in the spirit of the Thanksgiving holiday and to provide an opportunity for Georgetown students to support the Washington, D.C. community.
“GIVES wanted to put together a random act of kindness for the month of November in theme with Thanksgiving and giving back to the community, which is why we decided to organize a food drive on campus,” Pereira wrote to The Hoya. “We want to engage students to participate in random acts of kindness and also to perform random acts of kindness for our peers.”
According to Pereira, GIVES specifically chose to donate proceeds to Capital Area Food Bank given the organization’s mission and its care for families across the District. 
Pereira said the food drive has thus been very successful, filling over six boxes of food to donate in only four to five days, in part due to efforts on the part of Vittles to boost donation efforts.
“We really appreciate all the work Vittles and the Corp has done to encourage people to donate,” Pereira wrote. “We wanted to partner with Vittles given their structure and the goods they sell. Our hope was that students would buy a couple extra snacks when they do their own snack runs to donate to the drive.” 
Joshua LaRock (MSB ’23), director of Vital Vittles, said when GIVES approached Vittles regarding their food drive idea, it made sense to partner with the group as a part of the Corp’s philanthropic efforts. 
“GIVES originated the food drive and reached out to utilize Vittles’ space for pickups,” LaRock wrote to The Hoya. “We felt that as the largest convenience store on campus, it was a perfect fit and aligned with our mission of ‘students serving students.’”
LaRock said this effort follows up other efforts from the Corp to further the organization’s mission such as Vittles’ organization of teams in the Washington, D.C. 5K for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and the BellRinger ride for the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center.
Abbey Swartzwelder (COL ’25), a GIVES marketing deputy, said the food drive is a simple way for students to spread kindness in the District in accordance with GIVES’s mission. 
“To me, Vittles is like a hub for Georgetown students, and many of them will visit it at least once a week for food or other essentials,” Swartzwelder wrote to The Hoya. “This makes it a great place for a donation box because we knew there would be lots of people stopping by.”
Daniel Flynn (COL ’23), Vittles’ general manager, said that while Vittles has helped organize food drives in the past, this specific fundraising effort has been its most successful. 
“We hosted similar food drives around the holiday season in the past, but this is our first time partnering with GIVES — and it has been our most successful drive to date,” Flynn wrote to The Hoya. “Partnering with other philanthropic organizations on campus maximizes our impact on the Hilltop and the DMV community. We are so glad that we can utilize our resources for such a great cause.”
LaRock said students’ willingness to become involved with the drive has helped perpetuate its success thus far. “None of this would be possible without the generosity of the student-body, faculty, and customers we serve on a daily basis,” LaRock wrote. “We are grateful for your support.”
