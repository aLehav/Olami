The Georgetown University Police Department and university officials are investigating graffiti of swastikas in Village C West and the removal of Muslim and Hindu flyers from chaplain-in-residence bulletin boards earlier this week as bias-related incidents.
VCW resident Sarah Hirshorn (COL ’20) said she discovered one of the two swastikas scratched into the interior walls of an elevator Tuesday morning. She first reported the incident to the building’s community director, Kenny Steelman, and later filed a bias report at his suggestion.
“I did not feel attacked or unsafe, more just uncomfortable as a Jewish student that there was someone who lived in my building, or took it upon themselves to enter my building, to go out of their way to make a resident feel uncomfortable,” Hirshorn wrote in an email to The Hoya.
GUPD Chief Jay Gruber said the vandalism was reported to the department at about 4:30 p.m. Tuesday. The swastikas were painted over by Wednesday morning.
Gruber said GUPD is actively investigating the anti-Semitic vandalism and had no suspects as of last night. Gruber declined to comment on what the investigation entails.
“We generally do not discuss or disclose our investigative techniques or methods,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Interim Vice President for Mission and Ministry Rev. Howard Gray and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson informed the university community about the incidents in an email Wednesday.
“As a Catholic and Jesuit university, we are committed to fostering a community that is welcoming to people of all faiths and that values understanding, tolerance, inclusion and respect. Acts of hate are unacceptable and antithetical to the values of our community,” Gray and Olson wrote.
Two separate bias reports were also filed regarding incidents of Muslim and Hindu flyers being ripped down and vandalized from chaplain-in-residence bulletin boards, according to Gray and Olson’s email.
The bias reports were filed through the university’s anonymous online bias reporting system. Gruber could not confirm details of the timing and location of these incidents, as they were not reported to GUPD.
According to New South Hall’s Chaplain-in-Residence Brahmachari Vrajvihari Sharan, one of the hall’s bulletin boards was vandalized.
“I returned from a trip to London over spring break to find that the Muslim and Hindu flyers were missing from my Chaplain-in-Residence display,” Sharan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I urge the perpetrators and those who would trivialize such deplorable acts to examine whether these actions will better or worsen the state of our society.”
Georgetown University Student Association Vice President Jessica Andino (COL ’18) said GUSA is concerned by any bias-related incident.
“We are deeply concerned by the swastika sign and other bias-related incidents that have recently come to light,” Andino wrote in an email to The Hoya. “GUSA stands by any Hoyas that have been personally attacked through these hate incidents, whether it be a member of the Jewish, Muslim, Black, Hindu, Latinx, or LGBTQ community.”
Andino and Mack plan to meet with Gruber tonight to discuss how to improve student safety and prevent future vandalism.
Director for Jewish Life Rabbi Rachel Gartner condemned the incidents.
“Cowardly expressions of hate like the ones we’ve been seeing deserve no less than our disdain, condemnation, and investigation,” Gartner wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I am proud of how seriously and expertly the university has been handling them, and how sensitively university staff and officials have been reaching out to those targeted. And my heart is warmed and encouraged by the ways students are reaching out to one another as well.”
In light of the incidents, Gartner called on members of the community to self-examine and reflect on their own implicit biases.
“At the same time, as we stand together against such vivid and visible expressions of hatred, my hope is that we also continue to look inward into the unexamined or implicit biases that also may be operative in each of us, and are communicated in more subtle and insipid ways,” Gartner wrote.
Director for Muslim Life Imam Yahya Hendi said members of the Georgetown community should speak out against hateful acts.
“Our campus is a beautiful one, and has no room for hate or exclusivity,” Hendi said. “My Muslim tradition teaches us to celebrate diversity, care for our neighbors and coexist with mutual respect and understanding. Hence, I reject all forms of hate directed at any Hoya, and call on us to treat any attack on one as an attack on all.”

Most likely a hoax.   
A lot of minorities enjoy playing victims manufacturing hate crimes in order to get attention and secure resource transfers.  As to taking down posters, this happens to everyone’s poster.  All that post-election Muslim harassment stuff turned out to be fake and the news reported that all those bomb threats recently were done by . . . wait for it . . . a Jew.
A bit ironic too how a week ago Mack was hysterical and claiming harassment for some posters promoting White identity and how GUPD opened an investigation.  But somehow, posters taken down promoting Black or Latino or Muslim or Hindu or LGBTQ identity is a hate crime.
Hate crime: Putting up posters promoting White identity and taking down posters promoting non-White identity.
Not a hate crime: Putting up posters promoting non-White identity groups and taking down posters promoting White identity.
Interesting to this quote: “GUSA stands by any Hoyas that have been personally attacked through these hate incidents, whether it be a member of the Jewish, Muslim, Black, Hindu, Latinx, or LGBTQ community.”  
How come Whites or Christians weren’t mentioned?  Hmm . . . .   
They’re Hoyas too, right?  
Does Mack and Andino not stand by the victims of hate crimes and harassment who are White?  If not, why not?

In response to President Donald Trump’s executive orders on immigration, the Catholic Church should welcome refugees and immigrants, according to a panel of speakers Monday evening in Gaston Hall.
The panel, titled “Refugees and Immigrants: Welcoming the Stranger in Tough Times,”  was hosted by the Georgetown Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life and moderated by the initiative’s director John Carr.
The six panelists included Georgetown President Emeritus and Jesuit Refugee Service Interim Executive Director Fr. Leo O’Donovan, S.J., and Catholic Community Services of Salt Lake City Immigration and Refugee Resettlement Director Aden Batar, a Somalian refugee.
Panelist Bishop Ricardo Ramirez said the Catholic Church has been and remains committed to welcoming everyone.
“Moses and his people were migrants, they fled Egypt and they went to the promised land,” Ramirez said.
Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles President Alfonso Aguilar said he believes immigrants make the United States more American by instilling values of hope and freedom. Despite this, he said the United States still needs to maintain border security amid immigration growth.
“We do have to address the issue of security. I listen to the theological discussions, I believe in the refugee program, but the bishops also talk about the importance of border security,” Aguilar said. “We have to balance being a welcoming nation with ensuring the security of our territory. It’s a difficult balance.”
Aguilar, who criticized Trump’s rhetoric in the primaries, said he supported Trump’s immigration proposals during the general election because he believed in his ability to secure the border and reform the immigration system.
“In the Hispanic community and in other immigrant communities, the perception is that Republicans are bad, Democrats are good. I think it’s a very complicated issue,” Aguilar said. “I did criticize Donald Trump during the primary, but on immigration I actually ended up supporting Donald Trump. I am looking at the end goal to bring people out of the shadows and really reform our immigration system.”
Ashley Feasley, who serves as director of policy for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops Office of Migration Policy and Public Affairs, said she felt those who opposed Trump’s policies, especially on immigration, should voice their opinions to enact change.
“What is really important is that we use our voice in this time period,” Feasley said. “That you, as citizens, say to your local lawmaker that you are against these executive orders and that you want your lawmaker, whether it’s your senator or your House of Representative member to vote against these bills.”
As a Mexican Georgetown student without documentation, Luis Gonzalez (COL ’19) said he appreciates the university’s efforts to support students without documentation.
“I am undocumented and I am unafraid,” Gonzalez said. “The reason why I say that I am unafraid is because I have an institution like Georgetown that is supportive of undocumented students. We have a university that has partnered with Catholic institutions to provide legal services for its undocumented student population.”
Despite the uncertain fate of immigrants in the United States, Ramirez said that if people of faith stand together, they will persevere.
“The last thing I want to say is that there is hope. I have hope especially that comes from our Catholic communities,” Ramirez said.

Planned renovations to the Leavey Center this summer potentially pose major changes for the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union and Students of Georgetown, Inc. storefronts, according to leaders of the two student-run organizations.
The university is planning renovations that include construction in the bookstore, Sellinger Lounge, the north corridor and Hoya Court areas of the Leavey Center to expand the bookstore, according to Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh.
The renovations are expected to take place from May 13 until September 2017.
The Hoya reported Feb. 28 that Uncommon Grounds would move to within the university bookstore on the second floor of the Leavey Center, with an exit onto the Leavey Esplanade.
The blueprints for the new UG show a rectangular space with doors leading into the second floor of Barnes & Noble and a staircase to the new location and seating areas.
The move is part of a larger expansion of the bookstore into Sellinger Lounge. Pugh said the construction will seek to avoid The Corp and GUASFCU storefronts.
“Construction will be limited to the bookstore, Sellinger Lounge, north corridor and Hoya Court areas in Leavey. The design and construction team has worked closely with the Corp during planning stages of the project,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya.
However, Corp CEO Melina Hsiao (COL ’18) and GUASFCU CEO Rupert Kingshott (MSB ’18) said the changes could affect traffic flow in Sellinger and the Leavey Center, affecting GUASFCU and Corp storefronts UG and Vital Vittles.
Hsiao said the move of UG presents an exciting but uncertain change for the organization.
“It’s really exciting in some ways, and a little bit nerve-wracking; it’s going to be a major change to the flow of traffic in the Leavey Center, and that is likely going to be a major change to our business,” Hsiao said. “It is going to be interesting to see how that works out.”
Kingshott said although the change will not help GUASFCU’s business, the burden is on the credit union to cater its services to Georgetown students.
“If I could make it not happen, that would be great, but I am not too concerned about it,” Kingshott said. “In the end, we are here to serve Georgetown. We make the financial lives of Georgetown students easier, and the burden should be on us to find them, not on them to find us.”
Hsiao said she was concerned that Vital Vittles might suffer as a result of the construction.
“Also, for Vittles, it will be a little bit of a concern post-construction with part of the Leavey Center so shiny and brand-new that no one wants to walk over toward Vittles. That could also be a hit to some of our business,” Hsiao said.
Kingshott said because students usually plan trips to the GUASFCU office, slight inconveniences should not deter them from banking there.
“Our business model is not so much about foot traffic. It is more about us presenting our message,” Kingshott said. “For us, you basically go for a specific thing, whether it is a loan, or even just to make a withdrawal. Because of that, it will not really affect us.”
Pugh said that the results of the new Leavey Center will not noticeably affect GUASFCU or Vital Vittles.
“GUASFCU and Vital Vittles impact is minimal and limited to construction activities that will occur in the designated retail areas,” Pugh wrote.
Hsiao assured the Corp is collaborating with the university to continue to promote Vital Vittles.
“We are working with the university to get signage to promote the new UG and pointing out that Vittles is ‘around this corner’ and ‘down the hall,’” Hsiao said.
Hsiao said UG’s transition upstairs to the Leavey Esplanade might attract new audiences from different locations than before.
“I think that it will be a really different flow of traffic into UG. Being up on Leavey Esplanade, maybe we will get more people coming over from MSB or the hospital,” Hsiao said.
Hsiao said she is concerned students could shift their business to Starbucks on the first floor of the Leavey Center. However, Hsiao said she hoped UG maintains a culture that will retain students’ favor regardless.
“I wonder whether people will go upstairs to UG or down the hall to Starbucks. I think that is a little bit of a concern,” Hsiao said. “It will be a new space, and I hope that UG is creating a welcoming environment that people want to hang out in anyway, so they will seek that out.”
According to Hsiao, the construction itself will likely not have a significant impact on business for UG since business operates far slower for The Corp from June to August.
Hsiao said The Corp’s main goal vis-à-vis the new construction is to ensure that all Corp locations in the Leavey Center remain integral to students’ daily lives on the Hilltop.
“How do we find the best way to make going to UG or Vittles part of the daily life and routine of incoming students? That is true of every year, but this year in particular, because we might be losing some of the business from people for whom it is already part of their daily routine,” Hsiao said.
Kingshott said that GUASFCU would ultimately bear responsibility for its own success despite any problems that arise from the new construction.
“It is just one of those things that happens, and you roll with it, because in the end it is up to us,” Kingshott said.

Skeptical says 
March 26, 2017 at 12:43 am
This headline is misleading. Makes it sound like both clubs are very concerned/potentially oppose the construction, which is clearly not the case. The actual quotes from the article do express some trepidation from Hsiao (which notably contradicts the way The Hoya portrayed the Corp’s supposedly very excited stance about the new UG) but Kingshott hardly sounds concerned, saying students will come to GUAFSCU anyway and it’s the club’s responsibility to adapt to changes.

The Georgetown University Student Association senate’s Finance and Appropriations Committee Chair Owen Hayes (COL ’18) has proposed a $41 increase in the annual student activities fee, which would be implemented if approved by a campuswide referendum.
The proposed increase from $159 to $200 per year was suggested by Hayes during both a GUSA senate meeting March 13 and a Finance and Appropriations meeting March 14.
Currently, the student activities fee, which each Georgetown student must pay at the beginning of each academic year, is scaled to national inflation, amounting to $159 during the 2016-17 school year.
GUSA President Kamar Mack (COL ’19), who cited affordability as a central issue in his campaign, said he opposes raising the student activities fee because it would effectively increase the cost of attendance for students.
“Regardless of what the final dollar amount is, there will always be more need. Organizations can always put up more programming; there can always be more financial support,” Mack said. “We are always hesitant to implement policies that would make the cost of attendance higher for students.”
Hayes said his Fin/App Committee experience has shown him that student groups on campus lack the necessary funding to organize events and run programs.
“It has become apparent that there is a fundamental gap between the amount of programming that student groups are looking to put on and the amount of funds there are available to facilitate that programming,” Hayes wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Hayes said he reached the $200 figure after analyzing data from Fin/App Committee records and emphasized he believes the current student activities fee is insufficient to fund the number of student groups active on campus when compared to the funding available to students at peer institutions.
“More conversations can and should be had about what the exact appropriate number for the fee is, but as it stands it is definitively too low and raising it to $200 would not only serve the purposes listed above, but would also bring us closer in line with our peer institutions, many of whom have student activities fees, or their equivalents, that are well above that $200 amount,” Hayes wrote.
Mack said not raising the fee allows students to choose what they wish to pay for.
“Under the status quo, we are giving the students the choice to spend their $41 where they so please, and so students who are not involved in clubs then have the freedom to decide where that money goes,” Mack said.
Hayes said neither students involved in student groups nor those who are not involved would benefit from the hike.
“It funds hallmark events put on by the Georgetown Program Board like Mr. Georgetown and the Spring Concert,” Hayes wrote. “It provides the funding to bring remarkable speakers to campus through the Lecture Fund. Georgetown Day itself, the hallmark community day on the Hilltop, is funded through the student activities fee.”
GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee Vice Chair Scott Lowder (COL ’17) said a hike in the activities fee is a good idea because many students are active in student groups.
“The arguments in favor of it make sense, in that we are a very program-heavy university, especially considering that unlike other universities, we don’t have as much of a Greek system,” Lowder said in an interview with The Hoya.
Lowder said this spring is not an ideal time to push for a referendum; Mack and Vice President Jessica Andino (COL ’18) won the executive race on their platform of affordability.
“We just had an executive campaign centered on affordability, and tuition is rising, so that’s student costs rising,” Lowder said. “I don’t think this is the right time to put a referendum to the student body.”
Hayes said the increased fee would lower out-of-pocket costs for low-income students, for whom the student activities fee is already accounted by financial aid packages.
“For the many Hoyas receiving financial aid the financial barrier to participating fully in student activities on campus will be reduced,” Hayes wrote.
Student Activities Commission Chair Ricardo Mondolfi (SFS ’19) said he is not yet convinced a fee hike is necessary.
“If this is a proposal that is put forth, it needs to be very nuanced, met with a university increase in their funding to us,” Mondolfi said.
Mack said even if the university pledges to match the amount raised by students, administrators would have to account for the expense in other areas.
“Money does not fall out of the sky. If we raise the Student Activities Fee, and say, ‘hey, university, you should pay more money too,’ that has to come from somewhere,” Mack said. “It will result in equally scalable tuition increases or increases in other areas.”
Mondolfi said the Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and Chris Fisk (COL ’17) GUSA executive considered a fee raise, but decided against it.
“We needed to get a lot more serious with efficiency, making sure the funds we already have are spent appropriately, and the solution was not necessarily to throw more money at it,” Mondolfi said.
Mondolfi said he doubts the current student body would support a cost-raising proposal.
“It is very easy for anyone to raise the argument that we essentially are raising tuition,” Mondolfi said. “For less interested students, the idea of having to pay more, and having it go to GUSA — people might be skeptical, and there could easily be a massive turnout against it.”
Lowder said the idea does not have enough support within the GUSA senate or among Fin/App Committee members. Two-thirds of the GUSA senate must vote to approve adding a referendum to the GUSA election ballot.
Mack said event co-sponsorship between distinct, but similarly minded student groups could be an alternative
“Any given week at Georgetown, you may have different clubs that are putting on virtually the same event,” Mack said. “That will help with costs, and that will also help with cross-pollination of ideas, so that could be really beneficial in helping us getting a lot of bang out of our buck.”

President Donald Trump’s proposed federal budget is expected to cost the Washington, D.C. government approximately $103 million and could cut about 120 public-sector jobs, hindering affordable housing and other social services in the city, District officials said Monday.
According to City Administrator Rashad Young, Trump’s plan to defund agencies such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development — targeted for a 13-percent spending cut — would significantly reduce a large portion of the federal grants that are used in District programs to help the poor.
According to Young’s office, city officials are most concerned about the Interagency Council on Homelessness, the Minority Business Development Agency, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which is a nonprofit funded by the federal government to promote public broadcasting, and the New Starts Program, which provides federal grants for large transit projects.
“As outlined, President Trump’s budget would undermine much of the progress we have made in Washington, D.C., over the past two years,” Young said in a press release Monday. “This proposal would force the city to make some very hard choices in order to keep our commitment to expanding prosperity for all D.C. residents.”
According to Mayor Muriel Bowser’s (D) office, the District’s federal funds finance programs and agencies such as D.C. Public Schools, D.C.’s Public Charter Schools, the D.C. Tuition Assistance Grant, the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council, District Emergency Planning, the Presidential Inauguration and HIV/AIDS prevention programs.
After initial review of the budget, Bowser expressed concerns for the impact this proposal might have on District residents.
“In recent years, Washington, D.C., has seen tremendous growth and today our economy is one of the top-three strongest local economies in the country,” Bowser said in a March 20 press release. “Now, at a time when we are working to ensure that all of D.C.’s residents benefit from our city’s prosperity, we have significant concerns about the President’s initial budget outline.”
Bowser continued by predicting future hardships the city might face under the proposed budget.
“By making cuts to programs that support basic needs like housing and healthcare, this budget will force our city to make tough choices about programs that not only promote growth but enable us to support our most vulnerable residents,” Bowser said.
Members of the Georgetown community also intend to keep track of the budget as it develops, noting how it may impact the university community, according to Georgetown University Media Relations Manager Ryan King.
King said the proposed budget calls for cuts that would impact federal financial aid to students and work study programs, as well as grants for faculty and graduate student research on academic, health and science topics. Additionally, King said nurse training programs and resources for student veterans could be affected.
“Georgetown is concerned about the potential impact of the administration’s proposed budget and continues to monitor the deliberations over it closely,” King wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Bowser indicated her office will look for ways to counter the negative effects of the budget.
“As we continue analyzing the budget and advocating for programs that move our city and country forward, my administration will work with the community and our partners on the Council to promote and defend D.C.’s values,” Bowser said in the press release.
The full budget proposal is expected to be released by Trump and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney (SFS ’89) in May. The final budget is scheduled to be voted on by Congress in the fall, prior to the start of the next fiscal year October 1.

Drain the swamp! This is a great place to start. In this case it is a nation that was being torn asunder by you “progressives” who have been voting for many years to keep your selves in these positions where you can leach off of the productive elements of what really makes up America and that is not centered in the D.C. area.
“Hillary Clinton has won District of Columbia’s 3 electoral votes. Clinton has 270,107 more votes than Donald J. Trump, with 100 percent reporting. Hillary Clinton is up by 87 points with all precincts reporting.”
HRC received 90.9% of the votes of people like you who are only interested in their own narrow agendas and welfare while the Republican, Donald J. Trump, somehow found 12,723 independent thinking people, or 4.1%, of the residence of this swamp, to vote for him.
 It is none of your business where I might live. I have only missed voting on one election since voting for Barry Goldwater
in 1964 when the Texan, Lyndon B. Johnson, won by 85.50% compared to Goldwater’s 14.50%.  The trend has gone from that percentage in 1964 to what happened in 2016 shows that the vile swamp that you and others of like mind wallow in, and protect at all cost, must be drained. I see that you still live in the DC area & that is fine; but, in typical far left liberal fashion you think that you have the right to tell me where I can live.

The university plans to rename Freedom Hall as Isaac Hawkins Hall in late April, in honor of the first enslaved person recorded in the 1838 sale of the 272 slaves that benefitted Georgetown.
University President John J. DeGioia announced the university’s intention to rename Freedom and Remembrance Halls as Isaac and Anne Marie Beecraft Halls in September, as part of a series of plans to address the university’s history with slavery.
The change to rename Freedom Hall was announced to residential assistants and residents of Ryan and Freedom Halls yesterday in an email from University Chief of Staff Joe Ferrara. The dedication ceremony will occur with the university’s Emancipation Day celebrations April 18.
The university has not yet announced its plans for the formal renaming of Remembrance Hall as Anne Marie Beecraft Hall.
The university also announced in September that it would offer descendants of the 272 who apply to Georgetown legacy status in admissions, and has established an institute to research slavery and its aftermath.
The two halls that constitute the Former Jesuit Residence were first renamed from Mulledy Hall and McSherry Hall after a series of student protests and a sit-in in DeGioia’s office in November 2015. Former University President Thomas Mulledy, S.J., authorized the sale of the 272 slaves to a Louisiana plantation, while former University President William McSherry, S.J., served as Mulledy’s lawyer during the sale.
Historical research conducted by the university indicated Isaac’s last name as Hawkins, even though no documents show the last name, according to Ferrara’s email.
History professor Adam Rothman, who is a member of the Working Group on Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation, said genealogical research showed Hawkins was the patriarch of the Hawkins family.
“On the Jesuit records, his name is just Isaac; he’s not recorded with a last name,” Rothman said. “But the more research that was done and incorporating the perspectives of the descendants themselves, it’s clear that he is the patriarch of his family. Even though his last name is not recorded, in archival material, his children and grandchildren are all Hawkins.”
The university initially consulted the descendants of the 272 on renaming Freedom Hall to Isaac Hall, rather than Isaac Hawkins Hall, earlier this year, according to Patricia Bayonne Johnson, a descendant of one of the 272 slaves.
Johnson said the naming has significance beyond simply renaming a building.
“We’ve been in the shadows so long so now that this has full exposure of the Jesuit slaveholdings we took to making things as clear as possible,” Johnson said. “Isaac Hawkins was a slave a long time ago, but they need to use the full name.”
Rothman said the Working Group made the recommendation to rename the buildings to help highlight Georgetown’s relationship with slavery.
“We thought it was important to come up with new names for the buildings that didn’t erase the history, but brought attention to the buildings in a different kind of way,” Rothman said. “And naming the buildings after one of the GU 272 would be one of the ways of highlighting aspects of Georgetown’s history that have been unknown or hidden for a long time.”
Johnson said recognizing someone’s surname simultaneously recognizes their humanity.
“Without the surname, he could be anybody,” Bayonne Johnson said. “In this country, the naming pattern is to have a first and a last name; it’s important to you.”
Correction: This article previously stated Remembrance Hall would be renamed as Anne Marie Beechcraft Hall; the hall will be renamed as Anne Marie Becraft Hall.

Student organizations and outside businesses on campus accepting credit card payments will be required to provide their own Wi-Fi service next year to maintain compliance with credit card industry-imposed regulations.
Organizations, including the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union, Students of Georgetown, Inc. and businesses in Hoya Court, must use their own internet networks.
The regulations, part of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, require all companies that accept credit card payments from major card schemes to host their data on a secure network in order to protect customer data. Because SaxaNet does not meet PCI requirements, outside businesses and clubs accepting credit card payments must purchase and operate their own networks.
Vice President and Chief Information Officer Judd Nicholson said the switch is necessary and important.
“Maintaining compliance with the PCI regulation is very important for both the business, groups and the university to protect our consumers and to avoid steep fines and disruption to business activities,” Nicholson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The change has been about a two-year process, according to GUASFCU Chief Technology Officer Nick Matz (COL ’18). Outside businesses, such as the ones operating in Hoya Court, transitioned to their own networks first, and the university is now helping student clubs like GUASFCU and The Corp make the switch.
GUASFCU Chief Executive Officer Rupert Kingshott (MSB ’18) said the group recognizes that the university was forced to make the change.
“It’s not like the university wanted to do it, but their hand has been forced by compliance,” Kingshott said. “I do think the university has been very good in the process, and they deserve credit.”
Although the organizations will now have to pay for their own internet, Kingshott and Matz said this likely will not affect the budget of GUASFCU. In fact, Kingshott and Matz are optimistic about what the change could mean for their business.
“The positive side is that we’ll have our own network, which will be good for our own security,” Matz said. “If we want to make changes to our network, we can.”
According to Corp Chief Executive Officer Melina Hsiao (COL ’18), student groups were not given enough time to make the transition to a new network.
“The main frustration is that it’s coming to us late so we don’t have time to put it in our budget, and there was no possibility for us to account for it in advance,” Hsiao said. “We didn’t really have the capacity to take a year to budget for it.”
The Corp is planning to partner with an external organization for the creation of the network. Hsiao said The Corp will outsource much of the work of building their own network, after assessing the job would be too demanding to handle in-house.
“Moving the entire system, building a Wi-Fi network on our own, is a massive undertaking for our IT department,” Hsiao said.
The Corp announced last month it will also be moving Uncommon Grounds from its current location in Sellinger Lounge to the second floor of the Georgetown University Bookstore resulting from the expansion of the bookstore this summer. Hsiao said these two major changes pose a challenge for The Corp’s leadership.
“The combination of the two coming at once is not ideal,” Hsiao said.
However, Hsiao said The Corp will also benefit from owning its own Wi-Fi network, not only for security but also for practicality.
“Building our own Wi-Fi will allow us to intentionally put strong Wi-Fi in physical places where we need it,” Hsiao said.

The university’s endowment declined 3 percent from about $1.53 billion to $1.48 billion between fiscal years 2015 and 2016, according to a report of U.S. and Canadian university endowments conducted by the National Association of College and University Business Officers.
Georgetown’s endowment is now ranked 61st for endowment funds of peer universities, below Harvard University, The George Washington University and Stanford University. The average change of all endowment funds reported by NACUBO was a loss of 2.9 percent from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2016.
Georgetown University, ranked 20 on the U.S. News & World Report’s 2017 Best National Universities, has the lowest endowment of the top 20 universities listed. The average funds of the endowments of the top 20 universities, excluding the University of California system, is about $10.07 billion, approximately $8.59 billion larger than Georgetown’s endowment.
Emory University and Washington University in St. Louis, which rank immediately after Georgetown, have endowments of approximately $6.40 billion and $6.46 billion, respectively.
A smaller endowment hinders Georgetown’s ability to offer competitive financial aid packages to prospective students, according to Bart Moore, vice president of the Office of Advancement. Moore said in an interview with The Hoya the primary reason students do not attend Georgetown is because of a lack of financial support.
“From their responses to our survey request, we do know that the most-cited reason they enroll elsewhere is they were offered more generous financial aid someplace else,” Moore said. “So, it is very clear that financial aid or affordability is a leading reason that students choose to go elsewhere.”
Georgetown University uses the Free Application for Federal Student Aid to determine a family’s financial need. Georgetown matches the financial need indicated by the FAFSA, but does not offer merit-based aid.
“Sometimes, other institutions that are not limited to need-based aid will seek out or try to compete for that student by offering merit aid exclusively or merit aid on top of some need-sensitive financial aid offer,” Moore said.
Georgetown’s endowment size has limited its ability to meet the FAFSA’s indicated financial need with only direct grants, requiring students to take out loans or participate in federal work-study to receive their full indicated need.
“Historically, Georgetown has met its students financial aid needs through a somewhat greater, modestly greater reliance on federal government guaranteed loans and federal work-study and then a comparatively smaller grant or scholarship,” Moore said, “and some of our peer institutions, for example, have eliminated government-subsidized loans or they’re reducing somewhat federal work study income.”
Media Relations Manager Ryan King said Georgetown’s endowment has performed well relative to global markets.
“Against a challenging global market environment in recent years, Georgetown’s endowment has performed reasonably well,” King wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Over the trailing five years ended 12/31/2016, the Georgetown endowment earned an annualized return of nearly 8 percent compared to 5 percent for the portfolio’s benchmark. This return is top quartile among more than 300 endowments and foundations tracked by the university’s investment consultant.”
According to the FY2016 Stewardship Investment Report, which is sent out to Georgetown donors and is available on Georgetown University’s Office of Advancement website, the fund has grown from $696 million in fiscal year 2004 to $1.48 billion in fiscal year 2016. While returns on investment help the fund grow, the fastest way to grow the fund is by increasing its principal.
“The fastest way to grow the endowment is through new contributions, and we’re contributing to the endowment and accelerating at historic high rates,” Moore said.
Georgetown has launched a series of recent campaigns to increase the size of its endowment and to fund other projects, such as the John R. Thompson Intercollegiate Athletic center. The For Generations to Come Campaign lasted five years and ended last June, raising $1.675 billion over that time.
Five percent of the endowment is withdrawn for use as current funds, enabling it to be used by the university for a range of needs. Of that 5 percent, 36 percent is spent on academic research and programs, 25 percent on professorships, 22 percent on financial aid and the remainder on smaller initiatives, such as facilities and library expenses.
Georgetown University Student Association President Kamar Mack (COL ’19) said it is important that students understand the value of contributions from an early stage.
“Making sure that Hoyas understand why it’s important to give back to the university while we’re here,” Mack said. “That’s why Jessica and I want to work closely with the Office of Advancement and make sure that everyone is indoctrinated with the concept that Georgetown is as good as you make it, and we want to make sure that everyone leaves with a sense of why it’s so important to give back to the university.”

With the numbers stated, that leaves approximately $24,750,000.00 for financial aid every year. Approximate cost of attendance is $72,400.00 per year. Georgetown could provide full tuition/room and board assistance to 342 students each year, leaving no partial assistance for other students. This equates to approximately 1.85% of the student body (undergrad, grad, professional) having full rides. Not every student gets a full ride as you well know, but it puts things into perspective. This also puts into perspective how little most of Professors are making as well.

That’s just the endowment funding stream, Mr. Sullivan. As Jack DeGioia has often noted, Georgetown is a heavily tuition-dependent institution. That’s where most of the money for operations – and financial aid as well – comes from.

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) announced March 15 that she is requesting funds from the D.C. Council to establish a green bank to aid the District’s clean energy efforts. This would make the District the first U.S. city to create a green bank.
Green banks are financial institutions that use public funds to help the private sector invest in energy-efficient technologies by providing loans, leases and other financial incentives to green energy businesses.
By using public funds, green banks are able to minimize private investment risk in order to incentivize a transition to clean energy.
Bowser plans to introduce green bank legislation to the City Council in the coming weeks, asking for $7 million next year to fund her proposal. This money would come from the District’s Renewable Energy Development Fund, which comes from residents’ tax dollars.
District Department of Energy and Environment Director Tommy Wells said the initiative will help unite private and public sector interests, making the District a more environmental city.
“I commend Mayor Bowser for introducing this innovative legislation,” Wells said in a press release March 15. “The D.C. Green Bank will pair private capital with public investment to more efficiently achieve our ambitious greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and to further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.”
Green banks have already been established across the United States in New York, Connecticut, California, Hawaii, Rhode Island and Maryland; however, no major U.S. city had set one up until now.
In a March 15 press release, Bowser said initiative is part of a larger plan to create a more energy-efficient District.
“We need to lead the way when it comes to protecting and preserving the environment,” Bowser said. “By creating a green bank, we will create more jobs for D.C. residents, which will allow us to continue our push for inclusive prosperity.”
Bowser also said this initiative is in line with her administration’s broader goal of creating a more environmentally friendly District. In 2016, Bowser launched the Climate Ready D.C. program, which suggested changes to District infrastructure and policy strategy to help make the District more resilient to the effects of climate change.
Councilmember Robert White (D-At Large) said he supports the project ahead of the introduction of the legislation.
“These investments will accelerate the use of green technology, which will in turn protect our environment and the health of our residents. It will also help put many residents to work with careers in a growing industry,” White wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Other councilmembers have not released public stances on the Green Bank proposal. The
Office of Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) said the chairman has no official stance on the Green Bank legislation yet. Other offices did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Democracy Is For People, a campaign finance oversight group, filed a complaint with the Washington, D.C. Office of Campaign Finance on March 7 alleging that Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) illegally accepted more than 20 campaign donations during her 2014 mayoral campaign.
According to the complaint, the organization worked with its umbrella advocacy group Public Citizen to look into Bowser’s donations after the Washington City Paper reported that Bowser accepted a $3,000 campaign donation from the development group Sanford Capitol, $1,000 over the limit for individual campaign donations in the District.
After completing their investigation, the group counted 23 total donations and $31,500 in supposedly illegal funds.
Aquene Freechild, the co-director of the Democracy Is For People campaign, submitted the complaint and said the organization also wanted to depict the influence of corporate real estate developers in District politics. Of the 23 total allegedly illegal donations, 15 are from real estate companies.
“We felt it was a really important moment to share that this is not a unique circumstance, but rather that many developers and real estate folks have been the backbone of the Mayor’s funding as well as many members of the council over the years,” Freechild said in an interview with The Hoya. “We don’t think that that’s ideal when you have a city where affordable housing is one of the biggest crises that we’re facing.”
However, according to The Washington Post, development groups in the District commonly make multiple maximum $2,000 donations to local candidates. Frequently, initial donations are made in the name of the corporation itself and then given in the names of the company heads. This practice is legal under District campaign finance law.
In 2014, Bowser’s campaign received more than 7,000 individual donations totaling $3.6 million in contributions, according to the Office of Campaign Finance’s E-Filing system.
“If these reported excessive contributions were not simple reporting errors, but instead reflect a consistent pattern of negligence and failure to comply with the District’s campaign finance law, we ask that appropriate corrective action be taken to ensure that such abuses do not continue,” the complaint said.
OCF Spokesperson Wesley Williams confirmed in an email to The Hoya that the office received the complaint and that the matter is under review, but would not comment further.
The Washington Post also identified other donations the campaign identified as potentially violating district law are the fault of clerical errors by the Bowser campaign.
For example, two $2,000 donations appeared in Bowser’s campaign donation records that appeared to be donated by the same individual, Franklin Haney, were actually donated by a father and a son named Franklin Haney, Sr. and Franklin Haney, Jr.
Bowser’s 2014 campaign treasurer Ben Soto said though the campaign may have made small errors, the District OCF already looked into their donations during 2014 and again this year after the campaign account was closed and found no wrongdoing.
“The Muriel Bowser for Mayor Campaign Committee has always acted in good faith with full transparency,” Soto wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Like all campaign committees in the District of Columbia, the campaign committee was subjected to a complete vetting by the OCF, which resulted in the campaign committee being terminated with no reported violations. We will continue to work with OCF to make sure there were no excessive contributions from any contributor.”
Freechild said regardless of why the mistakes were made, District residents deserve an explanation from Bowser’s administration.
“If it’s sloppiness they should still apologize and fix it,” Freechild said. “If this was something that every treasurer goofed up on we would have a bigger problem. But not everyone who runs for office has this many mistakes, if that’s what they are.”
Freechild added that she believes that these instances were more than just mistakes.
“I think that there are probably some bigger problems there. That’s why we asked for an investigation,” Freechild said. “It could be that there are many mistakes, but they have an obligation to make that clear for the public.”
Though Freechild acknowledged that the donations the campaign identified add up to a fraction of a percent of Bowser’s total campaign donations, she said it represents a greater attitude among the Bowser campaign.
“I’ve been disturbed by the response from the Mayor’s former campaign staff,” Freechild said. “You expect that if there’s a problem that somebody would apologize and try to fix it if they’re in public office, and that’s not been the response we’re seeing,”

A lack of resources prevents improvements to student health, according to students and administrators in a panel on student health in the Healey Family Student Center on Wednesday.
At the panel sponsored by the Georgetown University Student Association, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said the university is looking to increase the number of resources available for student health.
“Short-term vision: More space, more integration, some more exam rooms. We need a little more square footage where we are,” Olson said. “That will help a lot.”
The roundtable, moderated by GUSA Mental Health Policy Team Chair Sylvia Levy (SFS ’18), featured Olson, Assistant Vice President of Student Health Vince WinklerPrins, Director of the Student Health Center Leanne Lash and Director of the Student Health Insurance Office Laura Hardman Crosby.
GUSA President Kamar Mack (COL ’19) said one of his initial goals is to improve Student Health Center accessibility.
“The number one thing would be access to appointments,” Mack said. “This goes back to what I said earlier, because sometimes there are just constraints that limit what the Student Health Center can do.”
Olson said Georgetown’s commitment to Catholic and Jesuit values inspires its policies on healthcare. Currently, the Affordable Care Act requires student health insurance plans to cover contraception.
Under the Trump Administration, this provision may be changed, and students may not be insured for contraception.
Reproductive justice advocacy group H*yas for Choice Co-president Brinna Ludwig (NHS ’17) said contraception is not in opposition to the university’s Catholic values.
“I personally think that providing contraception is not in conflict with Catholic values,” Ludwig said. “I think that the fact that a majority of Catholics use some form of contraceptives is a testament to that. I think they purposely withhold certain information that makes Georgetown less marketable and less accessible to non-Catholic students and I think it’s negligent for student health.”
According to Mack, the nuances of Catholicism and contraception are unique within a college setting.
“That’s always a difficult conversation to have because as Dr. Olson mentioned, we are a Catholic and Jesuit institution, and that’s valuable. That’s something that makes Georgetown unique, and it’s something that we’ve been since the beginning,” Mack said. “At the same time, we have a student body that is of college age and we have different health needs that that brings up. It’s definitely good to see that Dr. Olson recognizes that.”
The university is making efforts to provide lower-cost health services for students. Lash, who joined Georgetown this semester, said the Student Health Center aims to put out baskets with menstrual health care products and is planning to put out more in the future.
Co-president of H*yas for Choice Emily Stephens (SFS ’17) said she is optimistic about Lash’s plans to provide free menstrual health products Student Health Center.
“I was super inspired by Dr. Lash, the new director of the Student Health Center,” Stephens said. “She started in January, and she seems really passionate about addressing the issues that we’ve been bringing up for close to two semesters now, and she seems like she’s noticed those things independently and is actively trying to address them now, so I really like her a lot.”

Someone should really let the Pope know that he’s wrong, and that Brinna Ludwig knows more about what’s “in conflict with Catholic values”

The Church’s teaching is clear, as expressed in Humanae vitae. I hope the administration will follow actual church teaching on contraception instead of relying on Ms. Ludwig’s opinion.

Thanks for sharing this. Health is wealth. We should all be health conscious.
