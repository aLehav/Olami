Bucking a nationwide trend of declining interest in master of business administration degrees, applications to Georgetown’s MBA program have increased in recent years.
A 2011 survey released by the Graduate Management Admission Council reported that more than two-thirds of participating full-time MBA programs saw application numbers drop from 2009 to 2010 and 2010 to 2011.
According to Assistant Dean and Director of the McDonough School of Business Admissions Kelly Wilson, Georgetown’s application numbers have risen from last year at this point in the admissions cycle, while most comparable business schools have seen no change or a dip in application numbers. Georgetown’s full-time MBA program received 1,438 applications for the class that began studying in fall 2011.
Wilson credited the university’s adaptations in a changing MBA recruitment landscape for the rise in applications. The MBA program offers virtual visits, web seminars, and a customized web portal for prospective students.
Wilson also said that MBA recruiters strive to engage applicants throughout the admissions cycle.
“Our goal is to build personal relationships with candidates since those relationships strengthen their emotional tie to Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business,” she wrote in an email.
The survey, which included Georgetown, reported that applications to part-time MBA programs decreased on average as well. Michael Templeman, director of admissions for the university’s MBA evening program, attributed this nationwide decline to the recent financial downturn.
“While the economic recession has indeed caused other business schools to realize losses in their applicant pools, Georgetown’s unique attributes and its premier positioning in the D.C. marketplace has enabled it to continue to recruit and retain some of the top talent across all of its MBA programs despite the macroeconomic conditions,” he wrote in an email.
The study also reported that the volume of applications for executive programs, intended for people with eight years of managerial experience, has held steady on average. Among participating schools, 42 percent reported a rise in applications, while another 42 percent reported a decline.
According to Elaine Romanelli, he senior associate dean for the full-time MBA program, it is probable that new formats for business education, such as part-time, evening, online and executive programs, will lead to a reduction in full-time MBA applications. MSB Dean David Thomas also said in a recent interview with Minnesota’s Star-Tribune that he believes the number of schools able to maintain large, full-time MBA programs will be narrowed to 20 over the next 10 years.
Bloomberg Businessweek identified 30 schools as in its top tier. The magazine currently ranks Georgetown’s full-time MBA program as the 33rd-best program in the country, placing it in what it deems the second tier of schools.

Thefts in the Metropolitan Police Department’s second district, which includes Georgetown, have spiked 17 percent since Jan. 1, in keeping with a trend of increasing theft across D.C.
Between Jan. 1 and March 21, a total of 592 thefts occurred in the second district, an increase from the 505 committed during the same period last year.
Citywide, a five-year high of 2,119 thefts occurred since the beginning of the year, a 21 percent increase from the 1,756 that were reported during this period in 2011.
Throughout the past five years, thefts between Jan. 1 and March 21 have increased by 29 percent across D.C. and by 21 percent in the second district.
The trend of rising theft is not reflected at the university. The Department of Public Safety reported 58 thefts between Jan. 1 and March 22 of 2011, compared to 56 thefts during the same period this year.
However, the university has experienced a recent increase in burglaries. DPS reported 19 burglaries this year, while three had been reported by this point last year.
Many of these burglaries involved computers. Twelve burglaries occurred at administrative and academic buildings since Jan. 1, and in eight of these, some kind of computer equipment was stolen.
Meanwhile, citywide burglaries between Jan. 1 and March 21 decreased 25 percent, from 819 to 611 incidents. In the second district, burglaries dropped from 131 to 73, a 44 percent drop.

While Georgetown’s graduation rate for the Class of 2010 was among the highest in the nation at 88.9 percent, disparities exist within the university between graduation rates for different racial groups.
White students, who make up the majority of the student body, graduated at a rate of 90.7 percent in four years or less. Asian students represented Georgetown’s highest graduation rate at 92.6 percent, according to data from the Chronicle of Higher Education.
These two rates are each more than 10 percentage points higher than the graduation rates for black, Hispanic and Native American students, who graduated at rates of 78 percent, 79 percent and 75 percent, respectively.
Director of the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access Dennis Williams, who is also associate dean of students, said the disparity is cause for concern.
“There should not be a racial gap in terms of graduation,” he said. “This is something we need to be concerned about.”
Williams attributed some of the discrepancies to aspects of university culture.
“If there is a gap with certain identifiable groups of students, is part of that due to a sense of not fully belonging or less-than-complete ownership in the institution? I believe that’s part of it,” he said.
University Provost James O’Donnell described the numbers as “impressive” but did not believe it was appropriate to specifically compare graduation rates of different ethnic groups.
“There are many factors [that contribute] to graduation rates, and I think just asking at the ethnicity level is very misleading,” O’Donnell wrote in an email. “Our numbers compare very favorably with national numbers and peer institutions.”
Statistics, however, show that the racial disparities among graduation rates at Georgetown are larger than at some peer institutions.
The difference between the university’s overall graduation rate and that of black students for 2010 was 10.9 percent, while The George Washington University reported a 5.2 percentage-point difference and the University of Pennsylvania reported an 8.7 percentage point difference. But Boston College and Northwestern University, for example, had disparities larger than Georgetown’s.
The gap between the university’s overall graduation rate and that of black students has ranged from 7 to 12 percent over the last nine years. The difference between the overall and Hispanic graduation rates, however, has varied more widely over the same time period. While the rate for Hispanic students has been at least 9 percent lower than the overall rate for the past two years, it was higher than the overall rate in 2004 and 2008.
Williams noted that the varying gap between the overall and black graduation rates may be due to the relatively small number of black students at Georgetown. In the university population that would have graduated in spring 2010 after four years on the Hilltop, 6.6 was black.
“One thing to keep in mind is that we’re talking about a pretty small pool,” he said, adding that this means small changes to the number of graduating students have a major impact on reported percentages.
According to Williams, the graduation rate discrepancies are connected to negative socioeconomic and academic stereotypes tied to race. He believes that black and Hispanic students battle an environment that assumes they are less qualified.
“It can create a sense of disadvantage, of not quite fitting in the dominant culture,” he said.
“As an African-American [or] Latino student, you are conscious and suspicious of some of those expectations, and you have to be on guard about those.”
Georgetown Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán President Antony López (COL ’14) agreed with Williams’ assessment, adding that classrooms can sometimes feel like they are dominated by white students and professors.
“I would say a lot of the low numbers can be linked to overall isolation and displacement some Hoyas feel when arriving to the Hilltop,” he said.
According to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, Georgetown offers programs to assist students at individual levels in order to boost the university’s retention and graduation rates.
“Statistically, some groups of students may take longer to graduate or may be more likely to transfer, and we continue to invest in programs to help them succeed at Georgetown,” she wrote in an email.
Compared to the four-year graduation rates, the percentage of students who graduate in six years or less shows a similar gap between the overall rate and the black rate, but a 6.5 percent difference between the overall and Hispanic rates. In 2010, the university’s overall six-year graduation rate was 92.5 percent.
According to Pugh, Preparing to Excel, a pre-orientation program open to first-year and transfer students who are concerned about getting accustomed to college life, is the first program that aims to increase the likelihood of retention.
Other such initiatives include the Sophomore Year Experience, which compiles resources for second-year students, and the Academic Safety Net program, which works to identify students who may be experiencing difficulties and direct them to the appropriate resources.
Williams, however, believes that there is more that needs to be done to address the needs of minority students, particularly academically.
“When we’re talking about broader areas of inquiry and exploration in the curriculum that bring in other cultural dimensions, it builds that recognition of appreciation [of minority groups] here,” he said. “I believe that is another way to help students where there is a graduation gap to feel more at home in the institution.”

In the dead of night of May 2, 2011, two Blackhawk helicopters touched down outside a dilapidated house in the small city of Abbottabad, Pakistan. Upon landing, the team of Navy SEALs aboard moved quickly to execute their mission. In just under 40 minutes, the SEALs had completed their objective and vanished into the darkness.
Hours later, President Barack Obama addressed the nation, sharing the news that Osama Bin Laden had been killed. Families sat awestruck in front of their televisions, District-area students rushed to Pennsylvania Avenue to cheer, and collectively, the nation breathed a sigh of relief.
Steven Cortes, an analyst for CNBC’s “Fast Money,” graduated from Georgetown in 1994 and was one of the many surprised by the mission. Yet, as he sat at his home in Chicago that summer night, Cortes didn’t remain in awe for long. He reacted swiftly and bought up United States currency.
Most of Cortes’ financial colleagues and acquaintances quickly branded his investment as risky. The dollar’s Euro exchange rate hovered at a paltry .673, not far off historic lows precipitated by the 2008 financial crisis, and recent economic data had done little to assuage investors’ fears over the weakness of the nation and of its currency.
Cortes was defying mass opinion; he was going against the herd.
This was not the first time Cortes had invested against prevailing Wall Street sentiments, and it would certainly not be his last.
Ten months later, Cortes still holds the dollar, which has risen to an exchange rate of roughly 0.76 against the Euro. He took a risky chance and in less than a year, his investment had grown by nearly 15%.
“What SEAL Team Six did was remind the investing world that the reserve currency does in fact default to the world’s strongest military, and the United States pulled off an exercise that night which no other country on earth could even fathom,” explained Cortes to a Georgetown audience on Feb. 28. “Going secretly into a sovereign country that far from home, hitting a target, removing it and doing all of it successfully.”
Upon leaving the Hilltop in 1994, where he was a defensive lineman on the football team, a Baker Scholar and a candidate for the Rhodes scholarship, Cortes entered the world of investing.
For four years, Cortes worked for Prudential selling government bonds before branching off on his own to found Veracruz LLC in 1998. Today, he provides investment strategy for individual investors, contributes regularly to CNBC’s “Fast Money” and, most recently, he writes. This past December, Cortes published his first book — Against the Herd: 6 Contrarian Investment Strategies You Should Follow.
After years in the financial sector, Cortes began to see an alarming pattern. He explained, “The mainstream media, the financial press and Wall Street were often wrong in their thinking and leading investors down a dangerous path.” He believes this cohesion of opinion pushed investors to a dangerous herd mentality that was responsible for devastating financial bubbles, seen most recently in the U.S. housing seen most recently in the U.S. housing and technology sectors.
“As human beings, we are evolutionarily wired to seek safety in numbers,” he said. “And while that made a lot of sense while we were in some jungle or some forest trying to escape from predators, that psyche, that ingrained predilection is a serious problem when it comes to investing.”
Cortes soon developed into a self-described contrarian investor. Often at odds with the majority of financial pundits, his calculated skepticism over conventional wisdom has led Cortes to financial success, giving him experience that he now hopes to share.
Cortes visited Georgetown to lecture on his contrarian investment strategies discussed in his book Against the Herd. While he presents six contrarian challenges, Cortes’ focuses on what he perceives as a financial bubble in emerging markets.
Most analysts see emerging markets such as China as a prime area for growth in the coming decades. China has a strong government, ranks second in number of global billionaires, and boasts a massive population which provides inexpensive labor.
To Cortes, China’s “power” is a slowly crumbling facade. He believes investors are wrong in viewing China as a growing economic superpower and instead urges them to invest in a United States that is only beginning its reign of economic dominance.
While China is a wealthy country, as a whole it is an incredibly poor country akin even to parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Per capita, American income is over 10 times greater than Chinese and in a recent poll of China’s wealthiest citizens, 60% revealed plans to leave in the near future.
Cortes argued that China’s authoritarian government, once instrumental in economic success, has already started to inhibit growth. Inefficiencies in central planning are no more evident than in demographics. Because of China’s one child policy, a young female population necessary for continued demographic growth is nearly nonexistent.
Though China certainly does provide inexpensive labor, Cortes believes it lacks a more important component of growth: innovation. He argued, “There is no interest to protect property because they’re not creating any to protect. It is a culture of conformity not creativity.”
While Cortes’ arguments against Chinese supremacy were quite powerful themselves, one graduate student in the audience, who emigrated from China in the 1980s with his wife and children, boosted them even further. The student praised Cortes for his understanding of China’s reality and hoped that the author’s book and lecture would be a wake-up call for American policymakers and investors.
The truth about contrarian advice is that it is often only considered once it is too late.
Cortes hopes that these mistakes will not be repeated with China and other potentially destructive popular opinions. He expects that his book will allow his contrarian opinions to reach the right audience and create skepticism. From here though, it’s up to the American consumer to run with the herd or not.

It’s 1 a.m. on a Thursday and Ianthe Metzger (COL ’12) is sitting in the semi-darkened Center for Social Justice, video camera in hand, interviewing a custodian on her 15-minute break.
“She just sat with me briefly and talked as the camera kept rolling,” Metzger said of the interview, which was conducted as part of the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor’s Working Lives Oral History Project.
The project, which launched in fall 2012, aims to record the lives of D.C.’s workers through video interviews.
“The history of workers in D.C. is largely untold, and it seems to us it’s a history that should be uncovered, so we started this project to investigate and explore the experiences of the people who clean the buildings and guard the museums and serve the food here,” Jennifer Luff, the research director for the Kalmanovitz Initiative, said.
The edited interviews will be uploaded to a public website, which Luff hopes to establish by next fall.
The goal of the first set of interviews was to gather a history of the Justice for Janitors campaign, a1990s initiative that sought to unionize janitors in D.C., including those who worked at Georgetown.
Students in Luff’s class last spring semester interviewed about 30 people involved with the campaign, from janitors to political leaders. This semester, the class’s work has broadened to include employees from more venues on campus.
Luff said that the project greatly relies on students in the “Working Lives: Theory and Practice of Oral History” course. They are responsible for deciding questions to ask the interviewees, conducting interviews in the field and editing footage.
Metzger is one of the five students currently enrolled in Luff’s class. In addition to the CSJ custodian, she has also interviewed an employee in the financial aid department.
“It was great to see how people see Georgetown from the staff perspective, and not just the student and the faculty,” she said. “These are the people who make Georgetown actually run.”
Metzger said that the interviews have influenced the perspective through which she sees how events impact different groups in society.
“We’ve had a lot of Leo’s workers interviews. … The campaign was just completed and the contract ratified, so all the interviews focused on that a lot,” Metzger said. “It was really interesting to hear the workers who were really heavily involved talk about how much their lives would change.”
According to Metzger, the project serves to infuse recorded history with human emotion.
“History, regardless of who writes it, is a really biased thing, but with oral history you give that person the agency to tell it as they see it,” she said. “History is very based in fact, so with oral history you get at the emotional significance of events rather than just the historical significance, what something meant to that one person.”

Kober-Cogan Building, which was closed in May 2010 after a steam leak, will remain closed indefinitely, according to the university.
The building, which is located between the Leavey Center and the Georgetown University Hospital parking lot, is part of the Georgetown University Medical Center.
According to Georgetown University Hospital Director of Media Relations Marianne Worley, even though the leak was fixed, the presence of mold led the university to turn off heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems in the building and relocate the occupants.
The building previously housed the department of psychiatry.
Although trucks from Rolyn, a disaster recovery and reconstruction firm, have been parked outside of Kober-Cogan throughout the academic year, the trucks are not associated with any activities in the building, according to Worley.
Although it has been empty for almost two years, Kober-Cogan was burglarized in February when a suspect stole a sign from inside the building.
The Medical Center has not confirmed whether the building will reopen, and its future purpose remains unclear.
Across campus on the south side of Dahlgren Quadrangle, Mulledy Building has been empty since 2003.
Built in 1833, the building most recently comprised the old Jesuit Residence with the adjacent Gervase Building and Ryan Hall. Since the Jesuit community’s move to Wolfington Hall in 2003, the windows of Mulledy Building have been boarded up, and the building has remained vacant. Gervase has since been occupied by administrative offices, while Ryan Hall is home to the Woodstock Theological Center.
The university currently does not have a plan to reopen the former Jesuit residence due to financial constraints, according to University Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh.
“Mulledy Hall needs significant renovation and funding is not currently in place to undertake the work,” she wrote in an email.

The site of the former Georgetown Auto Service and Washingtonian convenience store near the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue and Q Street remains vacant more than a year after a fire forced it to close.
According to Helder Gil, a spokesman for the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, the development of the property at 1576 Wisconsin Ave. has been delayed because the landlord has not produced the necessary plans to obtain a construction permit.
A fire caused by fuel vapors forced the building to close on March 15, 2011. Three employees were injured, though none of the victims required transport for medical care. The fire also spread to the kitchen of nearby Los Cuates, forcing the restaurant to close temporarily.
Georgetown Auto Service owner Bobby Gonzalez, who rented the property, said that he had hoped to reopen the store by fall 2011 but the reopening has been postponed indefinitely.
“As far as I know, [the landlord] is trying to rebuild as soon as [he] can and put it back together, but nobody knows the timeline,” Gonzalez said. While waiting to reopen his business in Georgetown, Gonzalez works from Alexandria, Va.
According to Gil, the owner had submitted a permit application for renovations in September. The application was not approved because it required additional plans and drawings from an architect or engineer. Gil said the DCRA needs the more detailed plans from the landlord because they do not want renovations to weaken the structural integrity of the building during construction. D.C. regulations mandate that all renovation permits be filed by the property owner unless he authorizes his tenant to apply for the permits.
“We told him that he has to come back with more comprehensive building plans and drawings, and we are still waiting for them to come back,” Gil said.
He added that it was unusual for the permit process to take this long.
“It’s a fairly simple process, but you need to come in with actual plans and engage the service of a licensed architect or engineer to design those plans,” Gil said.
Though Gil could not comment on what might happen if the property owner does not submit revised renovation plans, he said that the owner has already been fined $2,000 for failing to register his property as vacant. Additionally, the owner must pay a tax rate that is five times higher than the rate charged for occupied properties.
The owner of the property did not respond to requests for comment.

For the past two years, Georgetown’s Invisible Children chapter has worked to raise awareness of human rights violations committed by Joseph Kony, the leader of the Lord’s Resistance Army in Uganda.
However, the viral popularity and widespread debate about the documentary film “Kony 2012” has brought the group new attention.
“Our biggest problem is getting people to know that we are here. Georgetown is inundated with social justice causes. ‘Kony 2012’ really changed all of that,” Kirsten Harris (SFS ’14), one of the co-presidents of Georgetown’s Invisible Children chapter, said.
In two weeks, “Kony 2012,” a short film intended to expose the leader of a guerrilla movement infamous for employing child soldiers, has received over 84 million views on YouTube and attracted both praise and anger. On top of the criticism arguing that the video oversimplified the conflict in Uganda, additional controversy surfaced last week when Invisible Children co-founder Jason Russell was detained by police for vandalism and making sexual gestures. He was subsequently hospitalized.
However, Harris said Invisible Children’s message is not affected.
“This movement is bigger than Jason Russell. It is bigger than Kony. It is more than one person,” she said. “Jason is one of three founders. It doesn’t change anything. We are still committed to the cause.”
On April 23, the chapter is sponsoring a visit from young volunteers traveling around the United States to spread the organization’s message and fundraise. While the group has been planning the event since before “Kony 2012” went viral, it now plans to screen the film at the program.
The club also participated in Wednesday night’s Ignite Talks and a panel on “Kony 2012” sponsored by the African Society of Georgetown Thursday to raise awareness of its cause.
Club leaders plan to bring Invisible Children founder Bobby Bailey to campus. The national organization recently sent two representatives from San Diego to set up a satellite office in D.C. in an effort to create an activist community among the colleges and universities in the nation’s capital.
“All of [a] sudden we have resources that we didn’t have before,” Harris said.
The two representatives attended the general interest meeting held by Georgetown’s chapter last week for students interested in getting involved with the “Kony 2012” movement. Harris said that the turnout at the meeting was larger than it has been in past meetings.
“The main goal of the video was to get Kony’s name out there. That isn’t really necessary anymore. [The number of] views proves that,” she said.

In the wake of the International Church of Christ’s recent ban from university property, Jenny Hunter (COL ’93) shared experiences from her 12 years with the organization in an effort to raise awareness about the dangers of predatory religious groups Tuesday night.
The event opened with remarks from Drew Bratcher, the Washingtonian Magazine reporter who wrote a feature about Hunter in 2008.
“The issue that we’re talking about tonight is not that devotion to a religious group is bad,” he said. “The issue is that the International Church of Christ makes claims in ways that emphasize devotion to their group over devotion to God.”
Hunter was a senior at Georgetown when a classmate first got her involved in the group. Although Hunter was uninterested at first, she attended a group dinner in a university-owned townhouse after much persistence from her friend.
After the dinner concluded, the group began to partake in a Bible study, facilitated by a man unaffiliated with the university. The friendliness of the group and Hunter’s desire to connect more with God attracted her to the group’s message and other programming.
“Within a week and a half, I was spending all of my waking hours studying the Bible with this group,” she said. “They always had these amazing speakers that would continually inspire you and pump you up.”
Hunter’s dedication to the group, which she now deems a cult, grew to the extent that she agreed to relocate to San Francisco with it two weeks after graduating from Georgetown, despite her family’s attempts to intervene.
“I got a lot of special attention. It felt really good at first,” she said. “It appealed to my ego.”
However, once Hunter was committed to the group, ICOC leaders controlled her living situation, implemented a curfew and selected a man for her to date.
“Everything in this group was manipulation,” she said. “Over the period of a year, we were manipulated to be together.”
Over their 12 years as members, Hunter and her husband ascended in church leadership and were soon responsible for recruiting and converting new members, including wealthy locals in the San Francisco Bay Area.
“I was never physically or sexually harmed, but psychologically, I was harmed greatly and I’m sad to say I psychologically harmed others,” she said.
The breaking point for Hunter occurred when her mother-in-law died. After traveling with her husband to the funeral, the two were publicly chastised for failing to convert the deceased to the ICOC.
“Basically, for four to six hours, as we are grieving this woman’s death, we’re being told that we are responsible for her burning in hell,” Hunter said.
After the incident, Hunter decided to leave the ICOC. It took over two years for her to move back with her family in the D.C. area and another two years before she felt fully healed from the emotional trauma.
Hunter has since developed a nonprofit Alliance for Cult Recovery and Education in hopes of protecting others from similar experiences.
“There are dangerous, predatory groups that are looking for targets,” she said. “I want my story to help someone avoid living my story.”

How do I get in contact with Jenny or the Alliance, I want to ban or spread the word that ICC is on our college campus and to be cautious. I recently left the church and just like Jenny if it can happen to me, it can happen to someone else and I pray I can prevent that.

As a student at the University of Maryland in the 1970s, I can attest to the fact that even in the early stages of this movement, much damage occurred. I can relate to this woman’s desire for self-destruction, since the movement was definitely a lose-lose situation for all involved, even its leaders. May they repent of their evil behaviors before they end up in eternal torment.

Oralia says 
May 24, 2021 at 6:18 pm
I was in the San Francisco Church of Christ around the same time Jennie was. I wonder how to get in touch with her just to process but I’ve been feeling all these years
