The Board of Governors of the Georgetown University Alumni Association eliminated multiple student representative positions in late June without notification after an internal assessment found the position was ineffective.
The representatives, called student governors, had used their position on the board to lobby alumni and administrators on issues affecting students, according to former student governor Hunter Estes (SFS ’19), who raised concerns that the end of the program would diminish student access. The appointed student governors composed 13 of the board’s 120 active members.
The decision to eliminate the student governors was made by nine members of the board’s executive committee on June 28 while the full board was out of session. Three student governors say they were never directly informed of the decision by the GUAA, including one whose position was eliminated in the middle of his one-year term.
The unanimous vote by nine of the executive committee’s 17 members followed an “extensive discussion about the merits of the proposed change,” according to publicly available meeting minutes. According to GUAA bylaws, a quorum of the executive committee can exercise all powers of the Board of Governors when it is not in session.
The board, charged with governing and managing the affairs of the GUAA, is composed of Georgetown alumni and some university administrators including University President John J. DeGioia. The board refers to its purpose as a “formal communications link between the Alumni Association and the University” in an onboarding pamphlet.
The committee concluded the student governors program, started in 2006, was not successful, according to Lucy Flinn (COL ’86), director of strategic communications and marketing for GUAA.
“Coming out of the most recent assessment, the BOG concluded that it could most effectively engage students through programming developed with [the Georgetown University Student Association] and designed to support professional development and alumni networking,” Flinn wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Aaron Bennett (COL ’19), who took his position as a student governor in April, said he did not hear that his position on the board had been eliminated until the end of August, when the change was mentioned in a conversation with GUSA President Kamar Mack (COL ’19).
“I heard briefly on August 30th from Kamar, but never heard in an official capacity from GUAA,” Bennett said.
Estes and Nicole Lam (COL ’17), who were also student governors when the position was eliminated, likewise did not hear of the decision until the end of August.
The relationship had already soured between the student governors and the board before the student positions were eliminated, according to Estes. After the election last fall of a new board president, Jeff Chapski (GSB ’91), communication dwindled between the board and its student members, and Chapski pushed student voices into the background in meetings, according to Estes.
Communication between the board and its student members had been inconsistent until Chapski’s predecessor, George Peacock (CAS ’84) took office, according to Estes.
During Peacock’s term, students were better able to communicate with alumni about common goals. After the September 2016 conference when Chapski initially took control of the board, student members were not alerted of meeting details until days before the event, Estes said.
“We had talked to people, and they were going to send us committee emails. That just didn’t happen,” Estes said.
Estes said some other members of the board were more welcoming to the student participants and that Chapski’s attitude was more negative than that of the other board members.
“They were so welcoming. They were so excited that we came,” Estes said. “I think that’s more representative.”
Flinn said the decision to eliminate the position did not come wholly from Chapski but from discussions among board leadership and senior GUAA staff.
The board plans to hear proposals from GUSA to find alternative ways to connect students with alumni over the course of the semester, according to Mack.
“Right now, what the GUAA is waiting for is a proposal for a new plan for engagement. They would like to see what GUSA can bring to the table in the decision-making processes of the GUAA,” Mack said. “Where we’re at right now is redefining our relationship with the GUAA because Jeff Chapski has, in communication with me, mentioned that he doesn’t want to completely cut off ties.”

Georgetown University administrators detailed the university’s efforts to fight for a permanent replacement for the rescinded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program at an information session held in the Healey Family Student Center Social Room on Monday.
The Trump administration announced Tuesday, Sept. 5 it would rescind DACA — an executive program established by former President Barack Obama’s administration providing work authorization and legal protection to about 800,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children — with a six-month delay allowing Congress to enact a permanent replacement.
After the decision was announced, Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia sent letters to members of Congress lobbying for the passage of a legislative replacement, Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming said Monday.
Fleming added that the university has been reaching out to senators and representatives, including Georgetown alumni, to push for the passing of the Dream Act of 2017, which would provide a path for permanent residency to qualified undocumented immigrants, providing an alternative to DACA.
“We are committed. This is going to get done. We’re not going to have to worry about what happens after March 5th,” Fleming said. “I think the attitudes on Capitol Hill are changing. Having heard comments from a variety of members of Congress, I see people moving in the right direction.”
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and other administrators at the event called for the rest of the Georgetown community to come together and contribute to issues affecting undocumented students, while also urging undocumented students on campus to seek counsel as soon as possible.
For students applying for or renewing their DACA status before the Oct. 5th deadline, the university will facilitate free and anonymous legal services by contracting with Catholic Charities’ immigration legal services, according to University counsel Adam Adler.
Fleming also encouraged the students in attendance to participate in the Friends of Dreamers program, through which signed letters containing the stories of undocumented students are delivered to legislators on Capitol Hill. Fleming said the stories, which are more impactful than a phone call, are planned to be delivered by administrators and student beginning this week.
Georgetown reached out to other Jesuit colleges and universities to collaborate on the effort, according to Fleming.
Associate Director for Undocumented Student Services Arelis Palacios also called for students to stand by their peers by externalizing support for DACA and promting constructive dialogue. She offered to train student leaders on campus to help them achieve this.
“There are students who are directly impacted, who we communicate with very consistently, and then there are the allies, and the allies are really critical in this conversation in terms of how you can start to change the conversation about this on our campus,” Palacios said. “We are absolutely wanting these students to matriculate, we want them to be part of our campus, we see them as a necessary voice.”
Highlighting the university’s continued involvement with the issue for over a decade, Olson expressed his confidence in the university’s continued engagement with the issue.
“As time has moved on over the last several years, our approach as an institution has evolved, it has grown,” Olson said. “We have hard work to do together, I am confident we are up to the task.”
[…] called the terminiation of DACA “unconscionable” in a campuswide email, and has personally lobbied members of Congress to pass a permanent legislative replacement for the […]

The McDonough School of Business must work to integrate technological advances in global markets with the goal of educating competitive and innovative students, said McDonough School of Business Dean Paul Almeida.
With 22 years of experience at Georgetown University, and just over a month in his position, Almeida said he hopes to take full advantage of the tools and capabilities offered by the MSB, the rest of the Georgetown community and the greater Washington, D.C. community.
In an interview with The Hoya, Almeida described his experience leading the MSB so far and what his expectations and hopes are for the future of the school and its role within the university.
How was your first month as dean of the McDonough School of Business?
I didn’t expect any surprises and I didn’t get any surprises, but I think the thing that, if I look back, hits me the most is I see the first month as being a first, but important, step into the future. And I’m very excited about the future; I think we can be even more magnificent in a number of ways. So, I think there’s always a little bit of adjustment in the first month, but I was deputy dean of education and innovation, so it wasn’t a big stretch. But getting to know the undergrads when they come in as dean is different than getting to know the undergrads when they come in when you’re not dean. Welcoming the parents and each cohort and welcoming the faculty back, it has a different effect on you and you realize both the responsibility and the opportunity to make a difference, so that’s quite thrilling.
You have been at Georgetown for 22 years. How does it feel to come to such an important position at an institution that you have given so much to and that is such a big part of your life?
It’s wonderful. It’s one of many important positions in the school, and I said in my status school address that deans don’t make a school, and I mean it with all sincerity. It’s a combination of the faculty and the staff and the students and the alumni and the advisors who make the school. And, so the way I look at it is, my job is to be a good conductor, to choose the piece of music and share my vision and inspiration with other people and then facilitate their success. So it’s wonderful, but I take it as an opportunity, literally, to serve and I take it as an opportunity to work with lots of different stakeholders to move forward along a common path. I know so many of the stakeholders well, and I understand our school and our future well. I understand our role within the university, which is very important; I understand our role within Washington, D.C.; I understand our role within the Jesuit community. I’m gratified, I’m thrilled, and I’m excited and I do feel that responsibility as well.
How has your career prepared you to serve in this position?
One, I’m a strategy professor. I’ve not only been a strategy professor and taught at the undergraduate level and the MBA level and the executive level, I’ve held numerous seminars, well over 60, 70, with different companies and organizations domestic and international, big and small, and consulted with all these companies. And so strategy is kind of in my blood and my expertise and my passion. And the other thing that I’ve studied is innovation. And I think I’ve not just studied it, I’ve practiced it for many years.
The MSB has grown tremendously, yet you mentioned in an interview for the university’s communications team that business education, the “market realities,” are changing. How do you envision the MSB moving forward?
Maybe our students have to understand computer science a little better. Maybe our students need a little more exposure to the changes taking place in say, Goldman Sachs or Barclays or elsewhere. So maybe we need to have more experiential learning, maybe greater interaction with companies and what they’re doing. Maybe our students need to have a wider variety of electives possible that they wouldn’t have had before. And we’re going to launch this sort of journey of discovery with them and for them. So for the subject matter they learn, the interaction with businesses in the real worlds, and the process of learning. Should they have more flipped classes, for instance? Should we be using technology more aggressively? Now that’s obviously in the future, but we should keep asking these questions.
What programs and initiatives do you plan to implement in the short term?
We would like to enhance our global experiences, to some extent; I think that’s really important. We would like to definitely start on providing our students more opportunities with the School of Foreign Service and vice versa, so there’s more flexibility to build on the advantages of both schools and both sets of students. And I think in a very short time, we will announce steps in that direction.
In that same interview you mentioned that Georgetown and the MSB could be “smart” and “innovative” in its approach to the future. How does an institution conflate both qualities?
‘Smart’ means that we have to grow as an organization in terms of our faculty, in terms of our staff and our students, but that needs to be aligned with our strategy, in terms of how big different programs are, or which new programs we are introducing. And it also has to align very much with your financial situation, so that you can invest. You say you’re going to do this but you can actually invest and make a difference. So ‘smart’ means basically aligning your financials, your strategy in an organization in a world that continuously changes in a dynamic way. And ‘innovative,’ again, plays into change, and here we don’t just react to change, we create the change we want. Given that the world is changing, how can we find our distinctive place in that world?
Where does the Innovation Initiative that you oversaw as deputy dean fall into this?
We’ve moved it to the dean’s office. It was with me as deputy dean, but when I moved to the dean’s office, I brought it with me. And this year, we’re looking at two things in depth. First, we had five different initiatives last year, and for every one we’re actually going to implement at least two of the recommendations from every initiative. The worst thing you can do is plan and not do anything. But we’re also doing something called lifelong learning this year; it’s a new initiative. I know you’ve got a long way before you graduate, but you’re going to graduate when you are 22, and you’re probably going to retire when you’re 80, and the world’s going to change so much. We want the Georgetown experience to continue to be with you, so what we’re going to do is develop courses partly online, partly in person, combining alumni experts with Georgetown professors in a way that knits together communities around areas of interest.
What is your personal objective?
To make a positive difference to the school. I didn’t really seek this job, I can be honest in that. A few people said, ‘You really should think about it,’ and I said, ‘Look, let me think about it.’ And I was very happy in my previous job, and I loved the flexibility, and I loved all the different features, and I was thinking of starting a business using artificial intelligence, and I have my consulting. And I said, on the other hand, ‘If I feel God is leading me to this, if I can make a difference to the school, if my skills make a difference to the school, if my commitment and passion make a difference to the school, I suspect I won’t be able to be as happy as I was before, but I feel I could perhaps make a bigger difference.’

Foreign policy experts hashed out strategies to combat the rise of nuclear proliferation in rogue states, including more aggressive actions against North Korea, at an event hosted by the Alexander Hamilton Society Wednesday evening.
Former Pentagon official Michael Rubin and newly appointed Vice Dean of Georgetown College David Edelstein discussed the successes and failures of previous U.S.-led initiatives and forecasted future possibilities during a panel hosted by government professor Matthew Kroenig.
While the scholars agreed on more fronts than they disagreed, Rubin said the overreliance on diplomacy with rogue states is a culturally misinformed and Western tactic. He suggested that diplomatic measures should be coupled with military options.
“What I want to cast doubt on is this idea that diplomacy always works, and that it never hurts to talk,” Rubin said. “It becomes a mantra among both Democrats and Republicans, yet I would argue that it can be very condescending and culturally insensitive to engage with a sort of mirror-imaging that assumes that everyone approaches diplomacy the same way.”
Edelstein cautioned against the use of military force, emphasizing the limitations of American will in the international arena.
“If the alternative to diplomacy is the use of military force, then we should be reluctant and awfully careful about that alternative. Limited strikes may be able to set back nuclear programs, but at the same time they may only increase the incentive of those states to acquire nuclear weapons,” Edelstein said. “There are limits to even what the world’s most powerful country can accomplish.”
Turning to North Korea’s nuclear program, Rubin and Edelstein made clear that it is not in China’s interests to play the role of watchdog that the United States hopes it will. U.S. foreign policy goals have long focused on preventing North Korea from developing a nuclear warhead able to strike the United States and its allies.
“We thought we would see sincerity from China; we gave them a great deal of incentives in terms of technology and waivers and so forth. Just like the return address for Hezbollah is in Tehran, maybe we have to assume the return address of Pyongyang is in Beijing,” Rubin said.
Edelstein said China continues to benefit from U.S. unwillingness to act on North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.
“Anybody who thinks China is our friend in dealing with North Korea is delusional. The Chinese are quite content to see this issue as a continual thorn in our side,” Edelstein said.
Chinese leaders would only consider a more active role if the regional balance of power were upset, Rubin said.
“I would say we need to talk with Japan, and have the Japanese — who are more concerned about North Korea than even we are — about the possibility of new constitutions, and whether or not, in the spirit of deterrence, maybe it’s time for Japan to reconsider whether it should possess a nuclear weapon,” Rubin said.
Recognizing the instability expected by the emergence of a new nuclear power, Edelstein said a nuclear Japan could bring dangerous, unintended consequences.
“Decades of research show us that the period in which there are new nuclear states is a really dangerous period in international politics,” Edelstein said. “That new state is worried that they may not have many of those things, and it doesn’t yet have the secure second-strike capabilities that we relied on in the Cold War to have that deterrent relationship.”
Rubin suggested regime change should be the end goal of American policy toward North Korea “before the problem gets so much worse.”
The best way to avoid international nuclear conflict would be to rely on deterrence and eschew aggression toward North Korea, Edelstein said.
“My sense is that if [China’s] goal is to keep the regime in power, then the best way to prevent the North Koreans from actually thinking about using these nuclear weapons is by saying, ‘You know what, maybe we just can’t change this regime right now,’” Edelstein said.

The Georgetown University Law Center and the Georgetown University Medical Center formally launched the Health Justice Alliance, a partnership to share legal resources and medical research focused on low-income communities in Washington, D.C., at a panel on Wednesday.
The Health Justice Alliance, which began research work in 2016, works to provide legal assistance and advice in addition to medical care for low-income residents across the District. University President John J. DeGioia emphasized the importance of joint work between GUMC and GULC to panel attendants.
“There is an undeniable urgency to this work, to address pervasive and persistent health disparities facing our community today, disparities influenced by factors relating to food security, housing, education and access to healthcare, medical and legal challenges that demand collaborative, interdisciplinary, and community-based solutions,” DeGioia said.
Moderated by Edward Healton, GUMC’s executive vice president for health sciences, the panel was composed of representatives from both GUMC and the GULC, including Yael Cannon and Vicki Girard, GULC professors and co-directors of the Health Justice Alliance; Christopher King, director of the School of Nursing and Health Studies’ master’s degree in health systems administration; founding medical director of the Health Justice Alliance Eileen Moore; and Oswald Reid (MED ’20).
GULC Dean William Treanor introduced the panel, remarking on its three major goals of addressing underserved communities in the District, training the next generation of doctors and attorneys to work collaboratively, and performing research to evaluate best practices for future medical-legal partnerships.
“The Health Justice Alliance embodies the Georgetown ethos, the Jesuit ethos by fostering collaboration between lawyers, medical professionals and students from both arenas to care for the whole person,” Treanor said.
Moore said her patients inspired her to implement a medical-legal partnership at Georgetown. Specifically, after attempting to help an asthmatic patient whose condition was exacerbated by a broken window in her home and was receiving no assistance from landlords, Moore said she realized patients need legal help.
“So out of sheer desperation I went to a friend of mine who has those magic words like ‘esquire’ after her name,” Moore said. “Within a week there was glass in that window. So I very quickly came to realize the high, high value of the medical-legal partnership aspect of the Health Justice Alliance.”
Cannon credits Georgetown’s affiliation with healthcare providers across D.C. through the MedStar Hospital System as one of the strengths of the program, as it affords students the opportunity to work directly with populations affected by poverty.
“Georgetown is pretty remarkably positioned for this type of partnership. Both the law school and the medical center have an incredible presence in low-income communities in D.C., and we realized as we started talking across our campuses that we can do this work better if we do it together,” Cannon said.
The program focuses on underserved populations in order to help address and lessen racial health disparities in the District, according to King.
King said black D.C. residents are six times more likely to develop and die from diabetes and three times more likely to be obese than white D.C. residents.
Black men in the District are three times more likely to die from prostate cancer than white men, and black women in the District are 1.5 times more likely to die from breast cancer than white women, according to a July 2016 report to the D.C. Commission on African American Affairs to which King contributed.
“I tell my students that we can provide the best medical care in the world, but we can’t begin to address everything unless we rethink how systems and institutions are designed and rethink them in a holistic way,” King said.
Cannon added that the program works to achieve its goal of training the next generation of doctors and lawyers by helping students understand how to assess medical and legal needs from the beginning of their work with patients or clients.
“When these patients who are living in really extreme poverty come to the doctor, a med student goes into the patient room, does a regular checkup, checks for vitals, but can also check to see if there are unmet legal needs,” Cannon said. “If those needs are flagged, our law students can wrap that family in legal services and work as a team to problem-solve for these families and try to get them healthy.”

The enhanced Saturday GUTS service will run every 20 minutes from 9 a.m. to 7:40 p.m., making stops at Dupont Circle and grocery store Trader Joe’s in Foggy Bottom.
The enhanced service is a continuation of a pilot program launched last spring, which implemented a more frequent Saturday service to Dupont Circle from noon to 7 p.m. and the addition of the Trader Joe’s stop.
GUSA President Kamar Mack (COL ’19) and Vice President of Planning and Facilities Robin Morey announced the new service in a campus-wide email Tuesday.
The GUTS pilot program is funded through the reallocation of $36,000 previously dedicated to a late-night shuttle from Adams Morgan, that ran between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m. on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays; this service was cancelled due to the low levels of ridership.
GUSA Press Secretary Aaron Bennett (COL ’19) said low use inspired changes to the service.
“Our analysis showed that previous routes run on Saturdays had low ridership, so our team worked closely with Robin Morey to find and expand the routes that provide the most benefit to our campus,” Bennett said. “We are also implementing real-time tracking of ridership metrics so that we can provide the best GUTS service possible.”
Jack Pelose (COL ’19), vice chair for GUSA’s transportation policy committee, said the frequency of the new Saturday GUTS service is what sets it apart from previous services.
“This is a massive improvement over existing Saturday Dupont service, which ran only every 80 minutes and for far fewer hours of the day,” Pelose said. “The main goal of the improvements was to get bus service that runs frequently enough that students want to use it.”
GUSA Master Planning Chair Zac Schroepfer (MSB ’19) said the optimized GUTS service has experienced increased student demand since the spring pilot program.
“We are hoping that the expanded hours both in the morning and the evening will allow students to utilize this route not only for increased access to groceries at Trader Joes, but also allow students a larger range of recreational activities around the city during the weekend,” Schroepfer said.
The program, which is pending final approval Dec. 6, will be evaluated for its efficiency at the end of the school term.
“GUSA and the university will analyze the data about the enhanced Saturday GUTS service at the end of the semester and assess whether this is a good use of transportation resources,” Pelose said.

As a parent, I applaud your expanded Saturday service. I wonder if the University might consider full weekend service over Parents’ Weekend. It would certainly make getting to and from campus a lot easier for the old folks.

The McCourt School of Public Policy will introduce a Master in Data Science for Public Policy program next fall, increasing McCourt students’ access to data science.
The new program will be housed in the McCourt School, but will feature a core curriculum that is split between public policy courses in the McCourt School and analytics courses in the Graduate Analytics Program through the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
Paasha Mahdavi, Assistant Professor at the McCourt School, said creating the core curriculum was a difficult but crucial aspect of the process of developing the new MDSPP program.
“We’ve crafted a holistic curriculum that combines courses in computer science, statistics, economics, and political science to equip our students with cutting-edge computational, analytical, and governance skills,” Mahdavi wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Dean of the McCourt School Michael Bailey said that, based on trends in policymaking toward an increased use of data, the timing is right to introduce this new program.
“There’s such a need for evidence-based research and we want people to have the best resources for that, and McCourt has historically always been very strong in evidence-based and quantitative methods so we have a nice base,” Bailey said.
Todd Leen, director of the Graduate Program in Data Analytics, said the program would prepare students to tackle both urban and federal policy-making issues with an emphasis on data analytics.
“It’s in part due to this increased activity at the urban level, and it is in part due to the hope that these techniques can make it into ultimately federal policy-making — state and federal policy-making. The work I’m most aware of is at the urban level where cities have been looking for statistical data analysis and data referencing towards improving their operations,” Leen said.
Leen said Georgetown University’s MDSPP program is one of two to three policy analytics programs in the entire country and that its strong data analytics and public policy programs, coupled with its location in Washington, D.C. make this program ripe for success.
“We do have connections in the federal government, several in the Department of Commerce, we’ve placed students in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, so we have connections in the government that we should be able to use,” Leen said.
Bailey and Leen both expressed an interest in having students work on real-life problems through the program.
“What we want, and this will build up over time, is to have more client-based work and community-based work where we can match these students with real-world projects and get them to be seeing how this stuff works in practice,” Bailey said.
Mahdavi said that he hopes that this new program would allow students to make a difference in policy through their employment after graduating from the program.
“My biggest hope for this program 5-10 years down the road is to have a lasting impact on the public, private, non-profit and multilateral sectors through successfully placing our students in top employment outcomes,” Mahdavi wrote.
Leen said he hopes this new analytics program sets the stage for Georgetown to introduce other interdisciplinary analytics programs, such as a business analytics program through the McDonough School of Business.
“The vision would be sort of a center atmosphere in which there are public policy students and students that participate in this joint data science and public policy program, as well as hardcore data scientists and business people addressing a whole range of societal problems,” Leen said.
Bailey said he believed that the university as a whole could benefit from the resources used by this program, including speaker sessions and panels that would be open to the university as a whole.
“We’re hoping to do things of interest to people outside of the program. This is a university program we won’t start until next year, but it will definitely be used as a university resource,” Bailey said.
