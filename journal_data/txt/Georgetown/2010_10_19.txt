In response to what some view as the systematic weakening of the School of Foreign Service’s International Development certificate over the past year, Zara Khan (SFS ’07) is resigning from her role as program coordinator.
Khan said in an email to students pursuing the certificate, that although she was promised a position through the official Human Resources process, she has worked as an hourly, temporary employee for the past 18 months and as a volunteer for five weeks at the beginning of this semester.
In the email, Khan said that increased budget cuts were a factor in her resignation.
“The budget has been cut more than any other certificate. It was cut by more than 50 percent despite a doubling in student enrollment,” Khan said.
She added that the International Development certificate is currently the most popular certificate program in the School of Foreign Service with more than 80 students expected to graduate with it this year.
Rebecca English (SFS ’11) said she has a sincere interest in international development and hopes to pursue a career in the field after graduation this spring.
“The fact that the SFS offered the certificate was one of the key choices leading me to switch from [Georgetown] College after freshman year, because I felt that the opportunities [for] academic and career growth that the certificate offered were really impressive and would provide me with a good background to get involved in the development field,” English said.
The certificate is so popular, English said, because of the wide range of academic subjects it allows students to pursue.
“With my certificate, I chose to focus significantly on the impact of development on women, [and] so many of my classes were related to that,” English said. “I know other people who are in the certificate whose interests in international health, human security, the environment, democracy promotion and the like led them to focus heavily on those classes.”
Michael Lopesciolo (SFS ’13) said he feels that the certificate allows students to explore different options within the field.
“It’s a really well-rounded program, with a strong core balancing out a lot of flexibility on the part of the student,” Lopesciolo said. “It doesn’t `lock’ you into a single geographic area like the regional certificates, which can be intimidating. As a Catholic university . with a very heavy international focus, I think the disparities between the first and third worlds are something that a lot of Georgetown students really care about.”
Khan encouraged students to continue expressing their concerns about the weakening of the certificate, which she attributed to the removal of requirements and mandatory internships.
“Time and again, current students and alumni assert that the certificate was crucial to their careers in international development,” Khan said. “Current students and alumni should seek explanations as to why the certificate has been weakened, and they should ask for guidance from faculty and administrators as to how to strengthen the certificate.I
Khan said that she will continue supporting the certificate as an alumna and has decided to pursue other career options in international development.
“My current plans are to work with a [nongovernmental organization] that aims to increase food security by helping entrepreneurial men and women in Rwanda build businesses that create income, opportunity and economic growth for their families, their communities and their country,” Khan said.
Lopesciolo added that Khan’s reputation and the quality of the programming and resources preceded itself.
“[Khan] was incredibly friendly and easy to talk to,” Lopesciolo said. “I was really looking forward to getting to know her more in the upcoming years.”

The Georgetown Public Library reopened Monday at its original location on R Street, three years after a debilitating fire forced the branch to close its doors for repairs.
Now, the library boasts a third floor, a reading terrace overlooking Book Hill Park, a large children’s room, a space designed specifically for teens, environmentally-friendly flooring made of renewable materials, 40 computers and handicap ramps, among others.
In addition, the $16 million renovation successfully restored much of the library’s original historic furniture and materials. The third-floor Peabody Room, which is larger than the original room destroyed in the fire, has been restored and refurbished with the original bookcases, tables and chairs that were salvaged from the fire and repaired. The library’s new woodwork and furniture was created in the style of the original 1935 library, to preserve the historic neo-Georgian architectural style.
The opening of the new library is the result of three years of restoration efforts. The renovations were completed on time and on budget, according to Tracy Sumler, the library’s branch manager.
“I am relieved and happy that it is finally open,” Sumler said. “There was a lot of nervous energy moving in, but now we can all breathe a sigh of relief.”
The opening of the Georgetown Library at its original location led to the closing of the interim Georgetown Library, at 3307 M St., next to Qdoba, on Sept. 25. While the staff of the interim library was sad to leave, “everyone has been saying how great the new library is,” Sumler said.
Public reception has been positive. “People who have been coming in have really been overwhelmed,” Sumler said.
Special collections librarian Jerry McCoy, who played a large role in restoring and reprocessing the library’s Peabody collection, recalls being “absolutely traumatized” by the fire, which severely damaged the library’s Peabody Room along with the room’s historic books, maps, photos, manuscript collections and 44 pieces of artwork.
Following the fire, materials that were water damaged were immediately placed in freezer trucks to prevent molding and sent to Texas, where they were freeze-dried, according to McCoy. The 444 boxes of restored materials were shipped back to the library to be reprocessed.
A complete restoration of the Peabody’s art collection will cost $125,000, according to McCoy. McCoy said that while everything can be conserved, only three of the 44 paintings have been restored, due to generous private donations. The artwork is on display in the new Peabody Room along with the original furniture that McCoy said he is adamant on restoring.

With only two weeks to go until the midterm elections, and voters across the country seeking to make their voices heard, the Georgetown University College Democrats and College Republicans are ramping up their efforts to encourage fellow students to vote.
The expected average rate of youth turnout during the midterm elections is usually between 20 and 25 percent. These numbers vary significantly from the 49.3 to 54.5 percent of young Americans who voted in 2008, as reported by The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement.
At a town hall meeting at the Newseum with The George Washington University law students on Oct. 6, President Obama emphasized the importance of the youth vote.
“When you’re talking to your friends and neighbors and asking them to commit to vote, that’s the kind of thing that you should be talking about,” Obama said.
Political groups on campus have been heavily involved in energizing fellow students with voter registrations, volunteer efforts and awareness programs. Earlier this month, the College Democrats completed their annual non partisan Residence Hall Voter Registration and Absentee Ballot Drive. According to a press release, during the two-week drive 156 new voters were registered and 512 students received absentee ballot applications.
“We try to make it as easy as possible for students, and we’ve had lots of people tell us how much they appreciate our help and our encouragement,” GUCD Membership Director Hannah Lomax-Vogt (COL ’12) said in the release.
College Democrats President Bryan Woll (COL ’12) said that he believed that most young voters will support the Democratic Party in November, which will bolster the Democrats’ cause.
“The dissatisfaction that has boiled up the past few months is largely confined to older segments of the
population, while many young people still see President Obama and his administration as agents of social change,” Woll wrote in an email.
“I think that young people will continue to support Obama and the Democrats, because they have delivered results on issues that are important to our generation.”
Talking to people about voting has been the focus of other GUCD activities, including campaign trips and phone banking sessions for Democratic candidates. Earlier this month, the group spent a weekend campaigning in Philadelphia, and another is planned for Kentucky this coming weekend.
The College Republicans also recognize the importance of youth turnout in the upcoming elections, but believe that many Georgetown students will favor the Republicans.
“There’s an understandable sense that Obama and his allies in Congress are unresponsive to the American people and that they will make their change happen regardless of whether the majority of Americans are in favor of it,” GUCR Chief of Staff Kevin Preskenis (COL ’12) wrote in an email. “This doesn’t sit well with Georgetown students who have a particularly keen understanding of how government ought to function.”
To encourage voters to support the Republican candidates at the polls, the GUCR is actively campaigning in New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia. The campaigns focus on supporting the states’ Republican congressional candidates in hopes that the party will be able to gain enough seats in Congress to oust the Democrats’ control on Capitol Hill.
“We are trying to remain cautiously optimistic for November,” Preskenis said. “Republican enthusiasm in recent months has reached close to 60 percent, which is the highest average Gallup has found in a midterm election year for either party since 1994. I think we’ll see this with the younger vote.”

F. William McElroy, professor emeritus in the economics department, died Oct. 13 at age 71 following a battle with lung cancer that fatally weakened his immune system.
“He was a wonderful man with a thorough understanding of both mathematics and economics,” said professor emeritus of economics George Viksnins, McElroy’s longtime friend and tennis opponent. “His courses were really quite technical.”
McElroy earned his B.A. and M.A. in mathematics at University College, Dublin before he studied at Georgetown and earned his Ph.D. in 1967. In the 1970s, he became a full professor and department chair.
He was a founder of the Main Campus Retired Faculty Association, and was an active member of the University Faculty Senate.
McElroy’s legacy is one of intellectual strength but also of personality and empathy for those less fortunate.
“He had a very nice sly sense of humor [that] was not always adequately appreciated by his students because he was also too demanding at the same time,” Viksnins said.
According to Viksnins, McElroy was deeply concerned with social justice.
“He was very into social responsibility,” Viksnins said, citing his late friend’s involvement in the nongovernmental organization Oxfam. “He also went many, many weekends to Martha’s Table, where he helped serve lunch for the homeless. So he not only talked about equality, he planned to do something about it.”
Viksnins also attested to the importance of faith to McElroy and said he frequently attended Mass. “He and I often drank beer together, and he was very serious about Lent, and so he decided to forgo his favorite Irish Guinness stout [that] he and I would share after our tennis matches.”
McElroy is survived by his wife, son and daughter in addition to two siblings and three grandchildren.

The university dropped by 26 spots in the U.S. News and World Report international rankings this year, leaving a tremendous disparity between its international and national rank.
Georgetown placed 21st on U.S. News and World Report’s rankings for national universities, but 155th in the international rankings. Nationally, Georgetown is ranked between Emory University and the University of California, Berkeley. Yet internationally, Berkeley ranks 28th, whereas Emory ranks 107th. The top institutions remain unchanged, with Harvard University appearing first nationally and second internationally behind the University of Cambridge, and Yale University placing third in both rankings. Georgetown administrators did not offer an opinion to account for Georgetown’s comparatively low international rank.
“We have never cared much about these rankings and so I don’t have any major reaction to them,” Charles Deacon, dean of undergraduate admissions, said in an email. “I am not familiar with the international rankings, which probably reflect more on graduate and research influences.”
The international rankings, which are based on the Quacquarelli Symonds World University Rankings, are calculated using six criteria: academic peer review, student-to-faculty ratio, citations per faculty member, employer review, international faculty and international students. Georgetown’s scores ranged from an 18 as the international faculty score to a 75 as the employer review score. The composite score was a 53.1 out of 100.
While Georgetown boasts students from over 40 different countries, it is only ranked 208th based on international students. Georgetown does not appear in the top 300 schools based on international faculty members.
Last year, Georgetown ranked 129th internationally and had an overall score of 63.4. But while
Georgetown lags in the international rankings, it has improved in the national rankings due to changing criteria.
Georgetown officials cite the introduction of the high school guidance counselor information as crucial for Georgetown’s improved standings in the national rankings, as opposed to the international rankings.
“It’s worth noting that the methodology changed this year to reflect the views of high school counselors and that was an important factor for Georgetown’s ranking,” university spokeswoman Julie Bataille said in an email.
Deacon noted that the addition of the counselor evaluation reflected the reality of college admissions, as high school counselors, not just rankings, often influence students’ decisions of where to apply.
“The significance of that is that it reflects the views of the `marketplace’ [that is the] high school counselors and the students that are applying to college today,” Deacon said.
According to U.S. News and World Report, Georgetown is tied for sixth in the counselor rankings along with Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University and Johns Hopkins University.

While a food store will be returning to 1211 Potomac St., it will not be the Philly Pizza & Grill remembered by students. Rather, the new establishment will be a prepared food store that will close much earlier than its predecessor and is not permitted to sell pizza, among other regulations imposed by the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs..
“Philly Pizza is not reopening,” Mehmet Kocak, owner of the property, told The Hoya. “The new store is called Go Fresh. Everything is new. It’s a new concept under new management.”
After his business was forced to shut down by the Board of Zoning Adjustment in March, Kocak filed an application to transform the building into a prepared food shop.
The new restaurant differs dramatically from Philly Pizza, an establishment that had angered residents due to excessive noise, trash and rowdy behavior by late-night customers.
The final consent form, which was approved by the Board of Zoning Adjustment and Kocak’s attorney, explicitly forbids the sale of pizza at the building. The new restaurant will not be allowed to cook raw ingredients not meant for immediate consumption, including meat and dough. The form also limits operation times between 6 and 1 a.m. The new restaurant will stop serving food at 12:45 a.m.
In addition, Kocak said that the new restaurant will not have delivery, so as to avoid blocking the street and alleys with delivery cars. Any customers eating outside of the restaurant will be considered loiterers and penalties will be enforced by the Metropolitan Police Department. Kocak agreed to promptly report the loiterers to MPD on the consent form.
Local opinion remains strongly opposed to the restaurant, despite the new regulations. Ward 2 Councilman Jack Evans has publicly vowed to shut down the establishment, while presumptive Mayor Vincent Gray said that he would hold the zoning and regulation agencies accountable to the local citizens.
Despite the negative sentiment, Kocak remains hopeful his restaurant will win over area residents.
“We’re going to be working with the neighborhood. We don’t want any complaints,” Kocak said.
Students are skeptical of the new store, and the consequences of the regulations.
“Philly P’s hasn’t been the same since it moved my freshman year,” Brendan Gottschall (COL ’12) said. Gottschall added that he did not intend to visit the new restaurant.

The beginning of the semester has been a turbulent time for black students at Georgetown, with racist graffiti and a climbing rope that was initially deemed to be a possible noose found under Healy. The incidents and the university’s response have only intensified the discussion about diversity on campus. THE HOYA sat down with Carolyn Chambers (COL ’11), president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People’s Georgetown chapter, to discuss the incidents and broader issues of diversity on campus, as well as the NAACP’s role as a political organization defending minority opinions on campus
What do you feel the university has done well and poorly, in terms of diversity, in recent years, including the implementation of the Diversity Initiative?
The Diversity Initiative is a big step, but there’s a lot of things that the university could improve upon to make it a stronger program. I recognize that it’s here, and a great thing, but there’s a lot of bureaucracy in the whole process [that needs to be traversed] in order for the initiative to pass. Thus, it hasn’t happened as quickly as I would have liked it to.
I think we would appreciate a greater push for recruitment of minority faculty, and the encouragement of faculty to acknowledge diversity within their educational spheres. New classes don’t need to be added, but since there’s limitations, we have to work with what we have. We’d all appreciate it if the faculty would help students hear the unique, diverse voices in the classroom.
Georgetown hasn’t done as much as it could do in developing a diverse class. It seems that the incoming class is very diverse, but I’ve heard that statistically, the percentage of students from diverse backgrounds has been about the same. Georgetown could do a lot more in terms of fostering interest from different groups of students.
What do you think is the most prominent issue facing minority students in the United States of America?
Economic empowerment is the largest issue facing the people represented by the NAACP. For minorities, the issue of finding a job that pays enough income to support a family and suitable lifestyle has been a struggle not only decades in the making, but centuries, maybe even millennia. I feel like economic empowerment can manifest itself in different ways. It can be thought of in terms of the environment in which people grow up, such as the young children who grew up in weak neighborhoods that don’t have good schools, or in terms of education, stretching from kindergarten all the way to college.
I feel [that] money and the lack of it, as well as the lack of opportunity to participate in our consumerist, capitalist society and economy, proves difficult. For many minorities, they find that they’re not located on the same playing field as the rest of the nation.
I think the university does a good job of providing jobs, opportunities and work-study programs to minority students. The university does offer a decent amount of financial aid. In my own opinion, it’s not as much actually attending school that proves difficult to many students. It’s paying for all the things that at first seem little, until you find yourself trying to pay for all of them, such as the extra quarter added to doing laundry, and other random things. These things are extras, but they’re amenities that are hard to pay for. . There’s an assumption here that everybody just simply has money in their pockets, that they can afford all of these things, while the basic fact is many students here cannot.
How do you feel about the university’s response to the discriminatory graffiti and the rope that was described as a “possible noose”?
I applaud the university for announcing the noose, and then creating a community meeting in order to discuss it, almost as soon as the noose got announced. I had never seen anything like that before in my years here at Georgetown, or experienced the university admit something, or reach out to the community. Now unfortunately, that meeting was not well attended, but that’s a whole other issue – the lack of attention and care provided by the student body.
The students don’t necessarily become complacent, but they become comfortable in the situation surrounding them. Despite that, I think the university did a good job in hosting the event. A lot of things were, however, left intentionally vague, in the name of security, which I guess theoretically makes sense.
I think that the university might have been able to do other things, in order to handle the situation better, but I think the bigger situation is that we as a campus need to change our focus from being reactive to being proactive. I think that in order to prevent situations like this from happening again, to be more proactive, we need to try to pass all of the Diversity Initiative. Despite the fact that the noose proved not to be a noose, there is no excuse for the graffiti that already existed down there, near the rope.
Some academics believe that modern social activism manifested online doesn’t carry the same weight as the hierarchical structuring of the Civil Rights Movement in the ’60s, which operated through churches and other organizations. How do you respond to that?
We have to realize that times are changing. We can’t do things in the same manner and capacity that we could do things in the past. We can still do grassroots programs, and work through church networks as the NAACP did in the past, but it’s a different era, with amazing new technology – and we’d be silly not to take advantage of it. We can take advantage of things such as social networking, while using grassroots networks, and be even more effective. Social networking can help you reach people that you couldn’t possibly reach before.
Think about nowadays, when groups work together between California and New York. With social networking, planning between the different parts of this nation, and throughout the world, is so much easier than it ever was in the past. All those things can be coordinated, just by making a status, and having Twitter accounts re-Tweet it. People can send a message just by changing their profile pictures, and that’s the beautiful thing about social networks. It connects people around the world in a second, in a way thought impossible before.
We need to realize that times have changed, and we need to use all of our resources. With the black community in general, it makes sense that organizations like the NAACP could only work by working through churches, because that was the most effective way to reach out to the black community. It was, and is, a big value, but as you know, people don’t go to church as often as they used to. We can motivate all of those people, as well as people that didn’t go to church, all by using social networks to rally people.

Bikes have been the latest targets for theft on campus, with six bicycles stolen in the first two weeks of October. A total of nine bikes have been stolen since the beginning of the semester, revealing a climb from last year’s numbers.
With a Department of Public Safety investigation underway, DPS Associate Director Joseph Smith said the incidents have been campus-wide and that no suspects or witnesses have been identified.
According to Smith, the investigation has concluded that blame for the thefts does not lie with the owners. Each of the missing bikes had been secured by their owners and the thief cut the lock, Smith said.
The thefts were met with surprise by bicycle-owner Marybeth Arcodia (COL’14), who locks up her bike regularly near the Intercultural Center.
“I am not concerned that someone would break the lock [and try to steal my bike],” Acordia said.
Other students, such as Vedrana Durakovic (GRD ’11), said that while they were aware of the ongoing thefts, they were not concerned because they locked their bikes on a regular basis.
Bike thefts have been common on campus in the past, but the current frequency is unusual. In both September 2009 and September 2010, three bikes were reported missing. During the entire month of October 2009, however, only three bike thefts were reported – significantly fewer than the six that have already occurred this October.
Despite the recent incidents, the issue of bike theft on campus has declined to a fraction of what it was just three years ago, thanks to security measures implemented by DPS, Smith said.
“We implemented a bike registration and lock sales a couple of years ago as a response to bike thefts on campus,” Smith said in an email. “We also have our patrol officers direct their attention to problem areas, according to our crime analysis of the incidents.”
Other measures include the Bark-Up campaign, which aims to encourage students to report criminal activity and the ongoing improvements to the surveillance camera system.
Smith said students can also help prevent crime, and emphasized that all bike owners on campus should buy high-quality locks and learn to utilize them properly. He also advised students to check on their bikes frequently.
“In general we can all help out by being vigilant, and students can help out by noting any suspicious behavior and calling DPS,” Smith said.
Smith stressed that while DPS has been handling the issue, suspicious behavior should be reported immediately.

As the admissions cycle heats up, high school seniors aren’t the only ones vying for sought-after spots at universities like Georgetown. Often, the procedure for selecting their next instructors can be just as complex.
While some universities have turned to the national ranking of an applicant’s alma mater when hiring faculty, at Georgetown the process remains more individualized. Each department hires separately and no universal standards have been applied university-wide.
At some institutions, the national ranking of the universities from which a candidate received their degree from is a determinant in the process, according to Inside Higher Ed. This is not always the case on the Hilltop, however.
“Faulty hiring is done by the respective academic units and departments based upon their own needs and criteria,” university spokeswoman Julie Bataille said.
James Reardon-Anderson, senior associate dean of the School of Foreign Service, said that the institutional background where an applicant has studied or taught could be a significant indicator of their potential or quality.
“[This] indicates that someone else has already vetted and promoted the candidate,” he said. Chester Gillis, dean of the College, added that this was especially important in terms of candidates’ previous teaching experience.
“If a candidate comes from Harvard University as opposed to `University of Nowhere,’ the Harvard candidate is likely to be favored,” Gillis said.
Gillis said that depending on certain specialties, a candidate coming from a smaller or lesser-known school could be as equally a viable candidate if that school is known for its prominence and quality in a particular field, however.
“We only look for the best and brightest,” Gillis said.
Though these standards apply across the different schools, the department to which the candidate is applying still plays a key role when vetting candidates. Depending on the department, professors may occasionally be invited to teach a lecture or instruct a class to help the hiring committee with the selection. Nevertheless, this depends on the discretion of the individual department.
Reardon-Anderson said that while searching for viable candidates, both the SFS and Georgetown as a whole “consider the quantity and quality of published research or Ph.D. dissertation, promise for future scholarly productivity, proven or prospective quality as a teacher, and collegiality, or promise to make a positive contribution to the academic and scholarly community.”
But with no university-wide rubric for hiring individuals, each department decides how much weight to place on the different components of the application.
“Letters of recommendation are highly weighted because the ways these students and candidates worked with their mentors and professors are highly regarded,” Gillis said.
The university’s Affirmative Action Plan, the Main Campus Initiative on Diversity and Inclusiveness and the Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs require that the university make strong efforts to advertise to, recruit and employ qualified candidates, particularly those from minority backgrounds and women according to the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action’s website.
The website highlights specific hiring procedures that must be followed in accordance with these affirmative action requirements. Recruitment reports must be submitted to IDEAA at the beginning and end of the hiring process. The reports are used to help identify the diversity of those involved in the interviewing process and review the selection process as a whole.
The lack of a standard barometer for accepting candidates has led some students to be dissatisfied with professors, however. Angel Humphrey (SFS ’12) recalled taking a sociology course with one instructor specializing in a different field; she said she believed the professor was unqualified to teach the class.
“I learned absolutely nothing [from this professor], and it really began to hurt me in upper level sociology classes where it is assumed that I know things [that] I never learned. I don’t think that’s fair and its hurt me academically,” she said.
Still, other students accepted what they saw as the reality of professor quality: all universities had some better and some worse instructors, a phenomenon they said was not unique to Georgetown.
“[I’ve never had a bad professor] – however, that doesn’t mean some haven’t been much better than others. Some of my professors can be dull or are unable to communicate effectively, yet the professors make up for this by showing that they actually care about their students,” Michael Goulet (COL ’12) said.

When former Georgetown professor Mario Vargas Llosa was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature on Oct. 7, his one-time colleague Serafina Hager saw the announcement as a long-awaited triumph for the Peruvian writer.
“I’m so excited about Mario. Every year I was waiting for him to win the Nobel Prize, and this year he finally did,” said Hager, former dean of the Faculty of Language and Linguistics, who worked with Vargas Llosa while he was at Georgetown.
The Swedish Academy, the committee that chooses Nobel winners, praised Vargas Llosa “for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual’s resistance, revolt and defeat,” according to the official website of the Nobel Prize.
Vargas Llosa taught at Georgetown in 1994 as a distinguished writer-in-residence and again in 1999 as a visiting professor. He first arrived at the university when the FLL established an International Writers Workshop for incoming students. Over the summer students were asked to read a work by an influential international writer. The workshop’s first selection, Vargas Llosa’s novel “The Storyteller” (1987) told of the clash of tribal societies with modern life in Peru, Vargas Llosa’s country of birth.
“Although he was such a famous writer even then, he paid such close attention to the students. He took the time to give comments on their papers, he was always there. That really is the mark of a good teacher,” Hager said. “He’s given a great deal of time to the school and his students.”
“The students loved him,” said professor Thomas Walsh who served as chair of the Spanish and Portuguese department when Vargas Llosa taught. “I had to go down to his classroom and almost be like a bouncer because so many people wanted to take his class.”
Vargas Llosa received an honorary degree from Georgetown and joined the university faculty in 2001 as a member of the Spanish and Portuguese department.
“That’s where the close connection comes from,” Hager said. “The amazing feature of Mario’s personality is he doesn’t forget where he’s from. He doesn’t forget his friends. . That’s what really impresses me about him. He has that human side.”
Vargas Llosa is the author of more than 30 novels, plays and essays, but he is known as a renaissance man and is also a critic, journalist and politician. He ran for president of Peru in 1990, and though he was unsuccessful, his foray into politics deeply influenced his writing.
“I think writers are citizens too, you know, and have the moral obligation to participate in the civic debate, in the debate about the solutions to the problems that the societies face,” Vargas Llosa said in an interview on the Nobel Prize website.
“If you believe in democracy, democracy is participation, and I don’t think writers or artists or intellectuals should exonerate themselves of this moral obligation to participate,” he added.
Vargas Llosa’s interest and involvement in the world around him shines through in his writings, according to his admirers.
“He’s a thorough researcher and he’s very much involved in digging into political issues. He wanted to experience everything . and that underlines the noblest characteristic of a writer,” Hager said. “I feel honored and privileged to have known him.”

The impact of the recession has been especially hard on minority communities and those lacking a college degree in D.C., a city already plagued by one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation, according to a new report by the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute
The Oct. 13 report states that there has been a marked increase of unemployment among blacks and high school graduates in D.C. According to the report, unemployment for those without a high school degree or only a high school diploma is around 20 percent, as opposed to 4.2 percent for those who have graduated from college. The importance of higher education particularly affects blacks: 80 percent of white residents above the age of 25 have a college degree, compared to 21 percent of black residents.
Such numbers could be
attributed to a variety of factors, including race, socioeconomic status and education, according to Mike Schaub, executive director of the Career Education Center.
“These variables must be considered in tandem with the number of job opportunities at the local level. Students graduating with a college degree are at an advantage when seeking good paying jobs during a difficult economy,” Schaub said.
The situation is uniquely difficult for high school graduates in D.C.
“The D.C. Metro area job market contains many jobs that require advanced education,” Schaub said.
Schaub said that college students also have more resources to help find employment than high school graduates. The problem is not limited to those that do not have a degree, however.
According to the report, unemployment among blacks in D.C. in 2009 was 15.6 percent, a growth in unemployment of over 50 percent, from 2008’s 10.4 percent. Blacks constitute a majority of D.C.’s population, but their employment rate dropped from 53 percent in 2008 to 49.5 percent in 2009, according to the report. In contrast, the employment rate for whites rose from 77 to 78 percent.
D.C.’s Latino population also suffered tremendously last year, according to the report. The Latino unemployment rate increased the most out of any group in D.C., with a rise from 4.7 percent in 2008 to 8.4 percent in 2009.
The statistics for blacks and Latinos in D.C. stand in contrast with white D.C. residents, whose unemployment rate was only 4.1 percent in 2009.
The recent increase in unemployment among blacks in D.C. is only indicative of larger trends, however. According to the report, blacks’ job conditions have worsened continuously since the 1980s, even in periods when the city’s economy was growing .

Lloyd Cohen is not afraid of controversy. So when he drew supply and demand curves for human body parts on a whiteboard to illustrate the benefits of a market for organs, he did so with the confidence of someone who has been promoting the idea for over two decades.
“We have this crazy system now in which these vital organs are being fed to the worms,” said Cohen, a professor of economics law at George Mason University.
He presented his solution in a lecture at Georgetown on Monday: a market for human organs. The basic premise of the proposal, he said, is a very simple position.
“If you pay people for something, they are more likely to give it to you than if you don’t.”
According to Cohen, one of the major problems with the current system is that the decision of organ donation is often left up to others – parents, spouses or even hospitals.
“There’s something kind of distasteful about that,” he said.
He also takes fault with the way organs are currently distributed by the nonprofit United Network for Organ Sharing.
“The way that organs are currently allocated does not fit some great Platonic ideal,” he said. “That’s nonsense.”
Cohen’s plan would allow people to opt into a program in which they would be paid $5,000 for each of their vital organs after their death. The money would go either to their estate or to a designated beneficiary.
“You basically sign up for a contingent life insurance plan of what could be up to $30,000,” he said.The organs could then be distributed either by sale or by the same system in place now.
Cohen also responded to many common criticisms of a market for organs, including the oft-cited perception that poverty would coerce some into selling their organs. But, he said, in his system, organs can only be harvested after death.
“Dead people are neither rich nor poor. They are simply dead.”
Cohen didn’t take issue with many who find the idea of an organ market shallow.
“It is shallow,” he said. “Economics is a shallow discipline.”
But he maintains that the principles of economics still can and should be applied to organs.
“It’s not something that’s very mainstream,” said Jeffrey Niedermaier (COL ’14), a member of Hoyas for Liberty, which co-sponsored the event along with the Healthcare Executives of Georgetown University and the Georgetown University Lecture Fund.
“But I hope people just learn to look at things from a different angle,” Niedermaier said.”

Georgetown University Student Association Vice President Jason Kluger (MSB ’11) announced Sunday that funding has been restored for the Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle weekend bus service, after a severe shortage in reserves was discovered late last spring.
The funding for the weekend GUTS buses, which operate via Abe’s Transportation, came from a significant pledge last year by the GUSA Fund and a new influx of money that was originally set aside for the College Readership Program. Kluger said GUSA used the newly available money supply to finish off the funding for the weekend buses only after the readership program was discontinued due to a lack of financial support from other sources.
“That doesn’t mean [the readership program] is dead. It’s one of those issues I want to dive into with the [Student Activities Fee and Endowment] funds,” Kluger said.
According to Kluger, sufficient funds remain to relaunch the weekend GUTS bus service this coming weekend, once GUSA has followed through with the Center for Student Programs and Abe’s Transportation regarding the signing of the contract.
The financial backing for weekend GUTS buses will only last through this semester, however.
“In the short run, we put the money toward the GUTS buses for this semester so that the students don’t foot the bill for something the entire Georgetown community uses,” Kluger said.
He said he hopes for future collaboration with the administration in the spring, when new plans for funding the GUTS buses must be finalized.
At their meeting Sunday afternoon in Healy Hall, GUSA also unanimously passed the Ad-Hoc Recommendations Enactment Amendments (AREA) Act, a move to boost efficiency in the student association.
The AREA Act is a reform bill intended to enact the recommendations of the Speaker’s Ad-Hoc Advisory Committee on GUSA Continuity and Efficacy, which convened last spring.
Committee chairman and former GUSA Speaker Adam Talbot (COL ’12) described the AREA Act as the end product of a six-month review to enhance the institutional strength of the senate. “Most importantly, this act will extend to the other committees of the senate the same tools that make Finance and Appropriations such a powerful mechanism for realizing the general student interest,” Talbot said
The committee was comprised of Talbot, Senate Speaker Adam Mortillaro (COL ’12), Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13), Colton Malkerson (COL ’12), and then-Sen. Geraldine Miranda (SFS ’13). The task force also included representatives from various student organizations such as
ask & Bauble, Georgetown Emergency Medical Response Service, Philodemic Society and International Relations Club.
Tenets of the bill focus on elevating the senate body’s efficiency. Some of these elements include increasing the number of committee members from five to seven, allowing the Student Life Committee to absorb the Housing, Facilities and Technology Committee as well as expanding the Ways and Means Committee to include committee progress evaluation and oversight.
According to Gustafson, “One of the most important parts of the Area Act bill is making more people available to each committee to get stuff done.”
Gustafson also said that it was a good idea to make the Community Building and Outreach Committee responsible for alumni outreach and communication.
For the GUTS bus issue at the meeting, Kluger concluded, “I don’t think students should have to pay for something that everyone [in the Georgetown community] can use.”

In a dramatic decrease from last year, only two students in the School of Foreign Service scored high enough on the Oct. 7 exam to place out of the SFS’s required Map of the Modern World course.
Last October, 65 SFS students tested out of Map of the Modern World, which was a significant increase from that of previous years. The high passing rate added fuel to student criticism of the changes James Reardon-Anderson, senior associate dean of the SFS and a Sun Yat-Sen Professor of Chinese Studies, made to the course when he took over the helm from Keith Hrebenak, a professorial lecturer in the SFS, beginning last fall.
Drew Peterson (SFS ’10), who chaired the working group established by the SFS Academic Council to examine the new course, said the exam result may not in and of itself be a means to judge the nature of the exam.
“It is impossible to evaluate this year’s exemption exam on the pass rate alone,” he wrote in an email, “though it does seem more fitting that [two students], rather than 65, be exempted from the School’s mandatory geography requirement.”
Student concerns about the class’s focus linger in response to Reardon-Anderson’s revisions, which placed greater emphasis on physical geography and earth science.
“The new passing rate means nothing. … The same concerns about the class still exist from last year,” said Josh Mogil (SFS ’11), president of the SFS Academic Council. “It is my perception that everyone in the dean’s office is hoping that this [student response] just goes away.”
Reardon-Anderson, however, maintains that last year’s changes were sensible shifts in the syllabus in the first place.
“I believe that physical geography is an approach to international affairs that has largely been neglected, to the detriment of students who are going out into the world,” he said.
The previous version of the course, he said, had other flaws as well.
“[The previous version] was really designed as a course in the map of the colonial and post-colonial world,” he said. “It paid virtually no attention whatsoever to North America, Europe, Russia, China and Japan. I thought that was not in the students’ best interest.”
He added that about three-quarters of student comments from the past year’s course evaluations were positive, and that he had added more specific case studies in response to the criticism.
Students’ interest in the changes to Map has faded somewhat since last year, when Reardon-Anderson’s move drew complaints that he was damaging a curricular institution and ignoring student concerns; more than 700 students joined a Facebook group named “Take Back Map of the Modern World.”
In a viewpoint in THE HOYA, Tom Zuzelo (SFS ’11) explained one of the strands of criticism.
“Judging from Reardon-Anderson’s lecture notes and his own comments,” he wrote at the time, “this survey course has been watered down and transformed into a `Rocks for Jocks’ crash course on earth sciences.”
But concerns persist among Mogil and other students in the SFS.
“It’s not about the old class versus the new class anymore,” Mogil said. “It’s about what the best Map class would be. . I look forward to addressing this issue with the deans in a cooperative and constructive way.”
The working group of students and alumni organized last year is continuing to study the changes. According to Peterson, the group is waiting for the SFS administration to distribute a survey it has prepared to the students who took the new Map course last year. If the Office of the Dean does so within the next month, the team should be able to release its final report before the next group of students begins to take the 1-year-old class next semester.
The reaction of new freshmen to the emphases they saw on the exemption exam were mostly favorable.
“I think the vast majority of what was on the test made sense,” Evan Smith (SFS ’14) said. “I think, though, that there was undue emphasis on some topics, like trade winds. . If you didn’t know the Tropic of Capricorn from the Tropic of Cancer, you were guaranteed to miss five questions.”
He added that he had heard about last year’s high pass rate but was not aware of the disputes over the curriculum.
Mary Oeftering (SFS ’14) said that she was satisfied with the test, although she added jokingly that since she planned to major in science, technology and international affairs, she might not be representative of most SFS students.
“I’m not completely aware of what was on [the exam] before, but it seemed to me that everything on there was basic, fundamental ideas that everyone going into foreign service should know,” she said.
