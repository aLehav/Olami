Georgetown accepted a record-low 15.4 percent of students to the Class of 2021, an overall 3,313 out of 21,465 applicants.
The 15.4 percent acceptance rate marks a full point percentage drop from the rates of the last five years, which hovered between 16.4 percent and 16.6 percent.
Of the total accepted applicants, 931 were accepted in the early action cycle while 2,382 were accepted in the regular cycle.
The applicant pool this year also marked the largest pool in Georgetown’s history, topping the previous high of 20,111 applicants in 2012.
The Office of Undergraduate Admissions sent out acceptance letters for the regular application cycle Friday.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (CAS ’64, GRD ’69) attributed the increased applicant pool to the school’s focus on the individual student and a national spotlight on Washington, D.C., during the 2016 presidential election.
“We did not do anything different to increase the pool. In fact, we actively try not to increase it, because we really would like it to be representing people who really are interested and are willing to go through the extra effort,” Deacon said. “Even though we make it harder for people, the pool goes up, which is good. That partly is because the combination of Georgetown’s identity and the location together.”
Georgetown College, the School of Foreign Service and the School of Nursing and Health Studies all saw increased number of applications.
The College had a pool of 12,920 applicants, compared to 11,674 applicants last year with 1,883 applicants for an acceptance rate of 14.6 percent.
The SFS saw 3,994 applications, up from 3,792 last year and accepted 666 applicants at a rate of 16.7 percent.
The NHS had 1,268 applicants, up from 1,227 applicants last year and saw an acceptance rate of 17.8 percent with 226 students accepted.
The McDonough School of Business saw a slight decline in application numbers, with a pool of 3,283 compared to last year’s pool of 3,304. The MSB accepted 538, or 16.4 percent of applicants.
Of the admitted students, 12 percent, or 393, are black, 635 or 19 percent are Asian and 410 or 16 percent identified as Latino. According to Deacon, these numbers have increased steadily with the pool, though the number of accepted students who are Latino increased slightly more from last year’s 11 percent.
The average admitted student ranked in the top 3 percent of their class.
The Class of 2021 accepted students includes a student from all 50 states, with California, New York and New Jersey having the highest number of applicants.
According to Deacon, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions tries to focus on individual students during the application process rather than the numbers of applicants.
“We try to make it student-centered, so we don’t look at driving numbers way up, we look at trying to create an opportunity for you to actually talk to us,” Deacon said. “In many ways, there no place better to be than right here.”
Deacon said before the final pool numbers came in, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions made the decision to increase the size of the incoming class, combined with the number of transfers, from 1,580 to 1,600.
Additionally, Deacon said part of the heightened numbers of applications this year can be attributed to the changes the College Board made to the SAT tests, which included a lowering the maximum score to a 1,600 as opposed to 2,400, combining the critical reading and the writing sections and eliminating the penalty for wrong answers.
Of admitted students, the middle 50 percent scored between 690 and 770 on the writing and language section and between 680 and 770 on the math section. On the ACT, the middle 50 percent scored between 31 and 34.
Deacon said that students taking the new test tended to score higher, which would have encouraged them to apply to top-tier schools like Georgetown.
“This was a redesigned test that sort of made it more like the ACT in the sense that it was more aligned with curricular-type things as opposed to just academic power,” Deacon said. “Our overall SAT averages of the pool increased by 25 points. That would suggest that the people who were getting higher scores decided to apply to tougher colleges.”
Though the Office of Undergraduate Admissions has not collected finalized numbers on first-generation college students, Deacon said around 12 percent of the pool is composed of first-generation students.
Programs like the Georgetown Scholarship Program and the Community Scholars Program, both of which provide financial and support to first-generation students, have strengthened Georgetown’s ability to encourage more applicants, according to Deacon.
“What GSP is all about, what Community Scholars is about, is trying to move beyond the elite schools to schools where students would not necessarily apply to Georgetown, they try to give them some consideration,” Deacon said.
However, Georgetown’s relatively low endowment impedes its ability to support higher numbers of students from low-income backgrounds.
“If we had more money, we would have more first-gen kids, I guarantee you. But we don’t have more money right now,” Deacon said. “Really since the ’80s, we have been competing at the highest level. But it’s hard when everybody else has a lot more money.”
Deacon also predicted changes to the financial aid protocol given President Donald Trump’s and the Republican-controlled Congress’ hints at cutting back on Pell grants and federal work-study programs, which are both income-based financial aid programs.
“I don’t know what is going to happen in this current Congress and administration. They’re talking about cutting Pell grants, and we’re going to have to rethink the way that financial aid is distributed in general,” Deacon said.
Georgetown and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are the two top-tier schools across the country that utilize their own applications as opposed to the Common Application. Deacon did not predict the university will move to the Common Application any time soon.
“We couldn’t accommodate doing the Common Application. It would change everything if we did it and it would probably change, to a degree, the student body we get — not for the better,” Deacon said.
Deacon said that Georgetown’s independent application lends itself to a more committed pool of applicants, which in turn increases the yield.
“It means that there’s some sort of self-selection in our applicant pool, which means that we don’t have those kind of people in the pool who are really good students, but for whom we are just one of many,” Deacon said. “We get people who actually have a good reason to be in our applicant pool.”
For students who end up in Georgetown’s Class of 2021 because they did not get into their first-choice schools, Deacon said students are satisfied with their choice because Georgetown’s external application requires additional work.
“We’re doing things that make you do more, and yet the pool keeps going up. That would suggest that people are willing to do it,” Deacon said. “If they end up here even if we weren’t the first choice, I think they feel like they earned it.”
Admitted students will be invited to attend the Georgetown Admissions Ambassadors Program Open Houses on the weekends of April 7 and April 22. Final enrollment decisions are due by May 1.
Deacon anticipates the yield will remain steady or increase slightly from last year’s 48 percent.

Interesting article. The graphic labeled “Admission Rates,” however, doesn’t show admission rates. It instead shows a breakdown of the admitted class, by ethnicity (not by race – “Latino” is at best an ethnic but not a racial category).
What would be more illuminating to me would be to show actual admission rates by ethnicity – i.e.what percentage of those who applied in each ethnic category, are admitted. That could be an eye-opener, if Georgetown’s admissions policies are at all similar to those of the Ivies, where Asian applicants are admitted at a significantly lower rate than, respectively, Latinos and Blacks.
[…] Georgetown […]
[…] history, with the largest overall application pool and one of the lowest acceptance rates. The 15.4 percent overall acceptance rate into the Class of 2021 was the lowest ever and a full percentage point lower than the previous six […]

The Media Board’s student activities fee funding is set to decrease from $95,000 to $57,500 — a 39.5 percent cut — as approved Sunday in the Georgetown University Student Association Finance and Appropriation Committee fiscal year 2018 budget.
The budget, approved unanimously by the 28-person GUSA senate Sunday, allocates exactly $1,000,640 collected from the annual student activities fee to Georgetown’s advisory boards and other student activities, including the Lecture Fund and Georgetown Program Board.
Most advisory boards received an increase in their appropriations, with the Advisory Board on Club Sports receiving an 8 percent increase from $185,000 to $200,000 and the Campus Ministry Student Forum gaining a 4.9 percent increase from $18,500 to $19,400.
GUSA received $23,950, with a requirement that the GUSA Fund allocation, which provides funding for other student groups, must not exceed $15,000 and that the Transfer Council, which coordinates programming for transfer students, shall receive a $5,000 internal budget allocation.
The overall allocation represents a $2,438 increase from last fiscal year’s $998,202 budget. Advisory boards requested a total of exactly $1,344,242.63.
Members of Fin/App serve as liaisons to the advisory boards in the budget allocation process.
Fin/App Media Board Liaison Alejandro Serrano (MSB ’17) said the Media Board had not shown requisite responsibility for its own expenditures and needs, especially relating to the media outlets that print their publications.
“The consensus was that they were not as fiscally precise as other budget boards. No one has any idea what the percentage of print readership is, and if there’s no justification for printing more — we have a very limited budget,” Serrano said.
Serrano said The Hoya’s decision to become a full-scale online daily and print weekly starting next school year reaffirmed Fin/App’s reasoning for cutting the Media Board budget.
“The moment we found that out was during the appeals meeting, and when they said that, I thought there was no reason, then, to ever increase it. It reinforced our conviction,” Serrano said.
Media Board Chair Paul Henderson (COL ’18), who represents Georgetown University Radio, said Fin/App does not understand the value the Media Board offers the Georgetown community.
“I don’t know whether to call it lack of understanding or lack of concern with the value of media organizations on campus from Fin/App,” Henderson said. “During the whole process, they very much expressed their discontent that Media Board organizations don’t generate a lot of revenue, and it’s true; they don’t.”
Henderson said the budget cut will have a significant impact on the products Media Board groups can offer next year. According to Henderson, WGTB will most likely not be able to host its Fall Concert next semester.
“It will be pretty drastic,” Henderson said. “What this effectively does is freeze Media Board organizations. This will mainly hurt marketing, outreach and events, which are really the three things within a publication that draw new members.”
The Performing Arts Advisory Council received an $82,000 allocation, identical to its allocation from last year. However, the allocation was only 72 percent of the about $113,000 requested.
In Fin/App’s explanation of the budget allocations, PAAC Liaison Senator Josh Sirois (SFS ’20) said PAAC did not receive its full allocation because students should not be paying for capital improvements to university facilities — the portion of the allocation PAAC was denied. Poulton Hall, the home of Mask and Bauble, requires a $100,000 renovation to its floor, according to PAAC Vice Chair Taylor Oster (SFS ’17), PAAC’s representative to Fin/App.
Oster said Fin/App’s funding decision is still concerning regarding the future of performing arts.
“We will be able to ensure the programming performing arts groups put on on campus,” Oster said. “We were flat-out rejected for our capital improvements request, which has not happened in years past, which was a little disconcerting. If the university isn’t fulfilling its obligation to student groups in terms of capital improvements, then someone needs to pick up the bill, and we needed the student activities budget.”
Fin/App declined the Council of Advisory Board’s first budget request in recent memory due to a lack of clarity in the proposal over how CAB would use its funding.
Oster said Fin/App’s rejection of CAB is fair considering the quality of CAB’s funding proposal.
“CAB is a relatively new entity, so it’s still finding where it belongs on campus. We were brainstorming ways to reach out to students, and we realized we can hold these events, we can do programming, but you need funding for that,” Oster said. “Because this is a new concept for how CAB will interact with the student body, we didn’t really have a set game plan, and I understand why Fin/App was hesitant to offer any kind of funding.”
The Georgetown Program Board, which arranges social and leisure events for the student body, received $93,340, just short of its total from fiscal year 2017 of $94,000. GPB saw its budget cut by $12,000 last year, down from $106,000.
GUSA senator Zachary Oschin (SFS ’20), who is the Fin/App liaison to GPB, said the Board was able to reverse a trend of having its budget cut through a well-attended year of programming.
“GPB has been the most cut group in Georgetown history, partially because some of the previous Program Boards had been irresponsible with their money, and mostly because it was an easy thing to pick on,” Oschin said. “To their credit, they had an amazing board this year, put on amazing programming, put on events throughout the year; Mr. Georgetown, the hockey games, the movies — they did really well.”
GPB received an additional $8,340 in the appeals process for its spring concert.
The Georgetown Day tradition returns to the budget for fiscal year 2018 with an allocated $11,500. This April’s Georgetown Day is not financially sponsored by GUSA after the Georgetown Day Planning Committee failed to submit a requested budget to Fin/App last spring.
Serrano said a divide persisted within Fin/App between freshmen and upperclassmen over the importance of Georgetown Day  and how much of the yearly budget should be dedicated toward it.
“As a senior, I won’t see the benefit of increasing funding for Georgetown Day — this is for you guys. We know how special it is,” Serrano said. “It’s the one day where there are no other plans, and the entire student body loves it.”
Full disclosure: The Hoya is a member of Media Board.

Obviously this article would fail to mention that the media board representative LIED to the Senate FinApp committee about the existence of some of their revenue streams. BIASED FAKE NEWS.

A new Metropolitan Police Department initiative to publicize reports of missing black and Latino youth in Washington, D.C., has drawn national attention and public outcry to a perceived increase in missing persons of color.
The Congressional Black Caucus called on the FBI to assist the MPD in investigating cases of missing children March 23, according to the Associated Press.
MPD has reported a total of 861 missing person cases since the start of 2017, prompting Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) to introduce a series of six initiatives to address missing young people in D.C.
However, MPD maintains there is no significant increase in missing young people in the area. Instead, MPD has expanded upon an information sharing technique, which debuted in December 2016. The department has been posting photos and personal information about individuals reported missing on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to recruit public assistance in locating the missing.
The situation of many of those reported has been deemed “critical,” a definition that includes individuals under the age of 15 or over the age of 65, as well as chronic runaways and those who present an imminent danger to themselves or others.
In the past, MPD has used its discretion to distribute photographs and names of some of the missing. Since December, the department has begun posting every missing person’s information.
The technique was announced in a March 16 press conference with Bowser, MPD Commander Chanel Dickerson and interim MPD Chief Peter Newsham, after a post on Twitter and Instagram claiming that 14 young women of color had been reported missing in a 24-hour time span went viral and the hashtag #MissingDCGirls began trending.
At the press conference, Dickerson urged the community to stay calm and explained that the number of missing person cases in D.C. had not increased.
“Let me first reassure you, we have no indication young girls in the District are being preyed upon by human traffickers in large numbers,” Dickerson said. “But when we talk about numbers, I’m not trying to minimize when I say there’s not an uptick or there’s been a decrease. It’s just that we wanted to be transparent.”
Newsham explained that MPD’s social media strategy may have caused confusion and concern among D.C. residents, but is serving its purpose.
Bowser affirmed this, saying that the social media approach has facilitated MPD’s ability to find missing persons.
“What we are seeing is an increase in the amount of attention and awareness that we are putting on children that have been separated from families,” Bowser said at the press conference. “In fact, we think MPD is leading in best practices that other departments should follow.”
Bowser announced March 24 she would establish six new initiatives to help find missing young people. Among these are increasing the number of MPD officers assigned to the Children and Family Services Division, expanding the MPD Missing Persons webpage and creating a public service announcement to support the 1 (800) RUN-AWAY hotline for missing youth.
“Through social media, we have been able to highlight this problem and bring awareness to open cases, and now we are doing more to ensure that families and children are receiving the wraparound services they need to keep families together and children safe,” Bowser said in a March 24 press release.
Various posts on social media have relied on information collected from MPD’s social media posts reporting the disappearance of 22 people, including a dozen black or Latino minors in the span of five days this month. Several tweets that have gone viral have underscored a lack of media attention on the disappearance of people of color when compared to white individuals.
Of the missing youths reported between March 19 and March 24, two remain missing.
Since the start of 2017, MPD has been able to resolve 830 cases, due in part to its social media strategy. Thirty-one missing people cases remain open, 17 of which are juvenile cases, according to MPD data.
The confusion over a perceived uptick in missing children in D.C. provoked public pressure for increased efforts to prevent disappearances and improve MPD resources dedicated to finding missing persons.
According to MPD data, 3,547 missing person cases were recorded in 2016, with 2,443 cases deemed critical. Six missing person cases remain open, with four critical and two non-critical cases.
The MPD has pushed back against press coverage that has suggested there has been an increase in the number of missing person cases in D.C.
Instead, the department reports fewer missing persons cases in 2017 thus far than in years past, about ten fewer per month.
Mindy Good, communications director for the D.C. Child and Family Services Agency, said that most missing person cases do not result from human trafficking, but rather from unstable personal situations.
Good said there must be a conversation around what the causes are and how it can be mitigated.
“These are legitimate issues but not at the rates many people seem to think,” Good wrote in an email to The Hoya. “However, runaways are far more vulnerable to kidnapping or trafficking even if that wasn’t their original situation so all the more reason to identify and address the root causes of what’s troubling these young people.”
Good praised one of Bowser’s initiatives involving members of the CFSA in analyzing open missing person cases.
“While all her six approaches may be helpful, we especially like the approach of seeing running away as a symptom and getting to the root of what’s troubling youth runaways,” Good wrote. “The mayor has set up a task force/work group with our CFSA Director serving as a co-chair.”
MPD Supervisory Public Affairs Specialist Margarita Mikhaylova said the increased publicity surrounding missing young people has helped to bring awareness to the domestic situation causing many young people to run away.
“As we’ve said previously, we are working to increase community awareness surrounding missing people, and missing children,” Mikhaylova wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The complex factors involved with some of the circumstances surrounding young men and women in D.C. and nationwide are ones that deserve in-depth review and discussion.”
Mikhaylova said the decision to release more details about the subjects over social media has been an effective tool in bringing more awareness to missing young people. She asked that community members be aware of their surroundings to help find more missing people.
“The idea behind the aggressive social media push is to increase community awareness of the missing individuals and assist with bringing them home,” Mikhaylova wrote. “We believe it has been successful.”

The Democratic Party must continue outreach efforts to millennials to remain the progressive organization it claims to be, argued Tom Perez and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), the chair and vice chair of the Democratic National Committee on Wednesday.
Perez also addressed growing young immigrant populations around the country and emphasized that the Democratic Party stands with immigrant communities.
“No matter where you were born, no matter what your first language was at home, no matter who you worship, no matter who you love — there is a place for you at the American table, and those are the pillars of the Democratic Party,” Perez said.
Hosted by the McCourt School of Public Policy’s Institute of Politics and Public Service, the former rivals for the DNC chair position analyzed their party’s strategy to engage young voters in the political process and convince millennials their values align with Democrats.
Perez and Ellison were the two front-runners during the nearly four-month race for the DNC’s chairmanship. The election marked the first contested election since 1985.
Perez, the labor secretary under President Barack Obama, received backing from former Vice President Joe Biden and House Minority Whip Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and represented the moderate wing of the party.
Ellison, then a congressman from Minnesota, received support from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), as well as members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.
Perez defeated Ellison in the second round of voting in the Feb. 25 election and motioned for Ellison to be selected as vice chair.
GU Politics Executive Director Mo Elleithee, a former DNC communications director and spokesperson, guided Perez and Ellison’s discussion of what defines the Democratic Party.
Perez said millennials should be drawn to the Democratic Party because it addresses the issues about which they are passionate in a both a comprehensive and compassionate way.
“We have the common man and the common woman in mind — fighting for them, fighting for fairness, fighting to level the playing field,” Perez said.
Ellison said millennials should be able to identify with the party’s economic vision.
“The way that we reach millennials is to recognize that this economy has shifted dramatically. The people in their forties and fifties may remember a time where you can work your way through with a part-time job. You can’t do that no more,” Ellison said.
According to Elleithee, 29 percent of millennials identified with the Democratic Party in 2015, 17 percent identified with the Republican Party and 48 percent identified with neither group.
Elleithee asked Perez and Ellison to consider how the Democratic Party can not only maintain its base, but also attract those who do not identify with either party.
“I was Democrat because my dad was a Democrat. That is not a good enough a reason for the next generation,” Perez said.
Perez added that the generational gap can be bridged through action, which will attract younger voters.
“The good news is that our values are the same,” Perez said. “The challenge for us is to put our values into action.”
Ellison said Democrats must continue to develop an economic message designed for millennials and ensure they are aware the Democratic Party stands for strong economic policy.
Ellison referenced the 2016 presidential election, stating that though the party developed an economic strategy within its platform, it was not effectively communicated to young voters.
“We are very clear that all over the country, the Democratic Party stands for raising the wage, the right to organize in a labor union, to fighting for overtime, to protecting and defending and advancing that. It is not just what we say in terms of message,” Ellison said. “The real problem is not that we didn’t have an economic message, we didn’t articulate it and we didn’t bring it to the people.”

The Legacy of GU 272 Alliance, a group of descendants of the 272 slaves sold to a Louisiana plantation in 1838 whose sale benefited Georgetown, has hired lawyers to facilitate talks with Georgetown as the university looks to reconcile its slaveholding past.
The group, which is made up of about 100 descendants of the 272 slaves, is hoping its attainment of a legal team will help it gain more of a voice in the reconciliation process.
The group is separate from the GU 272 Descendants Association, another group of descendants of the 272 slaves.
Adjoa Aiyetoro, a professor at the University of Little Rock William H. Bowen School of Law and one of the six lawyers working pro bono to aid the Legacy of GU 272 Alliance, said the group’s main goal is to be more involved in the reconciliation process with the university.
“What has happened to date is that Georgetown is making decisions about what to do and they aren’t really reaching out to descendants as a whole to ask what is it you would like us to do,” Aiyetoro said. “In talking with Georgetown, they felt that it was important that they get people who are skilled in negotiations and discussions with institutions such as Georgetown. They felt they would be heard better that way.”
Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh said the university is committed to including descendants in ongoing conversations throughout the reconciliation process.
“Our senior leaders have met with descendants and their representatives who have approached the university and our students, faculty and administrators have traveled to meet descendants where they live. We will continue to seek their input while working to promote racial justice through research and teaching,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We look forward to continued dialogue within our community and across the nation.”
University President John DeGioia announced a series of initiatives to address the university’s connections with slavery in September, including the granting of legacy status to the descendants of the 272 slaves sold by the university to a Louisiana Plantation in 1838 and the establishment of an institute dedicated to scholarship on slavery and its implications in the United States.
The university announced plans March 24 to rename Freedom Hall as Isaac Hawkins Hall, in honor of the first enslaved person recorded in the 1838 sale of the 272 slaves that benefitted Georgetown, and Remembrance Hall as Anne Marie Becraft Hall, in honor of a free women of color and educator in the Georgetown neighborhood during the 19th century, on April 18.
The university originally planned to rename Freedom Hall as Isaac Hall, but agreed to rename it as Isaac Hawkins Hall after discussions with the university, according to Pugh.
The two halls that constitute the Former Jesuit Residence were first renamed from Mulledy Hall and McSherry Hall after a series of student protests and a sit-in in DeGioia’s office in November 2015. Former University President Thomas Mulledy, S.J., authorized the sale of the 272 slaves to a Louisiana plantation, while former University President William McSherry, S.J., served as Mulledy’s lawyer during the sale.
The university also plans to offer an official apology for the university’s relationship with slavery in a spiritual ceremony in partnership with the Archdiocese of Washington and the Society of Jesus on April 18.
According to Aiyetoro, the group feels the university has not done a sufficient job of fulfilling the recommendations put forth by the working group in its report.
“Once they revealed and disclosed these injuries back in 2015, they are continuing to make decisions without full inclusion of descendants,” Aiyetoro said.
History professor Adam Rothman, who was a member of the Working Group on Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation, said the university’s efforts to tell the history of its involvement in slavery could also involve descendants more substantially.
“There’s a lot of room for collaboration on that project between descendants and those who are doing research here at the university. That could be very constructive and very productive,” Rothman said.
Aiyetoro said the Legacy of GU 272 Alliance legal team remains hopeful for more tangible involvement of descendants in university discussions.
“We hope that the university will have a forum on April 18,” Aiyetoro said. “Where descendants can ask specific questions of and make comments to the leadership both of the Jesuits and of Georgetown.”

Wonderful.  They should sue.  It would be a great lesson for all the virtue-signaling liberals out there.  We can pay for any reparations awarded through increased tuition!

“Involve the descendants more substantially”? How? Are we talking about anthropology, history, or more to the point, money? How can people who may be related by maybe 1/20th of a bloodline contribute unless there is some archival information or artifacts to contribute. Maybe there is some family legend based on historical fact that may shed some light on a very dark era? Slavery ended over 150 years ago. If the descendants have a true interest in having the story of their enslaved relatives brought to light then I applaud and would invite participation. It does sound a little like using liberal guilt to get a settlement?

Georgetown want’s to reconcile it’s slave holding past? I kinda get it? Georgetown feels guilty about having slaves and wants to find a way to do a little groveling?Just re naming a building wont cut it? Then we have ancestors who feel the need to hire legal council? Do lawyers ever get involved for altruistic reasons without the expectation of a settlement? Not likely.
There was this little thing called the Civil War that bloodied this nation and ended slavery. Historians argue about it’s causes which were many but slavery was undeniably the underlying root and it’s end was the result!
My immediate ancestors came over from Ireland in the early 20th century to escape British tyranny. The Irish that were here during the war were slaughtered by the thousands mostly for the union! Where are the lawyers for them? Where is there even a little appreciation?

Unemployment rates in Washington, D.C., remained stable at 5.7 percent, according to preliminary data released by the the District Office of Unemployment Services on March 24.
Steadily declining since 2011, the current unemployment rate, which has been the rate since December, marks the lowest unemployment since January of 2008. The rate last February was 6.2 percent.
Though the February unemployment rate itself remained unchanged, the District added 4,400 private sector jobs and lost 1,800 public sector jobs between January and February. However, trade, education, information, financial, manufacturing, professional, construction and leisure sectors all saw job growth.
Together, the trade, information, financial, construction and transportation and utilities sectors saw a collective loss of 2,600 jobs between January and February.
Though this is the lowest unemployment rate in 9 years, the rate is still a full percentage above the national unemployment rate.
District Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) said the rate’s stability demonstrates her continued dedication to getting more D.C. residents back to work.
“My Administration is committed to inclusive prosperity, which means more jobs and economic opportunity for residents in all eight wards,” Bowser wrote in a March 24 press release. “Our economic strategy prioritizes communities often left behind by focusing on ensuring that residents have the skills they need to participate in D.C.’s workforce.”
Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce Senior Research Analyst Andrew Hanson said stagnation in unemployment rates over two months should not raise concern, but this trend can be concerning if it continues for an extended period of time.
“In general, as we look at the longer term unemployment rate and see its direction, if we see that it stays the same for 3 to 6 months in a row, that’s when there should be cause for concern. I don’t think we should be too upset or outraged for the moment,” Hanson said.
Hanson also explained that the unemployment rate in the District is more complicated to analyze than looking at the unemployment rates of other U.S. states or territories due to the significant number of commuters the city employs.
When the District metro area is taken into consideration, the unemployment rate is approximately 3.9 percent. Comparable metros such as Boston, New York City and Atlanta, have unemployment rates of 3.5 percent, 4.6 percent and 5.3 percent, respectively.
“In real economies, people commute across state lines, and for the metropolitan area the unemployment rate is actually substantially lower than the national average. It’s 3.9 percent, and it’s actually one of the better labor markets if you look at the entire metro area,” Hanson said.
Hanson added that the unemployment rate within the District tends to be higher due to the low-income populations living within the city and not in the surrounding metro area.
“What makes it slightly worse in the city as opposed to the entire metro area is that the population is a little bit lower income, is a little bit less educated and has a bit harder time finding work compared to the broader metro area,” Hanson said.
Hanson also suggested that reducing the city’s high transportation costs and providing more low-income housing could also help decrease the unemployment rate in the District.
“If they can’t find an affordable way to get to jobs that are available, oftentimes that’s a huge barrier for them. In terms of housing, finding ways to promote or find affordable housing so that people can move to the more vibrant, enterprising areas of D.C.,” Hanson said. “In other cities, these are initiatives that have been launched on the micro scale across the country.”
Hanson predicts the unemployment rate in D.C. will continue to decline in the near future. However, he believes that the more distant future is uncertain.
“It looks like it will continue to come down, it’s been a pretty continual downward trajectory since 2011, and so you can expect that for the near term. There’s a lot of uncertainty about the long-term of that,” Hanson said. “All of the signs indicate that the labor market is basically at full employment, so eventually it will come to a point where we won’t see much further downward trajectory unless we’re able to find ways to really address the skills gaps in the city.”

Students and administrators launched HoyasforShe, the student advocacy component of the university’s United Nations HeForShe campaign commitment, with plans to coordinate gender equity marketing efforts among clubs in Copley Formal Lounge on Thursday night.
University President John J. DeGioia was named one of 10 IMPACT champions by the UN Women’s HeForShe campaign in 2016, requiring the university to build a grassroots advocacy movement, engage the university community and raise awareness to fight for gender equity.
The movement requires the university to enlist students and other student groups in its gender equity movement.
Students of Georgetown, Inc. hosted HoyasForShe week from Feb. 12 to Feb. 17, where it hosted events and promoted gender equity in its storefronts, as part of a larger push by student groups to push gender equity.
The university also plans to advance of the role of women globally through the Institute for Women Peace and Security Studies and Initiatives and the university’s first Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey completed between Jan. 14 and Feb. 15.
DeGioia said Georgetown’s involvement with HeForShe and UN Women is in line with university values, in particular cura personalis, or care for the whole person.
“The only way we will realize the full development of all of our people is if we empower women for leadership,” DeGioia said in a video statement. “No one will be denied the opportunities that will ensure a full development of all of her capacities.”
According to its mission statement, the HoyasForShe student movement, in support of the UN Women’s HeForShe campaign, aims to create conditions for gender equity and human dignity to flourish on campus and worldwide.
Camille Bangug (SFS ’19), an at-large member of the board, said HoyasForShe emphasizes intersectionality.
“We want to achieve gender equity by recognizing the contributions of all genders, so not just empowering women but empowering people of every single gender identity,” Bangug said. “This meant to us focusing on how we can empower individuals across the gender spectrum, and working with them to create solutions that are inclusive, and to change Georgetown’s gender climate, not just so it serves women but so it serves all of us and the way that we perceive gender to be on our campus.”
According to Bangug, HoyasforShe aims to promote gender equity over equality.
“Achieving gender equity on our campus would mean providing recognition in the differences that make our campus so diverse and then ensuring that everyone has the ability to flourish [as] a member of our community,” Bangug said.
Madison Thomas (COL ’19), at-large member of the HoyasforShe Executive Committee, said engaging a variety of communities on campus is important to achieve the goals of the HoyasforShe movement.
“It’s really important that we remember that this is a really intersectional movement on campus. We need every voice on this campus to be involved,” Thomas said. “It is creating unity to recognize and fight the inequity on this campus. Every community matters in this fight.”
Former Georgetown University Student Association President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said she believes the university is not currently achieving gender equity.
“What I love about the HoyasforShe initiative is that it recognizes that the fight for gender justice and equity is a community effort and not just a fight led by one gender I think as we approach this conversation on gender equity, we need to be mindful of how gender can intersect with identities to just race ethnicity, socio-economic class, ability, sexual orientation and how those intersections can create additional social barriers here on our campus and beyond,” Khan said.
According to Khan, Georgetown should focus on achieving gender equity in social life, academic life and club leadership.
“We need to think about how we can improve our conversations and our learning environments so that it is equally empowering for people of all gender identities. How can we reform our club and social culture so that they are inclusive?” Khan said. “During my time here, I’ve learned that sexism and gender injustice not only exist, but they are very prevalent. I’ve seen firsthand, other women be victims of sexism, objectification, misogyny and disempowerment and sexual violence. This needs to end.”
Khan said the university and student body should commit to developing a gender inclusive community.
“The time has come to mobilize, organize and enact real change in procedures and policy,” Khan said. “Our aim with this initiative should be to ensure that we have a community where all Hoyas, regardless of gender identity, can thrive and feel empowered enough to succeed after graduation.”
Bangug said she hopes the Georgetown community will join HoyasForShe to change the university’s gender climate.
“If you can join us in recognizing, accepting and celebrating those differences so that when we change Georgetown’s gender climate, it’s not just for men and women, it’s for all individuals across the gender spectrum, along with recognizing how our identities interact with those relationships,” Bangug said.

In its inaugural UndocuWeek from April 2 to April 7, student advocacy group UndocuHoyas plans to host various public discussions and film screenings highlighting the experiences of both the on-campus and nationwide undocumented community.
The events are co-sponsored by the Center for Multicultural Equity & Access and Georgetown Scholarship Program, and mark the first anniversary of the Undocumented Student Resources website, launched April 7, 2016.
Undocumented Students Adviser Arelis Palacios said UndocuWeek seeks to educate the community about the strength and courage of undocumented students.
“It’s an educational series designed to raise awareness about these topics to the broader campus community, and also a great opportunity to showcase the successes and resilience of our students and their advocacy,” Palacios wrote in an e-mail to The Hoya.
The week kicks off against the backdrop of President Donald Trump’s White House, which has drawn attention to immigrants without authorization through inflammatory statements and executive policies.
Trump said in his June 15, 2015 campaign launch speech that Mexican immigrants were “rapists,” and he has pledged to build a border wall with Mexico during his administration at the cost of the Mexican government.
Trump’s latest decree is Executive Order 13768, “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,” which blocks so-called “sanctuary cities” that refuse to comply with immigration enforcement measures from receiving federal grants. The order garnered criticism and legal challenges from the city and county of San Francisco and the Massachusetts cities of Chelsea and Lawrence.
Mizraim Belman Guerrero (SFS ’20) said UndocuWeek could serve to dispel stereotypes and misinformation about all immigrants, not just those without documentation.
“We really want to shift that national narrative to show that immigrants are here and undocumented students are here and there is really a lot of misinformation out there,” Belman Guerrero said. “These stories are often very powerful and really get to the heart of why people immigrate. It’s not because people come to the United States and want to take advantage of everything — it is because of hardships people go through that force people to migrate.”
Georgetown University Student Association President Kamar Mack (COL ’19) and Vice President Jessica Andino (COL ’18) said UndocuWeek supports Georgetown’s goals of creating an open and compassionate community.
“Our administration is committed to supporting and standing with our fellow members of the Georgetown community,” Mack and Andino wrote in an email to The Hoya. “UndocuWeek embodies this principle through the inclusive and meaningful dialogues it fosters, and we are excited for its resounding success next week. GUSA is proud to support this initiative and look forward to working with more passionate student groups to advance similar initiatives that enhance the Georgetown experience for students from every walk of life.”
Considering the current national discourse around immigration, Palacios said it is more important than ever to reassure undocumented students that they have a right to an education at Georgetown.
“We believe that it’s important given the current climate of uncertainty for immigrant populations across the U.S.,” Palacios said. “As a Jesuit institution, we believe that all students should have the right towards educational attainment, regardless of immigration status.”
Guerrero said he has mostly encountered positive interactions with members of the Georgetown community.
“I definitely think that, for the most part, everyone that I have come in contact with has been very supportive. The university as a whole is really doing things that other universities aren’t,” Belman Guerrero said.
Andino said her previous experience as the GUSA Undocumented Student Inclusivity Chair taught her the importance of recognizing the often-invisible undocumented population at Georgetown.
“It’s important because undocumented students are a student population that not many people know exist on campus, so it’s a chance for students to learn about a student population that they may not know about,” Andino said in an interview with The Hoya. “Obviously there’s still a lot to do, but it’s a chance for them to have their voices heard.”
Palacios said educators have a special duty to focus on students’ education, not on political discourse.
“As educators, our support of undocumented students is apolitical,” Palacios said. “GU has had policies in place for supporting undocumented students for well over a decade, and we continue to affirm GU as a culturally pluralistic environment where individuals of all backgrounds can thrive and be successful.”
Andino said students who may be less knowledgeable about undocumented students’ issues should bring to the UndocuWeek events an open-minded, respectful attitude that acknowledges all students’ humanity.
“If a student doesn’t know anyone who is undocumented or doesn’t know a lot about the issue, just being open-minded, realizing that these students are their peers and as a result we have to be respectful of one another and learning about the unique challenges that undocumented students face that other students may take for granted,” Andino said. “Listening goes a long way.”

Cosmopolitanism can serve as an agent for peace in an age of conflict, according to Pulitzer Prize-winning author Viet Thanh Nguyen at a talk during an annual symposium hosted by the Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Practice in Gaston Hall on Tuesday.
“There are two Americas. There’s the America of openness, inclusion, and there’s the America of Make America Great Again,” Nguyen said. “No, we’re not winning, because as soon as we make an advance in one direction towards good or inclusion, the other side is getting ready to try to counter that in some way.”
This year’s two-day symposium, “The Global Soul: Imagining the Cosmopolitan,” focused on issues of nationhood, identity and transnationalism among others.
Nguyen said opposition to immigration and refugees is rooted in historical attitudes.
“Now we’re living in an era, of course, where the feeling against immigrants and against refugees has heightened in American society, but it’s not a new sentiment,” Nguyen said. “Racism, xenophobia, the desire to close the door against refugees and immigrants has also been as much a part of American society as has been this idea that immigrants should be welcomed and included here.”
Nguyen said refugees are cosmopolitans of a different kind than most that Americans may encounter.
“If they’re bilingual, if they cross borders, if they survived from one country to the next, they are much more cosmopolitan than your average American, who has never left this country, only speaks one language, and could not survive if you put them into a very difficult situation,” Nguyen said.
Nguyen stressed the importance of confronting America’s negative attitudes toward immigrants, especially those who are writers, students and scholars.
“These two realities of America: the cosmopolitan America that welcomes immigrants and refugees, and the imperial America that bombs these countries from which immigrants and refugees come is the same reality. It’s a difficult reality to confront,” Nguyen said.
Nguyen emphasized the importance of minority writers contributing stories about people and groups whose perspectives might otherwise go unvoiced.
“We are going to be forever fighting this conflict because we are never going to have equal access to storytelling. We are never going to have equality in narratives. People for the majority live in an economy of narrative plenitude, they have thousands of stories about them. So one story more or less doesn’t make any difference,” Nguyen said. “But for us, who are in an economy of narrative scarcity, where there is such few stories, every story counts.”
According to Nguyen, minority writers face pressure from their own communities when writing about underrepresented populations.
“Minority writers often feel tempted to humanize because there is this perception that they are working against stereotypes, working against these inadequate understandings of whatever community they are talking about,” Nguyen said. “They want to foreground something positive about that community, and they’re also worried about their communities response to their work.”

A group of 15 students launched the Asian-Pacific Islander Leadership Forum on March 19 in an effort to provide a unifying space for Asian, Asian-American and Pacific Islander students on campus.
The organization “seeks to create spaces for celebrating, affirming, and mobilizing Asian and Pacific Islander students at Georgetown,” according to the group’s mission statement.
The forum joins the Black Leadership Forum and the Latinx Leadership Forum on campus. All forums function as both advocacy and organizational bodies for student groups representing the interests of black and Latinx students at Georgetown.
The group is not planning to seek formal recognition by Georgetown in order to ensure it can take stands on university policy, according to Zachary Frial (SFS ’18), who is the history and education chair for APILF. The Black Leadership Forum and the Latinx Leadership Forum are also not formally recognized by the university, but work with the Center for Multicultural Equity & Access to organize programming.
Frial, who initially started setting up the forum with the other students four months ago, said the leadership forum follows in the footsteps of the Black Leadership Forum and the Latinx Leadership Forum in looking to bring students of Asian and Pacific Islander descent together.
“Like the Black Leadership Forum and Latinx Leadership Forum, we initially wanted to create a unified and organized space for Asian/Asian-American and Pacific Islander student groups to meet and mobilize,” Frial wrote in an email to The Hoya.
According to APILF Relationship Liaison Gina Kim (SFS ’17), students from Asian and Pacific Islander descent do not have currently have an effective venue to express their political opinions as they relate to their cultural identity.
“Although there is a Political Activism Committee within AASA, as a student organization funded by the university AASA often cannot take clear stands on issues on campus and advocate for student needs in this capacity,” Kim wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The organization hopes to provide a space for people to express their concerns and create real and tangible solutions to those problems.”
Frial said APILF also aims to include students not traditionally represented in student groups like the Asian American Student Association.
“AASA has a history of being East-Asian dominated, so creating a new, separate group had the purpose of moving away from East-Asian centeredness so prevalent in many AAPI circles,” Frial wrote. “AASA, as an ‘Asian-American’ Student Association, also does not directly represent the interests of Pacific Islander students, so we made sure that APILF would center on Pacific Islander identities.”
The AASA did not respond to requests for comment as of 2:30 a.m.
According to Frial, the group originally intended to be a forum of leaders from various Asian-Pacific Islander student groups already in existence, such as the Asian American Student Association, with a similar structure to the Black Leadership Forum and the Latinx Leadership Forum. However, the forum ultimately chose to become a group of individuals, rather than a representative body of student groups.
The group currently consists of a 15-person board to organize the forum, with all meetings open to members of the Georgetown community.
According to Frial, in addition to unifying Asian and Pacific Islander students, the group seeks to connect with other student groups of different racial and ethnic backgrounds.
“A big part of our mission is to also forge connections with other student groups on campus that are not Asian- or Pacific Islander-affiliated. For example, we are currently planning one event on Black-South Asian solidarity at the Black House and another on shared Filipino-Latinx heritage at Casa Latina,” Frial wrote. “We would also like to have a discussion on Pacific Islander identity with Native American students on campus.”
APILF Co-Chair of Advocacy Jasmin Ouseph (SFS ’19) said APILF will learn from other cultural groups on campus how to advocate for important issues within their communities.
“By following the lead of the BLF and LLF, I hope that the APILF can create a more active API community that is aware of the racially triangulated position of Asian Americans in the U.S. and seeks to actually do something about the way we fit into the racial hierarchy in this country and be more effective, accountable allies to the Black and Latinx communities,” Ouseph wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Georgetown University Student Association President Kamar Mack (COL ’19), said APILF will fulfill several important needs of the Georgetown community, including organizing the AAPI Heritage Month.
“We believe this is important, since it is trying to bring awareness to a community that is not spotlighted enough on Georgetown’s campus,” Mack wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Mack said cultural organizations such as APILF, AASA, BLF and LLF are important because they help Georgetown students look outward to the global community.
“As Hoyas, we should be become involved in these organizations or attend their events, so that we can become more knowledgeable on their rich culture and heritage as well as the issues that these communities face at Georgetown and in the US,” Mack wrote. “This is an important step in embracing the global campus that we are.”

Addressing the mental health and wellness of refugees is a critical challenge after resettlement, according to panelists at an event hosted yesterday in Lohrfink Auditorium by the student refugee advocacy group No Lost Generation.
The panel included four professionals in mental health, social work and refugees: Georgetown Institute for the Study of International Migration research professor Elzbieta Gozdziak, clinical social worker Goli Bellinger, the George Washington University art therapy program director Heidi Bardot and GWU medical professor Amir Afkhami.
Gozdziak said for most refugees, the primary requirement for mental wellness is full legal status and decent living conditions.
“Proper immigration status is the best mental health intervention for refugees, or for anyone,” Gzodziak said. “The second would be a job. A good job that provides for self-sufficiency, that kind of stuff. Everything else is secondary or tertiary.”
Afkhami stressed the importance of not overlooking the small number of refugees who have serious pathologies that need attention.
“We shouldn’t pathologize everything, but if something is a pathology, it’s a pathology,” Afkhami said. “Major depressive disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, all of these things can be just as debilitating as the psychotic disorders we typically associate with chronic debilitating effects.”
According to Gozdziak, some of those involved in refugee and immigrant policy, though well-intentioned, succumb to negative and unrealistic stereotypes of the refugees they serve. She recalled one social worker suggesting the Muslim husbands they would work with might beat their wives.
“Before we start talking about helping, we have to examine our own prejudices,” Gozdziak said. “Before we worked with the refugees directly, we had to deal with our workers who haven’t seen a refugee, haven’t pinched a refugee, haven’t been a refugee themselves.”
If there is anything social workers need to know about refugees, according to Bardot, it is that they have all survived by displaying resilience.
“It comes down to one aspect of resiliency that will get you through the traumas of war and makes you that survivor,” Bardot said. “If you label someone with that victim mentality, you take them out of a role of control, it’s inevitable that they become a victim. But if you treat them with respect, and you respect and honor that strength and resiliency, it allows them to enter the world very differently.”
Afkhami said many of the difficulties facing resettled refugees when they come to the United States are not unique to their refugee status, but simply extensions of policy weaknesses that affect marginalized citizens as well.
“You look at Washington, D.C., east of the Anacostia, you have the same access challenges for populations just a few miles away from this auditorium,” Afkhami said. “While we have this global outlook, usually we forget those right in front of us.”
Afkhami said students should advocate for health programs that would help newly settled refugees and lifelong citizens alike.
“It’s very easy to get discouraged in this political environment,” Afkhami said. “But all of you have the power to be advocates, and if there’s one thing you can do it’s really to advocate for increased access, increased funding for mental health care, which is something we desperately need in these times when this is an area that is under assault.”

University Librarian Artemis G. Kirk will retire in October 2017 after almost 16 years at the university, according to a campus-wide email sent by University Provost Robert M. Groves on Wednesday.
“I am grateful for the multitude of ways that Artemis has expanded and deepened the University Library’s engagement with the Georgetown University community,” Groves wrote. “I am grateful for her service to Georgetown and her work over the past sixteen years to advance the University’s prominence in research, teaching and learning.”
Groves will appoint a search committee to lead the search for the next university librarian in the coming weeks, according to the email.
During her time as university librarian, Kirk has undertaken a number of projects and programs to improve the library and its resources and collections. Kirk led the planning and funding of the newly renovated Booth Family Center for Special Collections, home to Georgetown’s rare book and manuscript collections, the Georgetown University Archives and the University Art Collection. Under her leadership, the library raised close to $24 million in the For Generations to Come campaign, which in total raised $1.67 billion for the university’s programs.
Kirk said her favorite endeavors have been those that have expanded the library’s collections and resources.
“I have so many favorite projects. Working with a great library staff; adding new resources – -especially the finest collection in private hands in the world, of rare materials on Wordsworth and his Circle — a gift of Professor Emeritus of English Paul Betz,” Kirk wrote in an email to The Hoya.
According to Groves, Kirk has led Georgetown to become a member of multiple national and international higher education and information associations. Kirk has worked to develop the Lauinger Library in London program, which arranges author events for Georgetown alumni in London, and relationships with the Pontifical Institute libraries in Rome and the proposed Jesuit Liberal Arts College for Hong Kong.
Kirk recalled many fond memories of her time at Georgetown, including her trip to Doha, Qatar, to create a plan for the library at SFS-Q, as well as working with architects to create the library’s Master Space Plan.
“I think one favorite [memory] would be the first-ever ‘Party at Club Lau’ in 2007, which was attended by students, senior leaders, and two Jesuits — Fr. Francis Schemel, Chaplain to the staff, and Fr. Christopher Steck, who brought Jack the Bulldog to the party,” Kirk wrote.
Kirk has not yet made plans for her retirement. She said looks forward to the future progress the library will make.
“No one could ask for a better group of people to work with, and I owe them a great debt of gratitude,” Kirk wrote. “Collaborating with remarkable friends and colleagues at the university makes it difficult for me to relinquish the satisfaction that such work brings, but I hope that my successor in this exciting position will lead the library brilliantly into the next segment of the 21st century.”
