The Georgetown University McDonough School of Business (MSB) jumped up three spots from last year among undergraduate business school rankings on Poets&Quants, an online publication covering business education.
The MSB ranked second, only behind the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, and came in first in alumni experience, fourth in admissions rank and second in career outcomes. The school’s climb in ranking is likely due to robust opportunities for networking and career development. 
Exceptional professors and administrators coupled with an array of career programming provide a sound foundation for student success in the MSB, according to Talia Schatz, assistant dean of the McDonough Undergraduate Career Development Center.
“We’ve made it a priority to be a people-first program where opportunities are tailored to each student and their individual career aspirations,” Schatz wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Every student is encouraged to create an academic experience that is unique to their own interests, and they have an entire school of faculty, staff, and alumni available to support them along the way,” 
The McDonough Undergraduate Career Development Center presents students with a variety of networking opportunities. Students can shadow an alumni through the Host a Hoya program, workshop their career path and conference with undergraduate peer career advisors from a range of industries about resumes and interview advice.  
The MSB supports students in school, the workplace and life, which makes them more successful in general, according to Patricia Grant, senior associate dean of the MSB. 
“Overall, everything we do is underpinned by our commitment to students as people, so we support our community in a holistic way — not just in relation to their academic journey,” Grant wrote in an email to The Hoya. “So, the alumni experience rank is a reflection of the academic and experiential learning our students engage in, the advising and support they receive, and their ability to feel prepared for the world beyond the Hilltop.” 
The MSB career center and alumni network allowed her to successfully find internships and career opportunities, according to Sneha Santosh (MSB ’24).  
“The MSB has had great major programs supported by fantastic professors and faculty for a substantial amount of time,” Santosh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I think now this is translating to the workplace, where alums are finding that the soft skills and technical knowledge they’ve gained in the MSB is directly applicable to their careers after graduation.”
Students in the MSB have access to an arsenal of industry knowledge from professor research to graduate guidance, according to Erin Connery (MSB ’24), who obtained internship opportunities at a healthcare logistics startup and a venture capital firm. 
“I’m always so impressed by my professors’ research and work in their respective fields, and I really enjoy connecting with Georgetown graduates,” Connery wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We have Georgetown graduates in basically every industry within business, and I love hearing about their career paths and experiences on the hilltop.” 
Education is always evolving and Grant anticipates that the MSB will continue to support students to succeed in a changing world. 
“We are constantly updating our curriculum and experiential opportunities, seeking new ways to engage with our alumni, and adding advising and career support,” Grant wrote. “We know that entry into Georgetown means that you will be part of our community for life, and we are here to support you every step of the way.”

Georgetown University will hire an associate director for the Disability Cultural Initiative to increase engagement in disability culture and improve inclusion on campus. 
The Disability Cultural Initiative aims to promote social justice and support disabled community members. The new associate director will help guide the initiative and oversee efforts to create a Disability Cultural Center (DCC), which would organize programming, including educational, social and support initiatives for disabled students and allies who want to get involved. The push for a DCC on campus began in 2015 and was reignited last year. 
A DCC would offer various programs, including social events, inclusion trainings, guest panels, mentoring and office hours in an effort to support the disabled community at Georgetown.
The establishment of a DCC would fundamentally improve the Georgetown experience for current and future disabled students, according to Gwyneth Murphy (SFS ’23), Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Accessibility Coordinator.  
“I’ve been dreaming of a DCC since I was a freshman and encountered my first instance of discrimination as a disabled person,” Murphy said in an interview with The Hoya. “I couldn’t get it out of my mind, because there are so many ways my own life would improve. I would feel accepted and included and heard in ways that I really haven’t felt my whole time at Georgetown.”
The GUSA Accessibility Policy Team, with support from student organizations including the Georgetown Disability Alliance, began formally advocating for a DCC last winter. Since Dec. 2020 the petition for the center has garnered over one thousand signatures, including from alumni, faculty, student organizations and other universities. 
Murphy is optimistic that filling the position would advance progress towards creating a disability cultural center.   
“We want to make sure that the position is filled with someone who’s highly qualified and reflects the diverse student body,” Murphy said. “That is our next main goal, and I think genuinely once the position is filled with someone who can dedicate their time to projects, I imagine that it’s really just going to require finding the right space and making sure that the space is accessible.”
The university’s search for a new associate director is a step in the right direction but is just the beginning of advocacy efforts, according to GUSA Accessibility Policy Team Chair Nesreen Shahrour (NHS ’23).
“I think there’s a lot of ways we can improve accessibility. We should continue moving forward and I’m thankful for this step forward,” Shahrour said in an interview with The Hoya. “This is simply a search for someone. We haven’t started the hiring process, and there are a lot of steps moving forward that we need to work on. But I think I’m very appreciative of this step by the university.”
The Disability Cultural Initiative, along with future plans for a DCC, are examples of Georgetown’s commitment to accessibility and equity, according to a university spokesperson. 
“The goal of the Disability Cultural Initiative is to build the foundation for the eventual establishment of a fully-fledged disability cultural center that will coordinate and integrate the educational, academic, social, and support programming for disabled students, faculty, staff, allies, and people interested in learning more about disability,” the university spokesperson wrote to The Hoya.
The GUSA Accessibility Policy Team received guidance from Georgetown English professor Libbie Rifkin, who was the founding director of the Program in Disability Studies from 2017 to 2020. Rifkin is also a special advisor to the vice president of diversity, equity and inclusion for disability. 
The university’s decision to search for a new associate director marks a fundamental shift in the university’s approach to campus culture, according to Professor Rifkin. 
“This initiative moves beyond the deficit model of disability and beyond strict compliance to celebrate disability as an identity, a dimension of diversity and a cultural community,” Rifkin wrote to The Hoya. “I think the effects of this hire will be felt in all areas of University life, in, and importantly, well beyond the classroom: from admissions to residence life to club culture to employment to technology to the broader culture of belonging.”
According to Murphy, when a DCC becomes a reality, it will be a turning point for disabled members of the Georgetown community.
“I think a DCC is finally going to rightfully put the spotlight on this community and allow them a safe space to be themselves and give them an opportunity to finally have a host for their wants and needs,” Murphy said.

Durriya Meer, a licensed psychologist, is the new director of Counseling and Psychiatric Service (CAPS), Georgetown’s primary mental health agency that helps students overcome difficulties that may interfere with the definition and accomplishment of their educational, personal and career goals.
Meer started her role as CAPS director Jan. 24 following a yearlong search that began in December 2020. The search process focused on finding a candidate whose expertise in the field included work with university age students and who would be interested in enhancing services CAPS offers, according to a university spokesperson. 
According to Kathryn Castle, the assistant vice president for Student Health, Meer’s extensive experience in university counseling centers made her the right candidate for the role. 
“Dr. Durriya Meer is a thoughtful and empathetic clinician who has spent more than 20 years in university counseling centers,” Castle wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Dr. Meer is inclusive and collaborative in her approach which I see as a marvelous fit with Georgetown University’s values.”
Meer said one of her priorities is to connect with students and understand their experiences.
“I want to hear from them what their experience with CAPS has been; through the grapevine I have heard varying opinions,” Meer wrote to The Hoya. “I aspire to be a bridge between the different stakeholders.”
According to Meer, gathering student input and improving channels of communication are key to improving the services that CAPS offers. 
“Without truly hearing what students have to say, I do not believe that there can be positive change,” Meer wrote. “I hope that I can listen to the different stakeholders and carry messages across and between so that there is greater understanding and empathy for the different perspectives.”
Meer specializes in counseling and psychology for college students and has 20 years of experience between her time at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Michigan. She previously served as the associate director for the doctoral psychology internship and as a staff psychologist at Johns Hopkins University.
Meer will focus on making all students aware of the scope of CAPS services, according to Castle. 
“Dr. Meer will spend more time in the Georgetown University community educating about the services offered at CAPS and listening to the mental health needs of students,” Castle wrote. “She will think creatively about the provision of mental health care on campus to expand the reach of CAPS across all campuses.”
The university also hired six new clinicians across all CAPS sites to provide direct services to students, according to the university spokesperson. 
“These new hires have a wide range of clinical expertise, some of which include trauma work, group work, mindfulness and meditation and identity work,” the spokesperson wrote. “They also have extensive experience working with BIPOC communities, international students, immigrant populations, refugees, asylum seekers and sexual assault survivors.”
CAPS announced their spring 2022 counseling groups Jan. 27, including groups for understanding self and others, LGBTQ support, international students, Black Indigenous People of Color, interpersonal mindfulness, coping with loss and trauma recovery.   
According to the spokesperson, CAPS services will continue to be provided free of charge this semester, and the university will hire clinical staff as student need arises.
As demand for counseling services rises, Meer commits to maintaining high standards of care for members of the Georgetown community. 
“University counseling centers across the nation are seeing unprecedented demand and strained resources, yet I have seen therapists go above and beyond,” Meer wrote. “It is not just the 45-50 minutes that we spend face-to-face with the student, it is everything that goes on behind the scenes as well—the phone calls, the meetings, the check-ins, the consultations.”

Dr. Durriya A. Meer says

CW: This article discusses gun violence. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
Following a fatal shooting just blocks from Georgetown University’s main campus, students say the Georgetown University Police Department (GUPD) failed to notify the community of the threat in a timely manner.
The shooting occurred at approximately 6:13 p.m. at the intersection of M St. and 33rd St. N.W., near Georgetown Cupcake. When police officers arrived at the scene, the victim was reported unconscious but breathing. 
The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) tweeted about the shooting at 6:40 p.m. The Hoya tweeted about the shooting at 6:53 p.m.
GUPD sent a HOYAlert — a message sent to the Georgetown community with guidance in the event of a threat — at 7:10 p.m, nearly one hour after the perpetrator shot the victim. 
“There is a report of a shooting at 33 St and M St; avoid the area and follow instructions from authorities,” the HOYAlert reads. 
Students expressed concerns for their safety as a result of the delayed notification. 
Carly Comparato (COL ’22) was walking on M St. with two friends when the shooting took place. She hid in CB2, a nearby furniture store, until she thought it was safe to return to her house in the Georgetown neighborhood. 
Comparato said her friend called GUPD at 6:42 p.m. and asked them to send out a HOYAlert. According to Comparato, GUPD told them the HOYAlert was coming shortly; 30 minutes later, the HOYAlert arrived on community members’ phones.
“In my opinion, emergency messages of this kind should be as close to instantaneous as possible,” Comparato wrote to The Hoya. “If it is time consuming to write the message or send it out, that is a safety problem.”
Mike Brodo (SFS ’22), who initially received word of the shooting through a text from a friend,  said he also called GUPD to alert them of the news in hopes of compelling them to send out a HOYAlert.
“I decided to call GUPD and inquire, ‘Is there a plan to send something out? People are concerned, since there’s an active situation, especially with the helicopter with a spotlight,’” Brodo said in an interview with The Hoya. “I called at 6:53, and usually they pick up pretty fast. But it just kept ringing for at least 35, 45 seconds.”
Brennan George (SFS ’23), a resident assistant in Loyola, Xavier and Ryder Hall (LXR), said he took it upon himself to notify his residents at 6:37 p.m. of the potential safety concern after he saw police officers scanning the yards in between houses near campus and heard from people who were returning from the scene that someone had allegedly been shot.
“I hadn’t seen an alert from the university yet, so I thought it was important to notify them in case the suspect was still in the area,” George wrote to The Hoya. “At that point, the details of the shooting hadn’t fully emerged, so for all I knew it could have been a random shooting. For that reason, I wanted to make sure residents knew to take steps to ensure their own safety.”
According to Phoebe Chambers (COL ’25), who found out about the incident via the “Free Food On Campus” GroupMe, a mobile group messaging chat, students were relying on word of mouth from one another for information.
“It’s really disturbing that Georgetown students have to rely on each other to communicate information regarding threats to student safety, but since the University never sends time-sensitive information out quickly, we don’t have a choice,” Chambers wrote to The Hoya. 
Comparato, who lives in an off-campus house only blocks away from the site of the incident, said she and her housemates were uncertain about the proper safety precautions to take without clear guidance from the university.
“The uncertainty and lack of information made us, especially those of us in my house who had just seen the situation firsthand, want to take all possible precautions to stay safe,” Comparato wrote. 
Last semester, students expressed concerns that GUPD failed to notify the campus community of multiple dormitory intrusions, including a Sept. 19 intrusion in which an unknown perpetrator with a pocketknife entered a women’s bathroom in New South Hall and followed a resident through the hallway. 
GUPD sent a HOYAlert as it found out about the public safety concern, according to a university spokesperson. 
“Upon the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) making the Georgetown University Police Department (GUPD) aware of the incident on Monday night, a HOYAlert was sent advising students to avoid the area,” the university spokesperson wrote to The Hoya. 
Brodo said he was concerned about the lack of information in the HOYAlert message that was eventually sent out about 55 minutes after the shooting.
“It was just very plain and lacking substance,” Brodo said. “Based on even what was sent out 30 minutes before that by the D.C. Police, they were providing a little bit more info, they provided a preliminary description of the suspected perpetrator. I felt that maybe Georgetown should have done that.”
Jay Gruber, GUPD chief of police, sent an email to members of the Georgetown community the following morning with an update on the shooting and safety reminders.
Georgetown will increase security around campus in response to the incident, according to a university spokesperson.
“When there is an increase in safety incidents anywhere on campus, GUPD increases patrols out of an abundance of caution and takes appropriate steps to respond to ensure the safety of the community,” the spokesperson wrote. 
The lack of communication surrounding this incident raises additional concerns about community safety in the event of an active shooting situation, according to Brodo.
“I think what it does show is that they’re unprepared for some of the worst situations,” Brodo said. “It does strike a question to me of what if this were a shooting on campus, like an active shooting situation, where it was not a targeted incident? What if it was someone that wanted to engage in a mass shooting, would the response be this pathetic?”

Washington, D.C., will open eight COVID Centers located in each of the eight wards to serve as hubs for District residents to get tested, vaccinated and boosted. 
Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) announced the establishment of the COVID Centers on Jan. 18 as the District experiences a surge of COVID-19 cases due to the highly transmissible omicron variant. The Centers will provide residents with free COVID-19 vaccinations, PCR tests, at-home testing kits and KN95 masks. 
The Centers will serve as a source of stability to District residents who have had to deal with ongoing changes in the locations of testing and vaccination sites since the start of the pandemic, according to Bowser. 
“We said from the beginning if you need a test, you can get a test and we are going to be having centers like this across the district that will make sure that residents know exactly where they can go in their communities, to a more permanent facility that is going to be supported by D.C. Health,” Bowser said at a Jan. 18 press conference.
The increased accessibility to testing and vaccinations that the new COVID Centers provide will foster community safety and health in the District, according to Erik Salmi, communications director for D.C. Councilmember Charles Allen of Ward 6.
“The COVID Centers are fantastic,” Salmi wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It’s important to create places where people can go and simply get any need met as it relates to this pandemic. Vaccines? Check. Masks? Check. Tests? Check. The fewer steps we ask residents to make to keep safe, the more successful we can be as a community.”
Access to rapid tests is essential for children under the age of five who are not yet eligible for vaccination, according to Kelly Whittier, communications director for Councilmember Mary Cheh of Ward 3.
“It’s important for all families to have access to these rapid tests, so they can keenly check to make sure that when they send their children to school they’re sending them to a safe environment and so that their child isn’t putting others at risk,” Whittier said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Seven of the eight wards have successfully opened their respective COVID Centers as of Feb. 2, with the city planning to wrap up lease negotiations to open the Ward 3 COVID Center on Friday, according to Whittier. 
Testing will continue to play a vital role in keeping District schools open for its youngest students, Whitter added. 
“They’ve gotten really great feedback,” Whittier said. “It’s great because you can come in, say you wanted to get a booster, and you could leave with multiple testing kits and masks. If you came in with a partner or family member or friend, essentially whatever your need is can be met right in the community, and so that level of accessibility is super important.”
Providing indispensable resources to the local communities, the COVID Centers are the newest installment in the District’s plan to fight COVID-19, according to Whitter. The centralized nature of the sites’ locations make them valuable tools for combating rising positivity rates, Whitter said.
Although the changing nature of the virus and the spread of new variants will continue to be an ongoing concern, the new COVID Centers are prepared to adapt and adjust, according to Salmi.
“We don’t know what the future will look like with this virus,” Salmi wrote. “We have no idea if we’ll need additional boosters, different tests. But having the infrastructure to be able to respond quickly as we need to is really important.”

In collaboration with four collegiate bipartisan organizations, the Georgetown Bipartisan Coalition (GBC) published a statement on bipartisanship in the United States. 
The statement, published Jan. 27, features the conversations students had at the first annual Collegiate Bipartisan Discourse Summit, which was hosted on Zoom by the GBC in November 2021. The summit included Harvard Undergraduates for Bipartisan Solutions, George Washington Bipartisan Women’s Supper Club (GWBWSC), Dartmouth Political Union and Left, Middle, Right, a national bipartisan student media group.
Compassion is at the core of bipartisan discourse, according to the statement. 
“In order to create this bipartisan space, we are committed to empathy and community, incorporating not only respect for each other as people, but also respect for each other’s arguments themselves,” the statement reads. 
One year after the Jan. 6 Capitol Hill insurrection, Americans are more likely to say political violence is justified, and 34% of Americans say violent action against the government is sometimes justifiable.  
The groups involved hope the statement addresses rising polarization and improves the culture of bipartisan relations, according to GBC President Matteo Caulfield (COL ’23). 
“We’re trying to create a culture where we can bring people from across the political spectrum together to interact with each other in order to create a culture where we can decrease political violence, increase political cooperation and create better policy,” Caulfield said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Political division and violence in the U.S. are serious issues the organizations hoped to address at the summit, according to Luke Henkel (COL ’23), GBC Director of Off-Campus Affairs. 
“The opportunity to get people together who have differing political beliefs and just be able to talk to one another and see each other as human beings is an enormously positive step in the right direction,” Henkel said. “That’s something that we were able to do at the conference and that’s something that we all committed to as organizations.” 
Planning for the summit began in the summer of 2021, Henkel said. 
“A few of us at the Georgetown Bipartisan Coalition got the idea that we wanted to convene some similar organizations together to talk strategy and discuss areas in which we could improve the state of bipartisan discourse on college campuses and in the country more broadly,” Henkel said. “That was the mission we had going in.”
It is important for students from different universities to speak about politics, according to GWBWSC’S Right Wing Co-Chair AJ Manandic, who attended the summit. 
“We all have our own different political environments in D.C. — GW is probably different to Georgetown and Georgetown is probably different to GW,” Manandic said in an interview with The Hoya. “I think it’s really important for us to get a gauge of other people’s universities.”
GBC invited Brian Stelter, CNN’s chief media correspondent and one of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service fall 2021 fellows, to speak at the summit, according to GBC Director of Communications Courtenay Kim-White (COL ’24)
“We were very, very lucky and very blessed to have CNN’s Brian Stelter come speak about the nature of bipartisanship and partisan division in the media and he was fantastic and I think that everyone really took a lot away from what he had to say,” Kim-White said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Kim-White said the summit and statement establish channels of communication the groups hope will translate to the future political landscape. 
“At the schools that we’re bringing together through the Bipartisan Summit, we are bringing together the future leaders of this country. Maybe not all of them are going to be in government, but a lot of them are going to be in politics,” Kim-White said in an interview with The Hoya.
Caulfield said the GBC hopes to make the summit an annual event. 
“This is the first summit ever that we know of for bipartisan-oriented student organizations, and we want Georgetown to be the face of that,” Caulfield said. “We want to be able to host a bipartisan-oriented conference every year.”
GBC hopes to include more schools in the future, according to Henkel. 
“We only had five organizations attend this event, but we’re really proud of that and we think that’s a great start,” Henkel said. “We’re looking to make progress on this in the future and to continue advocating for these goals and supporting the ideals that are so central to our mission as an organization at the Georgetown Bipartisan Coalition.

A $200,000 donation to the McCourt School of Public Policy’s scholarship program will help expand the program to support nine military-connected students.
Craig Newmark Philanthropies (CNP), a non-profit that works to advance grassroot organizations, donated the funds in January 2022. Craig Newmark founded CNP, as well as Craigslist, and is an inaugural member of the McCourt School Advisory Board. CNP established the school’s Craig Newmark Veterans Scholarship Fund in April 2021 through donations. The program will support five additional students with $20,000 scholarships in masters programs in international development policy, policy management, public policy and data science for public policy.
The donation will help McCourt recruit more military-connected students and students who are currently serving on active duty, according to Maria Cancian, dean of the McCourt School.
“This funding will expand the Craig Newmark Veterans Scholarship Fund this year to include five additional student scholarships, enabling us to recruit and support more veterans and military-connected students at McCourt, where they contribute to the diversity of experience and perspectives that enrich our community,” Cancian wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In 2021, there were around 19 million veterans in the United States, less than 10% of the total U.S. population, according to the Department of Veteran Affairs. In 2017, 9% of student veterans were enrolled in graduate programs. 
The scholarship helps cover costs of the program that would otherwise make it impossible to participate in other unpaid opportunities, according to Shyla Alam (GRD ’22), one of the four 2021-2022 Newmark scholars.
“This scholarship has given me the option to pursue work that aligns more with my interests in public service despite many of these positions being unpaid,” Alam wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Without this scholarship, it would be difficult for me to easily accept unpaid opportunities or volunteer in my free time.”
Alam enlisted in the Minnesota National Guard for six years as an intelligence analyst. She was deployed in 2018 to Kuwait in her intelligence role.
The Newmark scholarship has helped close gaps that have made pursuing education after deployment difficult for some veterans, according to Samuel Grantz (GRD ’23), a 2021-2022 Newmark scholar.
“I became involved in the Newmark Scholars program when my GI bill was insufficient to cover school costs,” Grantz wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As a reservist, my GI Bill benefits are significantly smaller than those who served on active duty for their entire time of service. Even if they never deploy, my combat deployment as a reservist does not make up for that gap.” 
Established in 1944, the GI Bill benefits help veterans pay for graduate school, college,and training programs. 
Grantz was in the Marine Corps Reserve Infantry for seven years and served in Afghanistan from October 2017 to April 2018. 
Differences in financial support among certain groups of veterans has made it difficult to further education as well, according to Grantz.
“Active Duty personnel receive 100% of the limit and then are also given access to the ‘Yellow Ribbon Program’ which provides assistance in closing the gap at private institutions whose cost may be higher than the cap for the GI Bill,” Grantz wrote. “Essentially, despite my combat deployment, I was not given a full GI Bill nor do I have access to the Yellow Ribbon Program. Therefore I was in dire need of financial assistance, and this is the major motivating force for getting involved with the Newmark Scholarship.” 
The Yellow Ribbon Program helps veterans to pay for higher private, out of state, foriegn or graduate school tuition fees.
This program will expand support to more veterans in their studies and other opportunities, according to Alam. 
“I’m glad that the program has expanded to offer more military-connected McCourt students the chance to pursue different opportunities they may not otherwise be able to, which will help scholars become better policymakers and leaders in the future,” Alam wrote.

The Georgetown University Technology and Society Initiative, which supports the intersection of government, ethics and technology, received a $10.5 million gift from a graduate and her husband.
The donation will allocate $5 million to the establishment of a technology, ethics and society chair in the College, $5 million to an endowed scholarship fund in the College to provide financial aid and support student research, and $500,000 to support Georgetown’s Ethics Lab to create undergraduate courses focused on technology, ethics and society (TES). 
The gift will provide opportunities for students who wish to study computer science (CS) and TES, according to Mark Maloof, a professor in Georgetown’s computer science department.
“I am most excited about how the gift will impact undergraduate education at Georgetown,” Maloof wrote to The Hoya. “We are in the process of launching a new CS major that integrates CS with applied ethics and policy. The gift will endow a chair in the College who will be a prominent scholar in technology, ethics, and society (TES). The recipient will offer undergraduate courses for this new major.”
The donation will help to expand courses offered at the Ethics Lab, according to Maloof.
“The Ethics Lab will also use funds from the gift to create undergraduate courses on tech, ethics, and society, which also will support the new major and two additional undergraduate programs, a minor in TES and a TES concentration for CS majors,” Maloof wrote.
Due to the gift the Ethics Lab will be able to offer new pilot courses and integrate ethics and computer science courses together, according to Margaret Little, philosophy professor and director of the Ethics Lab.
“With the support of this gift, Ethics Lab has been able to serve as a design platform — mounting pilot courses, bringing together faculty and students in design sessions, and developing new models for integrating ethics into computer science courses — for the new suite of undergraduate programs in Tech, Ethics, & Society that will launch this fall,” Little wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Applicants for the courses that are yet to be created were encouraged to apply to three new tenure positions in early 2022: two endowed professorships and one assistant professor appointment. Each would have a research appointment position in the Center for Digital Ethics, a graduate research unit launched in late 2021 that fosters collaboration between humanities and data science researchers.
The lab is excited to be recruiting for the new chair position, according to Little.
“We are actively recruiting now for the new Chair and Director in Tech, Ethics, & Society,” Little wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The candidates are extraordinary, drawn to Georgetown’s vision.” 
Maloof said that the most significant integration related to technology and society in past classes was in his course titled “Artificial Intelligence,” which he taught in the fall of 2019.
“With funding from the Mozilla Foundation, I worked with a team from the Ethics lab to develop three in-class activities designed to help students understand the ethical implications of AI technologies,” Maloof wrote. “In one exercise students designed a hypothetical system that used machine learning to make admissions decisions at Georgetown. They thought critically about how such a system might exhibit bias in its decisions.” 
The Mozilla Foundation is a nonprofit that works to keep the internet a public resource accessible to everyone.  
The donation will help to support students, faculty, and curriculum related to the technology and science initiative student, faculty and curriculum needs, according to Maloof.

A course offered in fall 2021, titled “How To End A Pandemic,” highlights the impact individuals from various sectors had on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.   
Rebecca Katz, a professor at the Georgetown University Medical Center and the Walsh School of Foreign Service, covered the role of individuals from communities students may not expect to have a role in pandemic responses. Katz teaches courses on global health security, health diplomacy and emerging infectious disease and serves as the Director of the Georgetown University Center for Global Health Science and Security. 
The course was offered to undergraduate and graduate students. 
It is critical to emphasize the unrecognized heroes, including local politicians, journalists and CEOs, who helped slow the spread of COVID-19, according to a press release on the course. 
“There’s this narrative that there are a handful of heroes or heroines in the story of this pandemic — I want to challenge that,” Katz said in the press release. “In actuality, there are tens of thousands of people from all over the world, from all walks of life, who all play a role. So why wouldn’t we highlight the experiences of people from a variety of communities and industries?”
Katz said the course featured speakers from different sectors to share their roles in the pandemic response.  
“There were three parts to the course,” Katz wrote to The Hoya. “Guest speakers from different disciplines speaking about what they have done to ‘end the pandemic,’ a group project to propose to the President’s office how Georgetown could memorialize those from our community who we have lost to COVID-19, and a reflection by students on what they were going to do during the next pandemic.”
Guests invited to speak to the class include Matt Maddox, CEO of Wynn Resorts, a hotel chain; former Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan; Ed Young, a science journalist for the Atlantic; Maria Van Kerkhove, PhD, the COVID-19 technical lead for the World Health Organization; and Joneigh Khaldun, the vice president and chief health equity officer of CVS Health, according to the press release. 
All interviews with guests were recorded and posted to the Georgetown University Center for Global Health Science and Security website in a new project called “How To End a Pandemic: Oral Histories.” 
Sara Gómez Trillos (GRD ’21), who also participated in the course, said the speakers opened her eyes to the ability all individuals have to become leaders during a global health crisis.
“Something that all of the speakers had in common was that none of them had planned to become leaders in pandemic response,” Gómez Trillos wrote to The Hoya. “Rather, they found themselves in a position where something was needed and they saw an opportunity to bridge the gap by either applying their skills or using their positions of power to make informed public health decisions that would benefit the country and world.” 
The course is relevant to all students regardless of their studies or if they are graduate or undergraduate students, according to Trillos. 
Lucien Carbonneau (COL ’22), who participated in this class, said the course allowed students to learn about the behind the scenes research that went into the pandemic response. 
“While we have all been inundated with various information regarding the novel coronavirus and its spread over the past two years many of us have not had the opportunity to hear directly from the people charged with researching the virus, communicating the findings, and designing policies to alleviate its impact,” Carbonneau wrote to The Hoya. 
The course enabled students to understand how they can best apply their skills, according to Trillos. 
“I thoroughly enjoyed listening to all of the stories that speakers had to share with us. I was surprised that I could relate to all of them in one way or another and felt inspired by their achievements,” Trillos wrote, “This, to me, reinforced a deep conviction to always use my skills and power for the public good – and, in my case, to improve health.”

Georgetown Main Street has relaunched its Take Out Tuesday campaign for the second consecutive year. 
The 10-week campaign, organized by Georgetown Main Street, promotes small business on Wisconsin Avenue in the Georgetown neighborhood. The return of this campaign comes as restaurants in Washington D.C. have seen a decline in sales because of the surge of COVID-19 cases caused by the highly transmissible Omicron variant. The event kicked off Jan. 25 and highlights two local restaurants each Tuesday, which are asked to offer promotions for takeout orders, such as discounted prices or a free add-on.  
Georgetown Main Street decided to relaunch Take Out Tuesday due to the impact COVID-19 has had on restaurants, according to Rachel Shank, Executive Director of Georgetown Main Street. 
“We weren’t thinking that we were going to bring it back this year because things seemed like they were slowing down — we didn’t build it into the budget, and then Omicron hit and we realized that this winter may be just as difficult as last winter was,” Shank said in an interview. “So we decided to not break something or remake something that wasn’t broken, and so we brought it back.” 
The surge of COVID-19 cases has financially impacted many small businesses, with 58% of restaurants reporting a loss in more than half of sales this past December, according to a survey conducted by the Independent Restaurant Coalition. 
The campaign has been successful so far in increasing traffic to featured restaurants, according to Shank. 
Take Out Tuesday was created through a collaboration in early 2021 between Georgetown Main Street and Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E (ANC2E) commissioner Elizabeth Miller, according to Shank. who was working alongside Main Street America, a nonprofit that works to revitalize historic districts in the United States, according to Shank. 
Miller, who worked alongside Main Street America, a nonprofit that works to revitalize historic districts in the United States, said it was important that local residents joined together to provide support to small businesses.
“Georgetown is a special place,” Miller wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our community looks out for one another and our community includes the full-time residents, the students, the shops, the restaurants, and everybody in between. When we found out our restaurants needed our help, our village mobilized to support them.”
Last year the campaign received national recognition and earned third place in the American Express Shop Small Order In, Help Out Innovation Challenge run by Main Street America. 
Juan Dromgoole, Director of Operations for Chaia Tacos, a popular vegan taco restaurant in the Georgetown neighborhood, said the rise in COVID-19 cases resulted in reduced sales in the restaurant during December. 
“We definitely saw a huge decrease in sales around mid-December,” Dromgoole wrote in an email to The Hoya. “People were simply not eating out, and, if they did, it was just to pick up an order. No one was eating indoors.”
Chaia was one of the two restaurants featured in the first week of this year’s Take Out Tuesday campaign and saw increased sales as a result, according to Dromgoole.
“So much busier than a regular Tuesday,” Dromgoole wrote. “Tuesdays are usually a pretty chill day, but not yesterday! We had pretty busy lunch and dinner rushes. So grateful for everyone’s business!” 
Peacock Cafe, another restaurant in the Georgetown neighborhood, was also featured in the first week. 
Shank said local businesses are facing even more challenges this winter than they did last year. 
“The numbers are pretty startling, just like they were last year, only the restaurants are struggling with a little bit more than they were last year even,” Shank said. “So there’s the staffing shortages, and then there’s the supply shortages, it’s kind of everything is compounding on itself. We just needed to remind the community that these businesses are only going to exist if we support them.”
Georgetown Main Street incentivizes customers to make takeout sales through discounts offered by each business as well as ordering through an online form that enters them in a giveaway for a $50 gift card, according to Shank. This form also allows Georgetown Main Street to track the increase in orders due to the Take Out Tuesday campaign, Shank said.
Take Out Tuesday builds the community between businesses and residents of the Georgetown neighborhood, according to Dromgoole. 
“We are able to support each other, lift each other and be each other’s fans,” Dromgoole wrote. “It is incredible what you can accomplish when you have such a great sense of community amongst businesses. What makes Georgetown unique, in my opinion, is having such a great combination of people visiting at all times.”

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded Georgetown University a grant that will launch an interdisciplinary training program for biomedical science graduate students Feb. 1. 
The program, titled the Georgetown University Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (IMSD), is a five-year program that combines coursework, thesis research labs and cross-disciplinary mentorship in an effort to expand enrollment of individuals from racial and ethnic groups that are nationally underrepresented in the health sciences. 
The training grant will enroll 20 students in total, with recruitment beginning this month and the incoming cohort beginning in July. The IMSD principal investigators and co-directors are Kathleen Maguire-Zeiss, Caleb McKinney and Ronda Rolfes.
The program will provide the space for biomedical science students to connect with individuals inside and outside of their specific program, according to Rolfes, professor and director of graduate studies in the biology department at Georgetown.
“Students selected for this training grant will become part of a supported cohort that extends beyond the department or program that they join,” Rolfes wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In other words, they will form connections to other students and faculty outside of their own PhD program. The interdisciplinary community is a unique aspect of this training grant relative to the other existing training grants.”
Students are eligible to apply for the program if they are enrolled in one of seven participating Georgetown doctoral programs: biochemistry and molecular biology, biology, chemistry, pharmacology and physiology, neuroscience, physics, and tumor biology. 
Maguire-Zeiss, McKinney and Rolfes submitted their training program proposal to the NIH during winter 2021. 
The idea for the IMSD stemmed from the professors who envisioned an opportunity to create a network between their departments, graduate programs and student development initiatives from the main campus and the biomedical graduate education programs, according to McKinney, assistant dean of graduate and postdoctoral training and development at Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC).
The ability to interact professionally with programs not within a student’s discipline will allow doctoral students to think of biomedical sciences in broader ways, according to McKinney.
“Another hallmark of the program is the professional development component,” McKinney wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We want our trainees to develop the career self-efficacy needed to pursue the scientific career of their choosing down the line after graduation. Therefore we will be providing them with interprofessional experiences such as project management training, and an opportunity to conduct an internship in an area outside of their research project.”
GUMC looks forward to training people who are underrepresented in medicine through this program, according to Edward B. Healton, executive vice president for health sciences at GUMC and executive dean of the School of Medicine.
“We are especially pleased to have the support of this NIH grant in recognition of the work we have planned for building a more inclusive environment across the university, thus allowing us to better train an array of talented individuals who are underrepresented in these critically important fields,” Healton wrote in a GUMC news release.
The first year of the program will consist of coursework in the student’s discipline, with the opportunity for interdepartmental electives. During the second year, students will join cross-disciplinary mentorship teams and thesis research laboratories to allow students to pursue their professional goals related to their individual discipline while also broadening their scientific skills across programs.
By combining departments, the program will also support students in their holistic learning, according to Maguire-Zeiss, chair of the Georgetown neuroscience department.
“It’s a unique program because it brings together faculty from 7 different departments/PhD programs and will provide an array of professional training opportunities for individuals underrepresented in the biomedical sciences,” Maguire-Zeiss wrote in an email to The Hoya. “For me, this program is representative of the way that Georgetown’s research mentors strive to support the whole student — in the classroom, in research, and in personal development.”
The opportunity for different Georgetown campuses to interact among a cohort of students in the biomedical sciences is a distinctive feature of this program, according to McKinney.
“The IMSD funding opportunity really gave us a chance to come together as a campus around this key area, take an inventory of our collective strengths in training, and break down silos so that we could take a unified approach toward recruiting excellent students from diverse backgrounds and providing them with a unique interdisciplinary and interprofessional training experience that incorporates strong mentorship and cohort development components,” McKinney wrote.
