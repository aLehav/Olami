The Teaching, Learning and Technologies Initiative has allowed a group of faculty to reinvigorate their classroom experiences with new teaching techniques this academic year.
The enterprise, which was launched in May 2011 by the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship and the Gelardin New Media Center, aims to help faculty use technology in creative ways to advance learning as well as student- faculty interaction.
According to Executive Director of CNDLS Randall Bass, the university plans to mesh the goals and resources of the program with those of the Doyle Initiative, which focuses on emphasizing diversity and tolerance in the undergraduate curriculum, and the BottleNecks and Threshold Initiative, which is designed to further students’ understanding through engaged writing.
“TLT will continue to push the envelope on technology-enhanced pedagogies,” Bass wrote in an email.
This year, the TLT Initiative includes six faculty fellows from all four of Georgetown’s undergraduate schools.
Professor Betsy Sigman, who teaches in the McDonough School of Business, has applied the program’s technology within her operations and information management courses by having students create online timelines charting companies’ progress and using Google Plus as a classroom forum.
“Being a TLT fellow has almost taken [teaching] to a new level, in that [it has] allowed me to step back and integrate new technology into the classroom and think about new technology I wanted to introduce students to,” Sigman said.
Professor Nancy Crego, who teaches pediatric nursing in the School of Nursing and Health Studies, has used the fellowship to improve her longstanding program of patient simulation by electronically tracking and recording her students’ progress.
Both Sigman and Crego emphasized the initiative’s upside for both students and faculty.
“[Students’] enthusiasm and interest takes things to a new level,” Sigman said. “It creates a community of learning that we all strive for.”
For Crego, the main benefits of being a TLT fellow were unexpected.
“The most positive thing for me on the faculty end is the contact I’ve had with so many different places within Georgetown,” she said. “I found out about other resources, and [my TLT team] shared with me other people on faculty who use technology in different ways. It’s been great networking.”

The Georgetown Conversation, one of the winners of a 2011 ReImagine Georgetown grant, plans to kick off its online lecture series this summer.
The videos will cover a diverse range of topics and are intended to foster dialogue between students, faculty and staff members.
Emily Oehlsen (SFS ’13) and Sam Schneider (COL ’13), a member of THE HOYA’S board of directors, developed the idea for the online forum after being introduced to one another by Georgetown University Student Association President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12). After receiving guidance from Meaney, Oehlsen and Schneider applied for the ReImagine Georgetown grant as a pair.
According to Schneider, the $7,000 received from RIG has been integral to making the concept a reality. He and Oehlsen, who is studying abroad in London this semester, are currently looking to fi llseveral fellowship positions that will develop the program’s technology, design management and event coordination over the summer. The offi cial website will launch in September.
Schneider hopes that Chief Information Offi cer Lisa Davis, who began her job in early February, will play an important role in the idea development process. The group has not had an offi cial meeting with administrators, however.
“We think there is a lot of potential for the university to help and make this idea sustainable,” Schneider said. “We don’t want the project to die away.”
For the time being, the project’s main priority is hiring a staff and enlisting professors to present lectures that they can fi lm. The group has reached agreements with 10 professors who will be featured in the fi rst round of videos, speaking on topics from storytelling to international politics.
“We really want to encourage students to access everything that Georgetown has to offer,” Schneider said.
According to Schneider, the duo is open to suggested revisions to their plan. They intend to reach out to oncampus groups to solicit videos and use social media to better communicate with the student body.
“We want [students] to be willing to reach outside of their job applications and run-of-the-mill school work,” he said. “We want to get students excited and curious.”

After a chance encounter with a monk in London, Gregory Robison, the director of the John Main Center for Meditation and Interreligious Dialogue at Georgetown, spent six months studying in a French Benedictine monastery.
This monastic experience with Brother John Main, a Benedictine monk, practitioner of Christian meditation and the namesake of the center, serves as the basis of Robison’s work on the Hilltop.
“Here at Georgetown, the students, faculty and staff who come to the John Main Center are looking for the same thing I sought at the age of 18: to cultivate an interior space, to integrate the disparate elements of a hectic life being tugged in different directions; to weed, water and prune that inner garden that we all have,” Robison said.
The center was founded in 2005 by former Georgetown professor Brother Laurence Freeman, O.S.B., who wanted to address a hunger for deeper spirituality that he saw in his students.
While it is one of the university’s newest spiritual institutions, the John Main Center is located inMcSherry Hall, the oldest building on campus. The center holds daily meditation sessions, offers free yoga classes every weekday and houses the Hindu Student Association’s weekly puja and Buddhist Meditation’s weekly sangha.
“Our sessions are open to those from diverse religious traditions — or from none. The heart of our sessions together is still and silent,” Robison said. “As my abbot told me when I was the age of an undergraduate, everyone who comes to the John Main Center are brothers and sisters whose liberty we respect.”
For the six students living in the Magis Row Meditation Houses, the sessions offered at the center are an extremely important part of both their Georgetown experience and their spiritual life.
“The Meditation Center definitely became a home away from home for me,” Harrison Gale (SFS ’13) said. “It’s a great way to zen oneself and insulate from Georgetown craziness. There are few chiller organizations imaginable — something about all forms of conflict resolution point to sitting quietly for 20 minutes.”
Gale and the other Magis Row residents also lead weekly meditation sessions as well as direct meditation backpacking trips and composting efforts for their neighbors.
“The Magis Row experience allows those of us who care deeply about meditation to live with or near each other, which fosters a spirit of community among meditators,” Madeline Collins (COL ’13) said.
The center also holds special events throughout the academic year. Each semester, the center partners with the Georgetown Library Associates to host the John Main Lecture, a discussion on how prayer intersects with academic disciplines. The center also sponsors the Good Heart Dialogue, a seminar designed to bring faiths together to reflect on their traditions and identify both similarities and differences.
While the center focuses on the Christian meditation tradition, it hopes to include members of all faith backgrounds.
“In the depths of our selves there are no formulations, no words, no images.” Robison said. “It is for this reason that we can sit in meditation together — Christians, Muslims, Jews, Jaines, Hindus, Buddhists and those with no faith or tradition.”

Last Tuesday, hundreds of applications from students hoping to study abroad flooded the Office of Overseas Studies. These applicants aspire to be among the 57 percent of Georgetown students who trade Healy Hall and chicken-finger Thursdays for Italian villas and baklava to spend a summer, a semester or a year studying at universities across the globe.
A GLOBAL GETAWAY
Many students complain about the need to “break the Georgetown bubble.” For some, that entails a quick trip to a Smithsonian museum or Eastern Market. For others, it can mean a semester-long trip halfway around the world.
“I think by junior year you get a little claustrophobic on campus,” Arielle Martins (COL ’12), who studied in St. Petersburg, Russia during the spring of 2011, said. “As soon as I decided to [go], I started to regret it immediately. I was like, ‘Oh my god, I’m finally happy, why am I leaving?’ and then the second I got there, I completely forgot about Georgetown.”
For students who don’t want to miss out on any part of their time on the Hilltop for social or academic reasons, summer programs like the one at Villa le Balze in Fiesole, Italy can be good alternatives.
“Being in the business school, it’s more difficult to study abroad … [because] the options are more limited,” Ellie Conlee (MSB ’12) said. “I knew it would be more difficult to go to the Villa during the year because all the classes offered there are obviously not business classes.”
Students such as current sophomore Alexandra Buck (COL ’14), who applied to study in St. Petersburg, Russia in fall 2012 and at the University College Dublin, Ireland in spring 2013, described the application process for studying abroad as highly time consuming.
“Most of it was fun, like picking classes and such, but some things are stressful — like the essays,” Buck wrote in an email.
DANGERS ABROAD
Last spring, the university evacuated students from two countries after a political uprising in Egypt and a deadly earthquake in Japan.
Hannah Walker’s (COL ’12) spring semester in Japan ended abruptly due to the earthquake.
Because of the disruption, Walker needed to take the remainder of the semester off, load up on summer classes and take a full schedule during her senior year.
Despite the extra work, Walker said she didn’t regret her decision to study abroad for a full year.
“I’m so glad that I made the full-year decision,” Walker said, citing her four months in Japan before the earthquake.
Sam Gerstle (COL ’13), who studied abroad in Nagoya, Japan last spring, stayed in the country to continue his program at Nanzan University in the aftermath of the earthquake.
“I’ve been studying Japanese for a long time and I’m a Japanese major, so I thought it would be the natural next step in my education to study in the actual country,” Gerstle wrote in an email. “I wasn’t really worried about the risk of radiation. Before I could get approval to go to Japan, I had to wait for the State Department to lift its travel warnings … and after they did I figured it would be safe.”
Bonnie Duncan (COL ’13) spent last semester studying in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, a city the State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs says is known for high rates of theft and violent crime. But Duncan said the experience of studying in such a unique environment outweighed potential risks.
“Going abroad, I really wanted to experience a culture that was foreign to my own in an unconventional place,” Duncan wrote in an email. “I tried to stay clear of Europe and was really drawn to countries that are considered the ‘third world.’ Obviously there is a cost associated with studying in a place like Vietnam … but unless you’re willing to take the risk, you’re going to miss out on a beautiful country and a once [in] a lifetime experience.”
Neyat Daniel (COL ’13), who split her junior year between Ghana and Turkey, made light of the dangerous reputation of places she has visited while abroad. “If anything happens to me [it will be] diabetes from the phenomenal baklava and Turkish delight,” she joked in an email.
A NEW VIEW FROM THE HILLTOP
While more than half of Georgetown students study abroad, the experience isn’t for everyone.
“There wasn’t a program I wanted,” Mike McClain (SFS ’12) said. “I’m paying so much for tuition that most … places I could go [abroad] would either not be worth the money … or would be like vacations.”
Internship deadlines also influence students to stay on campus during junior year.
“I was planning on [studying abroad] coming into Georgetown, but everyone goes abroad their junior year, and I had a job on campus which required me to stay,” Phil Chang (MSB ’12) said. “And [spring semester] was recruiting season. I didn’t want to miss that.”
McClain believes that staying at Georgetown while most of his friends went abroad provided him with a fresh outlook on D.C. “I think I got some of the benefits of studying abroad while everyone was gone,” McClain said. “It really shook up who I spent time with and what I did. … I had lived in D.C. for three years without really living in it so when a lot of my friends cleared out, I got a new perspective.”

A student was arrested for assaulting his roommate in Village B Saturday afternoon, according to the Department of Public Safety.
The Metropolitan Police Department initially responded to the scene, according to the DPS incident account.
MPD classified the incident as simple assault and reported that the victim sustained minor injuries to his right wrist and left elbow.
According to MPD, the victim, also a student, reported that he had a verbal altercation with the suspect over the victim’s property at 3:24 p.m. The suspect then entered the victim’s room without permission and pushed him into a desk, causing the injuries.
Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Services arrived at the scene to treat the victim but did not transport him to a hospital.
MPD classified the incident as intrafamily violence because the two students lived together.
According to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr, the incident is now being handled solely by MPD.
