O’Donovan Hall employees staged a demonstration at 12:35 p.m. today to voice frustration at the slow pace of contract negotiations for their recently formed union.
About 40 workers, accompanied by members of the Georgetown Solidarity Committee, gathered on the top floor of the dining hall, chanting phrases such as “What do we want? A contract. When do we want it? Now,” and “We’ll be back.”
The workers protested today to draw attention to delays in their negotiations with their employer Aramark Higher Education. Although the union for Leo’s employees was certified in March, employees say that they still have not been given fair wages or a more affordable health care program.
“What [the employees] want to show is that they’re united and they have the support of students,” Samuel Geaney-Moore (SFS ’12), a member of the Georgetown Solidarity Committee, said.
Geaney-Moore explained that the demonstration was a way for students, particularly those originally involved in the unionization efforts, to show support for the Leo’s employees’ campaign.
“It’s great to see the workers and students together. To me that’s the real meaning of solidarity,” Aramark employee and union leader Donté Crestwell wrote in a press release. “We are seeking a living wage, reasonable benefits, and a 40-hour work week for all. We’re glad that we’ve had the support of Georgetown students through this process.”
After the short demonstration, employees immediately returned to work and students from the GSC passed out flyers to inform students of the progress of negotiations thus far.

The Tocqueville Forum on the Roots of American Democracy is looking for a new leader after founder and director Patrick Deneen announced that he will resign from the university at the end of the semester.
Deneen, who will join the faculty at the University Notre Dame next year, expressed concerns about the university’s ability to find a replacement to lead the program.
According to Chester Gillis, dean of the College, the university expects to find a new director from within the current faculty.
“Georgetown affirms its commitment to continuing the work of the forum and will shortly confirm and announce the appointment of an interim director of the forum,” he wrote in an email. “Permanent leadership will likely emerge following internal discussion among academic leaders and faculty and perhaps in the context of current faculty searches.”
The Tocqueville Forum was founded in 2006 to study the Western philosophical and religious roots of the United States. It holds regular speaker events, which are open to the public, and reading groups for its over 70 student fellows. The forum also publishes an academic journal, Utraque Unum, sponsors courses and offers post-graduate fellowships.
Student fellows of the program voiced concerns that it will be difficult to find a new director who shares Deneen’s passion for the forum and who sees higher education in the same unique light he does.
“I think it will be difficult for someone to follow in his footsteps because he’s left such an impression,” Peter Prindiville (SFS ’14), a student fellow in the forum, said.
Deneen cited a lack of support for the forum among faculty and administrators as a factor in his decision to leave Georgetown.
“[Over] the years, it has been increasingly evident to me that I have exceedingly few allies and friends elsewhere on the faculty to join me in [the forum] and dim prospects that the trajectory of faculty hiring will change,” he wrote in an email to select students and in a post on his personal blog. “I have felt isolated from the heart of the institution where I have devoted so many of my hours and my passion.”
Gillis, however, described the Tocqueville Forum as one of the university’s integral programs.
“The forum has added significantly to the vibrancy and diversity of perspectives that make up the intellectual life of our university,” he wrote.

In a shift that will force the university to modify health insurance policies, new federal health care regulations will require most religiously affiliated employers to provide contraceptive coverage for employees.
Before the decision was announced by the Obama administration last Friday, religious institutions, including religiously affiliated universities, were exempt from providing contraceptive coverage as part of their employees’ health care benefits.
Currently, health insurance purchased or provided through Georgetown University and the Georgetown University Hospital does not include contraceptive coverage. However, employees may choose to subscribe to an alternative national plan that does provide such coverage, according to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr.
“Georgetown offers separate insurance plans to students and to employees that are tailored to our mission,” she wrote in an email.
In addition to providing university and hospital employees their choice of health insurance options, insurance plans provided by Georgetown are not mandatory for students.
In August 2011, the Department of Health and Human Services released a tentative list of rules and regulations that would be enacted under the auspices of the new Affordable Care Act, including the new policy on contraceptives. The policies were officially adopted last Friday.
Since the changes were proposed in August, Catholic and Jesuit institutions had been actively lobbying to allow exemptions for religiously affiliated universities.
The Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities — of which Georgetown is a member — expressed concerns with the regulations in a Sept. 26 letter to Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius.
“Compliance with these new rules would force us to deny our religious institutional heritage and identity by helping our students to act contrary to Catholic teaching and belief,” the letter read.
The policy has drawn mixed reactions from groups on campus.
H*yas for Choice Treasurer Brad Crist (SFS ’12) said that while the initiative may offend some, Georgetown and other religiously–affiliated organizations have an obligation to provide contraception.
“I understand how Obama’s policy may offend some conservative religious organizations. However, Georgetown must also protect the health and well-being of [its] female employees, and the benefits of birth control extend beyond just contraception,” Crist wrote in an email. “Birth control represents one of the largest costs to women today, and, in my opinion, if we want full health care coverage in this country, [it] should include birth control too.”
President of GU Right to Life Joseph Cardone (COL ’14) was concerned that the ruling would force Georgetown into conflict with its Catholic identity.
“I have a problem with the fact that Georgetown is being forced to provide things [it is] morally opposed to,” he said.
The exact timeline for the implementation of the Obama administration’s policies remains unclear. The rules released by the Department of Health and Human Services dictate that employers must comply by August 2012, but religious institutions may receive a one-year waiver before they are obliged to implement new policies.
Kerr said that Georgetown will comply with all federal regulations.
“If there are any changes to the law, Georgetown will continue to provide health insurance that is legally compliant,” she wrote. “We will be reviewing and evaluating the new regulations, ever mindful of our Catholic and Jesuit identity and mission.”

The Corp is reevaluating its security policies after $3,500 worth of cigarettes was stolen from Vital Vittles Monday and employees deterred another attempted theft two days later.
In the latest incident at the convenience store, an unknown suspect attempted to access the hallway to the store room in which inventory is held. Employees stopped the suspect from entering the hallway but did not detain him. The Department of Public Safety and the Metropolitan Police Department were notified of the incident and are handling the investigation.
The attempted theft followed a burglary of 50 cartons of cigarettes from the store Monday, which was the fourth incident at Vittles this school year.
In September, employees who were restocking inventory discovered that 90 cartons of cigarettes had been stolen. Three months later, on Dec. 1, a suspect stole more than $200 in cash from a Vittles office. A further $1,500 in cigarettes was stolen Dec. 6.
“I think that Vittles has been pretty clearly identified as a place from which it is pretty easy to steal and get away unnoticed,” said Alex Pon (COL ’12), CEO of Students of Georgetown, Inc. “We take this very seriously, and … we’re taking steps to make [Vittles] less attractive.”
According to Pon, these steps include working with the University Facilities and Student Housing to restrict access to the hallway behind Vittles that leads to offices and storage areas and to improve the lock on the doors to the store room. The Corp is also focused on implementing measures to ensure the safety of employees.
“Nobody has felt unsafe, but we don’t know whether the suspect [was] armed,” Pon said. “Our main concern is our employees’ safety.”
According to Pon, suspects have been stealing cigarettes by walking through Vittles and picking the lock on the door leading to the storage area.
“People are in and out of there all the time. … You can’t see the entire hallway from one end to the other,” he said.
Usually, the thefts are not noticed until employees take inventory and realize that items are missing.
In the December and January cases, employees were able to review video footage of the suspects captured on security cameras and provide images to officers investigating the incidents. The cameras were installed in Vital Vittles and Hoya Snaxa last semester as part of The Corp’s ongoing security upgrades.
However, no suspects have yet been apprehended in any of the incidents.
“MPD and DPS have been very good at responding, but unfortunately, we haven’t made a whole lot of progress in pursuing the suspects,” Pon said.
Suspects in the two most recent thefts were both described in Metropolitan Police Department incident reports as Hispanic males between the ages of 25 and 40, with a medium build and a light complexion.
Pon said that it is unclear whether the thefts are connected but he noted similarities between the suspects in the incident on Wednesday and previous thefts.
“In my unexpert opinion it was a person who looked very similar to the people we have seen on our security footage in the past,” he said.
Though The Corp has insurance against thefts, no decision has been made to file a claim regarding Monday’s incident.
Despite the recurring thefts, Pon said that he believes the new security measures will help prevent future incidents.
“We are definitely disappointed by all these situations. We’re trying to run a business so we can best serve Georgetown, and unfortunately, these thefts make it more difficult for us to do so,” he said. “But I truly do believe we are on the right track to addressing a lot of the concerns.”

In an annual celebration of Jesuit traditions, the university will hold its 12th annual Jesuit Heritage Week from Jan. 29 to Feb. 4.
“It’s a week when we celebrate our roots and engage our Georgetown faculty, students and community in our heritage,” Alma Caballero (SFS ’13), co-chair of the Jesuit Heritage Week Committee, said. “It’s not only for the Catholic community. We try to engage every single faith and student on campus. We break the normal routine and identify with what our university really means.”
Michael Fischer (SFS ’13), the other co-chair of Jesuit Heritage Week and a columnist for The Hoya, believes that the events provide opportunities not only to appreciate the Jesuit tradition but also to give thanks to the Jesuits at Georgetown.
“The Jesuits are a humble group, yet they give so much of their time, talent and lives to make Georgetown the place it is and make us Hoyas who we are,” he wrote in an email.
The week will include a variety of academic, spiritual and service events, beginning with an opening mass in Gaston Hall Sunday evening.
According to Caballero, many of the other planned events were shaped by the desire of members of the student committee to reflect on their own personal faith backgrounds.
Events will range from talks on women’s role in the church and Jesuits in Latin America and Africa to the popular Spike-a-Jesuit volleyball tournament. The week’s festivities will also include a conversation about Jesuit identity with students at the School of Foreign Service in Qatar.
“We interact with our Doha students and bring Jesuit Heritage Week to them, and I think that’s really important and interesting because the majority of those students are not Catholic, yet they’re still celebrating their Jesuit identity,” Caballero said. “It’s an interfaith dialogue.”

After its first semester, the Student Advocacy Office has developed a foundation to serve as a resource to help students navigate the disciplinary process, its directors said.
The SAO, a project developed by the Georgetown University Student Association’s executive branch, has been working to establish a successful partnership with the Office of Student Conduct since the initiative kicked off in early fall 2011.
Although all student meetings are confidential, SAO co-director Ace Factor (COL ’12) said that the majority of cases the office works with are Category A violations, the least serious and most common category of offense, which includes alcohol and noise violations. The directors declined to give a rough estimate of the number of students served.
The advocates have also helped students by answering questions about the Code of Student Conduct and acting as a resource for those who need help understanding the disciplinary system.
According to James Pickens (COL ’12), co-director of the SAO, the most recent meeting with the Disciplinary Review Committee, the university’s student disciplinary system, was focused on expanding the group’s presence on campus.
“We specifically discussed ways for Residence Life and Student Conduct to work together with the SAO to help students through the disciplinary process,” he said. “I believe we have been officially recognized by the university, both as [an offshoot] of the GUSA executive [branch] and as a legitimate part of campus life.”
The newly-created office received almost 60 applications at the beginning of the academic year from hopefuls wanting to become student advocates. Although only 18 applicants were selected, the enthusiasm was encouraging, according to Factor.
“We had more applicants than we needed. I think that’s a good thing. I think it shows that student rights on campus are something people care about,” he said.
The new advocates undergo a strict training process that requires meetings with the Office of Residential Life and Director of Student Conduct Judy Johnson. The process ensures that all advocates have a firm understanding of the disciplinary system and are adequately able to help students, Factor said.
Pickens and Factor have also been working on adding a Bill of Student Rights and Responsibilities to the university’s Code of Student Conduct.
Although Pickens and Factor are graduating this semester, they hope that the office will continue to provide for students in the future.
“One of our biggest goals is having it continue,” Factor said. “It really depends on another group of committed students to help continue that.”

When Anja Frost (COL ’12) and Ashley Sharp (COL ’12) founded the Georgetown chapter of GlobeMed, a national organization that helps provide health care and education in Guatemala, they were hoping to fill a void on campus.
“Georgetown is such an internationally-focused school, but before we didn’t have a global health club, which is odd since there are basically three majors at Georgetown dedicated to global health,” current Co-President Anna Trakhtenberg (SFS ’13) said.
GlobeMed, a national organization founded at Northwestern University, links student groups from 46 different American college campuses with individual health organizations in developing countries around the globe.
Last semester, the group raised more than $6,500 through bake sales and individual donations to support a new nutrition program at Primeros Pasos, a health clinic based in the Palajunoj Valley in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. The clinic works in the surrounding rural communities to provide health care and education to the area’s youth.
Lisa Convery, the clinic’s development director, estimated that in the past few years the clinic has treated almost half of the children and adolescents living in those areas, or about 3,000 patients annually. Many of these children would otherwise be at risk for deadly but preventable diseases like appendicitis.
“There’s highly limited access to public health care for people in the rural areas, and there’s no health education in any of the curriculums in their public education system,” Convery said. “That’s why it’s so important that organizations like GlobeMed … provide the services needed to marginalized communities.”
The organization now hopes to raise a total of $10,000, which will go toward hiring a nutritionist to assess the needs of Palajunoj Valley’s population and distribute vitamins and other nutritional supplements.
Four to five members of GlobeMed at Georgetown will also visit Primeros Pasos this summer to volunteer at the clinic and in the surrounding community.
“The unique thing about us is that we actually get to go there and see the people you’re helping,” Club Secretary Sheena Karkal (COL ’15) said. “I’m really excited to get to talk to the kids, tell them what’s a proper meal and how to take care of themselves [and] help people who don’t have access to the things we take for granted.”

O’Donovan Hall employees staged a demonstration at about 12:35 p.m. Thursday to voice frustration at the slow pace of contract negotiations between the union they formed last year and their employer, Aramark Higher Education.
About 40 Georgetown University Dining Services employees, accompanied by members of the Georgetown Solidarity Committee, gathered on the top floor of the dining hall, chanting phrases such as “What do we want? A contract. When do we want it? Now,” and “We’ll be back.” Students not involved with the GSC also joined as the demonstration grew.
“It really showed how much Georgetown students care about workers in their community,” GSC member Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) said.
The union operates under the umbrella of UNITE HERE, a national organization for food service employees, and includes employees of Leo’s, the Jesuit Residence, Cosi, Starbucks and the Preclinical Building’s Dr. Mug.
Although the union was certified in March, members say that they still have not been given fair wages or a more affordable health care program. According to Kohnert-Yount, Aramark employees pay more for health care than any other group of workers at Georgetown.
“What [the employees] want to show is that they’re united and they have the support of students,” Samuel Geaney-Moore (SFS ’12), a GSC member, said.
Geaney-Moore explained that the demonstration was a way for students, particularly those originally involved in the unionization efforts, to show support for the employees’ campaign.
“It’s great to see the workers and students together. To me that’s the real meaning of solidarity,”Aramark employee and union leader Donté Crestwell wrote in a press release. “We are seeking a living wage, reasonable benefits and a 40-hour work week for all. We’re glad that we’ve had the support of Georgetown students through this process.”
Thursday’s participants kept the demonstration a secret until it began during the lunchtime rush on a day on which Aramark officials were on campus.
After the short demonstration, employees immediately returned to work, and members of the GSC passed out flyers to inform students of the progress of negotiations thus far.

While Georgetown may seem to be bustling with undergraduates, the university also serves as a hub for parents and advocates for the improvement of elementary education.
Mom Congress, an initiative that partners with the School of Continuing Studies, boasts over 25,000 members, both male and female, who are passionate about seeking reforms in their children’s school systems.
The program, which was launched by Parenting Magazine in 2009, advocates for positive change in the education system across the United States.
“There are cases where parents are stepping up and making change in schools all across the country. It can be a case of homework policy. In other cases it’s better playgrounds and funding for school libraries. Parents are taking a more active role and that’s how Mom Congress was born,” Catherine McManus, director of brand communications and partnership at The Parenting Group, said.
Robert L. Manuel, dean of the SCS, contacted Parenting Magazine to create the partnership in the fall of 2008 after learning about parents’ work to raise awareness for educational reform.
“[The] SCS has been a wonderful partner since the very beginning, and our goal was to give parents all across the country the tools and resources that they need to effect change,” McManus said.
Parenting Magazine, in partnership with the congress, chooses 51 education advocates, representing each state and the District of Columbia, to attend the annual Mom Congress on Education and Learning Conference, which is held at Georgetown University. During the event in late April, parents meet with the prominent education leaders to discuss the importance of family engagement.
At the inaugural conference in May 2010, the delegates joined hundreds of local education and community leaders in a town hall on parental engagement in education with U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, who has been a constant presence at the conference for the past two years.
“The Department of Education really has been a wonderful partner with Mom Congress, and they see these women as advocates for children … and understand the power that they have,” McManus said.
The focus of the conference changes each year, as a new theme is presented and new issues are addressed.
“We’re constantly learning new things. We’re not only responding to what the Department of Education and some education leaders are telling us is important, we’re listening to the moms as well who have played a huge role in the development of this campaign,” McManus said.
According to Kelly Holdcraft, university liaison for Mom Congress and director of the paralegal studies program at the SCS, versatility is a key asset of the initiative.
“The beauty of the conference and Mom Congress itself is that we have the opportunity to address issues in different ways,” she said. “Something else we’re learning about Mom Congress as we go along is that it’s very much an evolution. Each year we have the opportunity to evolve it based on what’s happening with education advocacy issues.”
One result of the inaugural conference in 2010 was the “Lesson Plan for Change,” a guide created to empower parents to involve themselves in their children’s educations. The guide was drafted by Parenting Magazine editors, the Mom Congress advisory board and SCS faculty.
Students from SCS’s Masters of Professional Studies in Public Relations and Corporate Communications program as well as from the journalism program have also assisted in the efforts.
As the educational partner to Mom Congress, the School of Continuing Studies works to help the delegates ground their campaign in facts.
“At the SCS, our role is [that of a] problem solver. [We] identify a problem and convene people around that problem. [We] bring people together,” Holdcraft said.
The conferences help garner more attention to education issues, and though Mom Congress has not yet brought about national legislative changes, it has had success locally, according to McManus.
“I would not say we effect legislation on a national level, but a lot of the goal is to provide these women with the tools that they can go back to their communities with and lobby for changes to state or local legislation,” she said.
As a developing grassroots organization, Mom Congress has helped emphasize the conversations about education that are taking place across the nation.
“So many different success stories have come out of this small group of women,” Holdcraft said.
