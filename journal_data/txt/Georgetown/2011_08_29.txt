As the nation’s first modern art museum, Dupont’s The Phillips Collection houses a permanencollection of modern 20th-century art (both international and local) in the 1897 home of founder Duncan Phillips. On display this fall is “Degas’s Dancers at the Barre: Point and Counterpoint,” running from Oct. 1 to Jan. 8. The exhibit takes an in-depth look into the impressionist’s famous subjects: ballerinas.
The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculputre Garden is the nation’s leading center for contemporary art and culture on the National Mall. Currently featured is “Color-Forms,” which explores how Western artists from the 1960s to modern times use color in a variety of mediums through Nov. 13. Be sure to watch out for “Andy Warhol: Shadows” — coming up Sept. 25 to Jan. 15 — which will feature distorted photographs of shadows generated in the artist’s studio as organized and presented by the Dia Art Foundation.
America’s most influential poets, heroes and villains are displayed in the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery, located on the corner of Eighth and F Streets NW. Currently featured through Oct. 14, 2012 is “Portraiture Now: Asian American Portraits of Encounters” that displays several works of seven global artists displaying contemporary Asian-American portraiture.
D.C.’s top ballet company, The Washington Ballet looks to bring us back to prohibition era jazz with a revival dance interpretation of The Great Gatsby. The show runs from Nov. 2 to 6 and ticket sales open on Sept. 11. If F. Scott’s not your favorite, wait until December to get your ballet fix with seasonal favorite The Nutcracker playing frequently throughout the month.
The National Symphony Orchestra celebrates its 80th anniversary this season and kicks off with the Season Opening Ball Concert on Sept. 25 with acclaimed violinist Joshua Bell featuring the work ofDvorák, Bruch, Copland and Ravel. If you miss the opener, there are many other outstanding programs ahead, like a performance running from Nov. 17 through 19 featuring Beethoven’s Symphony No. 6 “Pastoral” and Brahms’ Violin Concerto.
The Kennedy Center, D.C.’s most well-known and busiest venue for the performing arts, boasts a bevy of classical music, dance and theater and more events this fall. Classic excursions are going to a performance by the National Symphony Orchestra, available almost every weekend, or starting the school year off with a trip to see the Washington National Opera perform the Italian crowd-pleaser”Tosca” in September, the tragic tale of a singer, her artist lover, and the conniving police chief set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic wars.
The non-profit Arena Stage, located on the Southwest Waterfront, underwent a $125 million renovation last year and since then has focused on bringing American classics to life. From August through October 2, it will be presenting “Oklahoma!,” Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Academy Award-winning musical about the romance between a cowboy and a farm girl on the Great Plains. The Shakespeare Theatre, acclaimed as one of the best classical theaters nationwide, is performing the Bard’s famed comedy “Much Ado About Nothing” almost every day in late November and December. For those looking to branch out, the theater is also presenting an adaptation of Regnard’s “The Heir Apparent” in September and October.
The Folger Shakespeare Library on Capitol Hill aside from containing the
world’s largest collection of printed Shakespeare works, also has a small
courtyard theater that presents the Bard’s classics. This October and November,
go see one of the great four tragedies “Othello,” the sad tale of romance, betrayal and racism in Venice.

Metro
D.C.’s Metro is hailed for its simplicity and relative cleanliness. Even though Georgetown doesn’t have its own stop, odds are you’ll frequent the three stops closest to us:Dupont Circle on the Red line, and Foggy Bottom-GWUand Rosslyn, both on the Orange and Blue lines. Cost of a ride runs from $1.35 to $1.85 depending on distance and time of day. The Metro runs until 12 a.m all days except Friday and Saturday, when it’s open until 3 a.m. (Be warned: Late night trains are unreliable.)
Farecards can be used for multiple trips but we recommend that you purchase a SmarTrip card for $5 since they won’t demagnetize, which thefarecards tend to do. Not to mention, you’ll get a 25 cent discount and can deactivate your account if you lose track of this convenient card. SmarTrips can also be used for all buses except the Georgetown Metro Connection and can be purchased online at wmata.com or at Metro stations and CVS. Also handy is the downloadable Metrorail map for your iPod, available at wmata.com/ipod.
You can walk to the Metro or take the free Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle (GUTS) service, which runs from across Epicurean & Co. for Dupont Circle and by the tennis courts forRosslyn. The Rosslyn GUTS also stops in front of Car Barn. GUTS buses run every 20 minutes until 11 p.m. on weekdays but only hourly on weekends. Don’t forget your GOCard in case the conductor cracks down on ID checks.
Buses
Other buses include the Georgetown Metro Connection, known as the “Blue Bus.” Shuttles run every 10 minutes between Rosslyn and Dupont, with stops all along M Street. These buses operate later than most, shutting down at 12 a.m. during the week and at 2 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. Each ride will cost you $1.50. If the above options don’t get you where you want to go, Metrobus certainly will with its wide coverage. Georgetown relevant lines include the G2 route which picks up at the Healy Gates every 20 minutes and runs to Dupont Circle for $1.35 a ride ($1.25 with SmarTrip). If you’re trying to get to Dupont from Burleith, take the D2 and D6 lines . The 38B line is a lesser-known bus that runs from along M Street to the Rosslyn Metro stop.
The D.C Circulator is yet another bus service running every 10 minutes from 7 a.m to 9 p.m with its closest campus stops picking up at the intersections of both N and O streets and Wisconsin. The red line runs north and south along 7th and 9th Streets from the Convention Center to the Southwest Waterfront, the pink line loops around the National Mall, and the orange line runs along K Street from Georgetown to Union Station. It’s the cheapest at $1, but its numerous stops are both a blessing and a curse, cutting back on walking time but often boosting overall travel time.
Taxis
While ideally Washington’s shuttles, buses and Metro will take you wherever you need to go, sometimes you must resort to a taxi. You’ll pay a $3 fixed rate plus 25 cents for every onesixth of a mile traveled after the first sixth. Other costs include $1.50 for additional passengers and various fees for calling a dispatcher, stopping or luggage. Cabs circle around campus regularly but it is smart to call if you know you’ll need one ahead of time. Yellow Cab D.C. can be reached at 202.544.1212.
Schlepping it to the Airport
Trekking to the airport on time can be a harder task than you think, especially in a post-finals haze. For a cab to Reagan National Airport, you’ll pay about $20; to Dulles International Airport, a hefty $50. Baltimore-Washington International (BWI) and Dulles can also be reached via SuperShuttle for $27 to $35 for the first person and $10 for each additional passenger. Without a taxi, you can reach BWI via Marc or Amtrak train for $6 to $12 dollars from Union Station. For Dulles, you can also take the 5Ametrobus, although it’s a long ride. For Reagan, take the Blue line from Rosslyn.
The number and diversity of transportation options around the city may at first glance seem daunting, but once you get the hang of it, you’ll enjoy showing off your savvy. The sooner you start learning the ropes, the easier it will be to take advantage of what the city has to offer.

As a Division I school, Georgetown provides no shortage of entertainment options for sports fans. But for those that want to witness some high-level competition beyond the Hilltop, Washington provides plenty of options. Though none of the local teams have been especially successful lately, the District boasts five professional sports teams.
WASHINGTON REDSKINS
National Football League
The Redskins compete in the NFC East — perennially one of the League’s toughest divisions — and have struggled of late, putting together only one winning season in the last five years. Last season saw constant drama between Head Coach Mike Shanahan and several of his players and included an embarrassing 59-28 loss to rival Philadelphia. After shipping off frustrating defensive tackle AlbertHaynesworth, oft-injured running back Clinton Portis and disappointing quarterback Donovan McNabb this offseason, Shanahan and the Redskins front offi ce are clearly looking to rebuild in 2011. They shored up the defensive line in the draft and have a strong backfi eldanchored by Tim Hightower, but concerns remain about the inconsistent Rex Grossman as a long-term solution at quarterback. The Redskins play at FedEx Field in Landover, Md. — not an easy trip for Georgetown students. But if you can score a ticket, a ‘Skins-Eagles showdown is quite an experience.
WASHINGTON WIZARDS
National Basketball Association
Aside from exciting but short playoff runs in 2005 and 2006, the Washington Wizards franchise has struggled to elevate itself from the Eastern Conference basement in the last decade. However, it looks like all that might change soon. 2010 No. 1 overall draft pick John Wall had a stellar rookie year while healthy and should receive scoring help from veteran forwards Josh Howard and Rashard Lewis. Add in the continued improvement of shooting guard and forward Nick Young, center JaVale McGee and forward Andray Blatche, and the Wizards appear to have a bright future. DC sports enthusiasts will also be glad to hear that this season the franchise will be ditching its current color in favor of the red, white and blue it wore up until 1997, when the name was changed to the Wizards. The Wizards play in downtown D.C. at the Verizon Center, where Georgetown men’s basketball games are held.
WASHINGTON NATIONALS
Major League Baseball
Since relocating from Montreal in 2005, the Nationals have not fi nished a season above the .500 mark or better than fourth in their division, the National League East. But like their basketball counterparts, the franchise has hope for the future. Right-handed pitcher Stephen Strasburg, the 2009 No. 1 draft pick, has been sidelined for much of the 2010 and 2011 season after undergoing Tommy John surgery in August 2010. However, the much-hyped rookie set a team record for strikeouts in his fi rst ever start last season and is expected to return to the fi eld this August or September. Similarly hyped outfi elder Bryce Harper, the No. 1 draft pick in 2010, probably won’t be called up for at least another year, but can be counted on to make an impact whenever he makes it to the big leagues. Games are held at the Metro-accessible Nationals Park on the Anacostia River. Tickets are relatively inexpensive (and you can usually have your pick of upper-deck seats once you’ve gotten into the stadium) and a student ID will land you a 50 percent discount at many games.
WASHINGTON CAPITALS
National Hockey League
The Capitals are by far the most successful of the District’s professional sports teams in recent years, capturing the NHL’s Southeast Division title in each of the last four seasons. Star winger AlexanderOvechkin has been among the scoring leaders in the NHL since his rookie year in 2004, and centerNicklas Backstrom joined him in lighting up opponents in 2007. However, the Caps’ regularseasonsuccess and potent offense hasn’t translated to postseason success yet. The Caps share the Verizon Center with the Wizards and may be the only pro attraction there this year if the NBA is locked out.
DC UNITED
Major League Soccer
The most successful club in MLS history and winners of three of the fi rst four MLS Cups, DC United have fallen on harder times recently. United has just one title in the past decade, no other fi nalsappearances during that span, and fi nished dead last in the MLS last year. This year has been marginally better as United sit in sixth in the Eastern conference and are led by this year’s feel-good story in Charlie Davies and veteran playmaker Dwayne de Rosario, who has bagged six goals in just six appearances for the team. The team plays its home games at RFK stadium and should only get more exciting to watch as Davies comes closer to recovering the form that made him a starter for the US National team before an October 2009 car crash threatened to end his career.

Alabaster columns. Majestic bronze statues. Staffers rushing by in their finest Brooks Brothers suits, theclickclack of their heels or wingtips echoing through marbled halls.
The Hill, that anchor of the National Mall, tends to be a focal point of tourist paraphernalia (or the taboo political argument at the dinner table). Thankfully, you can put both preconceptions to rest, because the area surrounding the District’s most recognizable dome has come into its own – and it’s well worth the trek.
Convinced Georgetown and Dupont Circle lay claim to the best of D.C. food? Think again, and remember that even our congressmen and women (and their abundance of staffers) need dependable eateries close to work.
Venture over to Capitol Hill when you have the chance (and a bad case of cravings) and head straight to Good Stuff Eatery. You have yet to experience the best of burgers until you sidle up to the counter and order a Farmhouse Burger and a Toasted Marshmallow Milkshake at this two-story joint. Run by Top Chef all-star Spike Mendelsohn, this gem of the Hill entices politicos who storm through the halls of Congress as well as District natives. If homemade burgers don’t tickle your fancy, then walk right next door to We the Pizza, which will perfectly sate your hunger. Also owned by Spike, We the Pizza has some good wings, but true to their name, they excel in the field of pizza. If you want something light with loads of garlic, order a White Pie.
Torn between Good Stuff Eatery and We the Pizza? Fear not, for Matchbox Capitol Hill blends the best of each. With trendy appetizers and cocktails, this vintage pizza bistro is only minutes from the Eastern Market Metro stop, providing you easy access and cheap transportation. Should you feel adventurous, order the brussels sprouts side dish. Leave your childhood qualms at home, because these brussels sprouts are sliced, sauteed, tossed with bacon bits and topped with Gorgonzola cheese — an explosion of flavor that is well worth savoring. To top it off, Matchbox, though a destination restaurant, only has a minutes-long wait to get a table even when the place is packed. If you’re yearning for a slice of Capitol Hill that isn’t overrun by tour buses full of eighth graders, take a step beyond the halls of Congress.
A local favorite with eclectic fare, Eastern Market deserves a place on every Hoya’s to-do list. Operating for over 136 years, Eastern Market is D.C.’s oldest continually operated public market, and a fixture of the Southeast D.C. community. Inside the market building, merchants offer an array of fresh produce, meats and cheeses. The glass counter at the Fine Sweet Shop glows with a tempting assortment of homemade cakes, cookies, tarts and breads.
For one of the best breakfast deals in town, stop by Market Lunch, also located within the market. Just be sure to go early since they stop serving breakfast at 11 a.m. on Saturdays (and forget about heading over on a Sunday, when this eatery serves lunch exclusively). Forming a line out the door, customers here ache for their fix of blueberry buckwheat pancakes. “Blue Bucks” in the Washingtonian vernacular, these sweet treats are delicious, healthy (blueberries, right?) and a mere $5.25. If you’re craving something more savory, the market also cooks up a hearty breakfast sandwich, “The Brick.” As its name suggests, the sandwich is unabashedly oversized, its homemade biscuit filled with your choice of meat (bacon, sausage, or ham), cheese, eggs and fried potatoes. Or for a taste of local Chesapeake fare, sample the crab cake eggs benedict. For those among you who can’t roll out of bed in time for Market Lunch’s breakfast hours, consider a crabcake sandwich, Carolina BBQ pulled pork sandwich or a side of fried green tomatoes. Tap into your inner Southerner and wash it all down with a sweet tea.
On Sundays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., the Flea Market houses roughly 100 exhibitors, spanning five continents and selling everything from vintage tablecloths to miniature Buddha figurines to alpaca hats. Featuring many vintage and antique trinkets, the market is an ideal destination for a distinctive gift that doesn’t cost you your whole student-guard paycheck. At some notable stalls, you’ll find silver jewelry from Tibet, tapestries from Ghana or hand-knit gloves from Peru. Just steps from the Capitol, you not only find yourself at the nation’s crossroads, but at the world’s, too.

Beneath the famous Friendship Archway at H and 7th Streets lies the entrance to one of the District’s mostwellknown and culturally inspired neighborhoods, Chinatown. Only blocks away from the Verizon Center, the district is most visited for its restaurants and annual parade commemorating the Chinese New Year.
Each year, Chinatown celebrates the new year holiday with a parade, Chinese Dragon Dances, live musical performances and a host of other activities. The Chinese New Year is a 15-day celebration which begins with the New Moon on the first day of the new year and ends on the full moon two weeks later. This year, the new year will fall on Feb. 3. Keep in mind that during the festivities, it is customary for both performers and spectators to wear red, a color which is believed to aid in warding off evil spirits.
Chinatown spans nearly five blocks and contains approximately 20 Chinese, Asian and Asian-inspired restaurants, all within walking distance. While the neighborhood has recently played host to an increasing number of American chains such as Starbucks, Hooters, McCormick & Schmick’s and Legal Seafoods, it still maintains a firm grip on its Asian roots.
Today, many of its Asian restaurants are family-owned and operated. Of note is Ping Pong Dim Sum on 7th Street. Despite the restaurant’s seemingly informal name, Ping Pong is actually an upscale venue, offering an extensive menu of dim sum or, in Ping Pong’s words, “little steamed parcels ofdeliciousness.” These range from traditional dishes such as spicy pork and seafood dumplings to those better suited to the more intrepid, such as black prawn dumplings in black squid ink pastry.
Wok & Roll is another restaurant worth a visit, representing both them area’s Asian culture as well as the American history that D.C. is known for: The restaurant occupies a house which once served as the meeting place for John Wilkes Booth and his fellow conspirators in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in nearby Ford’s Theatre. Alongside this heaping slice of Americana, the restaurant serves the best of both Japanese and Chinese cuisine, including Peking Duck, Soft Shell Crab and a variety of sushi during happy hour from Monday to Friday from 4 to 7 p.m.
After a basketball game this season, stop in for happy hour at Wok & Roll, dim sum at Ping Pong, or try any one of the Chinese dives beneath the famous Friendship Archway. A couple caveats: dining in this area can be pricey, and the surrounding neighborhood is dicey, especially at night. The unique culinary and cultural delights to be found here outweigh whatever reservations you may still have, however. Forget it, Jake. It’s Chinatown.
