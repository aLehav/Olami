Former AOL CEO Steve Case addressed the McDonough School of Business Class of 2014 in his commencement address Saturday, encouraging them to be bold and embrace the entrepreneurial spirit upon which America was built.
 

Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates (GRD ’74) urged members of the School of Foreign Service’s Class of 2014 to pursue public service and recognize the United States’ responsibility in the global arena Saturday.
 

American Association for the Advancement of Science CEO Alan Leshner advised School of Nursing and Health Studies graduates to follow a non-linear career path and pursue what they love in his commencement address Saturday afternoon.
 

Vatican astronomer Br. Guy Consolmagno, S.J., addressed the Georgetown College Class of 2014 in a speech this morning, focusing on the role of truth in education.
 
 

After a months-long selection process led by the deans of each Georgetown school, commencement speakers for tomorrow’s undergraduate ceremonies include former Defense Secretary Robert Gates (GRD ’74), former AOL CEO Steve Case, Vatican astronomer Br. Guy Consolmagno, S.J., and American Association for the Advancement of Science CEO Alan Leshner.
 

Graduation ceremonies for the Class of 2014 kicked off as graduating seniors presented a class gift of $155,640.40 to the university during the convocation ceremony Thursday afternoon.
 
 
This year’s five valedictorians and dean’s medal recipients, with a tie in the College, will be honored this weekend for their GPAs — four 4.0s and one 3.97.
 

Students at the School of Foreign Service in Qatar graduated Saturday, May 10 — a week before commencement for seniors at the main campus — in a ceremony attended by University President John J. DeGioia.
 
 
The champions and benefactors of our college experience deserve more thanks than we could express through mere words. Yet, on the most climactic day of college amid graduates’ own commencement, a moment of recognition is a good place to start.
 

“The seasonal tides of my Georgetown experience shed light on both the lows and highs of my undergraduate life. For all of its beauty and grace, Georgetown still testifies to transformational moments when I questioned my own happiness and sense of self.”
 

“Being at Georgetown has shown me what the truth is. I have discovered that, while having a prestigious job with a nice salary would be nice, the most important thing in life is to know, love and serve God.”
 

“While I came to Georgetown for the academics, I stayed for the uphill battles of self-discovery, community formation and social justice that I found on campus.”
 
 

“We all owe Georgetown thanks for the nights and days that taught the things we never even expected we wanted to know.”
 
 

“The Beatles’ ‘In My Life’ strikes a deep chord. ‘There are places I remember / all my life though some have changed. / Some forever, not for better. / Some have gone and some remain. / All these places have their moments with lovers and friends. I still can recall. / Some are dead and some are living. / In my life I’ve loved them all.’”
 

“As a preface to this senior commentary, I must admit I enjoy social media. If the 11 endorsements I have for social media skills on LinkedIn are not enough sway, perhaps the fact that I posted on social media continuously during finals week will convince you. It is only fitting, therefore, that as an ode to this love I discovered at Georgetown, I honor my senior commentary in the form of a BuzzFeed post. (Also, I am in the MSB. We don’t write paragraphs.)”
 

“To the undergraduates who are so lucky to have time left at this magical place, follow your passions. Work tons of hours at a job you enjoy, stay up until the sun rises studying what you love and spend time with company that makes you smile.”

Former AOL CEO Steve Case addressed the McDonough School of Business Class of 2014 in his commencement address Saturday, encouraging them to be bold and embrace the entrepreneurial spirit upon which America was built.
The ceremony, which began at 6 p.m., conferred upon the graduates bachelor’s of science degrees. The top 10 percent of the class was inducted into Beta Gamma Sigma, the national scholastic honor society in the field of business administration, and over 100 graduates received their degrees with Latin honors.
Before his commencement address, Case received the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters. Professor Bill Novelli, the director of the Global Social Enterprise Initiative, read the honorary degree citation, noting Case’s profound influence on the world of business. The Case Foundation donated $100,000 to the Global Social Enterprise Initiative in January, and Case’s wife, Jean Case, is the initiative’s executive-in-residence.
“For his own stunning impact, for his unerringly right passion and for his exemplary perspective on the intersection of the individual, the political and the public, today Georgetown University, with admiration and fraternity, confers on Steven M. Case, the degree of Doctor of Humane Letters, honoris causa.”
After the address, the Class of 2014 received their diplomas, led by Michael J. Lee (MSB ’14), the valedictorian of the class.
Case began his address by noting how in today’s world, graduates have the opportunity for multiple careers, and their current choices will not necessarily dictate where they find themselves later in life.
He called them to embrace this flexibility by taking risks, and he provided them with three guidelines by which to find success: “The three p’s: people, passion and perseverance,” Case said.
Understanding how to use their relationships to achieve their goals and not wavering in their commitment to those goals, he said, would allow the graduates to obtain success.
“Your ultimate success or failure will largely be determined by how you galvanize others to work with you and stand by you,” Case said.
Case  also called on graduates to join in the “third wave” of the Internet.
“Now we’re entering the third wave, where we’re integrating the Internet into everyday life … really reimagining and reinventing education, and health care, and transportation and energy,” he said.
According to Case, this third wave will require two additional p’s: “policy and partnership.” Graduates must understand the ever-changing nature of the landscape that governs the Internet and continue to cooperate with others to be successful in it.
Although the third wave will be more difficult to realize one’s goals in, Case said graduates were already well positioned to achieve because of what they learned at Georgetown.
“You [understand] that government and policy matters and that the social sector also matters. And you likely chose to focus your studies here on business because you believe business can be a force for good. So you’ve got a nice head start,” he said.
Case denoted how America was founded on entrepreneurship, and now as other countries are turning toward it to power their economies, graduates must understand the power of entrepreneurship and ensure that America continues to be a leader.
“Entrepreneurship matters because it has the potential to close the opportunity gap and to genuinely improve the quality of life for everyone, everywhere,” Case said.
Attendees thought the speech provided good advice on how to achieve success.
“I thought it was accurate advice on how to live in our current world and how to succeed in the upcoming one,” Min Lee (COL ’16), a student in attendance, said. “A lot of it was made up of gems of wisdom that … put together makes up pretty invaluable insight.”

Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates (GRD ’74) urged members of the School of Foreign Service’s Class of 2014 to pursue public service and recognize the United States’ responsibility in the global arena Saturday.
The ceremony, which honored the conferral of bachelors of science to the graduating seniors, began at 3 p.m.
Gates received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters “for his leadership on foreign policy and his exemplary contribution to the security of the American people and the troops that defend them,” according to the degree citation, read by Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies Director Angela Stent.
SFS Dean’s Medal recipient Michael Reher (SFS ’14) led the procession of graduates, who received their diplomas from University President John J. DeGioia and SFS Associate Dean Ambassador Andrew Steigman.
“I assume, as usual, most of these graduates will work in some place other than America’s diplomatic corps, but I’m assuming … whatever brought you here was a curiosity about the wider world,” Gates said in his address.
He cautioned against a political trend toward isolationism, citing the United States’ powerful position as obligation to participate in world affairs and conflicts. Gates, whose Georgetown doctorate is in Russian and Soviet history, identified a swath of conflict zones and troubled areas, specifically mentioning Ukraine and the encroaching Russia of Vladimir Putin.
“Americans have the tendency to avert their eyes,” he said, identifying soft power as a powerful weapon in the United States’ arsenal. “Accepting our responsibilities and being engaged in war is not synonymous with launching our military at the drop of a hat. … Our leaders must become more skilled at using the full toolkit of national power.”
Gates outlined the United States’ ability to influence world affairs and cautioned against a waning dedication to global responsibility.
“For any given cause or crisis, if America does not lead, what needs to be done does not get done. So it falls to you … to pick up the mantles,” he said.
He challenged the graduates to engage in public service at some point in their lives.
“My parting question to you, as graduates, is simply whether the wise men and women of Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service will devote some of their lives to public good,” Gates said. “Dare I say, it is your duty.”
Chris Fisk (COL ’17), who attended to hear the speech and witness commencement, admired Gates’ speech.
“Dr. Gates was witty, insightful and profound. His distinguished background, buttressed by his humility and humor is really what made his address stick. He put forth a call to service that I believe many SFS graduates will accept as their duty,” Fisk said.
SFS Acting Dean James Reardon-Anderson led the commencement exercises. Reardon-Anderson, Gates, and Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., all offered prayers for Dean Emerita Carol Lancaster (SFS ’64), who is currently in hospice care after a December operation on a brain tumor. Lancaster stepped down as Dean of the School of Foreign Service in early April, after taking a leave of absence in November.

American Association for the Advancement of Science CEO Alan Leshner advised School of Nursing and Health Studies graduates to follow a non-linear career path and pursue what they love in his commencement address Saturday afternoon.
The ceremony, which began at 12 p.m., honored graduating seniors in the NHS as well as students who have earned master’s degrees in health systems administration and nursing. NHS Dean’s Medal recipient Caroline Cotto (NHS ’14) received the first degree.
“Your career path doesn’t have to be that straightforward, and it might be more interesting and gratifying if you don’t make a lifelong decision today,” Leshner said.
In his own career, Leshner has worked in academia and for the government, serving as director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and working at the National Institute of Mental Health and National Science Foundation, before joining AAAS in 2001.
University President John J. DeGioia presented Leshner with an honory Doctor of Science.
“Georgetown honors someone St. Ignatius of Loyola would have called a positive doctor,” Executive Vice President for Health Sciences and Executive Dean of the School of Medicine Howard Federoff read from Leshner’s degree citation. “We are particularly delighted to recognize him today because he has championed causes that are also core values for Georgetown.”
In his speech, Leshner discussed his own career and experience in health fields as an example of a nontraditional path.
“Receive all the advice you’re offered, do acquire mentors along the way, but always decide for yourself which advice resonates with you,” Leshner said. “When you do make a change, don’t feel you need to apologize for not taking that linear path.”
After addressing the question of what graduates want to do, Leshner moved on to discuss who each NHS graduate wants to be.
“You all entered health fields at least in part because you want to serve. That’s a great start to the question of who you want to be,” Leshner said. “The question of how well you’ve done at being who you are is much more difficult to measure, and more personal — only you can make that judgment.”
Leshner closed his lecture by addressing the “rights and responsibilities” of a Georgetown graduate.
“To me, the responsibility means use this education well for the betterment of others and yourself,” Leshner said. “I urge you to take this responsibility seriously,  to answer the question will be asked on the golf course in your ultimate retirement community — ‘So who did you use to be?’”
Attendees enjoyed Leshner’s address.
“It was an unexpectedly non-traditional speech to a seemingly traditional audience,” said Brent Nosé, whose sister graduated today.

Vatican astronomer Br. Guy Consolmagno, S.J., addressed the Georgetown College Class of 2014 in a speech this morning, focusing on the role of truth in education.
The ceremony began at 9 a.m., with many seniors arriving to line up at 7:45 a.m. shortly after wrapping last night’s Senior Ball celebrations.
Before the speech, Georgetown bestowed Consolmagno an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters.
Associate Dean of Georgetown College Helen Karn read the citation for the honorary degree.
“In recognition of a life of science that is dedicated ad maiorem Dei gloriam – ‘to the greater glory of God’ – and a life of faith that finds God in all things scientific, Georgetown University is proud to bestow upon Br. Guy Joseph Consolmagno, S.J. the degree of Doctor of Humane Letters, Honoris Causa,” she said.
After the speech, the Class of 2014 received their diplomas from Dean of Georgetown College Chester Gillis and University President John J. DeGioia. First in line were the two valedictorians of Georgetown College, Jenny Hammer and Blair Vorsatz.
Consolmagno opened his speech by explaining his role at the Vatican and the church’s role in science.
“By supporting the observatory, the church is doing more than just apologizing for Galileo. We’re reminding the world, including Catholics, that the church supports and embraces science,” he said. “We’re not afraid of the truth; we actively seek it.”
The main body of Consolmagno’s speech focused on using education in life beyond college through the metaphor of teaching extraterrestrials.
“There’s a lot of aliens out there … Is what you learn here going to cut any ice with them? Are you prepared to survive the encounter, much less, on occasion, baptize them into your way of thinking?” Consolmagno said.
He concluded that the Class of 2014 was in fact prepared because of their Georgetown educations.
“You’re ready because the things you learned here are really true,” he said. “These truths are bigger than Georgetown, bigger than planet earth, bigger than the universe.”
Consolmagno tied in the Jesuit idea of cura personalis.
“Being a person for others really works,” he said. “What you have learned here is that you never need to be afraid of the truth but you should never think that your comprehension of the truth is ever finished or ever complete.”
To close the speech, he doled out his advice to the Class of 2014.
“Go out and find those aliens, be ready to baptize them, and maybe be ready to go under a few conversions of your own. Be ready to be surprised,” he said. “Good luck. Godspeed.”
Attendees generally found him interesting and different from usual commencement speakers.
Tracey Frazier-Akparawa, an usher at the ceremony, found the speech out of character for Georgetown.
“I thought it was quite, to be sincere, a little different, a little strange,” she said. “I expected something a little different from Georgetown.”
George Spyropoulos (COL ’14) agreed but found Consolmagno refreshing.
“He was very charismatic,” he said. “He was unconventional but fresh.”
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Associate Dean of Georgetown College Sue Lorenson read the honorary degree citation for Consolmagno.
