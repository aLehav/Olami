The Muslim Law Students Association (MLSA) wrote a letter Feb. 28 to Georgetown University Law Center (GULC) administrators calling for action to address one professor’s racist and Islamophobic class conduct.  
The letter — which has garnered signatures from 286 Georgetown students, almost 30 student organizations and 24 non-GULC bar associations as of March 3 — asks for increased administrative representation and curriculum changes. The letter describes discriminatory conduct toward Muslim students by Susan Deller Ross, a tenured professor who teaches courses in international and comparative law on women’s human rights and is the director of the International Women’s Human Rights Clinic. 
The authors of the letter, which were a group of MLSA members, gathered information from decades of coursework in Ross’ classes, citing dozens of excerpts from the required textbook she authored and exam questions she wrote. The authors wrote that the content they gathered represents a holistic picture of Ross’ racist and Islamophobic beliefs. 
The letter requests that Ross’ course curriculum be modified and reviewed by a Muslim expert, according to Hamsa Fayed (LAW ’23), a member of MLSA.
“It is quite clear from our 17-page memo and content of our statement that Prof. Ross is not able to objectively evaluate any question relating to Muslims and their practice without injecting dangerously Islamophobic rhetoric into her teachings/examinations, thus we also ask that she refrain from the use of those topics in her class lectures and examinations,” Fayed wrote to The Hoya.
MLSA’s demands include mandating anti-Islamophobia and anti-discrimination specific training for all GULC faculty, reserving a seat for an MLSA representative on the committee that appoints GULC faculty, and creating a clear and direct internal system for students to anonymously file complaints for the administration to investigate.
Past coursework that MLSA marked as promoting islamophobic rhetoric included a 2020 exam that asked students to advocate for the Hindutva Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), an extremist right-wing party responsible for mass lynchings of Muslims in India and Kashmir. 
The exam question distressed and harmed many students, according to MLSA member Maheen Haq (LAW ’23).
“How do you expect someone like a Muslim person to take that exam?” Haq said in an interview with The Hoya. “Members of my family have died and you’d be expected to take this exam and advocate on behalf of a party that has done lynchings of your community.”
Ross said her coursework does not specifically target Muslim students and focuses on international and human rights law.
“My courses and casebook sections concerning discrimination against women in marriage,
divorce, and inheritance cover many statutes, whether they stem from the Catholic, Protestant, 
Mormon, Jewish, Muslim, or Hindu religion or from ethnic customs or from cultural beliefs that 
women should be subordinate to men,” Ross wrote to The Hoya. “I am not against any religion or ethnicity.”
Being forced to argue on behalf of Islamophobic laws and rules, as the letter states Ross encourages students to do in the clinic, could cause students to begin applying those ideas to their careers and lives, Haq said.  
“This will influence your policy choices, it’s going to influence how you do so many different things,” Haq said. “For example, she asked students to advocate against the right for women to wear a hijab, and she taught students how to use international doctrines and treaties to make that argument. That’s just sick.”
Fayed felt as though she had to act against her beliefs and morals in order to perform well in Ross’ clinic, according to a video posted on the GULC MLSA instagram page.
“This all really tore me apart after a while especially since a lot of those stances were fundamentally against my belief systems and my identity as a human rights advocate,” Fayed said in the video. “I was ashamed of myself, ashamed to call myself an advocate for social justice, ashamed to be a Muslim, ashamed that I wasn’t defending myself as a proud Muslim, ashamed of what I had enabled from being silent, ashamed that I feared speaking out because I was the only one in the room that felt this way, ashamed that those fellow students would invalidate me because I was a nobody in comparison to the decorated and accomplished professor Susan Ross.”  
Jinan Chehade (LAW ’23), another member of MLSA who raised concerns about Ross’ insensitive course content alongside Haq, said the administration did not provide an adequate response.
GULC prioritizes making classrooms inclusive environments with respectful dialogue, according to William Treanor, dean of GULC.
“We received the letter and have been in touch with the student leaders and individuals involved,” Treanor wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown Law is committed to ensuring an inclusive campus that welcomes students of all backgrounds.”
MLSA’s letter follows a series of student activism against racist conduct from faculty members at GULC. The GULC administration placed Ilya Shapiro, a prospective administrator, on administrative leave Jan. 31 pending investigation from the Law Center following racist and sexist tweets about President Biden’s pledge to nominate the first Black female Supreme Court justice. The decision followed a Jan. 28 statement released by the Georgetown Law Black Law Student Association (Georgetown BLSA), urging GULC to to rescind Shapiro’s job offer, commit to a more thorough hiring process, properly staff the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, ensure the representation of Black students when it comes to hiring decisions and fund an endowment to support Black GULC students. 
Professor Franz Werro referred to a student Feb. 10 using an anti-Asian slur, prompting the GULC Asian Pacific American Law Students Association (APALSA) and the Georgetown China Law Society (GCLS) to urge the GULC to hold mandatory implicit bias training for professors and to discipline staff and faculty. In March 2021, Black students and faculty at GULC demanded institutional change after a viral video captured professor Sandra Sellers making racist comments about Black students in her course.
In light of recent controversies at GULC, as well as Ross’ course and clinic, some members of MLSA ask that Islam be taught within accurate and objective contexts at GULC, according to Fayed.
“We want her course curriculums to be modified to be more sensitive to POC cultures and the Islamic faith through the use of a Muslim expert to review the curriculum,” Fayed wrote.
Haq said she ultimately decided to forfeit the opportunity to learn in a clinic she is interested in because of the racism she found in Ross’ curriculum. According to Haq, she is not the only Muslim student who was hesitant to participate in Ross’ course or clinic.  
Nearly 50% of Muslims living in the United States experienced some form of discrimination in the past year, including being treated with suspicion, called offensive names and singled out by law enforcement, according to 2017 data from the Pew Research Center. 
MLSA’s letter also demands that Ross’ grading systems change so that personal biases cannot influence student grades, according to Fayed.
“What we are asking for is simple: removing Prof. Ross from any student evaluation position where her biases and prejudices would negatively affect POC and Muslim students,” Fayed wrote. “The non-blinding grading system does not protect POC and Muslim students at all from Prof. Ross’s inherent prejudices and racism.”
Chehade said that the Islamophobic tactics Ross uses in her curriculum would result in further discrimination if left unchecked by the university.
“It really starts here in the classroom, when we continue to be silent about these blatant forms of racism, when we continue to be passive and say, ‘This is normal,’” Chehade said.

I happen to know Professor Ross and know she’s absolutely against bigotry & religious intolerance. When Trump was running for office and proposed the Muslim ban she was horrified. She’s against practices that subjugate & harm women. That’s her passion. Not hatred. The students go speak with her directly about what they see as bias, discuss how they see the issues, and both parties can try to better understand each other. It’s cruel to paint her in this light, as she’s spent her long career trying to better the lives of many people, Muslims included.

When did GU Law become such a rancid pit of hate and racism?

“Students leads charge against female professor (and director of the International Women’s Human Rights Clinic) for teaching women’s rights material” is  playing differently in the campus press than one would have imagined. 
Of course anyone who was offended by the way Professor Ross teaches her class should be heard. I hope this professor takes this feedback in good faith and reassesses whether she is presenting culturally sensitive material in a sophisticated way.
But of course, the men who run Georgetown should stand up for the right of an accomplished feminist professors to speak about women’s rights, and ignore this outrageous demand to submit her writings to the approval of religious authorities.
And, setting subjective experiences for the moment, the rest of this complaint is absurd. Any decent law student should be able to see through it.
The supposedly offensive exam questions? They’re all extremely normal legal case questions, in which students are challenged to explain how they would represent a particular client taking a particular stand on a women’s rights issue. Yes, some of these stands are controversial, like the French ban on wearing religious dress in classrooms. But don’t Georgetown Law students realize that, as aspiring lawyers, they may need to represent clients who hold controversial positions, even some they may not agree with? Don’t they understand that learning how to do that is … the point of law school? 
The answer, I think, is that they do understand, but they are trying to make mountains out of molehills to tar a professor who (understandably) rubbed them the wrong way by loudly and unapologetically standing up for women’s rights around the world. They’re entitled to their discomfort, but if they don’t recognize the regressive precedent they are trying to set, I hope Georgetown Law leadership does.

This sounds like a personal attack by Haq and Fayed. Do they really think anywhere in America that a university is going to submit a syllabus to a “Muslim expert” for review before teaching. I you think that is going to happen, then GULC or for than matter any American University is not for them. In addition to the separation of church and state there is a concept called academic freedom that allows professors to address issues that are of consequence, and that does includes religions. Religious wars have been the most heinous events in history, murdering people in untold numbers for some infraction against the belief. And its not just wars, it is the day to day religious oppression of those who choose not to comply or voice an opposition. If Haq and Fayed don’t think that is a subject they can intellectually discuss, then perhaps they either don’t have the intellectual capacity to engage in debate, or they are themselves such zealots demanding ‘their rights’ be accommodated they do not belong in the legal profession. GULC has a diversity of students wanting to become lawyers. If Haq and Fayed cannot articulate a position that shows where Ross is violating a law in her teachings, then perhaps they are not suited to the legal profession. I certainly wouldn’t want to find out a lawyer I’ve  hired to defend me would let religion or anything else stand the way of a full throated defense. 
This foolish complaint should be dismissed. And if the complainants are not satisfied, perhaps they should be as well.

No aspect of the comments in support of the professor make sense.  Here is an example of why. According to Donald Trump, those persons — especially Blacks who accused him of being a racist — were the real racists.  Those who supported him not only agreed, but also supported and defended Trump.  Who were these persons?  Many were white nationalists.
I believe the students.  First, Muslims in professional school tend to aspire to just fit in, integrate into their academic settings, and avoid virtually anything that would bring attention to them.  They usually quietly endure institutional insults and encourage other to do the same.  They endure harms. They don’t raise controversy.  Rarely will they respond with demands, sans instances when they seek to address a material harm. 
Second, the professor’s assignments are both unusual and unbalancing. A core principal of legal training is teach a student to, “argue both sides”.  This is not just the practice of law school, but also one of its mandates.  Related, for examination and papers, students are asked to weigh the merits of both side and reach a conclusion. These exercises can be fun because they stimulate debate and students’ knowledge of a subject matter. 
Never, not ever should a law professor instruct a student to argue against the religious or cultural practices of a people — especially if those persons are either Muslim or Jewish.  To do so is an abjectly racist practice.  For certain, the exercise itself is intended to cause harm.
The student’s response was moderated. They expressed their harm and, “proffered” an occasion for Susan Ross, and indeed GT Law, to make amends.  I especially applaud their efforts because, even after being harmed, they only sought that their law school fix things going forward.  
Georgetown U Law is now at a place where it can right a wrong.  It should suspend Ross from teaching.  It may seek to get her placed at a law school in Israel. There, her anti-Muslim speech and practices will be received without controversy.  Or they can encourage her affiliated research and advocacy organisations to fire her.
The law should also undergo changes in its hiring practices.  It should encourage younger Muslim lawyers to teach at the school.  This may lead to the law school fixing the racist biases threat seem to have overwhelmed its Muslim (and, likely other) student populations.  It may also result in GT law benefitting. At a minimum, its students would learn how to argue both sides.
Having evidence of Ross’ decade long patterns of harming and speaking against the cultural and religious practices of Muslims, Georgetown need only do the right thing this time around.   Have her to step down from ever teaching students again.

Ross is a bigot in many ways.  I took her clinic in 1995 before she published her book and she took her stress out on us … esp. me.  The year before she took a year to grade a paper and look up every single footnote.  I am disabled and have an invisible disability and she told me I was “faking it.”  She even shoved me in court .. I should have had her arrested.  She never finished my recommendations, then denied my entrance to a fellowship.  Ross uses feminism to advance herself only and cares nothing about individual women or students.  She’s a terror and a nightmare and it’s a shame her reign is allowed to continue.  She is, quite simply, a terrible human being.

My post was removed.  I had Deller Ross in two classes in 94 and 95 – both were still horror stories engrained on my mind, even now.  I wrote a beautiful long paper on immigration guidelines in the US based on gender persecution and Ross tried to tear it apart – after waiting to grade it for almost a year – and her incomplete – due to her inability to grade – cost me a job offer.  Then in her clinic, she drug me all year asking me to do all kinds of extra work because I was disabled – holding my grade over my head to blackmail me to do it.  She even shoved me in court, and told me my disability was something that I was “faking.”  I should have had her arrested for assault AND filed a complaint for gender/disability bias.  Don’t be fooled by her.  She uses feminism to advance her own career while she rapes the minds and spirits of students who are different than she is – and fawns over a few select favorites.  She falls back on the notion that she is “tenured.”  I am not muslim and I would characterize her as a bigot against the disabled as well as in general an intolerant person.  She is a self-aggrandizer and creates a lot of harm in her ability to broadcast her name in the supposed “help” she has done for other women.  I would guess she has done more harm than good.  I congratulate the student above for having the nerve to speak out.  Ross is a nightmare and I am sorry to hear her reign of terror continues.  She absolutely destroyed my time at Georgetown, never got my recommendations out – and then denied me a fellowship. I have gone on to practice and was even a judge, but still carry her scars.

Keep erasing – I will keep speaking.  It’s time that that her patterns be broadcast – they go BACK DECADES.  Deller Ross has no understanding or compassion outside Title VII.

The Georgetown Black Student Alliance (BSA) and the Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) hosted an event March 3 in honor of Black American cuisine. 
The event, which took place at Launch, a weekly-rotating location at the upstairs portion of Leo O’Donovan Dining Hall, featured chef Jerome Grant, the inaugural executive chef for the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC). Grant performed a culinary demonstration showcasing reinvented dishes from Hercules Posey and James Hemings, enslaved people who served as chefs to George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. 
Serving black-eyed pea fritters, crawfish macaroni and cheese and pepper pot short ribs, Grant emphasized the importance of Black cultural foods in the white-dominated field of culinary arts. 
Food has the ability to connect people from all backgrounds, according to Grant.  
“One of the most important things that I learned about food is that it’s the callus that connects all together. No matter where we’re from, no matter what culture, what background we are, we all have this thing called food that connects us. It feeds us, it nourishes us, it tells the story about who we are, our heritage and our traditions,” Grant said at the event. 
American cuisine is defined by the contributions people of color have made, according to Grant. 
“I really enjoy telling stories behind food. We’re here to talk about Hercules Posey and James Hemings, both who really started to help guide what American food is,” Grant said. “American food was built on the backs of Brown people, Latinos, Asians, many diverse people because of the migration through the transatlantic slave trade.” 
Posey, an enslaved man, was widely admired for his culinary skills and was brought to Philadelphia by Washington to cook for the presidential household. Later in his life, Posey emancipated himself and was one of few enslaved people who managed to escape enslavement from Mount Vernon, Washington’s home, during his lifetime.  
As a boy, Hemings was taken to Virginia to serve in Jefferson’s household. Later in his life he was trained as a chef in Paris and later in his life negotiated for legal manumission. 
Hercules and Hemings are critical figures in the history of American cuisine, BSA and GUSA president Nile Blass (COL ‘22) said.  
“Hercules and Hemings are very unique figures. Even in their enslavement, they became foundational to not only Black cuisine, but American cuisine in general,” Blass said. “The important thing to understand is that despite their skill, neither of these men were freed by Washington or Jefferson, they either had to run away or contractually negotiate their manumission.”
Food allows people to engage at a deeper level with Black history, according to Blass 
“When we’re talking about Black history, it’s very intangible, and it’s not really something we get to interact with, it’s something we read about. So I think through different elements, especially food, it becomes something we are actively interacting with and something that’s meaningful,” Blass said at the event. 
White people have historically left Black history out of American history by pushing sanitized, inaccurate depictions of Black people and culture. Most recently, states across the United States have attempted to block the teaching of critical race theory, with many conservatives comparing the theory to socialism or Marxism. 
People often tokenize Black chefs for their identity rather than their talent, according to Blass 
“This contemporary understanding of what it means to be Black in the cuisine field, and what it means to be loved in that superficial sense and not as a person is something that a lot of Black and Brown people still experience in the culinary field,” Blass said. 
Food provides an invaluable opportunity to connect with history, according to Grant. 
“People who put a lot of love, tradition and heritage in food, the food is always great because it always tells a story. It always brings you back to a particular time in your life or a particular time throughout your travels,” Grant said.

The African Studies Program (AfSP) in the Georgetown School of Foreign Service (SFS) hopes to expand its mission of international anti-racism through increased course offerings. 
The AfSp was founded by Dr. James Moone, a pastor and longtime member of the NAACP who marched alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s. The program, founded in 1980, was established for students to study the political, social and economic life across Africa and to foster an understanding and engagement of African history and contemporary life.
Today the program continues to value a focus on global equity, according to AfSP Director Lahra Smith. 
“For 42 years, our focus has been on educating our students in empirically-grounded and ethically-informed African Studies, and also in promoting and encouraging study in Africa,” Smith wrote to The Hoya. “Certainly, there are shifts that we take and responses we make to demands across the Continent and within the US and our University.”
Georgetown students receive holistic education in the regions they study which is reflected in the AfSP’s interdisciplinary curriculum that touches on a wide range of topics, AfSP Professor Ken Opalo said.
“Our mission is to train the whole person,” Opalo wrote to The Hoya. “That means that we will change when needed to meet emerging challenges and opportunities and to cater to our students’ changing interests, whether that is studying and teaching economic transformation in the region, US-China competition across Africa, or climate change.”
The AfSP recently received a grant from the Henry Luce Foundation to launch the Africa-China Initiative in partnership with the Asian Studies program. The grant allowed the two programs to collaborate in research, as well as hold discussions on diplomacy, trade and development between the two regions. 
Africa-China Initiative Director Dr. Yoon Jung Park said this collaboration presents the opportunity to explore African relations in the world at new depths. 
“Given the ongoing circulation of misinformation, like ‘debt trap diplomacy’, and heavily politicized narratives that demonize China and dismiss African agency, we feel it is imperative to educate our audiences with the complicated and nuanced realities of Africa-China engagements,” Park wrote in a statement from the SFS. 
The program looks to expand in the coming years through adding new professors to the program, offering new language classes and promoting a wider variety of study abroad locations, according to Smith. 
“We do have three years of Swahili taught now, so students can take it for their proficiency, but by expanding our offerings even more, both in Swahili and maybe eventually offering a second African language, that would enhance students knowledge of African studies, a Continent where there are 55 countries and close to 2000 languages spoken,” Smith wote. 
The French department is also recruiting professors who specialize in Francophone African Studies, according to Smith. 
Expanding study abroad programs beyond Tanzania, Kenya, Ghana, South Africa, Cameroon and Morocco would present students with unique research opportunities, Opalo said. 
“Africa is a continent of 55 diverse countries that present a lot of interesting learning opportunities for Georgetown University students,” Opalo wrote. “Ghana, Senegal, Zambia, Namibia, and Botswana are all interesting countries where we should be sending more Georgetown University students to study and or conduct research.” 
Despite aid from adjunct professors, more full-time core faculty members are needed to support student interest in writing theses and conducting research, Smith said. Hiring more faculty members is crucial to the expansion of the program. 
“We have other regular adjunct offerings from colleagues who work in the security sectors,” Smith wrote. “But some of these subjects, especially core history and environment courses, will require us to have full-time faculty to be effective at teaching and advising students long-term.”

The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce (CEW) published a report, which found that the value of Georgetown’s education ranks high despite public universities out ranking private schools.   
This year’s report comes after CEW’s first report in 2019 entitled “A First Try at ROI: Ranking 4,500 Colleges.” The report uses data from the College Scorecard, a database organized by the U.S. Department of Education, to calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) over several increments of time after enrollment at higher education institutions.
There are discrepancies between the return on investments for students who attended public institutions compared to private institutions, according to CEW Director of Editorial and Education Policy Martin Van Der Werf. 
“We think that that’s primarily because of the lower cost of public colleges because our formula includes how much you earn basically minus how much you paid to go to college,” Van Der Werf said in an interview with The Hoya. “The lower price tag at the front end helps returns later in life. Now cumulatively, the returns are greater for people who went to public colleges.”
Other factors influence the return on investment for students, according to Anthony Carnevale, director of CEW and lead report author.
“College typically pays off, but the return on investment varies by credential, program of study and institution. It’s important to inform people about the risk of taking out loans but not graduating, which could leave them without the increased earnings that would help them repay those loans,” Carnevale wrote in a press release.
After 40 years, four-year public institutions have returns of $1.03 million while four-year private nonprofit institutions have returns of $984,000, according to the report. 
While prospective students likely don’t consider ROI numbers as a factor in their decision-making, it is a helpful statistic for colleges to have, according to Van Der Werf.
“It’s useful for institutions to look at how they compare against peers,” Van Der Werf said. “Because you can break down the college scorecard data by major, I think it helps institutions to understand how their different majors are doing and how students who studied particular majors, how they’re doing in the workforce, comparing them against peers and how much debt students are incurring while in college.” 
While on average public institutions provide a higher ROI, Georgetown ranks high among the 4,500 colleges listed. Ten years after graduation, Georgetown ranks 346th, with an NPV of $221,000. After 40 years, Georgetown’s NPV is $2,027,000, ranking 23rd overall.
Georgetown is pleased to see the value of its education recognized in this way, according to a university spokesperson. 
“Georgetown’s values shape and mold students into the fullest version of themselves, poised to make an impact for good wherever they are during their time as students and into the future — on campus, in our DC community, in the communities they hold dear, and on the global stage,” a university spokesperson wrote to The Hoya.
Van Der Werf said that in the past he has received inquiries from people questioning whether college is worth it.
“If the people who attend them aren’t doing anywhere better than someone who went to high school, isn’t that saying that college really isn’t worth the time and money?” Van Der Werf said. “My opinion is that that’s more of an indictment of those colleges than it is of college in general as adding value to people’s lives.” 
60% percent of college graduates make more than those with only a high school diploma, 10 years post graduation. There are discrepancies among the NPV for students who attend public institutions and private institutions, and at the 10-year mark, institutions granting associate’s degrees and certificates have the largest return, according to the report.
However, the report found that at more than 30% of all colleges, more than half of students earn less than high school graduates after 10 years. This disparity could be a result of low graduation rates and differences among gender, race and ethnicity, according to a Feb. 15 McCourt School press release.
There is a difference in returns among those who attend college and those who do not, according to Van Der Werf.
“We also came up with a study last year called The College Payoff, which shows that we found that the average person with a four year degree will make 75% more during a career than the person with a high school diploma,” Van Der Werf said. “$2.8 million versus $1.6 million. That’s a huge difference.”

Students from the Georgetown University Medical Center’s (GUMC) chapter of the Student National Medical Association (SNMA), a national network of medical students of color, hosted an event series titled in celebration of Black History Month. 
The series, titled “Melanin in Medicine: Liberation Through Black Identity,” was hosted in partnership with GUMC’s Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Georgetown’s Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. “Let Freedom Ring!” initiative held throughout Black History Month. 
The series included a “Physicians in Policy” event, which gave students the opportunity to meet Black physicians, view the documentary “Black Men in White Coats” and participate in an  all-female panel discussion on “Black Educators in White Spaces.” The discussion explored the roles race, gender and environment play during clinical and nonclinical years of medical training.
While this is the seventh annual installment of “Melanin in Medicine,” this year was the first time the series lasted the entirety of Black History Month, according to Georgetown SNMA Vice President Nicole Utah (MED ’25).
“This year we wanted to do things a little bit differently, still taking the blueprint of our predecessors, but spanning it out throughout the month,” Utah said in an interview with The Hoya. “We didn’t want people to just forget about it, or just have one and leave it at that, and there were a lot of stories to be told.”
Throughout the series, Georgetown SNMA aimed to facilitate dialogue about key issues facing current and aspiring Black clinicians and highlight resources for minority students who are navigating the medical field. 
The goal of the event series was also to honor Black physicians, according to Georgetown SNMA Social Chair Christina Asare (MED ’25).  
“The reason we decided to do it all month long was just to give a chance to celebrate Black History Month, with the key theme being that representation matters,” Asare said in an interview with The Hoya. “We’re just finding ways to celebrate Black positions and just show the ways to be in different sectors of things outside of medicine while being a physician.” 
Georgetown SNMA President Kitara Smith (MED ’25) said the organization worked to connect current and aspiring medical students of color. 
“It’s mainly a networking thing as well, to see for a lot of people who are underrepresented in medicine or first generation, just providing those tools of knowing — for example, for pre-meds how to approach the medical school application, or for medical students, how to approach the residency applications, or how to network, how to kind of put yourself out there, so you can have more representation in medicine,” Smith said in an interview with The Hoya. 
SNMA provides critical support to students as they embark on their medical school endeavors, according to GUMC Dean Edward B. Healton. 
“Our SNMA students and dedicated faculty advisors enrich our community through their meaningful programming such as the recent Black History Month series, Melanin in Medicine, and by their dedication to our Medical Center’s Racial Justice Committee for Change. SNMA consistently demonstrates a deep commitment to our Georgetown values – especially cura personalis.” Healton wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Georgetown SNMA works closely with Georgetown University Minority Association of Pre-Health Students (GUMAPS), an organization at GUMC focused on increasing diversity in the medical field by supporting undergraduate students on the pre-med track and providing them with mentorship opportunities, Smith said. 
Utah said hearing about the experiences of underrepresented medical students and physicians inspired her to become involved with the Georgetown chapter once she became a medical student.
“I think it was at that moment, I got to see people who looked like me in such a space that is very limited in our representation,” Utah said. “Hearing their experiences, hearing their stories, both medical students and physicians, and to hear all of the struggles but also the empowering experiences of people who I looked up to, was just an incredible experience for me that I think that every undergrad should get the chance to do.”

Black health activism can be inclusive of disability politics, Sami Schalk, professor of Gender and Women’s Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said at a March 2 virtual event.
The event, titled “Articulating and Enacting Black Disability Politics in the National Black Women’s Health Project,” was moderated by Nadia Brown, chair of the Women’s and Gender Studies Program at Georgetown University. 
During the event, Schalk drew from her second book project, titled “Black Disability Politics,” to discuss how issues of disability have been incorporated into Black activism. 
The women’s and gender studies program, the program in disability studies, the department of African American studies and the Gender Justice Initiative hosted the virtual event. 
The National Black Women’s Health Project, a nonprofit created to advance the health and wellness of Black women and girls, is an example of an organization that enacted Black disability politics within their Black feminist health activism, Schalk said at the event.
“From its inception, the National Black Women’s Health Project promoted an intersectional and specifically Black feminist approach to addressing health disparities and health crises for Black women with an aim to improve health across Black communities in general,” Schalk said.
The National Black Women’s Health Project was founded in 1981 and became an independent nonprofit organization in 1984. The organization officially changed its name in 2002 to the Black Women’s Health Imperative.
In its early years, the project centered around self-help groups, seeing them as a means to impact Black women and Black community health at micro and macro levels, according to Schalk.
“The self-help philosophy of the National Black Women’s Health Project, which undergirded most of their work for over a decade, can be interpreted within a Black disability political framework and multiple ways,” Schalk said. “For instance, while the self-help groups were occasionally formed around specific disabilities, or diseases such as diabetes, the groups were not disability identity-based nor segregated by disability or health status.”
Another differentiating aspect of the Black Women’s Health Project from other groups was its perception of health, according to Schalk.
“The project took a holistic and broad approach to health, which included physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well-being,” Schalk said. 
The organization’s emphasis on spirituality is another example of how the project’s health activism is linked to Black disability politics, according to Schalk.
“Spirituality is not a common element of disability studies or public health work typically,” Schalk said. “Disability studies scholars have engaged with religion primarily through discussions of ableism and Christian Churches’ critiques of faith, healing and challenges to the idea that disability is either a gift or a curse from God. And yet, spirituality, faith and religion are major parts of Black culture and therefore critical to interpreting Black disability politics.”
The Black Women’s Health Project also sought to promote and create culturally-based public health initiatives, according to Schalk.
“The project was critical of public health programs developed for communities by people outside of those communities,” Schalk said. “They instead promoted and created programming which met people where they were and took the community’s own desires and needs into account.”
In an effort to raise political consciousness, the organization sought to empower people through distributing health knowledge, according to Schalk. 
“The project published vital Signs articles in 1993 and 1994 which specifically detailed how black women with HIV AIDS could qualify for Social Security disability benefits,” Schalk said. “The National Black Women’s Health Project taught Black women how to advocate for themselves and their loved ones within the medical industrial complex.”

A local Washington, D.C. park and accompanying trail no longer bear the name of a former D.C. government official who worked to disenfranchise and marginalize Black residents throughout his career. Melvin Hazen — who the park was originally named after — served as president of the District of Columbia Board of Commissioners — effectively the mayor of D.C. — from 1933 to 1941. 
During Hazen’s five decades in District government, he enacted policies displacing Black residents from neighborhoods in favor of white residents. Pressure to remove Hazen’s name from the park and trail connecting the Cleveland Park neighborhood to Rock Creek Park, began after a November 2020 Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC) 3F resolution called for Hazen’s name to be stripped from the park and trail. 
The National Park Service (NPS) removed his name on Feb. 23. The park will indefinitely be called by its official name, Reservation 630, and Hazen’s name will also be removed from the park’s trail and garden. 
Hazen aided in the displacement of Black residents from the Fort Reno Park area, according to a spokesperson from the NPS.
“Melvin Hazen was a leading force in the systematic dismantling of Reno City in Northwest Washington during the 1930s and 1940s,” the spokesperson wrote to The Hoya. “As president of the District of Columbia (DC) Board of Commissioners from 1933 to 1941, Melvin Hazen was instrumental in the displacement of Black residents from this area to create what is now Fort Reno Park.”
The removal of Hazen’s name comes alongside a greater push to rename public spaces named after racist figures in D.C. The District of Columbia Facilities and Commemorative Expressions (DCFACES) Working Group evaluated the District’s public schools, parks and government buildings in 2020 and recommended the removal of names from dozens of these spaces. 
The park, trail and garden were named after Hazen in 1942 following his death.
According to Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), who published a February 2021 press release calling for the NPS to change the name of the park, Hazen’s policies marginalized Black residents in D.C. 
“Over the 51 years of his career, he held considerable influence and power over the development of D.C., and chose to wield this power by implementing a drastic urban planning strategy in Northwest D.C. that promoted segregation, prioritized all-white communities and marginalized African-American residents,” Norton wrote in the press release. 
Policies Hazen implemented continue to influence the District today. Ward 3, where the park is located, is just 7% Black, while Black residents make up 46% of D.C.’s population.
Hazen’s actions are the antithesis of ANC 3F’s values, according to the resolution. 
“ANC 3F feels that the name Melvin Hazen does not represent the kind of community which we feel we are and for which we strive to be – a community that values inclusivity and diversity, and one that condemns racism and xenophobia,” the resolution reads.
According to the NPS spokesperson, NPS has the ability to remove the name from the park. 
“We have considered this history, as well as current law, regulation and policy that govern our actions, and we have concluded that the NPS has administrative authority to remove the name,” the spokesperson wrote.  
NPS does not have the power to rename the park after another individual or group, the spokesperson said.  
“We do not, however, have the authority to rename the park in honor of any person, group of persons, historic site or event because of restrictions laid out in the Commemorative Works Act of 1986 (CWA),” the spokesperson wrote. 
While the removal of Hazen’s name is an important step in ensuring the District’s public spaces do not memorialize racist figures, the action should have taken place earlier, according to Norton.
“Labeling the majority African-American community in Reno City a ‘blight’ that was out of ‘harmony with the general plan for the District,’ Hazen orchestrated the demolition of this neighborhood, pushing African-American families out of the homes they owned in the District,” Norton wrote. “The removal of his name from Rock Creek Park is long overdue.”

CW: This article discusses mass violence in Ukraine. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
“Slava Ukraini! Glory to Ukraine,” students cried at a demonstration outside Healy Hall in support of Ukrainians facing a Russian invasion. 
Georgetown University students, staff and community members alike donned Ukrainian flags and signs with messages of support to gather at the steps of Healy Hall and show solidarity with the people of Ukraine. The March 2 demonstration featured Ukrainian student speakers, as well as former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John E. Herbst (SFS ’74). 
Since the invasion, Inna Cherniak (SFS-Q ’23), who is from Ukraine, and her friend have shared shifts monitoring airstrikes in their hometown each night. 
“This is the reality that Ukrainians have been living in for the past six days,” Cherniak said at the demonstration. “Whenever I call my parents, they don’t know what day of the week it is, they don’t know what date it is, but they do know that it’s the sixth day since Russia invaded Ukraine.” 
Since the invasion of Ukraine more than 700 civilians have been killed and more than one million civilians have fled the country.  
Herbst said the crisis in Ukraine poses a threat to the world if it is not taken seriously. 
“What’s happening in Ukraine is both a moral outrage and a direct challenge to critical American interests,” Herbst said at the demonstration. “I hope you’re here because you support strong American Western policy to say no to Putin, because our lives are not on the line here, but our prosperity is and the world that your children will inherit is.”
The most important things people can do to help Ukraine are increasing awareness, urging their representatives to stand up for Ukraine, and donating money to Ukrainian support efforts, according to Andrii Sendziuk (MSB ’24).
“Money is really important in this situation, not only because of the contrasts between the Russian and Ukrainian armies, but also because there are so many displaced people,” Sendziuk said in an interview with The Hoya. “If anybody can donate anything, I think they definitely should and I think every single person in Ukraine would be utterly grateful for any smallest donation.” 
Many organizations have begun to raise money for Ukraine including UNICEF, which supports the safety of children and families in the country; Médecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders, which helps people travel to health care facilities; and Voices of Children, which provides psychological and psychosocial support for children who experience violent conflict. 
Since the Feb. 24 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Georgetown community has come together to express their support for Ukrainians. Beyond the demonstration, students have also taken to Red Square to raise awareness for the crisis in Ukraine. Their table displays images of the Ukrainian flag and messages like “Ukraine is not yet lost” and “Stop the war.”  
Sendziuk, who grew up in Ukraine and helped lead the tabling effort in Red Square, said their goal is to spread information about the invasion that may otherwise be inaccessible in the United States. 
“We want to make sure that people can speak to us Ukrainians and people who are directly affected,” Sendziuk told The Hoya. “We can tell them from first person what’s going on, what we are hearing from our families, what we are hearing from the Ukrainian news — information that would not be accessible in the U.S. otherwise.” 
Ukrainian American Orest Mahlay (COL ’22), who has family in Ukraine, said it is important to spread awareness of the situation in order to combat Russian disinformation. 
“One way we’re trying to reach out to students is by allowing students that don’t know much about the situation to read more about it and just kind of read and fact check information about the war,” Mahlay said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Ukrainian officials have urged American tech giants including Facebook and others to restrict Russian access to their platforms to combat Russian disinformation about the invasion. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has banned Russian state-run media from sellings advertisements on its platform and has removed some accounts spreading disinformation. 
Nicholas Frayter (MSB ’23), the founder of Georgetown Russian Association, has attended multiple anti-war demonstrations, and said he and many other Russians oppose the invasion of Ukraine.
“I think it is important to note that a lot of Russians do not want this war at all — it’s just one man that’s calling for this war,” Frayter said in an interview with The Hoya. “When you speak to people, they really want peace and don’t agree with what the government is doing.”
More than 6,000 Russian citizens have been arrested for protesting against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Ira Tiasko (SFS ’23), who is also from Ukraine, said people must remember to consider the human impact the invasion is having. 
“I’ve had a lot of professors talking about Ukraine as if it was a chess game, and it is disgusting,” Tiasko said in an interview with The Hoya. “If we start treating everything like a chess game, it’s gonna be really sad to live in the future.”
Josh Anderson (COL ’25), who has attended anti-war demonstrations, said it is important for non-Ukrainians like himself to show solidarity with the Ukrainian people.
“People like me who aren’t Ukrainian are there to show support not only in numbers, but in helping to chant, to amplify the message in person and on social media,” Anderson said in an interview with The Hoya. “If we allow this illegal invasion against Ukraine and this violation of human rights, that can just create a sort of colossal impact that escalates into other countries around the world.”
Although Ukrainians are strong, Cherniak said, they need the world’s support. 
“Ukrainian defenders are strong, but they shouldn’t do this alone,” Cherniak said. “I urge you to keep supporting Ukraine, to keep standing with Ukraine and pleading your governments and representatives to keep standing with Ukraine. Together, we will win.”

Local criminal justice advocacy groups announced the publication of a Black-led legislative agenda to address safety and equality throughout Washington, D.C. on Feb. 25.
The legislative agenda — titled Solutions for a #SafeAndFreeDC — includes 18 bills, some of which are currently under review by the D.C. Council. Groups published the report in a response to what they say is the failure of District leadership to act on policing and public safety reform demands in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. 
Community safety cannot be solved through state violence, the agenda reads, urging officials to pursue alternative solutions to ensure public safety.
“Despite being ranked one of the most progressive jurisdictions in America, the District of Columbia has one of the biggest, Blackest, and most expensive criminal legal systems anywhere,” the agenda reads. “Although huge numbers of Black people have been forced out of the city through gentrification, nearly all of the people convicted and jailed here are Black.”
D.C. Justice Lab, Harriet’s Wildest Dreams and the National Reentry Network for Returning Citizens — all local nonprofits advocating for prison reform and leading efforts against oppressive systems — led a Feb. 25 virtual press conference to announce the agenda. They were joined by 10 other organizations and another eight signatory organizations.
Bethany Young, deputy director of D.C. Justice Lab; Tony Lewis Jr., founder of DC or Nothing Inc.; and Ty Hobson-Powell, founder and director of policy at Concerned Citizens of DC led the conversation at the event, where they emphasized a sense of urgency behind the passage of the agenda given recent instances of police brutality in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.
The agenda is evidence-based and created directly in response to community needs and goals, according to Young.
“Solutions for a Safe and Free D.C. is a living document that will be updated in real time with additional signatories and council positions,” Young said at the event. “It is not a vague list of demands or recommendations. It sets forth specific legislative action that the Council can take now.”
The District assembled three working groups over the past several years to make recommendations on public safety solutions, and their work served as a framework for the legislation the agenda proposes, Young said.
When asked about a legislative timeline for the passage of the bills, Young said he hopes to see action as soon as possible.
“We want the Council to act now, or yesterday, actually,” Young said. “We’ve seen millions of dollars, thousands of hours, committed by D.C. residents and people working and who are passionate about this city, poured into making life better for all of us, and there’s been no movement.”
Powell said that the D.C. Council should pass these bills as quickly as they passed legislative measures to control the pandemic.
“What we’ve seen during this pandemic, and over the course of it, is that things can actually move very fast when they need to,” Powell said at the event. “And so, in the same sense of urgency that we’ve seen a lot of other things, we want to move for the safety and security of Washingtonians.”
The Street Vending Decriminalization Amendment Act, which would remove criminal penalties for vending without a license, and the Revised Criminal Code Act, which would comprehensively rewrite the District’s criminal offenses and penalties, were bills included in the agenda.
Bills awaiting introduction to the D.C. Council include one that would end qualified immunity for police officers and another that would ban solitary confinement and isolation in D.C. jails.
The agenda does not have one priority but rather should be viewed as a comprehensive list of action items to ensure necessary reforms relating to community safety, according to Young.
“There’s a whole system at play here, right?” Young said. “So changing one piece of it, or one piece at a time, is not going to get us where we’re trying to go and it hasn’t.”
Immediate action is necessary to ensure the safety of District residents and reform an unjust and inequitable system, Lewis said.
“Now that the wind is blowing, and it’s proverbially moving in a different direction, I feel that people are getting stage fright,” Lewis said at the event. “I think it’s time to act, it really is, because for some people in this city, it is literally life and death on multiple levels when we’re talking about the things that these bills address.”

Georgetown University undergraduate students in Georgetown College can study the intersection of technology and ethics in society through new major, minor and concentration programs launching this fall.
Beginning in fall 2022, undergraduate students will have the opportunity to major in Computer Science, Ethics, & Society and minor in Interdisciplinary Studies in Tech, Ethics, & Society. Developed as a result of the Georgetown Tech & Society Initiative’s endeavors, the programs mark the start of at an undergraduate level. Founded in 2019, the Tech & Society Initiative connects students, fellows and professors to collaborate on projects and coursework that re-imagines ethics and policy in the digital age. 
The new programs will present students invaluable opportunities, according to Meg Leta Jones, who represents the Communication, Culture, & Society program on the Tech & Society steering committee and who helped design the new undergraduate programs. 
“The new program includes a major and concentration in Computer Science, Ethics, & Society that will provide a new path for Georgetown students who want to be a different breed of computer scientist and a minor in Tech, Ethics, & Society that provides any Georgetown undergraduate student the opportunity to pursue highly interdisciplinary unique contributions to the issues they find most interesting and pressing,” Jones wrote to The Hoya. 
Students who major or minor in these new programs can use the skills they learn to become anything from journalists, activists, corporate designers and policy professionals, Jones said. 
Jones said the creation of the new majors came in part from student demand.
“We see a lot of enthusiasm from students looking for more courses and opportunities in tech policy and ethics, design justice, algorithmic bias, misinformation, AI governance, block chain policy, internet history, privacy, data protection, surveillance capitalism, platform regulation, etc,” Jones said. 
Increased conversations regarding technology and ethical practices on campus indicated to the program designers that there was a demand for classes in the field, according to Carly Comparato (COL ’22), an Ethics Lab student fellow. 
“They’ve been asking us questions about how students find out about new majors, what information would be crucial to people considering this course, how it should be presented, how the word spreads,” Comparato said in an interview with The Hoya. 
The Ethics Lab, a team of Georgetown philosophers and designers, focuses on ways to ethically tackle global technology issues, according to Comparato. 
Combining ethics and technology is crucial in the development of technology, according to Jason Farr, a postdoctoral fellow in the department of philosophy who is teaching a course on ethical issues in tech and society this semester.
“We want to make sure that the next designers and developers of tech, the next policy makers and regulators lawyers and advocates, and the next generation of tech users can develop an ethical orientation and toolkit that will enable them to meet some of the biggest challenges of our lifetimes, and meet them responsibly,” Farr wrote to The Hoya. 
Farr’s Tech, Ethics, and Society course is an introductory class in the three new programs, according to Farr. 
The new programs will allow students from different academic backgrounds to explore issues in tech, according to Ethics Lab Founder and philosophy Professor Maggie Little. 
“Part of what makes these programs unique is that the new Major and Minor will have integrative aspects — where students from Computer Science and students from the humanities get to jointly explore key issues in responsible tech,” Little wrote in a statement to The Hoya. 
The Ethics Lab is currently holding discussions to determine how students and parents want to participate in the new program, according to a university spokesperson. 
“Ethics Lab is holding separate discussions with current students, current parents and alumni practitioners in technology development and policy fields to hear how they might want to participate in the undergraduate program. The program aspires to host discussions and connect students with networking and internship opportunities,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya 
Rosy Arora (COL ’25), who applied for the Ethics Lab student fellowship, said incorporating ethical practices into education is essential to changing the perspective of the field at large. 
“I think we can always be better people. In the age of technology, it’s easy for people to take advantage of technology and how widespread it is, how many people it affects,” Arora said in an interview with The Hoya. 
According to Arora, it is important to consider ethics throughout one’s career. 
“I guess as we get older it’s important to keep in mind that you have to be asking ethical questions when you’re considering decisions,” Arora said.

Restaurants across Washington, D.C. are finding ways to support Ukraine through events, special food items with the proceeds going to aid Ukrainians and donations. 
The efforts to provide relief to Ukrainians come after Russia invaded the country on Feb. 24, which led to a humanitarian crisis and more than 500,000 refugees fleeing the country. Since the Russian invasion, international organizations have provided aid to the people of Ukraine and refugees to ensure their safety. 
District restaurants joined in these efforts, with many offering special promotions with the goal of donating the profits.
il Canale, a popular Italian restaurant in the Georgetown neighborhood, will donate 10% of its proceeds toward medical aid and humanitarian relief for the front lines in Ukraine. 
The restaurant hopes to provide a way for its staff and guests to raise funds in support of Ukraine in their day-to-day lives, according to il Canale’s General Manager Alessandro Farruggio.
“I saw many people who wanted to do something but were unsure how or were caught in their work that they were unable to put the time aside to see what they can do,” Farruggio wrote to The Hoya. “I wanted to give everybody an opportunity to participate in supporting Ukraine.”
Farruggio hopes that il Canale can raise awareness about the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine throughout the Georgetown community.
“Il Canale is very thankful for the support we get from the community and this city so we only feel it is right to turn that support into something that can help many people,” Farruggio wrote. “We hope that guests will become more aware of what is happening in Ukraine and share with others to look for other ways to help.”
sPACYcLOUd, a vegan Eastern European restaurant and lounge in Adams Morgan, celebrated Maslenitsa, a Ukrainian religious and folk holiday, with traditional Ukrainian food and live music March 2 as a fundraiser for Ukrainian relief efforts and to show solidarity with Ukraine, according to Founder Tati Kolina.
“I am half Ukrainian and half Russian. I lived in Ukraine and have many Ukrainian frields in USA and Ukraine,” Kolina wrote. “I am against war and I want to express condemnation of what Putin and his government are doing in Ukraine. I want to show support and solidarity to my brothers and sisters of Ukraine.”
sPACYcLOUd will also host an International Women’s Day fundraiser for Ukraine on March 8, where 50% of proceeds from ticket sales will support Ukrainian women. 
Elli Benchimol, the owner of Georgetown’s champagne and caviar bar, Apéro, has vowed to no longer purchase Russian products, and is planning to organize a fundraiser in support of Ukraine to sell the Russian vodka that is still in stock. 
Apéro is offering Russian vodka martinis and a Ukrainian cocktail, and the proceeds from the drinks will go to José Andrés, chef and founder of World Central Kitchen, a nonprofit that provides meals to people facing humanitarian crises. Andrés has been at the Ukrainian border providing meals to refugees fleeing Ukraine.
Ivy & Coney, a bar located in the Shaw neighborhood, converted its annual Fat Tuesday celebration into a fundraiser for HIAS, a Jewish nonprofit that has a team on the ground in Poland to assist Ukrainian refugees, according to Co-Owner Chris Powers.
“We are outraged and saddened by the unnecessary loss of life in Ukraine,” Powers wrote. “Fat Tuesday for us is a celebration of polish culinary traditions and based on that connection we wanted to support their efforts to welcome refugees from Ukraine.”

Georgetown University Law Center (GULC) community members filed an amicus curiae brief,  which allows experts not involved in the case to provide information to the court, on an environment-related Supreme Court case.
The Supreme Court will decide in the case West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) whether Congress can authorize the EPA to issue significant rules without limits on what the agency can require. The case will determine if the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions as long as it considers cost, non-air impacts and energy requirements.  
Sara Colangelo (LAW ’07), director of GULC’s Environmental Law and Justice Clinic and a visiting professor at GULC, and Jack Whiteley, supervising attorney and teaching fellow at the clinic, wrote the brief, which conveyed that the EPA’s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants is critical to mitigate the scale of health effects of climate pollutants. 
The case’s oral arguments, which were heard Feb. 28, consisted of discussions about how much authority Congress should have in the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions by power plants, which constitute almost 33% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions.  
The brief included public health data to provide scientific background on the harmful effects of climate change, according to Colangelo.
“This brief was intended to represent the collective wisdom of the nation’s leading medical professionals on the public health effects from climate change,” Colangelo wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our goal was to educate the Court on the practical consequences of its decision using unassailable scientific information.”
The signatories on the clinic’s brief are concerned about the limitations this case could bring on the EPA’s regulatory abilities, according to Whiteley.
“The petitioners’ arguments are intended to make it more difficult for the EPA to regulate carbon emissions in the future,” Whiteley wrote. “The amici on our brief are alarmed by this prospect.”
By explaining data regarding heat-related illnesses, fire season lengths and degraded water quality, the brief shows how these factors contribute to declining public health in the United States.  
The brief noted the important connection between health and climate change in the case, according to Lisa Heinzerling, a professor at GULC who teaches classes in environmental law and advocacy.
“The Environmental Law and Justice clinic’s amicus brief reminded us all of what will be at stake, in terms of human life and health, when the justices retire to their chambers to consider EPA’s authority to address climate change under the Clean Air Act,” Heinzerling wrote in an email to The Hoya.
This brief highlighted the importance of the impact of EPA’s regulatory role on the climate, according to Colangelo.
“We also wanted to convey that the EPA’s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants is critical to mitigate the scale of health effects of climate pollutants,” Colangelo wrote. “We urged the Court to be mindful of Congress’s decision to provide EPA regulatory authority to address this type of threat to public health.”
The Environmental Law and Justice Clinic became involved in writing the brief as a result of the influence of the American Thoracic Society (ATS), an organization that advances respiratory health through research, education and advocacy. The ATS garnered support from 16 other medical organizations and 40 public health schools, all of whom signed onto the clinic’s brief, according to Colangelo.
Despite the brief, the court will hear the merits of the case and make a decision that will influence the EPA, according to Colangelo.
The clinic’s work represents GULC’s involvement in  Supreme Court decisions, according to William Treanor, dean of GULC.
“Because of our proximity both to the Supreme Court and to the many national organizations that have interests in the Court’s litigation, our law school is a significant voice in the Supreme Court on a wide range of issues,” Treanor wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Treanor said he is supportive of the clinic’s work on environmental issues.
“I am incredibly proud of the important work the clinic did in this case, and of the role that Georgetown plays in advocating on critical issues like climate change,” Treanor wrote.

The first cohort of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Student Ambassadors aims to make the Walsh School of Foreign Service (SFS) a more equitable space through advocacy and student recruitment. 
The cohort, which was created in the fall semester and is creating new initiatives this semester, works in collaboration with SFS Vice Dean for DEI Scott Taylor to recruit prospective students from diverse backgrounds, specifically focusing on applicants of color and low-income applicants. The ambassadors also serve as mentors for first-year students from underrepresented backgrounds currently enrolled in the SFS. 
Adrian Ali-Caccamo (SFS ’24), sophomore representative on the SFS Academic Council and a student ambassador from St. Paul, Minn. said applying to Georgetown University is often inaccessible to minority students.  
“When I came to Georgetown, nobody at my high school really knew about Georgetown, nobody at my high school had come to Georgetown,” Ali-Caccamo said in an interview with The Hoya.  “I think that it’s part of a deeper, systemic problem about who has the ability and access to come to an institution like Georgetown.”
Aryaman Sharma (SFS ’24) applied to be a student ambassador last semester to allow students to voice their concerns and feel included in the SFS community. 
“As an Asian American, I do think that it’s kind of my role, I have the power to do these things. When an opportunity like this comes up, I feel obligated to represent my community and my experiences in the past because I know many of them are not just unique to me,” Sharma said. 
Clare Mullholand (SFS ‘24), a student ambassador, said Georgetown restricts the diversity of its undergraduate students through dated admissions practices, such as not accepting the Common Application, an undergraduate college application that more than 900 colleges and universities accept. 
“I’m hoping that Georgetown sits back and realizes that whatever superiority complex we have because we’re Georgetown isn’t worth it anymore,” Mullholand said in an interview with The Hoya. “Every other prestigious institution on the east coast is using the Common App, and it has not affected their reputation.”
Currently, the student ambassadors engage with underrepresented students by calling admitted applicants and delivering information sessions about Georgetown admissions to schools with large minority communities that Georgetown does not usually visit.
Dean Taylor said that the outreach work of the student ambassadors is crucial for increasing all types of diversity in the SFS.
“We want to improve the school, we want to prepare students, whatever their backgrounds, to go forth into the world and exist in a diverse world and diverse spaces and be leaders and be successful, and be able to lead in those spaces and interact with people different from themselves,” Taylor said. 
One of the main goals of the student ambassadors is to ensure that every student who wants to apply to the SFS receives guidance, Sharma said. 
“We have this initiative in trying to make the SFS more accessible to various parts of the U.S.,” Sharma said. “In underrepresented areas, where some schools don’t really receive information about Georgetown, we’ve reached out to them to host Zoom webinars, so we can make it more accessible, and so they can learn more about what Georgetown has to offer them.” 
This year, Mulholland said that student ambassadors partnered with the Georgetown Admissions Ambassadors Program (GAAP) to create immersive programming for newly accepted minority students. 
“We are assembling a marketing team and an operations team to do events for admitted students, really making the ambassador role about planning, executing and engaging with the people that come to those events,” Mulholland said.
In addition to advocating for changes to the admissions process at Georgetown, the DEI ambassador program is also working to develop a curriculum that includes a broader variety of perspectives. Student ambassadors will lead tours around campus that focus on Georgetown’s history with slavery including the descendants of the GU272, the 314 enslaved people sold by the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus in 1838 to financially sustain the school. 
Increasing diversity at the SFS will not only benefit minority students, but the institution as a whole, Ali-Caccamo said. 
“Who are the students who could really do well here and have never had the opportunity, have never heard about the Georgetown name, have never had somebody reach out to them and give them the necessary information? How do we envelop those students and give them the opportunity to be here, too?” Ali-Caccamo said. “I think we will all learn better and be better citizens of the world if our experience and our exposure more broadly reflects the world as it is.”

Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business (MSB) published its 2021 Undergraduate Employment Report, featuring the school’s highest post-graduation salaries ever achieved in the history of the program.
The annual report highlighted that 98% of MSB students who were seeking employment received a job offer within three months of graduation, with average starting salaries reaching $85,213, a  9% increase compared to the previous year.
The MSB’s comprehensive curriculum and support for students increase their post-graduate career preparation, according to Talia Schatz, assistant dean at the Undergraduate Career Development Center (UCDC) .
“Of course, trends in the economy play a role in salary data, but I think the most important factor is the fully immersive experience we offer our undergraduate students at McDonough,” Schatz wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our students are well equipped with the business acumen and professional readiness that is necessary to compete for top employment opportunities.”
The MSB’s community of faculty, staff, alumni and the UCDC care about the personal and professional success of each student, according to Paul Almeida, dean of the MSB.
“This personalized attention ensures our students pursue careers that not only give them excellent outcomes, but also provide a sense of fulfillment, purpose, and greater job satisfaction,” Almeida wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This is an important differentiator for our Undergraduate Program, and the Undergraduate Employment Report is indicative of the great results we receive through this approach.”
The opportunity to talk with recent graduates who went through the process of searching for jobs and internships provided helpful guidance for securing job offers, according to Bayley Wivell (MSB ’22).
“I felt like in the MSB it was easier to connect with peer advisors who had gone through the same process of recruiting that’s a little bit more rigid and structured than a lot of other careers and industries,” Wivell said in an interview with The Hoya.
Most consulting interviews typically consist of behavior tests, which analyze one’s personal background, and a case study, which measures one’s ability to deal with hypothetical examples. 
Practicing with alumni gave perspective to the preparation process, according to Ananya Chowla (MSB ’22).
“Learning how to do the case interview and practicing with case interviews was a big part of my prep,” Chowla said in an interview with The Hoya. “Because of the alumni network in MSB, when I was a freshman and sophomore working at different consulting firms, I was able to reach out to them and to do practice cases, which were super helpful to get their input as I want to talk through the process.”
The MSB’s support of pre-professional clubs also gives students hands-on experience related to the career they are interested in pursuing, according to Chowla.
“The fact that the MSB encourages such great student organizations to be able to run, I think it’s part of the reason student body can be so prepared to be professionally, because they’re able to get that hands on experience working with a client and doing consulting projects, as well as the network of people in the club who have gone through the process before and can give advice and tips,” Chowla said.
Career readiness is a quality that MSB instills in its students, which is what allows them to successfully enter job negotiations about the skills they possess, according to Schatz.
“They also know their worth and are skilled negotiators — we ensure they have the tools to negotiate salaries, benefits, and other work related opportunities,” Schatz wrote. “These hiring exercises help students identify and accept opportunities that reflect the value they will bring to any organization.”
MSB support systems are designed to be personalized for each student’s own undergraduate experience, according to Almeida.
“Career exploration is a very personal journey, which is why Georgetown McDonough is committed to providing tailored guidance and mentorship for students throughout their undergraduate program,” Almeida wrote.
The program’s success is best measured by student experiences, according to Schatz.
“There is only so much that statistics and lists can tell you — the true success of our employment efforts are measured through the nuanced and unique experiences of each individual undergraduate student,” Schatz wrote.

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) commission tasked with investigating the Wolfe-Ume administration’s alleged campaign violations recommended against impeachment in a Feb. 27 meeting. 
After hours of deliberation in a Feb. 13 meeting, the GUSA Election Commission (EC) recommended against certifying the election results that declared Kole Wolfe (SFS ’24) and Zeke Ume-Ukeje (COL ’24) to be the next GUSA executive president and vice president, citing allegations that the Wolfe-Ume campaign bribed students for their votes in exchange for alcohol. The Election Commission issued a formal warning to the campaign and cut the then-candidates’ speaking time at the town halls as a result of their alleged rule violations. Despite the allegations, the GUSA Senate certified the election results. 
[Full Disclosure: Wolfe is a former Hoya staffer.]
The investigative commission spent two weeks examining the allegations before ultimately deciding against impeachment as a result of a lack of clear evidence.
Dominic Gordon (SFS ’24), chair of the GUSA Ethics and Oversight Committee, said that the investigative commission took the inquiry seriously but could not definitively confirm the allegations.
“We tried our very best to look at all angles,” Gordon wrote. “I personally spent 20-30 hours on it. We just couldn’t find anything conclusive one way or another.”
Wolfe said he was pleased with the outcome of the investigative commission’s efforts and is excited to work toward the goals that Wolfe and Ume-Ukeje campaign promised during the campaign. 
“It would have been unfortunate if the results of a valid election were nullified due to baseless allegations submitted by our direct competitors,” Wolfe wrote. “While we regret the way in which some of our supporters expressed enthusiasm towards our campaign, we would like to once again reiterate that we were not personally responsible for or affiliated with their actions. We are looking forward to serving the student body to the best of our abilities.”
According to their report, the investigative commission focused on two allegations: an incident at a club in Dupont Circle and the alleged tampering with the election results through bribing.
The Election Commission accused Wolfe and Ume-Ukeje of placing a bottle of alcohol in front of their campaign sign that cost over 300 dollars at a nightclub, which violates the alcohol and campaign finance rules for GUSA elections. 
Regarding the alcohol and finance allegations, the investigative commission found that the Election Commision appropriately handled the claims.
“Further inquiry into this incident has proved inconclusive, as no witnesses have publicly come forward to provide evidence,” the report reads. “Though we received anonymous reports that presented some concern, we lacked complete verification of their claims.”
The investigative commission specifically focused on whether the events at the club were in any way endorsed by or connected to the Wolfe-Ume campaign, Gordon said.
“The questions are specifically about what constitutes a campaign staffer and how much the allegations can be tied directly to the campaign,” Gordon wrote. 
The second concern, regarding bribing students with alcohol in exchange for votes, also could not be confirmed. 
“The allegations were of the utmost gravity and the fact that they were presented to the Senate without any substantive evidence, apart from anonymous emails and the claims of an opposing campaign, we determined did not merit additional punishment without substance,” the report reads.
The investigative commission stated that the Election Commission’s action to not recommend the certification of the election results was inconsistent with GUSA bylaws, according to the report. 
However, the commission’s inconclusive finding does not entirely exonerate the Wolfe-Ume campaign’s actions following the election, including instances of harmful rhetoric, according to GUSA Senate Speaker Leo Rassieur (COL ’23). 
“As someone who had to preside over the Senate during the confirmation of the election results, I felt really frustrated with their behavior or their inaction in bringing in so many people and then allowing them to just say offensive things that are really targeted towards minority groups on campus,” Rassieur said in an interview with The Hoya. “Things like ‘Lock him up’ and ‘This is why the libs are so bad,’ are really targeted politically but also much along racial lines and class lines.”
Moving forward, Gordon said that GUSA needs to clarify their guidelines regarding campaign rules and bylaws.
“They need to have a clearer definition of campaign finance rules in the future, because the issue is that it’s really hard to define where exactly a violation occurs,” Gordon wrote. “There needs to be stricter guidelines on it, which would make this clearer where this would fall.”

Georgetown Muslim Life collaborated with America’s Islamic Heritage Museum to display an art exhibit depicting the historical impact of Muslims in the United States. 
The exhibit, titled “Forgotten Roots: The History of Muslims in America,” featured images of Muslim scientists, musicians, military service members and law enforcement agents. The display, which specifically focused on Black Muslims, was in the Healy Hall foyer from Feb. 22 to 25. 
Imam Yahya Hendi, the Muslim chaplain at Georgetown University, said the exhibit demonstrates the history of Muslims, particularly throughout North America.
“It had images of writings and other things Muslims did back in the 16th century, 17th century, 18th century, 19th century and 20th century, so we had images of Muslims throughout America,” Hendi said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Fardusi Uddin (SFS ’22), the Alumni Relations and Outreach fellow for Muslim Life and vice president of the Muslim Student Association (MSA), said the images at the exhibit illuminated her understanding of the presence of Muslims in the United States. 
“It was really interesting to see Muslims who were fighting in the Civil War, Muslim Africans who were bankers,” Uddin said in an interview with The Hoya. “It was just really interesting to see how long of a presence they’ve had in America.”
Doha Maaty (NHS ’23), MSA president, visited the exhibit Feb. 22 and noted that Muslim history often does not receive the attention it should. 
“I don’t think I realized how substantial the number of slaves that were Muslim that were being brought to America were and how that really did shape the United States and how we see things today,” Maaty said in an interview with The Hoya. “Unfortunately, it’s not given enough of a spotlight.”
Hendi said he hoped the exhibit helped students understand the extent to which Muslim history intertwines with U.S. history.
“I wanted people to know that American Muslims are not newcomers to America, and that American Muslims have been and continue to be a part of the fabric of the United States of America,” Hendi said. “In being honest with that tradition, that culture and that segment of our country and our population, we will be honest to who we are as a country.” 
Planning for the exhibit began after winter break, and Muslim Life chose to place the exhibit in Healy to increase accessibility, according to Uddin. 
“We wanted the artifacts, the showcases, the exhibit to be somewhere that is accessible not just to Muslims, but to everyone in the community,” Uddin said in an interview with The Hoya. “We were mindful as to how to showcase this Muslim African history to non-Muslims as well by putting the exhibit in the Healy foyer.”
This was the first time that the exhibit was showcased on campus since 2017, and although it may return in the future, Muslim Life does not plan on making the display annual, Uddin said. 
“It might be something that might come up again after another three or four years so a new batch of students are able to see the exhibit,” Uddin said. “We want to be able to bring in new speakers, new features and new things to the current class — we’re very cognizant about making sure the events we have are quality events, but events that are new and interesting.”
Hendi said that the goal of the exhibit was to bring people of all backgrounds together.
“My hope was that people would learn how to celebrate diversity here on campus and across the country,” Hendi said. “I wanted to also educate Muslims about their roots in America to hold themselves high and be proud of who they are.”

The Georgetown University Art Galleries, which opened to the public Feb. 3,  are featuring two new exhibitions.
The new exhibits, titled “Rotimi Fani-Kayode (1955-1989)” and “One Nation Underground: Punk Visual Culture 1976-1985,” sit in separate gallery rooms in the Walsh Building, located just one block from Georgetown’s main campus. The showcases focus on art produced in the 1970s and 1980s.   
“Rotimi Fani-Kayode (1955-1989) is the first solo exhibition from artist Rotimi Fani-Kayode (CAS ’80), a Georgetown graduate whose career lasted six years before his premature death in 1989 during the peak of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, according to a Feb. 3 gallery press release. The exhibit will be on display until April 3. 
Fani-Kayode’s work is a form of intersectional cultural expression, according to Ian Bourland, professor in the art department and curator of the exhibition.
“As a Black, queer artist working during a time of profound marginilization for such subjects in daily life and the art world, it is important that we bear witness to his art, even though it was not given due attention during his life,” Bourland wrote to The Hoya. “But it’s also important now, as we stay engaged with the ongoing reckoning with racism in American and the UK, and attend to GU’s own legacy.”  
Much of Fani-Kayode’s work is inspired from Yoruba religion, classical mythology and city subculture, the blending of which engages audiences on a new level, according to Bourland. 
“I think that connecting his work with the punk show also highlights the ways in which different countercultures converged in the US and UK, where you had dub, house, neo-romantic, and punk cultures coming together to protest racism, Apartheid, and other social issues of the day,” Bourland wrote. “It was a complex sonic and visual ecosystem, and one that was very important in mobilizing young people.”
“One Nation Underground” includes posters, flyers, pins and graphics that engage Washington, D.C. with music, art and politics. The exhibition will be on display until May 1. 
The “One Nation Underground” exhibition is smaller and emphasizes visual culture from the D.C. region and beyond, according to Bourland.
“GU as a school, and the neighborhood more broadly, were part of a vibrant punk scene that was nationally influential,” Bourland wrote. “This show calls attention to this earlier moment, and also celebrates visual culture, like posters, buttons, and flyers, as an important form of countercultural expression and protest.”
 “Rotimi Fani-Kayode (1955-1989)” is in the Maria & Alberto de la Cruz Art Gallery and “One Nation Underground” is in the Lucille M. and Richard F. X. Spagnuolo Art Gallery, both of which are in the Georgetown University Art Galleries, according to Margaret Rand (COL ’23), an intern at the gallery.
The de la Cruz Gallery opened its doors to visitors in 2018, and the Spagnuolo Gallery was established in 2003. 
These new exhibitions are on display in addition to the works of Toni-Lee Sangastiano, a professor who teaches Intro to Graphic Design, which has been housed in the de la Cruz gallery since Aug. 25 and will be showcased until May 23. 
Audiences will have an opportunity to connect with these exhibitions through upcoming public programs, according to Emma McMorran (GRD ’22), an intern at the gallery. 
“We’re planning to have a student-led tour of the Rotimi Fani-Kayode exhibition on March 25th at noon,” McMorran wrote to The Hoya. “There will also be a lecture with Prof. Ian Bourland on March 31st at 6 pm. We always love seeing students in the Galleries, and we hope that students will join us for events this semester.”

Washington, D.C. officials and ​​Universal Health Services started construction Feb. 17 on the Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center in Ward 8, which is set to become the first trauma center east of the Anacostia River.
The $375 million, 136-bed full-service hospital will open in 2024 and expects to house clinics, an ambulatory pavilion, community spaces, a 500-car garage and an emergency transport helipad. The new hospital will replace United Medical Center (UMC), which is located almost one mile away from the new hospital site and is currently struggling with staffing shortages and financial issues. However, UMC will stay open until Cedar Hill Regional Medical center opens.
The new hospital will provide long-awaited care for residents in Wards 7 and 8, according to Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) in a Feb. 17 press release.
“This is the start of a new chapter for health care in Washington, DC, especially for our neighborhoods east of the river,” Bowser said in the press release. “And I hope the message we’re sending is loud and clear: while DC Government is rightfully getting out of the business of running a hospital, we are fully present at St. Elizabeths East and fully committed to all the Washingtonians who will come to the Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center GW Health to get world-class care.”
Ward 8 hospitals currently lack a trauma center, so residents must seek care in other wards for trauma-related injuries like gunshot and stab wounds. 
Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center will help rectify many health care equity issues in the District, according to Susan Griffiths, director of communications and business development at the George Washington University Hospital.
“The development of this integrated, academic medical network will bring vital health services East of the Anacostia River where previously many lacked access to healthcare,” Griffiths wrote to The Hoya. “As such, the development will help to improve health access, equity and outcomes. This will be the first new hospital built in the District since GW Hospital was built more than 20 years ago.”
In addition to the hospital, the District is set to open two new urgent care centers east of the Anacostia River, according to Griffiths.
“This new acute care hospital – Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center, GW Health – is part of a comprehensive development that also includes two new urgent care centers in Wards 7 and 8,” Griffiths wrote. 
Physicians and medical faculty from George Washington University will staff the new hospital, while Children’s National, a pediatric hospital in D.C., is expected to operate the new neonatal intensive care unit and pediatric emergency departments. In addition to the new pediatric departments, the hospital will have women’s health, behavioral health, outpatient, specialty and mental health services. 
The hospital will be named in honor of abolitionist Frederick Douglass’ historic residence in Anacostia, with the hospital’s name serving as an important reminder of Douglass’ work, according to Bowser.
“We are not just honoring one person. We are honoring all the people who fought to preserve his legacy and tell his story,” Bowser said during the construction unveiling Feb. 17. “We are honoring the family and generations of women — Black women in particular — who persisted, persevered and eventually succeeded in preserving the Douglass family home.”
The hospital not only serves as a source of health care, but also provides equal rights for Ward 8 residents, according to Ward 8 Councilmember Trayon White in a Feb. 17 press release from the mayor’s office.
“Health equity and access to care are fundamental human rights,” White wrote in the press release. “Residents must have access to the health services they need, when and where they need them. The new full-service hospital east of the Anacostia brings us a step closer to providing equitable health care access to all Washingtonians, especially residents in Wards 7 & 8.”
