Students, faculty and staff gathered in Healy Circle Friday for a prayer vigil held for the victims of the devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake that struck Haiti Tuesday.
The earthquake destroyed the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince and affected millions, including members of the Georgetown community.
Co-sponsored by Campus Ministry and the Caribbean Culture Circle, the vigil drew approximately 80 people.
“We offer our deepest sympathies, as none of us can ever comprehend the magnitude of this tragedy . Even as our hearts have reached out, let us give all that we can. Let us in this moment answer the call to be women and men for others,” University President John J. DeGioia said.
Anthony Peña (SFS ’10), president of the Caribbean Culture Circle, addressed the attendees and spoke on the power of prayer in times of crisis.
Following Peña’s speech, the Georgetown Gospel Choir sang a rendition of “Fix Me,” a traditional spiritual hymn. Members of different faiths, including Harold White, Jewish chaplaincy director, and Yahya Hendi, Muslim chaplaincy director, read prayers and passages from sacred texts.
arta Rifin (COL ’10) spoke on the importance of student unity in a time of disaster and sang the national anthem of Haiti in Creole, moving some members of the audience to tears.
“I thank everyone for being out here in the cold and showing their love. I am Haitian, and this tragedy is more than just a national headline. It’s my nation . I’m so blessed to see you all here. It means a lot,” Rifin said.
embers of the community reaffirmed that the campus needs to be unified in the face of the devastation in Haiti.
“I think it’s really important for all the groups on campus to gather together and send our thoughts and prayers to Haiti,” Danny Gustafson (COL ’11) said.
“It was a beautiful service, and I appreciate all the people that came out to do something collective and send out a prayer,” said Ta Jane’ Perry (MSB ’13), member of the Georgetown Gospel Choir.
“We are all in this together. We are a community, as Fr. [Kevin] O’Brien [S.J.] said. If we stick together we will survive,” said Carlos Casseus, Haitian and a technology engineer with GoCard services.
Peña also added that “I’m really proud that people come out. We came together unified in solidarity. I greatly appreciate the university response. However, I hope that we will not forget about this tragedy two weeks later.”

The D.C. Metro area’s unemployment rate fell to 6.1 percent in November, according to data released last week by the U.S. Department of Labor, after a continuous rise that lasted four months.
In the District proper, the 11.8 percent unemployment rate is one of the highest in the country, compared to a 10 percent national rate.
It cannot be concluded whether or not the decrease in the D.C. Metro area’s unemployment rate will continue, partly because of month-to-month fluctuations in the rate, according to Harry Holzer, a labor economist and public policy professor at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute who served as chief economist for the U.S. Department of Labor under President Clinton. The recent decrease from 11.9 percent to 11.8 percent could be a result of low morale among those whose job searches have proven unsuccessful.
“Nationally, we are seeing lots of people drop out of the labor market, which tends to artificially reduce the unemployment rate over time,” Holzer said.
D.C. employment numbers are skewed in relation to the rest of the country. There is a poorer and higher minority population in D.C., so its unemployment rate tends to be steeper than the nation’s. The District’s positioning as the U.S. capital also influences employment differently, according to Holzer.
The federal government’s current expansion could continue to have a positive effect on employment in the District, Holzer said.
“Employment is less sensitive to the business cycle, because so much of it is in government,” he said.
At the national level, the unemployment rate dropped to 10 percent in December. While there has not been a significant level of employment growth in the United States, there has been an increase in gross domestic product, Holzer said.
According to the Executive Office of the President’s Council on Economic Advisers’ second quarterly report, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Congress’s economic stimulus package, helped to decrease the national unemployment rate.
It remains to be seen how firms will adapt in the long run to the current economic climate.
“Employers are thinking twice about taking on more workers since they’ve managed to raise productivity and output while employing fewer people,” said Holzer and Robert Lerman in an op-ed published last November in the Cleveland Plain Dealer.
Five states – California, Michigan, Nevada, Rhode Island and South Carolina – have higher rates of unemployment than the District’s unemployment rate. “

As students return to the Georgetown campus for the spring semester, they will be forced to search for an extra nickel at the cash register to accommodate a new tax on disposable bags in the District.
On Jan. 1, Washington, D.C., became the first major U.S. city to impose a fee on disposable plastic and paper bags. Customers of grocery, liquor and retail stores are required to pay 5 cents for each disposable bag they use to carry purchases.
The fee has already begun to dissuade some student consumers on Georgetown’s campus from storing their purchases in bags provided by retailers.
“When students hear about the 5-cents fee for the disposable bag, they refuse to get bags regardless of how much stuff they purchased from the store,” said Kaitlyn Frederick (NHS ’11), an employee of Vital Vittles, which, along with all other Corp services and businesses on campus such as the Georgetown University Bookstore, is subject to the new tax.
Sam Fubara (COL’ 11) finds the fee inconvenient but appreciates its potential environmental benefits.
“It’s a bit ridiculous, and I think people should start taking their bags with them to stores. However, it does serve its dissuasive purpose and could help clean up the environment,” he said.
The fee was introduced because of the rising amount of debris in the Anacostia River as a result of disposed bags.
“The District’s bag tax is not to generate revenue but to cause a change in behavior,” Jim Foster, president of the Anacostia Watershed Society, said to The Washington Post.
The legislation for the fee was introduced in the winter of 2008 in the D.C. Council. According to D.C. councilmember Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6), one of the sponsors of the bill, 47 percent of the trash in the Anacostia River was from disposable bags.
“The councilmembers considered various options to address this problem and concluded the best way was through the tax,” Wells said.
The revenues from the tax will go toward remedying the environmental problem.
“One cent would be kept by the retail store while 4 cents is kept in a fund which is meant to clean up the Anacostia River,” Wells said.
As reported by The Washington Post, bag taxes in other cities have not been passed because of public opposition. As councilmember Jack Evans told The Washington Post, the council did face opposition to the fee but was able to pass the legislation easily with the backing of businesses and advocates eager to save the Anacostia River from litter.
“I think it’s a good idea and I would definitely support any action to clean up the Anacostia River,” Chris Reid (COL’ 10) said.
The fee is expected to yield an estimated $3.6 million in its first year of enactment, according to a Post article. According to Wells, the main goal of the fee is to reduce the use of less reusable bags as time goes by. Similar bag fees in countries in Europe such as Ireland and Germany have a proven success rate.”

In light of D.C.’s unemployment rate, one of the lowest in the nation, the YouthBuild Public Charter School, located in Columbia Heights, is providing a unique opportunity for young men and women who have not completed their schooling and are in need of professional training and education.
The school educates its students by using a two-step approach. First, it prepares students to take their General Education Development tests, so that they may continue their education beyond the high school level. As part of the school’s vocational mission, it teaches students skills in construction by sending them to construction sites in the Columbia Heights, where they build low-income housing in an area of the D.C. neighborhood where close to 30 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, according to the Columbia Heights Action Research Project.
The YouthBuild Public Charter School was conceived by the Latin American Youth Center, a charitable group based in Columbia Heights, according to Rebecca Paavola, the assistant principal of the school. In 2005, the YouthBuild Public Charter School opened and began to teach young adults in Columbia Heights practical and academic skills, according to its Web site.
“[The aim is to help] young people ages 16-24 who have dropped out of traditional high schools,” YouthBuild PCS states in its mission statement.
The school’s demographics reflect its unique mission; for the 2008-2009 academic year, 75 percent of the student body’s reading level was below a high school level. In addition, 36 percent of the students were parents, and 38 percent had limited or no experience with English, according to the publicly posted school records.
YouthBuild draws financial support from both the public and private sectors. According to YouthBuild’s public records, the corporation received more than 100 million dollars in federal funds to support its organization. In addition, the local YouthBuild charter school has received funds from various private groups, the largest being a $100,000 grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, according to the school.
In addition to providing an education, YouthBuild provides other services for its students such as housing assistance and mentoring, according to the its Web site.
Even with such support, the school has been constrained by limited resources and has been forced to reject many applicants. The number of applicants has increased in the past two years.
“The year before last [2008-2009 school year] we had over 680 applicants and 85 spots. We didn’t have quite as many this past year, with 450, but the need is still very significant,” Paavola said.
The school offers a $200 stipend to students to help them support their families or pay for transportation.
Despite financial fears resulting from the recession, YouthBuild has continued to expand its program by building more classrooms and expanding the student capacity in the dorm. According to The Washington Post, YouthBuild is also planning to open a second campus in Northwest D.C. on the grounds of a closed elementary school, which will also provide some housing for homeless students.”

Georgetown University Medical Center conducted a record-breaking kidney exchange on Dec. 2 during which 26 different surgeries gave 13 patients with severe kidney disease life-saving organ replacements.
“Those people literally needed a needle in a haystack,” Keith Melancon, director of the Kidney Pancreas Transplant program at Georgetown University Hospital, said in a press release.
Among the recipients were some individuals who could not accept a kidney from the majority of the people on the national donor list. According to The Associated Press, one recipient in particular could not accept a kidney from 95 percent of the population. Additionally, of the 13 recipients, 10 were black, Latino or Asian-American, which constitute some of the groups for which it is most difficult to find a donor match from a living donor.
The marathon kidney exchange allowed all recipients to receive transplant kidneys their bodies would accept.
“Minorities in particular would find it extremely difficult to find a suitable donor using traditional donor match methods,” said Melancon in a press release. “By putting them in an exchange and giving them the option of a relatively new use of a blood cleansing technique called plasmapheresis, we can greatly increase their chances of getting a suitable donor as well as reduce their waiting time to get a transplant. Why wait in the long line for a deceased donor to come along if you can bring a donor and wait in the short line?”
105,390 individuals were on the national waiting list for a kidney, an increase by nearly 20,000 names since last year. Despite the growing demand for kidneys, there are fewer than 17,000 transplants performed each year in the United States. Taking greater advantage of kidney exchanges has the potential to enable up to 4,000 more transplants per year, according to Melancon.”

The university has been awarded over $20 million in federal stimulus funding to support the research efforts of 50 faculty members at the Georgetown University Medical Center and on the main campus, it announced in a press release on Jan. 5.
The grants, many of which will be distributed over the next two years, have been organized as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and originate from a range of national institutions including the Department of Education, the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.
This unprecedented increase in research funding to the university has been warmly welcomed by the faculty.
Howard Federoff, executive vice president for Health Sciences and executive dean of the School of Medicine, was granted $3.9 million for his research on developing treatment for Parkinson’s disease.
“These ARRA awards strengthen our world-class research and offer great potential for impacting public health,” Federoff said in a university statement.
While GUMC was allocated over $17 million of the stimulus funding, the main campus collected over $3 million of the grants, to be distributed to 11 faculty members. The remainder will be allocated to Federal Work Study grants.
Timothy Barbari, dean and associate provost for research, is optimistic that both undergraduates and graduates can benefit from the funding, which will also develop Georgetown’s research reputation.
“[Though such grants] have little impact on the number of courses taught, [they] can have an impact on course content when faculty introduce the latest research results into their existing courses,” Barbari wrote in an e-mail.
ore specific to undergraduates, the funding may result in increased research opportunities for undergraduates.
Radhakrishnan Padmanabhan, a professor in the department of microbiology and immunology, has been awarded with a two-year, $1.2 million grant for his research to develop antiviral therapeutics for the dengue virus, a human pathogen that affects 50 million people annually and is transmitted by mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical regions.
“[The funding] would give research training to undergraduate and graduate students in biomedical science,” Padmanabhan said.
Other grants have been awarded to Richard Weiss, a professor in the chemistry department, and Hongfang Liu, an assistant professor in the department of biostatistics, bioinformatics and biomathematics, among others.
According to a university statement, over 200 Georgetown grant proposals remain pending.”

Georgetown students may have seen the Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle buses’ new paint job, but what students may not know is that the buses are now reducing the university’s carbon footprint by using an environmentally friendly biodiesel blend fuel.
“Georgetown continues to look for ways to become more sustainable, and using the biodiesel blend is something we can do at low cost to the university,” Karen Frank, vice president of facilities and student housing, said in a university statement.
The 16 GUTS buses running to Rosslyn and Dupont Circle, which ran on ultra-low sulfur diesel in the past, are now using B20 biodiesel blend. The new fuel is made up of 80 percent petroleum diesel and 20 percent biodiesel and is manufactured from domestically produced oils, such as animal fats or recycled cooking oils. The university vehicles’ engines did not need be converted in order to accommodate the new B20 blend.
“We worked with the Sustainable Action Committee to propose sustainable transportation,” said Kristin Ng (COL ’11), president of EcoAction. “We’re glad they’ve finalized this. It has been in the works for a long time.”
According to a university statement, the university has set the goal of reducing its carbon footprint by 50 percent by 2020. As of now, the university is on track to accomplishing this goal, having decreased its footprint by 17 percent within the last three years.
Georgetown has made other changes to become more sustainable. The golf carts used on campus run on electricity. A vehicle used by Georgetown University Outdoor Education runs on 100 percent vegetable oil. The solar array on the roof of the Intercultural Center is the longest running installation of its scale in the country after being built in 1984.
In accordance with Jesuit ideals, a key goal of Georgetown’s sustainability plan is educating the community on the topic.
“The university is trying to educate our community about the importance, at large, of alternative fuel use and set an example in the process,” said James Connor, university fleet manager.”

After perennial criticism from some students for not accomplishing enough, Georgetown University Student Association worked to remedy these allegations last semester and plans on making headway on some new projects this spring.
“Our original platform was founded upon four main concepts: Career Center reform, intellectual life, student life and student safety. We are proud to say that we have made significant progress in each of these areas,” President Calen Angert (MSB ’11) and Vice President Jason Kluger (MSB ’11) wrote in an e-mail.
While Angert and Kluger have made progress on many of their projects – including an updated SafeRides system more accessible to students, the establishment of the GUSA Fund and a new Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle bus route to the Rosslyn Safeway – there is still work to be done this spring.
To cater to students unable to afford the high cost of LSAT preparation courses, Angert and Kluger helped establish a subsidized course operated through the Career Center. They also doubled the size of the GUSA Summer Fellows program. Yet the pair still hope to improve intellectual life at Georgetown in other ways.
Angert and Kluger seek to found a program through which students can bring their professors to lunch at local restaurants for a discounted rate.
“We have contacted a number of restaurants in the Georgetown area in hopes of receiving meal/drink discounts when students bring a professor to lunch,” Angert and Kluger wrote in an e-mail.
Additionally, Angert and Kluger tried to implement changes based on the student life survey they distributed at the beginning of their term last spring. These included increased GUTS bus routes on weekends, including the Rosslyn Safeway run, which they deemed important after the closure of the Wisconsin Avenue Safeway for renovations last spring.
In another measure to improve student safety, Angert and Kluger created a program that allows certified students to drive the SafeRides vans to locations on and off campus. The goal of this program is to increase Department of Public Safety presence on the street on weekends. Angert and Kluger, as well as the rest of the GUSA executive board, have been certified to drive the vans.
In an effort to increase the GUSA senators’ accountability, the senate voted in September to reduce the number of senate positions for October’s election in response to last year’s poor attendance records. It also established new rules that stipulate that senators must sit on at least one committee, and instituted stricter guidelines regarding senate meeting attendance.
Last semester, the senate addressed issues it deemed most important to the student body.
Senator Josh Mogil (SFS ’11) introduced a resolution that called for the Georgetown Student Code of Conduct to enact harsher penalties for crimes motivated by hate.
ogil also introduced an act that established a student commission to study student advocacy on campus. The commission will explore the feasibility of establishing a student advocacy board to answer students’ questions about violations of the Student Code of Conduct, including alcohol and housing offenses.
At the end of the semester, the executive and the senate worked together to pass the legislation necessary to establish the GUSA Fund, one of Angert and Kluger’s campaign promises.
“[The GUSA Fund] will span a wide variety of student initiatives, with mandatory minimums placed on diversity of programming, the arts and civic engagement,” Angert and Kluger wrote in an e-mail.
While drafting the bylaws of the fund, GUSA invited club leaders to a summit in November to discuss what they liked and disliked about the current funding process.
Most of the club leaders subject to the oversight of the Student Activities Commission complained of lacking transparency and accountability among SAC. In addition, most called for yearly budgets rather than individual allocations for activities, which is the current funding method used by SAC.
In response to these criticisms, GUSA passed a resolution mandating that the Funding Board, a committee consisting of 13 voting members, seven of whom are members of the senate’s Finance and Appropriations Committee, create a system of appeals for clubs who are denied funding. The board must publish all the minutes of their meetings in order to increase transparency and give clubs the option of lump-sum budgets allocated annually.”

The relaunch of the Collegiate Readership Program has been postponed as it waits to collect the necessary funds from its sponsors.
The program, which provides free copies of The New York Times, The Washington Post and USA Today at four different locations throughout campus, had been on hiatus during the fall semester due to a lack of funding from sponsors. According to Interhall’s Vice President of Student Advocacy Will Cousino (SFS ’12), the program was set to resume this past Wednesday, but the start date has now been moved to Feb. 1.
Cousino said newspaper delivery cannot begin until the program’s contract with USA Today is signed by the Office of Student Affairs. The signature is being withheld until all of the money pledged by sponsors has been transferred into the bank account that funds the program.
The sponsors, which include Interhall, The Corp, Georgetown University Student Association, Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union, the McDonough School of Business’ Dean’s Office and the Senior Vice President’s Office, have pledged $6,000 for the program.
“Sponsors have already been reminded to make the transfer and as long as all do so the program will still launch,” Cousino said.
Cousino and GUSA Vice President Jason Kluger (MSB ’11) have been working since the summer to restart the program and simultaneously keep in mind budget constraints.
“We have to bring it back right and make it sustainable,” Kluger said.
Students on campus who took advantage of the program last year are looking forward to its upcoming renewal.
“I’m thrilled that Georgetown is getting [its] priorities straight and bringing back the newspapers, because students need to be informed,” Maggie Donahue (COL ’11) said.
During their negotiations, Cousino and Kluger expressed a desire to ensure the solidity of the program’s financial and contractual agreements before any potential relaunch, in order to prevent funding cuts like those that halted the program in the fall semester. Kluger mentioned that they spoke to representatives from both USA Today and The New York Times about different possibilities for readership programs, hoping to obtain the highest number of newspapers for the cheapest price. They recently settled on a scaled-down program operated by USA Today.”

As roughly 65 members of the university community poured into a White-Gravenor classroom on Dec. 15 to discuss Georgetown Heckler articles deemed racially insensitive, the role and voice of student publications was once again put into question on the Hilltop.
At the two-hour community forum, then-Heckler Editor in Chief Jack Stuef (COL ’10) explained that the satirical writing, which appeared in the online publication’s December edition, served the purpose of highlighting existing racism on campus.
“As a Catholic and a Jesuit institution we are called to a higher standard,” Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson wrote in an e-mail read aloud by Frances Dávila (SFS ’10), the co-chair of MEChA who acted as a facilitator at the community forum. “We place great importance on open dialogue and free exchange of ideas, but offensive and inaccurate language does nothing to further this mission.”
Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., director of campus ministry, affirmed Olson’s sentiments.
“To paraphrase John Henry Cardinal Newman, and to echo what [University] President [John J.] DeGioia has said on other occasions, the best response to controversial speech is more speech,” O’Brien said. “So those offended and hurt by the Heckler’s attempt at satire should voice their views in a respectful, productive, articulate manner.”
He added that productive discussions had taken place within the community following the Heckler’s most recent issue.
“I was pleased with the level of honest, respectful discourse at Tuesday night’s forum,” O’Brien said.
Georgetown NAACP Chapter Representative Jheanelle Brown (SFS ’10) said that while she was upset by the most recent issue of the Heckler, she feels that satirical writing does not always have to play a negative role.
She cited THE HOYA’s April Fools’ issue last April as another example of satire gone awry.
“Satire would have a productive role on campus if it was executed correctly,” Brown wrote in an e-mail. “And that was the problem with THE HOYA’s April Fools’ issue last year and this article from the Heckler. For the Heckler, I think that they feel insulated [and] because they are writing under the guise of satire/humor, they go too far.”
Brown added that she does not feel that writers at the Heckler are individually racists.
“I don’t think that the writers (from what I can discern) are racist. That should be made clear,” Brown wrote in an e-mail.
Brown said that she does not believe the apology from Stuef was sufficient, however.
“Jack Stuef, former [editor-in- chief], issued an apology to those who responded to the situation. I don’t believe it was sincere,” Brown wrote in an e-mail. “So a sincere (public) apology would be great. And a commitment to engaging in constructive dialogue in the future.”
This campus-wide discussion occurs in the wake of a series of questions pertaining to bias in journalistic coverage, satirical or otherwise, posed to the university community in recent years.
In March 2001, The Georgetown Academy, “Georgetown’s Independent Journal of Faith and Reason,” which had previously received criticism for insensitive commentary, published an article that referred to students as “Alex Sanspenis, Christian Genderless and La Gordita.” The article’s publication and the reaction from many members of the university community later led to the public resignation of an Academy staff member and a call from Georgetown University Student Association for an apology from publication.
In September 2007, THE HOYA also received criticism for its insufficient attention to the Jena Six – a group of black high school students in Louisiana who many deemed were subjected to racial injustice. An on-campus protest of the incident had received less coverage than the ongoing debate of the university’s alcohol policy in an issue that fall.
Reactions to these incidents permeated campus culture; in the aftermath of the April Fools’ issue, THE HOYA faced sanctions from the Media Board and the publication’s efforts at independence were halted.
In a November 2002 letter to the editor published in THE HOYA, following the Academy incident, then-Vice President for Student Affairs Juan Gonzalez affirmed the need for dialogue in response to debates about free speech on the Georgetown campus.
“Georgetown has a strong, clear speech and expression policy,” Gonzalez wrote. “More speech, not less, has always been the most tangible method of fostering these principles. Suppression of the free exchange of ideas would violate the very spirit of our policy.”
In an e-mail sent to the campus community Wednesday, University President John J. DeGioia wrote, “Mocking the history of oppression of others is not funny, does not build community and does not reflect well on those who engage in it. We often cannot know how our words or deeds can hurt one another – how such an act can bring back into another’s consciousness an experience of a previous injustice or indignity.”
“The critique that has unfolded in response to [the April Fools’ issue of THE HOYA and the most recent issue of the Heckler] has been responsible, respectful and fitting for an academic community that is committed to the free exchange of ideas,” DeGioia wrote.
Existing groups on campus, particularly the Student Commission for Unity, seek to address issues at Georgetown that relate to diversity.
According to SCU’s Web site, “[Georgetown students, upon entering the university,] become aware of prejudices they didn’t know they had, or they develop prejudices in communities that reinforce them. The [SCU] is dedicated to the pursuit of truth in identifying and reconciling those problems at Georgetown through institutionally approved research and grassroots advocacy uniting students with faculty, staff and administrators.”
Steuf and Brian Kesten, chairman of the SCU, declined to comment.”

After construction of the planned science center was halted amid the recession, the university has been given the green light to resume construction this semester as a result of a $6.9 million grant from the National Institutes of Standards and Technology.
“The receipt of this grant and moving forward on construction of a new science center are important steps in our long-term efforts to enhance science research and teaching space at Georgetown,” University Provost James O’Donnell said in a university press release.
ade possible by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the funds were awarded to support the founding of the Institute for Soft Matter Synthesis and Metrology, a research program to be built within the science center. The grant will be allocated toward the construction of the entire 155,000 square-foot facility, which is slated to open in fall 2012.
“It would be accurate to say that without the NIST grant, the building would still be on hold,” Associate Dean Ali Whitmer wrote in an e-mail.
According to Whitmer, the activities of the institute will be funded by other research grants.
any students expressed excitement at the prospect of new science facilities.
“I felt that a lot of the facilities have been subpar up to this point. The addition of the new science center is a much needed addition that will enable the Georgetown sciences to compete with our peer institutions,” said Thomas Clifford (COL ’11), a pre-med student.
“I think it’s about time. I don’t think it is going to benefit [my] class, but it’s going to be good for the research facilities in the three buildings to come under one building,” said Mahlet Megra (COL ’12), also a pre-med student.
The university submitted a two-part grant proposal to NIST last July that outlined the building plans as well as research and activities that would occur within the institute.
“It is important to note that the new building will house the research and teaching labs for all three of the lab sciences: chemistry, physics and biology. So the impact will go beyond the institute to benefit the community in a larger way,” Whitmer wrote in an e-mail.
According to a university press release, moving some of the research labs currently housed in the Reiss Science Building and White-Gravenor Hall to the new science center will open up space for further expansion in the science departments.”

Like so many wannabe politicos, I enrolled at Georgetown determined to study government, volunteer for national political efforts and make good “connections.” Four years later I left Georgetown having learned from a broad spectrum of the humanities departments, spent most of my energy focused on campus, and made some truly good and lifelong friends.
It was THE HOYA, more than anything else, that changed those emphases – and changed my heart as well.
THE HOYA office those days was in a dumpy room in the basement of Copley Hall, with an IBM Selectric typewriter and one or two old manual typewriters without spools for eraser tape. A couple of those two or three machines were consistently out of order because we tended to spill beer on them while arguing editorial stances or gesticulating too wildly in late-night bull sessions. When we finally did get a single computer, it tended to eat copy or turn it into bizarre gobbledygook as often as it actually recorded the words we meant to type.
Yet from those ratty accommodations grew a paper of extraordinary quality – regularly breaking important stories, spurring spirited campus dialogue, and providing a training ground for, in my four years alone, several full-time national journalists and the founder-proprietor (John K. Reagan) of the best fully independent, utterly free college-sports Web site in the country, hoyasaxa.com. It certainly didn’t hurt to be writing in 1984 when Georgetown won its only national basketball championship (I was sports editor for the fall start of that season), with national publications regularly perusing THE HOYA for tidbits about what was seen as a highly secretive and interesting program.
The real reason working for THE HOYA was life-changing, though, was that it provided front-row access, as it were, to a dynamic, stimulating, intellectually challenging university that had a real identity and soul. Unlike those at big state colleges, Georgetown’s professors actually did most of the teaching and engaged with their students, rather than dumping the task to teaching assistants. Georgetown’s student-athletes actually attended and participated in classes. Georgetown’s student organizations, of all sorts, had energy and spunk. And Georgetown’s traditions, its secret stairways and sometimes extravagant lore, infused the whole institution with a sense of permanence and importance that made a student journalist care – really care – about getting “the story” absolutely right.
That unique identity itself also provided fodder for some great hijinks that could not possibly have catalyzed the same reaction if the university’s personality were less distinctive. The best was one April Fools’ edition of THE HOYA that featured a photo of an obviously distressed Fr. Timothy Healy, university president, with his head in his hands, his hair askew and with the facial expression of a man who just received devastating news.
“Pope Orders Jesuits to Leave Georgetown” (or something very much like it) was the headline, with paragraph after paragraph of serious-sounding “reporting” with nary a giveaway joke line in the whole lead story. The caption under the photo provided a phone number for readers to call to learn more details. Calls were directed to a secret HOYA office back-line, manned by a rotating pool of HOYA editors pretending to be church officials (or somesuch). Students from all over campus called in – angry, horrified, some even weeping. They must not have read the other front-page “articles” full of pathetically sophomoric humor and the “This is an April Fools’ edition” notices that appeared at the bottom of the page in very, very small type.
But for serious news – such as when a campus official was charged with embezzlement – we at THE HOYA were there. When the economics department had an internal leadership fight, we were there. When U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick returned to teach on the Hilltop, we were there. And when Patrick Ewing and John Thompson Jr. won glory in Seattle, and the coach said when he died they should bury his body back at Georgetown – well, some of us were there in the front row for the game and literally lay flat-out in a rain-soaked gutter afterwards. Which is exactly where, to this day, many readers think we journalists figuratively spend our time.
By providing an open window into such a life-enriching school and lifelong home, THE HOYA taught the lesson that life is constantly to be explored, engaged and celebrated. Georgetown is both a place and an ideal to be treasured not for school, but for life. Hoya Saxa? Thanks to Georgetown, it’s life that rocks – that’s what.

Congratulations to The Hoya for 90 excellent years as a vital voice in the Georgetown University community.
One of Georgetown’s enduring values is a commitment to continuously building a vibrant, engaged community: one that responds to both individual and collective gifts, needs, backgrounds and concerns, and serves as a launching pad and home base to which one can return throughout life.
The Hoya plays a central role in this building process. It contributes to the dynamism of the community. It serves not only to keep people informed, but to raise important issues and provide a forum for disagreement, discussion and debate.
The Georgetown community has had an enormous influence on me. Like many alumni, I consider my four years as an undergraduate on the Hilltop to have been a transformative experience. It enabled me to believe in a life of many possibilities and in my potential to be a leader and to make a difference.
I graduated in 1968, a tumultuous period in our society. Going to school in Washington, D.C. and participating in the events of that time certainly influenced my views. But it was my engagement in the community of Georgetown that stimulated my critical thinking about my values, decisions and actions. It continues to this day.
From the moment I set foot on campus, I was amazed by my fellow students – their intelligence, knowledge, experience and ambition. People were brilliant and multidimensional. They were creative, fun and, very often, outrageous. In many ways, they seemed more worldly and sophisticated than I was.
We lived together in an intimate undergraduate community: one large enough that you could find your niche, yet small enough to be inclusive and nurturing. It was fueled by a truly student-centered faculty who genuinely cared about your thoughts and held high expectations for your development and performance.
It was a stimulating, provocative assembly of talented people. I built relationships listening to voices that challenged my frames of reference across multiple dimensions. I tested their perspectives as well.
I do not mean to describe the community exclusively as a hotbed of intellectual inquiry and reflection. It was not. There was ample partying and wonderfully ridiculous behavior. Wisconsin Avenue and M Street were thriving. Interpersonally, there was the full spectrum of melodrama, disagreements and feuds. Student politics was a blood sport.
But the combination of all this is what a vibrant community looks like.
For me, it was an energizing environment that provided the stimulus for self-examination. My relationships offered both a view of the world and a mirror to myself that pushed me to assess what I believed in and valued. It required that I understand my own strengths and weaknesses. It led me to make choices, both personal and professional, that have reaped tremendous fulfillment – choices that I am not certain I would have made without the benefit of my engagement in this community.
I made wonderful friendships at Georgetown that were nurtured by the intimacy of the community. The friendships have been valuable enough to have been sustained over the course of my life. I believe that they are so meaningful because of their foundation in a shared sense of self-discovery, which bonds us together.
This bond certainly reflects itself in the closeness of the class of 1968, our loyalty to one another and our widespread support of all things Georgetown.
The Georgetown community continues to be a home base for me. I have taken the opportunity to stay involved through the Alumni Admissions Program, the McDonough School of Business Board of Advisors, the Board of Regents and the Board of Directors. Each experience has presented the opportunity to build relationships with Hoyas from other eras and a new cadre of faculty. While not of the intensity of those of my undergrad years, these relationships have offered the same opportunity to see the world through experiences and perspectives of a phenomenally talented group of people, testing my assumptions and refining my points of view.
Through my involvement, I recognize that Georgetown today is a much more different – and even better – university than when I attended. I also see that the core value of building a community together endures. We are engaged within one another to capitalize on each of our individual gifts and experiences, and THE HOYA is a critical voice for this endeavor. Hoya Saxa!

When I graduated in May 2001 with a J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center, the commencement speaker singled me out at the time as the oldest person, at 68, to have earned a law degree from the school.
Today, at 77, it appears I’m the oldest reporter at The Washington Post writing daily news stories.
Perhaps it is age alone that qualifies me to participate in this anniversary issue, since I’m just a bit younger than THE HOYA itself. And, like your university’s newspaper, I’ve been through the ups and downs of the past decades, trying to record what was going on as best I could.
Looking back, the economy and war have been dominant in my lifetime. I was born during the Depression. My teenage years were colored by World War II, college years by the Korean War and subsequent military service, and early adult years by Vietnam. Middle age saw family-raising amid inflation, then boom and bust of the dot-com era. Today it’s terrorism, war and recession.
ost of my adult life, beginning in1966, has been spent at The Washington Post, although in truth the first bylined article I had featured in the Post was in 1959. I freelanced a piece in the Outlook section based on the plans I had obtained from open government sources that detailed specifications for armored limousines being purchased for then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. I still depend on public records as the foundation for much of my reporting.
Over the years I took what were, in effect, three sabbaticals from journalism. The first two, in the 1960s, were to run separate 18-month investigations for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, initiated by its then-chairman, Sen. J. William Fulbright (D-Ark). The last was a half sabbatical, time off during the six years from 1995 to 2001 when I went to Georgetown Law.
The 36 months in the Senate taught me more about the realities of government than any reporter could learn in 36 years covering government. Those six years at Georgetown during the Clinton presidency reminded me how important the law is to our society. But more importantly, that time allowed me to be a student with other, younger students. A sidelight was the chance to write long – not 600- or 1,000-word newspaper stories, but 20- to 30-page detailed, footnoted – term papers for great seminar courses.
I’ve laid out this record not only because it’s an ego trip, but to say that being old and old-fashioned has its advantages, even if the modern media world seems to have sped up.
Seeking out public records, like those plans for FBI Director Hoover’s limousines 50 years ago, should still be a foundation for journalism today. It’s even more important at a time when news organizations are bombarded with press conferences, 24-hour commentators and canned statements by both public officials and those who just want to see themselves on TV or in the press.
I have covered U.S. activities in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past six years in part by reading the list of public solicitations for government contract services published each day on the fbodaily.com web-site. Often, I know more about the facts on the ground from the contract offerings than colleagues who cover the daily Pentagon, Kabul or Baghdad press conferences.
The challenge to journalism is that today we are living in what I call a PR, or public relations, society; where people regularly do or say what they want, whether it is true or not, in order to push their own programs or policies.
Eighty years ago, Walter Lippmann, in his extraordinary book “Public Opinion,” witnessed the rise of PR – although in his day it was the press agent or publicity man who was involved. “The picture which the publicity man makes for the reporter is the one he wishes the public to see,” Lippmann wrote. Substitute any press secretary or party spokesman today for this description: “He is censor and propagandist, responsible only to his employers, and to the whole truth responsible only as it accords with the employers’ conception of his own interests.”
It is the job of journalists to sort out the facts and present them as best they can in whatever media they use. Lippmann put it this way, “At its best the press is a servant and guardian of institutions; at its worst it is a means by which a few exploit social disorganization to their own ends.”
Good luck to THE HOYA in its next 90 years.

As the first investor in and strategic adviser to Twitter, each of my 11 lessons learned at Georgetown is fewer than 140 characters in length:
1) Learn now, train later. Fr. Otto Hentz, S.J. taught me that undergrad is your one chance to Learn with a capital L. Forget your MBA!
2) Be interesting. Read, debate, write, experience, listen, care, speak up, create, take pictures, be proud of who you are.
3) Go abroad. Already gone? Go again. Nothing teaches humility and builds alternative perspectives like gritty travel.
4) Help. Each day, be able to answer the question, “Was I helpful today?” with a simple, “Yes.”
5) Exercise. Even if you aren’t on a varsity squad, be an athlete. Play sports, work out, enter marathons and take on long bike rides. Do yoga.
6) Be present. Forget your long-distance Skyping. Cast the future out of your mind. Be right here, right now. Breathe in this very moment.
7) Feel lucky. None of us got here completely on our own. Families, friends, teachers and the Hoyas who came before us all made this possible.
8) Question your faith. Fearless listening and open questioning of our assumptions and beliefs give us the chance for greatness.
9) Excel. Good grades aren’t hard to get. Half the battle is just showing up. Do all the reading, and turn in all your work. Easy.
10) Forget The Tombs. It will still be there tomorrow, and most folks won’t remember what happened there anyway. Go to bed early and rock mañana.
11) Chicken Madness. You have a moral obligation to eat many of them on behalf of those of us who aren’t so fortunate to have Wisey’s nearby.
12) I said “11 lessons,” right? Always underpromise and overdeliver.

My experience as a reporter in D.C. started with four years of working for zero compensation: no money, no course credit, not even a free T-shirt.
You could say that was excellent training for today’s lousy journalism market. But my time at Georgetown University – during which I wrote for THE HOYA’s younger next-door neighbor, The Georgetown Voice – taught me more about reporting than just how to suffer for it.
It helps that journalism isn’t the most complicated job in the world: You ask questions, ask some more, then write up the answers in a way that makes people want to read. A good liberal arts education ought to teach most of those skills, but even then Georgetown didn’t amount to an obvious classroom for them – the School of Foreign Service didn’t have a single journalism class for me to take. Yet in some weird way that lack of institutional support made Georgetown a good place to learn the basics of this business. I’ve included some of the most important tidbits I learned over the years.
1. Don’t wait for story assignments. There was nothing mandatory about signing up to write for THE HOYA or The Voice my freshman year. You had to hike up to the fourth floor of the Leavey Center to volunteer. And if you didn’t have a half-decent idea for an article to suggest to an editor, you might wait for a writing opportunity. To this day, my first words of advice to any freelance writer are “Solve an editor’s problem – suggest a story instead of asking for one.”
2. Write quickly and cleanly. Having a full schedule of classes and a part-time job did not leave much time for students at either paper to polish their prose or edit that of others. Neither did the limited inventory of computers in each office. That experience provided tough, consistent and immensely valuable practice in the art of filing clean copy in a hurry – something even more vital now that most of my writing appears in blog or Twitter form. (Those time constraints also helped me learn a different skill useful in journalism: taking short naps.)
3. Take criticism graciously. Experienced editors usually try to let a reporter down gently when editing badly written copy, while the same may not be true of tired, stressed fellow students. But if you can cope with a cranky colleague venting frustration by taking it out on your draft, you can also deal with readers who may show far less tact in criticizing your work.
4. Don’t be afraid to make people angry. One of the last stories I wrote looked into why the university had not asked President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68) to speak at the SFS graduation in 1993 and instead invited Librarian of Congress James Billington (who, for the record, gave a fine speech himself). I stayed up all night to finish a paper after we put that issue to bed, which meant I was there in the Voice office when the phone rang at around 8 a.m. It was then-SFS Dean Peter Krogh, calling to chew me out for the effrontery of asking Billington’s office for comment. If you don’t mind eliciting such a reaction – or if you secretly enjoy it – you may be journalist material, too.
5. Competition is good. If you’re the only person writing about something, it may be tempting to skip making that one last call or double-checking that one last detail in a story that you tell yourself “you just know.” But if somebody else is waiting to beat you to the story, you won’t want that competitor – whether it’s a blogger you’ve never met or the newspaper next door – to get there first. So from this Voicer: Congratulations and a tip of the hat to THE HOYA on making it to 90 years.

The classrooms were filled with the lingering haze of gray ash. The metal desks where students so recently listened to lectures were twisted by the heat into grotesque shapes. Blackened bubbles of paint streaked down the walls. The roof was completely burned away. The chalkboards showed a few recognizable marks from the last lessons before riots devastated this seminary in Kaduna, Nigeria.
The fighting that created this apocalyptic scene in February 2000 stemmed from the adoption of Shariah, or Islamic law, into the Nigerian state’s civil code. Christians living here saw Shariah as a threat. Civil rights groups feared harsh punishments – like amputation for theft and stoning for adultery – would soon be handed down to Nigerian citizens. Nigerian Muslims felt it was an integral part of their religious tradition. At first, the protests were peaceful. Yet Kaduna was soon filled with burning homes, schools and markets. Hundreds were killed by both Muslims and Christians. Cycles of retaliation spread the religious and ethnic conflict to other parts of the country.
I went to Kaduna a few weeks after the riots as a freelance television producer to speak to Muslims and Christians about the strife. It was hard to believe how shockingly brutal the fighting had been between people who had once lived as peaceful neighbors.
I learned much from both Muslims and Christians during the journey. I felt, however, there was much more to understand about the bigger picture when it came to the relationship between the Muslim world and the West. During my search for a university program that would help me explore these issues, I found the master’s degree program offered under Georgetown’s Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding. It was a chance to study under leading scholars in a field that was becoming increasingly significant on the world’s stage. I applied right away.
Then came Sept. 11, 2001. The classes I took with John Voll, Yvonne Haddad and John Esposito were filled with fellow students from all sides of the issue – from Muslim-Americans to those working in the intelligence community. It was an extraordinary time to study this topic.
We had many challenging class discussions about what the attacks meant for everything from domestic civil rights to foreign policy. More than once, the class conversations became heated. There were even tears shed by some students by the time the sessions were over. Prejudices were broken down. Understanding was built up. We learned as much from each other as we did from the lectures.
I was working at The Associated Press as a television and online video producer at the same time I was attending Georgetown. What I learned about the different facets of modern Islam translated directly into multimedia reports I filed for my job. The knowledge I gained at Georgetown about Shiite Islam helped inform my scripts about ethnic and religious divisions in Iraq. Some of those lively class discussions led to a story about what it was like to be a Muslim woman living in post-9/11 America.
y program at Georgetown also helped prepare me for a series of reports I worked on with AP’s religion reporters about the “the struggle for Islam.” These reports explored the internal debates within the Muslim community, from Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood to Great Britain’s immigrant community and Muslims in American prisons.
y relationship with Georgetown continued after I finished my degree. The Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding encouraged my ongoing research into the relationship between Muslims and Christians. This included a book and documentary about a group of Mennonites who migrated to Central Asia in the 1880s in search of religious freedom. These Mennonites also believed the Second Coming of Christ would occur in the Khanate of Khiva in 1889. After recovering from the shock of failed prophecies, these Christians remained in the Muslim kingdom. Over the decades they formed a prime example of peaceful cooperation and coexistence between two very different religious communities.
Today’s news industry is as demanding and competitive as it ever has been. Newspapers are declining, and online media are on the rise. The ability to produce a well-crafted story across platforms including text, video and interactive media is an ever more important skill. Some technical knowledge about these various platforms is essential. Nevertheless, there is no technical substitute for understanding the big issues of the day, and being able to communicate how those issues affect those around us. Good storytelling skills are crucial. I am proud to say that my experience at Georgetown enriched my personal understanding of those big issues, and has made me a better journalist.
Walter Ratliff (GRD ’04) is the content manager at the Associated Press in Washington, D.C. He is also the producer/director of the documentary “Through the Desert Goes Our Journey,” and author of “Pilgrims on the Silk Road: A Muslim-Christian Encounter in Khiva.”

A final decision was not reached by the D.C. Board of Zoning Adjustment at the Jan. 12 appeal hearing of Philly Pizza & Grill. Until the next hearing, which will take place on Feb. 9, Philly Pizza will continue to operate under its stay of enforcement granted Nov. 17, which allows the establishment to remain open until a decision is reached.
Philly Pizza’s policy of closing the doors at 2 a.m. with a continued delivery option will still be in effect through the stay of enforcement period.
ehmet Kocak, the owner of Philly Pizza, said that he would continue fighting despite strong opposition from the Advisory Neighborhood Commission and Georgetown residents.
“We don’t want to close the doors. The doors are open. The people will still get pizza,” Kocak said.
The primary issue addressed at the Jan. 12 meeting was whether or not Philly Pizza is a fast food restaurant or a sit-down restaurant. The Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs revoked its certificate of occupancy on Oct. 14, claiming that the establishment violated its terms of occupancy by operating as a fast food restaurant, although it is registered as a sit-down restaurant. According to zoning laws, only sit-down restaurants can be located on residential streets–such as Potomac St., on which Philly Pizza is located.
Following the revocation and resulting stay of enforcement, Kocak appealed to the BZA, resulting in the six-hour meeting that will continue on Feb. 9. The cross-examination of witnesses and further testimony will occur on this date. If the Feb. 9 meeting runs over again, the stay of enforcement will be addressed by the Board. Mercedes Frazier, a receptionist for the D.C. Office of Zoning, said that about 90 percent of the time, cases that come up are decided on that day, so the length of this hearing is an anomaly.
During the hearing, both sides debated the ability of residents from the ANC to testify. ANC Chair Ron Lewis and Commissioner Bill Starrels, along with their attorney Martin Sullivan, were key opposing players to Kocak in the meeting.
John Patrick Brown Jr., Philly Pizza’s legal representation, argued that the case against Philly Pizza was insubstantial.
“This investigation was flawed from beginning to end . There’s been no paperwork, no reports, no photographs, no documents provided by the DCRA . there has been no documentation [about Philly Pizza’s practices in August] presented to support their investigation,” Brown said about overriding some legal technicalities.
Kocak argued that Philly Pizza meets the requirements for a sit-down restaurant. He presented a poster of pictures depicting families enjoying dinner at Philly Pizza with red dishes, silverware, and napkins.
Opponents questioned the validity of his claim on several grounds. Philly Pizza does not contain a dishwasher; instead, there is a 3-sink unit in the basement of the restaurant, which sometimes accounts for a failure to clean dishes in a very timely manner. The establishment also does not have any glassware.
“Lack of a dishwasher is indicative to me that you are not planning on a restaurant operation . Is [the dishware] simply a token gesture toward a restaurant use? I’m very concerned [that] from the operational standpoint he isn’t meeting the burden of proof as a restaurant . A dishwasher is one of the basic things you have to have to have a restaurant,” said Michael Turnball of the Zoning Commission.
To strengthen his claim, Kocak cited an increase in dine-in customers. He argued that after his first 16 months of business, his business was continuing to grow and his core customer sit-down base was increasing.
45 percent of Kocak’s customers currently are dine-in. However, Philly Pizza’s opponents believe that there were fewer dine-in customers in August, when the DCRA conducted its investigation.
DCRA’s General Counsel Melinda Bolling and members of the Zoning Commission objected to a spreadsheet of numbers Kocak and Brown produced that seemed to distort percentages of take-out, sitting in and delivery. The delivery numbers were excluded from the first table, and the board reacted very adversely to this.
“You’ve excluded some evidence . For us to [skew] these numbers and take out delivery [statistics] is just inappropriate and wrong,” Bolling said.
Sullivan pointed out that Kocak’s numbers of carry-out and sitting in were continuing to increase as this case has continued.
Sullivan said that Philly Pizza should close every night at 11 p.m.
“Kocak has gotten away with this [late closure] for a year and a half; it’s harmed my clients, and it continues,” said Sullivan.
Brown argued that the establishment should not close earlier than it currently is.
“My client closing at 11 o’clock [is] suicide for my client. My client would agree to all nights close at 2:30, and he would be allowed to continue his delivery on Friday and Saturday until 3:30,” said Brown.
“We love all the support. We don’t want to shut the doors,” said Kocak.”

Like me, you might get a good laugh when a friend wakes up after a long night out only to realize that he left a tab open at the bar and ran up a bill he can’t afford. Our leaders in Congress seem to have done much the same thing. But it’s much less funny when you consider that we will be the ones paying for their drunken spending.
In 2008, the federal government’s obligations – that is, the money it has promised citizens who qualify for programs including Medicare, Social Security and veterans’ benefits – ballooned to $56.4 trillion. Each individual’s share of that bill is $184,000. Having maxed out the national credit card, members of Congress are now seeking a higher national debt limit as they go out on yet another binge. Before they do, it’s about time young people said something.
Over the last decade, our government has turned steady surpluses into monstrous deficits, doubling the national debt, which now exceeds $12 trillion. In 2009 alone, our budget deficit hit a record $1.4 trillion. We had to borrow about 40 cents on every dollar we spent. And the $383 billion we paid in interest on the national debt is enough to have covered the entire war in Afghanistan to date. At the same time, our representatives failed to address what the Government Accountability Office predicts to be a $62 trillion long-term fiscal gap created by unfunded liabilities in programs including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. The consequences of this recklessness will soon be magnified.
Consider that, within the next 10 years, the amount of money our federal government brings in will barely be enough to pay for mandatory spending on our main entitlement programs and debt interest – and that spending won’t even include the other main functions of government, from defense to education. As the red ink continues to rise, our dollar will decline, and we will be at the mercy of foreign creditors like China, who will determine interest rates and own an even greater stake in our country.
Two things are clear. First, our current fiscal path is dangerous and unsustainable. Second, as the GAO recently wrote, “the longer action to deal with the nation’s long-term fiscal outlook is delayed, the larger the changes will need to be, increasing the likelihood that they will be disruptive and destabilizing.” Now is the time to act.
On Jan. 20, the Senate is expected to vote on a measure to raise the federal debt limit – or the amount of money our government can borrow to pay its bills – by some $1.8 trillion. It will be the fifth such vote in less than two years and an opportune time to hold our leaders accountable. We must demand that they begin taking action to address our fiscal challenges – from re-establishing budget controls to managing entitlement spending. But it seems the regular order of our current legislative process, marked by institutionalized partisanship and myopia, is ill-equipped to handle such a task.
A proposal by Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) and Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) – to be offered as an amendment to the debt increase bill – will solve that problem by creating a bipartisan fiscal commission. Comprised of 18 members – legislators equally divided between chambers and parties, the Treasury secretary and a presidential appointee – the commission would study the problems before us and make recommendations that would be fast-tracked for a vote in Congress. The commission model has been effectively employed before, most notably under President Reagan in 1983 when Social Security’s solvency was successfully extended through a series of reforms.
Young people have the most to lose from continued inaction and should urge their senators to support this proposal. No longer can we accept more of the same bipartisanship – or Republicans trading their tax cuts to Democrats for their spending programs – as we dig ourselves deeper into debt. Being good stewards of our nation and the American dream requires making tough choices and working together in a sensible and productive manner.
As Thomas Jefferson often noted, one generation passing trillions of dollars of debt on to another is not just irresponsible – it is also immoral. Our elected officials have no right to squander the security and prosperity of citizens not yet enfranchised or not yet even born. It’s time for the millennial generation to organize and take a stand on this issue – not just for ourselves, but for our own posterity.

At rare moments in American history, the stars align in favor of events so dramatic that they would seem absurdly contrived if manufactured by a novelist or a Hollywood screenwriter. Take, for example, the coinciding deaths of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams – former adversaries-turned-confidants – on the nation’s 50th anniversary. Or consider the living allegory that was the Scopes trial, or even red-baiting Richard Nixon’s journey to China in 1972.
Enter Perry v. Schwarzenegger.
This week in San Francisco, oral arguments began in a case that – if ultimately appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court – could make same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states. The case is made even more distinctive by the team that is representing the plaintiff. Ted Olson – arguably the most successful Republican attorney in America and the man whose argument in Bush v. Gore delivered the White House to George W. Bush – has joined with his liberal adversary in that case, David Boies, to challenge California Proposition 8, which outlaws gay marriage.
Despite its transformative potential, the case has elicited criticism from some gay rights organizations and skepticism from a myriad of legal scholars. Many believe Olson and Boies are reaching too far, too fast.
At best, commentators approach the case with ambivalence, almost as if they are already preparing themselves for an inevitable setback. Given the bitter disappointment of the gay rights community in the aftermath of Prop 8’s passage and the ballot defeat of gay marriage in Maine, this impulse is understandable.
Yet I refuse to believe that gay rights supporters do not feel, at some level, excited about the potential of the case. This exhilaration does not have to be rejected as irrational or unrealistic. For several reasons, Perry is just what the marriage equality cause needs.
First of all, the legal prognosis for the case is not as dire as many analysts suggest. If Perry is ultimately taken all the way to the Supreme Court, recent casework has set a clear precedent for the Court to decide Perry in the plaintiffs’ favor. The task at hand is to make the justices feel comfortable about striking down laws in as many as 45 states. Having a staunch conservative leading the case, especially one so admired as Olson, is the best way to do so.
But even if the dire outlook of the case proves accurate, Perry is still laudable. The marriage equality movement is at a crossroads. The state-by-state strategy has largely run its course, achieving full equality in only five states and Washington, D.C.
Each rendition of statewide voting on same-sex marriage reinforces the notion that it is acceptable to subject gay rights to majority rule. Continuing to rely on this limited strategy poses greater risk than the road taken by Perry. Issues of equality before the law belong in the courts, not at the voting booth.
The case’s greatest political potential may lie in the imagery provided by Olson’s involvement. Every conservative who reads or hears about the case will take notice that the attorney who made Bush’s presidency a reality is carrying the banner of gay marriage.
One of the most pernicious characteristics of American society is that many people live completely isolated from those who disagree with them politically. Sometimes all it takes to disrupt herd mentality is one person of a similar political disposition voicing disagreement. Not all – or even many – conservatives are likely to be immediately swayed by Olson’s role. But all conservatives will have some thinking to do.
Furthermore, the case provides a platform for Olson to begin to break down rigid ideological identities and provide a new vocabulary for the discussion of gay marriage. Many Americans conform to pre-set categories, like “social conservative,” and are not even cognizant of the language to identify themselves as conservatives who support gay marriage. Just last week, however, Olson penned an essay for Newsweek entitled, “The Conservative Case for Gay Marriage.”
On the other side, members of the gay rights movement must not consider themselves immune to the herd mentality of their conservative opponents. Perry should be a wake-up call that there is potential to find supporters in unlikely places. Doing so will require the recognition that walking lock step with the Democratic Party is not the most viable strategy to advance marriage equality. Vigorously supporting the rare Republican candidate who supports gay marriage should be a priority of gay rights organizations.
The legal journey of Perry v. Schwarzenegger may last for much of this new decade. In the meantime, however, it can provide just the shot in the arm the marriage equality movement needs to regroup, redouble its efforts and fundamentally reshape American political discourse.

During the final days of last semester, I, like many others, was trapped here on campus by the Snowpocalypse. Tests were finished, papers were handed in and not much else was going on beside snowball fights and viewings of “Love Actually” accompanied by hot chocolate. In order to help pass the time, I picked up extra shifts at Vital Vittles. As few students were left on campus, however, the hours passed slowly there as well.
That is, until I discovered the magazine rack, chock full of old issues of Newsweek, Vanity Fair and Hip-Hop Weekly Magazine. One article in Time has stayed with me. It labeled the past 10 years as the “Decade from Hell.” If you haven’t read the article, you should – even though it was published almost two months ago. It does a fine job recounting and explaining what went wrong during the so-called Lost Decade.
The article stuck with me because I realized that we grew up while al-Qaida was attacking us, we were invading Afghanistan and Iraq, Mother Nature was losing her temper everywhere and economies were crumbling worldwide. Our generation came of age in the “Decade of Broken Dreams” and lived through some of the worst of times. What does that mean for us and our dreams?
As I related in my very first column, I will always remember where I was on Sept. 11, 2001. But many of my memories are just as wrapped up in the other cataclysmic events of these past 10 years: the fear of birthday letters being filled with anthrax, the bomb drills and simulated lockdowns in school after the D.C. sniper attacks, a seventh-grade dance where rumors spread that the army had captured Osama bin Laden – and we the kids actually cried tears of joy. We had grown up hating the man, praying for his death, but we didn’t even know why.
Images of Americans drowning in the floodwaters of New Orleans – the city where I had celebrated my brother’s graduation only three months before – haunted my young mind. Our stately politicians instructed us in dishonesty and corruption while our beloved athletes taught us the arts of cheating and greed. The stories out of Gitmo and Abu Ghraib confused and shamed us, forcing us to question our American ideals, our American identities. As the market melted down and our promised share in the American dream seemingly vanished, we realized we’d been tricked and taken for a ride by our neighbors who worked on Wall Street and Main Street.
This is the environment in which we grew up. These were the people to whom we looked up. Those are the memories I have – but they are not the only ones.
For every moment I saw scenes of gunfire in Iraq on the news, I also spent half an hour marveling at the adventures of Cory and Topanga on “Boy Meets World” or laughing with Kenan and Kel. The economy may have taken a dip in 2001, but I was still pining for a PlayStation 2, racing my heart out on “Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit.” My family and I still vacationed in New Orleans the summer of 2006 – just at Camp Hope with Habitat for Humanity, instead of the Radisson in the French Quarter. Two years later, recession or not, I still went to prom.
Of course there was a lot of crying, sighing, hugging and yelling. Of course things were not the same after 9/11 or the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean or the Virginia Tech shootings. Of course life disconcerted and disoriented us, pulling us in many different directions.
But isn’t that what life does? It messes with you, throws you off course so that you can learn something – about the world, yourself, another. While the devastation of the decade may have drubbed humanity, I would not go so far as to call it the decade from hell. Us children of the last 10 years have emerged better because of them. Because we are the witnesses of a sordid history, one that has taught us about the complex challenges we have inherited, we are better prepared to face them head on. The global state of distress and desolation has inspired within us a call to serve, to be passionate stewards and zealous combatants.
The beginnings of this work are evident here on our campus, in which ideas like social justice, environmentalism and interreligious dialogue thrive. Yes, more work needs to be done, and there is a lot of room for progress. We are just at the beginning. The point is that the complacent millennial generation The New York Times columnist David Brooks once described as apathetic and self-absorbed no longer exists. We are changed. In its place, our new generation of global leaders is emerging – one shaped by this “Decade of Broken Dreams” – but one dreaming and ready to fight for a better world.
