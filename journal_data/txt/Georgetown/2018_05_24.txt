Luci Baines Johnson, the daughter of President Lyndon Johnson and founder of LBJ Family Wealth Advisors, a family-owned wealth management firm, urged School of Nursing and Health Studies graduates to maintain their dreams, commit to service and lead a purpose-driven life in the field of health care at Saturday’s commencement.
Johnson, who attended the NHS her freshman year but left in 1966 to marry her first husband, cultivated an ethos of cura personalis in her work as a philanthropist, businesswoman and mother, she said.
“The heart of nursing is the promotion of wellness, not just the cure of disease,” Johnson said.
Although her marriage interrupted her own dream of graduating from Georgetown, the perspective Johnson developed while at the university informed her approach to life and gave her “meaning and purpose,” she said. Despite her own delayed dream, she eventually graduated from St. Edward’s University in 1997 — and finally earned her degree from Georgetown at Saturday’s ceremony, receiving an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters.
“You never are too old to dream,” Johnson said. “Since I’ve left Georgetown I’ve had many dreams fulfilled in a life of volunteer service, motherhood and business.”
Although NHS graduates may be realizing their own dream of graduating from college, Johnson advised them to now adopt a new dream, emphasizing the critical role graduates will play in the health care field and how that can inform this dream.
“You’re entering professions where you are desperately needed, in a time of great specialization and great uncertainty,” Johnson said.
The service component of health care should inform graduates’ approach to their work, Johnson said. She noted the academic organization of the NHS, a school that serves as an umbrella for diverse professions dedicated to improving the human condition, ranging from health care management and policy to human science.
“As health care professionals, every day you will have the great opportunity to lose yourself in the service of others,” Johnson said. “And in return, you will find yourself again, every day.”
Volunteer service, whether in health care, social justice or politics, defined Johnson’s life, she said. She encouraged graduates to seek the same commitment to volunteer service in their own lives.
“There is simply no way to measure the joy that comes from helping a child to see, nurses to heal, schools and universities to succeed, migrant workers to get an education, gardens to grow, social justice to be advanced, your candidate to win and mostly, especially, your own children to thrive,” Johnson said. “But no matter the calling, the satisfaction of believing I might have left someone’s world a better place than I found it has made my life worth living.”
Johnson’s challenge to “keep living a purpose-driven life” centered on a commitment to service, recalling the dedication of Florence Nightingale, the founder of the modern nursing profession,  to revolutionizing the field of nursing.
“All of you must be as motivated as Florence Nightingale was to change and enhance knowledge and skills to meet expanding health care roles and health care systems,” Johnson said.
Johnson recalled her father’s fight to pass Medicare during his presidency and the need to continue the work to improve the country’s health care system in light of an aging population.
“The need for a more just health care system remains. The work continues. The Affordable Care Act had, has and will continue to have fierce opposition,” Johnson said. “Regardless of the political culture, nurses and health studies professionals have to continue their mission to be a force of reason for good.”
Despite the growing need for an improved health care system, a shortage of health care professionals and continued dedication to promoting wellness, Johnson said Georgetown graduates are ready for the challenge.
“Georgetown has prepared you to go to the frontline of crisis in health care,” she said. “With your help, the dream of a more affordable, effective health care system for all of us can come true.”

College students must be respectful of all viewpoints and allow others to speak, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) said in her commencement address to graduates of the Georgetown University Law Center on Sunday.
Norton, who has served as Washington, D.C.’s representative to Congress since 1990, was once an active member of the 1960s civil rights movement. She knows better than most what it takes for a social movement to succeed: According to Norton, it is free exercise of speech.
“Change will only occur if we make the highest, best and most peaceful use of the First Amendment,” Norton said.
However, freedom of speech is threatened, according to Norton. Quoting the Brookings Institute, Norton said that freedom of speech is “deeply imperiled on U.S. campuses” because some left-leaning university students are intolerant of conservative views.
“Will a generation that is using protest so precociously for issues they favor, like gun safety, exercise the tolerance that allows those who favor the opposite to at least be heard?” Norton said.
Norton insisted that preventing others from speaking is not acceptable. As a young lawyer, she had defended several people who had been prevented from speaking in public venues because they were known for making racist and anti-Semitic statements. She defended them not because she agreed with them, she said, but because they had a constitutional right to speak.
“My clients were a minority in our society: proselytizing racists and anti-Semites with whom I had nothing in common,” Norton said. “Yet it was clear that the ultimate client was the First Amendment.”
In addition to speaking at the commencement ceremony, Norton also received an honorary Doctor of Laws. Though he did not give an address, Merrick Garland, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, was also awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws. The Law Center graduation ceremony commenced on Healey Lawn, thanks to a respite from the previous day’s rain.
Allowing one’s opponents to speak is also vital to creating lasting change in the nation, Norton said.
“Those who have brought change to our country did not win it by shutting down the other side,” Norton said. “They persisted against their adversaries until they persuaded the country that they should prevail.”
Even once change-makers have convinced the courts, the general public must come to accept the change for it to last, Norton said.
“Change-makers, acting with vital help from the law, must persuade the democratic majority to accept change, even when they have won it in court,” Norton said.
When facing a new era of challenges not foreseen when the nation’s founding documents were written, the country must undergo a reteaching and relearning process to come to terms with the meaning of the Constitution and Bill of Rights in today’s terms, Norton said. The people best suited to this task, according to Norton, are not members of her generation, but the new Georgetown Law graduates who are more able to relate to younger Americans.
“Who is in the best position to help not only young people, but also the American people relearn the purposes and uses of the First Amendment for these times and in our polarized society?” Norton said. “I believe I am speaking to them now.”
The law graduates are particularly well-suited to convince other people of their generation, and in their profession, of the benefits of a free exchange of ideas, according to Norton.
“Trusted members of their own generation speaking in their own terms, speaking in their own language, offering reasons why hearing the other side of arguments is critical to our society,” Norton said. “After three years of law school, the Class of 2018 knows that lawyers sharpen their own cases best when they have heard the other side.”

Climate change and instability in the Middle East pose the greatest threats to the world security for the next generation, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said at the commencement ceremony for Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service on May 19 in McDonough Arena.
Guterres, who previously served as the United Nations high commissioner for refugees from 2005 to 2015 and as the prime minister of Portugal from 1995 to 2002, addressed the SFS Class of 2018 on Saturday, telling the graduates that the global community had not yet taken sufficient action to combat climate change.
“We need to rush in order to make sure that we change the pattern of the global economy in order to be able to contain climate change, but we are not yet doing enough,” Guterres said.
Guterres acknowledged the significance of the 2015 Paris Agreement, an international accord to reduce climate change signed by 195 countries in 2016, but insisted that urgent action remained necessary if the agreement were to have the intended impact.
“We need not only to commit to respect the Paris Agreement, but we need to do it with an enhanced ambition,” Guterres said. “We need to do more [and to do it] faster, if we want to preserve our planet and to avoid the horrible consequences of what would be a higher increase in the global temperatures.”
The Paris climate accord, which is set to go into effect in 2020, aims to keep the increase in the global temperature well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to limit the increase to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius to lessen the impacts of climate change.
President Donald Trump announced in June 2017 his plan to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, because he said it would harm the U.S. economy. Despite Trump’s announcement, U.S. withdrawal will not be possible until November 4, 2020, as stipulated by the agreement.
Guterres warned of the consequences stemming from climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of natural disasters, rising sea levels and growing acidity of the oceans among others. However, Guterres said there are reasons to be optimistic about progress being made in combatting climate change.
“Technology is on our side,” Guterres said. “We see that there are more and more jobs being created in renewable energies, both in the United States and China, more than the jobs created by the oil and gas industry.”
Investing in renewable resources is not just a necessity, but it would also be beneficial in moving forward technology globally.
“The stone age did not end for lack of stones. There were plenty of rocks in the world at that time,” Guterres said. “The stone age ended because new technologies would be able to provide better societies. Let’s not wait for fossil fuels to end to end the fossil fuel age. Let’s make sure we all join our efforts to create a world with a green economy and a sustainable future.”
Shifting gears to international affairs, Guterres also pointed to conflicts in the Middle East as a growing threat to global security.
“We see that in the last decade, we have a multiplication of conflicts, and at the same time the old conflicts seem never to die, be it in Somalia, in Afghanistan or the Democratic Republic of the Congo,” Guterres said.
However, these conflicts have also taken on new elements not previously seen in other global conflicts, according to Guterres.
“What is to a certain extent new is that these conflicts are becoming more and more interlinked with each other, with fighters going from one place to another, and more and more linked to what it is now a global threat of terrorism that, of course, creates insecurity and creates anxiety everywhere in today’s world,” Guterres said.
To conclude his speech, Guterres called upon the graduating seniors to take on the failures of his generation.
“Where my generation has largely failed, I strongly encourage to make sure that your generation delivers, that your generation creates the conditions to allow, with a strong commitment to service and using as much as possible all the talents that you have received in this school and multiplying them and distributing them, to make sure … that our future will allow my three granddaughters to live in a healthy world, without conflict and without suffering, and in a healthy planet that is green and sustainable,” Guterres said.

Great to see SFS attract such a high level speaker at commencement.  Certainly, better than when I graduated in 65.  But he did not speak about the diminishing role of the UN to solve some of these problems, especially in the Middle East. I hope the new generation of SFS graduates achieves goals that are higher than mine. But I did spent a successful career reducing poverty around the world through promoting and creating cooperatives.

Using technology, recent graduates can work to forge a more equitable society, Ursula Burns, former chairman and CEO of Xerox, a business that provides print and digital document services, said in her commencement address to students of the Georgetown University McDonough School of Business on Friday.
“You earned a degree here; you chose to come here, so now the burden is now on you. When I look at a Georgetown degree, I expect more,” Burns said. “I expect you to use this technology you have to solve potable water problems, food distribution problems, health care distribution problems.”
Dean of the MSB Paul Almeida introduced the commencement speaker before Rev. Ronald Anton, senior adviser for the MSB, delivered the invocation. University President John J. DeGioia presented Burns with an honorary Doctor of Human Letters honoris causa.
Burns grew up in the Lower East Side of New York and worked her way out of an impoverished childhood, studying mechanical engineering at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering, then Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. She pursued her master’s degree in mechanical engineering at Columbia University. Burns was named CEO of Xerox in 2009, becoming the first black female CEO of a Fortune 500 company. While she no longer leads Xerox, Burns now sits on the boards of companies like Uber and serves as the chairwoman of telephone company VEON, which primarily serves developing countries.
Burns highlighted discrimination as a central problem in today’s world and encouraged the MSB graduates to work toward building a more equitable world.
“We can’t seem to shake this issue, this idea that there’s a difference because of the way that we look, there’s a difference because of where we born, there’s a difference because of gender that we’re on, there’s a difference because of the color that we are, and I just think it’s not so,” Burns said. “I think we all know this, but we have to be really passionate about studying why and figuring out a way to solve that problem and to improve it.”
Burns asserted that technology is the tool that the younger generations can use to reshape the world and address the problem of inequality and discrimination.
“Technology is the solution,” Burns said. “Now, you have [artificial intelligence], you have the internet, you have social media, you have the ability to change the world essentially from your seats, and I want to make sure you actually understand the power and take advantage of it.”
Burns said that the MSB graduates must assume the responsibility of pushing toward positive change because of their talent, as well as the skills and opportunities they received as students at Georgetown.
“You have something that very few people in the world will ever be able to get, and that’s a college education — fewer, even, a college education from a university like this,” Burns said. “So, unfortunately, you’re talented; unfortunately, you’re getting a Georgetown degree because you’ve got to strap it on. You’re going to have to carry the world for a whole bunch of years as we go forwards.”
Warning the MSB graduates of the challenges ahead, Burns encouraged them to continue to work toward building a better world and society even though there will inevitably be setbacks.
“None of this stuff is going to be easy. It’s going to cost money and time and energy and lot of your emotions,” Burns said. “Doing good work and pushing society forward, creating a revolution can seem and feel impossible, but it is not. It isn’t easy, it’s not linear, it’s not inevitable, but you must continue.”
Burns said that the ability to overcome challenges can help enable young leaders to rise to achieve their goals.
“No matter what you pursue, there will be obstacles — big, small, devastating and inconsequential and everything in between — and the difference between you and the next guy will be how hard you are willing to persevere and to overcome,” Burns said.
After Burns gave her commencement speech, the MSB students were presented with their diplomas. Forty students graduated cum laude, 30 students graduated magna cum laude and 30 students graduated summa cum laude. The top 10 percent of the graduating class was inducted into Beta Gamma Sigma, the national scholastic honors society for business administration.
Almeida echoed Burns’ call to action for the Class of 2018 to strive to make a positive difference in the world.
“The world needs you,” Almeida said. “If you look at factors like income, wealth, life expectancy and health across the world and through history, you realize this: We are probably not just the 1 percent. We are the 1 percent of the 1 percent, and so we have a duty to make a difference.”

Despite attacks on universities’ integrity, higher learning institutions are valuable to paving the path to the future and must be supported by their communities, neuroscientist Susan Hockfield (MED ’79) said in her commencement address to the Georgetown College in McDonough Arena on Saturday.
“All of us are tempted to assume that our universities and our community institutions can stand on their own, but they cannot,” Hockfield said. “It will be your responsibility as citizens, as members of your communities, to shoulder the responsibility for defending the institutions that secure our principles and guard our society.”
Hockfield served at Yale University as dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences from 1998 to 2002 and later the provost. She went on to become the first woman and first biologist to serve as the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2004. During her tenure at MIT, Hockfield was a prominent voice in conversations about the future of U.S. energy and economic development, serving as the inaugural co-chair of the White House-led Advanced Manufacturing Partnership, a collaboration between academic leaders, government agencies and private industries.
The university awarded Hockfield an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters prior to her address.
Hockfield cited Nobel laureate Maurice Maeterlinck in her address, reminding graduates to have the courage to be innovative in the face of opposition, which was a lesson she said she learned during her time at Georgetown.
“Georgetown equipped me well to pursue my passion for scientific discovery,” Hockfield said. “I learned about the many failures that precede any success and I learned that adventuring beyond the frontier of knowledge requires not only new tools but also the courage to question received wisdom.”
Georgetown fostered this intellectual courage in its graduates through exceptional academic environments, Hockfield said.
“Georgetown’s academic leadership over decades and centuries has carefully, and deliberately, sculpted this university to make it possible for us students, you and me, to study with fantastic teachers and scholars,” Hockfield said. “They created conditions that allowed us to learn the tools that would change our lives and that would enable us to change the world.”
Through this realization, Hockfield said she found her calling to serve the next generation of students, embarking on her career in academic leadership.
“I had discovered something wonderful in this second calling,” Hockfield said. “It was the same wonderful thing that fuels scientific discovery: the intoxicating joy of thinking and working with others to find new answers and new insights. I quickly learned that great universities remain great only by constantly reinventing themselves.”
Hockfield then turned to the importance of preserving the institutions that safeguard the path to the future. She said a narrow focus on individuality leaves universities susceptible to attack.
“If we focus too intently on individuality and individual achievement, we neglect our institutions, the structures that promote community and shared purpose, and by doing so, we leave our institutions open to attack,” Hockfield said. “Indeed, the university is under attack today with rampant skepticism about the utility of higher education and, along with it, the devaluation of both expertise and the commitment to the search for truth.”
Regardless, Hockfield said she hopes graduates pursue their passions while also giving back to their universities and the communities that educated them.
“I hope you will find your calling, the path down which you can run with joy and full-hearted commitment,” Hockfield said. “But my even more fervent hope is for you to find along that path the great paradox that in doing something you love, you will also serve and support your institutions and your communities.”
