World Bank President Dr. Jim Yong Kim urged students to use their lives to advocate for the poor during the inaugural Asian Diversity Dialogue on Oct. 28.
The event was organized by Georgetown University’s Asian American Student Association and the McDonough School of Business in partnership with a number of student groups: Georgetown’s Hong Kong Student Association, Korean Student Association, Taiwanese American Student Association, Japan Network and Chinese Student Alliance. The forum connected Asian American and Pacific Islander students and professionals while encouraging conversations in leadership and diversity, according to its program.
Before he became president of the World Bank in 2012, Kim served as president of Dartmouth College after co-founding Partners in Health, a nonprofit organization that provides healthcare to the poor in developing countries.
Kim said one of the founding tenets of the organization was the idea of a “preferential option for the poor,” which calls on people and governments to prioritize the needs of the least well-off in society.
“We determined that we were just going to work in the poorest communities and try to provide healthcare, education and sometimes housing and livelihood, and we’re going to keep doing it, despite the fact that everyone in the world seems to be going against us,” Kim said.
Once an opponent of the World Bank, Kim said he learned he could still follow the guiding principles that led him into nonprofit work to enact positive change through his position in the World Bank.
“I had spent two decades prior in my career critiquing the World Bank,” Kim said. “I was actually a part of a group called ‘50 Years is Enough,’ which has the purpose of closing the World Bank.”
Kim said he understood little about finance until he became World Bank president. In his time in the position, Kim said he has learned that having a strong understanding of finance and economics is crucial to creating a real impact in developing nations.
“You cannot honestly talk about making a preferential option for the poor without understanding finance because if you don’t understand it, then almost surely, the poor will be gobbled up by the global market system,” Kim said.
Despite his start in nonprofit work, Kim said charities cannot enact change alone. For real change to take place, Kim said, government leaders must step in.
“At this point, leaders and ministers of finance have to commit to investing in people,” Kim said. “There’s just no way that more charity is going to get us there.”
AASA Treasurer Feihan Xie (MSB ’20) said he and AASA Vice President Cindy Fan (SFS ’19) saw a need for a greater presence in leadership and management positions and came up with the idea for the dialogue to encourage AAPI representation in business.
“AAPI have good representation at the entry level job in the US, but only 1.5 percent of executives are AAPI. There is a clear gap between the technical skills and human skills for AAPI individuals,” Xie wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Cindy and I came up with this year of organizing a conference specifically targeting to the AAPI community here at Georgetown to discuss the importance of leadership and giving them exposure to different industries.”
The Georgetown University Student Association senate passed a resolution Oct. 22 in support of the event, saying AAPIs are an integral part of the Georgetown community.

The Old Stone House, the oldest structure still on its original foundation in Washington, D.C., closes today to begin about one year of renovations.
The renovations will install a new fire suppression system, stabilize the building’s foundation, fix the exterior stonework and upgrade the plumbing, electrical and HVAC systems, according to the National Park Service.
Built in 1765 by a cabinetmaker as a shop and residence, the Old Stone House served as a shop and residence until 1953, when the federal government purchased the it to preserve it as a historical site following advocacy by Georgetown residents.
The NPS opened the M Street property to the public in 1960, having restored the interior of the building to its original splendor.
Georgetown historical groups support the continued preservation of the house. Peter Jost, president of the board of trustees of The Foundation for the Preservation of Historic Georgetown, said the Old Stone House is one of the most important historical sites in Georgetown.
“It’s a very important historical site. So, from our point of view, we are advocates of any kind of preservation,” he said.
Legends of the Old Stone House’s importance during the Revolutionary War saved the building from destruction before it became a recognized historical site. Rumors that George Washington stayed in the Old Stone House or used it as engineering headquarters inspired Georgetown residents to maintain original parts of the building to commemorate Georgetown’s role in founding the nation’s capital.
Washingtonians once believed that the Old Stone House was the site of Georgetown’s Fountain Inn, colloquially known as Suter’s Tavern, where Washington and urban designer Pierre L’Enfant stayed during one of their meetings to plan the layout of the District in 1791. However, historians now believe that the true Suter’s Tavern was located on the corner of 31st and K streets.
The Old Stone House actually served as a shop and residence for John Suter’s son, also John Suter, who sold clocks out of the building. The men’s shared name and familial relationship led to confusion about which structure housed Washington and led Georgetown residents to preserve the Old Stone House to memorialize the general’s supposed stay.
Even though the Old Stone House did not necessarily play a role in the founding of D.C., it is an example of pre-Revolutionary War architecture and a window into the lives of middle-class colonialists.
Jacob Schmidt, a spokesperson for the Citizens Association of Georgetown, wrote in an email to The Hoya that the CAG also commends the restoration of the Old Stone House.
“We applaud the NPS in undertaking work to preserve this artifact from the period of America’s struggle for Independence,” Schmidt wrote. “We look forward to the reopening of the Old Stone House upon completion of its restoration.”

Georgetown University plans to offer teaching licensure in 2018 for the first time after the graduate program in educational transformation received accreditation for its teaching certification programs Oct. 17.
The master of arts in educational transformation currently offers two concentrations: advocacy and policy, and learning and teaching. Accredited by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education of Washington, D.C., the learning and teaching concentration is now accepting applications for its first cohort to begin study in July 2018. The program offers certifications in secondary science and in English as a second language.
After a nearly yearlong accreditation process that began last January, Sabrina Wesley-Nero (SFS ’95), head of teacher preparation for the educational transformation program, looks forward to starting with the first learning and teaching cohort this summer.
“They’re a direct response to the needs of our community,” Wesley-Nero said about the choice of certifications.
From the 2008-2009 to the 2016-2017 academic year, D.C. reported teacher shortages in science and English as a second language, according to a 2017 Department of Education report.
The educational transformation program, launched last summer with the advocacy and policy concentration, is an interdisciplinary program that plans to eventually offer four concentrations: advocacy and policy, learning and teaching, educational design and technology and leadership and innovation.
With professors from a variety of disciplines, including biology, public policy and linguistics, among others, the program’s faculty reflect the “interdisciplinary curriculum” of the program, according to the program’s website.
While the program is interdisciplinary, its beginnings tried to build upon Georgetown’s strengths. Advocacy and policy, which launched its first class last summer, built upon Georgetown’s existing strengths in policy, according to Douglas Reed, director of the educational transformation program.
“Since we already have expertise in policy, it made sense to sort of reach out to students who want to do educational policy,” Reed said. “Learning and teaching is a bigger innovation for the university.”
Learning and teaching is at the core of the program, according to Reed, who emphasized the importance of instruction.
“One of the things we’re really, really trying to pay close attention to is to ensure that everyone who goes into advocacy and policy has a really clear understanding of what effective instruction looks like,” Reed said.
Educational advocacy and leadership is a key goal for Wesley-Nero as well.
“We’re really hoping to develop teachers who are educational leaders both inside and outside the classroom,” Wesley-Nero said.
Although advocacy and policy is a one-year program, learning and teaching will be a two-year program. The teaching certification courses, which students take in their second year in the program, extend the concentration.
All concentrations have a residency component, and learning and teaching students will be placed in D.C. public or charter schools as teaching aides. This hands-on learning is part of what makes the program special, according to Wesley-Nero.
“Our commitment to equity and social justice and commitment to experiential learning …  makes it uniquely Georgetown,” Wesley-Nero said.
According the Cawley Career Center’s First Destination Report, which surveys recent graduates, 6 percent of the class of 2016 went on to pursue careers in education. Education tied with government and health care was the industry with the fifth-highest number of graduates.
Georgetown offers an undergraduate minor in education, inquiry and justice, volunteer programs in D.C. schools through the Center for Social Justice and a master of arts in learning and design, which focuses on higher education.
For undergraduates who want to “continue within the educational field but don’t quite know how to access that,” Reed said having a graduate program with teaching certifications at Georgetown can bridge the divide.
“This can become a really fruitful way for them to take the next step in education,” Reed said.

Political journalists must push through a climate of distrust created by politicians and the public alike, argued Bob Cusack, editor-in-chief of The Hill, and Sarah Westwood, the Washington Examiner’s White House correspondent, at an event in Copley Formal Lounge on Oct. 27.
Moderated by The Hoya’s Managing Editor Jesus Rodriguez (SFS ’19), the discussion, titled “Political Journalists: Those Who Brave the Swamp,” was jointly organized by The Hoya, the Georgetown University College Democrats, the Georgetown Bipartisan Coalition and the Lecture Fund.
Cusack said his publication takes precautions to safeguard against perceived bias in political reporting when prompted by a POLITICO/Morning Consult Poll that found 46 percent of voters believe the news media fabricates stories about President Donald Trump and his administration.
“We don’t make up stories,” Cusack said. “We don’t make up sources, and if they do, a lot of journalists have been caught on that. You just have to write the news in a way that people think is fair. And sometimes that can be difficult because reporters, whether it’s right or left, do have biases, and they might write things subconsciously, especially in the heat of a presidential election year.”
Westwood said although Trump’s actions are partly responsible for the media’s heightened scrutiny of his administration, the overall objectivity of political coverage has been compromised since Trump’s campaign.
“A lot of journalists felt it was okay not to be objective when we’re talking about Trump because we were no longer talking about right and left policies, we were talking about right and wrong in the eyes of many reporters,” Westwood said. “The lines between opinion and fact got blurred, because quite frankly, we all thought Hillary Clinton was going to win, and so it didn’t really matter how we approached President Trump.”
This problem of bias persists, with media seizing opportunities to discredit the Trump administration. Westwood said.
“We have seen several instances where the media as a whole have run with narratives as it relates to President Trump that are the most negatively skewed narratives that you could possibly have,” Westwood said. “After we transitioned, the White House purged all the content on the Obama administration’s whitehouse.gov website so they could put up their own information. That’s something that happened in the digital age every transition. But it was reported in almost every major newspaper that the White House is purging the EPA website and wants to scrub climate science from the Internet.”
Cusack said the nature of news has radically changed since he joined the industry in the late 1990s. The digitization of the newsroom has introduced the need to create pre-written versions of stories for immediate release online, such as a version of an election result article in which Clinton won out over Trump.
A publication’s online presence also shifted a publication’s financing from print advertising to web advertising, Cusack said.
“We attract ads from consumers or McDonald’s, and we attract ads saying, ‘This bill is terrible, vote it down,’” Cusack said. “We are a for-profit company, so we want to make money, but we also want to do good journalism.”
To make political stories about complex policies intelligible to the public, Westwood said reporters must strive to incorporate a human element that captures how legislation will personally affect individuals nationally.
“Health care is one really great example, where there has been a lot of good reporting done looking at families that would have been affected by the repeal of Obamacare,” Westwood said. “The human element is usually important, and you can find it in every policy, but it’s important to include anecdotes from both sides of the aisle.”
Cusack said newsrooms must continue to preserve the truth rather than to preserve journalists’ egos to reestablish the public’s trust.
“You have to have principles in your newsroom of being fair, of not being snarky,” Cusack said. “A lot of time, we tell reporters, ‘Listen. You don’t need to write it with an attitude.’ You have to commit your newsroom to just writing it straight and letting readers decide one way or another.”

Amen to this and glad you are covering this mistrust issue.
I sometimes feel like this is a third world country where people have issue with trust.
