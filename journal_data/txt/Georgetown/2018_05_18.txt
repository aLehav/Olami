Even at 87 years old, Fr. Howard Gray, S.J., commanded a presence at the pulpit. The pews were packed for his sacred lecture — a Jesuit tradition — in Dahlgren Chapel last month. It was his first public appearance at Georgetown University since he retired as head of the Office of Mission and Ministry last August.
Gray launched into his April 18 lecture with his characteristic combination of gentleness and gravitas, developed over seven decades of sermonizing. His opening words were not his own but rather from a poem by Mary Oliver. He had chosen them as a fitting introduction to the theme of his lecture: how to draw goodness out of others simply by being good.
“I know a man of such mildness and kindness it is trying to change my life. He does not preach, teach, but simply is,” Gray preached to the Wednesday evening crowd. “He is kind with the sort of kindness that shines out but is resolute, not fooled. He has eaten the dark hours and could also, I think, soldier for God, riding out under the storm clouds against the world’s pride and unkindness, with both unassailable sweetness and consoling word.”
This lecture would be Gray’s last public words at Georgetown. He died Monday, May 7, at St. Joseph Mercy Oakland hospital in Pontiac, Mich., from complications from a car accident four days earlier. He was buried at All Saints Cemetery in Northfield, Ohio, his hometown, on May 12.
For those who knew Gray, his final lecture continues to echo: He is remembered by his friends as a “spiritual giant” and a “quiet leader” who set a sterling example for others to follow.
“He will be dearly missed — as a steadfast friend, extraordinary scholar, and wise leader — to many of us here at Georgetown and others throughout the Society of Jesus and institutions of higher education across our country,” University President John J. DeGioia wrote in a campuswide email May 8.
At Georgetown, Gray was a spiritual adviser to DeGioia and other senior administrators, a champion of LGBTQ inclusion and an advocate of interreligious dialogue. He also earned an international reputation as a scholar and a “guru” in Ignatian spirituality, credited with reviving the core of the Jesuit tradition with a renewed focus on individual spiritual growth and inclusivity.
———
Before coming to Georgetown in 2007, Gray was a prominent leader in the Jesuit community for decades. Gray was born in Cleveland in 1930 and joined the Society of Jesus in 1948, thereafter serving in a range of positions at Jesuit institutions during his seven decades in the society, including at Boston College, Loyola University of New Orleans and the University of Detroit Mercy.
Gray first served Georgetown as a member of the university’s board of directors from 1997 to 2006. During his term, the board oversaw the construction of several new buildings, including the Southwest Quad dormitories and Wolfington Hall, the new Jesuit residence. In 2001, the board appointed DeGioia to the post of university president as the first non-Jesuit to take the helm of any U.S. Jesuit college or university.
Gray initially expressed preference for a Jesuit to fill the presidential post, but he became a “champion of the way that lay leadership can work in Jesuit institutions,” according to Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., a Georgetown Jesuit and government professor.
“He had a sense that lay people can be leaders, and then what the Jesuit role becomes is continuing to care for the spirit of the institution,” Carnes said.
He took on this supportive role in 2007, when he joined the university’s Jesuit community as special assistant to the president. For the next decade, Gray served as a spiritual adviser to DeGioia and other senior administrators, while overseeing a number of administrative tasks, including headhunting candidates for key positions in the Office of Mission and Ministry.
As a Jesuit leader on campus, Gray championed a vision of the Jesuit identity that embraced openness and inclusion. Gray was part of a generation of Jesuits that “rediscovered the spirituality of the Jesuits” as focusing on the individual and their relationship with God — a spiritual conviction that led him to embrace diversity in a way that some others in his church did not, according to Carnes.
“Just think of the different identities that you can cherish when you cherish the individual,” Carnes said. “And that was something he did so well, and everything flowed from that.”
In 2008, Gray stood up against conservative elements in the Catholic church as a strong advocate for the founding of an LGBTQ Resource Center at Georgetown, the first of its kind at a Jesuit university in the United States. Gray’s advocacy was “instrumental” in providing the center with the moral authority it needed to get off the ground, according to Shiva Subbaraman, the center’s director.
“He always pointed out that we had an obligation to have the Center ‘because’ we are Jesuit and Catholic, not ‘despite’,” Subbaraman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Fr Howard Gray ‘saw’ LGBTQ people in all of our full range of humanity.”
In 2016, Gray accepted DeGioia’s call to lead the university’s large and complex Office of Mission and Ministry as interim vice president following the resignation of Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., to become dean of the Jesuit School of Theology at Santa Clara University. It was a demanding role, particularly with Gray’s physical health declining at the age of 86. That fall, Gray faced health episodes stemming from a heart condition, always returning to work shortly thereafter. He fulfilled the role with “incredible energy and enthusiasm” the entire year, Carnes said.
Gray embraced and promoted religious diversity at Georgetown and was particularly fascinated by interreligious dialogue: Gray was beloved by many of the university’s chaplains, Catholic and non-Catholic, whom he would often engage in theological discussion, according to colleagues. While leading the Office of Mission and Ministry, Gray welcomed Georgetown’s first full-time director of Hindu life and the first Hindu priest to be a chaplain at any U.S. university, Brahmachari Vrajvihari Sharan.
After his yearlong term heading the Office of Mission and Ministry, Gray largely retired from public life and moved to a Jesuit retreat home in West Bloomfield, Mich.
Aside from his official responsibilities, over his decade on campus, Gray frequently played the role of spiritual guide to members of the administration, faculty, student body and Jesuit community. His first-floor office in Gervase Hall, the inconspicuous brick building adjoining Isaac Hawkins Hall near Dahlgren Quad, became a chapel in its own right for members of the community seeking wisdom or support.
Gray listened closely and asked pointed questions, according to Carnes. A lover of literature and the written word, he would often provide wisdom in the form of scripture verses, lines from old novels or anecdotes from his personal life.
“He was someone who could make time for you and sit down with you and talk about the big and the small things in your life, and give you his absolute, undivided attention,” Carnes said. “And by doing that, to call out the best in you and help you bring out and see the best in yourself.”
———
Impressive as Gray was as a leader, his friends will remember him even more for who he was as a friend. While Gray was a “spiritual giant,” Fr. Gregory Schenden, S.J., said, he was also “so fully human.”
Few people were closer to Gray than Fr. John O’Malley, S.J., 90, one of his best friends of seven decades and a Georgetown theology professor. At Georgetown, the two elder Jesuits were next-door neighbors in Wolfington Hall, with Schenden on Gray’s other side.
“They would knock on each other’s doors and bug each other sometimes,” Carnes said. “The two of them could be so much fun to see together, play off one another, encourage each other and laugh at one another and themselves.”
In a sermon at Gray’s funeral Saturday, O’Malley recalled how he and Gray “bantered and teased and feigned indignation at one another’s foibles.”
“You might gather some insight into the quality of our friendship if I tell you that sometimes with me he began a conversation by asking the endearing question, ‘Do you know what’s wrong with you?’” O’Malley said.
Gray had a playful sense of humor, as well as a taste for film that extended from foreign-language dramas to slapstick comedies, and he could enjoy a drink or two: Bourbon Manhattans were his favorite, according to Schenden.
Gray often stayed in touch with old friends by sending notes and cards, usually picked up from museums or from his travels — something with an artistic flourish, and always carefully chosen for the right person and moment, according to Carnes.
Gray and his sister, Marge, were particularly inseparable: He called her nearly every day and made trips to visit her most holidays. They often told stories about their mother and how much they had learned from her as kids about teaching love and virtue by example. This lesson would be the theme of Gray’s final lecture at Georgetown, and according to his friends, the hallmark of his legacy on campus.
While Gray was in town for his lecture last month, he made sure to keep a busy schedule of dinners and other occasions to share with old friends, including meeting his old next-door neighbor Schenden for a nightcap on the evening of April 18 after his lecture.
Schenden recalled telling him, “You know, How, I didn’t realize until these days you’ve been back how spoiled I was having you here in my life each and every day.”
Gray certainly felt likewise. In a 2013 viewpoint published in The Hoya, Gray reflected on how he had learned to see his friends as “gifts to be valued.”
“Throughout our ordinary days, we are surrounded by other women and men who are gifts,” Gray wrote. “If I look back over the years, I see all the people who’ve populated my history not as a cast of characters but as good folks who taught me how to understand life, how to support others, how to laugh through my tears and sorrows, how to extend myself in compassion and care and how to forgive and be forgiven.”

A letter advocating that Georgetown University Police Department officers remain unarmed was delivered to University President John J. DeGioia’s office May 4 by student members of Georgetown United Against Police Aggression.
The GUAPA letter comes in response to another letter from a student group called GU Advocates for Responsible Defense, which called on the university to arm GUPD officers and Metropolitan Police Department officers to patrol campus while GUPD underwent firearm training. In its letter, GUARD said that GUPD officers would be better able to defend students from armed attackers if they were armed themselves, pointing to the armed security guard in a Maryland high school who recently stopped a shooting in under a minute as an example.
About 20 students joined members of GUAPA in delivering their response letter, representing the 31 student organizations that signed the letter, including the Georgetown University Student Association, the Georgetown University College Democrats and the Georgetown Solidarity Committee.
“We recognize and understand the university’s dedication to engaging with the voices and concerns of all of its students,” the letter reads. “However, as a larger representative of the student body, we stand against the demands of the 20 students earlier this month calling for the armament of GUPD and for an increase in the presence of MPD on campus. By seeking to fulfill the demands of these few students, the administration would simply threaten the safety of its workers and students.”
The group cited a history of “racial profiling and abuse of power by GUPD” as a key reason the members do not believe officers should be armed. These alleged instances of profiling, which include Georgetown community members of color being ordered to leave a building or campus area and being asked to prove that they are a Georgetown student or worker, were uncovered through community discussions facilitated by GUAPA, according to the letter.
GUAPA also cited recent instances of other schools’ campus police officers shooting and killing “students of marginalized identities” who were experiencing “psychiatric episodes,” including University of Chicago student Charles Thomas, who was shot April 3.
“In light of these facts, it is evident that equipping GUPD with guns and increasing MPD presence would only serve to increase the probability of a gun related tragedy on campus,” the letter read.
Asked for comment on GUAPA’s allegations, university spokesperson Matt Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya that Georgetown is “unaware of any of the incidents you described being reported to the university.”
GUPD Chief Jay Gruber said that “allegations of bias or harassment are taken very seriously and investigated fully” and that GUPD officers “receive extensive training in promoting community policing, combating implicit bias, and preventing discrimination.”
GUPD has partnered with the university’s LGBTQ Resource Center and the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action since 2016 to conduct implicit bias training, bias reporting training and training on transgender issues with its officers, according to a university spokesperson.
The university has not indicated whether it would or would not consider arming GUPD, but Gruber defended the current policy as consistent with the practices of other universities in the region.
“Our top priority is the safety of our community and we are constantly working to prevent violence,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our current policy follows the same model as other local institutions in the region, including George Washington University and American University. GUPD coordinates closely with MPD and regularly conducts joint drills.”
Juan Martinez (SFS ’20) and Abreham Gebre (COL’ 19) are among the students who said they have experienced racial profiling from GUPD officers. Both say they have been asked to provide proof of their status as Georgetown students while walking on campus in the past, and both know several other students of color who have experienced similar incidents.
“Two of my roommates are also men of color, and they have also experienced this,” Gebre said in an interview with The Hoya. “It’s just sad to see that we have to experience this on campus even though we go to this university.”
The question of whether to arm GUPD officers and increase MPD presence on campus also significantly affects students without documentation, according to Martinez.
“Although Georgetown is very supportive of its undocumented student community and I appreciate everything they do, something like this — like arming GUPD or bringing more MPD on campus — is concerning because it puts people of color at risk, but also other communities like the undocumented student community, which I’m a part of,” Martinez said. “So, another way of supporting undocumented students and students of color would be not passing this.”
GUAPA was founded in October 2017 as a group that organized dialogues for students to discuss their experiences of profiling and discrimination by GUPD officers and how this issue should be resolved, according to one of the founding members, Sonia Adjroud (SFS ’20). The group eventually shifted gears to take action in campus affairs, beginning with the drafting of the letter.
Looking to the future, the group hopes to stay engaged with the issue by continuing its community dialogues and starting new initiatives including “Know Your Rights” trainings, according to Adjroud.
“We want to continue to stay engaged with this issue in the fall, and we recognize that this letter is not at all even close to resolving the issue: It’s just simply the very beginning, and we want to make sure that we stay committed to this,” Adjroud said.
Correction: A previous version of this article said that Charles Thomas was killed.

What a total crock of cow manure….I am appalled at the state of my University these days and liberal pablum such as this letter to Mr. deGioia that reflects the “snowflake”, kumbaya unreality of the institution made up of its student body and faculty. GROW UP!

UChicago Alum, Georgetown Grad says

I graduated from the University of Chicago and attend Georgetown University as a graduate student. This comment may be controversial, but I truly do not mean to offend anyone and am expressing a sincere opinion. Feel free to disagree, even to attack my character if you so wish – although I feel it would not be useful to do so, but please do so after you read my entire comment. 
The shooting incident at the University of Chicago in which Charles Thomas was shot was indeed tragic, and I wish it didn’t have to happen. It was the first shot fired by a UCPD officer in decades, and I genuinely believe it was a reason why would SHOULD arm university police, and why the University police are necessary. 
First, as I mentioned, the situation is tragic. Perhaps he was failed by the university’s counseling services as well. Anyway, Thomas had a psychiatric episode and was causing extreme damage to property. Property is definitely not an offense worthy of getting shot for, but Thomas was not shot for property damage. 
As can be seen from the video, Thomas was behaving erratically and aggressively, and he visibly intended to cause a UCPD officer harm with a potentially deadly weapon. The UCPD officer, in line with his training, backed up for quite a distance (I do not know exact numbers, but it was definitely a significant distance) and try to talk the student down. Perhaps the officer could have chosen a better set of words, but that lies in the quality of de-escalation training, although I might add that de-escalation techniques may not be applicable to an individual who is behaving irrationally. I have also heard criticisms saying that it only takes common sense to back up and say drop that weapon. While it is easy to say so when in a safe, controlled environment, in high-stress situations where you have only 2 seconds to make a decision it is not quite so easy. I can give you two examples. The FBI has a training program called “Run Hide Fight” in response to active shooters. First you run to safety if you can. If you can’t, hide from the shooter. If that isn’t an option, then you fight back. This sounds easy right? In a high-stress, deadly situation such as when there is an active shooter, you don’t get more than 2 seconds to reflect on what to do before you’re shot dead. There have been people killed by active shooters literally steps away from exits because they panicked. Likewise, I had a stressful situation in college with a suicidal roommate once who ran out of the apartment in an attempt to kill himself. I then called UCPD who found him and got him mental health treatment. When I told this story to others, they were like, “why didn’t you stop him? why didn’t you ask him to come back?” etc. Well, I was in a high-stress situation for which I never trained, and I panicked. 
To continue with the Thomas case, the officer literally waited until the last second before he took one, single, non-fatal shot. Had the officer waited perhaps half a second or one second more, he may have had his head bashed in. Instead, he took a very skillful shot aimed solely at neutralizing the threat. The Chicago Police Department has had a history of human rights violations, including when Officer Jason Van Dyke shot a teenager sixteen times. Although it’s hard to make counterfactual arguments because they are, by definition, hypothetical and against the fact. But I strongly believe that had Thomas been apprehended by a Chicago city police officer, the officer may have emptied an entire clip on him. At least in this case, Thomas survived. 
Unfortunately as well, the police had to stop Thomas’s rampage. He would have done significant damage more if no one stopped him, and possibly could have hurt someone if a civilian tried to apprehend him. So, given that a police response was necessary, I think the fact that he was shot in a non-fatal manner was the “best” (I don’t use the word ‘best’ lightly) possible result, and I wish him a speedy recovery.

Five students earning the highest cumulative grade point averages across Georgetown University’s four undergraduate schools will be honored this commencement weekend as valedictorians and Dean’s Medal recipients.
Jenny Franke (COL ’18), a biochemistry major and economics minor, and Kevin Yuan (COL ’18), an economics and Japanese double major and mathematics minor, will be honored as the Georgetown College Marshals for earning the highest cumulative GPA out of all graduates. The two graduates both earned 4.0 GPAs.
Gaia Mattiace (COL ’18), a psychology and government double major with a minor in environmental studies, earned the second-highest GPA in the College. She will give the Cohongurotun address at Friday’s Tropaia ceremony, an event at which students graduating summa cum laude receive their cords.
Grace Lafaire (MSB ’18), a finance major and economics minor, is the valedictorian for the McDonough School of Business. She earned a 4.0 GPA.
Although the School of Nursing and Health Studies and the School of Foreign Service do not formally name valedictorians, they award Dean’s Medals to the graduating seniors with the highest GPA in each school. The NHS Dean’s Medal recipient is Jake Schwartz (NHS ’18), a human science major. The SFS does not announce the name of the Dean’s Medal recipient until Friday’s Tropaia ceremony.
In an interview with The Hoya, Yuan attributed his academic success to a three-pronged approach. He aimed to be diligent with his studies, have good time management skills and maintain a balance between socializing and studying.
“Having those three things together, I felt that I was able to get through everything,” Yuan said. “It allowed me to succeed more than I would have if I had just been working 24/7.”
Franke echoed the value of a life-work balance, recalling going to The Tombs with her friends every Wednesday as a highlight of her senior year. Her friends provided a support system and played a role in her academic success, Franke said.
Although having supportive friends helped her through her time at Georgetown, Franke noted that taking classes in topics she enjoys benefitted her academically.
“I think that I really enjoyed the material I was learning,” Franke said. “A big part of that was having really great, passionate professors who were so accessible.”
Despite earning straight A’s every semester, Franke did not set out with the intention to graduate with a 4.0 GPA: her passionate professors and enjoyable classes inspired her academic performance.
“Throughout college I didn’t really make it a goal or anticipate having a 4.0,” Franke said. “It just kind of happened every semester.”
However, she worked hard during her final semester to maintain her motivation to complete the feat, Franke said.
Schwartz attributed his academic success to his love for his major, which NHS students must declare when they enter the university as freshmen. He came to Georgetown for the human science major, and his academic studies defined his college years.
“I feel like different people make different things their main passion at Georgetown,” Schwartz said. “The thing that I really wanted to excel at was just school — I like to learn.”
In addition to his academic achievements, Schwartz also studied abroad in Argentina, where he volunteered in pediatric clinics and conducted research on the Holocaust with Fr. Patrick Desbois, S.J., the president of Yahad-In Unum, an organization that works to raise awareness about the sites of Jewish and Roma mass executions by Nazi killing in Eastern Europe during World War II, according to the organization’s website.
Yuan also pointed to his study abroad experience as a defining part of his time at Georgetown. Yuan studied abroad at Waseda University in Tokyo for his entire junior year and plans to return to Japan on a Critical Language Scholarship through the U.S. Department of State after graduation.
After graduation, Schwartz and Franke will be attending medical school at McGill University and Johns Hopkins University, respectively.
While Schwartz is “honored and humbled” to be this year’s NHS Dean’s Medal recipient, he pointed out the diverse variety of student achievement at Georgetown that goes beyond just grade point averages.
“I think that GPA is only one way of rating academic success,” Schwartz said. “I think that many people who don’t have this GPA have learned just as well and just as much.”

The Team USA Awards Ceremony, hosted at the Duke Ellington School of the Arts northeast of campus April 26, recognized Winter Olympic and Paralympic athletes for their outstanding performances at the 2018 games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.
Awards were given in eight categories, and the winners were determined by online fan voting and representatives from the Olympic and Paralympic committees.
Athletes and guests entered the venue on a red carpet before the awards show, emceed by NBC sportscaster Mike Tirico. A Duke Ellington senior kicked off the awards ceremony with the national anthem, after which a film of highlights from the Olympics played for the audience.
Prominent figures presented awards, including White House adviser Ivanka Trump and professional wrestler Mr. T.
The U.S. Olympic Committee has organized the Team USA Awards ceremony since 1974.
The women’s hockey team and the sled hockey team were honored for their contributions in team sports at the winter games. Tom Kelly, vice president of communications for the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association, received the USG Building Dreams Award for outstanding contributions to Team USA, and Kristi Yamaguchi, a two-time Olympic silver medalist in figure skating, accepted the Jesse Owens Olympic Spirit Award for her work promoting early childhood literacy worldwide through the creation of the Always Dream Foundation, a program passed in 2012 to increase the availability of reading materials for children.
Yamaguchi said in her acceptance speech that her success at the Olympics combined with the influence of her family inspired her to turn to philanthropy.
“That realization of fulfilling a lifelong dream is something that I feel so fortunate and grateful for every single day,” Yamaguchi said in her acceptance speech. “I feel like I focused on my own goals for so long, and of course I was excited to finally reach that at the age of 20, and then my mother’s question right after the Olympics: ‘What are you going to do to give back?’”
Snowboarders Chloe Kim and Shaun White, as well as Nordic skiers Oksana Masters and Dan Cnossen, were all recognized for their individual athletic contributions to Team USA in the Olympics and Paralympics; Gary Colliander and Jason Cork were recognized for their coaching contributions in Nordic skiing and cross country skiing, respectively.
Cnossen, a former Navy SEAL and 2018 Male Paralympic Athlete of the Games, said that teamwork and friendship drew him and many other veterans to the Paralympics.
“I think overall, it’s the camaraderie with the team,” Cnossen said during his acceptance speech. “After being in the military, a lot of the veterans have found the program to be quite meaningful. I think what it comes down to is teamwork. And that’s what we see, and what we love, and what keeps us doing this.”
Before the ceremony, U.S. women’s hockey team captain Megan Duggan expressed her pride in her team’s growth after the Olympics in Sochi, Russia, in 2014, where the team placed second after losing in an overtime shootout to Canada. The team won gold in Pyeongchang this year.
“One of the biggest things I would say is we looked [at] ourselves in the mirror and asked ourselves questions like, ‘Why have we come up short of our ultimate goal? And what are we made of?’” Duggan said in an interview with The Hoya. “And when we were able to answer these questions and really challenge each other, day in and day out, on and off the ice, mentally, physically, we were able to get closer to getting our goal of winning the gold medal.”
Duggan said that the success of her team helped bring the sport into the spotlight and changed hockey in the United States by inspiring more girls to join teams.
“I think that it has really changed our sport in this country, and it will continue, and you look at numbers of girls that are registering for the sport, and the numbers are skyrocketing, and we take great pride in that,” Duggan said.

A record 30 Georgetown University students, including 19 graduating seniors, are set to receive Fulbright scholarships to pursue individual research and English language teaching fellowships around the world this year.
The total number of grant recipients this year tops last year’s 27 and is set to place Georgetown in the top five U.S. institutions to produce Fulbright scholars this year. Fulbright scholars receive federal funding in the form of grants to study abroad after graduation, conduct individual research, pursue master’s degrees or teach English in foreign countries.
Every year, around 100 Georgetown students participate in the yearlong application process. Competition varies on the country selected for foreign study, and the fellowship is not limited to students with certain GPAs, according to Lauren Tuckley, senior associate director of the Office of Fellowships, Awards and Resources.
Created in 1946 by President Harry Truman and Senator J. William Fulbright after World War II, the Fulbright Program is the U.S. government’s flagship international education exchange program, according to the Fulbright website.
The Fulbright U.S. Student Program, which oversees exchange programs for students and young professionals, currently awards 1,900 grants in all areas of study and operates programs in more than 140 countries. Fulbright scholars can either conduct research, pursue a master’s degree or teach abroad.
The Georgetown Office of Fellowships, Awards, and Resources oversees Georgetown’s Fulbright application process, connecting second-semester juniors and seniors to faculty volunteers and advisers throughout the yearlong process.
Tuckley said Georgetown consistently performs well in securing Fulbright fellowships.
“The Fulbright is our signature program here in the Office of Fellowships because there is an enormous interest and it’s a really good fit for the typical Georgetown student,” Tuckley said in an interview with The Hoya. “We estimate we will be in the top five [of Fulbright-producing institutions], but we will be in the next few years, number one. That is the goal.”
Tuckley said the Fulbright program’s lack of a minimum GPA requirement is meant to encourage well-rounded applicants with genuine passion for research or teaching in the countries they choose.
“This is not something that’s just looking to find your 4.0s; this is looking for someone with a genuine cultural interest to identify an academic goal either through teaching or through research or through study and to say, ‘This would be a meaningful experience to me and I want to go abroad and make the most of it,’” Tuckley said. “That is the winning formula. Anybody that has an interest in going abroad — bring me anybody; I can find them Fulbright.”
Tuckley and Laura Perille, GOFAR’s associate director, provide students information, advising and connections to faculty advisers beginning in January. They continue to provide interest sessions, study breaks and newsletter updates throughout the spring and summer until the Sept. 1 Georgetown deadline for students to submit their application materials, including personal statements and grant requests.
“One of the substantive things that the office can do for students on an individual advising basis is to help them to identify the goal of what they want to do with their Fulbright year and then help them understand the very nature of the competition so that they can have their academic goals and their cultural exchange goals met, and at the same time identify the most likely competition for that individual to compete in,” Tuckley said.
Haley Florsheim (SFS ’18) won a Fulbright teaching fellowship to teach English in Brazil after completing a Latin American studies certificate and international politics major, for which Florsheim researched and wrote a thesis on legislative progress on preventing violence against women and securing reproductive rights in Argentina, Brazil and Chile.
“You know, speaking of academic experiences here at Georgetown — that was by far the most rewarding academic experience that I have had, and it was just absolutely fantastic,” Florsheim said in an interview with The Hoya. “I was lucky enough to work with some really great professors, which made a huge difference, and I think that I owe a lot of that experience to their support and guidance and just their enthusiasm for the program and my personal project.”
Florsheim said her personal background motivated her to attain proficiency in Spanish and Portuguese, leading her to choose Brazil as her focus country.
“As a 6-year-old I had Spanish in my public school, which doesn’t exist anymore due to budget cuts, unfortunately. But that literally shaped my interests in the way that I saw myself in the world just because from an early age, you know, growing up in Wisconsin, you feel sort of far from other countries,” Florsheim said. “When I got to Georgetown, those sort of experiences I guess collectively culminated in my decision to attend Georgetown and to study international politics.”
Sarah Mack (SFS ’18), who won a fellowship to conduct research in Yanji, China, on how Koreans in China express their identity through language, said her personal background played a role in her Fulbright application process as well.
“Before I came to Georgetown I was a high school exchange student in South Korea, and while I was there I became really interested in North Korea,” Mack said in an interview with The Hoya. “I came across professor Victor Cha’s book ‘The Impossible State.’ He became my hero and I was obsessed with and I had to take his class.”
But Mack noted the stronger role her extracurricular involvement played in cementing her academic interests.
“Surprisingly, the big thing that had the biggest impact on my career was actually not that class or that professor or any professor really, but a small group that we have at Georgetown called Georgetown THiNK, or Truth and Human Rights in North Korea,” Mack said. “I’ve been the president of that club for two years, and, like, most of the connections that I have, I met through a club with, like, a really small budget.”
Tuckley said this intersection of personal and academic interests makes the best Fulbright scholars.
“The mission is so important to the scholarship and the award in that it was designed in 1946 after the Second World War with the idea that we would be a better nation if we had individuals with a greater degree of interaction with otherness, with people from other cultures, so that in some ways we become more informed and tolerant individuals,” Tuckley said. “To bring that sensibility back to the United States is what this program is about.”
Mack said she hopes current students are encouraged to apply, regardless of how their Georgetown experiences have gone.
“If at first you don’t succeed, apply, apply again. Just keep applying until you get something. I had a really hard time at Georgetown, especially my first year; I felt like I wasn’t supposed to be here, I felt like kind of stuck and like I was a loser, but I also found my place. I know a lot of freshmen might be in that place right now,” Mack said. “It’s about believing yourself.”

Award recipients advocated for better health care and support to transgender and gender non-conforming students and reflected on their own identities as part of the LGBTQ community at Georgetown University’s 10th annual Lavender Graduation, at which LGBTQ members of the Class of 2018 were honored April 26.
Hosted in the Healey Family Student Center by Georgetown’s LGBTQ Center, the graduation honored members and allies of the LGBTQ community for advocacy and work for promoting LGBTQ rights. Pamela Chen (LAW ’86), a federal district judge for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, gave the keynote address, in which she reflected on her experiences in law school, when Georgetown was in the middle of a “gay rights battle.”
“In 1980, several gay student groups sued the university for equal access to campus resources. The case was winding its way through the courts, minutes away from the law school,” Chen said. “The year after I graduated, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled that Georgetown gay student groups were entitled to equal access to university resources but that the university did not have to officially recognize them. We are certainly far from those days.”
Chen came out publicly in her early 30s after she had already entered her professional career and was on track to become a judge. Chen said although she was labeled as a “lesbian role model” for so many LGBTQ youth, she still found herself navigating her own identity.
“The confirmation process that I went through to become a judge was the first time I ever had to think about my separate identities – Asian-American, female, gay – in a holistic way,” Chen said. “I had to figure out what it all meant. As an Asian-American, I’ve always understood that one’s identity is defined both internally and externally. For me, my identity as an Asian-American was for a long time defined externally – by the world around me and how others perceived me.”
Chen said her identity as a gay woman has had many different implications than her identity as an Asian-American.
“All of my life, people made assumptions about me based on my being Asian, but being gay is something the outside world has never imposed on me, or identified me as, until I came out,” Chen said. “On a day-to-day basis, being gay is such a different identity than being Asian. I’ve always been visibly Asian: I’ve never had to announce it or mention it. Being identified as gay, by contrast, requires an affirmative declaration. There’s a reason they call it coming out. You have to self-report; you have to self-identify.”
Zack Frial (SFS ’18), Luiggy Vidal (COL ’18), Grace Smith (COL ’18) and Laura Padilla Pérez (COL ’18) were the undergraduate award winners for their advocacy efforts on campus and beyond. Dean Samuel Aronson and professor Dana Luciano were also recognized for their commitment to the LGBTQ community. Award winners from the Georgetown University Law Center comprised Charlie Gilfoil (LAW ’18) and professor Judith Perez Cara, while Casey Bishop (MED ’18) represented the Georgetown University School of Medicine.
Frial, who was awarded the LGBTQ Leadership Beyond the Gates award, spoke to their experience coming out at Georgetown.
“For many of us, college is the first chance we have not only to come out, but to come in – as we reflect on who we want to be,” Frial said. “Despite my wanting to accept myself as a whole person, the world is still not ready to accept me. Georgetown is not ready to accept me. I turn the question on you now: Is this Georgetown who you want to be?”
Frial said their lack of faith in Georgetown’s administration stemmed from the lack of resources available to transgender and gender non-conforming students.
“We need health care, access to the mental health services, hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries,” Frial said. “We need administration and other students on campus in GU Pride, in GU Queer People of Color, in reproductive justice groups – to recognize this. In the name of cura personalis – care for the whole person – will Georgetown come in once more and make the next step to care for its transgender students?”
Chen said that Georgetown has, however, advanced greatly in its treatment of its LGBTQ students, attributing this progress in part to student activism and student advocacy groups.
In a final piece advice for the graduating members of the LGBTQ community, Chen encouraged them to be free and comfortable in their identities while venturing forward in the world.
“One should live as openly and proudly as you can – whenever and wherever,” Chen said. “Just as the fact as my presence on the bench as an openly gay judge helps brings down stereotypes and barriers, so too does your act of living your life authentically and openly.”

Georgetown’s admissions yield for the Class of 2022 reached 51 percent, the highest in recent memory, following a record-low acceptance rate and an all-time high in applications submitted to the university.
The university’s admissions yield refers to the number of admitted students who paid the May 1 enrollment deposit and plan to attend Georgetown in the fall.
Out of the 3,327 students admitted from an applicant pool of 22,897 students, 1,700 students paid enrollment deposits, according to Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (CAS ’64, GRD ’69). This year’s rate is a marginal increase from last year’s 49 percent.
After the Office of Undergraduate Admissions increased its target enrollment for the class of 2021 by 20 spots, raising the overall enrollment to 1,600, the target enrollment remained at 1,600 for the Class of 2022.
The admissions office received 22,897 regular decision applications to the Class of 2022, up from the 21,459 applicants Georgetown received in 2017. Georgetown accepted 3,327 students, a record-low 14.5 percent of applicants.
The university plans to only admit waitlisted students for the School of Nursing and Health Studies, Deacon said.
The university anticipated an enrollment of around 1,580 students, Deacon said. Because of the unexpectedly high yield, the current number of students enrolled in each of the undergraduate schools exceeds the target number, except for in the NHS.
Students will be taken from the waitlist to fill the remaining spots in the NHS to ensure it reaches the enrollment goal of 115 students, according to Deacon.
All other applicants were either released from the waitlist or remain on it, despite the lack of available spaces, Deacon said.
“We let a few people who really wanted to hang in there, to stay on a very short waiting list, about 15 or so, but we’ve told them there’s virtually no chance there’s going to be any spaces,” Deacon said in an interview with The Hoya.
The total size of the student body is tied to the campus plan passed in 2017, a 20-year agreement between the university and local residents that caps the number of enrolled undergraduate students to 6,675.
The admissions office will have to reduce the number of admitted transfer students to account for the greater number of incoming freshmen, Deacon said. Previously set at 125 students, the target number of transfer admissions may be reduced to 100, according to Deacon. Transfer students are accepted on a rolling basis.
“Right now, because we have to be within the enrollment cap, we are essentially holding on transfer admissions,” Deacon said. “We are putting a moratorium on any further admits until we see where we are in the middle part of June at which point we may be able to offer a few more transfer admits.”
Twenty-three students have already requested to defer enrollment, and based on yield rates in previous years, Deacon said the university anticipates around 30 students in total will take a gap year, and 50 others will withdraw for other reasons. Deacon anticipates the Class of 2022 will ultimately reach its target enrollment size through the process of attrition.
“Historically, about 45 to 50 students will ultimately withdraw from their deposit either getting off a waiting list elsewhere or some personal circumstances,” Deacon said. “We’re only in the beginning of that process so we’re hoping that happens — normally we hate to see that happen — our best guess is it might bring us back to around 1,620.”
Deacon said this year’s applicants had substantially higher test scores than previous classes, with the incoming average SAT scores increasing about 30 points from last year’s average of 1411.
“The average student admitted was about a 1460 on the SAT, and the average coming in is about 1440,” Deacon said. “That’s the highest it has ever been so that’s one indicator that we’re getting stronger students. We’re also getting the same diversity in terms of first generation and ethnicity and those students are coming in with stronger scores as well.”
The incoming class represents 185 black students, up 13 from last year. The number of foreign nationals increased to 137 students, around 8 percent of the incoming class, from last year’s 125.
The undergraduate schools reported steady yields, with the exception of Georgetown College, which saw an increase of about 3 percent from 45 percent to 48 percent. The School of Foreign Service reported a 50 percent yield, the NHS recorded a 50 percent yield and the McDonough School of Business yielded 55 percent of applicants.
The increase in the College’s yield may be attributed to a shift in the applicants’ interest for the humanities and social sciences, according to Deacon.
“The biggest percentage increase was the College, which is usually the lowest of yields,” Deacon said. “That would be an indication that students in the humanities and social sciences are saying yes at a higher rate.”
Deacon said the overall increases in applicants may be due to a desire to live in Washington, D.C.
“There may be something going on that is causing Washington to be a much more appealing place to come. For the first time in maybe 30 years, we’re seeing indications that in this generation overall, there is more interest in being more active in your future,” Deacon said. “Students are saying, ‘I want to get in there where the action is.’”
Correction: A previous version of this article said the admissions yield was 50% and that 1,649 students accepted their admissions offer.

Three civil rights groups are accusing the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department of violating the Neighborhood Engagement Achieves Results Act, which mandates every police officer to record any interactions with residents to prevent racial bias incidents.
Black Lives Matter D.C., the Stop Police Terror Project D.C. and the American Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit May 4 stating that the department’s failure to record the data violates the NEAR act, passed by the D.C. Council in 2016. One provision of the act requires officers to keep detailed information about every police stop, including the gender and race of the person stopped, as well as the reason for the search and whether an arrest resulted.
“Almost two years have passed since the D.C. Council passed a statute mandating that defendants collect this essential data,” the 12-page complaint says. “However, the D.C. government has dragged its feet, indicating at best recalcitrance and at worst and institutional antipathy towards the law.”
The groups are asking the D.C. Superior Court to order Mayor Muriel Bowser (D), MPD Chief Peter Newsham and Deputy Mayor for Public Safety and Justice Kevin Donahue to enforce the provision related to stop and frisk data collection.
The data is critical to detecting and preventing potential racial bias by officers, according to a leading organizer of Black Lives Matter D.C. branch April Goggans.
“This data collection is necessary to enable the community to hold D.C. accountable for what its police are doing on the streets, particularly if the data matches what we experience every day: That MPD is disproportionately stopping people of color, especially black people,” Goggans said in a May 8 press release published by the ACLU. “This lawsuit is the first, necessary step in the fight for fair treatment of all who live in the District.”
The inaction of the District is an affront to police transparency and accountability, according to executive director of the ACLU of D.C. Monica Hopkins.
“Mayor Bowser has abdicated her duty to follow the law. By stalling, then making excuses for not collecting this critical data, she has sent the message that police transparency and accountability are not D.C. values,” Hopkins said in the May 8 statement. “It leaves us no choice but to ask the court to compel the mayor to enforce a law she’s sworn to uphold.”
The lawsuit came after the civil rights groups requested information and records on two different police stops in February and March. The District failed to produce documents of the interactions, however, and did not provide a plan to enforce the stop and frisk data requirement.
On March 29, the day after the second demand letter was sent, Chief Newsham admitted at a D.C. Council budget meeting that his department is “guilty” of not implementing the law.
“To the extent there has been a delay to this data piece and not a complete understanding of the necessary infrastructure changes that would be required, we’re guilty,” Newsham said at the meeting.
The budget allocated to funding the stop and frisk data collection law is not sufficient to cover the technical costs of achieving full implementation, according to Donahue.
“Right away, the MPD IT folks looked at that and recognized when they looked at the requirements of the NEAR Act and those elements that $150,000 simply wasn’t enough to get it done,” Donahue said in an interview with WUSA9.
Despite the complaints, MPD claims to be working on improving its data collection efforts to effectively record all police encounters.
“The work of reviewing the data and sorting it into “usable” content is both laborious and costly,” MPD wrote in an email to WUSA9. “MPD continues its efforts to find a workable solution to providing the data in a manner that is consistent with the intent of the legislation.”

The School of Foreign Service in Qatar graduated its 10th cohort May 3, in a commencement service featuring main campus faculty and members of the Qatari royal family.
Fifty-one students received a Bachelor of Science in foreign service, the same degree that students at the main Georgetown University campus School of Foreign Service receive.
This year’s commencement follows last year’s graduating class of 62 students. The graduating class consisted of 36 men and 15 women from 22 countries.
The class joins 440 SFS-Q alumni who have graduated since the campus opened in 2005.
Aysha Al-Mudahka, CEO of the business incubator Qatar Business Incubation Center, delivered the commencement address. Al-Mudahka also serves on the board of education nonprofit INJAZ Qatar.
Graduates must work to promote diversity and inclusion in a changing world, Al-Mudahka said.
“Today, when insularity and indifference are flaunted like virtues, I call upon you to keep building bridges, with both compassion and dignity,” Al-Mudahka said. “In the long run, no reprisal retaliation is sweeter than saying this: ‘We never gave up.’”
University President John J. DeGioia travelled to Qatar along with other members of university leadership for the commencement exercises.
This year’s commencement exercises were SFS-Q Dean Ahmad Dallal’s first as SFS-Q dean, following the start of his term Sept. 1, 2017.
The students are graduating at a unique point in history, Dallal said.
“The Class of 2018 is graduating at a remarkable time in history in a rapidly transforming world, but they have the benefit of a Georgetown education that has prepared them to deal with the challenges of today and to contribute and help shape a positive future,” Dallal said.
