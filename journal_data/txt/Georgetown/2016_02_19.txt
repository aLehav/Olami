Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and Chris Fisk (COL ’17) won the 2016 Georgetown University Student Association executive election Friday afternoon, the first election in GUSA history with only one official ticket on the ballot. 
The election results — which will be certified by the GUSA senate at 5 p.m. Sunday — were released 15 hours later than usual by the GUSA Election Commission, which cited procedural issues that questioned the election’s integrity as cause for the delay.
Khan said she is excited for the year ahead.
“I’m so happy, so thankful, this is the best group of people possible and honestly I’m so excited for things this team is going to be doing for the next year,” Khan said. “We’re so excited, and hopefully everything goes smoothly on Sunday. We’re beyond thrilled.”
Fisk said he and Khan plan to work together with other campaigns and underrepresented groups on campus to make meaningful change.
“We’re excited to work together. There’s so much that needs to get done at Georgetown, and if we all work together we can make a big big impact here,” Fisk said.
The Khan-Fisk ticket received 48.8  percent of the vote — 1165 total votes — in the first round of the election, and 57.9 percent of the vote — 1383 total votes — in the third and final round of the election. 
The write-in ticket of the Wisemiller’s Hot Chick and Chicken Madness sandwiches came second, with 725 total votes in the first round and 878 votes in the final round. 
The write-in ticket of Reed Howard (SFS ’17) and Courtney Maduike (SFS ’17) placed third, with 440 votes in the first round and 454 votes in the second round, followed by write-in candidates Maddy Moore (SFS ’17)  and Scott Lowder (COL ’17) who placed fourth with 58 votes.
Thirty-three percent of the undergraduate student body voted in the election, with voter turnout totaling 2,388, markedly lower than the 3,637 votes in 2015 and the all-time election record of 3,733 votes in 2013.
GUSA Election Commissioner Alden Fletcher (SFS ’17) said the delay was caused by a procedural error related to the five write-in ballots, and that the issue would be brought to the senate on Sunday during certification. 
“We thought that considering this error related to the executive ballot we wait for publishing results,” Fletcher said. “Upon further advice and consent from other relevant bodies in GUSA, that being the Constitutional Council, some members of the senate and the exec, we essentially decided that the best course would be to publish the results as they are and then the procedural issue is going to be brought up in the senate vote on certification this coming Sunday.”
The results were announced at 5 p.m. Friday, and were live-tweeted by the GUSA Election Commission over the course of 20 minutes.
The final results were similar to the results of The Hoya’s 2016 poll, which placed Khan and Fisk as winners with 38.46 percent of likely voters supporting them.
This year’s GUSA executive election cycle began at midnight on Feb. 4, with voting beginning at 10 p.m. Wednesday and ended when voting completed at 12:05 a.m. Friday.
Khan and Fisk, who ran backed by campaign manager Alex Bobroske (SFS ’17) and a campaign team of over 200 students — one of the largest in GUSA history — received endorsements from the editorial boards of The Hoya and The Georgetown Voice.
The Khan-Fisk campaign ran on a 23-issue, comprehensive platform that highlighted inclusivity, restructuring GUSA and socio-economic issues as the principal issues of its campaign.
Early priorities for the Khan-Fisk ticket include addressing campus dining quality and contract options, the new D.C. policing bill, which would allow Georgetown University Police Department to patrol off campus, and the campus plan. 
Howard and Maduike, led by Bserat Ghebremicael (MSB ’17), launched their campaign late in the election, formally announcing via a social media campaign and informal town hall in the Former Jesuit Residence on Monday. 
Howard and Maduike ran on a one-page platform focused on college affordability, race issues at Georgetown and the campus plan. 
Howard and Maduike’s college affordability platform focused on increasing university transparency about where tuition money is spent, while their race platform targeted reforming the manner in which Counseling and Psychiatric Services approaches and serves minority groups. 
The campaign’s campus plan policies included creating a new Georgetown Community Partnership group dedicated to on-campus improvements, which would bring students, administrators and neighbors together to improve campus life. 
Howard and Maduike petitioned the Constitutional Council on Sunday to allow them to be placed on the ballot, claiming the GUSA Election Commission does not have the authority to set deadlines for registration forms and that the GUSA bylaws do not require candidates to attend mandatory information sessions to receive registration forms. The Constitutional Council ruled against them Tuesday. 
The Constitutional Council on Wednesday instructed the Election Commission to include five write-in slots on the ballot instead of one, following a petition by Howard and Maduike. 
Hot Chick and Chicken Madness, led by translator Anirudha Vaddadi (SFS ’16), ran a satirical write-in ticket throughout the campaign, without any formal policy.
Moore and Lowder both served in GUSA this year. Moore was the GUSA Secretary of Student Safety, while Lowder was a “What’s a Hoya?” coordinator.

In other words, Georgetown has reverted to single party rule, narrowly beating a sandwich. Real nice angle in the article btw.

I’d be curious to see the raw voting data released. Did GUSA end up counting misformatted but readable write-ins that didn’t adhere to the preposterous syntax they required on the ballot? This single party election was such a farce from the beginning it would not surprise me if some of the write-ins actually won in a democractic sense but lost with respect to GUSA insider politics.
Expect more of the same from GUSA this year. Students should make it clear that whatever GUSA tells the administration is not at all representative of the wishes of the student body.

Jobbo'18 says 
February 21, 2016 at 1:49 am
Will the election commission post the results?  Will The Hoya and The Voice launch and indepednent review to see whether or not votes which should have been counted for Hot Chick and Chicken Madness were discarded because of spelling or formatting errors?
Oh yeah, and congratulations to Enushe and Chris for beating two sandwiches.

HoyaSaxa says 
February 21, 2016 at 8:44 pm
Election Commission confirmed today that they counted write-ins based on INTENT not format or spelling. so if someone voted for “read and kourtney” instead of “reed and courtney” it would still count towards Reed and Courtney. They hand counted all write ins poor kids

Law professor Gary Peller is a fascist bigot. I don’t agree with most of Scalia’s opinions but he represents a legitimate thread of the tapestry of American opinion and each thread deserves a voice. Perhaps Prof. Peller would be more comfortable in a country like North Korea where everyone must hold the same opinion on pain of death.

The Georgetown University Student Association Election Commission postponed the release of the 2016 GUSA executive election results Friday, citing procedural issues that questioned the integrity of the election.
The race, which included the ticket of Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and Chris Fisk (COL ’17) as the only ticket on the official ballot after the ticket of Tony Pezzullo (MSB ’17) and A.J. Serlemitsos (COL ’17) dropped out on Feb. 9, was contested by the write-in campaigns of Reed Howard (SFS ’17) and Courtney Maduike (SFS ’17) and the joke ticket of the Wisemiller’s Hot Chick and Chicken Madness sandwiches.
More than 33 percent of the undergraduate student body voted in the 2016 election, a total of around 2,500 voters. GUSA Election Commissioner Minji Doh (SFS ’19) was unable to confirm the official number of voters as of press time.
The 2016 election also included a referendum that asked students to vote between the current system of pre-registration and live registration, which resulted in 83 percent of students favoring the current system of pre-registration, 7 percent of students favoring live registration and 9 percent selecting no preference.
This year’s voter turnout of 33 percent is markedly lower than the 51 percent of students who voted last year, with 3,637 votes cast in the 2015 GUSA election, and 3,733 votes in 2013, an all-time election record.
The 2016 executive election is the first time in recent memory that a ticket has run unopposed on the official election ballot and the first time since 2008 that the Election Commission has delayed the release of election results. In the 2008 GUSA election, the Election Commission refused to certify the race’s results, resulting in a run-off election that determined the winning candidates.
According to Doh, the results of the election may be released after a special session of the GUSA senate on Friday or Saturday, where the procedural issues that the Election Commission raised will be presented.
“We’re not telling the senate our results when we’re going into the briefing. We’re getting checked on our procedures, and then if they say it’s okay then will release them right away,” Doh said.
Doh said the commission’s decision to delay the release of the results, which was made Thursday afternoon, was made to ensure that the election followed GUSA’s bylaws.
“We will be counting votes today but we will not be releasing results, and we will not tell the senate either,” Doh said. “The decision was made today, and we decided among ourselves to wait for the Senate’s hearing.”
GUSA Election Commissioner Grady Willard (SFS ’18) said that although the commissioners would not specify the procedural issues in question, the 2016 race’s inclusion of multiple write-in tickets may have influenced the procedural details of the election.
“Rather than get into the specifics, we would rather have the senate decide and make it a little fairer than us deciding,” Willard said. “It’s just different in the fact that there was one set of candidates who filed and there were many write-ins.”
Khan and Fisk, led by campaign manager Alex Bobroske (SFS ’17) and a campaign team of over 200 students — one of the largest in GUSA history — received endorsements from the editorial boards of The Hoya and The Georgetown Voice.
The Khan-Fisk ticket campaigned on a 23-issue, comprehensive platform that highlighted inclusivity, restructuring GUSA and socio-economic inclusion as the principal topics of their campaign. If elected, early priorities for the Khan-Fisk ticket include addressing campus dining quality and contract options, as well as campus planning and the D.C. Policing Bill that would extend the Georgetown University Police Department’s jurisdiction to outside the front gates.
The Howard-Maduike ticket, led by campaign manager Bserat Ghebremicael (MSB ’17), announced its write-in campaign Monday through social media and an informal town hall.
Howard and Maduike decided to run in response to news that the race was uncontested and that Khan would be in New York over the summer interning for Goldman Sachs, preventing Khan from fulfilling her presidential duties to stay on campus to interact with administrators and negotiate the campus plan.
Howard and Maduike appealed unsuccessfully to the Election Commission and GUSA Constitutional Council to be placed on the official ballot. The Howard-Maduike campaign focused on three core issues: college affordability, race issues on the Hilltop and advocacy on behalf of students on the 2017-2037 Campus Plan.
On Thursday — in response to a second petition from Howard and Maduike — the GUSA Constitutional Council ruled to include five write-in slots on the ballot, which in years past has only included one slot for write-in candidates.
GUSA Constitutional Council Chief Justice Josh Shinbrot (COL ’16) said that the unique circumstances of the 2016 election necessitated the addition of extra write-in slots.
“A ballot with one write-in slot would have severely limited student choice,” Shinbrot wrote in a message to The Hoya on Wednesday. “Given the ambiguity of the bylaws, the [Constitutional Council] chose to protect choice and instruct the [Election Commission] to add more write-in slots.”
Khan said the addition of five write-in slots to the ballot might have prompted the Election Commission’s decision Friday to delay the release of election results.
“I think it’s no surprise because there were five write-in slots. But this doesn’t change anything for us, we’re just happy to be together,” Khan said.
According to GUSA bylaw sections 14.03 and 13.14, the Election Commission is strongly suggested to report the results of the election the day after, but must report the results within 72 hours of the election’s conclusion. Additionally, the GUSA senate is required to confirm the results of the selection with a two-thirds majority, or vote for a new election to be held within two weeks.
In reaction to the postponement of election results, Howard said students should explore the reasons behind his and Maduike’s candidacy.
“I think Georgetown students are going to be much more interested in looking into the reasons behind why there was only one ticket, why another ticket decided to get into the race so late so that Georgetown students could have a viable credible alternative.”
Howard also questioned the validity of a senate confirmation on the results of the election, citing Khan’s position as speaker of the senate as a source of contention.
“I think it’s interesting that the senate would have to affirm the results of the election and Enushe is the speaker of that body, and everyone including the vice speaker has an incentive for them to win the election,” Howard said. “When we’re looking at the fairness in all of this, we have to consider the fact that institutionally everything points to favor Enushe. And I think that there are some significant problems with that.”
Maduike said the current election system places students who are not involved with GUSA at a disadvantage.
“These GUSA elections are skewed in favor of people who are already GUSA insiders. The way that the system is set up is not welcoming or easy for students outside of this GUSA system to fairly and effectively break in and bring in more voices like so many candidates have been saying for the past however many years,” Maduike said. “I think that’s something important to consider moving forward: that perhaps it’s the system itself that is broken, not the individuals making it so.”
Maduike also said write-in candidates, like her and Howard, were at a fundamental disadvantage because of the election commissioner’s rules.
“Write-in candidates were systematically disadvantaged from so-called ‘official candidates,’” Maduike said. “Any candidate who wants to exercise their right to be a leader on this campus, if they put in the work and they present themselves well, should not be disadvantaged just because of traditions and arbitrary rules that were set up that aren’t found in the bylaws.”
Howard also noted that specific formatting rules in voting may have prevented some write-in votes from being counted.
“The reason that I’m upset about the write-in formatting rules is that they’re gonna throw out votes from students who were just trying to have their voice represented, but might have misspelled a name or might have formatted something incorrectly,” Howard said. “I think that’s disrespectful to the Georgetown students who voted, and not consistent with the mission of GUSA to represent students.”
Samantha Granville (COL ’17), who serves as co-director of outreach for the Khan-Fisk ticket, said their campaign is hopeful for a positive result Sunday.
“I’m still really optimistic about everything. We worked really hard. I’m disappointed we are not going to know tonight, our adrenaline has been going for the past 48 hours for the final push,” Granville said. “I’m still really optimistic that it will turn out in our favor.”
Anirudha Vaddadi (SFS ’16), who serves as a translator for the Hot Chick-Chicken Madness ticket, said on behalf of the Chicken Madness sandwich that the campaign remains optimistic.
“I think it’s a good sign. I think it’s a very close race and the GUSA commissioners will consider candidates very closely. They would not have held off the election result until Sunday if it were an outright victory for [Enushe and Chris],” Vaddadi said. “We have been very patient this election and we want the right leader to be chosen.”

“Putting in the work” means going to the meetings and submitting the right forms. If you did, you would be on the ballot.

I don’t know any of the candidates, but I’ve been reading The Hoya’s coverage of the campaigns. This morning’s story irks me.
The write-in candidates who aren’t chicken sandwiches seem surprised that they are “disadvantaged” by the process. You know what would have eliminated that “disadvantage”? Filing at the appropriate time and attending the required meetings, which would have gotten your name on the ballot. When a ticket decides to join the race the week of the election, it has no one to blame but itself.

SFS 2016 says

Well this election was clearly stolen, as the Election Commission and others met in secret to fix results against the sandwiches

Georgetown University’s first Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey, which closed at midnight on Monday, Feb. 15, saw participation from 51 percent of the entire student body according to recently released figures, meeting the university’s 50 percent participation rate goal.
“I am very encouraged by the strong response from our students to this vital survey. The results and insights from this survey will be valuable in more fully understanding sexual assault on campus, and will help us to shape our programs and policies effectively as we go forward. I’m grateful to all the students and colleagues who have worked hard on this project,” Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson wrote in a statement to The Hoya.
Released to graduate and undergraduate students Jan. 14, the survey was based on a template developed by the Association of American Universities in late 2014. The Sexual Assault Working Group, made up of students and administrators, then specifically tailored the template to fit Georgetown’s unique collegiate climate.
Twenty seven other universities, including Harvard University, Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania have used the survey to measure sexual violence and misconduct on their campuses.
Once the university extended the survey deadline from Feb. 6 to Feb. 15 following initially low yields, participation began rising steadily with 40 percent of the overall student body completing the survey by Feb. 11.
At the survey’s close, 62 percent of all undergraduates and 40 percent of graduate students are reported to have participated. The survey’s average participation rate is 19 percent among participating institutions. Harvard obtained a 53 percent participation rate, Yale had 52 percent, and Brown University had 36 percent.
In an email to the student body Wednesday, University President John J.DeGioia applauded the community in its participation while emphasizing the importance of data in addressing sexual misconduct.
“Your efforts will have a distinct impact on our ability to better address instances of sexual assault and strengthen our culture of care for all members of our community,” DeGioia wrote. “We look forward to sharing the results of the survey with our community in May and to working together on the best ways to use this data to inform our future efforts.”
According to the results released by the university, the most participants came from the School of Nursing and Health Studies, which saw a completion rate of 76 percent, followed by the School of Foreign Service at 69 percent. The two schools with the lowest participation rates included the McDonough School of Business at 41 percent and the School of Continuing Studies at 34 percent.
University Title IX Coordinator Laura Cutway said the data is relevant in establishing future initiatives to address policies aimed at targeting sexual assault.
“I couldn’t have asked for better results,” Cutway wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I am very proud of Georgetown and how we have all come together to encourage one another to take part in this important endeavor. The depth of this feedback will inform our initiatives moving forward and will be felt all over campus.”
Georgetown University Student Association President Joe Luther (COL ’16) also praised the community for its help and contribution to the survey.
“We’re very happy with the turnout from the survey. With such a high participation rate in the future, GUSA and the administration will be able to use the data to craft more effective policies regarding sexual assault,” Luther wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Students across the community praised the survey’s results, calling it a welcome step forward in addressing issues of sexual misconduct on campus.
Brett Voyles (SFS ’19) said she appreciated the survey as a medium and platform for students to voice their personal opinions.
“I think we sometimes feel uncomfortable sometimes asking these questions, so I think it was important that they asked them. I felt like it was a good way for people to voice their opinions on what is actually going on,” Voyles said.
Jason Yoo (MSB ’18),  said he thought that the low turnout from MSB students most likely stems from the timing of spring recruitment season for business internships.
“A lot of juniors and sophomores are more focused on getting internships for the summer,” he said. In response to the significant participation rate among members of the NHS, Alondra Navarro (COL ’19) said NHS students may have a greater interest in student health than students in other schools at Georgetown.
“A lot of the NHS students are in health, their objective is health, and I guess they have more of a passion for that,” Navarro said. “Whereas MSB students are more interested in business and not really interested in that topic or they don’t know much about it.”

In the midst of the spread of the Zika virus, which might cause birth defects, an article published Feb. 1 by Georgetown’s O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law encouraged the World Health Organization to promote birth control and abortion in response to the crisis, sparking a backlash from anti-abortion advocates.
The mosquito-borne disease has been linked to birth defects, namely microcephaly, a condition that causes abnormally small heads and brains in babies with afflicted mothers, throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. The WHO designated the illness, projected to afflict four million people in the Americas this year, as a public health emergency of national concern, a classification reserved for cases requiring immediate international action.
In their article, O’Neill Institute Faculty Director Lawrence Gostin and Georgetown global health law adjunct professor Alexandra Phelan urged WHO Director-General Margaret Chan to incorporate directives aimed at decriminalizing abortion to affected countries. According to their piece, nearly all countries in the Americas suffering from the crisis enforce laws that prevent women from accessing reproductive services.
“To truly respect the dignity and health of women of childbearing age, the WHO Director-General should formally recommend that States Parties ensure access to contraception and safe abortions,” Phelan and Gostin wrote. “A government’s duty to guarantee the health and safety of women and their reproductive freedoms is an ethical and human rights imperative in the ongoing Zika pandemic.”
The WHO’s recommendations, released the same day as the article in an address by Chan, included no such directives and advised governments to counsel pregnant women according to national practices and policies.
Of the 22 countries afflicted by the Zika virus, six, including the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Haiti, ban abortion without exception.
The governments of afflicted countries have issued statements alerting women of the risk of birth defects and advising them to avoid pregnancy for the next two years, a decision Phelan and Gostin denounced.
“Calls by countries that women simply avoid getting pregnant – including those by the governments of Brazil, Honduras, Colombia, and El Salvador – without providing access to reproductive rights services, are not only ineffective and naive but dangerous to both women’s and public health,” Phelan and Gostin wrote.
The professors’ stances have provoked backlash from the pro-life community, which opposes pregnancy termination. Local Catholic churches around the Americas have maintained a strong stance against abortion, although pleas for the church to relax its doctrine escalated in advance of Pope Francis’ six-day trip to Mexico beginning Feb. 12.
When asked whether the Catholic Church should consider contraceptive use in relation to the abortion of fetuses infected with the Zika virus during a press conference on Thursday, the pope suggested that contraceptives could be used to prevent fetal infection, several news sources reported.
“It is to kill someone in order to save another. This is what the Mafia does,” Francis said. “On the other hand, avoiding pregnancy is not an absolute evil.”
Lifenews.com, an independent anti-abortion news outlet, published an editorial by Emily Derois accusing the authors of compromising the university’s Jesuit values.
“Abortion activists have been using the virus to push abortion on the largely Catholic, pro-life countries in South America,” Doris wrote. “Advising women to have an abortion goes directly against the teaching of the Catholic Church, and therefore the very principles that Georgetown was founded upon.”
Phelan and Gostin declined to comment further on the issue.
Michael Khan (COL ’18), president of the secular Georgetown Right to Life, criticized Phelan and Gostin for representing a departure from church doctrine.
“Frankly, I thought it was outrageous. Ending a child’s life is never the solution to a problem, and the fact that Georgetown professors would advocate widespread abortion as a solution to a health epidemic is truly unconscionable,” Khan said.
However, Sophia Kleyman (COL ’16), president of pro-abortion rights student group H*yas for Choice, which is unaffiliated with the university, defended the authors’ position, arguing the virus highlights the abysmal situation of women’s rights and health care around the world.
“It’s completely hypocritical that countries that make abortion completely illegal and birth control functionally inaccessible, are asking women to somehow magically not get pregnant,” Kleyman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Declarations like this are exceptionally insulting and offensive to women, completely ignoring the astronomically high rates of sexual assault.
Khan agreed current dialogue on pregnant women’s options toward microcephaly is inadequate, but he contended this is because abortion is presented as the only alternative.
“The conversation we should be having is that there definitely should be more clinics with child care resources for these women, not only in the United States, but in these affected places in Latin America,” Khan said.
Georgetown University Official Spokesperson Stacy Kerr did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication.
 
 

NHS2019 says 
February 20, 2016 at 8:27 pm
Does the interviewee from HFC really think that there are no ways not to get pregnant other than birth control, abortion, and magic?

The campus-wide referendum on course registration closed this morning with 83 percent of students voting to “keep pre-registration,” 7 percent voting to “switch to live registration” and 9 percent of votes indicating “no preference.”
Thirty-three percent of students participated in the referendum, which was attached to the election ballot for the Georgetown University Student Association executive office.
GUSA senators approved the resolution to hold the referendum Jan. 24 after a December announcement by former Registrar John Q. Pierce (CAS ’72) at a town hall that the university was considering upgrading its registration software, a process that requires the university to decide between software that offers live registration or a more expensive option that will keep pre-registration.
Chair of GUSA Senate Outreach Committee Richie Mullaney (COL ’18), who led student outreach for the referendum, said the goal of the referendum was for GUSA to be able to better represent its student constituency.
“We provided objective information to the student body so that they could decide what they wanted. One of the biggest criticisms of GUSA is that we advocate for issues without knowing what students want, so we had this referendum to understand how students felt,” Mullaney said. “Now with the overwhelming mandate for pre-registration, I expect GUSA to have a full-fledged campaign to keep pre-registration.”
The Intellectual Life Committee of the GUSA senate is now expected to further advocate updating to Banner 9, the new pre-registration software option.
According to GUSA Senator for Alumni Square & Nevils Roopa Mulpuri (SFS ’18), who co-sponsored the referendum resolution, the change in registrar may complicate GUSA’s advocacy efforts.
“At this point, we’re just hoping to start the dialogue with the interim registrar, sit down, talk to him about the results and let him know that this is where student opinion is now,” Mulpuri said. “We’re hoping to continue that conversation over the summer with the replacement for the registrar which they said should be named by July.”
GUSA Senator for the Village A District Samantha Granville (COL ’17), who supported live registration, said there is still a chance the university could opt to adopt live registration, though it is unlikely.
“I think they’re definitely going to consider [live registration] just because it was the senate that first put it up for a vote, more in the interests of what students want,” Granville said. “Eighty-three percent definitely says something, but then again they are considering [live registration] for a reason, but as I said before, it was a huge, huge majority of people who want to keep it.”
This year’s referendum participation, estimated at around 2,500 votes, fell lower than the 2,996 votes reached in the last referendum in 2013 over the potential expansion of a satellite campus.
According to GUSA Election Commissioner Grady Willard (SFS ’18), this could be due to the lack of interest in the single-ticket executive race as well as the issue itself.
“I think it’s obvious that the GUSA election is dominated not by the referendum, but by the candidates, and this race only had one candidate, so that influenced the fact that turnout was a whole lot lower,” Willard said. “I wasn’t here, but I’m sure a lot of people did not like the idea of having a satellite campus somewhere in Virginia … more than the idea of live registration.”
 

Jiang Zemin says 
February 19, 2016 at 11:29 am
The satellite campus referendum was much much different, because it coincided with GUSA Senate elections which generated very little interest. This referendum was an afterthought; One Georgetown, One Campus was the whole enchilada.

In honor of Black History Month, civil rights authors Andrew Aydin (GRD ’12) and Edward Peeples explored their published works and articulated personal stories of activism within the civil rights movement in a discussion hosted by Georgetown University’s graduate liberal studies department, titled “Civil Rights in Black and White: Two Stories of the 1960s Struggle” in the Leavey Conference Center on Feb. 10.
Aydin co-authored the graphic novel series “March,” a story detailing the involvement of civil rights activist John Lewis (D-Ga.) in the civil rights movement, with Lewis. Peeples wrote “Scalawag: A White Southerner’s Journey through Segregation to Human Rights Activism,” chronicling his life and activism against institutional racism.
The event was part of a larger ensemble of forums, celebrations and discussions on the nature of Black History Month and the individuals who have contributed to racial equality and combatted racial injustices.
After a reception and book signing, John Dolan and Ann Ritter, associate deans of the graduate liberal studies program, introduced the evening’s panelists. Ritter spoke briefly of Georgetown’s role in the larger history of civil rights while also noting the university’s recent developments to address its history with slavery.
Ritter acknowledged the work of Georgetown’s Working Group on Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation, including its involvement in changing the names of two buildings to Freedom and Remembrance Halls, previously known as Mulledy and McSherry Halls, respectively.
“Their work enlightens us on the reality of slavery right here on campus in the 1800s to the present time as the university creates more concrete and interesting ways to fulfill the Jesuit mission, a service of faith in which the promotion of justice is an absolute requirement,” Ritter said.
Aydin began by speaking on his research and relationship with the civil rights movement. Through the success of “March,” Aydin believes graphic novels will drastically improve and enhance childhood knowledge of the civil rights movement in the United States.
He added that popular visual communication tools such as memes should not be barred from use in education. Aydin argued that the teaching of major historical events and stories, especially Lewis’ story, should be told through mediums young readers can engage with more easily than a typical novel or textbook. Aydin mentioned the “nine-word problem,” in which the average American graduates from high school knowing only nine words about the civil rights movement.
“John Lewis believes, just as Dr. [Martin Luther King Jr.] did, that you have to use creative solutions to solve difficult problems, and so now we’ve got this book in circulation around this country and we are solving this nine-word problem,” Aydin said.
Following Aydin’s remarks, Peeples took the podium to discuss his book and activist history after an introduction from his publicist, James Hirshman.
Peeples explained how, during his involvement in civil rights, individuals would refer to him as a “scalawag,” a derogatory term for a Southerner who sympathized with the cause of the civil rights movement.
Peeples read a few selections from his book and spoke of his efforts as a young man to advance the cause of the civil rights movement, both through his involvement in academia and in researching institutional slavery in Virginia.
In one reading, he described seeing a black bus driver with Gallaudet University be denied service at a cafeteria after driving the collegiate team to play a basketball game against Virginia Commonwealth University. Peeples not only brought the man food from the cafeteria, but ensured he received the same number of choices that the white clientele were receiving that day.
Peeples said it was difficult trying to remove himself from the racist ideology prevalent throughout his upbringing.
“I had spent the last year and a half trying to wrench myself intellectually from the clutches of a racist upbringing, and watching him being debased like that brought home how profoundly evil white supremacy was and that I must do something to protest,” Peeples said.
Following Peeple’s concluding remarks, audience members praised the discussion and expressed appreciation for the panelists’ openness on their involvement with the Civil Rights Movement.
Phyllis Gilchrist (GRD ’16), who attended the event, commended the panelists and pointed out similarities between their experiences and the ongoing activism in current events.
“In order to understand what’s going on in our present society in regard to social issues, we have to understand in context how we got to this place, and that’s by always going back to our history,” Gilchrist said

The District of Columbia Universal Paid Leave Act, which would give people working in D.C. paid leave to care for a baby or ill relative, received the endorsement of D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) on Feb. 11, a major step forward for the bill.
The bill was spearheaded by Council members David Grosso (I-At Large) and Elissa Silverman (I-At Large), and if implemented, would allow workers in the District paid time off to care for a newborn, ailing relative or themselves if they were to fall ill.
Despite the newfound support, Mayor Muriel Bowser has expressed opposition to the bill because of its cost to taxpayers and the lack of decision-making input given to the mayor’s office by the D.C. Council.
Mendelson issued a new draft of the legislation at a council hearing Feb. 11, which reworked the bill to make it more economically viable and more attractive to taxpayers.
His changes include reducing the amount of paid leave from 16 weeks to 12 weeks, decreasing the percentage that high-income earners are eligible to receive and restricting the leave of those with chronic and mental illnesses. Additionally, Mendelson’s draft requires employees to prove a legal relationship with the person for whom they are caring.
If enacted, the act would make D.C. a more generous place in the United States for workers to take time off, even with Mendelson’s cuts. According to The Washington Post, Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have both signaled support for the bill.
Grosso said the bill plays a pivotal role in demonstrating the District’s regard for its workers.
“This is something I think is very important and necessary for our city. In fact, in the long run I think it’s important for our entire country,” Grosso said. “This is the next step for creating a country and a city that respects families for real.”
In addition to Bowser’s objections to the bill, other critics fear a negative impact on businesses. According to the proposal, District employers and residents would be required to pay 1 percent of payroll or income in taxes for the program. As an insurance-based model, the tax revenues would be put into a fund, into which employees could tap when in need.
In a testimony addressing the act at the council hearing, D.C. Chamber of Commerce Interim President and CEO Margaret Singleton expressed appreciation for the amendments made to the legislation but also raised new concerns.
“We note that it still creates a new paid time off entitlement program administered by the government; it still makes the District of Columbia less competitive and attractive for businesses; it still supports itself by enforcing a maximum 1-percent tax on D.C. businesses; and it does not credit the businesses who already offer paid leave and benefit programs equal to or greater than what the program mandates,” Singleton said. “These concerns, the bill’s costs, and its negative impact on the business community have yet to be fully addressed.”
Singleton also expressed concern for D.C. businesses and employers, who would be required to pay the 1 percent tax.
“The D.C. Chamber of Commerce and its members want to ensure that their employees are able to take care of themselves and their families,” Singleton said. “We consider our employees our most valuable assets and resources.”
However, D.C. Paid Family Leave campaign manager Joanna Blotner maintained that businesses would benefit from the legislation, citing increased incentives for workers to seek employment in the District because of the generous leave.
“I think we’ve heard from the small businesses who are supporting our campaign that it really has the opposite impact to what the chamber claims,” Blotner said.
“With D.C. being on the front lines of providing really strong paid family medical programs, we’re creating an economy where D.C. jobs now provide the best benefits in the country. That increases the talent pool, the competitiveness and the market for these businesses. When we’re talking about recruitment and retention, this gives our D.C. economy a huge leg up.”
Mendelson similarly expressed hope that the act will attract new workers to the District in a press release published Feb. 11.
“I think the preferred perspective on the legislation is that we should be looking at what we can do that is business-friendly for the District and maximizes benefit for workers,” Mendelson said. “We have the opportunity, through this legislation, that if we strike the right balance, it will make the city more attractive to employers because it will be more attractive to employees through the benefit package that this bill would provide.”
However, Blotner also criticized various aspects of Mendelson’s cuts, including the strict definitions of a legal relationship with family members receiving care from employees.
“On the family definition side, the bill currently says that a family member is defined by legal custody, domestic partnership or marriage or a foster child. While that is all well and good for people that fall into those boundaries, it still excludes a lot of people,” Blotner said. “Siblings, grandparents and adult children are left out.”
According to current D.C. job-protection laws, employers cannot replace an employee on leave for at least 16 weeks after the worker begins his time off, a policy upon which Grosso builds in his proposal.
“This is just creating a mechanism so that when workers are out for that time, which they already have a right to be out for, they don’t go bankrupt,” Grosso said.
In its current state, the bill would cover the entirety of the private sector workforce.
The pay replacement would be 90 percent for those making up to double minimum wage and would scale down for those making above that point. This mechanism ensures that the people who are most in need of financial resources have their highest pay replaced.
Blotner emphasized the importance of the act in providing security to families going through difficult times.
“The situation that we’re facing in the District is one where people are making these terrible choices between caring for themselves and their loved ones, or earning the money they need for providing for themselves, and we have an opportunity and a solution, a policy that can fix that,” Blotner said.
“The paid family leave policy is about creating a system that really allows people to take the time that they need to care for their families and care for themselves without risking the financial security that they need to be members of society and of the workforce.”
Despite the opposition, Grosso expressed continued confidence that the bill will pass, as it will benefit both employers and employees in the District.
“I think the business community is going to have to make an adjustment, but the fact is that this won’t be an enormous cost to them and they’ll get enormous benefit from it,” Grosso said. “Employees will be able to be paid to take time off and take care of the situations that they find themselves in, whether it’s a new baby or caring for their elderly parent, and that I think is a greater benefit than the loss that they’ll face having to pay into this fund.”

Nationally acclaimed comedians Nick Kroll (COL ’01) and John Mulaney (COL ’04) spoke in Gaston Hall on Tuesday morning about their experiences as part of Georgetown’s comedy scene, their advice for aspiring comedians and their most memorable stories about vomiting at Georgetown.
“I was leaving [Lauinger] and I was on my way to ‘Euro Civ’, and I threw up in those hedges right near the stairs. I didn’t just email my professor and say ‘I’m feeling sick, I can’t make it to class.’ I emailed her and said, ‘You will never believe what happened,’” Mulaney said, noting that he had the flu at the time.
Kroll’s most noteworthy vomit-related story took place during his freshman year, the morning after he had fallen down the stairs in New South and hit his head.
“I wake up the next morning with a huge bruise on the back of my head and I can’t stand up and then my friend comes in and she’s like, ‘We have a Spanish test.’ And I’m like, ‘I can’t go.’ And then my mom calls and is like, ‘We’re here!’” Kroll recalled.
Kroll said that his friend took him to the Leavey Center to get juice when he began to feel sick.
“I run to look for the bathroom, and I run to the bathroom and puke all over the door to the women’s bathroom,” Kroll said.
Georgetown University Student Association President Joe Luther (COL ’16) and Vice President Connor Rohan (COL ’16), who are both members of the Georgetown Improv Association, introduced Mulaney and Kroll at the start of the event, which was sponsored by the Lecture Fund and moderated by associate board member Olivia Hinerfeld (SFS ’17).
“Over the past decade, Nick Kroll and John Mulaney have boarded a rocket ship to stardom. They are now two of the most recognizable names in comedy. They have truly set the world on fire,” Rohan said. “But not in the way that the Jesuits had hoped.”
Gaston Hall’s main seating area was nearly full with students, with no one sitting in the balcony. Kroll and Mulaney gestured to the empty balcony as they stepped on stage.
Kroll and Mulaney came to Gaston Hall while they were in D.C. to perform their two-man show “Oh, Hello,” which ran in Warner Theater on Sunday, Monday and Wednesday.Kroll and Mulaney play quirky old New Yorkers named Gil Faizon and George St. Geegland who, among other things, are known for pranking people by giving them sandwiches with “too much tuna.”
Kroll and Mulaney performed the off-Broadway show in New York City in December and have since been touring the country.
The pair said that they have been working on the characters for a decade and were initially met with rejection.
“We were doing those guys 10 years ago and we were trying desperately to get into the Aspen Comedy Festival and they wouldn’t accept the show. They thought it was too old,” Kroll said. “It was pretty decimating to not get in. … But the other side of it was that we believed that this was funny and we needed to keep doing it.”
Kroll, the star of “The League” and “Kroll Show,” and Mulaney, a former “Saturday Night Live” writer known for his standup and his short-lived eponymous sitcom “Mulaney,” met while at Georgetown in 2001. Kroll, who was a senior at the time, said that he was immediately impressed by Mulaney’s audition for the Georgetown Improv Association.
“John was fantastic. As usual, good first impression and downhill after that,” Kroll quipped. “We cast him in the group and within a few weeks I was like, ‘This is the funniest person I’ve ever met.’”
“And I thought Nick was nice,” Mulaney added.
Mulaney said that it wasn’t until he saw the success of fellow alumni Kroll and comedian Mike Birbiglia (COL ’00), known for his standup and for his film “Sleepwalk with Me,” that he realized that a career in comedy was viable.
“Watching Nick and Birbiglia do comedy and get some sort of wage for it, I was like, ‘Oh, that’s a real thing that can happen,’” Mulaney said.
Kroll encouraged students to not be scared off by the pre-professional tone set at Georgetown and to consider all their options.
“The time after college is a time to take some risks and do whatever it is that’s in your heart. The main philosophy that I took upon graduating was that I was more scared of regret than rejection,” Kroll said. “That was a huge thing for me. Like, whether I make it in comedy or not, I feel like I tried to do it. I didn’t want to look back and feel like I didn’t try.”
Kroll told aspiring comedians that they should fully commit to comedy if they hope to be successful.
“If you have a backup plan, instead of comedy … go do it. If you can’t commit entirely to the thing you want to do, then you’re not going to follow through,” Kroll said.
Much of what Kroll and Mulaney said during the event was met with laughter and applause. Some attendees said that they enjoyed both the comedic aspect of the discussion and the advice that Kroll and Mulaney offered.
Robert Kem (COL ’18) praised Mulaney and Kroll, noting their fondness for one another and their advice to individuals who aspire for careers in comedy.
“They were exciting speakers and I definitely appreciated their dedication to one another and their emphasis on perseverance when it comes to breaking into comedy,” Kem said.

Georgetown University Police Department Chief Jay Gruber highlighted GUPD’s new Sexual Assault Response Team and addressed student concerns in light of the D.C. Policing Bill at a roundtable discussion in the Leavey Program Room on Feb. 10.
The proposed bill will increase GUPD jurisdiction and allow officers to handle student conduct situations off campus. As of press time, there is no scheduled date for the bill’s vote.
Gruber began the discussion by highlighting new safety initiatives GUPD has implemented, including the installation of card readers in residence halls and overall increased security.
GUPD continues to facilitate new “Run. Hide. Fight.” trainings for students, faculty and campus groups. These trainings outline how to deal with active shooter situations on campus. GUPD is also offering self-defense classes for both men and women.
“We put a lot of programs in place recently that I think sort of enhance the safety and security on campus,” Gruber said.
Gruber continued the discussion on GUPD initiatives by highlighting efforts addressing sexual misconduct. Gruber noted the assembly of the new Sexual Assault Response Team, and explained how the care needed to address cases involving survivors of sexual assault needed a specially trained team.
“If we screw this up, if we treat them badly, if we don’t provide them with the resources that they need, we have failed them,” Gruber said. “Getting the [SART] together was extremely important to me, and I am really happy we have that resource for survivors.”
A trained SART officer is available to the community 24 hours a day at GUPD, and Gruber encouraged survivors of sexual assault to take advantage of these specifically trained officers if they want to contact the police about their situation.
The roundtable soon turned to focus on the new bill proposed by the D.C. City Council, known as the D.C. Policing Bill. Many students at the roundtable expressed their concerns about the bill, which would increase jurisdiction for GUPD and give officers the freedom to handle student conduct issues off campus. Gruber, in an attempt to assuage fears and concerns, discussed the bill and dispelled myths surrounding it.
“It provides absolutely zero criminal jurisdiction. We can’t enforce laws off campus, we can’t enforce traffic law, criminal law, we can’t write criminal citations, any of that,” Gruber said. “What it provides for us is the ability for us to go offcampus for some sort of student conduct violation.”
If the bill is passed in its current state, GUPD would have to submit a safety plan to the Metropolitan Police Department for approval. Gruber believed such a relationship with MPD would provide oversight for GUPD’s increased jurisdiction as well as its actions in off-campus situations.
“The safety plan would be confirmed by MPD,” Gruber said. “So there are some checks and balances.”
Gruber also emphasized how he hoped there would be a collaborative approach taken to creating the safety plan, which would include input from students, faculty, administrators and all members of the Georgetown community.
Gruber also said he does not intend to use the bill to simply crack down on the social lives of students living off campus.
“I never want to see a lot of my police officers off-campus,” he said.
Following Gruber’s remarks on the bill, many students remain concerned with the bill’s potential effects on off-campus student living.
Off-campus Senator of the Georgetown University Student Association Senate and Intellectual Life Chair Eric Henshall (COL ’16) said he was concerned about the new pressures on students the bill would create.
“I think the big issue is that even if GUPD doesn’t want to use a lot of the expanded jurisdiction they have, I’m more concerned about pressure from the neighbors, pressure that may be coming from Chief Gruber’s superiors or future Chiefs of Police who would be looking to crack down on student life,” Henshall said.
Speaker of the GUSA senate and 2016 GUSA presidential candidate Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) noted there are strong elements of the bill, but GUSA and student government bodies at other D.C. universities, such as American University and The George Washington University, would like to see amendments and further revision to the authority of campus officers.
“The bill does have some great elements to it,” Khan said. “The main concern of course is administrative authority on off-campus matters.”
Director of the Student Advocacy Office Ryan Shymansky (COL ’16) also supports some of the provisions of the bill, but said the increased jurisdiction of GUPD could affect students in the long-term future.
“There are parts of this that make a lot of sense, increased training for special police officers, allowing special police officers to assist Metro in certain situations, but just extending jurisdiction is wrong,” Shymansky said.
Shymansky emphasized working in collaboration with Gruber and GUPD can create safer living environments for students in the short and long term.
“I think that working with Chief Gruber on this is something we can look to after the bill is passed,” Shymansky said. “On the immediate term, the focus needs to be on changing it so that it protects students and neighbors.”
Both Henshall and Khan noted Gruber’s willingness to engage with students on this issue. Henshall spoke highly of the SSAB as a reliable venue to voice student concerns to GUPD.
“It would be nice to see more departments in the university adopting that model,” Henshall said.
Toward the end of the roundtable, Gruber noted how GUPD does not exist to get students in trouble, but it is there to keep all students safe.
“The bottom line is, I’m here for the students. I’m not here for the police department to run an interdisciplinary program, I’m here to keep the students safe,” Gruber said.

Georgetown students hailing from states around the country registered to vote by way of absentee ballots in anticipation of upcoming presidential primaries at a voter registration drive called GU Votes: Absentee Voter Registration Party in Sellinger Lounge on Wednesday.
Hosted by GU Votes, a subcommittee of Georgetown University Politics, along with the College Democrats and College Republicans, the event aimed to register Georgetown students to vote before the fast-approaching deadlines, especially those from states that will be participating in the upcoming Super Tuesday primaries.
The event lasted two hours and in that time, over 30 students from more than seven different states including Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Texas and Virginia, each with their own distinct voter registration process, registered to vote.
GU Politics Director of Programming Sophie Goldmacher said the event was initiated by the institute’s desire to encourage more students to vote despite a complicated registration process.
“As a hub of political activity and engagement on campus, GU Politics felt like it was our responsibility to help Hoyas navigate the sometimes confusing world of registering to vote and absentee balloting,” Goldmacher said. “The best part is, GU Votes is totally driven and managed by Georgetown students – Hoyas helping Hoyas have a voice in the political process.”
TurboVote, a nonprofit voter registration organization used at college campuses across the country that recently forged a relationship with Georgetown, provided technological support for the event. The nonprofit aids students in navigating their states’ voting process by helping them register, obtain absentee ballots and vote by mail.
Zach Esber (COL ’19) emphasized the impact TurboVote had on streamlining registration.
“It really expedited the process. Our system of registering to vote in general is pretty convoluted so I was surprised with how simple it was to use TurboVote,” Esber said. “Anything that makes voting easier, especially on a college campus, is worthwhile.”
For GU Votes, getting students to register themselves and vote is of paramount importance. The program takes aim at political apathy on campus by encouraging students to take time in their busy schedules to register.
Goldmacher highlighted the power of voting, especially for students, as a means of ensuring representation.
“Voting is one of our most fundamental rights as Americans, and we encourage students to vote no matter their political party,” Goldmacher said.
GU Politics Student Advisory Board member Madwa-Nika Cadet (MPP ’17), who volunteered at the event, said registering is a necessary step to take in enacting change.
“Being registered is the first step towards exercising your right as a citizen to express yourself. I think young people don’t want to vote, they say that the system is broken and they don’t want to participate,” Cadet said. “If that’s true, that the system is already broken, voting can help make it better.”
GU Votes member Gabriela Barrera (SFS ’19), who helped register other students, acknowledged the difficulty of absentee voting, but encouraged all students to take the time to register.
“Voting is an extremely important process, but I can testify to the fact that when you have to worry about extracurriculars and academics it’s really easy to forget to register absentee and get your ballot in,” Barrera said. “Our project is to make sure that with all the hustle and bustle of college life, students are still able to vote.”
Luc Woodard (MSB ’18), who registered to vote by absentee ballot during the event, agreed that voting provides him, and other students, the best option to participate in the political process.
“I think any time that you push to get younger people to vote it’s good. Historically young people have been one of the least represented groups,” Woodard said. “I decided to register to vote today because I feel that right now I’m really disappointed in the current political state of the U.S. and if I didn’t register and didn’t make my voice heard then I wouldn’t have the right to be disappointed in the results of the election.”
Barrera said that in light of the currently tumultuous presidential elections, the success of the event, as well as the creation of GU Votes itself, can be attributed to the collective value of voter registration.
“Spring break is coming up in a few weeks, go back home and register to vote,” Barrera said. “Do whatever you can to make sure that your voice as a college student, your voice as a millennial, is heard.”

The Northeast Triangle Residence Hall is expected to be completed on schedule this summer and will house sophomores beginning in the fall.
Students will be able to preview the building beginning Feb. 26 in Sellinger Lounge, where they will also be able to vote on the furniture for the building’s common areas. The building had a construction cost of $36.5 million and an overall project cost of $46 million.
Located between the Henle Village apartments and the Reiss Science Building, the eight-story, 81,220-square-foot residence hall will house 225 beds in semi-suite arrangements capable of holding two, four or six students in double bedrooms with shared bathrooms. Each floor includes a kitchen, lounge and study room. Public amenities on the first floor will also include a multi-purpose space, a study space, a demonstration kitchen and an outdoor space with seating and a grilling area.
According to Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey, planning for the building began in fall 2012 as part of the 2010 Campus Plan’s requirement that 450 beds be moved on campus by 2017. Construction officially began in the spring of 2014.
“The technical piece of it was the new campus plan,” Morey said. “The bigger and broader picture as part of our master planning efforts is that we wanted to develop a living and learning campus.”
Morey noted that the goal to find more on-campus living arrangements for students spurred the university to make the north side of campus more populated.
“We heard complaints from students who live in Darnall and Henle that they felt isolated,” Morey said. “The Northeast Triangle was an opportunity to better utilize some open space that did not have the highest and best land use.”
Morey said that receiving authorization from the Old Georgetown Board, a regulatory body that approves architecture, construction and renovations in the Georgetown district, was the most challenging part of the process. Composed of three architects, the board is run by the Commission of Fine Arts, a federal entity.
Tasked with preserving the historic nature of Georgetown neighborhoods, the Old Georgetown Board had reservations about the early designs of the Northeast Triangle, criticizing them for not fitting in with the surrounding aesthetic of university buildings.
“We originally tried to get more of a modern style of building with a transition from the historic to the more modern,” Morey said. “We went through several iterations of that process. We changed the design pretty significantly to what you see now.”
When the plan for the building was first put into motion, the university formed a design committee of administrators and students to give feedback on the early designs. Georgetown University Student Association Secretary for Residential Living Connor Maytnier (COL ‘17) served on this committee his freshman year, weighed in on the early designs put forth by the design architecture firm, Sasaki Associates.
“Sasaki had shown a couple different options, and the exterior of the building went through some changes with the towers, brick versus stone, et cetera,” Maytnier said. “It went through a couple iterations. We were just giving some general feedback in terms of what students like when we think about the exterior of buildings.”
The glass exterior of the first floor will be open to the campus community, and a glass tower on the north side of the building will contain glass-floor lounges on each story. The rest of the building will be stone and brick to create private spaces for bedrooms.
“What this building tries to do is pull all of that materiality together and make a transition from the historic stone of the Healy quad to the more modern brick and glass of [Rafik B. Hariri Building] and Regents [Hall],” Morey said.
Assistant Vice President of Design and Construction Gina Bleck, who has overseen the project from the beginning, emphasized how the building’s materials strive to combine the university’s future with its historic past.
“Materiality was about bridging between the historic campus and more modern elements,” Bleck said. “That’s how we got to something that is very modern but respects the historic properties of White Gravenor. We tried to get a stone that would be compatible and articulate it in a way that was modern but reminiscent of the historic.”
Bleck said the building will include a wide, grand staircase and a new ramp for students with physical disabilities, replacing a previous ramp that did not meet the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
The newly opened space between the Northeast Triangle and Red Square will also include cafe tables and chairs. The currently closed Leavey Center Bridge will also be reopened, giving students a direct route from the Northeast Triangle plaza to the Leavey Center.
“Architecturally and from a planning perspective, the experience of the space between Reiss and Northeast Triangle enhances the campus experience,tiBleck said. aid. lly and from a planning perspective, the experience of the spa I am very confident that the space will be lovely and well used by students.”
Senior Architect in the Office of Design and Construction Amy Sanderson encouraged rising sophomores to attend the preview Feb. 26.
“It’s great,” Sanderson said. “It gives you a great idea of what the building will be like, what the rooms will look like, and whether or not you will be interested in living there. It’s really beneficial for students.”
The new dorm will house the French Floor and the Global Living Community as well as a chaplain-in-residence and a faculty-in-residence, Assistant Dean for Residential Living Stephanie Lynch confirmed in an email to The Hoya.
GUSA Secretary of Campus Planning Ari Goldstein (COL ’18) said that although the dorm would be a nice residence hall, he is uneasy about the mandatory three-year housing requirement now placed on upperclassmen.
Where I have pause is the fact that the Northeast Triangle I don’t think is an inherently necessary positive addition to student life on campus,” Goldstein said. “It’s a building that we built practically because of the neighbors. It was never a necessary expenditure of money and space on campus, but, given the restrictions imposed by the last campus plan, Residential Living is doing their best to put together a good residence hall.”
Morey expressed enthusiasm for the project’s completion.
“When it’s done we’re going to have improved accessibility on campus, we’re going to have strengthened a walkway and fortified it, and we’re going to have more community on the north side,” Morey said.

The National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities recently awarded Michael Plankey, associate professor of medicine and an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Georgetown University Medical Center, with a $2.1 million dollar grant over five years to study healthy aging among HIV-positive gay and bisexual males.
Professor and Director of Behavioral and Community Health Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health Ron Stall will work with Plankey to conduct the longitudinal study, which involves 1,600 participants. Participants in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study are gay or bisexual men aged 40 or older gay, with and without HIV. MACS, which started in 1983, has so far studied 7,000 gay men nationwide.
The research will require participants to return every six months for the next three years to undergo physical examinations, give blood specimens and answer demographic, medical and behavioral questionnaires.
Plankey and Stall developed the idea in 2013 in response to a lack of studies that investigated strengths and countermeasures that can be taken to help HIV sufferers, as most studies conducted examined their health risks only.
Stall emphasized the impact this largely negative outlook has on those afflicted with HIV in preventing the discovery of helpful measures.
“One of the big themes in the study that we are looking at is that the overarching trope for describing gay men in general, but for sure older gay men, … ‘We don’t have enough knowledge, we have too much sex, we use too many drugs, we engage in too many bad behaviors’ and that all of these things need to be fixed,” Stall said.
According to Stall, the study is particularly timely, as currently more than half of all people living with HIV are older than age 50. Stall said that this demographic group has been allowed to live with their disease and age because of great medical advancements, but research into ways to help this aging population suffering from multiple afflictions remains deficient.
Stall noted that although many have thrived despite being HIV-positive, there are new challenges presented by aging that add to the difficulties of living with the virus.
“You’ve got a whole cohort of people who are older, gay men who have lived with the effects of homophobia their entire lives, some of whom are also HIV-positive and fighting from the effects of a serious disease who are also fighting with the many health problems that are concomitant of aging itself and the social aspects of aging,” Stall said.
Stall said this group of participants is ideal for the study seeing as they represent both the HIV-positive and negative populations and are all facing the challenges of aging.
“We do not know how to take care of all of these multiple health and social issues with a new cohort of HIV-positive people who are now entering old age,” Stall said. “And so this cohort is perfectly set up to help us answer those questions.”
Plankey said the project will allow for the identification of resiliencies, which are healthy living conditions that can improve medical care for both infected and uninfected gay and bisexual men.
“A good part of this grant is to identify what those resiliencies are,” Plankey said. “This particular grant is to discover the full compass of resiliencies that keep men from risky behaviors and poor health outcomes.”
Stall emphasized the study’s aim in gaining insight into these resiliencies to truly help those who are struggling.
“Many of these guys are balancing and dealing with the challenges of aging, homophobia, HIV and they are doing spectacularly well and so maybe if we focused on what are the strengths of this population and what are the resiliencies,” Stall said. “Then we would also be able to export these resiliencies to other men who aren’t doing as well and raise the levels of health in the whole population. So that’s the hope and the excitement of this study.”
Stall expressed excitement to be able to partake in one of the principal studies on this age group.
“There haven’t been very many studies on aging among gay people, and this will for sure be one of the largest and one of the first and so it’s a remarkable opportunity to be part of this,” Stall said.
Program Director of the National HIV/AIDS Initiative at Georgetown’s O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law Jeffrey S. Crowley said the study truly hits at the heart of the problem and comes at the right time to provide the necessary support for the population participating in the study.
“If we are to realize our goal and the vision for the country’s National HIV/AIDS Strategy in which all people living with HIV are well supported in systems of care that enable them to lead long and healthy lives, then we must glean lessons from the men of the MACS cohort that have been heroes of the HIV response for more than 30 years,” Crowley wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This study is being led by visionary leaders in the field and as we increasingly acknowledge the need to promote resiliency within the LGBT community as a primary strategy for reducing the impact of HIV on gay and bisexual men, it cannot come at a more opportune time.”

The Georgetown University Law Center announced the establishment of the Williams Research Professorships on Feb. 3, made possible by a donation from Agnes N. Williams (LAW ’54), the first woman to graduate from Georgetown Law.
The six professorships were created to support recently tenured members of GULC. In order to be eligible for a professorship, Georgetown Law faculty must have had tenure for no more than ten years prior to their appointment. The recipients are selected by GULC Executive Vice President and GULC Dean William M. Treanor based on scholarly work done in and out of Georgetown, as well as the recommendations of a three-person committee.
The committee is comprised of the Associate Dean for Research Josh Teitelbaum and the two most recently installed professorship holders. Faculty members who are appointed to a professorship serve three-year terms and receive a research fund of $10,000 a year. Each year, two more professors are elected. Starting in 2018, there will be six professorship recipients each year.
The Law Center recognized professors Kristin Henning and John Mikhail as the inaugural Williams research professors.
Treanor highlighted the unique nature of the new professorships, which attempt to demonstrate appreciation of newer faculty members.
“The idea for the Williams professorships is different,” Treanor said. “Our focus is on giving a professorship to our newer stars that will both recognize the contribution they’ve made to the Law Center and will help them with their research.”
Treanor emphasized the longevity of the program and its importance in contributing to the Law Center.
“It’s an endowed professorship, so it will be a permanent part of the Law Center landscape,” Treanor said.
Henning serves as director of the Mid-Atlantic Juvenile Defender Center and president of the board of directors for the Center for Children’s Law and Policy. She specializes in juvenile justice reform, particularly focusing on the ways implicit racial bias may undermine the advocacy of defense attorneys. Henning also recently developed a 42-lesson curriculum in partnership with the National Juvenile Defender Center to train juvenile defenders.
Henning connected the marginalization of minority children to the excess of inequality in the legal system.
“Children of color who perceive that they are being mistreated by the police are going to have less respect for the police and for the law,” Henning said. “If you want people to be compliant with social norms and with the laws of society, you have to treat them with respect and with dignity.”
Henning emphasized her desire to bridge her research and the application of that research through the opportunities provided by the Williams Professorship.
“It’s not research for the sake of research,” Henning said. “It’s research for application, for improving the lives of children.”
Mikhail, whose areas of expertise span from moral psychology to constitutional law, has had research published in various journals. His book “Elements of Moral Cognition: Rawls’ Linguistic Analogy and the Cognitive Science of Moral and Legal Judgment,” argues that there are parallels between the theory of moral cognition and the theory of universal grammar.
Mikhail also recently published an article on the Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution.
“The core issue is whether the Constitution vests implied powers in the government of the United States that are not necessarily expressly enumerated in the text,” Mikhail said.
Mikhail expressed interest in organizing one or more conferences at Georgetown and inviting colleagues from around the country to speak to the community about both moral psychology and constitutional history through the opportunities provided by the Williams professorship.
“It’s a great honor to be recognized with this professorship,” Mikhail said. “I am very grateful to Dean Treanor, to the committee that selected me and to Agnes Williams and the Williams family for their generosity.”

In a conclusion of Washington, D.C.’s Education Week, the District announced a scholarship partnership that will provide valedictorians and salutatorians from public and public charter schools full scholarships to the University of the District of Columbia. The announcement also included a plan to create more space for current charter schools, which would otherwise be relocated.
Mayor Muriel Bowser, Deputy Mayor for Education Jennifer Niles and University of the District of Columbia President Ronald Mason, Jr. jointly initiated the scholarships, called the District of Columbia University Partnership, which will allow students to receive four full years of schooling free of tuition.
Bowser stressed the initiative’s importance in creating a robust middle class through this partnership with D.C.’s only public university at a press conference Feb. 5.
“We are cementing a pathway to the middle class for our students with this innovative program at the University of the District of Columbia,” Bowser said. “I am proud to continue to work with UDC as we make critical investments in District youth.”
D.C. Public Schools Press Secretary Michelle Lerner declined to comment on the initiative.
Bowser and Niles also introduced a plan to solicit two excess DCPS school buildings, which aims to create more long-term space for public charter schools. The plan will allow charter schools to make needed capital improvements and provide sustained programming to students and families.
The new solicitation will also allow charter schools to sign multiyear leases for the buildings where Keene Elementary School in Ward 5 and P.R. Harris in Ward 8 are currently located.
D.C. Public Charter School Board Executive Director Scott Pearson stressed that the initiative will allow the community to experience educational continuity in a press release published Feb. 5.
“Today, through Mayor Bowser’s leadership, three public charter schools will be able to stay in the buildings in which they’re currently located,” Pearson said. “This is good for our students, parents and community because our schools can focus on teaching instead of looking for new space.”
 
Pearson also expressed the board’s support for the new solicitation of the two charter schools, citing it as essential for the community’s health as whole at the Feb. 5 press conference.
“Letting public charter schools occupy unused buildings is a good thing,” Pearson said. “It removes a neighborhood blight, it saves the city maintenance money and generates lease revenue for the city. Most importantly, it will ensure more families have access to choose the school that is the right fit for their child.”
Ale Parra (SFS ’19), a tutor and coordinator for the D.C. Schools Project, a program that provides English tutoring services to the District’s low-income or immigrant communities, emphasized that the new scholarship program could motivate students to aim higher.
“A lot of them are in the immigrant communities and they’re struggling to learn English and be on the same level as everyone else, just because of the language barrier,” Parra said. “A lot of the time something like being valedictorian can be a little ways off, like in their younger years, but I feel that since we’re starting to work with them now, they learn about the scholarship later on in high school. I think it could work as an incentive for them to work harder and it would open doors for them.”

Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center researchers and the Innovation Center for Biomedical Informatics published a study Feb. 3 indicating a relationship between the Ly6 family of genes, which allow cancers cells to grow and divide indefinitely, and more aggressive forms of cancer.
According to the study, the expression of four different genes within the Ly6 family in multiple different cancers is strongly related to more severe prognoses for patients. This discovery could potentially open up avenues for more in-depth cancer research.
“The remarkable findings of increased expression of Ly6 family members and its positive correlation with poor outcome on patient survival in multiple cancer type indicate that Ly6 family members Ly6D, Ly6E, Ly6K and Ly6H will be an important targets in clinical practice as marker of poor prognosis and for developing novel therapeutics in multiple cancer type,” the abstract reads.
Senior Researcher and Assistant Professor of Oncology Geeta Upadhyay sought to determine whether or not there was a trend regarding Ly6 gene expression and cancer growth.
“We wanted to see if the gene-family of a specific system plays a role in cancer formation and progression or if it affects the clinical outcome,” Upadyay said.
According to Upadhyay, this family of genes can affect the clinical outcomes of patients’ years after treatment has been administered and remission has occurred. After analyzing data from several studies, researchers found that the Ly6 gene may be the culprit behind more aggressive cancers.
“The high expression of these genes associated with overall survival outcomes means that the more aggressive cancers which were not responding well were having these genes expressed,” Upadhyay said.
Upadhyay said that when a cancer is more aggressive, it spreads faster, is less responsive to therapeutic interventions and is consequently more lethal.
“So the most aggressive cancer after five years or after three years, these patients may not be alive. So, that what’s aggressive is, failing to respond to therapy,” she said.
The study’s analysis utilized bioinformatics, the use of different mathematical methods to process data obtained from other biological studies, to examine data from 130 other studies.
Innovation Center for Biomedical Informatics researcher and co-author of the paper Yuriy Gusev said that although the sheer volume of data available on gene expression and cancer aggressiveness makes conducting an overarching study difficult, bioinformatics enables scientists to make sense of the results of several experiments within a single given context.
“It is basically a multidisciplinary field where people apply different kinds of computational methods — computers to analyze and interpret data which are generated modern biotechnologies,” Gusev said. “Instead of doing one experiment, it is equivalent to doing 130 different projects at the same time in three months.
Upadhyay added that while the research results point to a correlation between the Ly6 family of genes and cancer prognosis, the exact mechanism of how these genes work is still not known to researchers.
“As of now, we can say that this paper gives important information about the gene expression and survival outcome of cancer stem cell genes but we don’t know the real mechanism,” Upadhyay said.
According to Gusev, the study was the summer project of graduate student Linlin Luo (GRD ’15). Under Gusev’s and Upadhyay’s mentorship, Luo was able to process data over the summer and successfully have her results published in a magazine.
“Together we supervised this bright young student and she was able to, in three months, generate so much data that we sent out a paper and it was very quickly accepted and made the news!” Gusev said.
Luo has already graduated and is not currently doing research at the Georgetown University Medical Center. She did not respond to requests for comment.
Upadhyay expressed hope that, in the future, drugs can be developed specially to target cancers in which Ly6 genes have been expressed, while excluding normal cells from the effects of treatment.
“The idea is that it will be that these molecules will be expressed on the cell surface so they are exposed to an incoming drug which can specifically bind to these proteins and leave the normal cells alone,” Upadhyay said.
Gusev predicted that new discoveries could potentially be made from existing data using bioinformatics.
“We are basically talking about a treasure trove – a gold mine of really well-developed information that just needs to be analyzed to find new relationships, basically new biological knowledge,” Gusev said.
