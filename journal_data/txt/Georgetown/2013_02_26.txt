Martin Iguchi, dean of the School of Nursing and Health Studies, will travel to Japan as a member of the U.S.-Japan Council’s 2013 Japanese American Leadership Delegation from March 8 to 13.
Since 2000, the JALD program has sent delegations of 10 Japanese Americans, all of whom are leaders in their respective fields, to meet with Japanese leaders to exchange ideas and strengthen the relationship between the two countries, both important trading partners to one another.
“I see this as an opportunity to highlight the work that we are doing globally as well as looking to develop additional opportunities,” Iguchi said. “The mission really is to build stronger ties with one of the primary trading partners with the U.S.”
Iguchi was selected for this year’s delegation in December 2012 because of his track record of leadership and knowledge in medical research. His research has special relevance because of the challenges Japan is facing after the 2011 earthquake and ensuing nuclear crisis.
“He was a great bridge between education and health,” U.S.-Japan Council Senior Communications Manager Laura Hayes said. “He has really expressed interest in forming partnerships down the line with Japanese counterparts in the area of health.”
For the first time this year, the delegation will travel to Fukushima Prefecture, the region most affected by both the 2011 nuclear crisis and earthquake. Arriving on the second anniversary of the incident, the delegation will participate in a symposium about recovery efforts, disaster management and revitalization of the region.
In addition to U.S.-Japanese relations and energy policies following the 2011 nuclear disaster, the delegation will address rising tensions with China and South Korea over disputed islands, immigration policy, economic policy and the growth of nonprofit business in Japan.
“I think it’s a really positive step for any entity, governmental or business, to speak with individuals from other cultures to better understand how their world views might be different,”
Iguchi said.
Iguchi said that the delegation was helpful to Toyota during its mass recalls in 2009 and 2010.
“The politicians and business leaders find that the feedback from a diverse group of Japanese Americans is useful in understanding how Americans are thinking about their country,” Iguchi said. “A few years ago during the crisis at Toyota, with their sudden acceleration, there was a lot of very frank discussion. They were able to help Toyota better understand how the American consumers were perceiving their response to the issue.”
Apart from his role as dean of the NHS, Iguchi is an adjunct behavioral scientist at the RAND Corporation, where he formerly served as the director of the Drug Policy Research Center. He has conducted extensive research about drug addiction, drug policy, the criminal justice system, health disparities and HIV transmission.
The delegation will also meet with Japan’s political and business leaders in Tokyo, including ShinzoAbe, the new Prime Minister, and members of the Japanese National Diet, the country’s parliament.
“The whole point of this program is to go to Japan and while they are meeting with high-ranking individuals from all sectors of society … [and] to build people-to-people connections,” Hayes said. “It’s a two-way street; we want them to bring lessons home from Japan and share knowledge for the U.S.”
The JALD program allows members of the delegation to gain a better understanding of how each country is viewed by the other, according to Iguchi.
Hayes said that the U.S.-Japan Council hopes the delegates will maintain their relationships after returning from the trip.
“I think we both believe Japanese Americans play this unique catalytic role in maintaining a strong and vibrant U.S.-Japan relationship,” Hayes said.
Iguchi added that he hopes the trip will not only strengthen ties between Japan and the United States, but also allow him to promote Georgetown and the NHS abroad.

Over a month after the auction for the Georgetown West Heating Plant began Jan. 18, the bidding for the historic building has reached $15.5 million and continues to rise.
The plant, located on a two-acre site at 1021 29th St. N.W., is owned by the United States General Services Administration. The building itself is 20,000 square feet and has eight stories.
Bidders must pay an initial deposit of $500,000 to participate in the auction and must bid in increments of at least $200,000.
The auction entered a soft closing period Feb. 19, meaning that it will close if 24 hours pass without a new bid.
As of press time, the property had received over 30 bids from five different potential buyers with the highest bid at little over $15.5 million.
Marc Waddill, senior vice president for government services at commercial real estate firm Jones Long LaSalle, which has been hired by the GSA to market the plant, could not predict how high the auction will go.
“The entire auction process and the framework behind it is to encourage competition and maximum price,” Waddill said.
While anonymous bidding makes it difficult to speculate which firms are interested in the property,Waddill said that interested buyers are likely large D.C. developers who intend to completely convert the facility’s use.
Potential companies that may be driving up the property price could include real estate developersEastBanc, Hines and Akridge, among others, according to local news blog Georgetown Patch, which based its findings on companies who had attended an Oct. 2012 industry meeting regarding the heating plant sale.
Although no one has won the auction yet, local politicians are already expressing concern about what will be built on the heating plant site.
Last summer, Councilman Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) wrote a letter with interest group Friends of the Georgetown Waterfront Park asking GSA Administrator Dan Tangherlini to require restrictions that would require the future owner of the property to leave the southern half of the property vacant for a public park.
“[Evans] is very supportive of seeing this being put toward some sort of neighborhood productive use,” said Ruth Warner, Evans’ committee clerk.
However, GSA Deputy Press Secretary Dan Cruz said that construction on the property will be a matter of negotiation between the new owner and the District government.
“The future use of the site will be determined by negotiations between the successful bidder and the D.C. government, which is responsible for establishing appropriate zoning for the site and administering various regulatory and planning procedures,” Cruz said.
Whoever purchases the property must also contend with the site’s historic status, which includes obtaining permits and approval from the Old Georgetown Board and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts for any changes to the site appearance.
In addition, it will be the buyer’s responsibility to treat any environmental consequences of redevelopment. A Human Health and Risk Assessment completed in 2011 stated that there would be no unacceptable risks to chemicals in soil and groundwater samples, but a December 2012 Final Environmental Assessment by the GSA stated that runoff during construction could indirectly impact Rock Creek or the C&O Canal and the area’s floodplain.
Cruz declined to comment on the potential environmental impact of redevelopment.
The GSA is selling the property as part of an effort by the Obama administration to use federal real estate more efficiently and eliminate unneeded property from government books, according to the auction website. The heating plant, built in 1948, was previously used as an industrial steam generating plant but has been out of use since 2000.

After President Obama proposed to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $9.00 per hour in his State of the Union Address, D.C. officials have begun to consider the effects of this wage increase on the local economy, including the possibility of raising the minimum wage in D.C. beyond the federal government’s new benchmark.
Under the D.C. Minimum Wage Act Revision Act of 1992, the city’s minimum wage is set permanently at one dollar above federal minimum wage. The District’s minimum wage currently stands at $8.25 per hour and would increase to $10 per hour if the federal proposal is passed by Congress.
Mayor Vincent Gray has said that he supports an increase of the minimum wage and would even consider measures to independently raise it in D.C. if Congress does not do so.
“From a workers’ perspective, it’s a good thing,” Gray told The Washington Post. “If you work 2,000 hours each year, that still only puts you at $20,000 a year, which is very challenging economically.”
Some worry that changing the district’s minimum wage policy could hurt local businesses and cause unemployment to rise.
“Our minimum wage is set at one dollar more than the federal rate, and this rule was adopted with good reason. I support the continuation of that policy,” D.C. Councilmember Jack Evans, the Chairman of the Finance and Revenue Committee, wrote in an email. “It is a tough but important balance to make sure that we don’t inadvertently reduce the number of jobs available by increasing the costs on our small businesses or impairing our competitive position.”
Many entry-level student jobs on campus, such as student guards, some clerical assistants and student assistants at Lauinger Library, are paid minimum wage. Dean of Student Financial Services Patricia McWade expressed doubt that a higher minimum wage would result in fewer employment opportunities for students on campus.
“Georgetown depends a great deal on student employment,” McWade said. “I would imagine that most departments would make the case to keep hiring as many students as they have been, assuming they need them all. I don’t think that this is going to have much of a negative effect on our students or their ability to get jobs on campus.”
Economists are divided on the validity of concerns about unemployment effects resulting from wage increases.
In a January report, William Wascher of the Federal Reserve Board and University of California, Irvine economists David Neumark and J.M. Ian Salas concluded that the overall evidence warns of a tradeoff between higher wages and unemployment, but others have said that the proposed wage increase is small enough to result in minimal job loss.
Economics professor James Albrecht said that typical supply-demand model would not be able to accurately depict what would happen if minimum wage increased.
“Workers aren’t like bananas — workers are very heterogeneous and jobs are very heterogeneous,” Albrecht said. “This sort of market clearing supply-demand model isn’t a very good picture of that market.”
He also cited empirical studies comparing markets where the minimum wage was increased and markets where it remained the same. In these cases, he said, there were few negative effects associated with an increase in the minimum wage.
“My reading of the evidence is that at least for minimum wages at the level we’re talking about in the [United States], it is hard to believe that the unemployment effects are going to be very large at all,” he said.
Some Georgetown students paid minimum wage say that the current pay is fair for them but that the proposal would be significant for full-time workers supporting a family.
“That would be good for the community, just because the living expenses of D.C. are very high as compared to other cities,” Johanny Lopez (SFS ’15), a student guard at Village C West, said. “For the job I’m doing it’s fair; for other people in the city, maybe it’s not.”
“The pay is pretty fair for what I’m doing,” Erik Sutton (SFS ’16), a student guard at Lauinger Library, said. “But I’m happy because it’s more money in my pocket.”

With Georgetown’s Feb. 20 announcement that the Healey Family Foundation will make a major donation to the New South Student Center, plans for the center’s construction are underway.
The Healey Family Student Center will cost approximately $21 million, $10.7 million of which has already been raised. The amount of the gift from the Healey Family Foundation has not been disclosed, but the building will bear the family’s name.
The foundation facilitates the philanthropy of Thomas (C ’64) and Meg Healey, their son Jeremy (COL ’95) and his wife Megan Healey (COL ’95) and Megan and John Hagerty, daughter and son-in-law of Thomas and Meg. They are of no relation to University President Fr. Patrick Healy, S.J., the namesake of Healy Hall.
The center will include a central “great room,” a pub, a terrace and space for study groups and dance studios, along with the Students of Georgetown, Inc.’s proposed salad and smoothie shop.
The Corp polled students about this storefront in Sellinger Lounge on Thursday. The service, tentatively named “The Corp New South Student Center Salad and Smoothie Shop,” is expected to launch in fall 2014 when the student center opens. It will serve made-to-order and pre-made sandwiches and salads, along with yogurt and baked goods. Drink selections will include smoothies, coffee, soda and iced tea.
“What we’re really trying to do is bring The Corp to the next level,” CEO Michael West (COL ’13) said. “We want a very fresh, healthy feel.”
According to draft floor plans, seating will consist of two long tables, one against a wall and another in the center of the store. Based on the floor plan, the new service appears to be larger than The Corp’s current coffee shops, and according to West, the store occupies over 2,000 sq. feet.
According to Director of Marketing Keaton Bedell (COL ’13), The Corp is working with the university and Restaurant Consultants, Inc., a food service development company, to develop the designs.
“We spent a lot of time asking ‘What do Hoyas want this to be?’” incoming Director of Marketing Emily Coch (COL ’15) said of the informal survey. “The idea of this is for students to come and comment on what they want.”
Staffers asked passing students about current food service methods on campus, such as the buffet and made-to-order stations in O’Donovan Hall. Positive responses were recorded on Post-its that were subsequently pasted on a board in a representation of what students preferred.
Students were also asked about restaurant ambiance, which could be anything from open and upscale to casual and cozy.
“Someplace like Baked & Wired is more homey, but you’re not going to have a big meeting there,”Coch said.
However, West said that The Corp’s location would likely be secondary to the New South Pub.
Members of the Healey family did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Last Friday, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson held the semester’s first collaborative luncheon, an informal meeting run by his office to promote an ideas exchange between group leaders and senior administrators. Last week’s discussion centered on one of the university’s most persistent challenges: town-gown relations.
Despite various concessions last semester, including the elimination of registration for on-campus parties and the announcement that Magis Row would no longer house students, tensions between neighbors and students still run high. The university’s top-down communications campaign encouraging students to be less rowdy when out at night continues to be disregarded, but student cooperation can be harnessed if the right channels are utilized.
Georgetown’s social life — officially or unofficially — is largely organized through student groups and clubs. If club leadership, which often already appoints positions for planning and execution of social gatherings, were to take a more active role in promoting appropriate neighborly conduct, residents of the Georgetown neighborhood might find themselves less frequently disrupted by the sound of loud groups of students. This is why events like Olson’s collaborative luncheons provide a fitting forum for such improvements.
But the university has to keep its end of the bargain, too, namely by faithfully following through on the Healey Student Center pub. Providing an on-campus locale for undergraduates will be an important contingency in keeping students from eliciting chagrin from the university’s neighbors. To be effective, however, the university must continue to keep student leaders involved in the planning process of the pub and carry that through into management and staffing.
The ongoing conflict with Georgetown’s neighbors is more a reflection of the school’s location than of particularly disruptive students. The views and priorities of students will rarely align with those of the university’s neighbors, but a compromise can be reached if cooperation from all parties involved is prioritized.

The Future Leaders Council of the American Civil Liberties Union of the Nation’s Capital held an event Friday on civil rights issues, primarily those concerning Washington, D.C., in an effort to increase the group’s visibility to college and high school students.
“We really just want to get the ACLU out there to the community, have better visibility and create an engaging atmosphere where people our age can learn about some really serious issues,” ZoeDobkin (SFS ’16), chair of the Future Leaders Council and organizer of the event, said.
Speakers talked about D.C.’s push for statehood, online privacy rights and the high number of students who drop out of public schools and enter the criminal system.
“As a young person that’s involved in politics and in public service I want to speak to the virtues of getting involved in service and taking risks to have a career that reflects your values,” Nate Bennett-Fleming, the District of Columbia’s shadow representative, said.
The shadow representative is recognized as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives by the District but not by the federal government. The District also has a non-voting congressional delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), who is allowed to propose legislation but cannot vote.
“Six hundred thousand people live here, but we don’t participate in American democracy and we don’t have a voice in Congress,” Bennett-Fleming said.
Josh Burch, who runs the organization Neighbors United for D.C. Statehood, also added that representation was crucial to the rights of D.C. citizens.
“Everyone above 18 has equal rights as U.S. citizens, except for those of us that live in the shadows of the nation’s capital,” he said. “We need to build up a grassroots network of young people in all eight wards to tell Congress we want full and equal treatment.”
Khaliah Barnes, a lawyer at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, discussed Internet privacy rights at the event.
“I’d like [students] to understand the landscape of student privacy on the Internet, their rights concerning their information and how it’s disseminated over the Internet,” she said.
Barnes emphasized the importance of awareness during her speech, mentioning that both a user’s and his or her friends’ Facebook privacy settings affect the visibility of posted material.
William Lawson, a member of the Phelps Stokes’ National Homecomers Academy, an organization that helps homecomers — convicted criminals who are re-entering society — adjust to life after being released from prison, talked about his experience with the school-to-prison pipeline, which refers to the phenomena of students leaving public schools and later entering the juvenile and criminal system.
“I directly have a relationship with this subject, being a homecomer  — I went to jail at an early age,” he said. “When you start thinking about the school-to-prison pipeline, they don’t talk about it too much, but it’s a true reality affecting a lot of young disadvantaged kids in the District of Columbia.”
Some students who attended the event said it opened their eyes to the District’s problems.
“I felt the event was informative and engaging. It captured many of the problems faced by D.C. as well as the solutions the city needs,” Austin Baker (SFS ’16) said. “Following the event I hope to take a closer look at the D.C. public school system to see what is actually being done to address these problems.”
For those in the audience who were new to the District, the event also served as an introduction to local issues.
“I really enjoyed the presentation because, being new to D.C., it allowed me to become aware of issues I didn’t even know existed before, such as the D.C. statehood concern,” Zoe Rosen (COL ’16) said.
