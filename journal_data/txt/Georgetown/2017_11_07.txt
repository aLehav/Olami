Former President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68) made his widely anticipated return to the Hilltop on Monday afternoon, lecturing a tightly packed Gaston Hall on his view of today’s global political climate and the role of government in an increasingly interconnected world.
“What are our responsibilities to each other, in an age of unprecedented interdependence and globalization?” Clinton said. “If you put up a wall, you might be able to keep people out, but you can’t keep the internet out, you can’t keep the ideas out.”
Clinton’s keynote address concluded a four-day symposium titled “Clinton 25: Georgetown Reflects on the Vision of Bill Clinton,” which marked the 25th anniversary of Clinton’s election in 1992. The event, hosted by the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service, comprised a series of panel discussions on Clinton’s domestic policy, foreign policy and public service.
Clinton said the interconnected world requires inclusivity on economic, social and political fronts to eradicate the harmful “us-versus-them” mentality that pervades politics today.
“Do you believe in a positive-sum future, a dynamic, bigger, better, more inclusive one? Or a zero-sum future, where economics is static and there’s a limited amount of social capital and cultural standing to go around, so there must always be a loser in order for someone to win?” Clinton asked.
According to Clinton, if and how we collectively think about our future determines our ability to meet the most pressing global challenges, from climate change to technology and cybersecurity threats.
“The only way to think about it in a country as great as ours, the only sensible way to work toward a more perfect union, is to work toward inclusive economics, inclusive societies, inclusive cultures and inclusive politics. And that includes people who don’t vote with us — and may not even like us,” Clinton said.
An interdependent world requires national policymakers to engage with the global community and work together to counter common threats, Clinton argued.
“You can build all the walls you want, but we can’t escape each other. It won’t affect cyberterrorism; it won’t affect the spreading of radical ideology, or inclusive, caring communities. The physical, in this case, is not as important as the mental,” Clinton said.
This address was the final installment of “The Clinton Lectures,” a four-part series devoted to exploring the people, events, lessons and guiding principles that have shaped his career in public service. The series, which began in 2013, examines the framework for a lifetime spent championing the ideas espoused by Clinton’s undergraduate professor Carroll Quigley: that tomorrow can be better than today and that every individual has a personal, moral responsibility to make it so.
Clinton said that he is convinced he would not have become president had he not attended Georgetown and that he still feels influenced by the lessons he learned at Georgetown, nearly 50 years after graduating. The notion that individuals are responsible for the success of the future is an impactful lesson that he has carried with him since his undergraduate days.
“That’s a pretty heavy dose to lay on an 18-year-old,” Clinton said. “But I remember it well, all these long years later. And I’m grateful that I heard it.”
The idea of combating harmful polarization was a common theme throughout Clinton’s talk, as he described a “cultural shift” that occurred around the time of President Nixon’s resignation in 1974 and included 12 consecutive years of Republican presidents. According to Clinton, the shift was only the beginning of a long legacy of polarization in America.
“When I ran in ’92, it was rather a lot like 2016,” Clinton said. “We had income inequality, we had alienation, we had unequal opportunities and we had a lot of social division. And that’s why I came to Georgetown. I said ‘Look, there’s a lot of social inequality, and I think we can do something about it, but I don’t think we can do anything until we start coming together.’”
Clinton also urged the audience to vote in the upcoming midterm elections, saying that it was one of the best ways for young people to get involved with politics today.
Building off the theme of an interdependent world, Clinton discussed the importance of immigration and emphasized how our similarities, rather than our differences, should drive not only our politics but our interactions with the world around us.
“We have got to resolve the basic question — and you have got to resolve in your own mind — which is more important: our basic differences or our common humanity? We’re all 99.5 percent the same,” Clinton said. “And yet most of political discourse today is focused on the half a percent of you that’s different. Interesting. If everyone in America knew that one fact, you think it would make any difference? It might. Especially if you told it to somebody that doesn’t look like you.”
Clinton explained how he had worked with former President George W. Bush on immigration reform and that he was “ashamed” that more substantive policy changes had not come out of their efforts.


The former president also discussed the role of politics in a broader sense, saying that leaders must ultimately strive to leave the country in a better state than it was before, despite the challenges they may face in doing so.
“Remember that all that matters in the end is if people are better off after you finished than they were when you started,” Clinton said.
Clinton concluded on a hopeful note, saying that genuine effort is the most important part of addressing the divisive challenges of today’s world.

“I can say to you, having lost as well as won over a long lifetime, that losing isn’t the end of the world. I will tell you what [Hillary Clinton] and I drilled into our daughter: The important thing is to get caught trying,” Clinton said. “It’s worth it. We’ve got to have a united country. We’ve got to have a more perfect union, and an us-versus-them is a dead end in an interdependent world.”

The leadership and negotiating skills of former President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68) helped him actualize his vision of putting people first in his policies, said three Clinton White House chiefs of staff at a panel forming part of the “Clinton 25: Georgetown Reflects on the Vision of Bill Clinton” symposium Monday.
“He was willing to do the tough things you have to do to end up with a principled compromise,” said Erskine Bowles, who served from 1997 to 1998 as White House chief of staff, regarding Clinton’s leadership ability.
Bowles spoke alongside Mack McLarty and John Podesta, who recently served as campaign manager for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential bid. Their comments came during the “Clinton 25” symposium’s “Vision of Leadership and Service” panel, which focused on Clinton’s leadership style and belief in the role of government as a tool to help people.
The symposium was hosted by the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service.
McLarty said that governance without vision and a plan does not get results, but that Clinton was motivated by deep convictions that characterized his presidency.
“He had a vision of what he wanted to do,” McLarty said. “It was under the themes of putting people first.”
“It was what centered the administration. He knew who he was fighting for,” Podesta said. “And through thick and thin, when times were good and times were bad, all he cared about was could he deliver.”
Bowles said Clinton would often arrive in the morning with various newspaper clippings of problems people faced across the country and a note reading, “Erskine, go fix this.”
McLarty attributed much of Clinton’s desire to help others and put people first to his experiences in his grandparents’ shop in Arkansas.
“He spent many hours in grandfather’s store, who they had as a clientele, lower-income people working hard to make ends meet, and he saw that firsthand and saw his grandparents trying to help them,” McLarty said. “That influenced his early feelings about public service and how he related to other people.”
Republicans attempted to shut down the government twice in 1995, expecting Clinton to give in, but Clinton’s resolve in refusing to let Republicans block grant Medicaid worked to his benefit during budget negotiations in 1997, according to Bowles.
“They found out they were dealing with a guy who had a real backbone. A guy who would stand up and fight for what he believed,” Bowles said.
Balancing the budget, one of the hallmarks of Clinton’s presidency, was an achievement that McLarty, who had known Clinton since kindergarten and who served as his chief of staff from 1993 until 1994, said even he was unsure anyone could achieve the task.
Podesta, who served as chief of staff from 1998 until the end of Clinton’s second term in 2001, also said that many doubted that the former president would successfully balance the budget.
“Our plan was to balance the budget, and balance it in a way that respected our values. And to do that, we had to play the long game. We had to have the vision … we had to be really willing to work at it day in, day out,” Bowles said.
Clinton brought people together and made concessions to realize his goal, Bowles said.
The Clinton administration managed to secure an entitlement in 1997 creating the Children’s Healthcare Insurance Program, which decreased uninsured children from over 14 percent down to 5 percent, an effort Bowles said brought Clinton joy.
“When [Podesta] and I walked into that office and told him we had a deal, he looked at me and listened; we told him what we got,” Bowles said. “Boy, when we told him we got that health care insurance for 5 million poor kids, I’d never seen a guy light up so much, because that’s why he ran. Those are the priorities and principles under which he governed. That was his true north.”
Though Podesta, Bowles and McLarty all acknowledged the distinctions today in the political landscape regarding globalism and fiscal responsibility, Podesta said he believes tying the success of the country to the success of working people rather than solely to the national economy was a lasting principle of the Clinton presidency and vision that continues to influence the Democratic Party.
“Central to Clinton’s economic theory was the success of the middle class, attacking income inequality,” Podesta said. “The heart of the Democratic Party still believes in that.”

“Hard-headedness and empathy” — this seemingly paradoxical combination of qualities informed the foreign policy of former President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68) at a time when the United States was surging as a unilateral world power, argued foreign policy experts Monday in Copley Formal Lounge.
The 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union saw the erosion of the bilateral system of international relations that governed the post-World War II world, poising the United States to increase its influence under Clinton’s lead. Clinton’s extraversion and persistence helped to achieve that goal, according to three experts who worked with his administration.
Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo and former Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott comprised a panel on Clinton’s vision of the world and the foreign policy agenda it inspired. The event, co-sponsored by the School of Foreign Service and moderated by SFS Dean Joel Hellman, was part of the “Clinton 25: Georgetown Reflects on the Vision of Bill Clinton” symposium hosted by the Institute of Politics and Public Service.
As an SFS graduate and a Rhodes scholar, Clinton had studied international relations extensively by the time he arrived at the Oval Office. Talbott said Clinton’s focus was ensuring lasting stability.
“He came into office wanting to do everything he could to make sure that the Cold War was over and that post-Soviet Russia would be able to succeed,” Talbott said.
Albright said that through the 1994 Partnership for Peace, a NATO program aimed at increasing trust in European and former Soviet states, Clinton showed Russia a sign of respect.
At the negotiating table, the panelists said, Clinton pursued a “mission rich in diplomacy and engagement.” He complemented this mission with a proclivity for empathy, Zedillo said, citing Clinton’s support for the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement to improve the region’s economy.
NAFTA, which set up a free trade zone among Canada, the United States and Mexico, is currently being renegotiated by the administration of President Donald Trump, who called the agreement “the worst trade deal” during his 2016 presidential campaign.
Clinton believed it was in the national interest to bring financial stability to the region, Zedillo said. The former president sidestepped the U.S. Congress in 1995 to authorize a $20 billion loan to Mexico through the Department of the Treasury.
Clinton’s administration is also remembered for the 2000 Camp David summit among the American, Israeli and Palestinian premiers, during which the parties attempted to broker territorial disputes, the status of refugees and the elimination of Israeli settlements in the West Bank.
Despite not being able to reach a watershed agreement, Clinton aimed to foster understanding between the parties, according to Albright, who participated in the 13-day negotiations.
“He made it a point of sitting down both with [Palestinian Authority] Chairman [Yasser] Arafat and with [Israeli] Prime Minister Ehud Barak and made them put themselves into the shoes of the other party,” Albright said. “That was kind of his way of saying, ‘We have to solve this together; it had to be win-win and not zero-sum.’”
Perhaps one of the Clinton administration’s most notable foreign policy moments remains the 1994 Agreed Framework with North Korea, through which an international consortium was set to replace North Korea’s plutonium reactor with two light-water reactors.
The talks broke down after incoming Secretary of State Colin Powell of the George W. Bush administration “got hauled into the White House” and was told the negotiations must cease, according to Albright.
The Clinton administration also drew heavy criticism from its decision not to intervene in Rwanda, where 800,000 members of the Tutsi ethnic group were massacred by Hutus in 1994.
Talbott, who went on to preside over the Brookings Institution for 15 years, said Clinton was also instrumental in convincing former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to de-escalate conflict at the India-Pakistan border in 1999. The former president spent his Fourth of July weekend negotiating the demilitarization of the border, averting possible nuclear war.
But it is impossible to encompass eight years of foreign policy in one three-person panel, Hellman said. The conversation thus “wasn’t so much an assessment of the era as an assessment of the man” and how Clinton used his global influence.
In international relations parlance, this analysis of an individual’s vision has a name: the great man or woman theory, which states that foreign policy can be explained by the impact of individuals.
“Russia had a critical role to play in the world and … how it used its strength and potential was largely a function first of [former Russian President Boris] Yeltsin and then [President Vladimir] Putin taking it in a different direction,” Hellman said, echoing Talbott’s assessment that appointing Putin was Yeltsin’s biggest regret.
For Albright, the foreign affairs lesson from the Clinton presidency is the linkage between international engagement and domestic policy gains: The United States needed to become an “indispensable nation” in the eyes of the world to advance its own interests.
“What I’m worried about is that we are about to become the dispensable nation, where nobody thinks that we do have a role to play,” Albright said. “I would hope that the president, the current one, would understand that what he is trying to accomplish requires the United States to be engaged in a respectful way and stop tweeting.”

Quite embarrassing for a Catholic University honoring a President that was so repulsive in his behavior. If Catholic he would not be able to receive  Communion. Penance precedes Communion.

Did you or do you now support Donald J. Trump as President of the United States?

A return to a less polarized political climate should follow the example set by the bipartisan style of former President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68), argued top Clinton White House advisers at a “Clinton 25: Georgetown Reflects on the Vision of Bill Clinton” panel in Copley Formal Lounge on Monday.
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D), formerly a senior adviser for Clinton, said his one-time boss redefined the political dichotomy: Instead of focusing on party divisions, he said, Clinton focused on progress.
“It wasn’t that he was a centrist; he reframed the debate about whether we were going forward or back,” Emanuel said.
Minyon Moore, director of White House political affairs for Clinton, said all presidents can use their bully pulpit to unite the country. According to Moore, President Donald Trump has instead used his influence as president to contribute to a polarized political climate.
“It starts at the top; it starts with the president. It is called a bully pulpit for a reason, because you can use that bully pulpit not to be a bully, but to raise the tone of this country, to bring us together,” Moore said. “The White House is the most audacious place you can work, and to lower it or to raise it is a choice, and it starts with the man in charge, or the woman in charge.”
The “Vision of America” panel was part of the “Clinton 25” symposium, hosted by the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service, celebrating the 25th anniversary of Clinton’s election. It preceded a keynote address by Clinton on Monday afternoon.
The panel included senior White House officials who reflected on the domestic agenda Clinton envisioned during his presidency. Speakers included Emanuel and Moore, as well as Bruce Reed, chief domestic policy adviser for Clinton, and Maria Echaveste, Clinton’s deputy White House chief of staff.
Interim Dean of the McCourt School of Public Policy Michael Bailey moderated the event.
Reed said hostility, which dominates Washington, D.C.’s current political environment, does not reflect the American people’s wishes. Though politicians in the District are divided, Reed said, the United States is not necessarily a divided country.
“What Clinton was able to do was show people in the suburbs and people in the city that they had the same concerns,” Reed said. “They were worried about quality of schools; they were worried about crime; they were worried about lack of opportunity and people not carrying their part of the load. And when you speak to people like that, then these partisan labels don’t matter as much.”
Individuals must take responsibility to transcend partisan barriers, Emanuel said.
“It’s also not just incumbent on elected leaders to do it. It’s incumbent upon other people, called citizens, to get engaged and listen to other people,” Emanuel said.
The panelists suggested obligatory public service, such as military service, could be used as a means to unite a polarized United States by encouraging diverse interaction. Mandating five months of national service could unify the American public, according to Emanuel.
“If you do believe, which I don’t, that we’re coming apart, but let’s accept that as a premise … you then need a defining experience and place where people together from all walks of life can serve a higher thing called America,” Emanuel said. “The most important thing we can do as a country, which Democrats and Republicans agree on, people in cities, suburbs, rural America agree on, is serving a place we want our children to inherit.”
In agreement with Emanuel, Echaveste said forms of service could empower more Americans to feel united.
“National service — where all of us had to serve in one way or another — would bring us together, because we would see each other as Americans, and not as these boxes,” Echaveste said.
Echaveste advocated for youth to get more involved in political processes more frequently.
“Jump in, take a chance, and find something you believe in,” Echaveste said. “Citizenship needs to be active, and not just on election day, but year-round.”
Reed said the combination of a long-term vision and capacity to execute constitutes a successful leader.
“My view of leadership is you have to be idealistic enough and principled enough to know why you’re doing what you’re doing, and ruthless enough to want to get it done,” Reed said. “If you look at successful presidents — Clinton, Lyndon Johnson, Lincoln, Roosevelt — they had both qualities.”
