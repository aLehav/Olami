To prepare for summer renovations that include the opening of an on-campus Chick-fil-A, several main campus dining locations are slated to close for the summer beginning in April and May.
As part of the Hoya Hospitality dining initiative, renovations to O’Donovan Hall began Thursday with the placement of temporary walls blocking the normal entrance to the top floor, though both floors of the hall remain open. More renovations are set to occur across campus, including in the Leavey Center and Hoya Court.
The dining initiative plans to close the Leavey Center Così on April 20, to be replaced by a new “sandwich concept” called Royal Jacket, according to a campuswide email by Associate Vice President for Auxiliary Business Services Joelle Wiese.
The changes are part of plans approved under the university’s 10-yearlong contract with Aramark, renewed in November, which includes plans to expand and improve options for students with meal plans. The new contract followed a yearlong deliberation process by university officials and students.
Hoya Court is slated to close May 14 to begin construction for Crop Chop, a salad and smoothie dining venue, and Chick-fil-A.
Eight days later, on May 22, Students of Georgetown, Inc. coffee shop Uncommon Grounds plans to close at its current location and begin relocation to the second floor of the Barnes & Noble bookstore, which will remain open during renovations.
The new location for Uncommon Grounds will connect the bookstore and the esplanade and include a performance space and outdoor seating. When it opens, it will mark the first partnership between Barnes & Noble and a non-Starbucks company. The Corp CEO Melina Hsiao (COL ’18) previously raised concerns about traffic flow to Corp businesses during and after construction.
Leo’s will fully close for construction May 22, with a food service tent outside the entrance of McDonough Gymnasium providing food for students. The air-conditioned tent will serve visitors and students with the same options currently offered at Leo’s. Students and visitors will be permitted to use meal plan swipes, debit dollars, credit cards and cash there. The tent is scheduled to operate from 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. throughout the summer.
Three food trucks will also provide service to the Georgetown community this summer outside Harbin Hall on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays starting June 6.
Among the dining operations remaining open for service throughout the summer are Bulldog Tavern, Epicurean, Starbucks, Vital Vittles, The Hilltoss, the Faculty Club Restaurant, Marketplace Express, More Uncommon Grounds and Provisions on Demand Market at the medical center.
Construction on these projects is expected to be completed before the beginning of the fall semester, according to Wiese.

I am waiting with baited breath for the lgbt community to protest or at least have a kiss in over a Chick fil- A on campus. The company is Christian owned and had the nerve to say they believe marriage is between a man and a woman. There was a national kiss in, to support gay marriage held at Chick fil-As across the country a few years ago? Chick fil- A stock went up the next day.

“stock went up the next day” lol chick-fil-a is private, get out of here

Let me re phrase that. Their business boomed the following couple of weeks according to national news reports. Look it up yourself! Chik-fil-A has been targeted by the lgbt lobby simply for stating their belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. Has the Catholic Church had any gay weddings? Duquesne is currently under protest from some liberals for a Chik-fil-A on campus.

“Baited breath”. Sounds about right, you troll; get out of here with all your baiting.  (You mean “bated” as in diminished or abated.)    
Regardless of your breath situation, your premise is nonsensical. You’re sitting there in rapt anticipation that someone might have the audacity to protest a large company’s social policies? On a college campus?  This would be a surprise?  Or you’re so nervous with gleeful anticipation that the day after, other people will then conclusively disprove these gay sympathizers by eating chicken sandwiches in response? Because you read about this once before?  Is that how it works? Whoever spends the most money on lunch has our nation’s moral authority?  And America’s got its chicken eaters on speed dial, ready for dispatch at the slightest disturbance?  And the proof of your moral clarity in this is the absence of a strawman type of protest you just came up with here in the comments section?
What was wrong with your breath again?

Mike Flynn says 
April 20, 2017 at 11:10 am
I don’t know about gleeful anticipation or any of that other bilge your spewing off your two story soapbox? Personally, I don’t care what anybody does in the privacy of their own bedroom and gays should be entitled to legal marriage under the constitution. I do find it funny that the gay community tried to make a political statement by a kiss in and it backfired. No one wants to go to lunch and see either homosexual or heterosexual couples making out? 
So; sorry Pickles, if I ruffled your high moral standards the wrong way!

Washington, D.C., is the fifth-best U.S. region for millennials, ranking No. 1 in education, civic engagement and health, as well as No. 2 for quality of life, according to an April 4 ranking by WalletHub.
WalletHub, a D.C.-based personal finance website, compared all 50 states and the District based on 24 categories, including average monthly earnings, the number of reported depression cases and voter turnout rates.
The study found the average levels of education and health in the District make it an ideal region for millennials, an age group characterized as individuals born between 1981 and 1997.
However, the District performed poorly in affordability and economic health, ranking No. 46 and No. 20 in those categories, respectively.
States received a grade out of 100, with D.C. scoring 61.75, placing behind North Dakota, Minnesota, South Dakota and Iowa.
West Virginia, Mississippi and Alabama were ranked as the three worst states for millennials.
WalletHub used data from the U.S. Census Bureau, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Department of Housing and Urban Development to accumulate data to score the regions.
Richie Bernardo, the senior writer at WalletHub who authored the report, said millennials are now the largest generation in the United States and account for 21 percent of all consumer discretionary spending.
The report said millennials are less economically stable than their parents were at a similar age, a contributing factor in where millennials decide to live. WalletHub’s research found that millennials are earning 20 percent less than the Baby Boomer generation, which are adults between 53 and 71, did at the same age.
“The financial crisis remains a big part of the reason,” Bernardo wrote in the report. “Millennials have come of age and entered the workforce in the shadow of the Great Recession, significantly reducing their job prospects.”
WalletHub analyst Jill Gonzalez noted this inability to improve one’s personal economic situation has resulted in more millennials living at home.
“That’s why more and more of them are still living with their parents, on average, about a third of them,” Gonzalez said in an interview with The Hoya.
Gonzalez said D.C.’s low affordability hurt its ranking, but said there were reasons for optimism for millennials.
“D.C. is quite restrictive when it comes to affordability, but it still continues to offer some of the best opportunities for millennials when it comes to education, health and quality of life,” Gonzalez said. “D.C. will continue to attract millennials, even though it has a high cost of living.”
Joaquin McPeek, communications director for the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development, said the mayor’s office expected the result.
“We can point to a number of reasons, but most importantly because our economy is strong and we have good paying jobs,” McPeek said. “We’re rapidly expanding private sector jobs, and the District has all the elements that attract millennials.”
McPeek also said factors like easy access to public transportation and the ability to walk and bike to major attractions explain the millennial appeal of D.C., showing the city is no longer simply a government town.
“Millennials are opting less for ownership — home ownership and vehicles,” McPeek said. “We have one of the highest per capita park land in the country as well. It’s green, walkable, transit-friendly and bike-friendly, too.”

This article is a little misleading. First in education and health? Second in quality of life? The hook is “Best for millennials”? Exactly what is a millennial? It must be a rich white kid living in Georgetown or Chevy Chase? It must be exclusive to NW because if you venture out at night any where else your health along with quality of life is very questionable?

More than 60 different religious congregations have launched the DMV Sanctuary Congregation Network, a local initiative to provide support and resources to immigrants at risk of being detained or deported.
The group, based in the Washington, D.C.-Maryland-Virginia area and made up of Christian, Jewish, Muslim and other faith traditions, gathered March 21 at the Foundry United Methodist Church on 16th St. NW to announce the new coalition before marching to the White House to protest President Donald Trump’s immigration policies.
Among the network’s goals are preserving and expanding Washington, D.C.’s sanctuary city status and providing legal information to immigrants in the DMV area who fear raids from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.
Sanctuary cities are local municipalities that prohibit local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration agencies in apprehending individuals who have entered the country illegally when they are arrested for unrelated charges.
According to a statement from the Sanctuary DMV website, sanctuary cities should not comply with the Trump administration’s proposed immigration policies.
“They should actively and politically protect its most vulnerable populations, including those who are immigrants, undocumented, indigenous, Black, Muslim, Latino, women and LGBTQ+,” the statement reads.
The District has been a sanctuary city since former Mayor Vincent Gray (D) issued a declaration in 2011. In D.C., the Metropolitan Police Department is limited from cooperating with the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. MPD officers are also prohibited from ask about people’s immigration status and do not detain people for ICE unless a serious crime is involved, according to Sanctuary DMV.
Still, Sanctuary DMV maintains that sanctuary city status is not enough because of loopholes exempting federal agencies in D.C. from adhering to local law enforcement policies, resulting in both immigrants with and without documentation being deported.
Recent statements from Trump and increased ICE raids in major metropolitan areas including Chicago, New York and Washington, D.C., have motivated these religious congregations to offer aid, including physical shelter, free legal counsel and to host Know Your Rights workshops to educate people on how to handle interactions with the ICE.
Asma Hanif, a chaplain at member congregation Muslimat Al Nisaa Shelter, said her domestic violence and refugee ministry provides Muslim women experiencing homelessness or abuse a safe place to live. Hanif has been working on providing shelter to those in need for over three decades.
“I started out with that as a goal in mind,” Hanif said. “When I saw that there were so many individuals whose needs were not being met, that they were silent victims — that society was really not concerned about sheltering them because they had no family, no status, no resources, no nothing. That’s why I don’t get government money and I open up my home to be able to help them.”
In the District alone, ICE reported it had arrested 82 individuals over the course of five days in the DMV area, according to Fusion, a media company owned by Univision.
ICE announced that within the course of last week, it detained at least 367 individuals across the country.
Congressional Democrats last week introduced a bill to prohibit immigration officers from wearing any clothing that could identify them as “police.” The ban on using the term would apply to ICE and U.S. Border Patrol agents to distinguish local police departments from federal agencies in sanctuary cities.
Julia Jarvis, an ordained minister at the United Church of Christ, has participated in Sanctuary DMV’s meetings to help organize.
“I’ve been working with Sanctuary DMV, the organizing vehicle that supports, works with and tries to get a lot of clergy of all different faiths to come together to support and stand up for people who are going to the ICE check-ins and are worried that they are going to be deported in this climate, where people even without criminal backgrounds are being deported,” Jarvis said.
According to Jarvis, Sanctuary DMV currently has seven active cases. Three to four of them have ICE check-in meetings scheduled in May.
Laura Cunningham, pastor and head of staff at Western Presbyterian Church, said joining DMV Sanctuary was not a difficult decision for her congregation.
“It actually was not very controversial,” Cunningham said of the decision. “Once our congregation found out more, they realized it fit very well with our understanding of who we’re called to be as faithful people.”
In addition to working with Lutheran Social Services to help resettle refugees, Temple Sinai has also joined DMV Sanctuary. According to Rabbi Jonathan Roos, the congregation has already held Know Your Rights workshops and provided free legal aid.
Jarvis said people can provide aid to immigrants by getting trained in Know Your Rights programs, writing to Congress, raising money for legal fees, donating supplies to sanctuary communities and providing food and medical support.
“It’d be great if Georgetown and universities got involved,” Jarvis said. “Come to sanctuary meetings, find out when they are going to be and come to vigils to stand with these undocumented people. You don’t have to be ordained, you don’t have to be a lawyer, you don’t have to have any title, but just showing up is very powerful.”
The next DMV Sanctuary approved event will take place April 12 at Gravelly Point Park to protest the low wages of D.C. airport workers.

Another article showing the gross ignorance that abounds regarding President Trump’s Executive Orders to protect the American people from terrorists and criminals involved with drugs and sex trafficking… PLEASE PEOPLE, READ THE ORDERS. No one is at risk of deportation unless they commit crimes. Go to whitehouse.org to read them. Yes, more work for you than just blindly following along on a media sound bite, but you will be informed and have accurate information on which to base your conversations.

States must understand the linkages between climate change and security to foster better cooperation in climate change efforts, according to five international affairs experts at a summit in Gaston Hall on April 6.
The conference, organized by the Georgetown Initiative for Diplomatic Engagement and the School of Foreign Service, brought together five international practitioners to evaluate both the progress and future of international cooperation in mitigating climate change.
The summit, part of a series of events commemorating the upcoming SFS centennial anniversary, opened with a keynote address from former National Security Adviser Gen. James L. Jones (SFS ’66), who underscored the role of today’s diverse military methods in controlling climate-induced conflict.
“I will submit that the nexus between climate change and national security is the case study in the evolving nature of threats to which our country and our allies must adjust,” Jones said. “A new and more complicated global environment demands that we modernize our national security thinking.”
One of the priorities that must be at the forefront of this modernization, Jones said, “is updating the U.S. national security architecture and strategy to account for the pivotal role of food and energy, sufficiency and climate — and even human dignity — will play in our present and future of security.”
Jones, who led the United States’ military tours in Afghanistan and Iraq under former President Barack Obama from 2009 until 2010, also warned against the dangers of ideology when coupled with climate-induced conflict.
“The reality is that extreme poverty and extreme ideology make a lethal cocktail,” Jones said. “This interplay causes major challenges to every single one of our United States institutions stationed overseas.”
A panel of ambassadors examined recent efforts to reduce the adverse consequences of climate change following James’ address. The discussion included Ambassador of Barbados to the United States Selwin Hart, Ambassador of Denmark to the United States Lars Gert Lose and Ambassador of Germany to the United States Peter Wittig, and was moderated by Senior Vice President of the Center for Strategic and International Studies Kathleen Hicks.
In their opening remarks, the ambassadors explained the situation of their respective countries and their position vis-a-vis the international climate change regime, which is currently governed by the 2015 Paris Agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The Paris Agreement was ratified at the 21st Conference of Parties in Paris in April 2016 and focused on individualized commitments to reducing carbon emissions from 55 signatory nations as opposed to a one-size-fits-all solution.
Wittig emphasized the role Germany played in addressing climate change during its one-month rotating term as president of the United Nations Security Council.
“I decided that I wanted to introduce this topic of climate change and its repercussions on international peace and security,” Wittig said. “It’s not self-evident that it can be introduced on the agenda of the Security Council.”
Along with a bloc of African nations and small island developing states, Wittig helped to negotiate a UN Security Council presidential statement calling on states to address the threat of climate in conflict.
Lose said the 1973 oil crisis in Denmark, in which the country’s oil industry faced a sudden supply shock, is evidence of the effects of climate change on the economy and security.
“We had the major oil crisis and it spurred a security concern in Denmark because back then, 99 percent of our energy consumption was covered by imported fossil fuels and it led to a major economic recession,” Lose said. “We had major unemployment; we even had car-free Sundays and — trust me — this is when it became a security issue.”
Lose also emphasized the disproportionate effect of climate change on indigenous people living in Greenland. Though an autonomous constituent country, Greenland has been politically associated with the Kingdom of Denmark for more than a millennium.
“If you’re ever in doubt whether climate change is real go to Greenland, go to the arctic,” Lose said. “The ice cap is receding, ice poles are melting and this is completely changing the livelihoods of the indigenous population up there.”
Barbados has been hit especially hard by climate change due to its geography as a low-lying small island in the Caribbean, according to Hart.
“Ninety percent of all economic activity takes place within 1 mile of the coast line. So therefore, sea level rise, the increase in frequency of extreme weather events, has a devastating impact on the Caribbean,” Hart said. “And for those who think climate change is some future event, I’m here to say it’s happening now and it is getting worse.”
Hart also said state defense against climate change comes with a significant price tag.
“Nineteen of the major cities in the Caribbean are extremely vulnerable to sea level rise and for us to protect those cities it will require building 300 kilometers of sea walls and levees costing over $4.5 billion with an annual estimated maintenance cost of over $150 million,” Hart said. “These are resources that could be invested in health, education and other social goods.”
Collaboration from other countries with U.S. leadership has been vital to advancing the ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement, according to Hart.
“There is no other country that can drive innovation and technological change and development like the United States,” Hart said. “I’m hopeful the new administration will weigh the costs and benefits of its leadership and participation in this universal global move towards addressing climate change.”
The panelists also addressed the increased involvement of China on the international stage.
“China is very assertive in wanting to assume a leadership role,” Wittig said. “If the United States thinks of leaving its position, then China will step into the room and will act as a leading protagonist in the climate policy.”
According to Hart, it is in the global interest for the United States to maintain its involvement in climate change efforts.
“It is very concerning — and I can’t say this diplomatically — that there is this consideration of the United States not participating in the implementation of the Paris Agreement or developing the rulebook for the Paris Agreement,” Hart said. “We want the United States at the table to ensure that those rules remain strong.”

The university is introducing a new online training course about sexual assault and misconduct prevention for students this week as part of the university’s response to last year’s Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey.
The training program, launched as part of Sexual Assault Awareness Month, looks to increase education and bystander intervention. The survey showed 50.7 percent of respondents reported they did nothing to intervene when they witnessed a drunk person heading for a sexual encounter; 24.2 percent of respondents who witnessed such a situation indicated they did not know what to do.
All Georgetown undergraduates are expected to complete this course centering on sexual misconduct prevention on campus by April 21. The new course builds upon the training each first year student undergoes at the beginning of their first fall semester.
University President John J. DeGioia said the university must deepen its commitment to addressing sexual assault on campus.
“As members of the Georgetown community, each of us is responsible for establishing and maintaining an environment for everyone on our campus to thrive as they engage in their professional and academic pursuits and in their own personal growth,” DeGioia wrote in a campuswide email regarding this new training course.
The online format provides examples and scenarios more relevant to students who have lived on campus as well as allows a broader range of Georgetown students to learn more about sexual misconduct and the resources available on campus, according to Title IX Coordinator Laura Cutway.
“Now that students have more experience on campus, and given that April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, the University felt this was an appropriate time to share this training, reiterating our commitment to educating students on this important topic and reminding students of the resources available to them,” Cutway wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Georgetown University Student Association Safety and Sexual Assault Policy Team Chair Nina Young (SFS ’19) said she hopes the course will raise more awareness and encourage discussion of the issue on campus.
“Sexual assault, harassment, and relationship violence are issues that pervade all of our lives deeply, whether we recognize them or not, and deserve a closer look than a rushed training session for freshmen,” Young wrote in an email to The Hoya. “While we now have great programs through SAPE and our new Bystander Intervention courses, a lot of students still manage to rid themselves of the responsibility — and value — of this dialogue for various reasons.”
Young said the course demonstrates the work that Georgetown has yet to do in addressing sexual assault.
“What the student outside of these circles may not realize is that there is absolutely always more work to be done regarding campus and sexual misconduct,” Young wrote. “What may seem strangely-timed or overblown is simply an expression of the way sexual assault and relationship violence cuts deep into the heart of this campus.”

Six Georgetown University students traveled to Georgia’s 6th Congressional District to observe local campaigns for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives as part of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service’s #HoyasInGA trip this month.
The three-day trip connected the students to campaign staffers, party leaders and media figures focused on the district’s special election to replace Tom Price’s seat, who was appointed secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services by President Donald Trump.
Georgetown alumnus Jon Ossoff (SFS ’09) is running as a Democrat in the special election to fill the seat. Ossoff has come under fire for videos from his time at Georgetown that have resurfaced.
Ossoff has raised $8.3 million for the election, more than any other candidate has ever raised for an election in the 6th Congressional District, according to the Chicago Tribune. A Democrat has not held the seat for nearly four decades.
The students, who were selected through an application process, met with campaign staffers, attended a debate amongst the top five Republican contenders for the party nomination and met candidates including Ossoff and Judson Hill, a Republican.
GU Politics Chief of Staff Hanna Hope, who organized the trip, said a big reason for the project was to allow students to take part in a unique campaign process.
“Since the special election in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District is the first competitive race after the 2016 Presidential election, coupled with a Hoya as one of the candidates, it seemed like a great opportunity to take a group of Georgetown students to Georgia and give them the chance to experience the energy and excitement of a hotly contested special election first hand,” Hope wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Jack Dobkin (SFS ’19), one of the students who participated in the trip, said he has previously volunteered in other Georgia political campaigns, including Michelle Nunn’s 2014 Senate run in Georgia and Jason Carter’s 2014 gubernatorial race.
“While I was home for spring break, I was able to volunteer with Jon Ossoff’s campaign and went out canvassing for him as much as I could before heading back up to D.C.,” Dobkin wrote in an email to The Hoya. “When I heard about the opportunity to return to the district and get greater insight into the race, the campaigns and the candidates, I couldn’t have jumped at the chance faster.”
Hope said the trip was a unique learning opportunity for students who have been focusing on government in their academic careers, but perhaps have not had the chance to participate in the field.
“This was a great opportunity for students to take what they learn in the classroom about campaigns and elections, and see how that measures up on the ground. It was also an exciting chance to see how the American electorate is responding to everything, since we’re living within the D.C. bubble,” Hope wrote.
Dobkin said the race is surprisingly competitive because Trump’s victory in the district was a smaller margin than Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s margin of victory in 2012.
“What normally might not get much attention due to the safely-conservative nature of the district has turned into a heated race that people nationwide have their eyes on because of the unusually tight vote this November,” Dobkin wrote.
According to Dobkin, the rushed nature of the campaigns is one of the main obstacles campaign staffers and candidates must overcome in order to run a successful campaign.
“The operations of the campaigns, as well as the press, all had to launch into everything they would normally do over a span of months or even a year in just a few weeks,” Dobkin wrote. “And further, given the national attention that this race has been getting, there is unusually high activity in this race as compared to a ‘typical’ special election, meaning that all of these actors are dealing with more demands than usual in a special election, even though they still have that same short amount of time.”
Samantha Granville (COL ’17), another student who attended the trip, said that encouraging turnout during special elections can be problematic.
“Voter turnout is always the biggest challenge in elections. However, factoring in that this was a special election in an off year, each campaign has even a bigger challenge,” Granville wrote in an email to The Hoya. “With such a toxic campaign season in 2016, many people want to take a break from politics and have little to no interest in local politics.”
Hope also said students could witness the importance of races and campaigns beyond the presidential election.
“I’d argue that students should be paying attention to all elections, not just Presidential elections,” Hope wrote. “There are elections happening across the country all the time on a variety of levels, and they are all important. I’d encourage students to be constantly engaged, and not just in a Presidential Election year.”
Granville noted that the highlight of the trip was having a dynamic discussion and collaborating with a diverse group of students.
“My favorite part of the trip was spending time with my fellow Hoyas,” Granville wrote. “We all come from different backgrounds and have different political perspectives, but were able to discuss issues in a respectful manner to learn more about the current political scene and we challenged each other to defend our beliefs. It was proof that we can think differently about issues, but still maintain friendships to get work done.”

Reno Carlitti (MSB ’19) opted for a different spring break than many of his peers, spending part of his vacation founding a philanthropic project, Pizza 4 Others. The project aims to help feed people currently experiencing homelessness in Washington, D.C.
The independent organization Pizza 4 Others aims to deliver 38 pizzas every week for one year to people living in homelessness in D.C. The pizzas will be provided by Manny & Olga’s Pizza restaurant on Wisconsin Avenue, and distributed through the Father McKenna Food Center.
Carlitti said he thought of the initiative after hearing about a promotional offer at Manny & Olga’s.
“I heard about this deal with Manny & Olga’s, where if you buy 1,000 pizzas, they will give you 1,000 pizzas for free. I thought this was a great idea. I figured we could raise the money and then give the 2,000 pizzas away,” Carlitti said.
According to Carlitti, Pizza 4 Others, which is sponsored by the Zeta Psi fraternity, has been a collaborative effort among Georgetown students.
“Pizza 4 Others is a bunch of D.C. college students coming together to donate 2,000 pizzas to the hungry in D.C. over the next year,” Carlitti said.
Carlitti created a GoFundMe page to raise the $16,500 needed to finance his project. The project has raised $3,015 from 48 people since its launch March 23, mainly from students affiliated with social fraternity Zeta Psi.
Ned Hogan, director of development and volunteer coordinator at the Father McKenna Food Center, said Carlitti’s efforts to help feed the hungry have the capacity to make a real difference in homeless people’s lives.
“Reno Carlitti has created a unique partnership between a pizza restaurant and feeding the hungry,” Hogan said. “We applaud his efforts to help us to serve those who have so little. We definitely are rooting for him to succeed in this effort to mobilize the Georgetown community to support So Others May Eat and the Father McKenna Center.”
Andrew Ward (COL ’19), a member of Pizza 4 Others, said Carlitti’s determination propelled the initiative.
“Reno and I serve on executive board for the fraternity, and he brought this idea and we talk every week about philanthropy and nothing ever happens,” Ward said. “And then Reno came in and had this entire plan completely fleshed out immediately and was like it’s $16,000. Initially I laughed because I didn’t think it was possible, but then realized how much work and how much thought had gone into it and I decided that it was something I wanted to help with and try to accomplish.”
Carlitti said Zeta Psi’s sponsorship has been vital to the project.
“The International Zeta Psi Headquarters has given me so much help by giving me their network and providing ideas on how to get some publicity.” Carlitti said.
Reaching out to other student organizations is crucial to reaching their goal, according to Ward.
“With any sort of movement or drive, the more the merrier,” Ward said. “The more people you have, the easier it is to accomplish a goal. So at Georgetown, everyone has their own personal network, which is why I think it was critical to reach out to some groups on campus to see if they could blast through their listserv.”
Carlitti said Pizza 4 Others is an important initiative to create stronger ties between Georgetown students and the greater D.C. community.
“This would be a great step forward to say that the Georgetown community cares about its neighborhood, cares about the people of D.C., and is willing to help and come together and unify over this donation.”

On the 50th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Beyond Vietnam” speech, speakers called for a greater awareness of the university’s role in addressing racism in the United States in a series of events hosted by the Program on Justice and Peace and the Center for Social Justice.
Sponsored by the Office of the President’s Let Freedom Ring initiative and co-sponsored by the Office of the Provost and the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship, the daylong April 4 program featured speakers involved in organizing the civil rights movements of the 1960s and ’70s and today.
In afternoon presentations in the Healey Family Student Center and an evening panel in Lohrfink Auditorium, speakers centered on the imperative to depart from the evils of society King identified in his speech, including war and racism, to achieve social transformation.
André Keet, director of the Institute for Reconciliation and Social Justice at the University of the Free State in South Africa, said Georgetown is complicit in the “giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism and militarism.” In examining the relationship between student activism at U.S. universities and at South African universities, he said a goal for universities must be to diversify curricula.
“Higher education as an institution is complicit in producing the challenges we are facing today,” Keet said. “Scholars have identified a number of common themes across the globe. One: This generation of students is profoundly disillusioned with the democratic processes at play in our respective countries. Two: They are angry with neoliberalism’s capture of higher education and the consequences of fees and increasing inequality. And three: They are critical of the ways in which Eurocentric, white, middle-class culture is unquestionably the norm in universities.”
Keet said Georgetown’s implementation of the recommendations made by the Working Group on Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation will be telling of its commitment to social justice. University President John J. DeGioia established the working group in August 2015 in an effort to address the university’s benefit from the sale of 272 slaves to a Louisiana plantation in 1838.
DeGioia announced Sept. 1 the university would provide legacy status in the admissions process to descendants of the 272. The university will also rename Freedom and Remembrance Halls on April 18 as Isaac Hawkins Hall — after the first enslaved person named in records of the 1838 sale — and Anne Marie Becraft Hall — after a Catholic sister and educator in the Georgetown neighborhood during the 19th century.
In a discussion between civil rights activists and Black Lives Matter activists on historical lessons for activists today, panelists stressed the importance of grassroots organization in their communities.
“Two years from now will be the 400th anniversary of the first slaves brought to British North America, and for just as long there’s been resistance to those institutions and to the broader structures of white supremacy that define our society,” justice and peace studies and philosophy professor Mark Lance, one of the event organizers, said in an introduction of the panel.
Associate professor of history Marcia Chatelain moderated the discussion, which featured civil rights activists Mandy Carter, Sekou Mgobozi Abdullah Odinga and Gwendolyn Zoharah Simmons. The panelists spoke on the lessons they value from their experiences as lifelong organizers.
Carter, a black lesbian social justice activist and 2005 Nobel Peace Prize nominee, discouraged modern activists from misremembering civil rights activism and the messages in “Beyond Vietnam,” which included the struggle for economic justice.
“One of the things he was working on last before he got assassinated was called the ‘Poor People’s Campaign’,” Carter said. “That speech can be so relevant to where we are today. One of the points he’s making is that with all the struggles that went on about the right to sit at that lunch table, a question: When you got up there, did you have any money in your pocket to buy anything?”
Black Lives Matter activists Anthony Grimes, David Ragland, April Goggans and Rev. Osagyefo Uhuru Sekou offered advice to students interested in organizing in the ongoing struggle for social justice.
“Don’t shame each other and don’t have purity tests for who can do the work,” Sekou said. “Don’t shame. Don’t take yourself too seriously. Do your homework.”
The speakers encouraged Georgetown students to examine the institutions in which students are complicit. Goggans noted that being educated at Georgetown University is a privilege, and called for students to engage with the disparities the city of Washington, D.C., faces.
“In this city you have every intersection, every issue you can ever dream of,” Goggan said. “We’ve got to expand our understanding of what this moment demands from us. And how far are you really willing to go? Have you thought about how expansive your personal power is? That is the moment that we’re in.”

This is nuts.  Keet is a wacko.  Eurocentric, middle-class culture (and values) don’t dominate universities in America.  Liberals, globalists and the diversity crowd and identity mafia do.  
I like when he said this best:  “Georgetown is complicit in the “giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism and militarism.”
I like it because it’s a great reminder that people like liberal race scammers like Keet and the Black Lives Matter crowd are insane, paranoid, dramatic, and hate America, American institutions, and the American people in general, while hating White people in specific. 
Funny though that despite how much they us they still seek to immigrate here and don’t seek to go to countries in Africa (or Latin America or Asia or the Middle East) which are supposedly so much better.  
By the way, I saw no diversity on the panel.  Everyone is black.  Isn’t that racist?
