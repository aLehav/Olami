The Georgetown University Student Association Election Commission announced it would hold the results of Thursday’s referendum on replacing the senate with a new assembly early this morning, pending a review of alleged unconstitutionality at polling stations.
The Election Commission announced it would postpone the results in a tweet at 1:08 a.m. Friday after D.J. Angelini (MSB ’17), Mark Camilli (COL ’19), Charles Hajjar (MSB ’20), Dylan Hughes (COL ’19), Isaac Liu (COL ’20) and Jasmin Ouseph (SFS ’19) filed a complaint with the GUSA Constitutional Council alleging that polling locations hosted by GUSA may have attempted to influence votes in addition to electioneering.
GUSA Constitutional Council Justice Russell Wirth (COL ’19) said the council plans on holding a public hearing on the complaint. Wirth said the results will be held until the council adjudicates the matter.
Before the vote, The Hoya obtained an internal GUSA email sent to senators and executive members that encouraged supporters of GUSA restructuring to change their profile pictures to include an endorsement of the measure. Members of GUSA, including Senate Speaker Richie Mullaney (COL ’18), Chief of Staff Ari Goldstein (COL ’18) and Vice Speaker Cherie Vu (COL ’19), also led a social media campaign encouraging students to support the referendum.
Students campaigning against the referendum cited food offered at polling stations as bribes, an excessive amount of “‘yes” campaign posters on polling stations and the placement of certain polling stations outside the permitted tabling zones.
GUSA senators offered a pancake breakfast in Red Square and free Melties ice cream sandwiches for the first 100 students wearing stickers proving they voted. Funding for these and other get-out-the-vote efforts came from GUSA’s Sunny Days Fund, a fund set aside for GUSA to use at its discretion during the year.
GUSA spent a total of $602.18 consisting of $25 for the inflatable Jack the Bulldog, $99.99 for the pancake breakfast, $400 for Melties, $32.19 for “I voted” stickers and $45 for candy available at polling stations across campus, according to minutes from Tuesday’s Fin/App meeting obtained by The Hoya.
GUSA senators manned polling stations the day of the referendum located in Red Square, a hallway behind Sellinger Lounge in the Leavey Center, inside the HFSC and outside of Leo’s.
The university’s free speech and expression policy allows tabling only in designated areas, including public squares and certain locations outside of Lauinger Library, Henle Village, Darnall Hall and the Healey Family Student Center.
To be binding, the senate referendum needed to receive support from 25 percent of the student body, or approximately 1,683 votes.
GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said she hopes the results are released promptly, despite the Council decision.
“We hope that these results come out as soon as possible. We believe that the student body ought to know how they voted. To our knowledge they will not be released tonight due to an external group that has asked the Constitutional Council to hold these results.”
“Vote No on GUSA Restructuring Campaign,” an online, student-organized group against the assembly wrote in a statement released on the decision to delay results from the petitioners who submitted the complaint.
“Today, excessive ‘Vote Yes’ flyers and campaign materials were on display at nearly all GUSA polling stations. Individuals were given stickers that could be exchanged for free ice cream sandwiches at the very same polling stations that were encouraging them to vote “yes”. This was biased, this was indirect solicitation and this was unlawful campaigning,” the statement read.
Ouseph said the polling stations were biased in favor of the “Vote Yes” campaign, whose members posted campaign materials on the booths.
“Earlier today I was informed that the polling stations had ‘Vote Yes’ material all over it. I asked members of senate leadership if that was OK and they said because GUSA endorsed it that the GUSA polling stations were allowed to do that. They said polling stations were fine, but they have to remain unbiased so this either means no campaign materials at all or an equal mix of vote yes and vote no,” Ouseph said.
GUSA Senate Speaker Richie Mullaney (COL ’18) said he is confident the results will be released and certified soon.
“We’re very confident that all the actions taken by GUSA on referendum day were in compliance with the Constitution and the bylaws. We did not break any rules,” Mullaney said. “So we’re looking forward to the Constitutional Council’s ruling and we’re looking forward to the results of this referendum being released to the public.”
Students voted on two measures, a referendum on whether to make campus smoke-free and another on the plans to reform the senate, on Thursday. According to the GUSA bylaws, the council must release the results of both referenda by Sunday unless the Constitutional Council intervenes.
Angelini said he was disappointed with GUSA’s handling of the electoral process.
“The framing of the policy itself and the question made it inaccessible to the average voter, being that they would have to read the entirety of two separate constitutions to even understand the complex nature of the amendment,” Angelini said. “What I saw today in the process of establishing and managing polling places was truly the most disheartening to me.”
Student Activities Commission Commissioner Ricardo Mondolfi (SFS ’19), who is also GUSA’s liaison to student organizations and was involved in drafting the restructuring proposal, said he does not believe any money spent by GUSA was biased toward a particular campaign.
“I think there were also accusations that GUSA spent money on stuff that happened today and even if it was, it wasn’t on campaign things,” Mondolfi said. “The free stuff was provided to any student that voted regardless of how they voted.”
Mondolfi said he does not believe GUSA get out the vote efforts were unconstitutional.
“I do not think anything that happened today was unconstitutional,” Mondolfi said. “Most of the rules that exist regulate presidential campaigns because they have specific wording for candidates and today was a referendum. The same thing happened in 2006 because this is a  referendum and it does not include candidates; it is different.”

Correction: This article previously stated Ricardo Mondolfi (SFS ’19) was a GUSA Senator and SAC Chair; he is a SAC commissioner and GUSA’s liaison to student organizations.

Missing a key element here. The “they” I’m referring to when I say “[t]hey said polling stations were fine, but they have to remain unbiased…” was the Election Commission, not senate leadership.
“Earlier today I was informed that the polling stations had ‘Vote Yes’ material all over it. I asked members of senate leadership if that was OK and they said because GUSA endorsed it that the GUSA polling stations were allowed to do that. They said polling stations were fine, but they have to remain unbiased so this either means no campaign materials at all or an equal mix of vote yes and vote no,” Ouseph said.
[…] Council previously ruled against the GUSA Executive and senate leadership in December 2016 after students opposing a planned dissolution of the senate and restructuring of club funding filed complaints to the […]

The Georgetown University Student Association announced 49.64 percent of students voted “yes” in a referendum for a tobacco-free campus in results released Friday at 1:31 a.m.
According to the GUSA Election Commission, 46.37 percent of students voted against the referendum.
Thirty-four percent of students living off campus participated, 51 percent living in freshman south,  48 percent in freshman north, 45 percent in west campus, 39 percent in east campus, 45 percent in central campus, 46 percent in north campus, 21 percent abroad and 43 percent in south campus.
The referendum was nonbinding and will determine GUSA’s advocacy stance on the university’s plan to create a tobacco-free campus by the 2017-18 academic year.
The referendum began as a petition led by Mac Williams (NHS ’17) and GUSA Senator Henry Callander (COL ’18) on Oct. 4.
The Georgetown University Medical School campus implemented a full smoking ban in 2014. The Smoke Free Georgetown campaign aims to ban all tobacco products on campus.
Currently, smoking is prohibited in any indoor spaces, as per university regulations, and allowed only in designated outdoor areas, which must be 25 feet away from building entrances to reduce the risk of secondhand smoke.
The referendum results were intended to determine how GUSA would advocate to the university on how to become a smoke-free campus.
GUSA Senate Speaker Richie Mullaney (COL ’18) said GUSA will take the narrow margin of the vote into account.
“GUSA’s going to take a nuanced stance and a nuanced perspective on this and make sure that any changes the university makes are not done without student input. Obviously smoking is an issue on campus that needs to be addressed, but it needs to be addressed delicately,” Mullaney said.
GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’18) said the result shows the role GUSA must play when discussing policy changes with the university administration.
“We need to work with the university to ensure that any necessary measures they are not currently taking into account leading up to a smoke-free campus are put in place,” Khan said.
The Smoke Free Georgetown campaign argued that a smoke-free campus would clear the air of secondhand smoke for everyone on campus, including non-smokers.
Opponents argued that the ban would infringe students’ civil liberties and would be practically unenforceable. Some students argued that smokers, particularly international and exchange students, could be marginalized and isolated by a sweeping tobacco ban.
“Vote NO to the Smoking Ban” Campaign Leader Saad Bashir (SFS ’19), who is also a former GUSA senator, said the campaign aimed to find a compromise.
“The purpose of the ‘No’ campaign isn’t to keep the status quo but engage in a conversation that can find some effective middle ground, a policy that solves the problem without attacking smokers,” Bashir said.

The legal age to purchase tobacco products will increase from 18 to 21 after Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) signed the Prohibition Against Selling Tobacco Products to Individuals Under 21 Amendment Act on Nov. 29.
The legislation, initially introduced in 2015 by Councilmembers Kenyan McDuffie (D-Ward 5), Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3), Elissa Silverman (I-At Large), Anita Bonds (D-At Large) and Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), along with former Councilmember Vincent Orange (D-At Large), prohibits the sale of tobacco to anyone under 21.
Bowser also signed a bill Nov. 18 banning the use of electronic cigarettes inside public establishments including bars, restaurants and workplaces and another bill Nov. 29 prohibiting smoking and smokeless tobacco from sporting events.
The bills must now submit to a 30-day congressional review period in accordance with the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973. Unless they are rejected by a joint resolution in Congress, the bills will take effect next year.
According to a D.C. Committee on Health and Human Services Report presented by Councilmember Yvette Alexander (D-Ward 7), who serves as the committee’s chair, the bill aims to combat nicotine addiction in the District, which suffers from some of the highest rates of tobacco use among high schoolers in the nation.
Nearly 12.5 percent of D.C. high schoolers smoke cigarettes, making the District fourth out of 44 reporting states in high school tobacco usage. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention found in 2015 that 35 percent of District high schoolers have used electronic cigarettes at least once and 13 percent use them regularly.
The bill nevertheless encountered opposition from Councilmembers David Grosso (I-At Large), Phil Mendelson (D-Ward 4) and Anita Bonds (D-At Large), who all voted against the legislation.
Grosso’s Communication Director Matt Nocella said although the councilmember supported the public health goals of discouraging tobacco use, Grosso worried this legislation would increase youth encounters with the justice system and exacerbate the school-to-prison pipeline.
“Surely there must be a better way to curb youth tobacco use than to rely on our police force to stop our young people and issue citations,” Nocella wrote in an email to The Hoya. “[Grosso] believes we must work to educate our youth on the harms of smoking and put the onus on those who sell or distribute tobacco products to young people.”
Henry Callander (COL ’18), who helped spearhead the campaign for a smoke-free campus that was put to a vote in yesterday’s Georgetown University Student Association referendum, said the new age for purchasing tobacco could drastically cut nicotine addiction in the District considering 90 percent of all tobacco users start before the age of 21.
“I think that limiting that age to 21 would significantly affect all college students and all people of that age group in a positive way,” Callander said.
Callander also emphasized the disparity in the harm caused by tobacco use and alcohol consumption. The consumption of alcohol was already legally restrained to those 21 or older despite causing fewer annual deaths than tobacco. The World Health Organization currently estimates 6 million people globally die from tobacco use each year, compared to 2.5 million from alcohol-related harm.
“Tobacco use is more harmful or, at least, on the same level as alcohol,” Callander said. “So the fact that you have to be 21 to get tobacco now, I think it makes sense completely.”

A petition calling for the university to guarantee the rights and safety of students without documentation and “oppressed and targeted communities” has amassed about 600 student signatures as of Wednesday.
In light of President-elect Donald Trump’s victory three weeks ago, a group of students without documentation and their allies formed the GU Sanctuary Movement, which launched the petition on Nov. 23. The online petition, addressed to University President John J. DeGioia, lists 22 demands to the university and the Georgetown University Police Department.
The letter asks for the university to refuse to cooperate with the Immigrant Customs Enforcement and Department of Homeland Security, as well as make its recently appointed part-time undocumented student coordinator into a full-time administrator.
The petition also demands that the university designate an all-gender bathroom in each building, institute cultural competency training for all Counseling and Psychiatric Services staff, increase the budget for the Academic Resource Center’s service of first-generation students, establish a course in American Sign Language and support mandatory teach-ins for professors on how to respond to racism in the classroom.
“We, the undersigned members of the Georgetown community, write to encourage you to take the necessary steps for Georgetown to become a sanctuary by making a commitment to the human rights, safety, and dignity of every Georgetown student and employee, as well as their families,” the letter reads.
Members of the Georgetown Sanctuary Campus Movement will march from Red Square to DeGioias’s office to deliver the letter today at 2:30 p.m.
The petition comes after DeGioia sent a campuswide email Nov. 29 affirming the university’s support for students without documentation within the limits of the law.
“I wish to encourage each of us to recommit ourselves to supporting one another — to working together to do all that we can to ensure that our community is a place of deep care for each person, especially those who feel most vulnerable,” DeGioia wrote. “In this moment, we remain dedicated to harnessing the resources of our university to pursue and promote the common good.”
DeGioia signed a statement in support of President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program on Nov. 21.
Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh said DeGioia will continue to work with members of the student population to meet their needs.
“In recent weeks, senior leaders including President DeGioia have met with members of our community about a range of concerns related to our undocumented students,” Pugh wrote in an e-mail to The Hoya. “All of our students, faculty, and staff are deeply valued members of this community and we will continue to explore how we can best support and care for all members of our community.”
The GU Sanctuary Movement said university employees and groups have supported some of the ideas for the measures outlined in the petition.
“The administration has been very responsive,” the GU Sanctuary Movement wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “We’ve been working with them and GUSA throughout the process, including members of the Undocumented Students Task Force, CAPS staff and GUPD officers. A lot of the measures are already in progress to some extent, and we’re looking forward to working with the administration on carrying out the rest of them.”
The petition is based on a suggestion by the immigrant rights organization Cosecha Movement’s website as part of an effort to encourage universities to declare themselves sanctuary campuses.
Reed College, Columbia University and Portland State University in Oregon are among a number of universities that have declared themselves sanctuary campuses since the presidential election results.
Alexis Larios (COL ’18), co-chair of Chicano advocacy group MEChA de Georgetown and a supporter of the petition, said the letter works to build on some of the steps the university has taken in regard to immigrants.
The Hoya reported Nov. 23  that the university appointed Arelis Palacios, currently serving as senior associate director of programming and advising for the Office of Global Education, as a part-time coordinator for undocumented students.
“We recently had a petition to hire an undocumented student coordinator to help with legal issues and financial aid,” Larios said. “The letter includes things like making that from a part-time position to a full-time position. We are building on the work we’ve already done.”
According to Larios, Georgetown needs to take the lead in supporting undocumented students to be an example for other educational institutions around the country.
“Our university has taken a lot of steps so far in the right direction in terms of voicing support for marginalized students,” Larios said. “At University of San Francisco, their president went on CNN and said, ‘Yes, we are becoming a sanctuary.’ For us not to do that would be a huge question mark.”
Larios said the petition was a call for Georgetown to continue in its mission to educate all students regardless of their identities.
“It’s making sure that if our country can’t provide resources, our universities can do everything to make sure their students succeed, which is what education in universities is about,” Larios said.

Georgetown will perform a $27.5 million, five-year overhaul of the university’s entire Wi-Fi infrastructure starting this January in partnership with Verizon Communications, according to Vice President for University Information Services and Chief Information Officer Judd Nicholson.
The university and Verizon will begin the three-year project this January, starting with the buildings with the oldest Wi-Fi infrastructure, including the Rafik B. Hariri Building, the Intercultural Center and the Preclinical Science Building on the Medical Center campus.
Nicholson said the deal will enable Georgetown to introduce cutting-edge technologies.
“What Verizon has also proposed is not just an uplifting of the infrastructure and improving the Wi-Fi connectivity but also a partnership that will allow Georgetown to benefit from new and emerging technologies,” Nicholson said. “We can benefit and really learn from all the innovation and technology that is really going on.”
Nicholson said the new technologies brought by Verizon could help analyze student traffic patterns on campus and alleviate congestion issues.
“Those are things we can bring to campus — maybe looking at traffic patterns and how students move in and out of buildings and looking at ways to improve the student experience,” Nicholson said.
Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh said the new partnership would fix existing Wi-Fi issues on campus and allow the university to fully take advantage of modern innovations in technology.
“This strategic partnership will not only address the critical need to replace aging infrastructure but will also provide the foundation for future innovation. The timing is both necessary and presents an opportunity to leverage modern, emergent technologies in a holistic campus wide manner,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Nicholson said he does not anticipate any disruptive construction work to occur with the infrastructure overhaul other than some minor digging to upgrade underground fiber-optic cables.
Verizon Enterprise Solutions Director of Corporate Communications Kevin King said Verizon is eager to work with the university in implementing an infrastructure overhaul plan that will make Georgetown a leader in innovation in education.
“Verizon is excited to partner with Georgetown University on its multi-year technology upgrade plan,” King wrote in an email to the The Hoya. “Judd Nicholson and his team have an aggressive plan focused on sustainability, safety and innovation that will directly benefit the students, and put Georgetown at the forefront of educational technology.”
The Hoya reported Sept. 16 that the university was planning a Wi-Fi overhaul, with four companies — AT&T Inc., Verizon Communications, CenturyLink and Windstream — vying for the contract.
Talks to address various problems surrounding the university’s Wi-Fi infrastructure began in 2014, according to Nicholson.
The Student Technology Advisory Board, consisting of students, staff and faculty addressing technology issues on campus, chose Verizon during the fall of 2015. Over the past year, UIS and Verizon have negotiated the terms of the contract. UIS has not publically announced Verizon’s receiving the contract.
“We pulled together a group of stakeholders to look at all of those proposals,” Nicholson said. “Over a year we have gone through to structure a contract that is really representative of a relationship between Verizon and Georgetown, and it is not just transactional but a true partnership with a premier technology provider.”
According to Nicholson, Verizon was chosen to complete the overhaul because of the similar goals it shares with the university on uses of technology to promote sustainability and the opportunity it provides for the university to use cutting-edge developments in technology.
“It aligned with some of our long-term technology strategies so our engagement with the city, with the District on Smart Cities, the ability to leverage emerging and future technologies as well as where our values are aligned on sustainability,” Nicholson said.
According to Nicholson, the Wi-Fi in all buildings on campus will be fully upgraded to provide a consistent internet experience.
“Many of our buildings have infrastructure that is so old that it can’t take advantage of the new software in optimizing performance so we are going to focus on the oldest buildings and upgrading that Wi-Fi and we will work our way through every building across all the campus at Georgetown,” Nicholson said.
Verizon’s partnership with Georgetown will also develop goals in line with the current White House Smart Cities Initiative, which aims to use technology to reduce poverty, traffic congestion, crime and other societal issues.
Nicholson said in three years, the partnership with Verizon will also revamp the university’s cybersecurity measures. Verizon will also provide the university with cybersecurity advice and guidance.
The Hoya reported April 8 that a university Wi-Fi outage March 31 was the result of a cyber attack.
“We are going to be able to leverage Verizon’s expertise in what is called a security operations center,” Nicholson said. “We will get the advantage of any new technology they may introduce to mitigate things like denial of service or to mitigate hacking issues.”
STAB Chair Yafet Negash (COL ’19) said the board supports the new partnership and its goals of creating a robust technology infrastructure for the future.
“On the new network initiative, STAB’s main contribution was to highlight the current infrastructure’s shortcomings from the student body’s perspective,” Negash wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are pleased that the University has finally recognized the importance of a secure, reliable, and robust network solution, and excited that it has invested accordingly.”

On Nov. 19, James Pavur (SFS ’16) was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to pursue a Ph.D. in cybersecurity at Oxford University starting next year.
Pavur, a science, technology and international affairs major, was one of 32 American students out of 882 applicants nationwide to receive the scholarship this year, which had a 3.6 percent acceptance rate. Pavur is the 25th student in Georgetown’s history to receive the award, joining the ranks of Georgetown alumnus President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68).
Hannah Rhodes (COL ’15) received Georgetown’s first Rhodes Scholarship since 2011 last year.
An avid student of computer science, Pavur, serves as the director of information security for Students of Georgetown, Inc. He has also competed and won awards at numerous hackathon competitions where he worked to develop an interface that allows paralyzed or injured people to type, among other projects.
Pavur also mentors Georgetown Women Coders, an organization that supports female science, technology, engineering and math education
Pavur plans to graduate from Georgetown this fall.
As an ultimate goal, Pavur aims to serve within the U.S. Department of State’s Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues and hopes to alter the United States’ approach to the cybersecurity landscape of the future.
In an interview with The Hoya, Pavur discussed his achievement, his commitment to public service and his future in the world of cybersecurity.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Can you describe your first emotion upon hearing about your Rhodes Scholarship acceptance?
I was really surprised that I was the one who ended up winning. There was a whole room full of really incredible people who got invited down there from a bunch of schools and I know there were great candidates from Georgetown, too. And it was just very surprising to me. I very much thought that I had lost the competition after my interview.
You’ve said that one of your goals is to work for the U.S. Department of State’s Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues. Why do you think you would want to devote yourself to that particular office and issue area?
Cybersecurity right now is a very militarized area. It exists mostly in the context of the intelligence communities of the world and law enforcement communities of the world. And I think that it’s going to become a more and more important component of our diplomatic strategy and not just in a, ‘we have to extradite criminals or we have stop people from hacking us from abroad.’ But also, I think there are a lot of countries who share similar concerns about organized crime or terrorism in cyberspace and there’s a lot of opportunities for cooperation on cyber issues. I’d really love to kind of work on seeing how the United States can work with our allies and even people who aren’t quite allies but might become them in cyberspace more closely.
To follow that, as you have said that your ambition is to work in the federal government, what does public service mean to you?
The reason that working for the federal government and being a public servant is so appealing is because the sort of work that you do does have a tangible impact on the lives of millions of people. I could work for a startup, and maybe create some really cool product, make a lot of money and then kind of run off to a mansion, but there’s so many tough challenges that need to be solved in the public service space and I think that’s where our future is going to be determined over the next century, in cyberspace, and it would be great to play a part in that.
Rhodes Scholars are chosen, at least partially, on the basis of achieving great things for humankind throughout their lifetimes. Do you feel ready for all of the years ahead?
No. Achieving great things is a really, really high bar. There’s a lot of work to be done in cyberspace. I think that there are a lot of great things that will be achieved, and I’ll definitely give it my best shot, but just to be able to play a small part in that would be incredible.
Do you have a favorite book, what is it and why?
I would give a very, very strong vote for any of the books in the Narnia series as a favorite. They’re a lot of fun to read. They kind of follow each other quickly. If I had to choose a favorite book from the Narnia series, it would probably be The Silver Chair, which I think is the sixth book in the series. And, I just really like — there’s a character in that, that is always very gloomy, very cynical, very depressing and I love him, his name is Puddleglum, I think — best character in literature. And that’s not the high War and Peace answer you might expect, but C.S. Lewis is great at writing.
Do you have a hero? 
Maybe Puddleglum.
I don’t know. There are a lot of really inspiring people in my field and in the area that I’m interested in and I hope to kind of achieve a lot of what they have achieved. I think that my hero is kind of a nameless person who’s been working within the intelligence community, and who has been working within cybersecurity for the past 10 years, 20 years and doing some of the really groundbreaking work that I’ve kind of been exposed to peripherally, but isn’t public information. I think that there are some incredible people who have been leading the way and hopefully I’ll get to meet them in my experience.
What is something that most people wouldn’t guess about you?
I really like tea. As a hobby, I like collecting tea, ordering it from abroad. When the tea catalogues come out, it’s like Christmas for me. There are all kinds of specific tea suppliers, I get excited about what country the tea will come from, years the tea was harvested in. It’s like anything, if you kind of get into it enough, there’s this whole world that kind of opens and people are kind of obsessed over it. Tea is kind of my thing.
The big thing for me has been kind of focusing on things I like to do. When I was a freshman, I was very much, ‘I have to do everything, I have to commit to a bunch of different things.’ And, it’s very hard to do something halfway, and it’s extremely hard to do something halfway and do it well. And I think that focusing in on your core interests as early as you find them and not being hesitant about pursuing it would be the advice I’d give me.  I wish I had started coding more aggressively the moment I came to Georgetown. There’s such a great community of people here who know programming and they’re not as visible as maybe at some tech schools, but they’re there and I wish I had gotten them earlier.
If you knew the whole world was listening, what would you say?
That’s a tough one. The future’s exciting, and I think that we should dive in headfirst into it, but we should be a little careful about it. I think cybersecurity isn’t just about fighting hackers or spying on communications, it’s really about taking all of this magical, incredible stuff, all the [interview] cameras that are recording me right now, all of the lights in this room, the connections that allowed me to apply for the Rhodes Scholarship online. There’s just so many, basically magical things around us, and I think cybersecurity is about letting us enjoy that magic safely.

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) expressed her support Tuesday for a bill to make it harder for non-D.C. residents to use the city’s homeless shelter system.
The bill follows the release of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress on Nov. 17, which detailed a 14 percent spike in homelessness in the District over the past year, tied with Idaho for the largest percentage increase of states nationwide.
At the mayor’s monthly breakfast with the D.C. Council on Tuesday, she urged the passage of a bill introduced in September that would tighten the paperwork requirements for the homeless to verify that they are D.C. residents as well as disqualify those with access to safe housing options from emergency shelters.
Only California and Washington state surpassed D.C. in terms of the largest raw number increase of homeless people since last year. The District’s homeless population increased by 1,052 people since last year, compared with California’s 2,400 person increase and Washington’s 1,400 person increase.
D.C. Coalition for the Homeless Executive Director Michael L. Ferrell attributed the increase to the rising cost of housing in the District, specifically for the larger homes that tend to be more suitable for families.
“There’s no one simple solution to the problem of homelessness, but certainly what our leaders can focus more on is creating more housing opportunities in general for low-income people, not just persons who are experiencing homelessness, but low-income citizens as a whole,” Ferrell said.
Ferrell also predicted that unless the D.C. government increases low-income housing or offers housing voucher programs, wherein the District would help fund low-income residents’ housing, the number of local homeless residents could continue to rise.
Bowser additionally cited the risk of overflowing shelters once temperatures drop below freezing as a reason to act on the legislation. According to the D.C. Department of Human Services, the District spends $80,000 every night on motel rooms for homeless families. During the winter months, the DHS lists 12 percent of those families as non-D.C. residents.
A coalition of six homeless advocacy organizations wrote a letter to the D.C. Council urging it not to act until a full hearing is held.
The Homeless Assessment Report highlighted that fewer than 5 percent of D.C.’s homeless population was unsheltered during the night in January. The District enforces a right-to-shelter law, which guarantees homeless individuals and families shelter during hypothermia season between Nov. 1 and March 31 when temperatures fall below freezing temperatures.
HUD measures data for the report each year by picking one night in late January during which researchers assess the homeless population within certain localities and use those estimates to make nationwide projections. HUD found a total of 8,350 homeless people living in the District on Jan. 28.
Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 3) said homelessness in the District contributes to a wider range of issues and added that there may be solutions the D.C. Council can work toward in attempting to lower homelessness rates.
“Ending homelessness in D.C. requires that we provide ample human services and job training, access to emergency shelter and affordable housing,” Evans wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Ferrell added that he would like to see a greater awareness of the prevalence of homelessness in the District among area residents.
“Homelessness can affect anyone,” Ferrell said. “Most people are only one, two or three checks away from being homeless themselves, so people should realize that by and large it’s an economic issue above all else, so it really can happen to anyone.”
Georgetown University Homeless Outreach Programs and Education member Mandy Brouillard (NHS ’18) echoed that one of the most important steps policymakers can take in combating homelessness is garnering public attention to the issue.
“It doesn’t get the same amount of attention as other social issues and individuals experiencing homelessness in general don’t get a lot of publicity in the media,” Brouillard said.
Brouillard emphasized the homeless community in D.C. is plagued with complex issues of mental illness and violence, which need to be addressed along with economic factors.
“They face a number of disadvantages and civil rights abuses,” Brouillard said. “What’s important is recognizing that it is a problem and getting the public on board with that is important.”

The Georgetown University Medical Center and the Georgetown University Law Center launched the Health Justice Alliance, an educational and training partnership, to increase access to medical care and legal services for low-income Washington, D.C. residents on Nov. 22.
The alliance joins students from the two schools, as well as faculty, clinicians and other health professionals, to establish classes and train future professionals to identify and treat health-harming legal challenges.
The medical-legal partnership will place law students at Georgetown health clinics to provide free legal services to low-income patients on site.
GUMC announced that the first class for both medical students and law students will launch this spring, and the following fall the program will begin embedding law students at health clinics.
Georgetown University Health Justice Alliance Medical Director Eileen Moore explained that her goal of creating a medical-legal partnership developed when she was treating an asthmatic patient whose condition worsened due to her living conditions. Moore said she sought the help of an attorney to help the patient access safer housing.
“We have the resources here, the human resources, individuals who are passionate about health justice and social justice,” Moore said. “As soon as you look at taking care of patients, particularly patients in vulnerable populations, it becomes abundantly clear that a lot of the health-harming social determinants of health cannot be mitigated by physicians alone. We need the strength of the team the interdisciplinary team, to be able to intervene in many situations.”
Moore highlighted the partnership as a reflection of the university’s Jesuit tradition and commitment to social justice.
“It’s going to be incredibly exciting and I think very empowering to be able to practice at this new, deeper level to really be able to not only delve into those social determinants of health but also to have the toolbox there to help mitigate those problems,” Moore said. “I think that’s going to be incredibly powerful.”
GULC professor Yael Cannon said the program will seek to address racial inequality in the District as well as economic inequality.
“People who are living in poverty in Washington, D.C., especially people of color who experience significant health disparities, experience legal barriers to good health,” Cannon said. “We’re trying to mobilize the resources of both of our institutions together to try to address those barriers so that people can get healthy and experience true justice.”
According to a report released early September by the School of Nursing and Health Studies’ Department of Health Systems Administration, black men are expected to die 15 years earlier than white men in Washington, D.C.
Center for Law and Social Policy Director of Income and Work Supporters Elizabeth Lower-Basch said this kind of partnership can provide quality health care while still taking a complete look at other challenges a patient might face.
“Medical-legal partnerships are a promising way to help low-income patients address their non-medical needs, such as adequate food or safe housing, that have a large influence on their health,” Lower-Basch wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The Center for Law and Social Policy is pleased to see Georgetown undertaking this effort and incorporating a holistic approach to supporting patients and families in the training of future lawyers and doctors.”
Kelly Singleton (LAW ’17) said she was happy to hear about the creation of the partnership and predicted that the program could give GULC and GUMC students practical career experience while still allowing them to participating in social justice.
“The new initiative will not just serve our community, but expose Georgetown law and med students to real-world issues we don’t read about in casebooks or learn in lectures. I encourage all students to learn more about the program and participate if they can,” Singleton wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It’s yet another reason to be proud to be part of the Georgetown community.”
Stephanie Goldberg (LAW ’19) also expressed excitement about the opportunity to work personally with residents in the District.
“The Georgetown University Health Alliance is an exciting new opportunity for students to both further their personal academic interests in careers surrounding health and the law as well as gain unique hands-on experience which will directly connect the students with the local community,” Goldberg wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This program greatly reflects the university’s commitment to social good, opportunity for all, and justice, while providing students with top-notch, new and innovative learning offerings.”

Five undergraduates have declared an African American studies major in the program’s first semester, according to African American studies Program Director Robert J. Patterson.
The students are juniors and seniors.
Another 20 students have declared a minor during the course of the semester. The minor was originally introduced in 2005.
The major launched this fall. A minor program has been a part of the College since 2003, offering a series of elective courses.
Students majoring in African American studies must complete 10 courses, including “Introduction to African American Studies,” “Methodologies and Theoretical Issues in African American Studies” and seven elective courses in the department.
Sierra Cribb (COL ’18), who declared the major this semester, said she was interested in learning more about her own identity.
“I realized that my interests as an African-American woman were starting to align with learning more about what it means to be an African-American woman and what that looks like in a place like Georgetown, a predominantly white space,” Cribb said.
University President John J. DeGioia announced the creation of an African American studies department and major Feb. 4 as part of a series of commitments to address racial injustice at Georgetown. African American studies had previously been an interdisciplinary program since 2003.
Patterson highlighted the importance of the African American studies department at Georgetown.
“There is recognition of the importance of African American studies as an academic discipline, being on the forefront of interdisciplinary knowledge production,” Patterson said. “Thinking about the history, the cultural and economic factors that have led to racial stratification is one example, but as important to the ways that black cultural production has been critical to advancing this conversation.”
Last September, the African American studies program and the Provost’s Committee on Diversity created a petition to establish the major. Twelve sections of the “Introduction to African American Studies” course have been offered over the past seven years and have been overenrolled three times, according the university website.
Though Patterson said Georgetown has lagged behind other institutions of similar prestige in fostering scholarly engagement with African-American history, society and culture, he said he considers the creation of the major to be a sign of progress.
“The earliest ethnic studies program was born in the late ’60s,” Patterson said. “Georgetown got its African American studies program in 2003. So that gives you a sense of where it is on the trajectory.”
Patterson noted Georgetown’s significant progress toward greater racial justice over the past decade.
“Even at this later entrance, Georgetown is making the strides to commit the resources to develop the African American studies department into a first-class institution comparable to the institutions that have had it for 30, 40 years as well,” Patterson said.
Georgetown College Dean Chester Gillis said the university’s decision to confront its own history with slavery heightened the need for the academic program. DeGioia announced a series of efforts Sept. 1 to address Georgetown’s profiting from the sale of 272 slaves to a Louisiana plantation in 1838, including offering descendants of the 272 slaves legacy status in admissions.
“The work on this major began before the university initiative on Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation, but now takes on increased importance in light of this groundbreaking work at the university level inspired by President DeGioia,” Gillis wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Gillis said while he cannot completely gauge the popularity of the major at the moment, students’ excitement suggests a positive future for the program.
“Students have demonstrated interest in this major,” Gillis wrote. “How that interest translates into students electing to take the major remains to be seen, but I am optimistic that there will be a critical mass.”
Patterson said multiple freshmen are on track to declare the major in their sophomore years.
“There are a lot of first-year students who we’ve met and worked out a planning sheet; first-year students can’t declare the major yet, but they are on the path to declare in their sophomore year,” Patterson said.
Both Patterson and Gillis said the focus of the department right now is to hire more professors to increase class offerings and attract more students.
“We are hiring new professors for this department, which will increase the class offerings and this should also drive traffic to the major,” Gillis wrote.
Though he did not rule out the possibility of modifying the curriculum in the future, Patterson said the department is not yet at the stage of being able to accurately evaluate the program.
“We haven’t even completed a semester with it. We know that, going forward, we will modify the curriculum to ensure that the department is providing a greater number of courses,” Patterson said. “That’s a consequence of our expanding the faculty.”
Patterson said the program looks to shift the focus of historical and cultural analysis away from traditional, Euro-centric study to analysis focused exclusively on African-American studies.
“It decenters the European ideas and values as being the norm — the aspirational values as well,” Patterson said. “We’re interested in training students in the methodologies of African-American studies, in the epistemologies of AfricanAmerican studies, and not to become docile subjects but to become active innovations and interrogators of the future of the world they live in.”
Cribb also said she hopes to see current freshmen advance their interest in the program to the point of declaring a major or a minor.
“I hope their interest right now will develop into a pursuit of a major or minor or further studies, because I think that Georgetown and Dr. Patterson and the department and the faculty and staff are working diligently to develop something really great,” Cribb said. “I hope people take advantage of it.”

The Georgetown University Student Association senate voted unanimously Monday evening to pass a resolution expressing solidarity with the Ohio State University following a car and knife attack that injured 11 students Monday.
The resolution also called on the university to increase awareness of the university’s public safety efforts and for students to take advantage of university self-defense courses.
“Countless members of the Georgetown University community have been affected by the events that occurred at the Ohio State University,” the resolution reads. “The Georgetown University Student Association Senate stands in solidarity with the Ohio State University community in offering its condolences and support to those affected in this senseless attack.”
The resolution said universities are responsible for protecting their communities from the threat of violence.
“Georgetown University and other institutions of higher learning have committed themselves to creating safe environments for academic exploration,” the resolution reads. “Incidents of violence on college campuses represent a clear and distinct threat to all students at institutions of higher learning.”
The resolution encouraged the university administration and the Georgetown University Police Department “to spread awareness of the safety plans set in place to maintain the security of the student body.”
GUPD Chief of Police Jay Gruber said he is supportive of the senate’s resolution and that the university has extensive plans for active shooter and attack situations.
“We continually plan and exercise for these types of situations and work very closely with MPD on response elements,” Gruber said. “We have been following the Ohio State incident very closely, and, at this time, we don’t have any plans to change how we would handle a similar event.”
GUSA Senate Speaker Richie Mullaney (COL ’18) said the resolution was an expression of support and a call to action.
“We wanted to send our condolences and support to Ohio State students as well as promote training programs like ‘run, hide, fight’ to raise awareness of what to do in case of an emergency at Georgetown,” Mullaney said.
GUSA Senator Ben Baldwin (SFS ’19), who introduced the resolution, said he was personally affected by the violent incident at OSU.
“Having gone to public school in Ohio, I know a countless number of people that attend OSU, one of whom is my older brother,” Baldwin wrote in an email to The Hoya. “He was only three buildings away from the location of the attack and was forced to remain locked down in his classroom until the all clear signal was given.”
The attacker, an OSU student named Abdul Razak Ali Artan, struck victims with his car before jumping out and continuing the attack with a knife. Artan was later shot and killed by OSU police officer Alan Horujko after failing to obey orders.
Baldwin said the bill would send a message of support in line with Jesuit values.
“I offered this resolution as a sign of support and solidarity to another campus, out of my own personal attachment to the situation and the knowledge that countless Hoyas, too, were affected by the events of the 28th,” Baldwin said. “I think it sends a strong message of being men and women for others when our student government is able to act and extend a hand of support when another campus is faced with an unimaginable threat.”

Georgetown University Transportation Services plans to pilot more frequent Saturday services for spring 2017, pending final approval Dec. 6.
A joint effort with Georgetown University Student Association, the spring pilot service would implement a more frequent Saturday service to Dupont Circle from noon to 7 p.m., running in 20-minute intervals.
The Dupont route will also stop at the Trader Joe’s on M Street.
A second Saturday shuttle will also run every 15 minutes and transport students to Safeway on Wisconsin Avenue from noon to 3 p.m.
The GUTS pilot program will be funded by reallocating $36,000 currently dedicated to a late-night shuttle from Adams Morgan that runs between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m. on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. This service is being cancelled due to the lack of ridership in the Adams Morgan service.
It is estimated that only 50 students per week use the Adams Morgan shuttle over its three days of service. Currently, GUTS offers a weekend shuttle on Saturdays to Dupont Circle that runs every 80 minutes and another shuttle to Rosslyn that also runs every 80 minutes.
Planning and Facilities Management Vice President Robin Morey said the GUTS pilot program would improve access to the District on weekends for students.
“The objective is to provide greater connectivity on weekends within the existing resource level,” Morey said. “The goals are to provide improved services. Success will be demonstrated by increased ridership and client feedback.”
The GUSA Master Planning Committee proposed expanded weekend services after the 2016 survey on transportation indicated that 86 percent of undergraduate students expressed interest in extended weekend bus services.
According to GUSA Master Planning Chair Zac Schroepfer (MSB ’19), expanded weekend shuttle services will ensure access to the District for students from all socioeconomic backgrounds.
“Georgetown proclaims itself to be a university that’s in the capital, at the heart of the nation’s capital. But unfortunately, as many students know, it’s very hard to access the actual city of Washington, D.C.,” Schroepfer said. “We’re really aiming to bridge that divide and shrink any socioeconomic gap by allowing all students to have the same access to the benefits of Washington, D.C.”
Schroepfer said the pilot program also aims to improve food accessibility for students.
“We’re also looking to increase food accessibility, ensuring that students have easy access to both Safeway and Trader Joe’s, which are both pretty accessible and affordable options for students to be able to access food that they can then cook for themselves on campus,” Schroepfer said.
GUSA Chief of Staff Ari Goldstein (SFS ’18) said the current GUTS weekend service proved inadequate compared to the ease of other methods of transportation.
“A couple years ago they added what they’re calling weekend service, but it’s really, really inadequate. It’s just on Saturdays, it’s just during the academic year and there is one bus with a wait time of 80 minutes, which is ridiculous,” Goldstein said. “It makes more sense to Uber or take a city bus and we’ve heard from a lot of students that that’s a pain, that it’s a socioeconomic inclusivity issue.”
The weekend pilot service joins GUSA’s other initiatives to improve on campus transportation for students.
The success of Turkey Shuttles, which were GUTS shuttles to Reagan National and Dulles airports for students flying home for Thanksgiving, led Office of Transportation and Management to introduce a Holiday Shuttle program for the end of the semester. The program will provide free transportation to and from Reagan and Dulles at peak travel times for winter break.
According to Schroepfer, GUSA is looking to expand weekend transportation options beyond the GUTS weekend pilot service and is currently in conversation with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority to provide students with discounted weekend passes on the Metro’s bus and Metro services. The passes would be incorporated into student tuition.
Schroepfer, who will serve as one of GUSA’s representatives in its discussions with the WMATA Board of Directors, said he was optimistic about the Metro project.
“While this pass is in its fledgling state, we are excited to see where further cooperation with WMATA and the District government can take us,” Schroepfer said.
Goldstein said the expanded GUTS weekend service would set a precedent for future long-term solutions.
“If the spring pilot is successful and we see that a lot of students are riding the pilot for spring, then it’ll be very clear proof to the Office of Transportation Management and to the board that this is something to be funded long term,” Goldstein said.

Georgetown professors expressed concerns over federal funding for environmental research with the incoming President-elect Donald Trump’s administration.
Trump made multiple comments disputing climate change during his campaign. His selection of Myron Ebell, who denies climate change, to lead his transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency has also raised concerns.
Environmental advocacy group Students for Climate Security led a march against Ebell’s leading the transition team from Red Square to Ebell’s office on L Street on Nov. 18.
Throughout his campaign, Trump has blamed China for making up the theory of climate change as a hoax and pushed to save the coal industry.
Biology professor Gina Wimp’s research on the genetic and environmental factors that affect biodiversity depends heavily on federal funding. Wimp said she is concerned about her funding in light of Trump’s campaign messages.
“Honestly, I feel uncertainty because I really don’t know what Trump is going to do. I feel that I can’t really get a read on it,” Wimp said. “But, the indication I have so far is that he doesn’t seem to really value a lot of scientific research.”
Wimp said if federal funding were to be curtailed, she would not be able to cover the costs of her research. Even with the help of private grants and resources procured by the university, she would have to cut essential aspects of her research.
“That would basically take away my ability to use any sort of molecular analysis in my research, so it would really limit the scope of my research,” Wimp said. “I would have to simply work with things that I can financially afford.”
Biology professor Edward Barrows, who previously served as director of the university’s Center for the Environment, said federal funding for scientific research has been in decline for several years already. Barrows said he is concerned that the incoming administration will further reduce already limited resources.
“Funding is already very limited, and the new administration could make it even more limited,” Barrows wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This would affect that research effort at GU and elsewhere. From the standpoint of GU science students, there could be fewer resources for their research projects. This is worrisome in this era of science and technology.”
Georgetown University Medical Center’s Dean of Research Robert Clarke said cuts in federal funding have already hurt researchers in the past and that future cuts could have negative repercussions.
“Cuts in federal funding for research hurt all of us by slowing and even stalling critical research,” Clarke said. “We have serious issues right now with an aging Baby Boomer population that will experience the silver tsunami of disorders including Alzheimer’s and cancer. We can’t afford to go backwards.”
School of Foreign Service Science, Technology and International Affairs Program Director Mark Giordano said that while Georgetown supports scholars by covering relatively low-cost expenses, it cannot provide higher-end items for research.
“Georgetown in general and the School of Foreign Service in particular has many programs to help support faculty with smaller budget items such as travel and conferences. There is no way it can support the big-ticket items,” Giordano said.
Clarke said some of Georgetown’s funding initiatives are designed to help scholars obtain the federal resources necessary for professors to complete their projects.
“At the medical center, we have a number of community philanthropists called ‘Partners in Research’ who provide seed funding for the exploration of early scientific ideas,” Clarke wrote in an email to The Hoya. “These are critical dollars for researchers to generate data that then helps to apply for larger grants.”
Associate Vice President of Federal Relations Scott Fleming said despite the likelihood of Trump’s administration cutting research funding, the role of multiple government branches and departments in the budget process makes the final outcome unclear.
“President-elect Trump and his team will put together a budget proposal for 2018, and we will once again begin the annual appropriations process,” Fleming said. “When it comes to this budget process, there are a lot of people involved, it is not simply the administration.”
Fleming said the 21st Century Cures Act, which was passed by the House of Representatives yesterday, provides a mechanism for continued funding in the area of health care that is independent from the fiscal budget. The act will fund public health programs, new cancer treatments and new treatments to combat the opioid epidemic.
“It is a broadly supported bill. And it would, this money would be there and it would be in this separate account,” Fleming said. “Given the fact that it’s set up in this way and it’s already paid for. It is, to an extent, isolated from the overall budget, because the money is there for that and nothing else.”
Fleming said the university will continue working to ensure that funding reaches scholars in Georgetown no matter the budget.
“With proposals for increases in defense spending and for tax cuts, it is hard to see how the budget is going to play out over the next couple of years,” Fleming said. “I am by nature an optimist, but I am also a realist, so I see the challenges that lie ahead.”
Giordano said while predictions may not be optimistic, it is best to exercise caution when considering the future of research funding under the Trump administration.
“While the signs for research funding are not good, you have to think carefully about predictions,” Giordano said. “The country doesn’t always get what it voted for and sometimes that is good.”

The university should increase discussions on race and identity to create a more inclusive campus for minority students, according to students who participated in the Hoya Identity Town Hall on Wednesday.
The town hall, co-sponsored by the Georgetown University Student Association, Black Leadership Forum, Latinx Leadership Forum, the Division of Student Affairs and the Office of the Provost, provided a space for engagement and discussion about nationally pressing issues following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory. About four more town halls will be scheduled for the spring semester.
Black House Resident Director Shola Powell (COL ’17), who is also a member of the Black Leadership Forum, said the town hall is the first in what she hopes will be an ongoing series of discussions on identity.
“Earlier in the semester, we were talking about how there are not enough spaces on campus to talk between staff, faculty and students about what they experience that influences their day-to-day living, and we came up with the idea of a town hall series, and each year we would change the identity we focused on,” Powell said. “This year, it was going to be race.”
The recommendations from each town hall event, which all took place in the Healey Family Student Center, will be presented to University President John J. DeGioia, according to Powell.
Powell said the focus of this first town hall shifted slightly after Trump won the election.
“After election night, the campus was very sad and quiet. There was a visible toll and response to how distraught people were about the future with a President Trump,” Powell said.
Sociology professor Michael Dyson, who spoke at the town hall, said students should engage in activism following the election.
“The first thing you can do as serious activists is go to class. Know what you are talking about. The classroom is an engaged space of enlightenment, exchange of ideas and contestation of worldviews,” Dyson said. “You have to be deeply and profoundly ensconced in a tradition of enlightenment, where people are grappling with ideas.”
Dyson said the most important initiative going forward on campus is bridging the gap between theory and action.
“The distance between theory and practice means you’ve got to try to apply that stuff right at the center at a place like Georgetown,” Dyson said. “What I love about what you all do here at Georgetown is to make certain that we are trying to involve ourselves in the very processes that we think are intellectually defensible.”
Organizers passed around microphones for an open discussion to attendees seated at about a dozen tables after Dyson’s talk.
Nada Eldaief (SFS ’18), who attended the panel, said a professor’s remark during a class after the election made her uncomfortable in a class. Eldaief did not disclose the class.
“We were talking about the election in a class and one of my professors turned to one of the students, who is a black Muslim female, and said, ‘I don’t understand your people’s fear.’ I was very taken aback by that and a little bit hurt,” Eldaief said. “Obviously political beliefs differ, and that is what makes Georgetown so special, but no one is asking you to understand someone else’s fear.”
LGBTQ Resource Center Assistant Director Julian Haas, who is also member of the Bias Reporting Team, said students should report any instances of harassment and bigotry to university personnel through the bias reporting system.
“Regardless of how you feel about the system, this institution can and will respond when things are reported, so please, please use that system, whether it’s about a peer, faculty, or staff member, or someone unaffiliated with the university,” Haas said. “If you don’t submit them, we do not have official record of what happens.”
GUSA Chief of Staff Ari Goldstein (COL ’18), who attended the town hall, said the event reaffirmed his commitment to engage in uncomfortable discussions and learn how to help marginalized groups on campus.
“The way we’ve been addressing issues of diversity and inclusion is inviting people to feel a personal connection to it, which in some ways is really effective. However, I think it has papered over some nuances in the experiences of different marginalized groups on campus,” Goldstein said. “My epiphany this semester has been that students of color and black students particularly experience marginalization in such a deep way that I will never be able to understand.”
GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said platforms for dialogue like the identity town hall are essential given that Georgetown, although largely accepting and inclusive, has faced an uptick in bias-related incidents after the election. Two bias-related attacks against students were reported in the week following Trump’s victory.
“Institutionally, the university has been very mindful of the election and its impact and have been willing to work with the students, meet with them and discuss,” Khan said. “However, when you look at what is happening day to day, with microaggressions, that’s where I think the focus needs to be.”
According to Goldstein, there needs to be a balance between achieving the maximum community engagement and not trivializing nuances between different privileges or claiming superficial knowledge of someone else’s struggle.
“When we talk about creating a culture on campus truly inclusive of the black community, that has to be so much more than just being able to ‘think about diversity’ and ‘respect differences.’ It is about actually changing structures and tackling the issues head-on,” Goldstein said.
Kumail Aslam (COL ’17), who spoke during the discussion section, added that effective allyship is a two-way street.
“The Muslim community needs allies, but we also need to be allies to other people,” Aslam said. “This is a time where we are very scared and this is a lot of fear in our communities, but I think if we work together, we can definitely fight back against that.”
