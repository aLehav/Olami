In 1962, Richard H. McCooey (C ’52) established two properties on 36th Street, with the aim of giving back to his beloved university. His brainchildren — The Tombs, 1789, and later, F. Scott’s — would prove to have an outsized, indelible effect on Georgetown.
McCooey died Aug. 6 in Greenwich, Conn., at the age of 83, from complications stemming from cancer and cardiac arrest.
McCooey lived nearly his entire adult life in Georgetown, moving to Greenwich following a stroke nine months ago.
McCooey was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1930, to a politically entrenched family. At Georgetown, he served as president of the Yard, the forerunner to the Georgetown University Student Association, before graduating with degrees in history and government.
“There were some things he was just really personally very committed to; number one, he loved the university, and the reason he built 1789 and The Tombs was he wanted to give something back to the university,” Clyde’s Restaurant Group CEO and Co-Owner John Laytham said.
Laytham attended the School of Foreign Service from 1962 to 1964, bearing witness to the profound change to campus social life that accompanied the foundation of the The Tombs, which moved revelry closer to campus, from M Street.
“It was just a wonderful place to go to, and you didn’t have to go to another place far away,” he said. “There was always an extremely interesting mix of teachers and students, and today you’ll see all kinds of people in The Tombs.”
McCooey sold his trio of properties in 1985 for $3 million, entrusting the management to Clyde’s Restaurant Group, with whose leadership he had a longstanding relationship. He founded restaurant design company Persona Studios the following year, and would continue to design and consult for his former restaurants, as well as others in the Clyde’s portfolio, along with his wife Karen, whom he married in 1990.
1789 and The Tombs, which share a renovated federal-style house that had previously hosted two businesses, have evolved to provide a fine-dining experience catered to the elite and a casual service and bar catered to the university, respectively. The early years saw a different atmosphere — the bulletin board guarding the staircase to The Tombs formerly served as a take-out window to the now posh 1789.
McCooey had participated in the Air Force ROTC program while at Georgetown, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force. He gave up a career in advertising for the chance to manage the properties on 36th and Prospect. His dedication was described in a 1968 feature on McCooey in The Hoya: “Mr. McCooey eats and sleeps 1789. He eats his meals there, and he sleeps in a room outside his office, and he had better, since he draws no salary. To put it simply, McCooey is so totally dedicated to Georgetown, making his own contribution in his own inimitable way, that most anyone would call him a fool. … But after all, it takes a fool, careless of his own welfare, to accomplish the things for which everyone is eventually grateful.”
The decor of each of McCooey’s properties was of utmost importance to their respective characters, from the upscale, classic 1789 to the rowing-themed Tombs.
McCooey complemented his aesthetic genius with a sense for atmosphere. In 1964, he established the enduring tradition of Chimes Nights, inspired by the Whiffenpoofs’ weekly performances at Yale local establishment Morey’s.
“I’m not sure there’s any Chime that doesn’t know how important Richard was to the group and how much he meant to all of us who knew him well and for what he did for the group for many years after we graduated,” said John Broughan (CAS ’64), the president of the a cappella group at the time. “Everyone feels he’s as much of a Chime as any one of us is. He actually came to our reunions, he would come to the reunions. For all intents and purposes, he was one of us, and always will be.”
Broughan and McCooey were introduced by a mutual friend, and then worked to develop an arrangement that would capture both the spirit of the Georgetown Chimes and McCooey’s restaurants. The initial concerts were held on Friday afternoons in the upstairs pub of 1789; they soon moved downstairs to The Tombs on Wednesday nights — a shift that would raise the profile of both the group and the restaurant, which were highlighted in The Washington Post.
“The relationship and bonding became so strong that any time Richard had VIP guests in the dining room, he would quickly call us to sing, people like the Speaker of the House,” Broughan said. “Inevitably, after the restaurant would close, we would just sit and talk with him.”
The terms of the 1985 sale included a guaranteed table at his old properties, and McCooey would often frequent Chimes Nights, forming relationships with multiple generations. Broughan had organized a group of Chimes alumni from the New England area to sing to him in Greenwich that was scheduled for the day he died.
In 1966, McCooey received the John Carroll Award, dedicated to alumni who best exemplify the ideals of the university and its founder.
“Dick was an extraordinary man and he will be greatly missed as a dear friend to many members of our community. We are deeply grateful for his longstanding dedication to Georgetown and for all he did to establish both The Tombs and 1789 as such special, meaningful places for our students, alumni and friends,” University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) said in a statement to The Hoya.
Chimes alumnus Kevin O’Brien (CAS ’65) said that McCooey’s contributions to the university are unparalleled.
“I would tell him that he did more for Georgetown than the 1984 National Championship. He would smile and say, ‘I never quite got over my days on campus.’ He was truly a phenomenally kind, generous man, perhaps the most important Hoya of all,” he wrote in an email. “Is there room at Healy Circle for another statue?”
McCooey is survived by his wife. A memorial service will be held at Holy Trinity Church in Georgetown on Sept. 5. Perhaps the best summary of McCooey comes from his own words, in a 2009 video for the university’s Witness to History project.
“We opened in 1962 and I discovered I wasn’t really the best person to run things. I could think them up, could idealize. It was the same back when I was president; I could become president of the student body, but I perhaps wasn’t the best president. But I ran those places for some 20-odd years … and it was unique in the sense that there was nothing else like it,” he said. “And although lots of people wanted me to do it in their universities and things like that, I was just dedicated to Georgetown. I just wanted to do it for Georgetown.”

A sad day.  He was a great supporter of all things Georgetown.  Back in the 70s when the student paper was short of cash he was always there with a 1/2 page ad to get us over the hump. The same could be said for countless other student organizations who needed a  booster.  He changed Georgetown for the better with his happy and almost recklessly unselfish spirit. Go Hoyas, Go Dick McCooey. RIP

If the Chimes or Holy Trinity needed food for a fundraiser or picnic –  he was there no charge. A Man for Others. Rest in Peace. And thank you.

When I asked my wife Beatriz C ’79  to marry me it was naturally at the ’89. When Mr McCooey was tipped off about my proposal by the hostess he sent us champagne  20 years later our daughter Binky C ‘ 07  WAS the hostess. He ACHIEVED what he set out to do. A special place for generations of Hoyas!   Ken Rynne C ‘ 78 L’83

After 13 years at the helm, University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) has reached a milestone. The Georgetown fixture is now the longest-serving president in the university’s history, surpassing the 12- and 13-year tenures of former presidents Fr. Leo O’Donovan, S.J., and Fr. Timothy Healy, S.J.
But DeGioia says the real significance of the 2014-2015 academic year is not entering his 14th year in office, but the anniversary of his time as part of the Georgetown community. Forty years ago, Dean of Admissions Charles Deacon sent 18-year-old Jack his acceptance letter.
“I’ve been a part of this place, now, this will be the 40th year,” DeGioia said. “To this day I feel very blessed that I was invited into this community and given the opportunity to do the work I’ve been able to do here.”
DeGioia was named Georgetown’s 48th president in July 2001, after a career as a philosophy professor and senior administrator on campus. After graduating from Georgetown with a degree in English in 1979, he became a hall director in New South and has since served as an assistant to the president during Healy’s presidency, dean of student affairs, and senior vice president during O’Donovan’s time in the president’s office, negotiating the deal that sold the university’s hospital to MedStar while retaining its School of Medicine. He earned a doctorate in philosophy from the university in 1995.
“I’ve been in this office 13 years, and sometimes I still feel like it’s their office,” DeGioia said of his predecessors.
DeGioia is the first layperson to lead Georgetown, following 47 priests — mostly Jesuits — in the role.
For O’Donovan, Georgetown being led by a layman relates to the Second Vatican Council’s recognition of the importance of laypeople to the Catholic Church.
“I see the fact that Jack was elected president as a layman not only as reflective of his great quality, but also as the impetus of the council,” O’Donovan said.
“I think I would not have been able to serve long if I hadn’t been able to find ways for us to be the most authentically Catholic and Jesuit,” DeGioia said.
For much of Georgetown’s history, the lengths of its presidents’ tenures were limited by the position’s Jesuit link. The university president simultaneously served as rector of the Jesuit community, a position that one person can only hold for six years, until the two roles were separated in the 1960s.
Since then, university presidents have served around a decade. DeGioia began as president at 44 — a younger age than most of his predecessors.
“He acquired the experience and understanding of the university and its values at an early age and became president at a relatively early age, so it’s not surprising he has a career marked by longevity,” said Paul Tagliabue (CAS ’62), president of Georgetown’s board of directors.
“I was a little younger when I started. That was a little unusual,” DeGioia added. “I sort of joke, the old Indiana Jones line, ‘It ain’t the years, it’s the mileage.’ I’ve got some mileage on me.”
When DeGioia entered the president’s office in 2001, he was confronted with the university’s serious financial concerns and infrastructure needs. The first few years of his term were devoted to building new residence halls and academic construction, the university’s fundraising campaign and its commitments to faculty salary growth and need-blind financial aid, DeGioia said.
Since the mid-2000s, DeGioia has been able to focus on less immediate needs, including strengthening Georgetown’s global presence, involving extensive travel, launching the McCourt School of Public Policy and examining long-term approaches to academics.
“It’s almost been like two jobs for me,” DeGioia said. “The job I did from ’01 to ’05 and the job I’ve done since ’05.”
Now, DeGioia said, he thinks of Georgetown in terms of five elements: academic excellence, its home in Washington, its international character, its Catholic and Jesuit identity and its community.
Over the next year, DeGioia said, he’s looking forward to the university’s Designing the Future(s) programs, continuing to launch the McCourt School of Public Policy and finishing the Healey Family Student Center.
Beyond that, DeGioia said he will stay in his second-floor Healy Hall office “as long as it makes sense.”
“When I was a child, my dad was in the air force for a company that moved us a lot, and by the time I was 11, I had lived in 11 different places in three different states,” DeGioia said. “People often say, ‘How’d you stay at Georgetown all this time?’ If you’d moved 11 times by the time you were 11 years old, you might want to stay put for a while. But I know what it’s like to move, and when the day comes, if it makes sense, I’ll be ready to move.”

The 2010 Campus Plan agreement to increase student common space and living space, various construction projects across campus have posed a problem for administrators and students attempting to navigate road closures and excessive noise.
As the fall semester begins, six major projects are underway. According to Vice President of Planning and Management Robin Morey, these projects mark the last major campus construction efforts for the foreseeable future.
“From a community commitment perspective, this should fulfill the requirements posed in the Campus Plan,” Morey said.
Morey emphasized that the intentions behind the construction projects are for the good of the student body in their aim to create more common space on campus, and that the administration welcomes student input.
“[Vice President for Student Affairs Todd] Olson and our team really worked with the students, GUSA, to reflect increased student engagement, designing it to what the students want,” Morey said.
He acknowledged that the obstructions posed by the construction would be bothersome in the short-term but hoped students would keep in mind the long-term benefits of the various projects.
“I understand construction is painful,” Morey said. “But when you think about the students and the community, this is improving Georgetown for the future. With this construction, we’re improving accessibility, bringing more students on campus and providing more common space.”
The Healey Family Student Center, located on the first floor of the New South residence hall, and accessible from Prospect Street, is set to open Sept. 5. The center, which will add 43,000 square feet of student space, is expected to have study rooms and meeting rooms, in addition to a central great room, pub staffed with food from Bon Appétit management, and Hilltoss, a new Students of Georgetown, Inc. storefront, set to open Nov. 1.
“The inside is almost complete,” Morey said. “The stonework and rails will go in soon.”
The Center for Student Engagement took occupancy of the site on Aug. 18, and has hired a director for the center, Patrick Ledesma.
“I hope and foresee that this building would be the center of student social life and student casual, social interaction,” Center for Student Engagement Director Erika Cohen Derr said. “What I think everyone hopes for this building — all the students and alumni who put the time into envisioning what we need on this campus — is a space that supports student life in all of its aspects.”
In addition to the expansive interior, the student center also will feature a patio filled with grass and trees overlooking the Potomac, an idea Morey credited to student contribution. To obtain LEED certification for green building practices, the center also includes a rain garden at the corner of Prospect Street.
Morey acknowledged that, during construction, students living above the work area in New South had filed numerous noise complaints, but said that the noise pollution was unavoidable.
“It’s worth the pain,” he said.
While building the center, steps were taken to increase accessibility and pedestrian efficiency, Morey said. Instead of the steep Library Walk, students can now enter through a ramp on the bottom floor of the HFSC and take an elevator to the top of the hill next to New South. Additionally, traffic on Prospect Street will be restricted to allow only outgoing vehicles, and the guardhouse will be moved to the end of the street near Lauinger Library, easing congestion along the street and near O’Donovan Hall to promote pedestrian access.
Renovations on the former Jesuit residence in Dahlgren Quad are underway to prepare new housing space for students living on campus. As a component of the 2013 agreement to avoid the institution of a satellite campus, the abandoned Ryan and Mulledy Halls are being converted into suite-style residences. They are expected to be ready for the next school year in fall 2015.
“There will be 148 beds housed here with lots of common space,” Morey said.
Ryan Hall will have suites that Morey expected would primarily be for seniors, featuring eight individual rooms around a common space that will include a kitchen. Mulledy Hall will feature semi-suites with two people to a room sharing a common bathroom, similar to the current arrangement in Copley Hall.
The entrance to the two buildings will be located across from Village A on Library Walk, and the area in front will be landscaped to feature green space.
Because of asbestos concerns, Morey said that everything inside would be brand new.
“The whole building was completely gutted and is being remodeled,” he said.
Construction over the summer also drew complaints about noise at odd hours of the day.
“Every morning, at approximately 6:30 a.m., I was promptly awoken by the construction work taking place behind Healy Hall,” Joy Jackson (SFS ’17), who lived in Village A over the summer, said. “The construction work did make traversing campus way more difficult. There was always random equipment lying around, and there were cars, trucks, and other vehicles that partially blocked Library Walk.”
Noise will be a factor again with all the construction projects, with the brunt affecting administrative offices in Gervase and Maguire Halls, but Morey does not anticipate as many complaints with this project as with the HFSC, as the gutting of the inside is complete.
Construction on the Northeast Triangle project, located across from Reiss Building on the right side of the walkway from the Intercultural Center to Henle Village, will start at the beginning of the fall semester. The building will feature semi-suites geared toward sophomores, with completion expected by fall 2016.
Starting Monday, Aug. 25, Leavey Bridge will be closed, as will the walkway between Reiss and the future Northeast Triangle. The road between the ICC and Regents will also be shut off, which will limit access to Leavey Garage near the west entrance by the hotel.
“Construction companies will need [the road] for trucks and laydowns,” Morey said. “It’s a very tight space for construction.”
To mitigate pedestrian concerns during the construction, pathways designated by fences on both sides of the road have been created for walking, and a gate near the second-floor entrance to Regents will be open to allow students to cross the street. Signs will also direct students to newly opened entrances to Leavey located directly below Vital Vittles.
The John R. Thompson Jr. Intercollegiate Athletics Center will break ground next to McDonough Arena on Sept. 12. The $62 million facility will house state-of-the-art facilities for all 29 varsity programs, including practice courts for men’s and women’s basketball, locker rooms for men’s and women’s soccer and lacrosse, weight training facilities and a study lounge for athletes. Former Georgetown basketball star Patrick Ewing (CAS ’85) donated $3.3 million toward the construction of the facility in honor of former Georgetown basketball coach John Thompson Jr.
With construction slated to start in September, the two-year project is expected to be completed in the summer of 2016. As a result of the construction, pedestrian traffic will be redirected to the sidewalks by Wolfington Hall and Southwest Quad and the outdoor tennis courts will be removed.
The increased building capacity on campus requires additional capacity to be added to what Morey described as “the campus’s A/C unit.”
Located near the observatory, the expanded heating and cooling plant will permit full service of the entire campus. Morey estimated that, though essential, this construction project would have a minimal disturbing effect on campus life.
Returning to campus across the Key Bridge, students might have noticed a huge sheet across the face of the Car Barn. Morey explained that the Car Barn is not owned by Georgetown, merely leased. The actual owners of the building are in the process of renovating the parts of the building not rented by Georgetown, such as the parking spaces.
Although construction will not commence in the near future on this project, Morey also disclosed plans for a bus turnaround where all the Georgetown University Transportation System buses will converge next to McDonough Arena, with completion expected in October 2015.

The full lineup of The Corp’s inaugural music and arts festival was announced Monday, setting the stage for co-headliners The Knocks and MisterWives.
Kickback will open Sept. 1 with The Unforgiven, a cover band well-known in the Georgetown area, followed by two student artists — Peter Fanone and Tigers Are Bad For Horses — and three professional acts. COIN will open the professional set, with The Knocks closing out the night.
With Kickback, Students of Georgetown Inc. aims to welcome back students with a daylong schedule of activities, from 11:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. that allows for student prerogative.
“You can just spend all day in the actual venue, totally free to move in and out,” Corp CEO Sam Rodman (MSB ’15) said. “We’re billing it as a music and arts festival, but we want to make sure it’s a little more broad than that.”
To that end, the organizers — The Corp and Welcome Week — have designed an insular event, replete with games, food vendors and activities. The event has amassed external and internal sponsors (including The Hoya) to cover different aspects of the event. GU Art Aficionados will provide an installation of giant coffee cups attendees can spray paint, while Zipcar will loan a car on which attendees can draw. Several food trucks, including Surfside, will cater the event, while City Sports will sell Kickback-themed apparel.
“Welcome Week is under CSE, meaning we have access to benefits while The Corp does not, so much of my involvement has been around logistics like reserving space for the event,” Welcome Week Coordinator Sari Frankel (COL ’15) said.
The $10 ticket fee guarantees admission, free handouts, food items and drinks, which will be provided by long-term Corp partner Coca Cola.
Copley Lawn will be barricaded, with a controlled entrance by the Healy Gates. The cutout in front of White-Gravenor Hall will host a 20-by-24-foot stage.
The eclectic lineup aims to appeal to a wide array of the student body. Student acts, which are unpaid, were chosen based on a desire to achieve musical diversity.
Peter Fanone (COL ’15) has put together a full band, self-described as “indie-influenced alternative rock” for his first live performance in front of a large audience.
“I have been working on recording stuff for the past six years or so … and I finally wanted to try it live,” he said. “I just wanted to get some more experience working with professional groups and with fellow musicians to make a great sound and try something I’ve never done before.”
Mary Ellen Funke (SFS ’15), formerly of Mellenfolly and Mellen, will perform with Lyell Roeder (COL ’13), as part of new project Tigers Are Bad For Horses.
“We’re experimenting with more electronic sounds but there are also hints of jazz piano, and I’ll be singing, so it’s a mixture of genres that’s pretty new for me but also exciting. We’ve only been collaborating officially since this May so it’s all a bit of an experiment as we’ll try to find our style,” Funke, who first heard of the event through her involvement in The Corp, wrote in an email.
Giant’s Causeway, another student group, was originally set to perform, but pulled out after a band member broke a foot.
Each student act will perform a 25-minute set, while the professional artists will play for 45 minutes to an hour.
“We’re excited to play at Georgetown. Every time we play a show in D.C., it’s a blast,” The Knocks wrote in a statement through The Artists Organization representative Matt Robin. “[There is] something in the water down there that makes kids want to dance.”
The organizers have found the university and neighboring community to be supportive, and aim to establish a tradition for years to come.
Ticketing is open online, in Red Square and near O’Donovan Hall. Prices go up to $12 on Saturday and will retail for $15 on the day of the event. The event has a cap of 4,000 people.
“We’re definitely not looking to make a profit, it’s not really in the spirit of the event. If we do, we’ll come up with some sort of philanthropic scholarship,” Rodman said.

Days before the start of the fall semester, the university cancelled a study abroad program to Ghana for seven students in the School of Nursing and Health Studies following concerns over the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.
The semester-long program in Ghana, terminated on Aug. 19, was one of the options offered to international health majors as a part of their required study abroad during the fall of senior year. Other study-abroad options in Africa included trips to Rwanda and Tanzania.
The university issued a travel moratorium for Georgetown-sponsored activities in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone in an Aug. 1 email to the Georgetown community, a day following the postponement of a Coca Cola-sponsored African Business Forum, which was to have featured Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in Gaston Hall.
“This means that university funds will not be used to support trips to these areas, nor will the university facilitate or otherwise endorse travel to these areas until further notice,” Associate Vice President for Risk Management Joseph Yohe and Assistant Vice President for Student Health James C. Welsh wrote in the email.
There have been no reported cases of Ebola in Ghana as of Aug. 21. However, while it is outside of the moratorium zone, Ghana’s location in West Africa still puts it near the epicenter of the crisis.
“Due to the current outbreak of Ebola virus in West Africa, the university decided to suspend the Ghana program for the fall semester,” Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This decision came from a careful and measured assessment of the evolving situation in the region.”
Director of Global Education Craig Rinker declined to comment.
In a separate email, sent to the seven students who were to go on the trip, Executive Dean of School of Medicine Howard J. Federoff and NHS Interim Dean Patricia Cloonan confirmed the study abroad program’s cancellation.
“We realize this is very disappointing, but please know the decision was made — first and foremost — out of concern for your health and well-being,” they wrote in a joint email to the students.
Bernhard Liese, the chair of the international health department, said that the trip’s cancellation was not ideal for students.
“While we know this has been difficult, the university made its decision with the students’ well-being as the central factor. We deeply appreciate our students’ flexibility,” Liese wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The department presented the students with two alternative options: spend fall semester in Washington, D.C., to complete the spring semester’s internship early and then spend spring semester abroad, or forgo the opportunity to study abroad in favor of spending fall semester taking classes and working on a thesis, completing the spring internship with the rest of the class. The former option, which would still take place in Ghana, will be modified so students do not miss senior week and commencement, with a contingency plan in case the Ebola crisis continues into next year.
According to Medecins Sans Frontieres President Joanne Liu, the Ebola crisis could very likely continue into second semester. She predicted that the Ebola crisis would last at least six months.
“In terms of timeline, we’re not talking in terms of weeks, we’re talking in terms of months. We need a commitment for months, at least I would say six months, and I’m being, I would say, very optimistic,” Liu said to BBC News this month.
Of the seven who originally planned to go to Ghana, four students chose to pursue study abroad in the spring semester and three chose to complete theses.
The department also worked with the Office of Student Affairs to arrange fall semester housing for students who needed it.
Aishling Thurow (NHS ’15), one of the students who had planned to go to Ghana this fall, initially selected the program due to the high-quality work done on the program.
“By the end of it, you’ve completely done your own primary field research experiment and have a lengthy report to show for it,” she said. “To be able to graduate and say that you had that experience and were able to do that is definitely pretty impressive.”
Thurow expressed her concern that by forgoing the opportunity to study abroad in Ghana, her job chances post-graduation could be negatively affected.
“That’s honestly what made the decision so hard. If you decide not to go in the spring, you’re giving up this opportunity to intern and conduct primary research,” Thurow said. “Most careers and people already in the field value abroad experience a lot — more than anything.”
Thurow chose to do both a thesis and internship this semester, which will allow her to graduate early.
“I decided [to not study abroad] because I had the opportunity to graduate early and take what I was supposed to take in the spring now and write a thesis in place of going abroad,” she said.
Liese hopes that the alternative plans set up by the department will minimize the impact on students.
“We have worked very hard to minimize its impact and ensure that the students are positioned for success upon graduation,” Liese wrote.
In spite of the trip’s cancellation, Thurow remained optimistic about the coming year for the NHS students.
“It was very easy to be angry and frustrated and upset but there’s no use in that after a while and you’ve just got to focus on what you can do to make it right and make it the best year possible,” she said.

In accordance with the new minimum wage hikes, student employees at Georgetown will see up pay increases this year of up to $1.25, possibly at the expense of number of student jobs offered.
As of July 1, 2014, the minimum wage in Washington D.C. has been increased from $8.25 to $9.50, the first increase in a series of incremental wage increases until the minimum wage reaches $11.50 in 2016.
Cawley Career Education Center Executive Director Mike Schaub said that while student employment at the Career Center will not be affected by this first wage increase to $9.50, as the minimum wage rises further, the center might need to consider making budget cuts in order to absorb the financial loss.
“For 2015 and 2016, we will need to closely evaluate our budget to determine how many students and how many hours we can support. If our budget does not change, we may need to hire one less student (nothing drastic) or give students fewer hours to account for the wage increase,” Schaub wrote in an email.
Professor of Research at Georgetown University Medical Center Kathleen Pirollo agreed that the laboratory assistant job her office offers, which paid $9.25 prior to the wage increase, would not be affected significantly by this summer’s wage increase, but that the future increases could pose problems.
“It’s going to affect us more down the line as we proceed with hiring students during the year who are putting in more hours and who are maybe at a higher skill level, and also I think it’s going to affect us more down the line when the higher salaries kick in,” she said.
Pirollo noted that in addition to the budget cuts that would have to be made in order to compensate for the rise in minimum wage, the higher rate would raise the wage standard for employees with more work experience than the average college student.
“But now $11 is going to be at the novice level, how much is he going to expect us to pay for someone who has a little experience? We’re going to have to be paying them $13, $15 an hour? We don’t have that money to give them to do that, so we probably will wind up hiring fewer students because that’s the budget that we have,” she said.
She added that she felt that the minimum wage increase made less sense for part-time student employees.
“I think paying them like $11 an hour is not appropriate. I just think that it is not necessary for students who are working part-time to actually get paid that level, quite frankly,” Pirollo said. “I think that if you are an adult — you are a full-time employee of a company — that’s a totally different situation that needs to be considered by the company.”
Rather than cutting back on student employees, Lauinger Library plans to absorb the loss by filling most of their staff with students who are receiving work-study funding.
“The library expects to maintain its existing levels of student assistant staffing. To absorb the impact of the minimum wage increase, we will hire students who have work-study funding,” Lauinger’s Coordinator of Communications, Outreach and Programming Jennifer Ann Smith wrote in an email.
Casey Nolan (COL ’17), a student employee at the Lauinger Circulation Desk, said that while she was excited to hear about the minimum wage increase, she acknowledged that there should be a distinction made between student workers and full-time employees in terms of wage increases.
“If the supervisor is making $11.50 an hour and the students are too, I don’t think that’s fair, because the supervisor is a full-time employee. And some of my supervisors have a specific skill set,” she said.
However, as a work-study blind organization where the majority of members are not on work-study, Students of Georgetown Inc. has raised prices by three percent to account for the wage increase.
“In fact, we don’t actually know whether someone’s on work-study or not until they are already hired into the Corp,” Corp CEO Sam Rodman (MSB ’15) said.
In order to make up for the loss generated by the wage increase, The Corp would have to make $70 more an hour, which, under its current business model, would amount to a loss of $200,000 each year by 2016.
According to Rodman, cutting back staff would not be an option, since the same number of shifts would still need to be filled.
“If we cut a person, we would actually probably lose money on that shift because people wouldn’t get their drinks as quickly; customers would be more annoyed,” he said.
The 3-percent rise in prices will help compensate not only for the minimum wage increase but also for the increase in prices from their vendors, who are also raising prices in reaction to the minimum wage hike.
Rodman said that while students may not be thrilled about the price rise, The Corp remains a low-price option for college students.
“I think that people don’t love to see an extra nickel on their coffee. I think they’ll kind of understand it, and at the same time, when you look at how … prices are changing across D.C., number one, we’re certainly on the low end in terms of percent increase, and number two, we are still priced well below our competitors on everything,” he said. “That didn’t change.”

This past summer saw the entrance of new deans for the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Continuing Studies, as well as changes in the administration of the School of Nursing and Health Studies and the School of Foreign Service.
Norberto Grzywacz, who currently serves as professor of biomedical engineering at the University of Southern California, will take over for Bill Rebeck as dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Rebeck had served as interim dean following the retirement of Gerald Mara in June 2013.
Grzywacz said he was interested in Georgetown because of its focus on adapting to the need for universities to serve as more than another source of delivering information, following the spread of Internet access.
“President [John J.] DeGioia and Provost [Robert] Groves … are paving the ground for a revolution in higher education centered at Georgetown University,” he wrote in an email. “This revolution will be based on the three pillars of the university, namely education, research and attention to the common good.”
In line with this goal, Grzywacz pointed to interdisciplinary programs as the central focus of his plan for the school.
“One of the goals of the university in years to come is to increase the size of its graduate student body. This growth will be in large part because of the creation of new interdisciplinary masters and Ph.D. programs. In my conception, these programs will focus on problems of high societal value rather than just emphasizing the tools of a discipline,” he wrote in an email.
In the course of his transition to assuming the role of dean in January, Grzywacz will visit Georgetown for the graduate student picnic in September and an executive committee meeting in October and confer with Rebeck. Grzywacz plans to continue his research and teach at the university at a later date.
Rebeck pointed to the establishment of metrics in order to evaluate graduate programs as a major accomplishment during his term. So far, metric analysis has been used for masters programs, and the university is still in the process of forming a metric analysis system to evaluate doctoral programs.
“We have dozens of masters programs, almost 20 Ph.D. programs, and each of them need to know how they’re doing. Are they getting better? Are they attracting better students, more students?” he said. “This was not being done in any systematic way in the university, so the provost does not know which ones are doing well, which ones need more money.”
Kelly Otter took over the role of dean of the School of Continuing Studies on July 1 from Interim Dean Walter Rankin, who held the role for two years. Otter previously served as the associate dean for graduate academic and faculty affairs at Northeastern University’s College of Professional Studies.
Having worked in higher education, specifically adult professional education, for nearly 20 years, Otter found the position at Georgetown appealing because of the school’s Jesuit mission.
“The commitment of a university with a Jesuit mission is consistent with the goal of adult professional education,” Otter said. “We’re constantly looking outward to build bridges and contribute to the community, and to give back is what we do as educators.”
At Georgetown, Otter found a strong foundation built by previous deans like Rankin, who oversaw the transition of the SCS to a new downtown building.
Even with the recovery of the economy, Otter acknowledged that the SCS will face the challenge to remain relevant and active in the next 10 years, resulting in a strong focus on the importance of technology.
“A good part of every day for my staff is how we can use technology in our education. We need to build an infrastructure to support it,” she said. “It’s particularly important for the SCS, because people want to get an online education because we’re meeting the needs of people who often already have an undergraduate education and demanding jobs.”
Martin Iguchi stepped down from his position as dean of the School of Nursing and Health Studies on July 31. Patricia Cloonan, previously chair of the department of health systems administration, succeeded him as interim dean on Aug. 1.
After serving on Georgetown’s faculty for nearly 20 years, Cloonan said she was excited about her new position. Iguchi was not available for comment.
“Enduring qualities of the school have kept me invested all of these years,” she wrote in an email. “I point to strong student-faculty connections, a tight-knit peer environment, innovative approaches to education and research, a values-based framework that is inspired by the university’s Jesuit identity, and a serious focus on an issue that matters to everybody — health.”
Cloonan credited Iguchi for strong leadership and a smooth transition.
“I deeply appreciate his hard work and dedication to the school,” she wrote. “During his time as dean, he launched a strategic planning process to chart the course of the school for the next several years. As interim dean, I plan to work with our executive faculty, academic leadership team, staff members, and students to advance and implement that plan.”
The School of Foreign Service is still in the process of finding a dean to replace Carol Lancaster (SFS ’64), who stepped down to devote time to recovery from a brain tumor. The university is set to announce a search committee for the permanent position soon.
“The process will take the better part of the academic year, so I would suspect that the new dean would be announced next spring and probably would take effect over the summer or in the early part of the academic year,” SFS Interim Dean James Reardon-Anderson said.
Robert Gallucci, who served as dean of the SFS for 13 years, prior to Lancaster, will return as a distinguished professor in the practice of diplomacy, after a stint as the president of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. He will teach one class each semester.
“I look forward to renewing acquaintances with faculty, staff and administration, and becoming an active member of the university community once again,” Gallucci said in a press release.

What is the Iguchi story?  Obviously he stepped down, but why?  Why such a short tenure as dean?

The Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation partnered with the U.S. Department of Education to collaborate on the White House’s My Brother’s Keeper initiative, which aims to create more opportunities for minority men and boys.
The Beeck Center held two meetups prior to an Aug. 2 data jam, during which a wide array of community members were presented with data and tasked with highlighting problems in the community and finding solutions to the problems at hand.
“There are people now who are taking data and creating narratives around the data in really unique and interesting ways, so it’s not just a pie chart. They’re creating something that’s updating live, and there’s data being constantly fed into it,” Program Manager for Innovation and New Media Z. Michael Wang (MSB ’07), who works for the Beeck Center, said. “And I think our goal is to say, ‘These data sets were just released a couple months ago, so what we can do with it is still really new.’”
President Barack Obama launched the MBK initiative in February 2014 with the aim to build on pre-existing community efforts to combat the economic and social disparities between white males and males of color. For example, according to a White House press release, 86 percent of black boys and 82 percent of Hispanic boys are reading at levels below proficiency by the fourth grade, a marked increase from the 58 percent of white boys reading below proficiency levels by that age.
Beeck Center Executive Director Sonal Shah stressed the importance of data visualization, or imagining creative ways to interpret data and statistical correlations, that apply to society at large. The MBK data jam examined statistics taken from poor communities, such as distance to higher-paying jobs and possible correlations between violence and job training.
“You can’t solve what you can’t see. The data jam and visualization will help us look at the available data and information to help us better visualize and assess the data to see if we might be missing something,” Shah wrote in an email prior to the event.
Of the preceding meetups, one involved the Georgetown community and one involved members of the D.C. community. For the data jam, the center aimed to bring together a diverse group of individuals from both within and outside of the Georgetown community in order to foster new ideas from a variety of unique perspectives.
“To the testament of the people who have shown up, we’ve had everyone from K-12, principals of charter schools, administrators of universities to data scientists,” Wang said. “We’ve reached out to a lot of the community to get people who would normally not be involved, who would never come to an education-focused problem solving session. I think diversity was a big focus, to try and really bring in different perspectives.”
Programming and Assessment Analyst Alex Skarzynski (SFS ’15) said that the event perfectly epitomized the message and purpose behind the Beeck Center, which was founded this year.
“[It] is a great sort of idea that is, how do we have this old problem, the fact that there is this great disparity and disadvantages for boys and men of color, and how do you take a new solution to that, which is, let’s take this big data and let’s see how we can find new solutions out of it,” he said. “It allows people to be a little more innovative, and it allows people to re-examine and relook at all these sorts of things. So it’s very much part of our ethos of finding these new solutions to old problems.”
According to Wang, as an added incentive, the best ideas generated during the data jam session will be presented to Deputy Secretary of Education Jim Shelton 30 to 45 days after the event.
He said he hopes that the session can result in new ideas and interesting data visualizations in response to the provided federal data, which will help jumpstart the enactment of new policies that will put these ideas in action.
“I always jokingly compare it to the yellow arrow in Mario Kart. It’s not the end of the race, it supercharges how fast you’re going,” Wang said. “We hope this day is a supercharger that inspires teams to work together over a 30 or 45 day period where they continue to put together a more refined data visualization and come up with an idea.”
In order to be most effective, these initiatives need to be put into practice long-term, he said.
“Making it sustainable is the challenge at hand,” Wang said.
Shah also emphasized the importance of not only generating the ideas, but also putting them to use.
“While the data provides us better insight, it is in how we more effectively use the data to help the poor and those without access to greater opportunity that will matter,” Shah wrote.
Wang said he looked forward to the start of the semester when students would return to campus, thus bringing more energy and enthusiasm to the initiative.
“We did a lot of the planning without the students on campus but I think the biggest takeaway is that this is so early on. When all the students and grad students are back, it’s just going to be amazing,” he said.

This year’s nautical-themed New Student Orientation, “Anchors Aweigh,” led by about 180 orientation advisors, began Aug. 23, featuring the new “I Am Ready,” a class-wide discussion about sexual assault on campus.
The Sexual Assault Peer Educators and various members of the administration helped develop the “I Am Ready” program, which organized the freshman class, composed of approximately 1,700 students, into small groups of 15 to 25 for discussion.
Bethan Saunders (SFS ’17) facilitated discussion for one of the many groups after extensive training and education in regard to the subject.
“‘I Am Ready’ is really about facilitating discussion on campus about sexual assault and about how we can create, as a community, a culture of caring and consent, education on bystander behavior, and education about access to resources that we have on campus,” Saunders said.
Matt Beshke (COL ’18), said the discussion was a surprise, but turned into a positive learning experience.
“I wasn’t expecting it,” Beshke said. “Going into NSO, I wasn’t expecting it to be that heavy of an element, but I’m glad that it was something that they addressed, because it was recognized as a problem on college campuses.”
The discussion groups helped introduce students to potentially new concepts and ideas that are necessary to create an aware, educated and thoughtful group of new students, Saunders said.
“We really want to get across the idea that this is something that we talk about here at Georgetown, and sexual assault is completely unacceptable,” she said. “We wanted to make sure that people who may have never talked about this before understand the Georgetown policy, understand the repercussions of this type of action and understand what they can do to create a culture that’s safe.”
Beshke said he enjoyed the discussion, and that it allowed a variety of students with different levels of knowledge of sexual assault to interact well.
“The two leaders did a great job of talking about ways we can seek help and also bring to light issues that weren’t on the forefront of my mind,” Beshke said. “The kids in the room were receptive to what was being talked about and, as a whole, we were able to have a conductive conversation and a good dialogue between people who knew about sexual assault and those who were trying to learn more.”
One of NSO’s flagship events is the Marino Family International Writers’ Workshop. Funded by Frederick Marino (SLL ’68), this program requires all incoming students to read an international text chosen by a board of Georgetown teachers and staff members and write a short reflection on what they have read. During NSO, the students discuss the book with their peers and get a chance to listen to the author speak.
According to Coordinator of Communications, Outreach and Programming for Main Campus libraries Jennifer Ann Smith, the workshop gives new students a preview of their future academic environment.
“The Marino Workshop is the introduction to the ‘life of the mind’ at Georgetown,” Smith said. “It is intended to give new students a low-pressure opportunity to critically engage with the material and discuss a piece of literature with their peers, with the added opportunity to hear directly from the author about the book.” This year, the Marino Workshop committee, composed of staff members and teachers, chose Dinaw Mengestu’s (COL ’00) novel ‘All Our Names.’ This is the second time Mengestu, who is also the Lannan Foundation Chair of Poetics in the English department, has been chosen for the workshop, which according to Smith, is a coincidence.
“Dinaw’s book had received glowing reviews and a member of our committee suggested it, and that’s how we ended up selecting him this year,” Smith said. “He was also the featured author three years ago, but that didn’t really factor into our decision, since none of the students this year would have been involved in that workshop.”
Beshke said that the international requirements for the book helped introduce new students to Georgetown’s culture.
“I think that’s a good thing to have as the incoming book because Georgetown is a really international community. It’s a good touching ground point for NSO, because so many kids here are interested in different cultures,” he said.
Mengestu spoke to the students, and according to Beshke, his speech brought a new dimension to “All Our Names.”
“It was cool to be able to hear from him in person and hear his perspective on why he wrote the book and how his life connected with the topics that were discussed in the book,” Beshke said. “It brought the book to life a little more because the book wasn’t as relatable as I would have liked.”
After hearing him speak, students discussed Mengestu’s book in small 10- to 20-person discussion groups led by faculty and a few students. The discussions were conducted seminar-style and topics will vary depending on the group.
New students at the School of Foreign Service campus in Doha, Qatar, participated in the workshop.

After defeating incumbent Mayor Vincent Gray in the Democratic primary in April, D.C. Councilmember Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4) has taken the lead in campaign fundraising as well.
Having collected over $1 million in campaign funds, she has a clear financial advantage over her other competitors, including former D.C. Councilmember Carol Schwartz and D.C. Councilmember David Catania (I-At Large) (SFS ’90, LAW ’94).
According to his campaign, Catania has managed to raise about $465,000 in funds, and aims to reach $1 million by this fall.
“For a non-establishment candidate, those are impressive numbers, and those are the numbers of a winning campaign,” Catania’s campaign manager Ben Young told The Washington Post. “The establishment candidate will always have more.”
With just over $50,000 in her campaign, Schwartz has relied heavily on the use of volunteers to collect over 6,500 signatures on her petitions.
She claimed that Catania and Bowser have taken contributions from both corporations and from LLCs, a practice Schwartz criticized, allowing them to take more than the $2,000 maximum donation from each corporation. This practice will be banned in a law that will take effect on Jan. 1. In order to show her support for the upcoming law, Schwartz said she will not take any contributions from LLCs.
“What I’m doing, is I like the law that’s going into effect on Jan. 1, 2015, so I’m putting it into effect during my election in 2014. And I’m saying that leaders have to lead, set the example,” she said in an interview with THE HOYA. “Leaders have to set the example, and I’m setting the example. And they could have done it too, and chose not to.”
Although Bowser has snagged every other organized labor endorsement in the city, Catania boasts an endorsement from the D.C. Police Union, thus strengthening his efforts to improve public safety in the District.
“I think he has the background and the understanding necessary to manage the complexities of District government,” D.C. Police Union chairman Delroy Burton told The Washington Post.
Catania, who left the Republican Party in 2004, stressed the importance of improving the quality of public education as a means to prevent crime, an issue Bowser and Schwartz have emphasized as well.
“The intersection between education and public safety is obvious,” he said in a public announcement Wednesday. “When so many of our young people are not properly educated, they often choose lives in the illegal economy, for lack of a better term. What we have to do is make sure our education system is up and functioning. I think that is a public safety platform.”
Bowser’s education policy promises to invest more resources in order to improve middle schools in the District, provide more technical education and vocational training to prepare young D.C. citizens to enter the workforce and to make sure that all D.C. residents, regardless of age, have access to training in the science, technology, engineering and math fields.
Carol Schwartz, a former D.C. councilmember and five-time mayoral candidate who left the Republican Party in 2013, said that education would be the key focus.
“I want to make education the number one priority,” she said.
Schwartz said that as a former member of the Board of Education, she would be well-qualified to make policies as mayor because of her 40-plus years of experience.
“I have had experience, hands-on experience, in every single level of our government, and in addition, my record on both the Board of Education and on the Council are exemplary,” Schwartz said.
The election will take place Nov. 4.

After being nominated by President Obama in July to the U.S. Court of Appeals, visiting law professor Victoria Nourse will now join the White House as counsel to Vice President Joe Biden.
“I am delighted to serve my country and the vice president,” Nourse wrote in an email.
Nourse is known for her writings on constitutional history, legislation, separation of powers and criminal law.
“Victoria Nourse is a superb scholar, and she is also someone who has made great contributions as a public servant,” Georgetown Law Dean William M. Treanor said in a statement. “She is extraordinarily well-equipped to serve in this important role as the vice president’s chief lawyer.”
Nourse graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Stanford University in 1980 and earned her law degree from University of California’s Boalt Hall School of Law in 1984, graduating Order of the Coif.  She clerked for Judge Edward Weinfeld of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York City, before working as a litigation associate at the New York Office of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton, and Garrison from 1985 to 1987.
In 1987 she joined the Senate Committee to Investigate at the Iran-Contra Affair as an assistant counselor. She represented federal agencies in the U.S. Court of Appeals as a member of the Civil Appellate Staff of the U.S. Department of Justice in 1988, and then in 1990, she joined the Special Counsel to U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee as chief lawyer handling crime and drug laws. She later served as senior advisor to then-Senator Biden, helping him draft the Violence Against Women Act, a component of the Biden-Hatch Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.
In 1993, she became an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin School of Law in Madison, where she is still a member of the faculty. In 2008, she was named a LQC Lamar Professor at Emory School of Law.  She has worked as a visiting professor at the University of Maryland School of Law, Yale Law School, New York University School of Law and the Georgetown University Law Center.
