Following renewed scrutiny over memorials to Confederate leaders in Washington, D.C., federal and local officials are pushing for the removal of such monuments from public property.
The increased activism coincides with a decision from the Washington National Cathedral on Wednesday to remove two stained-glass windows featuring Confederate Gens. Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson and comes after violent confrontations between white nationalists and counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Va., last month.
Most recently, around 100 people who marched from Charlottesville to D.C. to protest the white nationalist rally arrived at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on Wednesday.
The Aug. 12 “Unite the Right” rally, justified by organizers as a protest of the planned removal of a statue of Gen. Lee in a Charlottesville public park, resulted in three deaths, 38 nonfatal injuries and 11 arrests.
Far-right demonstrators marched through the University of Virginia campus the night of Friday, Aug. 11 chanting slogans of “white power” and “Jews will not replace us.” The following day, Gov. Terry McAuliffe (R-Va.) declared a state of emergency before the rally, and police ordered the crowds to disperse, following skirmishes between groups of demonstrators. A car later plowed through a crowd, killing one person and injuring 19 others.
The Department of Justice is investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism, 115 miles from Georgetown University.
Washington Officials Respond
Democratic congressional leaders and District officials are calling for the removal of Confederate monuments from the U.S. Capitol.
Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.)  introduced identical legislation Thursday proposing the removal of Confederate statues from the Capitol building. Currently, 12 statues in the Capitol’s National Statuary Hall depict people connected to the Confederacy, including Gen. Lee and Jefferson Davis, the Confederacy’s president.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has expressed support for Rep. Lee and Booker’s Confederate Monument Removal Act.
President Donald Trump has roundly condemned efforts to remove statues. After a tepid initial response to the violence in Charlottesville, Trump blamed “both sides” for the violence.
“This week, it’s Robert E. Lee. I notice that Stonewall Jackson’s coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week, and is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?” Trump said at a press conference Aug. 15.
District officials have most recently voiced support for the removal of a statue of Albert Pike, a Confederate general and lifelong slavery proponent, standing in Judiciary Square.
Pike’s statue is the only outdoor statue depicting a Confederate official on federal land in D.C. Thirteen outdoor statues in the District depict Union military officials from the Civil War.
D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine joined more than half of the D.C. Council in cosigning a letter to National Parks Service Acting Director Michael T. Reynolds calling for the permanent removal of the Pike statue.
“We in the District of Columbia hold dear the values of equality, diversion, and inclusion, which are in direct conflict with the values embodied by the statue of Albert Pike,” the letter reads.
D.C. Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large) said he is hopeful these calls for removal will be successful.
“If we keep chipping away, eventually we’ll get to a place where the United States and the citizens of the United States recognize the need for us to revisit history and to try to correct some wrongs that we’ve committed,” Grosso said in an interview with The Hoya. “And that includes apologizing for slavery, apologizing for the role that we’ve had in oppressing African-Americans in our country.”
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) have expressed support for this effort. Norton announced in a press release Aug. 15 she will meet with Reynolds to directly discuss the removal of the Confederate statues.
LaToya Foster, Bowser’s press secretary, said Bowser also supports the removal of the statue of Pike.
“Across the South, cities are removing outdoor statues of Confederate leaders. Here in the nation’s capital, there is one on National Park Service land. We believe the National Park Service should remove the Pike statue and seek public input on which historical figure should replace it,” Foster wrote in an email to the Hoya.
Georgetown Experts React
Georgetown history professor Adam Rothman, whose research focuses on slavery in America, said current removal efforts differ from those that first took place two years ago.
In 2015, Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) introduced a resolution to remove Confederate imagery, including that found on the Mississippi flag, from the state Capitol building in the aftermath of Dylann Roof’s violent assault on a historically black church in Charleston, S.C., that killed six women and three men. House Republicans blocked that measure, arguing state residents should decide.
“Now, the focus has shifted [from the flag] to monuments. And it is part of a long process. I mean, there have been people protesting the monuments really from the moment that they were erected,” Rothman said. “But, I think it’s just more recently that, for a whole variety of reasons, those calls have gained political traction.”
Rothman said the debate has taken on greater significance due to the rise of explicit neo-Nazism, white nationalism and the self-described “alt-right,” which, according to Rothman, has been emboldened in part by Trump’s refusal to publicly condemn far-right extremist groups.
Rothman said the erection of Confederate memorials is the result of a racist history.
“They tend to be put up in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as part of the emergence of a cult of the Lost Cause, of the glorification of the Confederacy at a moment when Jim Crow is descending on the landscape — this disenfranchisement and segregation and violence,” Rothman said.
In the same vein, Rothman said the wave of statues constructed in the 1950s was a massive resistance to desegregation, meaning that the construction of these monuments had clear political implications beyond merely documenting history.
Georgetown sociology and African-American studies professor Leslie Hinkson pushed back against the idea of fixing history by tearing down the monuments.
“I am sort of in the camp of being very, very weary of erasing certain parts of our history, not that those parts of our history should be glorified, but that, if we erase those parts of our history that are unpalatable to some and that don’t necessarily put us in the best light, that we are censoring, in many ways, and that we are actually just trying to put forth our best selves,” Hinkson said. “We need to constantly learn from those parts of our history that might actually be unsavory and unpalatable.”
Hinkson said she recognized the common logic behind removing the statues — that they serve as painful reminders of the past for many and that they are not just artifacts. However, she emphasized the importance of using the statues as educational tools for the present.
“Can you imagine the German government just razing all of the concentration camps, for example? I think that would be a total sanitizing of their history,” Hinkson said. “Without those concentration camps still being there, it would provide a lot of fodder to the alarming number of Holocaust deniers that still exist today.”
Hinkson said she would express support for compromising through the addition of expanded context for the monuments.
“It’s remarkable to me how many of the monuments we have that don’t even give you the name of the individual. So, regardless of whether or not you’re meant to be learning from it or you’re meant to be honoring that individual, you have no idea how to do so,” Hinkson said.

Five Georgetown undergraduate students learned about urban development during a seven-day trip to Jakarta, Indonesia, in June, sponsored by the McCourt School of Public Policy’s Baker Center for Leadership and Governance.
The students, guided by Baker Center Director Victoria Canavor, met with the heads of institutions and organizations like the City Council of Jakarta, IBM and the International Labor Organization to understand and resolve the question of inclusivity in the smart cities of the future.
Canavor said that the program gave students access to the ideas and technology shaping modern urban development.
“I think they could not have responded as effectively had they not had the opportunity to meet with those leaders,” Canavor said. “For example, with Smart City Jakarta, they got a chance to see and visit all of the new, modern technology sites, which allowed them to experience it all real-time.”
Toward the end of the program, the students collaborated with counterparts from Harvard University, the University of Chicago and BINUS University Indonesia to present a concrete proposal on inclusive smart growth to the leaders and stakeholders.
Canavor said that this collaboration was part of an effort to build the students’ ability to collaborate with people from different backgrounds.
“The goal of this trip was to provide five promising undergraduate Georgetown students from different backgrounds and majors a unique learning experience focused on honing their ‘cultural intelligence’ skills: the ability to cross divides and thrive in diverse cultures,” Canavor said.
The students lived in the dorms of BINUS University. Canavor considered that this dynamic living situation made the program more appealing and educational.
“They lived in the dorms and experienced local Indonesian lifestyles. It was a short but immersive program where the local perspective was a key aspect; the students’ understanding of how Jakarta could be a more inclusive smart city would have been incomplete without it.”
Libby Bassini (SFS ’19), who went on the trip, said the interaction with local people and conditions was crucial for understanding the problem and addressing it appropriately.
“Being on-the-ground in Jakarta made me realize the importance of asking locals to add context to a problem to best provide a sustainable solution,” Bassini wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Local input is key to being practical about how to address an issue practically and effectively.”
Hunter Estes (SFS ’19) said that the contrasts evident in the country reminded him of the importance of addressing issues with a communal mindset.
“On a walk the day we got there, I noticed a small trash-filled canal that ran through the heart of the city. Across the small canal lay complete, abject poverty,” Estes said. “Loose pieces of scrap metal were thrown on crumbling buildings to provide some semblance of protection from the fierce rains that hit the city.”
However, Estes considered that the Indonesian political and business leaders were committed to addressing the prevailing inequality and fostering development for all. He argued that American leaders should adopt a similar mentality.
“I found the spirit of entrepreneurship to be alive and well in Jakarta. City leaders were aware of the problems that the city faced and were committed to fixing them,” Estes said. “I think this approach could be better employed in our local governments to address communal issues.”

As a student entrepreneur, Anthony Marshi (COL ’18) learned firsthand the difficulties new startups encounter and the lack of resources to guide them through the process.
In response, Marshi and Theodore Montgomery (SFS ’18) founded Georgetown Ventures, a new student club under the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative dedicated to providing financial advice and assistance to undergraduate startups. The club launched this fall and began accepting applications Sept. 2.
“I had a startup called Newsroom. I went through the process of taking advantage of a bunch of the resources that are offered on campus,” Marshi, who is president of the club, said. “The resources are in place at Georgetown to help you grow your startup; there isn’t an organization dedicated to guiding you through the process of leveraging those resources.”
The new club is a startup accelerator for promising undergraduate startups. According to Montgomery, vice president of Georgetown Ventures, the club’s purpose is to provide advice, consulting and financial assistance to individual startups.
The new club falls under the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative in the McDonough School of Business. The initiative aims to help promote the spirit of entrepreneurship on campus and helps student entrepreneurs grow their startups. Georgetown Ventures will be working with Startup Hoyas, another organization under the the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative that helps student startups on campus.
Professor Jeff Reid, co-founder of the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative, said Georgetown Ventures can offer more personal support to startups.
“We feel like we could offer more support to those students who are willing to pursue their startup while still in school. Georgetown Ventures’ primary goal is to provide peer-to-peer advocacy and support for student startups,” Reid wrote in an email to The Hoya.
According to Alex Heintze (MSB ’19), board member for Startup Hoyas, Georgetown Ventures is able to provide services that Startup Hoyas did not in the past.
“We definitely saw certain gaps in our own gaps in our own programming, specifically in regard to actually giving real advice to current student startups,” Heintze said.
With the creation of another club that provides support to startups, Heintze said Startup Hoyas can prioritize hosting large events celebrating student businesses.
“We are going to focus more on the pitch competition celebratory events that we typically have and then also speaker series. Whereas Georgetown Ventures will work more specifically with current student run startups, providing funding and advice when necessary,” Heintze said.
According to Marshi, Georgetown Ventures provides grant funding to student startups so that they can overcome crucial financial barriers and further grow.
“We understand that startups need some sort of funding to start. We know that giving them a few thousand dollars can make a big difference,” Marshi said. “A lot of people have good ideas, but they don’t necessarily have the necessary resources to start up. This is where we come in with that boost.”
Montgomery said Georgetown Ventures’ funding will enable the entrepreneurship community on campus to be more inclusive of all students on campus.
“We want to provide to students of all socioeconomic backgrounds this very valuable opportunity,” Montgomery said.
According to Marshi, Georgetown Ventures takes no equity in the student companies it advises to better focus on helping startups with financial consulting support.
“Startups can feel comfortable that we aren’t out there to take control. We are there to help them to whatever their next stage is,” Marshi said.
In addition to funding, Georgetown Ventures also aims to provide personal consulting to various student startups. Marshi said consultants will play active roles in the business.
“What we want is our consulting teams to give advice, but also to help the startup implement that advice. We want our consultants to be involved in the day-to-day operations of the startups,” Marshi said.
Georgetown Ventures hopes to do its part to make the campus community a better place for both students and entrepreneurs.
“A lot of startup ideas never get heard in the first place. We want to change that because there is a lot of potential that is unspoken,” Marshi said.

President Donald Trump’s administration has not devoted enough attention to issues affecting the LGBTQ community in America, counsel and HIV project director at Lambda Legal and former member of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS Scott Schoettes said at a keynote Thursday.
Schoettes, who is openly HIV-positive, resigned from the advisory council along with five colleagues in June after months of uncertainty about his position following Trump’s election.
“During the election, it became clear that candidate Trump was not interested in engaging with us or talking to us,” Schoettes said. “HIV advocates met with the Clinton campaign, and with the Sanders campaign, and got to talk about HIV and how they would handle things if they became president. Trump, no.”
Most of the councilmembers stayed on the council believing that they could do good, according to Schoettes, despite discouraging actions from the White House, including eliminating all references to the Office of National AIDS Policy from its website.
“I decided, along with other people, to stick around because there was an opportunity to do good,” Schoettes said. “There was an opportunity to shape what the administration was doing and what they were thinking. Yes, I disagreed with them and their philosophy and so much of what they stand for but, maybe I can do some good.”
Trump’s management of the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, however, proved the tipping point for Schoettes. It was a sign of the President’s disengagement with his policies and the people they were affecting, Schoettes said.
“In that process, it became clear to me that we had a president who really didn’t care what that repeal looked like. He just wanted a deal. He wasn’t engaged in the actual mechanics of how to make this work,” Schoettes said. “Enough, I finally came to a point where I felt like I could not advise a president on policy who’s not actually engaged in thinking about diplomacy.”
With HIV/AIDS becoming a disease of the unprivileged — with women of color, impoverished and transgender individuals being the most affected by the stigma and the lack of access to treatment — Schoettes said he valued his closeness to the Obama administration and its healthcare policies.
“We were making progress, that’s the encouraging thing. As I came on to the PACHA, we were starting to see actual changes. We had more people engaged in care, more people receiving anti-retroviral therapies and more people virally suppressed,” Schoettes said. “It was exciting because we felt like we were actually helping to make policy.”
Schoettes said he did not want his resignation to go unnoticed – after communicating his decision to the rest of the group, he waited for at least four other members who would follow him.
“I believed that by leaving — and if I could leave and make a big enough noise when I left, which I did by getting five people to come with me — then we could maybe force this a little bit into the dialogue,” Schoettes said.
Additional resignations have reduced PACHA to less than half of its total membership and no one has been appointed yet to lead the Office of National AIDS Policy.
Though the White House has recently played lip service to the issue, for instance by issuing a statement during National HIV Testing Day on June 27, Schoettes said Trump’s confidantes, including Vice President Mike Pence, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price, continue to exert a conservative influence on his political beliefs.
In August, the White House announced it was moving forward with a ban on transgender people serving in the military, a policy Schoettes said may have been influenced by some of Trump’s hard right advisers.
“I think some of these policies we’re seeing now, I’d say, transgender people in the military, that’s been influenced by the other cabinet members,” Schoettes said.
Schoettes called for increased activism at the national, state and local levels.
“The places I think where advocacy can be done are with Congress, so really important that they continue to fund all the work that HHS is doing,” Schoettes said. “And then, at the more local level, there’s work to be done at the state level. There’s work to be done on Medicaid expansion. That would be a huge thing for this population.”

Entrenched authoritarian powers in the Middle East can ultimately be democratized with U.S. intervention, according to Danielle Pletka, vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.
“We have tons of leverage. We are the most powerful country in the world, we are the richest country in the world. What we don’t have is the moral clarity, we don’t have the vision, and we don’t necessarily have the tools or leadership to do this,” Pletka said.
Pletka kicked off the Center for Jewish Civilization’s speaker series this semester with a talk at the Mortara Center on Wednesday on foreign policy in the Middle East.
Pletka disagreed with scholars who spend much of their time trying to place blame for the “systemic rot” occurring in the region, casting doubt on common claims that Arab culture or Islam are the roots of the problem.
“The notion that we all stick together and talk about the failing of one of the world’s great religions, and that this is really what has held people back, seems patently on its face not to be right,” Pletka said. “There are plenty of Muslim democrats. Indonesia, although it’s having its share of troubles, is a democracy. Bangladesh, although it’s having a lot of problems, has for many years been a quasi-functioning democracy.”
According to Pletka, the main problem facing the Middle East is the systems of governance that have been established in much of the region, including the legacy of Western influence on the region.
“Since the end of the colonial era in the region, there have been imported any number of lousy Western ideologies that have waned and waxed in popularity over the decades,” Pletka said. “There were the monarchies, but many of the monarchies that existed in the aftermath of colonial era and of World War I and World War II were replaced with nominal republics. Those then were replaced with dictatorships.”
Pletka spoke on the various failed movements in the Middle East including Arab socialism and Pan-Arabism in countries such as Syria and Egypt. However, she argued the failure of such movements is a result of the deep entrenchment of many Middle Eastern countries in systems of authoritarian government rather than an incapacity for democracy.
“What each of these regimes have in common is they are fundamentally authoritarian or totalitarian regimes. They’re dictatorships. It should come as no surprise to us that for people in the region who grow with this frame of reference, knowing nothing else other than totalitarianism in their government, they don’t have the frame of reference,” Pletka said.
“People don’t actually know how to do democracy when they’ve never done it before.”
Pletka then made a case for the involvement of the United States and other democratic countries in the Middle East. According to Pletka, these countries have a responsibility to bring democracy to areas of the region and play a part in shaping the advancement of human rights, stressing the significance of addressing instability in the Middle East for the sake of the United States’ own security.
“These are dangerous, virulent ideas that have spread. These are dangerous conflicts, these are dangerous weapons, and when we don’t deal with them there they come find us here,” Pletka said. “We’ve learned to tolerate a low level of unpleasantness that comes with a small terrorist attack because these aren’t shaping our societies. But actually, they do, because small attacks become large attacks. I would argue that Al Qaeda is more powerful now than it was on September 10, 2001.”
Pletka concluded with a final appeal for democracy in the region and affirmed the ability of the United States to defeat its shortcomings in intervention.
“I think the Arab Spring was absolute evidence of that desire for freedom and absolute evidence of the inability of the region to provide that,” she said. “We are engaged in this part of the world. We do have relationships. What we see is every time we pull back countries come to us and ask us to be involved.”

Now is the time to discuss climate change policy, according to Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu (LAW ’94) of California.
Lieu spoke at the Social, Economic and Financial Challenges in Energy Inclusion event in the Healey Family Student Center on Wednesday evening.
Lieu, who serves on the House Judiciary Committee and on the House of Foreign affairs Committee, gave the keynote address. Because Lieu was unable to attend the event in person because of an unexpected change in Congress’ voting schedule due to Hurricane Harvey, Lieu delivered the address remotely by telephone. Hosted by the Georgetown University & Santander Partnership on Social Economy, the event was part of the Annual Finance and Human Development Series.
The event also featured panels moderated by President of B360, Inc. Peter Karenge, PEPCO’s Vice President of Utility of the Future Karen Lefkowitz, the Director of the Department of Energy & Environment Tommy Wells and Georgetown history professor David Painter and McCourt School of Public Policy professor Paasha Mahdavi.
“Our overall aim of Georgetown University and the Santander Group is to contribute to social justice and to think of economy not just as the bottom line but more about how we can have a responsible economy, and that is how this particular event was conceived,” Mahdavi said.
Lieu advocated the importance of addressing the environment and climate change as a political issue.
“All of you [students] are there because you understand the importance of the environment and climate — not just to America but to humanity,” Lieu said. “One of the first bills I introduced in Congress last term took California’s landmark Global Warming Solutions Act and tried to make it national and set goals for our country to hit.”
According to Lieu, California’s Global Warming Solutions Act is relatively simple and sets clear goals. Under the law, California is aiming for a 40 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 compared to 1990 levels, and an 80 percent reduction by 2050.
“Fifteen years ago people were still questioning whether climate change was even happening. Many of them no longer question that. They realize that they cannot simply ignore the measurements and the facts and now the debate has shifted to ‘Well, we’re not really sure what is causing the climate to change,’” Lieu said.
Lieu suggested the increased frequency of extreme weather events such as Hurricanes Irma and Harvey may continue to hasten the public conversation about combatting climate change.
“Hopefully America realizes [the problem] before it’s too late. We’re fighting the fight on Capitol Hill and hopefully with the help of all of you we can continue to change hearts and minds and eventually get some climate change policy done,” Lieu said.
Lieu said efforts to counter climate change should note that it affects poorer communities most severely.
“When it gets hot in California, most of my constituents can turn on an air conditioner,” said Lieu, “But there are districts in America where when it gets very hot there are people who are going to die. Climate change does affect people differently depending on wealth and poverty level and access to resources, so I think it is important that we keep that in mind as we put out solutions to climate change.”
Lieu said his passion for the environment comes from a desire to improve the planet for future generations.
“The reason I’m so passionate about these issues is based on a quote I read long ago. It’s attributed to a Native American and says, ‘We don’t inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children,’” Lieu said. “I just want to make sure that my children and my grandchildren have an environment that is the same or better than what we have now — that is currently not the case. We’re about to pass on to our children and grandchildren a far worse environment.”

Georgetown reiterated its policy against social fraternities and sororities in a campuswide email Sept. 1, highlighting high-risk behaviors commonly associated with Greek life.
In the email — the third such message released by the university — Associate Vice President for Student Affairs Jeanne F. Lord cited risks associated with a Greek-centered social life, including hazing and substance abuse.
“Experience and national data have shown that social Greek organizations are often associated with serious high-risk behavior, including hazing and alcohol abuse,” Lord wrote. “Georgetown’s decision not to support a social Greek system reflects our concerns for the safety and well-being of our students, and is rooted in the values that have animated this university for more than two centuries.”
Lord also said the university’s co-curricular environment is a critical feature of its culture and environment.
“We are a community of women and men who bring diverse experiences, identities and traditions to the Hilltop,” Lord wrote. “When we come together in this community, these differences enrich our life together.”
The university has consistently opposed Greek life and sent similar emails to students in previous years. Last year’s statement received pushback from leaders of Greek organizations including Alpha Epsilon Pi and former Georgetown University Student Association President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and Vice President Chris Fisk (COL ’17).
“We’re involved in charity, we put on scholarship events, community service, educational forums,” Alpha Epsilon Pi Master Jack Rosenberg (SFS ’17) said in an article in The Hoya. “We fill a hole that obviously 10 percent of the student body is interested in.”
In their statement, Khan and Fisk said the members of Georgetown’s Greek community are “Hoyas first and foremost.”
“For many, Greek organizations are spaces to find community, enhance leadership skills and develop into women and men for others,” Khan and Fisk wrote. “By holistically meeting the individual needs of so many Hoyas, our Greek organizations are precisely what the standard of cura personalis demands.”
Khan and Fisk countered Lord’s message last year, writing that professional and social fraternities and sororities have higher acceptance rates than established on-campus student organizations and are generally accepted by a majority of Jesuit colleges and universities in the U.S.
Alexandra Williams (SFS ’19), a member of sorority Kappa Alpha Theta, said Lord’s email was disheartening and alienating.
“It was saddening to read the administration’s perspective on Greek life, which has been such a positive part of my experience here at Georgetown. Not only was the statement demeaning and dismissive, but hypocritical when the university endorses non-Greek campus groups that engage in the very activities that were highlighted,” Williams said. “I have met some of the most driven, kind and intelligent girls as part of Kappa Alpha Theta — girls who embody the ‘cura personalis’ that our school is so proud of.”
