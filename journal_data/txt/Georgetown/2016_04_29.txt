Fr. Richard Curry, S.J., 72
Professor of Catholic Studies and Theater
Fr. Richard Curry, S.J., who taught for 10 years at Georgetown and founded Dog Tag Bakery, died Dec. 20 from heart failure. The Jesuit was a fervent advocate for veteran and disability rights, serving as the director of the Academy for Veterans and subsequently founding Dog Tag in 2014. The Georgetown bakery, which employs veterans and their spouses, aims to help employees develop business acumen through night courses and real-life experience. On campus, Curry’s legacy was heard in the tap dancing clicks that echoed through the halls of the Intercultural Center. Through his “Theater and the Catholic Imagination” class, Curry taught students to shuffle-ball-change as a form of expression. Although Curry suffered from health problems in the last few years of his life, his students said that he always came to class with passionate energy, eager to develop close relationships with each and every one of them.
 
Nina Brekelmans (GRD ’15), 25
Recently Matriculated Graduate Student
One month before her death in an electrical fire in a townhouse in Dupont Circle, Nina Brekelmans (GRD ’15) graduated from Georgetown’s Master of Arts in Arab studies program with a near-perfect GPA. The brilliant scholar and nearly fluent Arabic speaker planned to study the experiences of female runners in Jordan with a Fulbright grant in the fall. She spent a gap year in Jordan in 2012 to improve her Arabic skills, and immediately fell in love with the place and its people. Each morning, she ran with female long-distance runners at a local stadium, forming close relationships and working to empower Jordanian women to participate in sports. Brekelmans was a talented runner herself, competing on the Dartmouth College team in her undergraduate days and participating in the Georgetown Running Club while getting her masters degree. She is survived by her parents, Gail and Nico Brekelmans and her brother Rob.
 
Edward “Eddie” Blatz Jr. (MSB ’17), 21
Student
Edward Blatz Jr. (MSB ’17), widely known by his nickname “Eddie,” was a talented and admired member of the men’s lacrosse team, for which he played defense. He died April 24 of unreported causes. Blatz graduated from Garden City High School in New York, where he played football, lacrosse and basketball. A 10-time letter winner for all three sports, Blatz was recognized as Garden City’s all-time leader in receptions and touchdown catches. At Georgetown, he majored in management and played in 25 games for the lacrosse team. Blatz is survived by his parents, Edward Blatz Sr. and Anne Marie, and two older sisters, Elizabeth and Jessica.
 
Rabbi Harold S. White, 83
Rabbi
As the university’s first full-time rabbi, Rabbi Harold S. White pioneered interfaith dialogue and cemented a presence for Jewish life on campus. He died of complications from a stroke Aug. 31. In his time at Georgetown, which began in 1968, White helped launch the Program for Jewish Civilization, delivered hugely popular sermons in Gaston Hall and performed wedding ceremonies for countless interfaith couples, including that of Vice President for Public Affairs Erik Smulson (CAS ’89). In his years on campus, White championed interreligious learning, and taught a popular class called “Interreligious Encounter and Dialogue” alongside Imam Yahya Hendi and PJC Associate Director Rev. Dennis McManus. His students remember him as a dynamic and engaging professor, but also one who valued challenging his own faith and understanding the faiths of others. White is survived by his son Ross McQuilkin.
 
Charles Cawley (CAS ’62), 75
Businessman and Donor
Any student who has performed on the stage of the Davis Performing Arts Center, met with counselors at the Cawley Career Education Center or studied in Sellinger Lounge has Charles Cawley (CAS ’62) to thank. The prominent businessman and donor, who died Nov. 18 at his home in Maine, served as the CEO of the MBNA Corporation for more than 20 years and consistently worked to improve programs and services at Georgetown. In addition to funding multiple construction projects, he also helped fund the College’s Baker Scholars Program, established and the 1111 Cawley/Murphy Scholarship. He is survived by his wife Julie and their two children, Michael Cawley (CAS ’86) and Maureen Cawley Rhodes (CAS ’88).
 
Nathan Kittredge “Kitt” Rom (SFS ’19), 19
Student
Known as a passionate, endlessly curious and adventurous freshman, Nathan Kittredge “Kitt” Rom (SFS ’19) died March 9 in a skiing accident in Colorado. The science, technology and international affairs major loved physics and chemistry, and applied his academic skills to his passion outside the classroom — brewing coffee. Rom, who worked at Saxbys, took his love for coffee outside the workplace, creating new concoctions for his friends in Darnall Hall and constantly working to improve his craft. He was also a spontaneous adventurer, who traveled around Italy, the United Kingdom, Thailand and Australia on a gap year. He is survived by his father Mark Rom, associate dean for academic affairs at the McCourt School of Public Policy, his mother and his brother Chris Rom (COL ’16), who will graduate in May.
 
FR. James P.M. Walsh, S.J., 77
Associate Professor of Theology and Celestial Chime
For more than 40 years, Fr. James P. M. Walsh, S.J., graced the community with an indelible legacy, one of speech and expression, of devout scholarship and of music. He died July 1 from myelofibrosis. Walsh, often known simply as “Jim,” pioneered the university’s creation of a speech and expression policy, and dedicated himself to making Georgetown a bastion of dialogue, expression and free discourse. In his academic life, Walsh studied social justice issues in the Bible, particularly the Old Testament, and brought his passion for theology alive in the classroom. The Jesuit also made a musical imprint on the Georgetown community, serving as the “Celestial Chime” in the all-male a cappella group for more than 30 years. The group remembers him as a fiercely loyal Chime, providing lasting friendship and mentorship for three decades of its members.

In light of an influx of families seeking shelter during a record-breaking winter storm this year, homelessness in Washington, D.C., became an increasingly prominent issue, with Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) recently announcing plans to close the city’s dilapidated D.C. General Family Shelter.
According to the District’s Interagency Council on Homelessness, there are an estimated 7,298 homeless individuals in the District on any given night. This includes 544 unsheltered persons, 5,085 individuals in emergency shelters and 1,669 residents in transitional housing.
In D.C.’s first Homeless Youth Census conducted in August, the D.C. Department of Human Services found that homelessness disproportionately affects LGBTQ youths, with 43 percent of the District’s 330 minors without shelter identifying as LGBTQ.
The D.C. ICH and Bowser have led concerted efforts to address the District’s homelessness crisis since September, when they launched “Homeward DC,” a plan that seeks to eliminate chronic homelessness by 2017 and all long-term homelessness by 2020. The mayor also committed $23 million of her $12 billion 2016 fiscal year budget to combat the crisis.
“Homelessness can seem so big and so insurmountable, but the fact is we can quantify the challenge,” Bowser said at the plan’s official announcement Sept. 1. “A city as prosperous as ours should and must solve the problem of homelessness.”
The plan proposed reforms to expand emergency housing options and enable the housing of families in both apartments and private rooms in addition to public facilities. The proposal also amended the Homeless Services Reform Act, which previously required individuals to prove they had no safe place to stay before being admitted to shelters. The amendment allowed for the provision of at least 12 days of interim housing to homeless citizens as the city determines their eligibility.
The reforms proved vital as nightly temperatures in the District began to plummet below freezing — a period known as “hypothermia season” — and the city faced an influx of more than 700 families seeking shelter in November. The season, which lasts from Nov. 1 to April 1, activates the right-to-shelter law that requires D.C. to provide housing to all homeless people. With shelters filled to capacity, the city resorted to renting motel rooms for 400 families.
Homelessness in the cold weather was further exacerbated by the arrival of Winter Storm Jonas on Jan. 22, which tied for the fourth-highest snowfall on record in the District and pummeled the city with over 2 feet of snow.
The storm prompted the D.C. Department of Human Services to set up temporary warming and overflow hypothermia shelters in recreational centers, libraries and churches throughout six of the District’s eight wards.
“Our staff is doing a whole host of things, making sure they have food, and a plan, meal cards and if need, making sure they have bags of groceries,” D.C. Department of Human Services Director Laura Zeilinger said to The Washington Post on Jan. 22. “Yes, they will be marooned, just like everybody in the city will be marooned. That’s why we’re getting out to them in advance.”
Shortly after the storm passed, Bowser unveiled an initiative Feb. 9 to replace D.C. General with facilities in each of the District’s eight wards. The shelter at D.C. General has come under fire for its allegedly poor living conditions, lack of security and staff misconduct since 8-year-old Relisha Rudd disappeared from the shelter in March 2014. Rudd still has not been found, despite the Metropolitan Police Department’s renewed search efforts in April at the U.S. National Arboretum.
Under the mayor’s initiative, the proposed shelters would house up to 50 families each and would cost an estimated $22 million annually to maintain, around $5 million more than is currently used to operate D.C. General. The total cost of the proposal is expected to reach $660 million over the next 30 years.
T
hough the plan initially received praise from District officials, as more details were revealed throughout March and April, it began to face criticisms over its potential costs. The D.C. Council, which was initially set to vote on the proposal April 19, postponed its consideration until the initiative is further fleshed out.
“We should not overpay for what we’re doing. If it’s worth $1 million, then we should pay $1 million — we shouldn’t pay $10 million,” Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) said to WAMU on April 6. “A lot of folks who are very knowledgeable about real estate say that we need to ask tougher questions about the cost.”
The initiative has met further resistance over its proposed shelter sites, particularly due to its plan to establish a facility in Ward 5 that would be in close proximity to a strip club, a waste-treatment facility, a nightclub and a large Metrobus depot.
Critics have also taken issue with a potential conflict of interest reported by The Washington Post on March 16, which indicated that the proposal — which would lease private land for shelters as well as use public property — has the potential to increase the value of properties owned by mayoral donors by up to 10 times.
As of now, the future of Bowser’s plan to address homelessness remains unclear, but the mayor has continued to push for its implementation, stressing the urgency of the crisis at hand.
“I urge us not to be distracted by arguments that are based on fear or convenience, or apples and oranges comparisons that falsely represent the cost of lifting our families out of homelessness,” Bowser said in her State of the District address March 22. “Because make no mistake, if we fail to act, we will fail.”

Kevin says 
April 29, 2016 at 1:40 pm
Developers made $18 million profit selling the Ward 2 site, expect the same from the other LEASED sites unless the Mayor stars looking at public owned land.

Faced with increased demand for resources in virtually all aspects of campus, the administration worked to address growing concerns in Georgetown’s academic, athletic and student life.
Academic Resource Center
With five academic coordinators responsible for the entire student population, the Academic Resource Center faced criticism for its tight quarters and inadequate resources in an external review submitted to the university in January.
The 14-page report, which was obtained by The Hoya in April and eventually leaked in full by disability rights activist Lydia Brown (COL ’15) on her blog, was conducted in October by Sheilah Shaw Horton, vice president for student development at Loyola University of Maryland, and Myrna Cohen, executive director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Weingarten Learning Resources Center.
Among the 15 recommendations included in the report, Cohen and Horton recommended moving the ARC office to a larger space and hiring two more full-time learning coordinators, noting the ARC’s “wheelchair inaccessible” location on the third floor of the Leavey Center, its “claustrophobic” testing room two floors above and its undersized staff.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, who requested the external review, said the conversations regarding hiring an additional full-time learning strategies coordinator and moving the ARC to a more spacious location are ongoing, but nothing has been finalized.
Both Olson and ARC Director Jane Holahan said the ARC is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The report cited an anonymous administrator who said, “At a university that prides itself on excellence, we are just meeting compliance.”
The ARC, which is housed under the Office of Student Affairs, is staffed by five full-time professionals on the main campus tasked with providing tutoring services, academic assistance and disability accommodations for the student body, which includes 750 students with registered disabilities and more than 800 varsity athletes.
Holahan and Associate Director Annie Tulkin coordinate academic support for all nonathletes, while Associate Director Shelly Habel serves as academic coordinator for all varsity student-athletes with the exception of the varsity basketball teams, which have their own coordinators. The men’s basketball team’s coordinator is housed under athletics, while the women’s basketball team coordinator is housed under the ARC.
The report pointed to the imbalance of the student-to-coordinator ratio as possibly contributing to a lack of attention for nonathletes without registered disabilities.
Unlike the varsity basketball coordinators who travel with their teams, Habel said she manages too many student-athletes to administer exams tha conflict with athletes’ schedules, except for finals. Monitoring 200 to 300 student-athlete schedules with priority during pre-registration, she said, forces her to devote her time to students who are already academically at risk.
“We have tried to rationalize the work in a way where I am doing more triage than I am day-to-day operations, which is unfortunate because it’s like an emergency room,” Habel said in an interview with The Hoya. “As opposed to proactive, it tends to be a little more reactive.”
Kehoe Field
With multimillion-dollar donations allocated for the construction of the John Thompson Jr. Athletic Center for varsity athletes and renovations of Cooper Field, Kehoe Field — used primarily by club and intramural teams — has fallen into disarray.
Located on the roof of Yates Field House, Kehoe Field was closed to all athletes Feb. 2 due to safety concerns. The field has been closed since 2007 to varsity practices.
At a Hoya Roundtable discussion held the day after the closure, Vice President for Facilities and Planning Robin Morey said the concrete roof beneath Kehoe’s turf was deteriorating. Additionally, the roof’s poor elevation angle prevents proper water drainage, causing further damage to the roof. As a result, the turf is riddled with divots, bumps and rippled surfaces.
Under current master-planning negotiations, Yates would be torn down and a new athletics center would be built where Shaw Field currently is, creating space for new fields. The development would cost approximately $75 million.
Morey said at the roundtable that the university will decide within 12 months whether it will repair Kehoe Field while waiting for the creation of the new athletics center.
The university is still considering its options for renovation. A $10 million renovation would take a year to cpmplete and last for 10 years, but a $30 million renovation would take 18 months to complete and last for 30 years.
Facing a potential 8 to 15 year closure under the campus plan, student athletes created a petition in March, urging the administration to speed up the rehabilitation process. The Advisory Board for Club Sports played a role in putting together the petition.
In an article in The Hoya (“Student Athletes Form Petition Protesting Kehoe Field Closure,” March 22, A5), Director of Yates Field House Jim Gilroy voiced his support for the petition.
“I would like to think that if several thousand students made it clear that this is really important to them that maybe somebody in the administration will listen,” Gilroy said.
Counseling and Psychiatric Services
Counseling and Psychiatric Services has long faced backlash from students for its inadequate resources, the high cost of counseling services and limited hours of operation. Continued student advocacy this year paved the way for CAPS and the Georgetown University Student Association Mental Health Committee to increase CAPS staff, provide free services and new programs to improve resources.
The fall semester saw the addition of two new CAPS staff members and the implementation of a Mental Health Advisory Board, which consists of students and administrators.
On April 24, GUSA launched Project Lighthouse, an anonymous peer-to-peer online chat service to enable anonymous communication, which received 25 student messages on its first day of operations. The initiative included more than 40 hours of training for peer volunteers with the support of CAPS and Health Education Services.
The new service is open 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. daily and is intended to connect students with peer-supporters to discuss issues ranging from stress and sleep problems to thoughts of self-harm.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson lauded the efforts to strengthen the university’s mental health services in conjunction with efforts by student associations.
“I am very encouraged by the partnerships this year between administrators and students to strengthen our campus Safety Net. Adding new staff members in CAPS, convening the Mental Health Advisory Board, and the launch of Project Lighthouse have all been very positive steps,” Olson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
CAPS Director Philip Meilman said the expansion of CAPS services is due in part to the growing need for increased mental health resources on campus.
“This has been a very active year for CAPS. Over the past decade we have seen more and more students for direct clinical services and a growing number of psychiatric hospitalizations for serious difficulties,” Meilman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As we work to take care of students, we have engaged in a number of other significant initiatives.”
According to Meilman, CAPS is planning on further increasing its staff over the course of the next few years and revisiting its medical leave procedures, an effort already in the works.
“Working with GUSA and other student leaders, we have conducted an extensive study of the medical leave process by bringing in an outside consultant who interviewed students, deans, CAPS staff, and others,” Meilman wrote. “We are working on a three-year plan to grow the size of the CAPS staff and are looking at options for additional space to accommodate an expanded staff.”

In a year dominated by student advocacy efforts to address issues at Georgetown from its history with slavery to divestment, workers’ rights has remained a prevalent issue on campus.
Student athletes called for the university to re-evaluate its relationship with Nike, which has been accused of mistreating factory workers, while the Georgetown Solidarity Committee launched its Work With Dignity Campaign in March to better recognize and demand improvements for university workers.
Evaluating Georgetown’s Relationship with Nike
In mid-April, University President John J. DeGioia penned a letter to Nike emphasizing the university’s code of conduct and encouraging them to cooperate with the Worker Rights Consortium, an independent labor rights monitoring body.
The university’s Licensing Oversight Committee recommended the letter be sent to Nike and also recommended requiring Nike to sign the university’s code of conduct. The LOC also recommended the university not renew Nike’s contract with the university in its current form.
The letter came after months of advocacy efforts by Georgetown athletes and workers’ rights advocates. Athletes and Advocates for Workers’ Rights wrote a letter to DeGioia in November encouraging the university to end its relationship with Nike. Twenty athletes and advocates signed the letter on student-athletes’ behalf.
AAWR was formed after a lecture by anti-sweatshop activist Jim Keady in November, who addressed working and living conditions at Nike factories in Asia.
The group held an open forum in early December, where the group discussed questions from student-athletes and prepared to meet with DeGioia. In March, former Nike garment worker and union president Noi Supalai discussed her experience working for Nike, including her difficulties receiving fair wages from the company.
AAWR lead organizer and LOC member Jake Maxmin (COL ’17) said it is critical for Nike to comply with the university’s code of conduct.
“The big thing for us is for Nike to oblige by our code of conduct. The upcoming end date [of the contract in early 2017] has given us some leverage with them,” Maxmin said.
Earlier in November, controversy arose after three student-athletes taped over the Nike logo on their university-provided shoes. Student-athletes are not allowed to alter university-provided apparel, according to the Student-Athlete Equipment Agreement that all student-athletes are required to sign.
Improving Workers’ Rights
When Winter Storm Jonas hit Washington, D.C., in January, workers were given the choice of staying on campus or staying at home without pay until the storm passed. Around 200 facilities workers stayed on campus overnight to shovel snow and keep campus operations running. Some of the workers did not have a bed to sleep in overnight.
The university was accused by the Georgetown Solidarity Committee of providing inadequate on-campus accommodations for the workers who chose to stay on campus. The GSC drafted a list of demands, including increasing university accountability, enforcing fair business practices, reforming hiring and staffing practices and treating workers with dignity and respect. These were delivered to administrators on March 16 as part of the group’s Work With Dignity campaign.
The demands were accompanied by a rally in Red Square on March 18, and an op-ed in The Hoya, in which GSC accused the university of violating the Just Employment Policy — established in 2005 to maintain fair labor practices and create a safe working environment — during Winter Storm Jonas.
GSC member Joseph Gomez (SFS ’19) said while the administration has not yet implemented concrete changes, the group is pleased with the progress made so far. “The standout achievement would probably be getting the attention of the administration,” Gomez said. “We’ve met with [Senior Vice President Christopher] Augustini and [Vice President for Public Affairs Erik] Smulson and a bunch of other workers, and engaging in dialogue of how the administration can work with culinary committee and the workers to implement the demands that we are seeking.”
Gomez praised the Georgetown community for its support for campus workers.
“I think Jesuit values are very progressive, and very caring for everybody and the whole person, and so because of that the student body is more aware of people in general,” Gomez said. “And then with the living wage campaign in 2005, that brought more awareness to the student body, and now kind of like culminating in what we’re doing now.”
Other student groups worked to support campus workers this year. Students of Georgetown, Inc.’s Social Impact Committee launched the Citizen Scholarship in March, which works to fund the citizenship process for facilities workers, in conjunction with the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and Working Poor and the D.C. Schools Project.
Febin Bellamy (MSB ’17) launched Unsung Heroes — a Facebook page that posts interviews and photos of Georgetown workers — on April 1 in an effort to increase recognition for university employees.
The project, which was initially developed as an assignment for philosophy professor Jason Brennan’s “Moral Foundations in Market Society” class last spring, is sponsored by the Clinton Global Initiative University.
“The style that we have used so far is just to get students to understand that [these workers] are human beings — they have stories. I think once students start seeing that, we’re going to continue doing that but it’s going to also be more action. Sort of like, now that we know that they exist, how do we give back to them?” Bellamy said.
GSC member Dan Zager (COL ’18) said students have generally been more attentive to workers’ rights compared to last year, when the group held rallies supporting Aramark workers’ demands for better working conditions.
Workers reached an agreement with Aramark in April 2015, which included implementing a process for unionization and improved working conditions and wages, after employees complained of managerial interference in the unionization process and poor work conditions.
“Having a campaign this year sort of built off of what we did last year — we won last year, that was big — and I think that along with Unsung Heroes has really shifted student perception to be more [supportive],” Zager said. “That along with what’s going on nationally, you’ve got a major democratic candidate Bernie Sanders who advocates for sort of the same issues that we’re advocating.”
Gomez said GSC will work to build on this year’s campaign next year.
“We’re going to continue, in the summer into next year, just to keep awareness, and keep everything — make sure that what we want is accomplished,” Gomez said.

As the issue of sexual assault on college campuses rose to the forefront of the national consciousness, advocacy efforts for awareness and policy reform at Georgetown also gained traction over the past academic year. From the hiring of the university’s first full-time Title IX coordinator, to the dissemination of the Sexual Assault and Misconduct Survey, to the waiving of Counseling and Psychiatric Services fees for survivors, this year witnessed significant advancements in advocacy and policy.
In late July, the publication of two survivors’ accounts shed light on the administration’s mismanagement of sexual assault cases and the need for more survivor resources.
On July 21, Zoe Dobkin (SFS ’16) and Willa Murphy co-authored an opinion piece in The Hoya (“I Stand With Willa, I Stand With Survivors,” thehoya.com, July 21, 2015) recounting Murphy’s ordeal with the university following her rape. Murphy claimed the university provided insufficient support after she reported the rape, which resulted in academic struggles and her subsequent expulsion.
Murphy’s account marked the beginning of the “#IStandWithWilla” campaign, which ignited dialogue on sexual assault at Georgetown. The following day, the Georgetown University Student Association convened with student activists and requested to meet with administrators to address concerns regarding the university’s sexual assault policy.
One week later, Olivia Hinerfeld (SFS ’17) documented her own experiences as a survivor in a viewpoint (“A Shared Obligation,” thehoya.com, July 29, 2015), in which she encouraged students to work in tandem with the university to create a more survivor-centric campus.
In mid-September, following two months of negotiations between GUSA and the administration, a memorandum of understanding was reached. Both parties committed to sexual assault policy reform and expanded programs, including increasing promotional material for survivor resources, furthering bystander education, expediting the development of a campus climate survey and hiring of a full-time Title IX coordinator.
Subsequent months saw the implementation of these initiatives. In December, the university hired Samantha Berner as the university’s first full-time Title IX investigator. On the first day of the spring semester, the university announced the appointment of Laura Cutway as the first full-time Title IX coordinator, a role that oversees the university’s sexual misconduct policy.
“I’d love to … provide a framework and confidence in our system so that people know what they would be getting involved in if they were to report [sexual misconduct], that they feel comfortable and confident in the process,” Cutway said in an interview with The Hoya.
With Cutway’s appointment, the university also disseminated the first Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey to develop an understanding of the prevalence of and attitudes toward sexual misconduct on campus. Modeled after a template from the Association of American Universities, the survey initially saw underwhelming participation from both undergraduate and graduate students. The university extended the survey completion deadline by a week, which resulted in a final participation rate of 51 percent of the entire student population, surpassing the university’s target by 1 percent. The results from the survey are expected to be released to the community in May.
Meanwhile, other offices and departments also continued their efforts to promote awareness and improve responses to sexual assault cases. The Georgetown University Police Department conducted a 40-hour training program for its 14-person Sexual Assault Response Team over spring break to clarify procedures on responding to sexual assault reports.
In April, CAPS began offering free semester-long services for sexual assault survivors and accused perpetrators, the result of a joint effort with GUSA. Under the new policy, students will receive a semester’s worth of treatment regardless of when they begin.
Toward the end of the semester, the university also released a new GOCard design that includes the phone numbers of five campus resources — including GUPD, CAPS and the D.C. Rape Crisis Center — on the back. Freshmen and transfer students arriving in fall 2016 will receive the new GOCards, while current students are now able to trade in their existing GOCard for the new version.
Looking ahead, both students and administrators agree that while substantial efforts have been made to create more awareness and visible resources for survivors, there remains room for improvement.
“The events of the past few months have continuously proven to me that Georgetown is committed to answering that call,” Hinerfeld wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Hinerfeld, who currently serves as GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff, said she hopes to see further initiatives in the next academic year, including a bystander intervention program that builds on I Am Ready, a mandatory training on campus sexual assault during New Student Orientation.
“Of course, our work is never finished,” Hinerfeld wrote. “We need to ensure that we are being responsive to the specific needs of the Georgetown community. Before I graduate, I hope to see the implementation of a new bystander intervention education program for student leaders and the development of a platform for students to report sexual assault online.”
At the third annual Sexual Assault Open Forum on April 20, Health Education Services Clinician and Sexual Assault Specialist Jennifer Wiggins said she would like to see more diversity in the sexual assault education community at Georgetown, noting that only 15 of the 60 students currently involved with the Sexual Assault Peer Educators program identify as male, and few students of color are represented.
At the forum, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said he looks forward to continuing university-wide discussions on sexual assault policy initiatives.
“I’m still very restless and eager to hear what our working groups come up with. I think we need to be restless, while also acknowledging the fact that we’ve done a lot of great work,” Olson said.

Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) advocated for millennials voting for the Republican party in the upcoming presidential election in a town hall-style event hosted by the Georgetown Institute for Politics and Public Service in Gaston Hall on Wednesday.
In his address, Ryan made the case for millennials to consider voting Republican by emphasizing the similarities in the beliefs of both groups.
“The America that you want is the America that we want — open, diverse, dynamic,” Ryan said. “It is what I call a confident America, where the condition of your birth does not determine the outcome of your life, where we tackle our problems together so that all of us can thrive.”
Ryan delivered an address titled “Building a Confident America” before answering questions from students sitting on stage, social media and the audience.
Attended by around 600 people, including students, faculty and staff, the event involved initial remarks by Ryan followed by a question-and-answer session moderated by GU Politics Executive Director Mo Elleithee and CNN political commentator Sarah Elizabeth “S.E.” Cupp.
McCourt School of Public Policy Dean Edward B. Montgomery and University President John J. DeGioia delivered opening remarks before GU Politics Student Advisory Board member Kayla Auletto (GRD ’16) introduced Ryan.
Ryan addressed issues such as the overregulation of small businesses, healthcare reform, poverty, prison reform and college debt in his address, and emphasized the similarity between today’s technologically driven world and a conservative view of society.
“These days, with technology, you are used to customizing your everyday life. So why on earth would you want to support a governing philosophy that seeks to take away your right and ability to customize, individualize or decide critical aspects of your life, like your health care or your education?” Ryan said. “You can’t say government is of the people when it is imposing its decisions on the people.”
Ryan said he entered politics when he was offered a job on Capitol Hill after he graduated from Miami University of Ohio because he wanted to better the country.
“I quickly realized that public service was where I could have the biggest impact. You could make a real difference in people’s lives, and at a young age,” Ryan said. “I went into politics because I wanted to solve problems.”
Ryan said his vision for a stronger America includes securing opportunities for the middle class and argued that Republicans place a stronger emphasis on the individual than do Democrats.
“We do not believe we should be governed by our betters, that elites in Washington should make all the big decisions, that they should pick winners and losers — that’s a recipe for a closed economy, for cronyism,” Ryan said. “We want an open economy, where there’s equal opportunity for all, where more people can participate and rise by their talents, where the individual can put their ideas and their aspirations to the test.”
Ryan closed his remarks with an appeal to students to participate in the political process and innovate in the private sector, saying the Republican party needs the help of the younger generation.
“Today I am asking for your help. We need your ideas,” Ryan said. “Because that’s who we are — a country that sees the potential in every human being and does everything we can to bring that potential to life.”
During the question-and-answer session that followed, Ryan responded to questions ranging from his support for the removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina State House to tax reform to the state of the 2016 presidential race.
When asked by Cupp in the question-and-answer session to make a case for millennials to trust politicians, Ryan outlined qualities he believed politicians should emulate.
“First of all, you should want to be competed with and not taken for granted. Second of all, you need to find who is a conditioned person and who is not. Who is telling you want they actually believe,” Ryan said. “You want someone who actually means what they say and says what they mean.”
Georgetown University College Republicans Vice Chair Samantha Granville (COL ’17), who sat in the audience for the event, said she appreciated Ryan’s perspective on modern conservatism.
“I thought the speaker was very engaging and relatable. He answered questions directly and was honest,” Granville said. “I think his views and outlook towards conservatism are the perfect model of where the party needs to go as a whole.”
Former GU College Republicans Chair Amber Athey (COL ’16), who sat on stage with Ryan, said she was excited to see someone she admires speak at an event on campus.
“It was an honor to share the stage with someone I’ve considered a political hero for a while now,” Athey said. “Speaker Ryan took time at the end to shake everyone’s hand on stage and it was nice to know he appreciated us being there.”
Georgetown University College Democrats President Mattie Haag (COL ’18) said though her political views differ from Ryan’s, she respected his proposals and sincerity.
“I respect him a lot as a politician and I respect him coming and having the conversation with us, especially trying to talk to young voters,” Haag said. “I think where he’s coming from and his ideas and his commitment to really finding a solution with real, policy-based solutions to the biggest problems that face us was pretty inspiring.”

The Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service launched the Baker Center for Leadership and Governance, a nonpartisan initiative focused on discourse and original research, with a town hall Tuesday, which convened leaders in politics, media, business and religion in a discussion on restoring faith in American establishment.
The Baker Center is named for its benefactors Jon M. Baker Sr. (CAS ’64) and Patricia Baker. Jon Baker, who formerly served on Georgetown’s board of regents, received the university’s highest honor, the John Carroll Award, in 1991.
According to the Baker Center website, the center aims to spur dialogue among civil society and key institutions in the public, private and academic sectors to resolve global challenges through mutual trust and policy solutions.
The center, a facet of Georgetown’s McCourt School of Public Policy, plans to host an annual Baker Forum — a gathering of government, business, nonprofit and academic leaders.
Additionally, the Baker Center intends to support and publish independent research by both members of the Georgetown community and the greater public at large as well as hold regular policy roundtables to discuss the research, according to its website.
Held at the Fisher Colloquium, the launch consisted of a panel moderated by National Public Radio host Steve Inskeep. Panelists included Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake (D), entrepreneur Sonal Shah, media expert Michelle Jaconi (SFS ’96, GRD ’97) and John Carr, the director of Georgetown’s Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life.
The conversation focused on the importance of trust in institutions, while spanning topics including tensions between police and minority communities, disappointment in the lack of fulfillment of President Barack Obama’s campaign promises and the reforms instituted by the Catholic Church following the child sex abuse scandal.
McCourt School of Public Policy Dean Edward Montgomery prefaced the town hall by emphasizing its commitment to generating conversations among different stakeholders.
“This in a nutshell is the mission of the Baker Center, one which is both global in scale and simple in its construct — to tackle some of society’s most intractable challenges, and doing so in a way that brings everyone to the table in a constructive civil discourse that helps restore some of the faith that has been lost in our core institutions,” Montgomery said.
Institute of Politics and Public Service Executive Director Mo Elleithee
(SFS ’94), who introduced the panelists, said the country is at a crossroads, now more than ever, as the public grapples with its own distrust of key institutions.
“There’s this palpable national moment we’re all in, and we see it playing out in our TV screens and our neighborhoods. No one trusts anyone,” Elleithee said.
Rawlings-Blake, who ascended to Baltimore’s mayoral office in 2010 when her predecessor Sheila Dixon resigned after being convicted of felony theft, addressed the reforms she implemented to combat the local government’s tarnished reputation.
However, she contended the specter of distrust continues to loom large over her administration, especially following the violence that ensued in response to after the death of Freddie Gray under the custody of the Baltimore Police Department in 2015 during her term as mayor.
“I can say that there has been a significant disconnect between the police force and the community for a significant number of reasons,” Rawlings-Blake said. “I think it’s easy to see it as somebody else’s problem. I think what happened with Freddie Gray made it clear to many people that what happened wasn’t just my problem, it wasn’t just the government’s problem, it was a real problem we had to address.”
As the director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life, Carr discussed the reputation of the Catholic Church and how it is still recuperating from allegations of child sexual abuse from priests, new measures to provide background checks and training procedures for the clergy have contributed to alleviating public distrust from the scandal. Still, Carr said the ascension of Pope Francis has had the largest impact on the level of public trust in the Catholic Church.
“We’ve become the poster child for betrayed trust to an eventual renewed trust, because at least at the global level we have a new leader with very different priorities who is focused on the poor and the vulnerable and not the institutions,” Carr said. “He leads by his words, by his example and by his faith.”
Jaconi, the vice president and executive editor of the Independent Journal Review, highlighted the paradoxical nature of the public’s surging distrust of the media coinciding with increased social media consumption.
“What I’m still hopeful in is that social media has an ability to show the human side of everything,” Jaconi said. “Any time you can do something to remind people who are reading or consuming your media that you are human, too, is really important.”
Inskeep explained his belief that the tension between objectivity and humanity contributes to the public’s frustrations with the media.
“So many people talk about objectivity in journalism and I don’t believe many people believe in the concept anymore,” Inskeep said. “There used to be the idea of being the voice from nowhere, just giving facts, but I have a voice, I use it, I’m not from nowhere, I’m a guy from Indiana, I’m an American, and I have certain backgrounds, and I still want to tell the truth, and I’m finding a way to tell the truth but acknowledge the fact that we’re human beings.”
The panelists reached a consensus that demographic patterns, including the growth of the minority community in the coming century and the advent of the millennial generation, will shape the public’s faith in their institutions.
Shah, who now serves as the executive director of the Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation, stressed the potential of millennials in reversing attitudes toward the American establishment.
“I don’t know if millennials are any better, but I think they have an opportunity to rewrite the world,” Shah said.
In the event’s closing remarks, Baker urged students to engage with the problem of mounting public distrust rather than depend on institutions to resolve the issue.
“The essence is that it’s important that we do something, so in that context, it’s the students, it’s the young people in the room, it’s you who have to get in the game, you have to want it, you have to commit to a difference,” Baker said. “To me, institutions are not the solution. There’s been a breakdown of institutions.”
Omar Torres (COL ’18) said he gained a renewed faith in institutions after hearing about the mission of the Baker Center.
“In the election, you hear from both sides that government is not trustworthy, that we need to make America great again or something like that,” Torres said. “But at the same time there are institutions that have the purpose of working for the people and if there’s something that I’m taking out of the discussion it’s that there’s hope in how they work and that there’s ways in which to make it more trustworthy for the people.”

Supreme Court Associate Justice Stephen Breyer argued that the court should take a more global perspective in legal deliberations and defended the responsibility of the court to uphold the rule of law in a conversation hosted by the department of government as part of the Marver H. Bernstein Symposium in Gaston Hall on Thursday.
Breyer, who has been on the Supreme Court since 1994, explained the central argument of his 2015 book, “The Court and the World: American Law and the New Global Realities,” which suggests that legal procedures in the United States should be analyzed in a global context, as U.S. legal decisions have worldwide implications and affect American interests in the long run.
After opening remarks from University President John J. DeGioia, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit Chief Judge Robert A. Katzmann introduced Breyer.
“There is no jurist who has better articulated the idea that law should work for people, no jurist more committed to making government work more effectively, no jurist today who has taken his outside activities to educate the public,” Katzmann said. “To Justice Breyer, government exists to address very human problems, and he has never lost sight of those human concerns as he examines government’s role. Law is not just about doctrine and abstract concepts. Law itself is a human institution serving the basic human and societal needs.”
Breyer said his book demonstrates the Supreme Court’s role in an interconnected world, especially given debates between national security and individual rights.
“Universality: You better interpret a statute the way other countries are going to be interpreting this,” Breyer said. “It’s got to work out in some way that you can universalize the decision. Judges in this court have to be thinking about the universality of the principle they are using in a case.”
Breyer argued that the common alternative to his perspective, that the court should remain isolated from international legal developments, is counterproductive to U.S. interests.
“I hope that, after you read this, you come to understand that the best way to preserve American values is to remain aware of what goes on outside our borders,” Breyer said. “I can’t tell someone that, but they have to come to that conclusion, and the best way to bring them to that conclusion is to show them what’s going on.”
Breyer also emphasized the unique nature of the rule of law in the United States.
“Our Constitution is power given by liberty, rather than liberty given by power. It is referring to the fact that in Europe, the power is at the center. The king might decide to give you liberty, but it’s from the center,” Breyer said. “In the United States it’s the reverse. Power lies in, ‘We the People of the United States.’ It is the people who give the power to the center. They are given. The government doesn’t have to give. That’s the power of the Constitution.”
A question-and-answer session followed Breyer and Treanor’s conversation, with questions ranging from Breyer’s stance on the religious liberty debate to the tension between national security and privacy to the power of the First Amendment.
Breyer said Supreme Court deliberations are often not about what is right or wrong, but about conflicts between permissible and protected actions.
“In general, the way these things work is the difficult cases in the SCOTUS are very rarely right versus wrong. That is to say, you have on one hand freedom of speech, and on the other hand privacy. For example, a case where somebody unlawfully takes a recording of union workers in a state that forbids that and then gives it to a newspaper, is privacy or freedom of speech violated? That’s a hard issue,” Breyer said. “Typically what happens is it depends on what the facts are of a particular case.”
Breyer also emphasized the need to protect all types of speech, including ideas the majority strongly disagrees with.
“You have to remind people that the First Amendment is not there for people you agree with and it is not there for people who you don’t agree with but you don’t really think are really awful,” Breyer said. “It’s there for the people you think are really awful. That’s why we have it. I think a university is a place that exhibits the need for this and the importance of it more than any other place.”
Grant Olson (COL ’19), who has heard Breyer speak before, said he appreciates the clarity of his arguments.
“People talk about it a lot, how he brings an accessibility to the court and an understanding,” Olson said. “I think that’s why he’s such a great jurist. He said that the first amendment is there for the people you hate, it’s there for the people you detest. It’s maybe the hallmark of our democracy and I had never thought of it that way.”

FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Admiral Michael S. Rogers emphasized the growing risk of cyberattacks and the need to better respond to them in their keynote speeches at the sixth annual International Conference on Cyber Engagement in Gaston Hall on Tuesday.
The conference, which also included a public keynote address by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), sought to promote dialogue on cybersecurity.
Comey said he was confident in the United States’ counterterrorism strategy. However, according to Comey, terrorists are susceptible to pre-emptive attacks, requiring national security departments to adjust their counterterrorism strategy.
“We have to be more predictive and less reactive as a government,” Comey said.
Comey said cybersecurity requires a collective response.
“There is no single technology, there is no single organization, there is no single entity here that has all the answers,” Comey said.
Rogers said the United States should treat cyber attacks like nuclear attacks, in that the two options for potential perpetrators are mutually assured destruction or convincing the enemy an attack would not succeed.
Comey detailed three steps necessary to help the United States combat cyberterrorism: reducing the nation’s vulnerabilities, working to eliminate as many potential threats as possible and focusing on individual threats in order to assign the best experts to each.
Comey said the government must increase its level of collaboration with the U.S. private sector in addressing cybersecurity threats. According to Comey, only 20 percent of private sector companies that are attacked reach out to the government for assistance.
Comey said the government was better equipped than individuals to identify and address instances of cyberterrorism.
“The bad guys are able to do this in their basements in their pajamas,” Comey said. “We want to get to a place where it doesn’t matter who a victim calls, it’s assigned very quickly to the right people.”
Comey said the FBI has to do a better job helping local law enforcement.
“All maters of frauds are being brought to the attention of our state and local counterparts. We have to do a better job of getting them the tools they need to catch these guys,” Comey said.
According to Comey, it is essential to impose costs on those who continue to threaten the nation’s security.
“We must make people feel our breath on the back of their neck,” Comey said.
Comey said the FBI uses a variety of tactics to prevent states and individuals from wanting to attack.
“We do this by locking up people, laying hands on people, through naming and shaming people and through economic sanctions so people understand, whether you’re a nation-state or an individual, that you can’t [hack] into the United States and steal that which is most precious to us,” Comey said.
Comey said law enforcement is working to prevent cyberattacks from succeeding in the first place.
“North Korea quite literally shut Sony down because they didn’t like the content of a movie,” Comey said. “The FBI is working very hard to get us to a place where we are not accepting intrusions as the new normal.”
Comey said it is also important to address small threats against everyday citizens by making people more technically literate.
“There are many people in this audience who have gotten an email from me from Nigeria asking you to wire me some money,” Rogers said. “Don’t do it.”
According to Comey, cybersecurity is fast becoming a tool for terrorist groups.
“Terrorists have become highly proficient at using the Internet to sell their message and to recruit and plan attacks,” Comey said. “They’re quite literally buzzing in the pockets of people to try and make them followers all around the world.”
Comey said the United States must also be aware of risks coming from within its own borders.
“They [terrorists] are using social media to target the employees of our institutions to try and engineer a way into the system,” Comey said. “And there are employees who are willing to sell their knowledge to the highest bidder — insiders with an axe to grind and with knowledge of the system.”
Rogers said it is important to consider the impacts of encryption.
“There is a collision going on between values that we all share, between privacy and security,” Rogers said. “Encryption protects us from so many bad people, but it comes at a cost. My only wish is that we talk about the cost of it.”
Rogers also offered leadership advice to undergraduate students. Rogers said it is important to look past failure and not see it as an end, but a beginning.
“You have to spend a good amount of time asking yourself, ‘What are you going to do if, despite your best efforts, you fail?” Rogers said.
Joe Dipietro (COL ’18), who attended the event, said he appreciated Rogers’ advice and looks forward to seeing what the NSA will do in the future.
“I think it’s interesting to see how the NSA is going to posture itself domestically and how it’s going to deal with foreign threats, which have been on the rise against private institutions and public institutions,” DiPietro said.

The Office of the Provost has agreed to retain 3616 N St. NW — popularly known as Brown House — as student housing following the successful #SaveBrownHouse petition, which amassed 1,057 signatures, according to the Georgetown University Student Association.
The administration removed Brown House from the housing lottery this year, drawing ire from the student body. The petition argued that the repurposing of Brown House would negatively affect undergraduates and reflected a broader deceptive university attitude toward the reassignment of townhouses.
GUSA, which sponsored the petition, plans to negotiate with the university to ensure that Brown House remains student housing for the long term, push for the renovation of existing student residence halls and advocate for more student housing rights, according to GUSA’s Facebook announcement from April 27.
GUSA originally planned to hold a March for Housing Rights on Thursday but cancelled the event because of the petition’s success.
GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff Ari Goldstein (COL ’18) said a meeting next week between GUSA and the university administration will determine which students will be assigned Brown House.
“We have a meeting with the Provost’s Office, Residential Living and Student Affairs next week to figure out how to allocate the house for the next year since the housing lottery is already complete, and everyone’s been assigned a residence,” Goldstein wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Despite the petition’s victory, Goldstein said the status of Brown House is still in doubt after the 2016-17 academic year, as the administration still wishes to repurpose it for faculty use.
“It’s an open question right now: what will happen to the house after the 2016-2017 school year,” Goldstein wrote. “I imagine they still hope to convert Brown House a year down the road after we discuss this more.”
Goldstein said GUSA is committed to lobbying the university to keep Brown House and other off-campus townhouses residential living options for students.
“GUSA’s goal is to make sure that Brown House remains in student hands for the long-term,” Goldstein said. “Our goal is also broadly to make sure that as many townhouses as possible remain in student hands for the long-term, so we’re going to have to have more detailed discussions with the provost’s office.”
Jillian Aicher (COL ’19) said he was glad Brown House was remaining as a student housing location but was frustrated by the university’s attitude toward off-campus housing.
“I think that it is a step in the right direction for the university to give us back Brown House,” Aicher said. “The fact that it was even considered is pretty upsetting.”
Sophia Griffith (COL ’19) said she believes the university singled out Brown House for its reputation as a party location but will not publicly admit its rational.
“I feel like Georgetown chose Brown House in particular; I think they know what goes on there,” Griffith said. “But for them to not say that’s the reason — it is really dubious.”

A day after he swept 118 delegates in five state primaries, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump delivered a speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday in which he delineated his foreign policy platform, including his plans to halt the growth of radical Islam and mend relations with China and Russia.
The speech, delivered at the invitation of the Center for the National Interest, a public policy think tank based in D.C., was met with criticism by Georgetown professors and students.
Trump said this mindset of re-invigorating Western values will provide the foundation for his decisions in international affairs.
“My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else. It has to be first,” Trump said. “No country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first. Both our friends and enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must do the same.”
Throughout his speech, Trump outlined five main weaknesses of current American foreign policy — the overextension of resources, failure to force allies to pay their fair share, the perceived view of allies’ lack of dependence on the United States, the lack of respect from rivals and a lost understanding of clear foreign policy goals.
“Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster,” Trump said. “No vision, no purpose, no direction, no strategy.”
According to Trump, U.S. foreign policy declined after the Cold War in a series of disastrous mistakes made in Iraq, Egypt, Libya and Syria, which fostered the development of terrorist organizations, such as the Islamic State group to grow in power.
“It all began with the dangerous idea that we could make Western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a Western Democracy,” said Trump, “We tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed. Civil war, religious fanaticism, thousands of American lives and many trillions of dollars were lost as a result.”
Trump referenced what he views as shortcomings of the Obama administration, such as America’s trade deficit, its military spending compared with other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Iran deal.
“If President Obama’s goal had been to weaken America, he could not have done a better job,” Trump said.
Throughout the rest of the speech, Trump outlined his plans to fix these problems and form a coherent foreign policy in order to pull the United States out of the nation-building business and to emphasize stability.
Government professor Matthew Kroenig said Trump’s speech lacked specificity, comparing it to speeches made by other presidential candidates such as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If this was meant to be his serious foreign policy speech, he didn’t deliver. The speech was very short on detail and if you compare this major foreign policy speech to Hillary Clinton or some of the other candidates, there’s not really anything there,” Kroenig said. “Look at his strategy for defeating ISIS — he says something about working with Muslim partners, says something about immigration, and then moves on.”
Georgetown’s Senior Associate Dean for Undergraduate Affairs Daniel Byman also said the speech reflected a lack of detail as well as containing inconsistencies.
“Trump was long on promises and criticisms, but light on specifics and solutions,” Byman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “He often tried to have it both ways, criticizing Obama and the Democrats in inconsistent ways. The speech was more scripted than previous addresses, but it dodged the hard issues.”
Government professor Andrew Bennett identified major inconsistencies in Trump’s address and criticized his campaign tactics.
“On the one hand it seems consistent with his inconsistency,” said Bennett, “He continues to say things that are not compatible with each other over time and within the same speech. The campaign is not the time to be thinking seriously about these issues, the time to think about them is the years and decades leading up to the campaign.”
Nevertheless, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) released a statement praising Trump’s vision for positioning solutions to the nation’s most pressing foreign policy issues.
“I look forward to hearing more details, but in a year where angry rhetoric has defined the presidential race on both sides of the aisle, it is my hope that candidates in both parties will begin focusing not only on the problems we face but on solutions,” Corker wrote.
Georgetown University College Republicans Membership Director Hunter Estes (SFS ’19) said the speech reinforced his fear of a Trump presidency.
“He seems to have gotten so used to the yelling and cheering that occurs at a political rally that any speech which isn’t accompanied by raucous cheers and audience interaction comes off awkward and forced,” Estes wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This speech was an overwhelmingly failed attempt to appear more presidential. However, the statements made today served to reinforce how unprepared Trump is for the highest office in our land and how little weight his words actually carry.”
Kroenig also said he is concerned about the possibility of Trump becoming president.
“If anything I think that the speech should make us even more and not less concerned about what ‘President Trump’s’ foreign policy would look like,” Kroenig said.

David Miliband, president and CEO of the global aid NGO International Rescue Committee, advocated for more responsive and collective relief efforts amid increasingly urgent humanitarian crises in a speech at Copley Formal Lounge on Wednesday.
Miliband said humanitarian efforts need to adapt to changing global crises.
“People in desperate straits around the world are not getting the help they need,” Miliband said. “The goal of humanitarian reform should be the idea of turning humanitarian action from a mission-driven but fragmented sector of activity to a high-performing and dynamic system of comprehensive work for people in humanitarian distress.”
Prior to joining the IRC, Miliband was the 74th foreign secretary for the United Kingdom.
Miliband was introduced by School of Foreign Service Dean Joel Hellman, who worked with fragile and conflict-afflicted states during his time as Director of the Center on Conflict, Security and Development for the World Bank.
Hellman said the current political climate and immigration crisis have created high demand for humanitarian efforts.
“The issue of mitigating the impacts of emergencies and disasters has created a well-known threat globally, linked to forced migration and has created an unprecedented demand for those who can mitigate the worst aspects of factors that force people out of their homes and out of their countries,” Hellman said.
Miliband said the world needs to expand beyond the existing humanitarian sector and create a humanitarian system, in order to better adapt to global crises.
“A sector is a diverse group of organizations each with a different focus operating on a set of shared principles. Think of the private sector. But a system, for example a judicial system, is directed to shared outcomes not just shared principles,” Miliband said. “A system has measure of success not just multiple measures of activity. I’d put it to you today that we have a humanitarian sector not a system.”
Miliband said the lack of defined shared outcomes undermines the effectiveness of humanitarian efforts.
“The humanitarian community has always embraced fundamental principles of independence, neutrality, impartiality and humanity. Unlike our development counterparts, we have yet to identify limited and specific results to guide programs and investments and to measure and track progress and performance,” Miliband said. “The absence of agreed-upon outcome measures prevents us from operating like a proper system.”
According to Miliband, a humanitarian aid system would address the global bureaucracy better than the current humanitarian aid structure.
“A system with clear goals, a dedicated evidence base and the right financial incentives would be better able to adapt to and anticipate change than the current sector,” Miliband said. “A system would break down the categories that currently define a lot of the policy debate.”
Miliband said one problem with the current humanitarian sector is a disconnect between its actions and purpose.
“The mandate of international institutions is based on the premise that poor people are only found in poor countries,” Miliband said. “The mismatch is not just one of resources. It’s also one of concept, institutions and mindset. There’s never been more money going to humanitarian crises but there’s never been a greater mismatch between need and the level of provision.”
According to Miliband, specific targets would help the existing institutions fulfill their goals more efficiently.
“In a way, it’s obvious, if you don’t agree what constitutes success, then the whole idea of results becomes a shimmer,” Miliband said. “In countries where needs most outpace resources, we need to agree on the most pressing changes that our shared activities are designed to achieve.”
Miliband said once goals are set, institutions should strategically allocate funds accordingly.
“If we want to sustain a system that is evolving and dynamic, we need to allocate risk capital for research and development. Crucially, funding needs to follow the evidence,” Miliband said. “Programs with high levels of impact need to grow while those without evidence need to shrink. That’s the standard we need to set for the sector.”
Miliband said humanitarian aid often fails to succeed because it does not coincide with foreign policy.
“One of the dangers for humanitarians is that we are locked outside the foreign policy box,” Miliband said. “I hear every day in my work stories of people being let down by the global community in responding to humanitarian crisis.”
According to Hellman, addressing how best to structure humanitarian efforts will become more important as problems worsen.
“There is an ever-increasing importance of the nexus between humanitarian and development issues,” Hellman said. “Because right now 15 percent of the world’s extreme poor live what we call fragile states and if we look at trends over the next 30 years, a conservative estimate of about 40 percent to a high estimate of about 70 percent.”
Zach Scherer (SFS ’18), who attended the event, said he appreciated Miliband’s approach to reforming humanitarian efforts.
“I thought he gave a really interesting perspective of not just calling for more aid. I think a lot of times that’s all humanitarian organizations do,” Scherer said. “I thought his practical approach to it was really compelling.”

Washington, D.C., Public Schools Chancellor Kaya Henderson (SFS ’92, GRD ’07) is under fire for asking a DCPS food vendor for a donation of $100,000 to the D.C. Public Education Fund two weeks after a lawsuit accused the company of swindling millions of dollars from the school system.
Messages obtained by the Associated Press under the Freedom of Information Act on April 19 revealed the interactions between the chancellor and the contractor accused of embezzling the school system of $16 million in addition to serving spoiled food to students, Chartwells-Thompson Hospitality.
In an email sent September 2013 to the Chartwells-Thompson Hospitality’s president Warren Thompson, Henderson asked for a Round of Applause donation worth $100,000 for the fund’s annual Standing Ovation for D.C. Teachers, a black-tie gala at the Kennedy Center. At the time of the emails, the contract was slated to expire.
“Warren, we’re hoping you come in at A Round of Applause, as we’d love to have a dozen of your team members able to share in celebrating the teachers they support every day,” Henderson wrote.
The solicitation netted a $25,000 donation toward the $700,000 event, raising questions about the ethical implications of the interaction. Current ethical guidelines prohibit city employees from soliciting donations from business to avoid contractors being awarded preferential treatment in exchange for donations.
DCPS Press Secretary Michelle Lerner stressed the D.C. Education Fund is a separate organization from the DCPS, saying Henderson would not have a say in renewing the food contract with Chartwells-Thompson Hospitality.
“The DC Ed Fund, which has raised more than $100 million for DC students, does its best to attract donors to the event, and the chancellor plays an important role in that,” Lerner wrote in an email to The Hoya. “However, there is a firm wall between the management of DCPS contracts and the fundraising of the DC Ed Fund. In particular, the chancellor is not involved in the selection or management of DCPS vendors.”
Chartwells-Thompson Hospitality’s Director of Communications Sara Hess defended the donations, claiming the Chancellor and DCPS posed no conflict of interest.
“We receive many requests for support of charities and other community programs, and we have supported several causes in the DC area including backpack programs, anti-bullying campaigns and the DC Public Education Fund,” Hess wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Neither the Chancellor nor DCPS had jurisdiction over the lawsuit, and it had no impact on our support of community programs.”

“In particular, the chancellor is not involved in the selection or management of DCPS vendors.”
Unfortunately this is not a true statement.  The summer before I completed my undergraduate degree (2012) I interned at DCPS in the office of Food and Nutrition Services.  They were issuing an RFP for a new food service vendor and Henderson was very involved in the process.  For example, she instructed the COO to replace two food service experts from the evaluation panel with two of her people who knew nothing about food services.  Other events were equally disturbing.  I learned a lot that summer.

University contractors will conduct a study over the next few months to determine the timeframe, price and priorities for immediate and long-term housing renovations.
Organized in conjunction with the Georgetown University Student Association, administrators and students will take representatives of architecture firm Ayers Saint-Gross and subconsultant Brailsford & Dunlavey, on tours of campus to survey dorms and receive feedback on how to maximize campus space and improve student life.
The university will use results from the study to decide how to implement renovations, while minimizing residence hall disruptions and maintaining bed capacity.
The study will consist of a data collection and programming phase expected for completion by mid-summer, and a data analysis phase to conclude in the fall.
GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said the study is an effort to define what the university needs to do to provide better housing. During negotiations for the 2018 campus plan, the first draft of which will be released by July 1, GUSA has advocated for the university to focus on deferred maintenance at the university.
“Our biggest priority right now in the context of the campus plan is housing renovations. The facilities that we have right now are abysmal and the university understands that,” Khan said. “They realize that this needs to be a priority. The housing study is important because we need an actual firm timeline and priority list in terms of what needs to be renovates first, second, third.”
According to Khan, determining housing renovations is an important part of negotiations for the campus plan.
Deputy Chief of Staff for Master Planning and Community Engagement Ari Goldstein (COL ’18) said GUSA put forward a list of priorities in the master planning process at the end of last semester, one of which was to complete ongoing renovations.
“I imagine the administration would be interested in pursuing the housing study and they received a lot of pressure from students to start being serious about renovations,” Goldstein said.
University representatives will also provide the consultants with demographics and financial data.
The Office of Residential Living and the Office of Design and Construction will take part in meetings and review documents, plans and cost estimates.
After the tours, contractors will meet with the Student Housing Working Committee and GUSA.
Consultants will then meet with focus groups of freshmen, upperclassmen, and seniors living on and off campus and residential advisors to learn about student life in particular residence halls, housing satisfaction levels, impressions of Georgetown housing options as opposed to options of other schools and why certain resident halls are valued more than others.
According to Vice President of Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey, the university recently completed a facilities condition assessment, which will inform future decisions regarding housing management.
Morey said the contractors understand Georgetown’s mission and campus structure. Brailsford & Dunlavey previously worked on renovations for Ryan and Freedom Halls.
“We are confident in their expertise and are excited to have them on the team to support the development of our housing strategies,” Morey wrote in an email to The Hoya.
GUSA Residential Living Policy Team Chair Christopher Holshouser (MSB ’18), a student representative on the working group who will work on the study during the summer, said the study would allow for more effective decision-making for both short-term and long-term renovations.
“This is going to be something that’s immediate short-term action that we can look at to see what we can fix really quickly and then longer term, more master planning type of thinking of what we can do in the next 20 to 25 years in terms of improving student life,” Holshouser said.
However, Goldstein said the length of the study is problematic because the campus plan will be signed prior to the release of study results.
“I am a little disappointed about how long it is going to take. The reality is that we’re probably going to sign a campus plan before the housing results, at which point we’ll be able to get serious about what the renovations will look like, which might present problems because we might be committing to potential new housing before we even know what renovations are going to look like,” Goldstein said.
Holshouser said GUSA will continue to play a large role in discussions regarding campus renovations to ensure that student opinion remains the main driving factor for these decisions.
“A lot of times the administration will come in with a preconceived notion that is based in good faith but not actually reflective of what students are feeling, so GUSA’s role is to make sure that the students’ needs are really being taken into consideration,” Holshouser said.

The LGBTQ Resource Center and the Tagliabue Initiative for LGBTQ Life hosted the eighth annual Lavender Graduation, which seeks to celebrate the contributions and stories of Georgetown’s graduating LGBTQ community and its allies, in the Healey Family Student Center on Wednesday.
The ceremony featured speeches from University President John J. DeGioia; keynote presenter Dinaw Mengestu (COL ’00), a novelist and writer; and student speaker Bassam Sidiki (COL ’16), followed by a reception in the HFSC Social Room for faculty, students and alumni.
The center distributed eight different awards to faculty and students, honoring 112 graduating undergraduate and graduate students for their commitment to the LGBTQ community at Georgetown. Any LGBTQ or allied student can register to participate in the ceremony.
In his speech, DeGioia said the graduating LGBTQ community has made a significant impact at Georgetown.
“Today we come together in appreciation and recognition of all that you’ve accomplished as students here at Georgetown, the contributions you’ve made, the leadership you’ve demonstrated and the service you’ve performed,” DeGioia said.
Mengestu said he saw Georgetown as a safe space where he could escape the community in which he grew up.
“I’m fairly certain I’m not the only person in this room who came to Georgetown in flight, who arrived here grateful in part for all the miles between this campus and the community I come from,” Mengestu said.
Sidiki, a Pakistani Muslim and LGBTQ advocate, emphasized the importance of including all narratives when recounting LGBTQ history. Sidiki said Lavender Graduation is a time for celebration as well as serious discussion on how the LGBTQ community can grow more inclusive of minorities.
“One point I hope people take away from my speech is the exclusion of people of color from queer narratives, especially South Asian and Middle Eastern Muslims,” Sidiki said. “People have this preconceived notion that, from what ISIS does, Islam and being gay are incompatible. I don’t feel this way.”
Sidiki said it is also necessary to be aware of the issues facing the transgender community.
“Trans people of color are actually being killed and facing violence. They can’t use the bathroom,” Sidiki said. “Those are issues that should be much more visible and salient than same-sex marriage, which is a luxury for people who have that support system.”
Sidiki praised Lavender Graduation as a unique platform for conversations about LGBTQ rights.
“As opposed to other celebrations, the speeches are geared toward what we need to do further to make a more accepting and inclusive community,” Sidiki said. “We celebrate ourselves but also talk about these issues that are hard to talk about.”
Eric Nevalsky (SFS ’16), who has worked for the LGBTQ Resource Center since his freshman year, received the Commitment to the LGBTQ Campus Community Award. According to Nevalsky, the Lavender Graduation honors students who may not have much family support on their official graduation day from the university.
“For a lot of students who are LGBTQ, we can’t have the out-and-proud moment at graduation,” Nevalsky said. “For students whose families aren’t completely accepting, this is really the space when we can come together with our friends, professors and mentors who have become our family on campus and be proud of the work we’ve done at college.”
Director of Georgetown’s theater and performance studies program Maya Roth, who received the Staff and Faculty Commitment to the LGBTQ Community Award, said supporting the LGBTQ community exemplifies Georgetown’s goals.
“There is no award that would be more meaningful to me at Georgetown,” Roth said. “To help Georgetown to manifest what is truly the best about the university is what it’s all about — not only honoring the whole person, but also pluralism and honesty, being of and in the world. This event and community mean a huge amount to me.”
Assistant Director of the LGBTQ Resource Center Julian Haas said Lavender Graduation embodies the university’s Jesuit ideals.
“Lavender Graduation is the one time of the year when, without a doubt, you get to see how much love and compassion there is on this campus for all of its students, especially those that identify as LGBT,” Haas said. “LGBTQ students and their allies are also a big part of what makes Georgetown great.”
Nevalsky said he was thankful for the event’s administrative support, which provided optimism and validation for LGBTQ students.
“For an LGBTQ student to see these high-level officials in the university saying, ‘Thank you for being here. Thank you for the work you’ve done,’ it’s really validating,” Nevalsky said.

To protect the safety of online customers in Washington, D.C., the Metropolitan Police Department announced April 21 the designation of three police stations as exchange zones where buyers of online goods can complete transactions with sellers in a safe environment under the surveillance of police officers.
The move comes after a series of robberies and murders took place across the country when buyers attempted to pick up their goods from sellers, including 57 incidents in the District since last May.
The three exchange zones are located in the lobbies of police stations across the city at 550 Water St. SW, 1620 V St. NW and 5002 Hayes St. NE.
MPD Chief Cathy Lanier said in a statement the exchange zones will provide an opportunity for those living in D.C. to have safe transactions. Lanier encouraged anyone meeting with a seller to have the transaction take place in one of the exchange areas, which are available from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily.
“The Exchange Zone will deter many of these robberies by providing well-lit areas that are near police stations, giving Washingtonians a safe place to purchase or exchange property,” Lanier said.  “The community can do their part by safely buying, selling and trading online goods at our designated locations.”
MPD Public Affairs Specialist Aquita Brown said because police have seen an increase in robberies involving marketplace apps and websites over the past few years, Lanier decided it was an appropriate time for the MPD to offer a preventative measure to reduce the amount of crime.
According to Brown, several individuals in the District have been targeted through specific marketing apps, such as OfferUp, an app made for purchasing and selling goods online.
“It started off with just a way to provide the community with a safe way to purchase items they were seeing online or whether through other mediums like OfferUp,” Brown said. “We have seen several robberies that have occurred in D.C. involving these types of apps.”
At this time, Brown said she is unsure how many citizens are expected to use the exchange zones.
Georgetown University Police Department Chief Jay Gruber said many robberies involving people buying goods off Craigslist could have been prevented by having the transaction take place in public, well-lit areas.
Gruber praised the MPD’s decision to allow transactions to take place in the lobbies of their police stations.
“There’s a lot of crime that takes place in these situations,” Gruber said. “It’s never a good idea to have somebody come into your home. Going to a public space like a mall is a better idea and even better is using the lobby of a police station.”
Gruber praised the initiative as a step in the right direction as a preventative measure to help those worried about completing an online transaction in person from websites such as Craigslist. Gruber also noted that there is always potential danger involved in meeting a stranger while carrying cash, especially at night.
“I think it’s a great idea and really a good step in the right direction,” Gruber said. “Online sales, especially through Craigslist, when you’re carrying something of value or carrying cash, there’s always a chance where the person might try to rob you and take what you have.”
Gruber also said Georgetown students should consider using these exchange zones if they have purchased goods online. He noted in the future, the GUPD might also consider the institution of measures like this in order to help students.
“I would recommend anybody, especially Georgetown students, if they’re interested in completing a transaction like that, going to one of those locations,” Gruber said. “It’s made me think that it’s something we should be doing here at Georgetown University.”
Brown noted that if a buyer of a good online decides not to use one of the exchange zones due to time or convenience, there are certain procedures that should be followed in order to ensure a safe transaction.
“We wanted to recommend some points as far as if they’re going to use other sites,” Brown said. “Go in the morning time and go with somebody you know.”

Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service is hosting a five-kilometer run in honor of Andrea Jaime (NHS ’17) — who passed away from bacterial meningitis September 2014 — and to raise funds for a new scholarship in Jaime’s name for Georgetown’s EMT class at the C&O canal Sunday morning.
Donations made in Jaime’s name will go to GERMS to establish the Andrea Jaime Award, used to fund the Georgetown EMT class for Georgetown Scholarship Program students. Jaime, who was taking the EMT class run by GERMS when she passed away, was also a member of GSP.
GERMS Crew Chief Daniela Fishbein (COL ’16) said the award will make EMS more accessible to a wider range of students, especially those in GSP.
“In general, we are always looking for more diversity in GERMS. More diversity makes anything better and GERMS is just a really big commitment to take, because it’s a volunteer job,” Fishbein said. “On top of it, the Georgetown EMT class is a lot of money and a lot of time so just taking away the financial burden for some students would maybe coax some more people into realizing how cool EMS is.”
Fishbein said he expects around 100 people to participate in the run. 146 people have RSVP’ed to the Facebook event at press time.
Idanis Perez-Alvarez (NHS ’17), Jaime’s close friend and a member of GERMS, said Jaime saw medicine as a powerful way to make a difference within the community.
“Andrea had an extreme passion for helping others through medicine,” Perez-Alvarez said.
According to Josh Tobin (COL ’18), director of public relations for the run, GERMS wants to honor Jaime’s commitment to helping others.
“Members of GERMS saw how much she devoted herself to helping other people so we wanted to emulate that with this run,” Tobin said. “I know she really enjoyed physical exercise and running so we wanted to highlight how much she enjoyed that.”
Marjia Jannati (NHS ’17), a friend of Jaime’s, said in a 2014 article in The Hoya [“Jaime Remembered for Selflesness, Passion,” The Hoya, Sept. 19, 2014] that exercise was a passion for Jaime, who regularly ran to the monuments with friends.
“Every time we got there, toward the end, I’d say, ‘I’m tired. Can we slow down and walk this part?’ For her, it was like, ‘No.’ She’d run the hardest in the last 10 minutes,” Jannati said. “I think that sums her up a little bit because she always pushed hard at the end. It didn’t matter if she was tired, she still pushed on.”
According to Tobin, while donations are highly encouraged, the team also highly values student support.
“We don’t want it to be an exclusive event because part of it is showing our solidarity with the campus,” Tobin said. “We really just want people’s support.”

Georgetown is the 44th most expensive school for off-campus living, according to the real-estate website RadPad.
RadPad, an online real estate company focused on marketing apartments to young renters, analyzed all 380 four-year universities on Princeton Review’s 2016 college ranking list to determine the schools with the most expensive rental rates for local off-campus housing.
The company used the median two-bedroom rental price within a one-mile radius of each university to determine which schools have the priciest neighborhoods for students. Stanford University took the top spot with a median rental rate of $5,165 per month. Georgetown ranked number 44 with a rate of $2,332 per month.
Nevertheless, Georgetown fell below three other universities in the District. George Washington University had the fourth-highest off-campus rates in the country at $4,100 a month, while Howard University ranked number 14 at $3,450 per month and American University, with a rate of $3,012, ranked number 20.
According to RadPad spokesperson Kyle Austin, the high ranks of other D.C. schools are likely due to their location within D.C. and their neighborhood’s supply and demand.
“A lot of it comes down to basic economics, supply and demand. For instance, while American University is further outside of downtown D.C. than Georgetown, and would appear to be in a cheaper rental area, it could potentially have a lot less rental supply in the area,” Austin wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Austin also noted the price for room and board at Georgetown for one month is $3,238, a full $900 more than the cost for a month of off-campus living at the neighborhood median. For some students, Austin argues, living off-campus can be a money-saving tactic.
The ranking comes at a time when the shape of off-campus life at Georgetown is in flux. The current Class of 2018 is the first class at Georgetown to fall under a new policy restricting them to on-campus living for at least three years of their four years on the Hilltop. Previously, students could transition to off-campus living after only two years.
Austin said he believes such a restriction limits students’ ability to enjoy their college experience the way they would like to.
“Personally I​ think every college should allow their students the option of living off-campus after the first year if they so desire. A student’s first apartment is a milestone to freedom, independence, and responsibility — a vital part to growing up,” Austin wrote.
Austin also noted some of the most intimidating aspects of arranging off-campus housing are essential building blocks to independent living.
“Dealing with a landlord and signing a lease agreement is an intimidating yet inevitable event students will face at one point in their lives. Learning about it at an early stage in college will make finding an apartment after graduation that much easier, since you’ll already have an idea of what the process entails,” Austin wrote.
Alex Potcovaru (SFS ’18), a member of the Student Advocacy Office, noted despite the benefits of off-campus living, conduct policies at Georgetown can complicate off-campus living. Off-campus students face stricter penalties for noise violations and hosting underage drinking events, as well as being held to a different standard of proof during conduction adjudication hearings.
“Because the university Code of Conduct treats off-campus students slightly more harshly, it can be more difficult for students to do some of the things that they like to do on-campus, off-campus,” Potcovaru said.
Blake Spangker (MSB ’18) said despite RadPad’s insistence of off-campus living’s superiority, he still prefers to live on campus.
“I really like the convenience of living on campus. I can roll out of bed and be at class, it’s easier for me to grab something from my room if I forget it. Plus it’s really close to Leo’s,” Spangler said.

Washington, D.C. will celebrate the fifth annual International Jazz Day with a program of jazz performances and educational initiatives April 30 as this year’s Global Host City. Georgetown University also plans to host a series of events in order to commemorate the day.
Officially declared a holiday by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 2011, International Jazz Day is a culmination of April’s Jazz Appreciation Month, which seeks to promote intercultural dialogue about jazz’s role in stimulating world peace.
Programming in the District will feature a wide array of entertainment, including a concert from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. on DuPont Circle, a panel discussion about women and jazz at the National Museum of Women in the Arts and posthumous tributes to jazz legend and D.C. native Duke Ellington across the city.
The White House will further host the International Jazz Day All-Star Global Concert on April 29 spotlighting artists such as Herbie Hancock, Esperanza Spalding, Aretha Franklin and Sting.
Though International Jazz Day is recognized in 190 countries around the world, UNESCO’s Director General Irina Bokova said in a statement that UNESCO selected D.C. as the Global Host City due to jazz’s distinct American heritage.
“Jazz was born in the U.S. and traveled the world as a music of tolerance, freedom and human dignity. This is why UNESCO created International Jazz Day, and we are extremely pleased that in 2016 Washington, D.C. has been designated the host city for this global celebration,” Bokova said. “This event reminds us Jazz is more than music: it is a universal message of peace with rhythm and meaning.”
Georgetown University will celebrate with its own Jazzfest from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. on April 30 on Copley Lawn with performances by the Annandale Jazz Ambassadors from Virginia Music Adventures, David Kline Band, Afro Bop Alliance and Georgetown University Jazz Ensemble.
GU Jazz Ensemble instructor and music professor Aaron Broadus lauded the burgeoning jazz community presence on campus.
“It is a small culture, but it is a very good culture. I am fortunate that I have a very dedicated group of young musicians that really enjoy the music and spend a lot of time during the semester working with different styles of music that I give them,” Broadus said.
GU Jazz Ensemble musician Andrew Kirkpatrick (COL ’18) agreed, although the university’s jazz community is rather understated, he still finds a vibrant base of devotees on campus.
“Jazz band exists, and we are very good. There is not really a jazz culture here, pretty much the people in jazz band are the ones who do it, but it is really fun to listen to, and it is enjoyable,” Kirkpatrick said. “Generally I am excited about Saturday. I love jazz, and I think it is one of the coolest things ever. I love playing, so I am excited that there is a lot of jazz stuff going on.”
Dipali Gupta (MSB ’17) commended Georgetown’s commitment to celebrating jazz as an art form.
“I think music at Georgetown is great,” Gupta said. “It’s one of the things that is underplayed here. It is one of the hidden treasures we have at Georgetown for sure.”
