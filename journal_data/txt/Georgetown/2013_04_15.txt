At least two people have died and 64 left injured after two explosions occurred at the Boston Marathon this afternoon.
The explosions were the result of bombs that detonated near the marathon’s finish line around five hours after the race began, and police evacuated the area due to a possible bomb inside the Prudential Center. Bomb squads also destroyed two other devices.
Boston police are urging people to stay home, and cell phone service to the city has reportedly been shut down to prevent any remote detonation, according to a law enforcement official. However, Verizon and Sprint representatives have said that their services are still operating normally.
A fire at the JFK Library was initially thought to be related to the bombings, but several media outlets have since confirmed that the incidents are not linked.
In Washington, D.C., the portion of Pennsylvania Avenue outside of the White House has been closed off to the public as a safety precaution. Officials conducted the same procedure during the Oklahoma City bombings in 1995. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority is also stationing additional officers in Metro stations during rush hour.
