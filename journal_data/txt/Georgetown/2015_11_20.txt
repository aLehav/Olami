Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) delivered this election season’s first candidate address in Gaston Hall yesterday, where he defined democratic socialism as economic security for the middle class and called for collaborative efforts to destroy the Islamic State group.
The speech marked a defining moment in Sanders’ campaign, as the self-proclaimed democratic socialist directly outlined his foreign policy strategy in response to last week’s terrorist attacks in Paris, Beirut and Baghdad, allegedly orchestrated by the Islamic State group.
Sanders called on students to take part in his grassroots movement to restructure the country’s economic system and alleviate income inequality.
“We need to develop a political movement, which is prepared to take on and defeat a ruling class whose greed is destroying our nation,” Sanders said.
The Georgetown Institute for Politics and Public Service organized Sanders’ visit. The group sent invitations to all presidential candidates during the summer. According to IPPS Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94), Sanders is the first to accept the invitation.
With Gaston Hall filled to maximum capacity, Sanders walked onstage to a standing ovation and a “Feel the Bern” chant. Georgetown is prohibited from endorsing public office candidates due to its status as a tax-exempt organization, and attendees were not allowed to bring campaign signage into the hall.

Sanders began by acknowledging the need for change in the country’s political processes.
“We have an economic and political crisis in this country, and the same old politics and economics will not effectively address those crises,” Sanders said.
Sanders argued that democratic socialism will bring about positive change to the working class.
“Democratic socialism means that we must reform a political system which is corrupt, that we must create an economy that works for all, not just the very wealthy,” Sanders said.
Throughout his speech, Sanders cited direct quotations from Franklin D. Roosevelt, Martin Luther King Jr. and Pope Francis to highlight the importance of socialist ideas throughout history.
“Real freedom must include economic security. That was Roosevelt’s vision 70 years ago. It is my vision today. It is a vision that we have not yet achieved and it is time that we did,” Sanders said.
Sanders also noted that many other countries, including Denmark, Canada and Taiwan, employ democratic socialist models.
“I hope all of you know this is not a radical idea. It is a conservative idea. It is an idea and a practice that exists in every other major country on earth,” Sanders said.
In addition to presenting his platform for the economy, Sanders shed light on his stance on social issues, including his support for open immigration policies and his critiques of the fossil fuel industry and mass incarceration.
In a comment that drew the afternoon’s loudest applause, Sanders expressed his support for the Black Lives Matter movement.
“I do believe in equal treatment for African-Americans, who are right to proclaim the moral principle that black lives matter,” Sanders said.
Shifting to foreign policy, Sanders warned against repeating failed policies of the Bush administration and that military action should be authorized with caution.
“Our response must begin with an understanding of past mistakes and missteps in our previous approaches to foreign policy,” Sanders said. “Unilateral military options should be a last resort, not a first report.”
Sanders suggested that the United States should play a facilitative role in the fight against the Islamic State group.
“While the U.S. and other Western nations have the strength of our militaries, the fight against ISIS is a struggle for the soul of Islam, and countering violent extremism and destroying ISIS must be done primarily by Muslim nations with strong support of their global partners,” Sanders said.
In a question-and-answer session following the address, Sanders clarified his views on democratic socialism and intervention in the Middle East. Sanders also argued that the United States should open its borders to refugees. The questions were submitted by students prior to the event, and were asked by Elleithee onstage.
“I’m not happy about hearing that we should close our borders to men, women and children who have been displaced because of terrorism,” Sanders said. “We should accept refugees from [Syria]. That’s the moral thing to do. Accepting refugees is what America has always done, and I think it’s improper to turn our backs on them now.”
The event has been widely anticipated since the IPPS announced it Wednesday morning in a university-wide email. Elleithee said the IPPS was excited to host Sanders as its first presidential candidate guest.
“Bernie Sanders has been saying for weeks that he wanted to give a speech discussing his political worldview and democratic socialism in America. We completely agree with him. Georgetown is the perfect place to give it,” Elleithee wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Students began lining up outside Gaston Hall at 6 a.m., with the queue stretching out to the front gates by the time doors opened. The rainy weather did little to deter students from waiting outside Healy Hall. Many students were turned away after the seats were filled.
Alan Chen (COL ’18), an attendee, said that although he does not agree with Sanders’ political views, he appreciated his efforts in engaging student voters.
“Personally, I don’t agree with him on many of the political issues, but I think that he is the most willing out of any of the candidates to be engaged with young people like us and college-aged voters, and I think that’s very encouraging for the political process,” Chen said.
Erin Leonard (SFS ’16), a coordinator of the student group Georgetown for Bernie, said she was impressed by Sanders’ performance. Members of the group and the College Democrats met with Sanders after the event.
“It was amazing getting to see Bernie today, and feel how much energy was in the room,” Leonard wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I think he summarized his platform really well and I was really glad that he talked about his stance on foreign policy, because that’s definitely on everyone’s mind right now.”
Democratic Socialists of America Deputy Director David Duhalde, an attendee, said democratic socialist views are particularly appealing to younger generations. The DSA, a national political organization, also operates a student wing, Young Democratic Socialists, which has previously hosted chapters at Georgetown.
“We’ve seen a surge in support, partly because of Bernie, and because our generation of millennials, who have been the most hurt by the recession and the aftershocks, are also the most open to democratic socialist politics and change,” Duhalde said.
Jules Bernstein, an employment attorney who attended the speech, said the event’s turnout is a testament to Sanders’ growing popularity.
“It demonstrates that young people are very interested in hearing from Bernie, what he has to say, and he has some very important things to say,” Bernstein said. “The fact that there are probably over 1,000 people here who wanted to hear him is very gratifying. They want change.”

Athletes and Advocates for Worker’s Rights, a working group composed of athletes from multiple sports teams and student advocates, delivered a letter to University President John J. DeGioia’s office outlining its opposition to Nike’s unethical business practices and urging the university to cut ties with the company yesterday morning.
The group, which formed last week following a discussion on campus with sweatshop activist Jim Keady, argues that the athletics department should suspend its partnership with Nike. Twenty students-athletes and advocates signed the letter on behalf of the university’s student-athletes.
“Today we come to you with tape over the Nike logos of our Georgetown athletic apparel and Georgetown bookstore apparel because we refuse to be associated with a brand that is in direct opposition to Georgetown’s core values,” the letter reads.
AAWR stirred controversy last week after Keady posted a photo on Facebook that showed the Nike logo covered with tape on the university-provided shoes of three student-athletes.
The group cited the poor working and living conditions at Nike’s factories in Asia as its primary concern. After the event last week, several athletes teamed up with student advocates on campus, including Wearable Justice CEO and founder Jake Maxmin (COL ’17). The athletes requested anonymity, citing potential pushback from the athletics department.
In the letter, AAWR also highlighted the recent decision by Nike to refuse the Worker Rights Consortium — an international labor rights monitoring organization — access to its factories in Southeast Asia. According to the Office of Public Affairs website, Georgetown is a founding affiliate of the consortium, which serves to enforce manufacturing codes of conduct adopted by all affiliate colleges. As stated by the AAWR, Nike’s refusal directly puts Georgetown in violation of its WRC commitment.
“Being a current affiliate of the WRC means we require all brands that produce Georgetown apparel to disclose where their factories are and the conditions under which workers are producing apparel,” the letter reads. “Nike should not be an exception.”
According to Office of the President Chief of Staff Joe Ferrera, DeGioia has received the letter. Business Policy and Planning Director Cal Watson said that student concerns will be heard and considered by university officials.
“Students at Georgetown have a long history of engaging on the important issue of workers’ rights in the collegiate apparel industry,” Watson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “During its monthly meeting today, Georgetown’s Licensing Oversight Committee discussed the concerns about Nike that have been raised by some of our students. We are gathering more information and will continue to work with everyone involved.”
The athletics department has not issued a statement.
Maxmin said the decision to take a stand against Nike is an important way to raise awareness on the issue of workers’ rights and the need for ethically sourced apparel.
“We don’t want this just to be seen as athletes pressuring other athletes to boycott Nike,” Maxmin said. “We are students and athletes shedding light and raising consciousness about an issue on campus that we think is important, and that we think people should know about.”
An anonymous student-athlete said the letter serves as an effective way to inform the student body of AAWS’ mission.
“The reason that we released this letter is because we want the students at Georgetown to know what’s going on and to make their own decision,” the student-athlete said.
The anonymous student-athlete also said the movement is part of a larger development at universities across the country. AAWS has collaborated with United Students Against Sweatshops to create a day of action Thursday, in which groups across the country advocated for the cause.
“This isn’t just Georgetown. This is schools all over the U.S. that are concerned about this issue, and 40 schools dropped letters to their administration on Thursday to make their campus and their administration aware,” the student-athlete said.
Maxmin said that the letter is a result of a larger consensus of the student body and not restricted to a particular group of students.
“This letter is not representative of one single person, student or athlete’s point of view. This is a collective viewpoint of a larger group, a larger movement,” Maxmin said.
Maxmin also said further dialogue on the movement will occur Dec. 1 in a town hall, potentially featuring Office of Federal Relations Associate Vice President Scott Fleming, who also serves on the university Licensing and Oversight Committee and as a board member of the WRC.
Students in the AAWS stress that this movement comes from a desire to make sure Georgetown upholds its Jesuit values in all avenues of administration.
“As a Jesuit University, we educate ‘men and women for others,’ which means we must act when we see injustice,” the letter reads. “We love Georgetown, we believe in Georgetown and that is why we are asking this.”

One year after the passage of Initiative 71, a ballot measure that legalized the possession, growth and use of marijuana in the District of Columbia, marijuana-related crimes are down 99.2 percent from last year.
Nov. 4 marked the first anniversary of the legislation that allows individuals over the age of 21 to possess and transport two ounces or fewer of marijuana and grow up to six marijuana plants at one time within the interior of their principal residence. However, they cannot keep more than three mature marijuana plants at a single time. Smoking in public is still illegal, as is smoking on federal land.
According to the Metropolitan Police Department, there have been seven arrests for marijuana-related crimes as of Nov. 6, down 99.2 percent from 2014’s 895 arrests. The data indicate a sharp decrease in marijuana arrests in the five years since 2010, with 2,161 arrests in 2010, 2,346 in 2011, 1,553 in 2012 and 1,215 in 2013.
MPD Chief Cathy Lanier emphasized the strong public support for legalizing marijuana and its positive impact.
“Seventy percent of the public supported [Initiative 71],” Lanier said in a February 2015 interview with The Daily Beast after the initiative was officially implemented. “All those arrests do is make people hate us.”
Georgetown University Police Department Chief Jay Gruber discussed the positive effects of the new law on police department strategies in general.
“Because of the law, we’ll probably be arresting less people. And as a result, the criminal justice system won’t be as backlogged,” Gruber said. “Another way to look at it from a police perspective, we won’t be spending as much time processing criminals. In general, a lot of police departments spend a lot of time arresting people for small amounts of marijuana.”
Gruber stressed that Initiative 71 responded to the will of the people, with the legalization of marijuana reflecting what the public thought to be a fair policy.
“I think people don’t like it when the police enforce laws that people feel are unfair. It’s obvious that the residents of the District of Columbia thought that this law was unfair,” Gruber said.
According to McCourt School of Public Policy professor Mark Rom, marijuana culture in D.C. has not seen drastic changes since the introduction of Initiative 71.
“Are more people using pot now that it’s legalized? I’m guessing probably not,” Rom said.
Rom compared the current ban on drinking in public to the former ban on marijuana smoking and discussed how race also affects both drinking and marijuana use in public.
“Let me note that drinking in public is also illegal, but … the National Symphony plays at the Capitol on the west front of the Capitol, on the Fourth of July, Memorial Day, Labor Day. If you’re a white person down there with a picnic blanket and a couple bottles of wine, you will never be hassled by the police,” Rom said. “So that is a case where I’m thinking I’m really glad that those who are not as old and affluent and white can also live their lives without being hassled and arrested by the police.”
Despite broader legalization in D.C., marijuana is still banned on Georgetown’s campus, a policy Gruber maintained is necessary for the university.
“The university receives federal funding, marijuana is still considered criminal under federal law, so we still have to enforce the marijuana laws on campus,” Gruber said. “Although we can no longer arrest for small amounts, we still do refer students to student conduct.”
Gina Kim (SFS ’18) said the school has a right to regulate marijuana on campus, although she is in favor of legalization in the District.
“Because marijuana is legal in D.C., I think that regulation of it should be similar to alcohol,” Kim said. “There are places on campus that are dry and alcohol is not allowed in these places but it is allowed in others. This is the way I think marijuana should be.”
Rom had a somewhat different take on why he felt that marijuana should be banned on campus.
“I think that Georgetown should still have a no-pot-smoking policy on campus. … I don’t want it to be enforced with draconian stringency, but I think our student population is better off the less we drink, the less we smoke,” Rom said. “I like pot. … So, you know, count me in the personal pro-pot-using community. Nonetheless, I don’t think it’s a good thing for us, by and large.”
Outside of the District of Columbia, marijuana is now legal in 20 states, including Colorado and Oregon.

Scott Dikkers, founding editor and former editor-in-chief of The Onion, called on students to follow their passions by recounting his experiences founding the satirical publication in the Intercultural Center Auditorium on Monday.
The Georgetown University Student Association and the Lecture Fund collaborated to bring Dikkers to campus. More than 300 people attended the event, which was titled “The Funny Story Behind the Funny Stories.”
Dikkers encouraged students to choose careers based on their passions.
“Live your mission. Don’t worry about the money; just do what you love, obsessively and without hesitation,” Dikkers said. “You don’t want to work hard, you don’t want to work smart, you want to work right.”
Dikkers said that his journey toward comedy came as a result of a bleak childhood, which included a suicide attempt in the third grade and his parents’ divorce in middle school.
“I learned that if you made the bullies laugh, they wouldn’t beat you up. So I learned to write funny and draw funny,” Dikkers said. “The main thing I learned in school was that humor was a coping mechanism for just about anything life throws at you.”
Dikkers said he began to see his interest in comedy as a potential career when a comic strip he wrote for a local high school paper won first place in a Wisconsin state journalism contest. Shortly after, he sent comic strips to news syndicates every week for years until The Daily Cardinal, the newspaper of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, turned one of his strips into the daily comic “Jim’s Journal.”
Eventually, the comic ran in around 100 college papers and Dikkers self-published the series in a book that made national best-sellers lists. “Jim’s Journal” caught the attention of two college students with the idea to start a humor magazine — The Onion — at UW-Madison.
According to Dikker, the working title for the publication was originally The Rag, but the group settled on The Onion.
“The Onion seemed like a great name for a newspaper. You peel back the layers to get at the facts. I don’t understand why it’s not in the acceptable pantheon of newspaper names like ‘The Herald’ or ‘The Beacon’. Of course we’ve ruined it now for everyone,” Dikkers said.
Dikker said that one of The Onion’s strongest features is its unique staff.
“Most of our writers were at some point on prescription drugs and came from broken homes. Our head writer for many years was clinically depressed, actually suicidal. … We hired an agoraphobic, a pathological liar and a conspiracy nut,” Dikkers said. “These were our A-players. They were smart, they were bitter and they had no prospects in life, so they appreciated the soapbox.”
Dikker recalled that these writers, coupled with The Onion’s brand of humor, garnered controversy for the publication.
“We got a lot of calls. We got one from the Taco Bell Corporation at one point because they did not at all like our story ‘Taco Bell Unveils New “Morning-After” Burrito,’” Dikkers said.
In the mid-2000s, The Onion launched The Onion News Network, an original online video content platform.
“When we started the new video arm, we started to have a lot of the same problems we had when we started the paper. People kept calling us angry, because they were confused and thought it was real news,” Dikkers said. “We had exposed ourselves to a whole other demographic of people who don’t read and only watch their news.”
According to GUSA President Joe Luther (COL ’16), who worked with the Lecture Fund to invite Dikkers to campus, the event comes as the result of a long planning process. Luther is the former editor-in-chief of the satirical publication The Georgetown Heckler.
“This is something we’ve been kicking around since February. We talked with The Onion about sending actual writers but … we made the judgment call that the perspective would be more helpful and have a broader appeal if it was the founder of the publication,” Luther said.
Luther said he particularly resonated with Dikkers’ comments on following one’s passions.
“I liked his emphasis that it’s not how much you’re making or materially how well you’re doing, it’s just about if you’re pursuing what you love. It was really great to hear that as long as you’re doing what you love, you could be happy,” Luther said.
Sam Matta (COL ’19), an attendee, said Dikkers’ remarks were both humorous and informative.
“He did a good balance of making it funny, but he spoke a lot about entrepreneurship and the work that it takes to actually be a comedy writer, which was really interesting,” Matta said.
Luther agreed that Dikkers’ talk was useful, especially to those looking to learn more about comedy.
“I think he imparted a lot of wisdom and knowledge to the crowd. I was blown away to see so many people there interested in satire and its effects on society … and I really, really hope he hires me someday,” Luther said.

A policy scorecard released earlier this month outlined potential concerns with the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department’s body-worn camera program, including disagreements about officer access to the footage.
In September, the Department of Justice awarded $1 million to support the expansion of the city’s body camera program, which is set to equip 2,800 police officers who regularly interact with the public with cameras. The grant builds on President Barack Obama’s proposal to provide 50,000 more body cameras for law enforcement agencies nationwide in the next three years.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser also sent a proposal to the D.C. Council for review that would limit the public’s ability to view the footage from police body-worn cameras.
The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a lobbying coalition of more than 200 national organizations, and Upturn, a D.C.-based technology and policy consulting firm, studied 49 cities for the scorecard. Criteria included officer discretion, personal privacy, officer review, biometric use and footage retention, misuse and access.
This scorecard coincides with the American Civil Liberties Union’s release of the Mobile Justice app, which allows citizens to record police encounters and submit a case-intake form within the app.
The police departments received a green check mark if their policy fully satisfied the criteria, a yellow circle if the policy partially satisfied the criteria and a red cross if the policy did not address the issue or ran directly against their principles.
The MPD received three red crosses in the categories of officers’ ability to review the footage before writing their reports on the incidents, requirements for footage retention and the use of biometric footage searching.
Of the 25 police departments studied, none received green check marks across the board. One department, belonging to Ferguson, Mo., received all red crosses.
According to Upturn Principal Harlan Yu, the purpose of the scorecard is to allow various departments to compare their policies to other departments in order to improve.
“One of the main reasons why we made this scorecard was because policies around body-worn cameras are all over the place across the country. The purpose of this scorecard that we released was to examine and evaluate these details of what these policies are,” Yu said. “The whole purpose of this is to help police departments improve their policies over time, to look at their peer departments and to see where other departments are doing well and where other departments might be lacking.”
Yu raised specific issues within MPD’s body-worn camera program, such as the ability of officers to review footage before filing their initial incident reports and the use of biometric footage searching.
Yu said if an officer views the footage before writing a report, they have the opportunity to claim more credibility than other witnesses.
“The concern here is that if officers are allowed to view the footage before writing a statement, the officer’s statement will always appear more accurate and more credible than other witness statements,” Yu said. “Other witnesses don’t have the benefit of being able to watch the footage and then give a statement to investigators or in a court of law. If officers are allowed to view the footage, this creates an uneven playing field.”
MPD declined to comment on the issues brought up by the policy scorecard.
However, a district official from the mayor’s office, who declined to be named out of concern about job safety, maintained that being able to view the footage has allowed for more accurate incident reports.
“In the officer incident report, it should reflect all the facts available to the officer and that would include what the officer’s own recollection of the event was, any notes that the officer took and, obviously, the body camera footage,” the district official said. “So when the officer goes back to write up the incident report, that report would reflect all the information that’s out there and available to the officer about what occurred.”
Bowser’s office also emphasized that her proposal attempts to balance the issues of transparency and individual privacy by amending the Freedom of Information Act to prohibit certain footage from being released to the public.
The district official from the mayor’s office stressed that this amendment would protect the privacy of victims of crimes such as domestic abuse, sexual assault and various similar crimes.
“The concern is that because those types of crimes are so personal, we don’t want to do anything to dissuade future victims from coming forward out of fear that their interactions with officers could be released on the evening news,” the district official said. “That’s our proposal on how to ensure the privacy of those victims of highly personal crimes.”
Yu proposed a two-step process in which the officer would write an initial report without viewing the footage and then a second report after viewing the footage. Yu said that he did not see the problem with requiring officers to write two reports.
“I don’t think that this necessarily precludes the process where an officer initially needs to provide an independent account of what he or she remembers,” Yu said. “These things are not mutually exclusive. We can get both.”
Yu also explained that MPD did not have a policy in place to limit the use of biometric searching, such as facial recognition, for footage. Yu contended that biometric searching obstructs various civil liberties, pointing out that officers could simply walk by a crowd and identify individuals automatically, including individuals with warrants or previous arrests.
“I think this creates problems for freedom of association and ultimately, freedom of speech,” Yu said.
Yu pointed to the Baltimore Police Department’s stringent restrictions on biometric searching as a model for other departments. Baltimore was the only department awarded a green check mark in this category.
Georgetown University Police Department Chief Jay Gruber said he believes body-worn camera footage will serve as evidence that officers, in general, act commendably, although GUPD does not have access to this program.
“I think the programs will show that law enforcement officers generally do an excellent job, have great decision-making under pressure. I think that they’re given a bad rep because a lot of the people that they’re dealing with are anti-police,” Gruber said. “They don’t want to be arrested, they’re criminals and for those people that don’t fit that, the general public, police officers present a very professional attitude.”
Gruber added that there were exceptions to the overall professionalism of police officers and he hopes that body-worn cameras will bring these exceptions to light.

Charles Cawley (CAS ’62), whose donations to the university led to the construction of the Davis Performing Arts Center in 2005 and the Cawley Career Education Center in 1994, died at the age of 75 at his home in Camden, Maine, Wednesday morning.
The cause of death has yet to be disclosed.
The donations by Cawley and the MBNA Corporation funded the construction of the career center in 1994.
The donations also funded the adjacent Sellinger Lounge, named for Cawley’s mentor and former Georgetown College Dean Rev. Joseph Sellinger, S.J.
The career center, which originally had an unspecified name, was renamed after Cawley in 2012. It is currently housed in Leavey Center.
Cawley was also instrumental in the continued funding of the Baker Scholars Program, an undergraduate initiative to cultivate socially conscious business leaders.
Cawley also established the 1111 Cawley/Murphy GU Scholarship in memory of his nephew.
The scholarship is awarded to undergraduates from Delaware, Maine, Maryland or New Jersey who demonstrate financial need.
Cawley founded the MBNA Corporation in 1982 and served as its CEO from 1982 to 2003.
The company grew into the world’s largest credit card issuer before Bank of America bought the company for $35 billion in 2006.
Cawley spearheaded the affinity lending industry, recruiting organizations such as universities, sports teams and charities to sponsor credit cards backed by the company.
Cawley and MBNA are also credited with reviving downtown Wilmington, Del., after opening their headquarters there in 1995.
Georgetown honored Cawley first with the John Carroll Award in 1998, then again with the Wall Street Alliance Award in 2002 for his service to the university.
Cawley is survived by his wife Julie and their two children C. Michael Cawley (CAS ’86) and Maureen Cawley Rhodes (CAS ’88).
A full obituary will be published on thehoya.com.
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Mr. Cawley died in his home in Camden, Minn. Mr. Cawley died in his home in Camden, Maine.

The Lecture Fund recently restructured its organization to include a general body membership, which met for the first time in Healy Hall last Wednesday.
This marks the first time that the nonpartisan, student group has created an open forum to collaborate with students and discuss initiatives to improve campus dialogue.
General body members will also provide assistance to individual students who wish to organize speaker events without the help of a student group and address event accommodations for students with disabilities.
According to Lecture Fund Co-Vice Chair Hayden Jeong (MSB ’17), the Lecture Fund has been working on establishing the general body membership to gather student feedback for several semesters.
“Catering to what the Georgetown students want is going to help us host more effective events in the future,” Jeong said.
Jeong also said that the Lecture Fund hopes to gain student perspectives on how to constructively contribute to campus activism and promote free speech.
With the new structure, organizations interested in bringing a speaker to campus can have the event co-sponsored by the Lecture Fund, which will provide financial, logistical and marketing support.
The group will continue to host an active calendar of speakers addressing a range of subjects and disciplines.
During the event Wednesday, students called for members of the Black Lives Matter movement to come to campus and address racial tensions in the United States. Others suggested inviting political experts to speak about the current presidential election. The event was attended by 10 students.
At one point, Lecture Fund Co-Vice Chair D.J. Angelini (MSB ’17) asked the students to suggest the one individual that they would most like to see at an event in Georgetown. Responses included Stephen Colbert, Bill Nye and Samantha Power.
The Lecture Fund has hosted five speakers throughout the semester, ranging from Kiran Ghand, former drummer for English hip-hop artist M.I.A., to Garry Kasparov, former world chess champion. The group will host two more speakers before the end of the semester.
The forum also served as an opportunity for the Lecture Fund to gauge students’ stances on certain issues and adjust their programming based on student perspectives.
According to Jeong, the organization hopes to hold more regular general membership meetings in the future and make them a consistent part of its effort to ensure that the Lecture Fund is as receptive as possible to the student body.
Jeong said she hopes to host another meeting before the end of the fall semester and conduct monthly meetings upon returning in the spring.
“Whether you come to three in a row or if you stop by every now and then, we would love to see familiar faces,” Jeong said. “[We also want] to speak with students who haven’t interacted with us before.”
Jeong said that she hopes the forum will dispel some preconceived notions about the exclusivity of the Lecture Fund and highlight the organization’s genuine interest in the opinions of the student body.
“We definitely want students to see that some of the stereotypes that they might have aren’t necessarily true,” Jeong said. “Sometimes students think all we do is stand in line and usher people into Gaston. “We do a lot more than that and we want [students] to know the full range of our services. We want them to tell us what they want from us.”
Alexander Mooney (MSB ’19), who attended the meeting, said that the event was a great way for potential members of the group to learn about the organization and how to contribute to shaping campus dialogue.
“Lecture Fund is all about inspiring dialogue. … So having a general membership meeting for selective clubs like this is a really helpful way to know who would actually be committed to the club and involve the student body,” Mooney said.
Grant Olson (COL ’19), who also attended the meeting, said that it is important for students to draw on a diverse assortment of speakers.
“You know you can aim high for the big names,” Olson said. “But you can aim for the niche names that people might not really know, but can enlighten a section of the student body that really makes a difference.”

“There is nothing that I am prouder of,” Georgetown University Medical Center professor Aviad Haramati said with a smile, recalling his role in the founding of the Mind-Body Medicine Program 13 years ago.
The program, built around a series of courses in GUMC, teaches self-care strategies of stress relief and mindfulness to help students navigate their academic challenges and maintain a lifelong sense of well-being.
In recent years, the program has expanded significantly. It formed in 2002 with with a five-year grant of $1.7 million grant the National Institutes of Health’s former National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Initially, it was offered through the Complementary and Alternative Medicine Masters Program in Physiology before spreading to the School of Nursing and Health Studies in 2007, the Georgetown University Law Center in 2008 and the School of Foreign Service in 2011.
Haramati felt that the stress culture at Georgetown required an educational response.
“We wanted … to see if we could help students become self aware, manage stress, learn about themselves and about each other and foster a community that was more empathic,” Haramati said. “That was our goal.”
Faculty members volunteer to become certified by the School of Medicine to teach the course and receive no payment for their teaching.
Associate SFS Dean Anthony Pirrotti, who teaches an undergraduate mind-body medicine class, said faculty members benefit alongside their students.
“The people who lead the classes really enjoy doing it,” Pirrotti said. “I also think that we all feel like we learn something each week too and that’s what we get out of it.”
The program left the NHS in 2010, but any undergraduate student can enroll in a one-credit course called “Intro to Mind-Body Connection.” The course, typically capped at 10 students per section and graded on a pass or fail basis, introduces students to various types of meditation.
Techniques taught include breath meditation, guided imagery, journal writing and art exercises.
Founder and Program Director Nancy Harazduk said the mindfulness meditation skills imparted in the course could help students to cope with stress.
“[Mindfulness meditation is] focusing on one specific thing intentionally and non-judgmentally in the present moment,” Harazduk said. “One of the main reasons that we’re stressed is we regret the past, or we worry about the future, but if we can let that go, and stay in the present, the stress is lessened.”
According to Harazduk, students in the program form close bonds with the other members of their groups.
“They share things that are true to their souls with others so they become intimately connected,” Harazduk said. “They help each other, and I think that a vital part of the group is connecting with other people.”
Students who took the course in the School of Medicine echoed this sentiment.
“I can’t possibly express in words how beneficial [being in a group] is,” Sadie Canter (MED ’18) said. “It helps you to put things in perspective.”
Kevin Diasti (MED ’18) said that the mindfulness emphasized in the program could be beneficial for anyone.
“I think a good attention to centeredness to yourself, to the person that you are, for your mental health, is integral for everyone in our society,” Diasti said.
According to a 2015 survey by the American College Health Association, 86.7 percent of college students reported feeling overwhelmed within the past 12 months.
While Georgetown’s student stress data is kept confidential, Health Education Services Director Carol Day said Georgetown students report levels of stress that mirror national trends.
“There is a stress culture, and students tend to glorify being busy, which means they’re filling their lives with all kinds of things,” Day said. “I think that doing too much is the norm.”
Harazduk said the program aims to address this problem.
“It’s one way to help the students and the faculty reduce their stress and reduce their burnout,” Harazduk said.
In a recent student stress survey conducted by Reza Baghaee-Rezaee (NHS ’18), Emily Ko (NHS ’18) and Tracy Acheampong (NHS ’18), 167 subjects reported an average stress level of five out of 10 without pending exams and a stress level of eight with pending exams.
At the end of the survey, students were asked to comment on the stress culture at Georgetown.
“The stress atmosphere here is toxic,” one student wrote.
Kayleigh Hauri (COL ’16), who enrolled in the undergraduate mind-body medicine course last semester, said the pressure to succeed at Georgetown sometimes causes students to neglect their mental and physical health.
“I think that people push themselves really hard because they want to do well, but at the cost of their mental health or their own health in general,” Hauri said.
Director of Georgetown’s Counseling and Psychiatric Service Philip Meilman said mindfulness can help students cope in the face of stress.
“The typical Georgetown student is highly talented and achievement-oriented. Sometimes, however, one can be so active that self care falls by the wayside,” Meilman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Mindfulness and meditation enable a student to push the ‘pause’ button and do something very supportive of one’s own health and well-being.”
Pirrotti said he hopes that the program will expand further and continue to meet student demand.
“I think that there’s clearly a need for it — there’s clearly an interest,” Pirotti said. “The key is getting more faculty members who are interested in teaching it and in running it. I hope it does grow.”
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed a quote by Nancy Harazduk to Carol Day.

Washington, D.C., faces the challenge of accommodating 700 displaced families during the hypothermia season from Nov. 1 to April 1, when below-freezing temperatures trigger the right-to-shelter law in D.C. that mandates housing for all homeless people.
The surge in homeless families seeking shelter has prompted Mayor Muriel Bowser’s administration to be proactive in its approach, renting out motel rooms to 400 families to facilitate potentially record-breaking numbers before the annual cold front hits the District. According to the Community Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness, there are around 7,784 homeless individuals in D.C. on a given night. Bowser allocated a $23 million budget to combat homelessness this year.
The D.C. Council established guidelines for the construction of six dormitory-style facilities to replace the dilapidated D.C. General Hospital shelter, which Bowser vowed to shutter Nov. 3. The shelter, located in southeast D.C., is overcrowded with upward of 250 families and has been plagued with complaints of poor sanitary conditions and internal dysfunction since its conversion from a hospital in 2010.
The six replacement shelters will house no more than 50 families each, and will provide rehabilitative services including job placement and work readiness training. The shelters aim to slash the length of time homeless families need to find stable housing to 60 to 90 days, down from the nine- to 12-month average stay of families in the D.C. General Hospital.
Dora Taylor, the public information officer for the mayoral department of human services, said the community-based nature of the new shelters will hopefully alleviate the difficulties of searching for housing.
“The concept behind smaller community-based shelters is that people can stay within their own communities and hopefully return to stable housing as soon as possible but also have access to those supports in their own communities,” Taylor said. “The way the current system runs with D.C.
General, when you become displaced or become homeless you generally have to leave your community to receive shelter service and generally you have to pull your children out of their school in a process that’s just one big nightmare.”
In its guidelines, the council rejected Councilmember Mary Cheh’s (D-Ward 3) amendment requiring private bathrooms for each housing unit. In a nine to four vote, it opted instead for Chairman Phil Mendelson’s (D-At Large) compromise, which mandates that a minimum of 10 percent of units have private bathrooms. Proponents maintain the decision is more cost-effective and will save approximately $1 million in construction costs and $225,000 per year in a 20-year lease.
However, advocates for the homeless condemn the lack of private bathrooms laid out in the construction guidelines. Critics of the plan argue private bathrooms are essential to the safety and dignity of homeless families, citing uncomfortable or dangerous situations in communal restrooms. These include the contraction of infections from other inhabitants and decisions of whether to send young boys to the men’s bathrooms unaccompanied or into the women’s ones with their mothers.
Nassim Moshiree, a staff attorney for the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless, said the council’s cost concerns do not justify the deprivation of safety for children and the disabled who will live in the shelters.
“There are things that, even if they cost more, are such a basic level of dignity that if they cost more, you find the money,” Moshiree said. “You don’t just take away that very basic need that people have, and that’s how we see private bathrooms.”
Moshiree said that, ultimately, it is the responsibility of members of the D.C. Council, as well as advocacy groups and private citizens, to be vigilant about the conditions of the homeless under the mayor’s plan.
“Even the councilmembers who passed the law with 10 percent private bathrooms said this is going to be a bare minimum requirement and that they would want to see the mayor go above what is required in the law,” Moshiree said. “We are hoping that the mayor will take that opportunity and maximize the number of private bathrooms that they actually build in the replacement shelters and that we all will keep an eye out on and keep advocating for the rights of people who are all too often forgotten by the community.”
However, Taylor maintained that the council’s decision was realistic in terms of budgetary constraints and does not compromise the dignity of families residing in the shelter.
“Each shelter is going to be smaller, and it’ll be easier for families to share spaces if there are not as many families demanding those spaces,” Taylor said. ”I think in the end people will just have to see the end result, but the plan for these shelters is that they’re modernized, they are state-of-the-art, they are extremely dignified, and I would even go so far as to say that they’re beautiful.”
In addition to closing down the D.C. General Hospital shelter, Mayor Bowser vowed to eradicate veteran homelessness by the end of this year, family homelessness by 2017 and all chronic homelessness by 2020.
Mandy Brouillard (NHS ’18), who serves as a Friday Foods coordinator for Hoya/Homeless Outreach Programs and Education, said the investment in smaller shelters would mitigate some of the problems she witnesses during weekly conversations with the homeless as she delivers them sandwiches for the Friday Foods program.
“I think that recognizing flaws in the shelter system is an important step to providing more efficient housing,” Brouillard said. “In the longterm, investing in smaller shelters and permanent housing will pay off. … Providing housing up front for those who want it both protects their dignity and has been shown to save money.”

The Institute of Politics and Public Service launched its Women and Politics speaker series, set to run throughout the election cycle and host speakers from professions including political operations and journalism, Nov. 9.
IPPS Executive Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94) said plans for the series are currently amorphous and that the frequency of events and topics for issues covered will develop based on student input.
“There are a lot of different issues, a lot of different topics we want to cover. We’re going to try to get as many of them in as we can,” Elleithee said. “But we also want to hear from students what they’d like to explore. So over the course of the academic year we’ll be getting ideas for these different panels from a lot of different places.”
Elleithee said the series will run as long as it is supported by student interest.
“None of these issues are going to go away. And so, yes, we have an election coming up in 2016, but, however that turns out it’s not like these issues go away,” Elleithee said. “This is something we’re committed to for the long haul.”
The series will be interactive, rather than lecture-based, giving students opportunities to have conversations with speakers and panelists one-to-one.
According to Elleithee, the current political landscape has brought discussion on women in politics to the forefront of public concern.
“You hear in every election candidates talking about women’s issues,” Elleithee said. “Women in politics is clearly a force and something to be explored and discussed. … Women are a majority of the electorate now, but too often they’re treated like a minority.”
Elleithee added that the IPPS hopes that hosting the series will encourage more women to engage in politics.
“Focusing on the issues that are driving the political system, focusing on the people that are driving the political system around these issues, the hope is really to engage more women across the ideological spectrum,” Elleithee said. “By engaging [students] on the very real societal issues around engagement of women in politics, we hope that students will challenge the political professionals to figure out ways to do it better.”
The first event included a talk with Managing Director of Research at Purple Strategies Margie Omero and co-founder of Echelon Insights Kristen Soltis Anderson. Omero and Anderson also co-host a weekly podcast called “The Pollsters,” which will feature a recording of the event in a future episode.
Omero stressed the need for not only women but also all members of the political community to discuss women in politics.
“They’re your family members. If you’re not a woman, then you’re related to a woman or you’re in a household with a woman or you have a friend, mothers, sisters, co-workers, employees, employers who are all women,” Omero said.
She also noted that while there have been advances in broadening the scope of women’s issues, there is still room for progress.
“It’s not just about abortion and birth control. It’s about things like gender pay equity, preschool, college affordability, national child care policy, gender discrimination in the workplace, health care affordability and elder care,” Omero said.
Niritta Patel (NHS ’19) said she believes that the Women and Politics series will help her and other students become more politically involved.
“I personally don’t know too much about politics, and I’ve never really been involved, so I think having IPPS especially on campus geared towards women would definitely be a big step,” Patel said.

School of Foreign Service professor Christine Fair came under criticism from media outlets after advocating for the continued use of drones in civilian-inhabited environments in a televised discussion on Al Jazeera on Oct. 23.
Fair, a professor in the security studies program, debated the effectiveness of drone strikes in Pakistan with Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Glenn Greenwald on Al Jazeera’s “The Arena” program.
Following her Al Jazeera appearance, Fair received criticism mainly from social media and from an article in Salon saying she had a “lack of etiquette” and “advocates for a belligerent foreign policy.”
In response to Twitter complaints that Fair would not give Greenwald the opportunity to speak during the debate, Fair tweeted, “Yep. Shut that lying clown down. I don’t care if I you think I’m a rambo bitch. Do you know why? I AM a rambo bitch.”
Fair, who advocates for the continued use of drone strikes against high-profile targets, debated against Greenwald, who opposes drone strikes due to their high percentage of alleged civilian casualties.
The discussion emerged in light of the release of classified government documents indicating that drones may not be effective in counterterrorism by The Intercept, an online publication co-founded by Greenwald and eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.
“What [the documents] do primarily is confirm what the people in the regions where the drones have been killing people have been saying, which is that far more often than not they’re killing people not who are the targets, but who are innocent,” Greenwald said.
Greenwald pointed to documents and surveys conducted in affected regions to support his belief that drones are not effective and may do more harm than good.
“You’ve heard this from people in Afghanistan and Pakistan continuously, you’ve heard it from researchers and scientists. … The reason we’re constantly turning more people into terrorists than we’re killing is because the anger and rage from these innocent victims is what then causes people to want to bring violence to the United States,” Greenwald said.
In response to Greenwald’s claims, Fair raised concerns with the documents themselves. She argued that the data are untrustworthy, making it unethical for Greenwald to say that drones are not effective, as the data do not represent the majority of drone strikes.
“So let’s imagine that you have a fishbowl full of 10,000 distinct marbles,” Fair said. “If they’re randomly drawn you can make some limited statements about what those 10,000 marbles look like. But if those 87 are not drawn randomly, maybe they’re the smallest, maybe they’re the biggest. … You can’t make any generalizations.”
Fair and Greenwald then argued over the validity of Greenwald’s claims and the success of the drone program itself. As both attempted to speak over the other, Fair argued that she was the only one bringing substantial points to the discussion.
“I actually bring nuance to this, I’m sorry,” Fair said. “This is not ranked propaganda, you don’t know data. Are you capable of being truthful?”
While Fair continues to comment on the lack of evidence presented during the Al Jazeera debate, she said events like the debate do not impact her work.
“Quite frankly I’m in a security studies program where people like Glenn Greenwald don’t really have a lot of credibility,” Fair said. “Many of the people in our program are military personnel, State Department personnel, CIA personnel. … We have people all over the government.”
According to Fair, Greenwald was misinformed and presented little evidence.
“It takes a while to unpack someone’s nonsense with data,” Fair said. “You can say any outrageous claim and not have to back it up. But from my point of view, I had to unpack his dubious claims and that’s harder to do than him just spewing out nonsense.”
In an article in The Huffington Post following the debate, Fair continued to defend her stance and criticized the debate format.
“Oddly, the show was largely focused on Pakistan,” Fair wrote. “However, the ‘Drone Papers’ were not about Pakistan at all — they were about Afghanistan, Yemen and Somalia. And drone strikes in these countries are actually quite different.”
In the article, Fair presented her own data to support her claim that drone strikes do indeed effectively kill militants.
“Villagers claimed that, according to the AP report, ‘at least 194 people killed in the attacks, about 70 percent — at least 138 — were militants,” Fair wrote. “The remaining 56 were either civilians or tribal police, and 38 of them were killed in a single attack on March 17, 2011. Excluding [one catastrophically disastrous strike] … nearly 90 percent of the people killed were militants.’”
Professor in the Security Studies Program Paul Sullivan wrote in an email to The Hoya that the debate about how best to tackle terrorism should move to discussing its root causes instead of focusing on military solutions.
“Military operations are not sufficient to reduce terrorism,” Sullivan wrote. “They can sometimes incite it. Economic, political, diplomatic, informational, cyber and other operations need to be combined in a long term grand strategic manner, not just in tactical, short run manners for any long term solution or mitigation of terrorism to occur.”
According to Fair, the format of and questions asked in the debate were not fair to begin with, necessitating her response.
“It was very clear that these two were going to conspire to make it difficult for me to back up with data my reasons for discounting virtually everything that he said,” Fair said. “I said, ‘Fine, I’m going to do what you’re doing.’ This isn’t a fair fight, and I’m not going to act like it is one.”
