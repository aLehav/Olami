After finishing its five-year maintenance report in 2014, the McDonough School of Business will tweak its mission statement and practices to meet new accreditation standards, which emphasize global commerce as a component of business education.
The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International, which accredits MSB every five years, implemented the changes April 8 after over two years of research, having last updated its standards in 2012.
“What we’re really asking business schools to do is to expand their mission statements to better differentiate a business school from other schools and focus on their distinctive abilities and programs,” said Robert Reid, executive vice president and chief accreditation officer ofAASCB.
The MSB was given the opportunity to either implement the changes immediately or delay them after the five-year report was complete. School administrators chose the latter option to ensure continuity in the report and will wait to evaluate any changes to the MSB until after its completion.
“We will begin working with the new standards after the 2014 review process,” MSB Deputy Dean Pietra Rivoliwrote in an email.
The accreditation changes are primarily directed at international business schools and include broadening a school’s mission statement to focus on academic impact, increasing engagement among faculty, students and business professionals and ensuring that intellectual contributions consist of business management theory and teaching.
“In this context of constant change, the new accreditation standards will not only validate quality management education and impactful research, but also help business schools provide the leadership, skills and knowledge necessary to the communities they serve,” AACSB Blue Ribbon Committee on Accreditation Quality Chair Richard Sorensen wrote in a press release April 9.
According to Sorensen, the new guidelines will provide business schools increased flexibility in defining their own mission statements and in meeting the unique needs of their students and faculty.
“The new environment calls for schools to focus on their distinctive mission and value proposition,” Sorensen wrote. “Students, employers and society as a whole expect a great deal from business schools — especially when it comes to addressing the most challenging issues of the world.”
Moreover, the AACSB changes are designed to reflect the increasingly global nature of business education, including the proliferation of online business courses.
“There is a growing business case among both students and employers for online learning, experiential learning and for making an impact,” Rivoli wrote. “The new standards take into account the diverse ways in which business schools from cultures around the world achieve their goals.”
The changes will also place increased emphasis on faculty members with real world experiences, as opposed to merely business education.
Marketing professor Marlene Towns said that she believed it was important for business school professors to have experience outside the classroom.
“I definitely feel like having real-world experience adds a certain richness to our classroom discussion,” Towns said. “Georgetown has always had a great balance of both theory and practice — many of my colleagues have worked in consulting or as entrepreneurs.”
Bharat Kaku, a visiting associate professor in the MSB, agreed but cautioned that experience and research are equally important aspects in a good business professor.
“I guess there are some advantages in that these people could talk about their experiences,” Kakusaid. “On the other hand, they might not be as up to date on current research.”
Nevertheless, Rivoli said that she did not see a dramatic difference between the new standards and old ones.
“The new standards provide additional flexibility to address changes that have happened in the field of business education over the last decade,” Rivoli wrote. “They now want to see how business education impacts society and how it can create innovation in business practices.”
Overall, Rivoli stressed the importance of the five-year accreditation cycle.
“Whether using the old or the new standards, we feel that the five-year accreditation maintenance process is valuable to the school,” Rivoli wrote. “It is important to step back and evaluate ourselves — and seek external input — to see if we are meeting and exceeding our teaching and learning goals.”

Students from across the globe presented original economics research at the 12th annual Carroll Round, an international economics undergraduate research conference held on campus this weekend.
The conference featured 28 student presentations on topics including economic theory, finance and development. Presenters were selected from a pool of 110 applicants, and came from countries including the United Kingdom, Bulgaria and Singapore.
Hadi Elzayn, a student at Columbia University, presented his thesis on gentrification and integration in Chicago.
“I have already started looking at segregation in other cities and there are some really interesting patterns,” Elzayn said. “I think in this context of race and the role it has played in U.S. history it is very interesting to look at from this sort of lens.”
Stanford professor John Taylor and Princeton professor Janet Currie delivered the keynote lectures. Taylor is known for creating the Taylor rule, a monetary policy that relates inflation, interest rates and other economic conditions. Taylor explained how a higher level of economic freedom and limited monetary intervention will help restore growth — the topic of his new book — in his lecture Friday.
Currie gave a speech Saturday titled “Causes and Consequences of Health in Early Life,” discussing the connection between health at birth and success later in life and presenting evidence that poorer mothers have less healthy children, a legacy that follows these children throughout their lifetimes.
Conference adviser and School of Foreign Service Dean Mitch Kaneda stressed the relevance of the conference to Georgetown as a whole.
“It has the effect of putting Georgetown on the map as a place for excellence in undergraduate economics,” Kaneda said.
Carroll Round steering committee chair Glenn Russo (COL ’13) highlighted the conference as a key opportunity for undergraduate research at Georgetown.
“Institutionally, we have become a big part of undergraduate research on campus,” Russo said. “Our mission is to make sure undergraduate research stays central to the campus, specifically in economics, and to make sure any student interested in research has the ability to do that.”
Kaneda added that Carroll Round has increased professors’ awareness of undergraduate research.
“At the undergraduate teaching level, it has made professors notice that undergraduates can do original research,” Kaneda said. “It may have helped in creating a trend among professors to expect more from the undergraduates.”
According to Russo, the conference, which originally included only American students, has grown in popularity, attention and scope.
“I think we consistently improved the number and quality of applications every year,” Russo said.
Carroll Round steering committee members said they hoped the conference would inspire future generations to push the boundaries of economic knowledge to further the inquisitive spirit of Georgetown students.
“We really encourage undergraduates to engage in research,” Carroll Round steering committee member Heather Hedges (SFS ’14) said. “The whole idea is to get students working with professors and outside organizations to do some really cool economic research. It embodies everything that Georgetown stresses when you come here to be a student. It is the culmination of being a student.”
Leyla Mocan, a student from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania presented her thesis on education reform in Turkey and its impact on wages. Mocan was impressed by the high quality of the conference presentations.
“I think it’s a unique experience to be with so many people who are so accomplished,” she said. “The level of confidence of the work is really there.”
Macalester College student Alexandra Indarte won an award for best paper, while Phoebe Kotlikoff of the United States Naval Academy earned best participant. The Kaneda Award for Outstanding Young Economist went to Yi Jie Gwee of the London School of Economics.

Author Geraldine Brooks explained the effect that Australian and New Zealand Army Corps Day had on her career as a war correspondent Monday.
Sponsored by the Center for Australian, New Zealand and Pacific Studies and the Embassy of Australia, the lecture, “The Meaning of Home,” was part of the annual series honoring ANZAC Day, a holiday observed by Australians and New Zealanders to honor their countries’ soldiers who died in war.
Brooks, an Australian native, started out as a reporter for The Sydney Morning Herald. After getting her master’s degree at Columbia University, she later became a war correspondent for The Wall Street Journal in Africa, the Middle East and the Balkans.
“The most important thing I learned is that it’s a privilege and a duty to bear witness [to war], particularly if you become enmeshed in the affairs of countries,” she said. “In their violent struggles, somebody has to bear witness to the effects of [violence’s] presence there.”
Brooks said that national opinion of ANZAC Day has changed since it was largely disregarded by her generation, which was strongly anti-war.
“When I was at university, [ANZAC Day] was something that you mocked,” she said. “You mocked this dedication of the old guys who wanted to glorify war.”
However, Brooks said her understanding of the day changed as her career developed. She said her most memorable experience of the holiday was covering the ANZAC Day march for The Sydney Morning Herald
“I was there and there were the last remnants of the First World War. The extremely venerable, fragile, elderly men were there on their horses, completely mastering their horses, and I was standing there and the tears were running down my cheeks,” she said. “It wasn’t about glorifying war at all. It was about honoring the sacrifices of the common soldier and somehow that message shifted and the whole nature of the [holiday] changed.”
Brooks, whose American-born father fought for Australian forces during World War II, continues to commemorate ANZAC Day even though she is now living in the United States.
“I don’t think I’ll ever lose touch with the ANZAC tradition. I have my dad’s medals and I like to think about him on ANZAC Day because it meant so much to him,” she said.
Brooks has passed on the ANZAC day tradition to her eldest son.
“He totally understands it,” she said. “We’ve read extensively about it and he found it extremely moving — the idea of sacrifice.”

D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray touted Washington’s economic rebound while presenting his budget proposal for fiscal year 2014 to residents of Ward 2 at the Charles Sumner School on Saturday.
According to Gray, the $10.1 billion budget proposal is indicative of the District’s renewed fiscal health because D.C. has accumulated a $1.5 billion surplus after two years of net revenue following three years of decline during the recession. The unemployment rate has also improved, with 30,000 new private sector jobs compensating for a net loss of 1,100 government jobs in the city.
The mayor explained how his proposed budget compares to that in other major cities.
“We are a state, a county, a city and a school district all rolled into one,” Gray said, encouraging residents to vote in today’s budget autonomy resolution that would give the District more control over its tax dollars from the federal government.
Gray was joined at the town hall meeting by Councilman Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), who said in a February interview with The Hoya that he plans on challenging Gray for the mayor’s office in November 2014. Neither Gray nor Evans has officially filed paperwork for the next mayoral election and neither discussed the upcoming race at the meeting.
Gray’s budget supports his One City Action Plan, which aims to grow and diversify D.C.’s economy, improving quality of life for D.C. residents.
During the town hall, Evans introduced new budget proposals that would directly benefit Ward 2. For example, Stead Park by Dupont Circle will be renovated with $1.6 million by fiscal year 2015, and the Georgetown Department of Motor Vehicles in Georgetown Park mall’s reopening, slated for October 2013, will be fully funded at $2.7 million.
In addition, the budget dedicated $400 million to the D.C. Streetcar project, which will have a line from Minnesota Avenue to the Georgetown waterfront. The university and the Georgetown Business Improvement District have both voiced a desire to have the line expanded closer to the university.
In an Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E meeting in October 2011, Gray said he sided with neighbors as opposed to the university in the university’s 2010 Campus Plan, noting that enrollment caps should remain in order to mitigate neighbor concerns. Evans was also a public opponent of the campus plan and endorsed proposals to move students back on campus.
Furthermore, Gray said that over the next six years, $259 million will be spent on a Ward 2 capital plan, which would include money for infrastructure and public areas such as parks.
Concerning other areas of D.C., Gray expressed optimism that new healthcare training facilities in St. Elizabeths Hospital and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center would encourage D.C. residents to fill jobs in the city. Currently, approximately 30 percent of city jobs are held by residents.
In addition, D.C. Chief Financial Officer Natwar Gandhi will retire in June with a $417 million budget surplus.
During the town hall, Gandhi added that the city has also undergone significant financial improvements recently, indicated by the 1,200 people moving into the city each month. He contrasted this with the mass exodus from the city during the 1980s and 1990s.
To continue this growth, city officials have also strived to reduce retail leakage. For example, Washington, D.C.’s first Costco opened Nov. 29. Moreover, the projected budget surplus for the coming year is $190 million, which will ensure that no new taxes will be introduced.
Overall, the budget called for a $100 million investment in affordable housing in the district. It also aims to renovate and replace lost federal funds for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.
Other plans include hospital renovations for increased healthcare access, a new facility for D.C. archives, parks renovations, improvements to public libraries, senior citizen care and a fund to provide grants to nonprofits for community service.
Despite Gray’s optimism regarding the budget, Garrison Elementary School parent Dana Miller, who attended the town hall, expressed disappointment with the city administration’s promises regarding the school system.
“[Garrison Elementary] was to be modernized in 2012. Now we’re slated to be modernized in 2014, 2015, not to be completed until 2022,” Miller said. “We’re trying to talk to everyone. It’s a huge step for us to be given a name of someone at a high level who has the potential to make a change.”
In response to that, however, Gray said that projects which have been in limbo for a long time will soon be completed. As an example, Gray cited the Skyland Town Center project in southeast D.C., which has been in limbo since 1989.
Dail Doucette, president of the board of Dupont Circle Main Street, an economic progress organization, also came to the meeting with concerns but left with a more positive outlook.
“The rest of the city may be flourishing, but we are not,” Doucette said. “… Nobody noticed. … I wanted to see what the program was, I wanted to hear it explained. … The plan has finite goals that are meetable.”
This meeting marked the fifth in Gray’s ward-by-ward town hall series, attempting to better educate and engage city residents.
“We’re working as hard as we can to be as transparent as we can,” Gray said. “If there’s someone who says ‘I don’t know what’s in the budget,’ it’s their own fault.”In an Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E meeting in October 2011, Gray said he sided with neighbors as opposed to the university in Georgetown’s 2010 Campus Plan, noting that enrollment caps should remain in order to mitigate neighbor concerns.

Dail Doucette, president of the board of Dupont Circle Main Street, an economic progress organization, also came to the meeting with concerns but left with a more positive outlook.
“The rest of the city may be flourishing, but we are not,” Doucette said. “… Nobody noticed. … I wanted to see what the program was, I wanted to hear it explained. … The plan has finite goals that are meetable.”

James Carville, one of the country’s most recognizable political pundits, advised students about how to approach failure and success Monday afternoon.
Carville spoke in the fourth annual Michael Jurist Lecture, dedicated in memory of Michael Jurist (SFS ’07), a former president of the Georgetown University Lecture Fund.
Carville’s success as former President Bill Clinton’s (SFS’68) campaign manager in the 1992 presidential election propelled him into the spotlight with trademark slogans such as, “It’s the economy, stupid!”
Carville brought his trademark charisma to the Hilltop, engaging students to think about — and subsequently do away with — their five-point plans and fears of failure.
“I’m gonna bore you and tell you a couple lessons I’ve learned in life,” Carville said. “Knowing what to do is the easiest part of life. Getting it done is the hard part.”
Carville also emphasized the importance of letting go of failure as the beginning of any route to success, whether political or otherwise.
“Someone at Georgetown’s got a five-point plan to save the world,” Carville said. “The worst reason someone can give you to not do something is [that] you might fail. You will never, ever succeed in life unless you’re willing to risk failure.”
Carville identified a key pattern at the root of all narratives, all of which he said begin with a lead, state a problem and reach a conclusion.
“Every piece of communication that you’ve ever read, will read, has existed, has one thing in common: setup, conflict [and] resolution … there’s no instance where it’s going to fail.”
Carville applied his theory about stories to political strategy.
“When you’re starting a movement, don’t try to change the way people think,” he said. “You can’t. It’s evolutionary.”
Carville also expressed admiration for politicians’ courage.
“Some people go to work everyday and aren’t sure if what they’re doing is making a difference,”Carville said. “I actually like politicians … they dare to fail publicly.”
Carville tried to advise students by joking about his own experiences with failure.
“Get out there. Go for it. The worst thing ever? You make a fool of yourself. I’ve done it a gazilliontimes,” Carville said. “What a great time to go out in the world — when everything is screwed up.”
Though Carville mostly imparted advice to students throughout his talk, during the question-and-answer session he touched on his expertise in politics. He discussed how southern Democrats could regain their prominence in the post-Clinton era.
“For a long time, there was this talk about who was going to get Bubba,” Carville said. “And guess what, the Democrats lost it. What price did they pay for that? We gave up high school white males and gained educated white women. Do we risk this growing demographic that we have now? No, we don’t.”

Daniel Casasanto, a professor of cognitive psychology at the New School for Social Research, explained differences in the way people express time through hand gestures across cultures Friday.
Casasanto, whose presentation was part of a speaker series sponsored by the Linguistics Department, focuses his research on metaphors people use to compare space and time through gesture and language.
He has found that although both native English and Arabic speakers use the time-space metaphor, they use it in different ways.
“We talk about time all the time. In fact, the word ‘time’ is the most commonly used noun in the English language,” Casasanto said. “The way we study people’s conception of time is to look at spatial gestures.
Casasanto observed that English and Spanish speakers tended to gesture with their right hands to describe future events, while Arab speakers used their left hands.
He said the difference could be attributed to the differing direction of written Arabic and Spanish.
“Simply reading and writing forces you to travel through space and through time, one direction or the other,” Casasanto said.
However, the correlation of the direction of time being described and the direction of the gesture does not necessarily translate into a causal relationship.
In the third portion of his research, Casasanto examined how the mindsets of people’s native cultures affected how they gestured. He found that cultures and individuals’ perceptions of the future and past depended on focus
“Focusing on the past — situationally or habitually — can make people more likely to think past-ahead or future-behind,” Casasanto said. “It raises the question, how many more cultures out there think about time backwards, and we don’t know it, because they don’t talk about it that way?”
According to Casasanto, recent events might be described on a vertical axis while those far in the past would be described laterally.
Colleen Diamond, a first-year doctoral candidate studying theoretical linguistics, appreciated the inter-disciplinary nature of the Linguistics Department speaker series.
“It’s really interesting that they bring people from so many different disciplines,” Diamond said. “It keeps you updated on all the current research that’s going on.”
Ava Irani (GRD ’14) expected the connection between gestures and verbal descriptions to be similar across all cultures.
“A lot of it was cultural, that took me by surprise,” she said.

With less than six weeks until construction begins on the Healey Family Student Center, student groups currently housed in the New South space received a memorandum from the Center for Student Programs notifying them of space available in other areas on campus to supplement storage and recreational space.
Although the memo provided long-term solutions for storage, it offered only short-term options for practice space for organizations and rehearsal space for performing groups.
The fencing team, club triathlon, dance groups and other organizations that use equipment would be housed in the LXR Multipurpose Room and would follow a schedule similar to that of Riverside Lounge in New South. However, these groups would have to schedule practices in compliance with the dormitory’s night-time quiet hours.
Mary Lim (SFS ’13), a dancer with Flip Dis Funk Dat, said that LXR would not be an adequate alternative to Riverside Lounge.
“Because LXR is very similar to a living -room situation, it is not very fitting for dance groups. I don’t know how many [groups] are in LXR, but it doesn’t seem very appropriate.” Lim said. “LXR seems suboptimal.”
Performance groups that do not require equipment would be housed in the Center Grill betweenMakom and Cosi in the Leavey Center. Groups using the storage spaces located in New South would move to new space on the mezzanine level of Regents Hall. As a result of extra funding allocated by the Georgetown University Student Association Finance and Appropriations Committee from the student activity fee, the space in Regents would also feature secure storage units.
Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14), GUSA senior counselor and director of student space, praised the storage options offered by the CSP.
“I think the new storage space is a huge win for the groups that are being kicked out, but also all the student groups in general,” Appelbaum said. “The storage space is huge, bigger than any other storage space on campus, bigger than the New South space.”
Morgan McDaniel (SFS ’13), chair of the Center for Social Justice Advisory Board for Student Organizations, was glad that her groups’ needs would be met.
“We’re not left out of the plan in that we’re included in the permanent storage solutions, so our groups will be included in that storage facility, which we’re very happy about,” McDaniel said.
The plan also would not provide long-term solutions for CSJ organizations that use New South as storage and office space. Instead, these groups would be relocated to Poulton Hall, where the CSJ is based.
“It’s probably not going to be possible to have a permanent office space for CSJ groups throughout the next year, so we’re looking into some options for temporary office space, possibly in the fourth floor of the Leavey Center,” McDaniel said.
Maya Chaudhuri (SFS ’13), a member of the CSJ Advisory Board, expressed frustration at the lack of permanent space available for CSJ groups.
“It’s definitely frustrating not to be allocated space for CSJ groups, but I don’t think this is a problem that rose today with the memo … it’s part of a larger structural problem,” she said. “We think that if student groups that are social justice groups lose this space, no one is going to work towards replacing it. Our worry is that it’s a long-term loss and not just a temporary loss.”
Chaudhuri said this was especially troubling in light of the increased interest in CSJ programming.
“There’s a huge increase in the number of people starting CSJ groups and participating in existing groups, and a big part of the problem is that we have more students interested in social justice than we have space allocated in [Poulton Hall],” Chaudhuri said.
The memo did not provide specific solutions for performing arts groups that use the New South space, and instead directed them to report to the Department of Performing Arts for their new space assignments.

Although students sometimes show up to class in sweatpants, Georgetown faculty generally disagreed with the results of a recent survey that characterized college students as unprofessional.
The report, released by the Center for Professional Excellence at York College in January 2013, found that approximately one-third of surveyed professors believed that less than 50 percent of their students had qualities associated with being professional in the workplace.
According to the report, professors defined professionalism as necessitating interpersonal skills, a strong work ethic, focus and dependability. The study also added several indicators for professionalism, including accepting responsibility for actions, being prepared and demonstrating good reading and writing skills. On a scale from one to five, with five meaning that the quality was very prevalent among students, the mean score that professors gave for such indicators was slightly under three.
School of Foreign Service Dean Carol Lancaster defined professionalism in a similar manner.
“You need to be good writer — preferably an articulate speaker — you need to be able to make decisions on priorities, [and] you need to communicate your ideas without offending others,” Lancaster said. “I think all of those things … students pick up in the classroom.”
The report stated that professors think that student professionalism has decreased in recent years, noting an increasing sense of entitlement as a major cause.
Some Georgetown faculty members, however, disagreed with the findings.
“I think our students do leave here with the skills to be professional in the workspace, and they acquit themselves pretty well in the workplace,” Georgetown College Dean Chester Gillis said.
Lancaster noted that in her time at Georgetown, students have increasingly been willing to articulate opinions and have improved in writing abilities.
“I don’t see students as being less professional,” Lancaster said. “I feel they are more prepared than they have ever been. Students often come in here as adolescents and leave here as young men and women.”
Nevertheless, there are areas where faculty said Georgetown students show a lack of professionalism, such as the use of technology in the classroom. The York study cited technological etiquette as especially lacking among undergraduates today.
In particular, Gillis lamented students’ tendency to check Facebook during class.
“That’s unacceptable in my view,” Gillis said.
Faculty members also admitted to seeing the sense of entitlement mentioned in the survey present in the Georgetown student body.
“Our culture condones, ‘Everybody gets a trophy.’ … That’s not the way it is in real life,” Gillis said. “Even in a fine institution like Georgetown, it’s not all teeth of a comb. Everybody is not identical, and they do not perform identically.”
According to Gillis, students’ willingness to return late from spring and Easter breaks reflects this sense of entitlement.
“It’s not alright. It’s not acceptable,” Gillis said. “In the professional world, you won’t do that.”
Psychology professor Steven Sabat attributed this sense of entitlement to the pressure put on students to achieve good grades.
“I think a lot of people here are beyond reason intense about things like grades. Grades are the most important thing, and they have less fun learning because of that,” Sabat said. “It’s almost as if they have gotten into this habit of worrying.”
However, Sabat and other faculty members said that the sense of entitlement is only present in a small portion of the student body.
“I don’t think most people are like, ‘Here I am; give me an A,’” Sabat said.
Patricia Cloonan, chair of the health systems administration department in the School of Nursing & Health Studies, said that the majority of Georgetown students seem to be grateful to be at the university, adding that Georgetown’s location offers students an introduction to professionalism early on.
“We hear from our students that one of the reasons they came to Georgetown was to be in the nation’s capital with its many possibilities for personal and professional growth,” Cloonan said. “That motivation makes our students aware of life after Georgetown and really opens the door for faculty mentorship when it comes to professional development.”
Gillis agreed, adding that student involvement in internships encourages professionalism. CawleyCareer Center Executive Director Mike Schaub noted that this attitude at school and internships transfers to workplace behavior.
“Employers generally have very positive things to say about students’ level of professionalism and preparedness in the workplace,” Schaub wrote in an email. “Most of our graduating seniors experienced different work environments through their professional internships, and these work experiences prepare our students well for employment after graduation.”

Georgetown students will teach business and entrepreneurial skills to GED diploma candidates in Columbia Heights through Venture Forward, a new club focused on education and mentorship that officially launched this month.
Venture Forward aims to build relationships between Georgetown students and the Latin American Youth Center, a program in Columbia Heights that already works with recent GED diploma recipients not enrolled in college and young adults working toward GED certificates. LAYC students range from 16- to 25-year-olds, and the program also enrolls them in information technology and health care courses.
“I thought the young adults in the community could talk about the issues they had growing up, talk about the things they would have loved to have,” Venture Forward founder Sam Gyory (COL ’15) said. “Basically, the idea behind it is that they’ve all grown up in Washington, D.C., and they know the social issues in [the area] better than anyone at Georgetown does.”
In the fall semester, Venture Forward will focus on education, while the group will implement these lessons in D.C. next spring.
“You get to apply your skills — the skills that you’ve learned in the first part of this course and the skills you’ve learned in school,” Gyory said. “Any type of talents you have, you will learn to apply.”
Though Georgetown students will learn from the education targeted at Columbia Heights-area students, the club primarily aims to empower LAYC students and to stress the importance of college.
“I think even though they’re in this program, it can still kind of become just mindless going to school every day and getting to a point where you’re like, ‘What’s the point of going to this?’” Gyory said. “This is a way to keep inspiring them to be like ‘College is important,’ … [that] these are the [necessary] skills … and how college can help with that.”
Club member Brett Treacy (MSB ’15) agreed.
“To me, education isn’t as much about what you learn as what you do with it,” Treacy said.
Gyory hopes that Venture Forward will help students break out of the “Georgetown bubble.”
“Georgetown students could learn more about the city that they’re in. … I felt that my freshman year, [I didn’t] know anything about Washington,” Gyory said.
Club member Betsy Alfano (MSB ’15) said that she was excited to work with members of the D.C. community.
“I’m excited to take my classroom skills off campus and meet members of the D.C. community,” Alfano said. “There is an incredible entrepreneurial spirit in Washington, and Venture Forward’s ultimate goal is to grow and cultivate the passions and dreams of others.”
Gyory said he decided to start Venture Forward after leaving campus through the D.C. Schools Project and Grassroot Hoyas.
“What I really like is that it will be fostering a relationship with someone in the community [who] is your own age,” Gyory said. “This is something that the programs here don’t really have — a lot of it is youth and you’re the mentor, but it’s not really a collaborative relationship where you’re equal to the person you’re working with.”
Venture Forward will hold another meeting before the end of the semester to establish plans for the fall.

After bombings at the Boston Marathon last Monday turned Patriots’ Day into a tragedy, a group of Georgetown students banded together to raise money for victims and their families.
Bibs for Boston raised $2,780 April 18 by selling 800 paper bibs resembling those worn in marathons and printed with Boston’s 617 area code.
Danny Lohrfink (MSB ’14) and Vince Korth (MSB ’14) came up with the idea while watching the news Monday night.
“I couldn’t stop going back to CNN.com and reading up on stories,” Lohrfink said. “I said, ‘We should do something,’ and I thought, ‘Well, it’s a marathon: let’s sell bibs.’ As I was talking, Vince was already making the design.”
Korth and Lohrfink reached out to two friends from Boston, Derek Embry (MSB ’15) and Freeman Condon (NHS ’14), to help with the cause. Condon and Embry rallied a dozen students to join them on the project.
For Lohrfink, the motivation for this project hit close to home.
“The reason why I was so interested in the first place was [because] my cousin was a block away at the time, heard it all happen, saw people bloody running towards her,” Lohrfink said. “Because we’re so close, I was moved by it and wanted to do something.”
By using Georgetown printers and purchasing limited supplies at Kinkos, the group was able to keep costs under $20 and maximize the amount of money that would go directly to the charity.
The group plans to donate all funds through the New England Patriots website to a foundation organized by Patriots owner Robert Kraft. After the bombings, Kraft announced that he would match donations the foundation receives in its first two weeks up to $100,000. As a result, Bibs for Boston had effectively raised $5,560.
Kyle O’Donnell (COL ’14), a student from Danvers, Mass., bought one of the 800 bibs that the group sold.
“I think that when it comes to a marathon, the bib is the most iconic thing that you can associate with it. It’s just a sign of support for all runners out there, especially the ones related to this incident, and it’s something you can wear with pride and really show your support,” O’Donnell said.
Within the first 15 minutes of tabling, Bibs for Boston had raised $200. The group sold all of the bibs they had printed and received several extra donations as well.
O’Donnell noted that in addition to financially supporting the bombing’s victims and their families, the fundraising efforts had a therapeutic value for Georgetown students.
“Since I’m far away from home and I wasn’t there to feel the situation, it was nice to see both students from the Boston area and students not from Boston come together in this unfortunate event,” he said.

To compensate for changes in the Medical College Admission Test, students are pushing for the addition of a social science general education requirement for science majors accompanied by a decrease in general education requirements in other subjects.
In addition to a new critical analysis and reasoning skills section, the MCAT will include a section about psychological, social and biological foundations of behavior, to go into effect in 2015.
The Association of American Medical Colleges, which administers the MCAT, added the section to account for physicians’ need to understand how people think and interact.
Science majors are currently exempt from the social science requirement expected of students in Georgetown College and the School of Nursing & Health Studies. Because pre-med students will now be tested on knowledge gained through introductory sociology and psychology courses, a social science requirement would ensure that students are properly prepared for the next section.
“It would make sense to have the social science requirement count for science majors, but to reduce the general education requirements in another area to compensate for the MCAT changes,” Riya Modi (COL ’16), a member of the College Academic Council, said. She is drafting a proposal to change the general education requirements for science majors.
However, Edward Meyertholen, assistant dean and director of pre-health programs, pointed out that not all pre-med students major in science. Non-science College majors still must fulfill a social science requirement.
“The vast majority has already taken [psychology]. I don’t think it’ll be affecting … their plans as much,” he said. “At the end, it’s going to be pretty easy for them to get the knowledge that is necessary.”
Meyertholen said that he thought the change was unnecessary, but added that because no one has actually taken the new exam, it remains unclear as to how to meet the needs of students.
Meyertholen stressed the importance of Georgetown’s independent control of curriculum.
“I don’t think medical schools should be dictating to undergraduate schools what the requirements are,” Meyertholen said.
The MCAT changes will begin to affect only those planning on entering medical school in the fall of 2016, or current freshmen.
“As it is now, the MCAT doesn’t include what [it] will when I’m taking [it],” biology major Claire Ruane (COL ’16) said. “It will be beneficial for me to have taken those classes, so I think that makes sense for them to change the requirements … but it will be a big challenge to fit those classes into an already very crowded schedule.”
Human science major Ashwin Karanam (NHS ’13), who applied to medical school, said there was not a lot of space for electives in the science curriculum.
“There’s not a lot flexibility [but] I don’t think it’s necessary to change the requirements for all sciences. The vast majority of science majors are not pre-med,” Karanam said. “I would have taken sociology and psychology instead of classes just for fun.”

The School of Continuing Studies will move to its new location in Chinatown in downtown Washington, D.C., this fall, over a year after signing a 15-year lease in July 2012.
According to Lauralyn Lee, associate vice president of community engagement and strategic initiatives, the move from M Street to a 91,000 square-foot campus at 640 Massachusetts Ave. NW was chosen for convenience, as it has parking close by, is located near the Circulator bus route and is accessible by all Metro lines. SCSadministrators declined to comment on the price of the lease.
The search for a new location began about four years ago due to higher enrollment than expected in its master’s programs, SCS Interim Dean Walter Rankin said. Moving graduate students to a downtown campus is also a component of the 2010 Campus Plan agreement.
“Originally, we thought that our public relations and corporate communications [program] would have maybe 25 to 30 students, and that program has been extremely popular with close to 300 students,” Rankin said. “We really needed to find a new location where we will have classrooms and spaces for students to meet.”
However, SCS Senior Associate Dean Jim Parenti expressed concerns that SCS students could miss out on the traditional Georgetown experience with the new downtown location.
“It’s a shiny new building, and it’s sometimes harder to get a feel for Georgetown, where you already have these fantastic older brick-and-mortar buildings,” Parenti said. “When you get into the new space, you want to keep the feeling of … what it means to be a Georgetown student.”
The new SCS facilities will include study rooms, a 130-person auditorium, a digital media lab, a library resource center, a bookstore and several lounge and meeting areas. In addition, the campus incorporates features not available on the main campus, including an Apple computer lab and a broadcast studio that will allow faculty to record live videos. All classrooms are also fitted withEcho360 Lecture Capture, which both SCS and the main campus currently use.
Parenti expressed confidence that the new building will carry on the Georgetown tradition.
“I think that this new location is all about new possibilities for our students, state-of-the-art facilities — really an opportunity to learn and study in a world-class environment in the fastest and most productive area in the city,” Parenti said.
Parenti added that the new location would allow graduate programs to engage more fully with social justice by being in close contact with service organizations in the neighborhood.
SCS Chief of Staff Christina Roberts said that the influx of 1,100 degree and 2,000 non-degree students, 300 faculty and 100 administrators and staff into the neighborhood would change the nature of the area, especially its commerce.
“As far as outreach to the community, we’ve been fortunate to be welcomed by the Business Improvement District,” Roberts said. “They’ve welcomed Georgetown with open arms, looking for ways to cooperate with the community in terms of meeting space, events and industry connections for our students.”
Rankin noted that the LivingSocial headquarters, the Urban Land Institute, National Public Radio and the Newseum, all located nearby, tie specifically into various programs in the SCS.
Lee said that the SCS administration hopes that its new downtown location will mirror the success of the Georgetown University Law Center. Although the law school originally began with one building, it has since developed into a multi-building campus by Capitol Hill.
“It will really benefit the students and also the city as we continue to enhance our footprint there,” Lee said. “We believe the enhanced presence downtown will benefit our students, who will appreciate the accessible urban location and will bring further vibrancy and opportunities for growth to an area of the city that is quickly developing.”
In addition to expanding its downtown presence, SCS will add two master’s programs in urban and regional planning and emergency and disaster management.
According to Rankin, SCS chose these programs because they involve fast-growing, high-profile industries that often require master’s degrees for career advancement.
SCS, which utilizes practice-oriented curriculums for its programs, will continue its commitment to applied education and research opportunities through these two programs. For example, the emergency and disaster management program will partner with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, immersing students in the field before graduation.
Rankin said that students would also benefit from studying abroad at the School of Foreign Service in Doha, Qatar.
“Both these programs fit terrifically well with the movement of the entire world,” Rankin said. “Since we already have a campus in Qatar, we can look at the potential risks of hosting something like the World Cup, or how to prepare for the tragedy in Boston, how to prepare for multicultural issues and look at how they’re building an entire infrastructure in Qatar.”

The GUSA senate unanimously passed a resolution Sunday night that called for extending the Rosslyn, Wisconsin Avenue and Dupont Circle Metro Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle weekend bus schedules.
The bill is similar to a failed 2011 attempt by the GUSA senate to implement “Night Owl” and “Early Bird” shuttles to Dupont Circle. The bill, though passed unanimously by the senate, was not supported by the administration due to funding constraints.
Sponsored by Georgetown University Student Association senator Mary Beth Brosnihan (SFS ’13), this year’s resolution seeks to expand service to the three locations on Saturdays and Sundays from 6 a.m. to 1 a.m. with at least one stop every hour.
“If [the university is] not supporting transportation options, then we are not able to enjoy [the rest of D.C.]” Brosnihan said. “Transportation should not be a reason why students are not exploring the community.”
The GUTS bus weekend schedule currently provides a Saturday service to Rosslyn and Dupont Circle Metro, with approximately one stop every hour and a half, ending around 6 p.m. The GUTS bus service does not run at all on Sunday.
In meetings with the Office of Transportation Management, Brosnihan said that funding for the extended bus service has yet to be determined.
Brosnihan’s original bill only included extensions of the Dupont and Rosslyn shuttles. The senate amended the resolution to call for GUTS bus shuttles to Wisconsin Avenue from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. — a move that Brosnihan called “idealist,” but hoped it would be a jumping-off point for discussions with administration.
“The resolution is intended to start a conversation with administrators,” Senate Speaker George Spyropoulos (COL ’14) said.
GUSA senator Nicolò Donà Dalle Rose (SFS ’15) shared a similarly optimistic view of the resolution.
“This would be a good signal to show that expanded trips to Dupont on Saturday nights is not enough,” Dalle Rose said.
