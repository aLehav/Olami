Three Georgetown students received the 2013 Scott Weiss Scholarship, granted by the T. Howard Foundation, which aims to promote careers in multimedia and entertainment for the scholarship’s recipients.
The scholarship, awarded only to alumni of the foundation’s internship program, is intended to promote diversity.
This year, marketing major Breania Smith (MSB ’14), sports management master’s candidate Brandon Putnam (GRD ’14) and international studies major Rene Payan (SFS ’14) were among the 11 recipients from across the country.
Established in 1994, the organization has partnered with several prestigious media companies to provide undergraduate and graduate students with practical hands-on experience. The foundation created the scholarship 15 years ago.
“Across the country, T. Howard Foundation alumni are making an impact in the multimedia industry at all levels,” THF Founder, Chairman Emeritus and President & CEO of Speakeasy, Inc. Scott Weiss said in a press release. “Since our first class of 14 interns during the summer of 1995, we have been the launching pad for success for more than 700 young adults, including those who have reached the executive level at some of the most respected media companies in the world.”
The amount of the scholarship differs for each individual, but can reach up to $2,750. This year’s total awarded amount was $15,000.
“The purpose and goal of the scholarship is to continue the development of T. Howard alumnus through financial support,” Payan said. “When applying for the scholarship you must specify what you would use the money and how that will contribute to your professional growth.”
The financial aspect is of great importance, but even more valuable is the experience and resources the internship program provides.
“The biggest advantage of the T. Howard Foundation is the network and support provided to all interns and alumni,” Payan said. “Once you are a T. Howard intern you are always a part of the family and you get treated as such.”
The scholarship funds are not only used to cover tuition and textbook costs, but are also used to cover expenses necessary for furthering one’s multimedia and entertainment career.
“I will strategically divide my scholarship award amongst my tuition cost as a graduate student at Georgetown and career development opportunities, such as conferences sponsored by professional organizations and professional development workshops that will ultimately help further develop my career as a professional in the multimedia and entertainment industry,” Putnam said.
The Scott Weiss Scholarship is available to those who have acquired a favorable evaluation from the company host supervisor.
“When I help someone achieve their goals and aspirations they are then able to help someone else do the same,” Putnam said. “The T. Howard Foundation has enabled me to further spread my belief and continue to help other in the community.”
Smith could not be reached for comment.

Most Georgetown students may not know the name Tom Quinn (CAS ’55), but many would recognize him. The United States Marine, actor and Georgetown boxing legend-turned-coach was a fixture of the front desk at Yates Field House, swiping GO-Cards early in the morning.Quinn died of complications from diabetes at a hospital in Teaneck, N.J. on Jan. 5. He was 79.As a freshman at Georgetown, Quinn joined the intramural boxing team, and by senior year, he became captain of the university’s collegiate team, winning a NCAA Eastern heavyweight boxing title in his senior year, making him the university’s last champion in the sport. He is now in the Georgetown Athletic Hall of Fame, and his boxing gloves are still on display in the trophy case in McDonough Arena.After graduation, Quinn served as an officer in the United States Marine Corps before going into business. He worked at several investment firms and as a consultant for the NFL Players Association, in addition to taking up acting. In 2004, Yates Director Jim Gilroy hired Quinn to coach boxing.“We’re going to miss him,” Gilroy said. “He was such, in a quiet way, a very vivacious guy. … Beyond just teaching boxing — everybody loved his class — he had some amazing stories. He always seemed to be able to find a way to throw in Norman Mailer or someone like that that he met at some party on Long Island that he attended.”
Quinn kept close connections with those he taught throughout his years as a coach.“He loved them, and I think they really enjoyed him,” Quinn’s friend and former roommate Tony Essaye said. “He had all sorts of stories because he had such a background in boxing and knew so much about various other things. It was a boxing class but it was also entertainment to some degree because of the stories he could tell. He’ll be sorely missed. It won’t be the same class, but we’ll try to keep it going nonetheless.”
In the last 25 years of his life, Quinn split his time between coaching and acting, one of his passions. Quinn acted in many theater productions in D.C., and had minor roles in a variety of TV shows and movies, including “The Next Three Days” with Russell Crowe and “The Pelican Brief” with Denzel Washington and Julia Roberts. He also had a role in season one of “The West Wing” as John Noonan, a veteran manning the visitor’s information booth at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and a recurring role as a police officer on the first season of HBO’s “The Wire.”
“I think he’s always enjoyed doing that,” Essaye said. “He was in our senior class play and he got into it about 15 or 20 years ago, and my wife and I saw a number of theater productions he was in, which I thought he was always very good in.”
Christopher Henley, a fellow D.C. theater actor, wrote an article on DCTheaterScene.com about Quinn’s acting.“Tom would go on to act all over town, at Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company, Arena Stage, Studio Theatre, Washington Shakespeare Company and other companies,” Henley wrote. “A Queens-born and bred New Yorker, an ex-boxer and a proud Irishman, he was a great character ‘type,’ wildly useful when anyone needed to cast something involving sports, for instance.”In a profile in the guide, (“Returning Alum Boasts Knockout Career,” G3, Jan. 25, 2013), Quinn quipped about his typecast and age.“I think my career may be coming to a close when I can’t get the part as an Irish bartender,” Quinn said.According to Henley, Quinn was beloved in the theater community for his friendly attitude.
“He had a gorgeous townhouse on R [Street], opposite Dumbarton Oaks,” Henley wrote. “He let us rehearse there, even the scenes that didn’t involve him. He hosted memorable cast parties, a big step up from the pizza and beer affairs to which we were accustomed.”
Quinn made a lasting impression on the Georgetown community, and will be remembered as a fantastic boxer, actor and friend. He will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.“He was a bigger than life character in a lot of ways,” Essaye said. “Very enjoyable, interesting guy, and he was that way in college. It expanded a bit as his life developed, but I always enjoyed him and he always had many stories to tell and was always a pleasant, energetic guy to be around.”
Essaye helped Quinn teach his boxing class once a week, and he said that he hopes to keep the class going to commemorate Quinn’s legacy.“We did that together,” Essaye said. “It was really his class, but I would help out and continued to do that. … As a group, we’re trying to keep the class going for the rest of the year in his honor and hopefully we’ll be able to do that.”
He is survived by former spouse Marsha Lehman, his three children T.J., Katherine and Sarah; five grandchildren and four siblings.Quinn and Essaye spent their last day together at a Georgetown basketball game in early December.“The last time I saw him before he died, we went to see the Georgetown game against Colgate in early December,” Essaye said. “We’ve been connected through Georgetown and the last thing we did together was Georgetown, and I’ve never thought about that before. It’s kind of like bookends.”

Was rewatching My favorite Christmas episode, (In Excelsis Deo) of the West Wing and remembered how sincere Tom’s character, (John Noonan) was. After reading your article I can understand why so many people are drawn to his characters and as a person.

Since arriving on campus in October, new mascot Jack, formally known as John B. Carroll, has quietly settled in with his caretaker and six dog-walkers on the Jack Crew. As he adjusts to his duties on campus, however, he remains absent from his predecessors’ stage on the court at Verizon Center.
“We are going to hold off on having Jack perform at the games this season.  We have spoken to the Athletic Department, and although he is very well behaved and training well, we think that it would be best to slowly acclimate him to the overwhelming scene at the Verizon Center,” Jack Crew Head Kevin Voorhees (MSB ’15) wrote in an email.
While students may miss their mascot on the court at halftime, Jack can still be found around campus.
In addition to attending several men’s and women’s athletic games throughout the fall, Jack has also been visiting Verizon Center before Georgetown men’s basketball games to get accustomed to his future stage. He has also made appearances at various campus events, such as Georgetown’s recent birthday celebration.
Jack will continue to attend some official on-campus Georgetown events and support men’s and women’s athletics throughout the spring. He will also continue informally meeting students, faculty and staff during his many walks on campus and his impromptu visits to student spaces such as Lauinger Library.
His caretaker, McKenzie Stough (COL ’13), and members of the Jack Crew are excited about what the future holds for him.
“He goes on his daily walks and is commonly exposed to many students, neighbors and faculty,” Voorhees wrote. “He interacts well with everyone and is extremely friendly and playful. We use our discretion in situations that become too crowded or overwhelming.”
Stough expressed appreciation to the Jack Crew for their help with Jack’s transition, and Crew members voiced excitement for the mascot’s progress.
“The Jack Crew and I have been thrilled by Jack’s progress so far,” Stough wrote in an email. “Learning to be a mascot takes a lot of practice, but his intelligence and eagerness have allowed him to adjust quickly to campus life.”
Though the downsized six-member Jack Crew are taking it slow with the new mascot, Stough feels that Jack’s attitude shows promise for his tenure on campus.
“He is a naturally curious dog who enjoys meeting new people and exploring new places and we have been working hard to give him the opportunity to express this curiosity in all parts of the community,” Stough said.
“He is only about seven months old and can understand all basic commands.  He is very obedient most of the time and in the process of learning some new tricks and commands,” Voorhees wrote. “However, he is still a puppy and there is a lot more work to be done.”
Despite the news that the dog will not be available to bolster spirit at Verizon Center, Bulldog Advisory Committee member and GUSA Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) expressed satisfaction with the process.
“Overall, I’m extremely pleased with the university’s decision to continue the live mascot tradition on campus, and even more pleased to see that the training process is so rewarding,” Ramadan said.
Students frustrated with this season’s basketball performance have adopted a more negative tone.
“Losing Jack for the home game is worse than losing Josh Smith. The dog is much more energetic,” Chris Kelly (COL ’17) said.
However, Rebecca Anthony (COL ’16) understood why caretakers would want to be particularly vigilant with the young puppy.
“I guess it’s good that they are being cautious with Jack because of what happened with JJ, but Georgetown is known for having a bulldog at games. The team is doing so poorly this year that we really need another draw for students to come to games and have school spirit,” Anthony said.

ALEXANDER BROWN/ THE HOYAA new Congressional act that aims to limit reproductive health services by disallowing Washington, D.C. tax revenue to pay for certain programs including abortions, has both sides of the aisle up in arms about the role of D.C.’s tax dollars and women’s health.
On Jan. 15, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act passed 22-12 in front of the House Judiciary Committee. Should the act pass in the Senate, it would deny D.C. the right to use its tax dollars to pay for certain women’s health services and funding for health benefits plans that cover abortion.
“This bill is a monument to autocracy and a mockery of American democracy. Not only would this bill harm the women of the United States, it would make matters even worse for the women of the District of Columbia by also eliminating part of the local government’s authority to regulate its own affairs and spend its own funds,” Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) said in a press release issued Sunday.
Kelly Thomas (SFS ’15), treasurer of GU Right to Life, defended the act, citing it as Congressional representation of constituents’ interests across the country. According to a national CNN poll conducted in April, 61 percent of Americans oppose federal funding for abortions.
“I think Congress is ultimately a representation of constituencies across the country, and what they are doing with this bill is protecting its constituents from paying for a service that they find morally abhorrent,” Thomas said.
According to Adrienne Schreiber (COL ’05), a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, D.C, the act speaks to a much larger issue in the District of an uneven level of awareness of reproductive services
“The biggest question is mostly access. People just don’t know that they can come here for just about anything they need. It’s patient education first and foremost that needs to be addressed,” Schreiber said.
Wards 7 and 8 east of the Anacostia River are some of the city’s most underserved areas when it comes to accessing basic healthcare needs, with HIV rates of 2.6 and 3.1 percent respectively, according to data from the D.C. Department of Health.
“There’s been a big push in the last few years to get the word out that you don’t need to pay for HIV testing and condoms in the District, there are so many places that offer these services, and it’s not just in Northwest, it’s all over the District. Every single Ward has community health centers whose job it is to offer these services,” Schreiber said.
Schreiber noted, however, that disparities in awareness exist not only across locations but also across education levels.
“Places like Georgetown and Foggy Bottom — those students have access to a lot more information than a 14-year-old who’s growing up in Anacostia; the resources are very different from place to place. Absolutely there’s that disparity, and that’s what community health centers like Planned Parenthood are looking to bridge,” Schreiber said.
Access to contraceptive services is often a sticking point between liberals and conservatives on the issue of how to best educate women living in low-income, often minority areas of the District.
Laura Narefsky (COL ’14), president of H*yas for Choice, said that while ensuring access to a wide range of reproductive health services is vital, education for both men and women is essential to stemming the problem
“I think a lot of education starts early. This is a problem not just in D.C., but that we don’t have comprehensive sex ed in our school systems. You’re starting with a population of young people, men and women, who were never taught how to take care of themselves, who were never taught about safe sex, how to communicate with partners and never taught what their options were,” Narefsky said.
For pro-choice advocates like Narefsky, the pro-life movement has taken stances that are ultimately harmful to a woman’s ability to access essential health services.
“If you want to take a stance on pro-life, you need to actually take care of the people who are living, and I think that’s what members of Congress just don’t understand when they try and pass these laws saying that ‘Because I’m pro-life I want to defund Planned Parenthood.’ If women can’t get mammograms, that’s not being pro-life, that’s being anti-women,” Narefsky said.
Thomas directly countered the claim that denying women access to certain services makes pro-life advocates anti-women.
“Access to reproductive health has become sort of the symbol of the feminist movement. I think in doing that it turns anyone that’s pro-life into being anti-women, and that’s doing a huge injustice to women that don’t think the only answer is contraception or abortion,” Thomas said.

ALEXANDER BROWN/THE HOYAA university hotline has given neighbors an outlet for incidentsOver the last semester, administrators and neighbors alike have noticed lessening tensions between the two groups, with many crediting the Georgetown Community Partnership for channeling frustration into a productive setting.
“We ask the neighbors [if they see a change] periodically, and the answer is becoming more and more ‘yes,’” Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E Commissioner and Steering Committee Co-Chair Ron Lewis said. “There has been a change and it’s continuing to change.”
Neighbors have responded positively to the creation of a university helpline which residents are able to call 24/7 to address concerns, including complaints of noise violations.
“Now, you see that more neighbors are willing to get that callback … that way, they can be invested in the process,” Safety and Student Life Working Group Member Cody Cowan (SFS ’14) said.
In order to increase neighborhood engagement in university life, the Communications and Engagement Working Group has organized a series of events on campus. Last fall, the group organized a Neighbor Night, which gave neighbors the chance to participate in an on-campus panel discussion about Shakespeare before attending the Georgetown University Theater and Performance Studies’ performance of “Hamlet.” Two more Neighbor Nights are scheduled to occur this spring.
“There seems to be a heightened understanding on campus and in the community of activities that we can enjoy together, so we can spend time together and get to know each other better,” Co-Chair of the Communications and Engagement Working Group Tom Birch said.
“We have really learned that the university and the neighborhood are most effective when we are communicating freely with each other about what the real issues are and being transparent about the complexities,” Associate Vice President for Community Engagement and Strategic Initiatives Lauralyn Lee said.
Composed of university administrators, community leaders and student representatives, the partnership consists of a steering committee and five working groups that focus on specific issues in university-neighborhood relations including student life, safety and transportation.
“As time went on and we got to know each other, we realized we were all interested in the same thing: success and a better relationship and most importantly a quality of life that was good for the community and for the students on campus,” President of the Burleith Citizens Association and a member of the GCP Steering Committee Nan Bell said.
Georgetown University Student Association President and Steering Committee member Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) agreed that the GCP’s creation has facilitated greater dialogue among students, administrators and neighbors.
“It’s really hard to distrust and dislike somebody if you know them. What we saw before [the GCP] was a lot of back and forth rhetoric because students really didn’t understand who the neighbors were and where they were coming from,” Tisa said. “In the long term, if we could really build up those relationships on an individual level, a lot of the neighborhood tensions will diffuse over time.”
As one of the five working groups, the Safety and Student Life Working Group’s primary aim is to move social life on campus. To that end, the group has been responsible for initiating and supporting the removal of the one keg limit for on-campus parties and advanced registration for on-campus parties last year.
“The neighbors wanted the neighborhood to be more quiet, the students wanted an atmosphere on campus where parties were more welcome and the university wanted everyone to be happy,” Cowan said.
The Safety and Student Life Working Group has also aimed to create more transparency in the sanctions process so that students who are written up are able find out what their sanctions, or punishment, are within seven to 10 days of the event’s occurrence. Previously, the process took up to three weeks.
Although the university and the community agree that the GCP has made significant progress, student noise remains a particular concern of Georgetown neighborhood residents.
“Walking and talking at night makes noise. There’s nothing necessarily all that wrong with it, but it is a problem if it becomes disruptive,” Lee said.
Despite the persistence of the noise complaint, neighborhood residents who have not been actively engaged in the partnership have acknowledged the progress that the partnership has spurred.
While student representatives on the GCP are appointed through GUSA, Lee said that GCP will seek greater student involvement across all working groups through the creation of a more formal application process which will debut in February.
“We’re trying to make sure that there is always a formal student voice at the table, but also that that’s informed by broader outreach,” Lee said.
Tisa agreed that increased student participation is critical to the success of the working groups moving forward.
“In the working groups this year we’ve had increased student participation and that’s a long-term goal. It’s really important to have that kind of representation in terms of increasing that neighbor-student connection. We talk about things that we’re facing on campus and the neighbors talk about the way they see it. Usually we’ve found that there’s common ground on almost everything,” Tisa said.

New changes to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority will give Georgetown students increasing access to nearby Baltimore and Northern Virginia, albeit for an increased fee compared to current Metro fares.
In the coming year, transportation to and from Washington, D.C., will be transformed by the completion of the Silver Line and the introduction of weekend Maryland Area Regional Commuter train service to Baltimore, in addition to an increase in fees.
The construction of the new Silver Line, which will run from Largo Town Center in Prince George’s County Md to Wiehle Avenue in Fairfax County, Va., will extend the Metrorail to Dulles National Airport.
“The idea of extending the rail to Dulles has been contemplated for decades,” Metro spokesperson Dan Stessle said.
The project, whose construction is overseen by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, marks the first time in Metro history that a railroad will be constructed by an entity outside of the WMATA.
“It’ll benefit the whole region. Just like all of the Metro rail lines, it’ll be used by commuters, by leisure travelers, by people who are shopping at Tysons Corner or people who live in northern Virginia who want to go into the District or a Redskins game in Prince George’s County,” Stessle said.
Much of the infrastructure improvement will be funded by a proposed 3 percent metro fare increase slated to begin in July 2014 in accordance with a 2010 resolution by the Metro Board of Directors to increase Metro fares every two years in order to stay in line with inflation.
“We continue to believe that Metro is a great value, especially when you consider the cost of parking for commuters as well as the hassle traffic and the like,” Stessles said.
Tucker Cowden (MSB ’17), who takes the Metro to get to his internship on Capitol Hill, expressed concern over the Metro fare increases.
“I was definitely concerned because that’s kind of my go-to for my internship. It’s definitely something people consistently use because it’s the least expensive option, so the idea of it becoming more expensive is something that you have to consider on a daily basis if you’re going to be using the Metro under new fares,” Cowden said.
Abbey McNaughton (COL ’16), who also takes the Metro to her internship on the Hill, hoped the Metro fare increase might place added pressure on Georgetown to increase shuttle service for students going to Capitol Hill.
“I guess I would say that if Metro fees continue to increase, then hopefully Georgetown will take increasing [the number of] shuttles down Halfmore Hill a little more seriously,” she said.
Along with the construction underway for the Silver Line, Metro riders can expect to see ongoing weekend infrastructure improvements on several other lines, which involve replacing rail ties, fasteners and railroad pieces in order to make the railway safer and more reliable.
“It’s not sexy, and most people don’t quite fully understand what’s happening out there, but they know that every weekend we’re doing lots and lots of work,” Stessle said. “As we get through the critical work, we can start stepping that back and people will eventually see more normal weekend services with fewer disruptions and fewer track work impacts.”
In step with the new increase in public transportation options, the MARC Train, which offers service to Harford County, Md.; Baltimore City, Md; Washington D.C.; Brunswick, Md; Frederick, MDdand Martinsburg, W.va, will now offer weekend service on its Penn Line, easing access to Baltimore-Washington International Airport.
As of this spring, Georgetown students will also be able to enjoy new transportation in the neighborhood, with the opening of a new bike lane on M Street. The lane will complement the already existing bike lane in the opposite direction on L Street.
“For some people it may be their only option as far as moving around goes,” Communications Specialist in the District Department of Transportation Monica Hernandez said.
The new bike lane, funded through local and federal funds, has been in the works since 2005.

In this semester’s round of hiring for Students of Georgetown Inc., a group of students were chosen to join a Corp location that does not exist yet: Hilltoss.Hilltoss, a salad and smoothie shop slated to open within the Healey Family Student Center next fall, will be The Corp’s first new location since Hoya Snaxa and Midnight MUG in 2003.“The Corp wasn’t really looking to expand because we sort of cover a lot of the space on campus already, but when there was going to be a new space developed, it made a lot of sense,” Corp CEO Lizzy MacGill (COL ’14) said.Hilltoss Director Ellen Wilcox (COL ’14), who previously worked at Vital Vittles, said that the opening of the salad and smoothie shop would be impossible outside of the HFSC.“There’s not much room on campus, so unless we wanted to operate out of a closet, I’m not sure where else we would have gone,” Wilcox said.While their fellow new hires are working three shifts per week at Vital Vittles and More Uncommon Grounds, Hilltoss employees will be part of the store development process. This semester will consist mainly of training, which Hilltoss employees, who must each obtain a food handling license, will require more of than those at other Corp storefronts.The increased need for training and personnel prompted The Corp to hire a large number of students this semester, before the service opens.“It’s an operation we haven’t tried before, and it’s going to require a lot more personnel than any of our other services. And for a Corp service to hire a large number of people is very hard in terms of training; we are all full-time students,” Wilcox said.The service hired 14 employees this month, more than any other Corp service. New Hilltoss employees declined to comment for this article, citing instructions from Corp leadership.Hilltoss employees will table at the Georgetown University Farmers Market when it returns this spring, previewing eventual offerings by operating a station with salads, side items and drinks.“To be able to have healthy and affordable food is an interesting mix and it is something we are committed to — bringing quality ingredients to students, but all the while remembering that we are students and we can’t always pay high prices for food,” Wilcox said. Meanwhile, The Corp is struggling with the problems associated with opening a new location.“We are full time students here … and none of us have a background in any of this. So I think that is probably the biggest challenge at this point — navigating that process of the build-out itself,” MacGill said.However, the challenge of creating a new storefront will prove rewarding for Corp employees.“For us to take on a very serious, time-intensive, expensive project is actually terrifying, but also exciting,” MacGill said. “It’s just basically using the store as a new embodiment of Corp values: students serving students,” MacGill said.
