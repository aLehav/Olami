For over half a century, the School of Foreign Service and Carol Lancaster (SFS ’64) were intrinsically entwined. Among myriad notable alumni, Lancaster, who died Oct. 22 at the age of 72, shined as a dedicated public servant, academic and administrator who had an indelible impact on the school — and the world.
“Her passion for our university — for our students, their growth and our mission — was unparalleled, and we were all deeply fortunate to have had the chance to be in her presence. Carol will be missed in a most profound way by our entire Georgetown community,” University President John J. DeGioia wrote in a campus-wide email announcing her death Wednesday.
Lancaster resigned as dean of the School of Foreign Service in April, after taking a leave of absence following the discovery of a brain tumor in November 2013. Although doctors at the Georgetown University Medical Center removed the tumor in December, Lancaster entered hospice care in April.
“We were very grateful that we had as much time after her diagnosis as we did. She did fight this terribly, but it was a grim diagnosis from the start,” SFS Director of External Relations Gail Griffith (SFS ’72, GRD ’81), a friend of Lancaster’s, said. “I feel it was a great gift to have her as long as we did over the course of this summer, to spend time with her and have conversations with her that we treasure.”
After returning to the Hilltop nearly 20 years after her graduation from the SFS as a professor of politics in 1981, Lancaster would go on to serve as the director of the African Studies Program, the director of the Master of Science in Foreign Service Program and the director of the Mortara Center for International Studies, interspersed with a term as deputy director for the United States Agency for International Development during the Clinton Administration. She assumed the SFS deanship in 2010, after serving as interim dean the previous year. She was both the first woman and the first SFS graduate to serve as the school’s dean.
“Carol was this very energetic, imaginative, creative, forceful personality. And she really had multiple visions. She wanted to do so many things,” said Interim SFS Dean James Reardon-Anderson, who served as Lancaster’s senior associate dean. “She pursued them with great vigor and many of them really came to fruition and I think they are going to be with us for a very long time.”
Lancaster was born in Washington, D.C., a city that would prove to be inextricable from her personal narrative. Coming from a family of humble means, she was encouraged by her counselor at Oxon Hill High School to apply to Georgetown.
Upon graduating with a Bachelor of Science in foreign service, she won a Fulbright fellowship to La Paz, Bolivia.
“I think when she was in Bolivia, she was affected by the poverty and the living situation. She had a contribution to make in that field,” Griffith said.
She went on to earn her masters and doctoral degrees from the London School of Economics, where she met her first husband, Mehdi Ali, an Iraqi.
“She spent a lot of time in the Middle East as a newlywed, getting to know his family and travelling around,” Griffith said.
In addition to acquiring Arabic, the polyglot Lancaster developed an interest in the Middle East and Africa, on top of her passion for Latin America.
She returned to the United States in the 1970s, assuming various roles in government, including in congressional offices and in the Department of State during the Carter Administration.
“Carol Lancaster is one of those people who epitomized excellence day after day in government and in academia. Working in Congress, in the State Department, in [USAID] or in the classroom, she demonstrated a hard-nosed, fact-based practicality that turns good intentions into good results,” former Rep. David Obey (D-Wisc.), in whose office Lancaster worked, said in a statement to The Hoya. “Few people in the general public knew her name, but she has been one of those people who gives public service a good name. I learned a lot from her and very much regret her passing.”
Lancaster was a member of the State Department’s policy planning staff in the late 1970s, before serving as deputy assistant secretary of state for Africa from 1980 to 1981. She left government to join the Georgetown faculty in 1981, and would serve as director of the African Studies program later that decade.
Lancaster’s expertise lay in developmental economics, and she authored 10 books primarily focused on foreign aid.
“Dean Lancaster was a giant, not only here at Georgetown and as dean of the School of Foreign Service and everything she did preceding that, but she was a giant in the field of economic development, and particularly, politics, political science and political economy of development around the world with a lot of her work in recent years in sub-Saharan Africa,” said Steven Radelet, the Donald F. McHenry Chair in Global Human Development and director of the Global Human Development program.
While Lancaster’s tenure as dean was truncated by illness, she had planned to step down upon her term’s expiry in the summer of 2015, having instituted profound change and expansion.
“I had a very interesting phone call with her. Sometime before she announced she wouldn’t have another term as dean, we talked about whether she was in a position to finish as dean and go back to scholarship,” said Robert Gallucci, a distinguished professor in the practice of diplomacy and Lancaster’s predecessor as SFS dean. “I assured her that her contributions were so many and so important that she had paid her dues and that she could indeed go back to scholarship. It was not long after that when she was diagnosed, which I think is a tragic irony.”
Most significantly, these “dues” included the establishment of the master’s program in global human development and the foundation of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security.
“She had hoped for many, many years that Georgetown would play a leadership role in global women’s issues,” said GIWPS Executive Director Melanne Verveer (FLL ’66, GRD ’69), who as chief of staff for Hillary Rodham Clinton formed a friendship with then-USAID deputy director Lancaster. “She was hoping that it would be a place that would make a real contribution to advancing these issues in the world community, provide opportunities for research and related kinds of experience, create an academic program, that it would have a global platform that would put a focus on various aspects of women’s peace and security.”
Former Provost Jim O’Donnell said that the School of Foreign Service campus in Doha, Qatar, held a particular draw for Lancaster.
“The majority of our students in Doha are women from the Arab and Muslim world who have limited educational opportunities otherwise because their parents don’t want to send them abroad to study. And Carol was clearly very much animated and engaged by the opportunity we had there to provide the very best that Georgetown can do for some remarkably smart and promising young women,” he said.
Lancaster conceived and executed the Global Human Development program, aiming to train practitioners who would work on the ground in developing countries.
In April, the SFS Board of Visitors endowed the Carol Lancaster Scholarship to fund an entering graduate student in the GHD program. The board raised $128,000 in funds in “almost record time,” according to Griffith, the SFS director of external relations, and the first Lancaster scholar entered the program this semester.
In addition to these creations, Lancaster also oversaw the establishment of a master’s program in Asian Studies, in addition to more discreet administrative changes.
“It was mostly kind of hidden things that she did that meant a lot and mean a lot to this day and probably escape the attention of average people and sometimes faculty even aren’t aware of these things. She instituted regular consultations with the program directors. … In the past, that was always much more episodic,” SFS Faculty Chair Jeffrey Anderson, director of the BMW Center for German and European Studies, said. “She understood the complexities of this place; it’s a very decentralized place and that’s in many ways its strength but also you can imagine a decentralized place kind of flying apart over time, becoming less efficient, less connected. She has a knack for figuring out how to bring us together, even though we are all doing our own things within the school.”
Although Lancaster’s tenure as dean coincided with budget cuts as a result of the financial crisis, she maintained faculty growth, and the school continued to turn a profit.
The descriptors “energy,” “enthusiasm,” “passion” and “humor” were never absent from an account of the dean emerita.
“Carol was the dean of the SFS when I came, so in a real way, she taught me about the SFS and what its aspirations are and how it works and things like that,” said Provost Robert Groves, who joined Georgetown in August 2012. “As a new provost here, Carol was really wonderful in making me feel welcomed. She embodied the Georgetown spirit of community and care about the whole person instantly.”
Above all, Lancaster cherished her students, forming personal connections to both undergraduate and graduate students alike, facilitated by dinners and personal conversations.
“I think that oftentimes when you become part of a management team of a large and really highly respected program, you kind of lose touch with the individual students who make that program so special,” Lancaster’s son Doug Farrar (SFS ’05, GRD ’12) said. “I think that in her case she really maintained that personal connection and that intimate caring for her entire class of students through SFS. To me that was a major impact that I saw her have on students: that she really became close to these people and cared about their lives and their future beyond just in an academic setting.”
Farrar took a class co-taught by Lancaster and DeGioia on ethics in international development, two topics about which Lancaster was passionate.
“It was a large class and she — it was graded by TAs, so there was no conflict of interest there. And actually we had different last names so no one really knew that she was my mom except for my friends in my class,” Farrar said. “It was amazing to see her in her professional element, having mostly seen her as a mom. I think it reinforced the view that I had, which is that she was who she was, no matter whether she was teaching, parenting, being with friends. She had that same humorous personality and tremendous curiosity and intellect. And she brought that to every aspect of her life.”
Beyond the developing world, she also championed women at Georgetown, serving as a mentor to many and pushing for the advancement of women on the SFS faculty, colleagues said.
Her sense of humor was renowned, employed at various events and used to put visiting foreign delegations at ease.
“She would consistently point to us in the direction of comedy and politically engaged comedy,” said Davis Center for Performing Arts Artistic Director Derek Goldman, the co-director of the Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics, an initiative between the theater and performance studies department and the SFS. “And she really understood the medicine of laughter and the way that the campus — I think she saw a connection between what we were doing with the Lab and comedy and laughter, and the campus needed it.”
In addition to her duties as dean, Lancaster played the harp, fashioned jewelry and was working on three books, including a history of Washington, D.C. — a subject on which she taught a freshman proseminar — infused with her personal history. According to Griffith, a manuscript is complete, but its future is unclear.
Although Lancaster’s health was in rapid decline by this summer, she attended her son’s wedding in Dahlgren Chapel on July 26.
“The fact that she made it to my wedding was an incredible testament to her strength and resilience. And it was a really special moment for me and for my wife and for our family because it meant so much for me to have her there,” Farrar said.
Lancaster is survived by her husband of 34 years, Curt Farrar, son, four stepchildren, seven grandchildren and her daughter-in-law. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to the American Brain Tumor Association. A memorial will be held in Gaston Hall on Oct. 26 at 3 p.m.

Alumni are flooding the Hilltop for Homecoming Weekend, which began Thursday, for Saturday’s Homecoming football game and tailgate, moved from its usual spot in McDonough parking lot to the lawn between Regents Hall and the Rafik B. Hariri Building because of construction for the Intercollegiate Athletic Center.
In 2013, approximately 4,000 people made the trip to campus for Homecoming, an increase from the year before. The Office of Advancement declined to comment on donations or attendees for this year ahead of the weekend.
Traditions Day today will showcase the university’s history and traditions — particularly related to student clubs — on Copley Lawn. During the day, alumni can choose to sample from six classes with university professors, with topics such as “The Audacity to Innovate: Imagination and Creativity,” “We Have a Pope!: What’s New and What’s Traditional with Pope Francis” and “An Introduction to Bioethics.”
Ahead of the main festivities, many campus organizations, including the LGBTQ Center, the Women’s Center, Georgetown University Student Association, Students of Georgetown, Inc., New Student Orientation and The Hoya, are holding open houses and receptions for alumni.
Saturday’s tailgate, starting at 11 a.m., precedes the football team’s game against Bucknell University at 2 p.m., for which tickets must be purchased separately, at $10.
The tailgate costs $15 for students and $20 for alumni, and $25 for same-day entry. For those over 21, the entry fee includes free-flowing beer.
Rodrigo Mercado (MSB ’17) said that he will not be taking part in the Homecoming Tailgate because of its high cost for students under the age of 21.
“To be honest, I have other social plans that don’t require payment and I don’t want to pay money for an event geared toward students over 21,” Mercado said.
In the new location on Regents lawn, which the Homecoming website touts as providing “greater proximity to the MultiSport Facility” and as “at the center of the most recently-developed section of campus,” ’80s cover band Reflex will accompany the festivities.
Braden McDonald (COL ’14) a recent alumnus who lives in Calgary in Alberta, Canada, will be coming to Georgetown for Homecoming weekend and said that he knows that the weekend will be worth the eight-and-a-half-hour trip.
“It was a tough decision for me to come to Homecoming and I was a little hesitant. I thought well, on one hand, it’s quite hard for me personally, and on the other hand, it looks a little bit desperate,” McDonald said. “But then I heard about people coming from Dublin and Istanbul. Clearly, this is an un-missable opportunity, and I feel like recently graduated seniors really prioritize it, so I wanted to be part of it.”
McDonald said that he is eager to reconnect with his friends and spend a weekend at his alma mater.
“I’m looking forward to reliving my Georgetown life,” McDonald said. “I’ve transplanted myself to a very new life, I miss my old life very much, and I really want to rekindle that just being surrounded by the people that I love and enjoying a weekend with them.”

A group of protesters gathered outside the Sabra Hummus House pop-up shop on Wisconsin Avenue NW Monday evening to protest the company owners’ support of the Golani brigade of the Israeli army, in a demonstration organized by the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation.
In the intermittent rain, protesters gathered in front of the store around 6:30 p.m. carrying a large Palestinian flag and signs denouncing the store for supporting human rights violations in Palestine.
“Sabra supports the Gaza siege: let Gaza live … let Gaza breathe,” protestors chanted.
According to its website, Sabra is owned by PepsiCo, based in the U.S., and by the Strauss Group, an Israeli food company that has provided for the Golani Brigade, a fraction of Israel’s military. In addition to the Israeli military occupation of the Gaza Strip, the protesters also said that they were protesting the brigade’s “racist” T-shirts, one depicting a pregnant Muslim woman in cross hairs that read “1 shot, 2 kills,” according to the protest’s event description.
A spokesperson for the company told The New York Times in 2010 that Sabra had never contributed “hummus or anything else” to the Israeli military. Sabra faced similar pushback in 2010, when Palestinian students at Princeton and DePaul Universities protested the sale of Sabra hummus on their campuses.
“The company has no political positions or affiliations,” Sabra wrote in a comment.
In response to the protest, one customer showed his support for Israel by wearing an Israeli flag like a cape as he walked past the protesters on his way inside of the store. Ari Goldstein (COL ’18), a board member of the Georgetown Israel Alliance, said that the organization deliberately did not take any action to respond to the protest.
“GIA made a conscious decision not to stage a counter-protest on Tuesday because we are a proactive, not reactive, organization,” Goldstein said.
However, Goldstein disagreed with the aims of the protest and characterized it as divisive.
“I think the protest was short-sighted. It framed a complex conflict in black-and-white terms in which only Israel is at fault, which is neither a fair nor constructive assessment,” Goldstein said. “Not to mention the fact that boycotting a business just because it’s Israeli gets us nowhere closer to peace, mutual understanding or a two-state solution — it merely divides and antagonizes.”
Sarah Mink said that the demonstration was protesting against actions of the Israeli army and did not denounce the entire country or population.
“This isn’t anti-Israel, anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish. That’s a really common misconception that people have,” Mink said. “As a Jew, I’m really uncomfortable with Israel’s actions against human rights violations in Palestinian territories.”
GIA board member Josh Goldberg (COL ’17) also was uncomfortable with the protest, asking for students to support peaceful solutions instead.
“Israel is the only true democracy in the Middle East and therefore is an important strategic ally to the United States. Students should be aware of the current situation in the Middle East and do what they can to support a peaceful resolution,” Goldberg said.
Though Mink acknowledged the importance of peace talks, she noted that such solutions had failed in the past, requiring actions such as the protest.
“We’re of the mindset that all of the peace talks and negotiations don’t really work in diplomacy. Although we really believe in it, it is not necessarily what is going to bring about peace and end human rights violations,” Mink said.
Georgetown Students for Justice in Palestine could not be reached for comment by press time.
The Sabra Hummus House will be open through Oct. 26.

While Muslims in Syria kill women, children, elderly indiscriminately – up to 250,000 people and counting – we devote our anger on Israel for we are anti-Semites in sheep’s clothing.
While Muslims have killed up to one million in Sudan, and counting, we devote our anger on Israel for we are really just anti-Semites pretending we are humanitarians.
While Muslims in Mali have forced 500,000 (and counting) people into refugee status – as they have done in the past year – we devote our anger on Israel for we are anti-Semites pretending to be for social justice.
While Muslims kill off what remains of the ancient Hindu population in-and-around Pakistan we devote our anger on Israel for we are like the Germans during the 1930s – people who needed a convenient scapegoat to escape their own feelings of frustration.
While Muslims have wiped out all the Buddhists from their ancient homeland in Afghanistan we devote our anger on Israel for it’s easy to pick on Jews and we are shameless hypocrites engaging in man’s oldest prejudice, anti-Semitism, while pretending to be holier-than-thou.

In order to clarify my concerns, let’s take a look back in history to 1933 when Hitler rose to power and became Chancellor of Germany and the Nazis won a large number of seats in the German parliament. What followed was the notorious nationwide Nazi boycott targeting Jewish businesses and professionals directed by Nazi storm-troopers posting signs everywhere saying “Do not buy from Jews!” Widespread anti-Semitism mounted with the Nuremberg Laws in 1935 depriving Jews of their basic rights as citizens and banning them from all professional jobs in education, politics, academia and industry which escalated in severity ultimately concluding in the “Final Solution.”

“Israeli military occupation of the Gaza Strip”. The Hoya really needs to be more careful in fact checking, especially when dealing with such a sensitive issue. Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005. It no longer occupies the strip. A blockade? Perhaps. But definitely not an occupation anymore.

The Washington Post endorsed Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4) for D.C. Mayor in an editorial published last on Friday, Oct. 17.
“Neither councilmember David A. Catania (I-At Large) nor former council member Carol Schwartz comes close to Ms. Bowser in temperament, work ethic, ideas, policy understanding and balanced approach,” the Post wrote.
The Post criticized both Schwartz and Catania for their stances on education reform, calling Schwartz’s opposition to the move “wrong-headed,” and lambasting Catania for contrived policy.
“Instead of forging a meaningful collaboration with the city’s able schools chancellor, Kaya Henderson, [Catania] set out to pass a series of bills that were sure to capture headlines but would do little to improve schools,” the Post wrote.
The Post also pointed to the personalities of candidates, identifying Schwartz as a weak sentimentalist, Catania as a hothead and Bowser as tough but likeable.
“Those critical or jealous of Ms. Bowser have painted a caricature of a lightweight. That is not the tough politician we have come to know and admire in her seven years on the council. She strikes us as smart, capable and confident without being arrogant,” the Post wrote.
The editorial suggested that Bowser would better unite D.C. as per Mayor Gray’s “One City” motto because of her commitment to all sections of the D.C. population and her summer travel tour of major cities.
Joaquin McPeek, communications director for Bowser’s campaign, cited the endorsement as a sign of his candidate’s strength.
“We certainly welcome all endorsements and we feel that it provides additional momentum for our campaign,” McPeek said. “I just think it goes to show the broader narrative that she has been able to bring a large coalition of people together and get the support of so many throughout the District whether it’s the Post, labor or business.”
After unseating Mayor Vincent Gray in the Democratic primary last April, Bowser has consistently led the polls. However, recently emerged independent candidate David A. Catania (SFS ’90, LAW ’94) has closed in on Bowser’s lead in the past couple weeks, threatening the typical Democratic mayoral win.
“Usually, the Democratic nominee in the primary election is it, to the point that this next election is often a formality. This time we have someone running who has a shot,” said Hans Noel, an associate professor of government and specialist in national primary endorsements. “Having the endorsement right around this time is probably about the time when people are starting to pay attention.”
Associate professor of communication, culture and technology Diana Owen agreed that the endorsement would solidify Bowser’s place at the front of the race.
“I think that it’s basically a way of validating decisions that people have already come to,” Owen said. “And for some people, the fact that The Washington Post might be behind her, if they had any doubts about the fact that she would be effective or whether she would be a good leader or not, that might have pushed them a little over the edge, or, if they’ve already decided on her but were a little lukewarm, this gives them a little bit more of a reason to turn out at the polls.”
Noel, who studies national endorsements, explained that while political parties can make voters’ decisions easier in national elections, the same principles of party politics do not apply to local elections, especially in liberal-dominated D.C.
“The real tension in D.C. politics is in sort of reformers and establishment Democrats,” Noel said. “What I think a lot of voters are sort of counting on is that the Post and other entities like that will help them decide when this person’s a real reformer, if that’s what you want, or not. It’s just hard to know, because you can’t rely on broad, ideological brushes when everyone’s kind of in the same place.”
President Barack Obama and governors Terry McAuliffe of Virginia and Martin O’Malley of Maryland have also endorsed Bowser.
Owen said she believes that personal endorsements, such as that of President Obama, hold more weight in the digital age.
“I think with a personal endorsement, it’s kind of easier to take that forward in new media than it is to just say ‘Here’s a newspaper that’s written an editorial,’ when you have an actual personality and the president of the United States has stepped up in a local election,” Owen said. “If I was to pick between the two and I only had one to pick, I would take his personal endorsement over the newspaper endorsement any day.”

Georgetown’s annual security report released this month revealed seven reported cases of sexual assault — but these numbers reflect only a portion of cases reported, as the university has yet to conduct a more complete sexual assault climate survey, as is recommended by the White House.
The annual security report is distributed every year under the Clery Act, which mandates that all colleges and universities receiving federal financial aid share information about crime in the campus area. Data of on-campus crime comes from Georgetown University Police Department records, the Office of Student Conduct and campus security authorities. Public property statistics are collected from the Metropolitan Police Department or U.S. Park Police.
The document lists seven reported cases of sexual assault in 2013, an increase from five reported cases in 2012 but noticeably lower than the national rate of one in six women and one in 33 men being sexually assaulted in their lifetime, according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network. A 2012 study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control found that 19 percent of undergraduate women have experienced sexual assault since entering college. Since the statistics in Georgetown’s report include only sexual assaults reported by students, staff and faculty to GUPD, the Office of Student Conduct and the Title IX coordinators, Women’s Center Director Laura Kovach explained that the narrow definition did not capture the extent of the problem on campus.
“If you look at the definition of Clery, it states that a crime occurred on or near campus. It is a narrow definition, and when I see seven, I’m not surprised. These are reports that fit into that definition. So many students either choose to not disclose or if they do disclose, they contact a hotline or seek out support from Health Education, Counseling and Psychiatric Services, Women’s Center, LGBTQ, etc. We need to be thoughtful when looking at numbers,” Kovach wrote in an email. “Our Clery numbers are important but so are disclosures that happen in other spaces around campus and off campus. We need to look at the totality of disclosures and reports.”
Sexual assault is one of the most underreported crimes with 60 percent of cases going unreported, according to RAINN. Health Education Services Sexual Assault and Relationship Violence Services Coordinator Jen Schweer agreed that the Clery numbers do not accurately reflect the whole story at Georgetown and noted the need to include other sources to craft a complete picture.
“By definition, it doesn’t include assaults that occur off campus, while on spring break, while home over the summer, etc., even though these can be survivors who seek services on campus and/or their perpetrator is another Georgetown student,” Schweer wrote in an email. “This is why the information we get from places like Health Education Services, National College Health Assessment data, etc. is so critical, because it helps us get a fuller picture of what is being experienced by our students as a whole.”
The new White House Task Force to Protect Students From Sexual Assault, created in January 2014, recommends that universities conduct campus climate surveys to better assess the situation on their campuses. The surveys would determine the students’ knowledge of university policy, the number of students who have experienced sexual assault and more information to help improve campus responses to the issue.
Georgetown has not announced a plan to conduct a campus climate survey, but the administration said that it is closely following federal legislation and developments. Rutgers University was invited by the White House to pilot the sexual assault survey, and the Association of American Universities, a nonprofit organization, is leading the survey’s development.
“As a White House recommendation, a campus climate survey is one of many issues we are considering in terms of how to best engage our campus on this issue,” Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh wrote in an email. “We are closely following these developments to be sure that any climate survey we use at Georgetown is the best possible instrument to help us understand the prevalence of misconduct at Georgetown, what our students’ concerns are, and how effective our educational programming is.”
Georgetown University Student Association President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said that a climate survey is essential to assess the culture of the campus with relation to sexual assault.
“[A campus climate survey] provides the best snapshot of the culture at Georgetown and maybe indications of underreporting because that is still an issue that we suffer from. A campus climate survey at one end can gather students’ knowledge about issues of sexual assault and understand how they are approaching the issue, but it could also be very indicative and point out holes in our current reporting procedures,” Tezel said.
GUSA Secretary for Health and Safety Nora West (SFS ’15) added that the campus climate survey will also help ensure that Georgetown provides the best resources and support to survivors of sexual assault.
“In order to create better programs and networks that support survivors, we need to have a better understanding of the situation on campus for survivors of sexual assault,” West said.
As the White House continues its push for campus climate surveys nationwide, student leaders plan to continue advocating for a campus climate survey at Georgetown.
“Things move slowly here, and with any bureaucracy it involves the continued and sustained pressure of student advocates on this issue in order for it to follow through,” Tezel said.

The D.C. Department of Health classified synthetic cannabinoids as a Schedule I drug Oct. 15, subjecting possession and sale of the drug to stricter punishments.
The federal government banned synthetic marijuana, colloquially known as K2 or Spice, three years ago. Despite this, companies producing the drugs have found it relatively easy to avoid prosecution by slightly changing the chemical structure of their compound or labeling it as a harmless substance. The drugs are often falsely marketed as potpourri, incense, jewelry cleaner or bath salts and are sold in gas stations and corner stores.
The new regulations established by the DOH make this practice more difficult, preventing chemists from altering the substance and skirting the law. The DOH has also allowed authorities to fine and retract the licenses of establishments selling the synthetic products.
This new Schedule I classification places synthetic marijuana alongside drugs like heroin and cocaine.
“In an effort to curb emerging synthetic drugs and protect children and teens, the District has developed one of the most comprehensive bans on harmful synthetic drugs,” DOH Director Joxel Garcia said in a press release last Wednesday.
The D.C. DOH also launched an anti-synthetic marijuana ad campaign, called K2 Zombie D.C. This campaign, targeted at young people, associates the drug with paranoia, seizures and hallucinations.
Other synthetic designer drugs like Molly, a pure form of ecstasy, and bath salts have both seen an increase in use among young people.
“These substances are gaining increased prevalence among youth and unsuspecting adults,” Garcia said. “We must be diligent and proactive if we are to stop the flow of harmful drugs to the marketplace and finding its way to our children.”
The substance’s ability to go undetected by conventional drug tests has contributed to higher usage of it in institutions with frequent drug testing.
“It is not out of the ordinary to hear reports of law enforcement officers or military personnel who test positive for synthetic marijuana,” Drug Policy Alliance spokesperson Grant Smith said. “You have the demand for synthetic marijuana being driven in part by the criminalization of marijuana.”
Smith agreed that synthetic marijuana is a threatening substance, particularly because of the lack of information about the substances.
“We don’t really know what the risks are,” Smith said. “We have very little understanding of what is in these products, or their effect on the user.”
These synthetic substances have the potential to be 1,000 times stronger than traditional marijuana, with effects more akin to psychotic breaks than a high.
One Georgetown freshman, who requested anonymity, said that while he and his friends often smoke marijuana, they have only encountered synthetic marijuana once. After beginning to smoke the substance, they quickly realized that it was not real and stopped.
“They smoked enough to definitely feel what they would say was a buzz,” this freshman said of his friends. “But it was different than the high you get from smoking marijuana.”
Despite the effects, Smith argued that criminalizing this substance would not fix the problem of usage in the United States.
“First and foremost, this should be treated as a health issue and not a criminal justice issue,” he said. “This is a more reasonable approach with better results than criminalizing it outright … this is a process where you let science decide what is the best way to deal with this substance, rather than having politicians decide.”
In the Nov. 4 general election, D.C. voters will choose whether to legalize marijuana for recreational use. The measure, expected to pass, will allow a person 21 years or older to legally possess up to two ounces of marijuana for personal consumption.
Smith believes that marijuana legalization would lead to a decline in synthetic marijuana use, as people would turn toward the regulated, safer product.
“The interest in synthetic marijuana could be mitigated by creating a market for marijuana,” he said. “That would diminish interest, and it’s a win for public health and safety.”

John Neffinger, media and communications strategist, will take over Ron Klain’s (CAS ’83) government seminar “Presidential Debates,” after Klain was appointed the U.S. Ebola czar by President Obama.
“I’d like to congratulate you on picking a professor as able as Ron Klain. Unfortunately for the class, but fortunately for the country, President Obama also recognizes his ability and so we have to re-calibrate a bit on the course. We’re saved by the fact that John Neffinger has generously agreed to step in and take over, putting us on track to continue with a great class,” Michael Bailey, professor and chair of the government department, wrote in an email to the 21 students in Klain’s class on Wednesday.
Neffinger is the president of The Franklin Forum, a nonprofit communications organization that provides media training and debate preparation for progressive candidates and nonprofit advocacy organizations. He co-founded KNP Communications, where he helped clients to develop effective communications skills.
He co-authored “Compelling People: The Hidden Qualities That Make Us Influential” with his partner Matt Kohut, and he has lectured at Harvard Business School and Columbia Business School. Neffinger has earned degrees from Harvard and Columbia Law School.
“I’m particularly pleased that John has such deep experience in preparing candidates for debates. This means he has lived the often harrowing process of debate preparation many times over which will give him particular insight into the presidential debates you are studying in the class,” Bailey wrote in his email.
According to Bailey’s email, the course will continue as originally planned on the syllabus, and the class will continue to meet on Monday evenings.
There will be an outside speaker this Monday, and Neffinger will begin teaching Nov. 3.
After news broke of Klain’s appointment to coordinate the United States’ Ebola response last Friday, Klain discussed the future of the course with his students during Monday night’s class session.
“When the president called, giving up this class was one of the top things on my mind,” Klain said to his students Monday.
Students in the class lamented the loss of Klain as their professor. Klain, a former chief of staff to vice presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden, has taught this course on and off since spring 2012.
Parnia Zahedi (COL ’15) said that Klain has been one of her favorite professors at Georgetown.
“He was one of the most impactful professors I’ve had at Georgetown,” she said. “He cared so much not only within those Monday night sessions but outside of the classroom as well.”
She attributed much of the course’s success to Klain’s dynamism and enthusiasm for the material.
“He would make class so fun, between giving us a chance to negotiate debates ourselves, to role playing different debates, so I’ll really miss how interactive he made the entire experience of being a student,” Zahedi said.
Klain’s students particularly praised him for his accessibility. According to Zahedi, Klain often ate dinner with groups of students at The Tombs before class, encouraged students to come to his office hours, and invited his students to come to his office in DuPont Circle if they ever wanted to meet with him.
“It’s astonishing how incredibly accessible he is. First day, he just gives out all his contact information to his students,” Dan Marrow (COL ’15), another student in his class, said.
Marrow explained that Klain designed the course himself and then chose to teach it at Georgetown so that he could teach at his alma mater.
“This is a class that he built, he chose to teach here, and you can tell he really loves being over here,” Marrow said.
Marrow and Zahedi said that Klain expressed interest in reconnecting with his students, either individually or as a class, after the course is over to reflect on the material together.

After receiving criticism for indefinitely postponing a College Democrats screening of “Milk,” which chronicles the life of the United States’ first openly gay politician, the Catholic University of America has rescheduled the event.
University spokesman Victor Nakas said that the Office of Campus Activities approved the event, originally scheduled for Oct. 1, after a discussion with the CUA College Democrats.
“Following a discussion and review of the program’s education intent, the director of campus activities approved the rescheduling of the event,” Nakas wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The College Democrats indicated that they will attempt to reschedule the program so that it takes place within the next month.”
The university said it originally postponed the screening because of a miscommunication between the administration and the College Democrats as to the nature of the event. According to a statement from CUA spokesperson Victor Nakas after the cancellation, the administrators were confused by the event’s advertising, believing it to be an event centered on advocacy, rather than on LGBTQ awareness.
The College Democrats had distributed flyers, which had been approved at the time of the event, on campus advertising for the event that read, “Kick off LGBT Awareness Month with The CUA College Democrats.”
“When the request for approval had first been submitted by the College Democrats to the Office of Campus Activities, there had been no indications that the program would be a kickoff to LGBT Awareness Month. On Sept. 30, the Office of the Dean of Students was made aware of the advertising. For university administrators it called into question whether the event had changed in nature from one of education to one of advocacy,” said an Oct. 2 from CUA said.
Though no date has been set for the event yet, CUA’s College Democrats Communications Director sophomore Jackson Tovar said that no changes were made to the content of the original event.
“The event that was approved was the same event that was approved in September,” Tovar wrote in an email.
Tovar emphasized that the event was never meant to be one of advocacy.
“The university thought that the screening had switched from being an event of awareness to an event of advocacy, which was not the case,” he said.
As was planned for the original screening, the rescheduled event will feature introductory speeches by CUA alum Kevin Walling, the first openly gay chair of the Democratic Party in Montgomery County, Md., and CUA professor of politics, John Whyte, followed by a screening of “Milk,” in which Sean Penn plays Harvey Milk, an openly gay politician who served as a San Francisco supervisor until his assassination in 1978.
Because the university did not propose a later date for the event, students assumed the event was cancelled.
“We were all really confused about why the event was cancelled. To me, postponing means there is a later date. Since there was no later date, I considered the event to be cancelled,” Tovar said.
University officials said they never intended to cancel the event altogether.
“Given the confusion caused by the advertising, the Office of the Dean of Students contacted the College Democrats to postpone the event,” the Oct. 2 statement read. “It is our expectation that it will be rescheduled for later in October.”
Robert Mejia, a junior at Catholic University, said that students were surprised and unhappy that the university originally cancelled the event.
“I can’t speak for the whole student body, but we discussed the cancellation in one of my classes, and a few students seemed upset that the university suddenly cancelled the event when it had just been approved,” Mejia said.

The Academic Resource Center and the Office of the Provost are sponsoring the university’s first Disability Cultural Month throughout October and through Nov. 13, which features events, panel discussions and a performance that will focus on disability and diversity awareness.
Lydia Brown (COL ’15), who was on the month’s planning committee, said that she hopes the month will encourage the student body to think differently about disability.
“What we hope to do through the events of Disability Cultural Month is not only to highlight the diverse experiences of disabled people, even within that category of disability, but also to highlight how it is incumbent upon us, intellectually, socially and even ethically, to shift the way we think about disabilities.” Brown said. “We need to shift from this pathological context that disability means something wrong with you to be fixed medically or psychiatrically, to the context of diversity and social justice in keeping with the values of our Jesuit university.”
Chris DeLorenzo (GRD ’17), another student on Disability Cultural Month’s planning committee, expressed the importance of bringing disability to the forefront of campus discussion.
“The broader question that we are trying to address with this month, is simply putting disability on the radar screen,” DeLorenzo said. “Putting it on the radar screen as a diversity issue, rather than a medical problem that should be dealt with as little as possible and out of sight of everyone else.”
Many of this month’s events will address ableism, or prejudice against disabled people.
“Ableism is basically the system of pressure that values certain kinds of bodies and minds over other kinds of bodies and minds,” Brown said. “And in particular, those that are considered not desirable or not valuable bodies and minds are the one that we consider disabled. So our lives are considered less worth living. Our existences are considered burdensome in some societies. … Ableism underpins everything.”
Holahan said that the month aims to educate a wider group of students about disability’s place in conversations about diversity.
“What we are really trying to do is that we are trying to look at opportunities to educate the general community,” Holahan said. “We are trying to look at things that will be really important for students to gain lessons or insights of what it means to have disabilities, of what it means to request accommodations, of what it means to have equal access to programs and facilities.”
Brown said that events that address disability often attract fewer students than events related to other cultural groups.
“For a lot of people, it takes seeing something else in the title or description of the event or hearing about it from someone who they already have a relationship with to consider ‘maybe I should go to that,’” Brown said. “Because, for most people, if it’s just about disability, it doesn’t strike a chord in them that I might want to attend that.”
According to DeLorenzo, the student committee tried to address this problem by connecting disability events to other popular groups such as the Georgetown University Lecture Fund, the Black House, Leaders in Education about Diversity, Black Student Alliance and Center for Social Justice.
The month will also feature a performance of “Broken Bodies, PBP: Police Brutality Profiling,” a spoken-word and hip-hop performance by Krip-Hop Nation, a project that features musicians with disabilities. This performance, as well as other talks that are a part of of Lecture and Performance Series on Disability Justice, focuses on the intersectionality of disability issues.
According to Holahan, about 20 students attended the month’s first event about student-run nonprofits.
“Could there be more? Absolutely. But … if only one person shows up,” Holahan said, “that one person was passionate about learning about disability issues.”
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Office of the President is not funding Disability Cultural Month. The Office of the President is providing both funding and promotional support for Disability Cultural Month.

The Georgetown University Library Associates collaborated with the English department to present “Georgetown Writes,” the first in a series of panels featuring alumni discussing their experiences in the literary, film and magazine worlds, on Tuesday in Lohrfink Auditorium.
The panel was composed of University of North Carolina School of the Arts Chancellor Lindsay Bierman (CAS ’87), Harvard University screenwriting professor Mark Poirier (CAS ’91) and Christopher Reich (SFS ’83), who is the author of the New York Times bestseller “Numbered Account.” University Librarian Artemis G. Kirk moderated the discussion.
The discussion began as each writer addressed the challenges that they faced in their specific fields.
Reich started producing novels after giving up an unsuccessful career in stock brokering and investment banking.
“When I was at Georgetown I would have never ever dreamt that I was going to end up as a novelist,” Reich said. “I was in the SFS studying economics, doing my best to get through. … I’ve written ten books and I’m either proud or ashamed to say I never took one English class in college.”
Poirier also discovered his interest in writing later on, switching from the pre-med track to English during his junior year.
“People learn as much about writing in a physics class … as you can in a writing class,” Poirier said. “At Georgetown you get a broad liberal education and I can’t think of better preparation for a writer than that.”
Regardless of their somewhat untraditional paths to their current careers, all three professionals spoke about their deep and lifelong love of reading.
“I am a huge believer in learning,” Reich said. “My fondest memories are of being on the fifth floor of Lauinger looking out over the leaves and just reading a book for four hours at a time. … The reason I can write the kind of books I have is because I learned so much here.”
When questioned by the audience about how the digital age will influence the publishing industry, Bierman expressed his belief that printed books will continue to be prevalent, even in a society that is reliant on technology.
“Print is a lean back experience, digital is a lean forward experience,” Bierman said. “There is a different mindset and I think that that lean back experience is always going to be with us. … What we discovered through our research is that people just want both. They want to be able to have the convenience of looking up a recipe on their tablet in the kitchen but it would actually enhance the likelihood that they would renew their subscription if they could have the tablet and the print addition both.”
The writers also shared their advice and experience with the aspiring writers in the crowd. Bierman provided tips for two obstacles he said he often faces: writer’s block and procrastination.
“I think that discipline is the hardest thing of all to maintain,” Bierman said. “You have to really separate yourself from the world in a very deliberate way in order to get into that state of flow and to avoid the kinds of distractions that all of us have today. That’s what creates great art.”
Reich and Poirier said they felt fortunate to create and share stories as a way to make a living and spoke to the pleasure they found in seeking out a story as well as their individual processes and techniques.
“For me, my great joy in writing is the two or three months a year I have where I can go around the world and research on whatever story I’m doing and get out there and pretend I’m some kind of investigative journalist,” Reich said. “The hard part is when you come back and open your door and look at that desk and say ‘Oh my God, I’m going to be there for the next nine months,’ but that’s how you earn a living.”
Poirier said that he loves to travel in search of stories, and often spends the day listening to the conversations of strangers.
“I think going to places is important because you will notice details you can’t see online.” Poirier said. “I do a lot of reading and observing. I’m the one on the subway who misses his stop because he’s fascinated by these two teenage girls who are talking about where they’re going to score some meth.”
Kate Randazzo (SFS ’17) attended the event and said that she enjoyed hearing a variety of perspectives from professionals in the field.
“I really thought the panel was effective at having a diverse group of voices; all the writers were coming from different places and because of that they all had different advice to offer,” Randazzo said. “I liked the variety of perspectives.”
Elizabeth Biener (SFS ’17) said that although she enjoyed the event, she wished there would have been a speaker present who had studied to be a writer while at Georgetown.
“One perspective that I think was lacking is the person at Georgetown that always wants to be a writer,” Biener said.“All three panelists didn’t think they would be a writer and then became one.”

The D.C. Schools Project celebrated its 30th anniversary with a panel discussion in the ICC Auditorium on Thursday about the impact of the project on the Washington, D.C. immigrant community and the current condition of education in D.C.
D.C. Schools Project, under the umbrella of the Center for Social Justice, recruits Georgetown students to teach English as a second language to the District’s underprivileged youth and adults with immigrant backgrounds, aiming to improve literacy and give tutors a better understanding of their surrounding communities.
The event began with a welcome message from Olivia Ball (COL ’15), the Latin American Youth Center Program Coordinator of the D.C. Schools Project, who has worked with the organization since the first semester of her freshman year.
“If I could spend every day at the Latin American Youth Center, I would,” Ball said. “I can’t imagine what my Georgetown experience would’ve been like without working for D.C. Schools. It’s also inspired me to continue pursuing a career in education post-graduation.”
Douglas Reed, an associate professor of government, moderated the panel, which included an official introduction and report about the current state of the organization from D.C. Schools Program Director Jessica Lee.
The three “narratives from the field,” given by Language Access and Advocacy Coordinator in the Office of Latino Affairs Cecilia Castillo Ayometzi (GRD ’97), Director of Language Acquisition Division of D.C. Public Schools Elba Garcia, and Staff Attorney of the Capital Area Immigrants’ Rights Coalition Ursela Groat (SFS ’11), explored the impact D.C. Schools and similar programs can have and the relationship of their current work to D.C. Schools and Georgetown.
“I always wanted to understand my migration experience; what it meant to be a migrant in my society,” Ayometzi said. “Success is that they pay you to do what you love to do, and I think that I have managed to accomplish that.”
The panelists discussed how the environment in which the project is active has both changed and stayed constant, pointing to the surge of unaccompanied youth into the area
“The population continues to be predominantly Hispanic,” Garcia said.
“Now we have more diversity,” Ayometzi added. “The new population is very young.”
Groat said that she was heavily influenced by her own experience working as a tutor in the parent program of D.C. Schools as a student at Georgetown.
“I loved being there every Saturday, I loved seeing the students and I loved the work that we were doing,” Groat said. “It gave me the opportunity to understand what it meant to be an undocumented immigrant in this country.”
Before an informal celebration at Epicurean and Company, the panel concluded with comments by CSJ Associate Director Ray Shiu.
“I know firsthand how projects like D.C. Schools Project can mean so much in advancing educational opportunities for English language learners,” he said.
Tutor Chris Yang (SFS ’18) attended the panel and, as a first -generation immigrant, connected with the idea of giving back expressed in the panel.
“I wanted to give back, in a sense, and help other people,” Yang said.
Jenny Liang (COL ’18), who also tutors, noted the emphasis of the programs such as D.C. Schools at the university.
“Community service is a central part of the curriculum here at Georgetown,” Liang said. “Georgetown puts a very strong focus on reaching out to local communities.”

With Mayor Vincent Gray’s plan to close D.C. General, the District’s largest homeless shelter, within the next year, leading mayoral candidates Muriel Bowser, David Catania and Carol Schwartz have proposed differing policy plans to accommodate the city’s homeless population after the shelter’s closure.
The city’s largest shelter is located in the space formerly occupied by D.C. General Hospital. The facility has already seen 40 rooms closed after being deemed unsafe, and the shelter’s budget is $10 million short from what it needs to house the homeless, The Washington Post reported. Fox 5 D.C. reported in May that the shelter’s rooms contained rodents and rust, and the showers were lined with mildew.
The plan to close the city’s largest shelter has raised questions about how to accommodate the District’s homeless population without D.C. General, especially in light of the expected 16 percent increase in homeless families this winter.
Democratic candidate and front-runner Muriel Bowser has voiced her support for Gray’s plan to close the shelter. To bridge the gap until new shelters can be built, Bowser would expand the city’s rapid rehousing program. However, Bowser’s Campaign Communications Director Joaquin McPeek noted that Bowser’s focus would be on reducing the need for such shelters in the first place, allowing the city to persist through the loss of the shelter.
“In working to produce more affordable and subsidized housing as well as implementing additional prevention services, as mayor, Muriel’s goal will be to lesson the number of families and individuals in need of shelter. Muriel is committed to finding long-term solutions for would-be homeless families and individuals before turning to a shelter, developing smaller shelter alternatives, and, ultimately, closing D.C. General,” McPeek said.
Ad:
Dora Taylor, spokesperson with the D.C. Department of Human Service, agreed, saying that the existence of smaller, community-oriented shelters can be beneficial.
“Children should be able to stay at their neighborhood school, so it’s always ideal to keep families in the community rather than isolated in some place,” Taylor said.
According to The Washington Post, independent candidate David Catania (SFS ’90, LAW ’94), in contrast, asserted that D.C. General should stay open, focusing instead on improving facilities. Catania has also focused on reducing homelessness overall by using increased rent subsidy programs to make housing more affordable.
“[Catania’s plan will] identify programs and policies that are not working, improve them, or reinvest those resources in more effective programs,” the candidate’s official campaign pamphlet, published Sept. 14, said.
Independent candidate Carol Schwartz has argued for remodelling D.C. General or building a new facility after the upcoming winter, hoping to use assistance programs to bridge the gap until then.
“Instead of waiting on construction, Carol will increase funding for tenant-based assistance programs,” reads Schwartz’s Affordable Housing Position Paper.
D.C. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Dora Taylor stressed the department’s support of the mayor’s plan to close the facility, but also pointed to the importance of drawing attention to smaller neighborhood shelters to provide for the city’s homeless population.
“We absolutely think that D.C. General should be closed. We stand in support of the mayor’s decision to close it,” Taylor said. “We are trying to inform the community and raise awareness that there are already neighborhood- based shelters that people don’t even know about. They don’t know about them because there isn’t the kind of traffic and activities going on that people associate with homelessness.”
However, the department has fielded concerns from community members about the influx of community shelters into neighborhoods around the city.
“I hope that we are able to convince people that [allowing shelters in their neighborhoods is] the humane thing to do, and if anything, its value added to communities because we stabilize people in a better fashion when they’re able to stay in their community,” Taylor said.

Teach For America put Georgetown University in the top 20 in the list of medium-sized universities contributing the most alumni to the program for the seventh year in a row.
Georgetown ranked seventh with 27 alumni behind two D.C. area schools, Howard University and the George Washington University, which contributed 40 and 35, respectively. This is a drop in position from 2013, when Georgetown was in fourth place with 40 alumni.
Georgetown’s 27 alumni will join 10,600 Teach For America members teaching in 50 urban and rural regions across the country. Since 1991, almost 500 Georgetown alumni have joined the program.
“Teach For America works in partnership with communities to expand educational opportunity for children facing the challenges of poverty,” Teach For America Manager of Communications Elora Tocci said.“Teach For America recruits and develops a diverse corps of outstanding college graduates and professionals to make an initial two-year commitment to teach in high-need schools and become lifelong leaders in the movement to end educational inequity.”
Established in 1990, Teach For America has committed itself to eliminating educational inequality in local communities across the United States. Since then, more than 33,000 participants have reached over 3 million children.
According to Teach For America Recruitment Manager Weston Fillman, the program goes beyond the activities of simple community service through intense engagement between teachers and students.
“We provide intensive training, support and career development that helps these leaders increase their impact and deepen their understanding of what it takes to provide an excellent education to our most underserved kids,” Fillman said.
Georgetown graduates have been particularly engaged in this cause because it aligns with the university’s overall goals and its Jesuit mission.
“Georgetown students and alumni have a real passion for service,” Tocci said. “The fact that so many Hoyas join Teach For America is a testament to their commitment to social justice and desire to make our country more equitable for kids facing the challenges of poverty.”
Teach For America has faced criticism in the past for “padding the resumes” of college graduates before they apply to jobs in their desired field. According to Fillman, this criticism is unfounded, since 90 percent of Teach For America alumni are working in education or with low-income communities today.
“TFA seeks individuals who are looking to solve the problems facing America’s public school systems and it starts in the classroom and emerges from there,” Fillman said. “We believe in the collective action of many people, in every community and in every field fighting against educational injustice and to tackle large issues of systemic racism and poverty.”
Kelly O’Keefe (SFS ’15) was accepted to Teach For America the spring semester of her junior year and now serves as a campus campaign organizer for the organization. O’Keefe will tentatively teach high school mathematics in Baltimore, Md., during the 2015-2016 academic year.
According to O’Keefe, Georgetown students are naturally drawn to the program due to the values taught on campus.
“I think it definitely has a lot to do with Georgetown’s Jesuit values,” O’Keefe said. “At Georgetown, we are taught a lot about how to be men and women for others and our world class education can be used to further our careers, but can also be used to help other people.”
O’Keefe said that the abundance of community service programs for students to take part in creates a culture of giving, propelling people toward Teach For America.
“I think that especially through programs like D.C. Reads, D.C. Schools, Prison Outreach and Jumpstart, Georgetown has countless programs that are focused on education quality,” O’Keefe said. “For a lot of people, Teach for America is a very appropriate culmination of their four years at Georgetown.”

The university’s recent consideration of a third-year meal plan requirement brought to light many concerns with on-campus dining — long lines, limited options and crowded dining halls among them.
Another concern related to requiring students to frequent the same dining establishment for another year at Georgetown was the university’s enforcement of Title IX no-contact directives, which prohibit individuals who are accused of sexual harassment or sexual assault from making direct contact with the survivors of their crimes.
The Georgetown University Police Department and the Office of Student Conduct have the ability to issue a no-contact directive under Title IX, but these restrictions can be difficult to enforce on Georgetown’s small campus.
“When you have areas that become necessary spots on campus, whether that be academic buildings, academic lounges, dining halls, etc., it creates a difficult situation in order to be able to enforce these orders, so it becomes incumbent upon that school or university in the context of its ability to expand and provide more options for its students to ensure that there are ample facilities to accommodate a no-contact directive,” Georgetown University Student Association President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said.
The no-contact directives serve to prevent the survivor from coming into both direct and indirect contact with the accused perpetrator.
“Seeing someone who has perpetrated a crime like that can be incredibly triggering for an individual — meaning they experience emotions related to the specific incident or the feelings that followed in the aftermath. This is an incredibly distressing and painful experience,” Health Education Services Staff Clinician and Sexual Assault Specialist Bridget Sherry Laizer wrote in an email. “The knowledge that someone is forbidden to contact you gives some peace of mind to a survivor, knowing that there will be real consequences that follow a violation of a no-contact directive.”
The no-contact directives are not limited to Georgetown’s campus and include all forms of communication.
“Normally the directive addresses initiated actions by students subject to the no-contact directive, such as stalking, phone calls, texting, email, etc.,” Georgetown University Police Department Chief of Police Jay Gruber wrote in an email. “In instances where students inadvertently run into each other, they are expected to maintain civility and keep their distance from each other.”
Universities and colleges across the country have been taking a second look at their Title IX policies after the Department of Education began its detailed Title IX investigations of over 75 colleges and universities this past year in order to ensure that the schools are complying under the law’s regulations.
Offices like Health Education Services work with survivors to ensure that they receive the necessary accommodations after their traumatic experience.
“We also let them know of accommodations that are available through university housing, academics, and other resources on campus,” Laizer wrote. “We work closely with all of these different offices to arrange for any accommodations a student might need.”
In the event that the accuser fails to comply with no-contact directives, the violation may be adjudicated with the Office of Student Conduct and could result in suspension or expulsion.
In addition, the Georgetown University Police Department also enforces District of Columbia Civil Protection Orders that students, faculty and staff have issued in the city. These civil protection orders are easily adjustable to the university environment.
“They can be easily modified and adjusted for your specific case. For example, the space between you and the accuser in classes could be reduced from 50 feet to seven feet. Instead of having absolutely no recourse, you can have it be adjustable to a university setting,” Sexual Assault Peer Educator Chandini Jha (COL ’16) said.
According to GUSA Vice President Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15), GUSA representatives have only discussed the no-contact directive with university administrators in the context of the proposed third-year meal plan mandate, but they plan to bring up the issue again in the future.
“It’s a really important part of any work that Georgetown does about sexual assault and it’s really at the forefront of all the discussions,” Jikaria said. “[The university needs to] make sure that they’re not putting any survivors of sexual assault in places where they’re in contact with the perpetrator. Any kind of hostile environment should be avoided in general.”

The Georgetown University Student Association expanded its “What’s A Hoya?” Initiative, which is in its second year, by adding discussion sections after the presentations and increasing the number of student participants.
The program, designed by students, administrators, faculty and resource centers, provides freshmen with information and advice on different aspects of life on campus. The topics for each presentation this year are the same as last year, and cover
“Mentorship,” “Cura Personalis” and “Community in Diversity.”
According to GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff and “What’s A Hoya?” Senior Coordinator Megan Murday (SFS ’15), the planning team decided to keep the three topics static because they reflect Georgetown’s Jesuit identity.
“When we picked these last year we were looking at what Jesuit values are central to our identity as a university and we picked those three,” Murday said.
Each session is around 90 minutes long and includes presentations, student panels and an added feature, student discussion groups. Students who participate in the program will receive additional points toward housing selection in the spring. In order to receive credit, students must attend one or more sessions and complete a post-program reflection. Each session that a student attends awards him or her a 0.10 increase in housing points.
According to Murday, students who participated in the program last year expressed a desire for group discussion.
“[Students said the] most engaging one was the ‘Community and Diversity’ module because it was more of a conversation and a discussion,” Murday said, “It was more intimate instead of just a lecture style.”
In response, GUSA incorporated time for smaller discussion sections led by student leaders and professionals in the topic.
According to Murday, these smaller groups allow students to air their opinions more freely and learn from their peers.
“The idea behind the program is to give freshman students access to the resources, to the discussions that happen on campus but don’t get the air time, aren’t as popular maybe as some of the other things that we have access to all the time,” Murday said. “We are hoping that it is more of a conversation and that students can start to build relationships with those people that can help them throughout their time at Georgetown.”
Olivia Gasser (COL ’18) attended the mentorship-themed session and small group discussion.
“My small group touched upon spiritual mentorship and not until then had I really realized how much of an impact a spiritual mentor can have on somebody,” Gasser said. “My discussion leader was a great example of how much a spiritual mentor can support and influence somebody.”
According to Murday, the team of seven coordinators selected students leaders that had peer mentorship experience and were representative of different groups within the campus community to serve as mentors.
Brianne Griffith (COL ’18) also attended the mentorship session and said that she enjoyed meeting with older peer mentors.
“Freshman need to get themselves more involved in the job search so they are more comfortable for junior and senior year and finding a mentor is a great way to do that, which this program really showcased,” Griffith said,
According to Murday, about 700 freshmen signed up for the first mentorship-themed session. Last year, attendance at all three modules combined was somewhere between 500 and 600 students.
“We’ve had speakers that spoke last year and then came to this module this academic year and have said they have also appreciated it being more dynamic and more of a conversation,” Murday said. “I think it’s been much more successful this year.”
Murday said feedback from this year’s programming has been positive thus far.
“A lot of speakers have told me that students have stayed afterwards to ask more questions, have followed up with them via email,” Murday said.“That’s really what we want students to get out of this, a personal relationship with those speakers. [We want them to] feel like they have resources at Georgetown that they can reach out to, so I think it’s been very successful so far.”
The last “Mentorship” session took place Tuesday night in the ICC auditorium. The “Cura Personalis” sessions will be held on Nov. 16 at 2 p.m., Nov. 17 at 8 p.m., and Nov. 20 at 7 p.m. All are in the ICC auditorium. The dates for the “Community in Diversity” sessions will be released in January.

The Teletandem program, which matches Georgetown students with language partners in other countries via Skype, expanded to include Spanish, Arabic, French, Japanese, Russian and Turkish this semester after receiving a one-year grant from the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship.
The program was founded in 2008 and was previously only offered in Portuguese. Teletandum is unrelated to the Language Exchange Program, which connects students from different language backgrounds in person at Georgetown.
Michael Ferreira, a professor in the Portuguese department who helped introduce the program to Georgetown, said that the goal of Teletandem is to help students achieve foreign language fluency while participating in cultural exchange.
“One of the things we noticed was that Georgetown students were too busy with their extracurricular activities to work into their schedule these interactions that are so vital in achieving oral proficiency,” Ferreira said. “What we’re doing is essentially making these interactions possible for students.”
Currently, the Arabic department offers a one-credit course with the Teletandem program, with 15 students enrolled. Students meet weekly for one hour to Skype with their language partners, who are students learning English at the University of Jordan and Jordan’s Al-Balqa` Applied University. Students converse with their partners in English for half the class and Arabic for the remainder of the class.
Terrence Potter, an Arabic professor who is coordinating the Arabic Teletandem program, stressed the importance of conversation in learning a foreign language.
“The skill you want to focus on is having conversations, which involves negotiating meaning, being receptive to your partner and all these things we normally have in a conversation which we take for granted,” Potter said. “But when you’re doing a foreign language, you have to come to an understanding of how you’re going to do those things.”
Joao Telles, the chief coordinator of the Teletandem program, has been running the program in his native Brazil and coordinating international interactions for over a decade.
“I am very impressed with the way things are going,” Telles said. “There are many languages in Georgetown that we want to integrate Teletandem into, so it’ll be interesting to see how it plays out. We are running a lot of research to see how we can improve for the future.”
Ferreira predicts that programs like Teletandem will soon be integrated into most language classrooms.
“In the future, it would be interesting to see [Teletandem courses] become a general requirement for people in the languages,”Ferreira said. “It doesn’t overwhelm you really. All you do is sit and talk to someone for an hour, which is a lot more engaging than sitting in a lecture.”
Rabia Mirza (COL ’16), a student in the Arabic Teletandem program, said that she finds the program to be helpful to her study of Arabic.
“I definitely find the program helpful, as I’m not currently enrolled in any intensive Arabic class,” Mirza wrote in an email. “My professor once told me that if you don’t use a language you’re learning for more than two weeks, you forget it. The Skype course prevents me from forgetting it altogether.”
However, Mirza says that the program is impeded by logistical issues that are not present in the in-person language exchange program on Georgetown’s campus.
“There seems to be more conversational depth with an in-person language partner,” Mirza wrote. “In my experience, I was never assigned a conversation topic, which was more fun, unique, and beneficial in terms of learning Arabic.”
Yuka Akiyama, a coordinator of the Japanese Teletandem program, also acknowledged several difficulties in setting up the Skype sessions between her 19 students in Georgetown and the students in Japan.
“Time difference is a killer in our setup. We have a 13-hour time difference, and that makes it very difficult to schedule a session,” she wrote in an email. “In addition, we also face technical issues such as weak Internet connection and the malfunction of computers.”
Despite this, Mirza said that she is learning about culture and society in her partner’s country.
“I remember having personal conversations with my language partner about her family, relationships and controversial opinions,” Mirza wrote. “Through this, I not only learned cultural elements but also nuanced language that would benefit me more on a day-to-day basis rather than the political and formal terms that are constantly thrown at us.”

Economics professor Rodney Ludema, who taught at Georgetown for almost 20 years, joined the U.S. State Department as chief economist in July and will serve in this position for a year.
In his new position, Ludema provides the State Department with analysis of economic aspects of foreign policy.
“The best way to think about it is this: gone are the days when countries would follow the advice of the United States simply because we said so,” Ludema said. “Now we have to convince countries of the appropriate policies and convince them with credible analysis and solid evidence.”
The position, which is at the assistant secretary level, was created by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to facilitate an effective connection between economic and foreign policy. The chief economist reports to the under secretary of state for economic growth, Energy and the Environment.
Ludema said that he took the position to gain a new perspective on international trade, a subject he often studies.
“Sometimes it’s easy to write academic papers that address issues that are of concern to other academics, and so I think it’s important to every once in a while take a step back, pick your head up and look around and see what issues are actually important in the world,” Ludema said. “This is a really good way of doing that, so I am learning a lot and focused on issues that previously hadn’t been on my radar.”
Ludema’s research focuses on international trade policy, international political economy and the connection between trade and the environment. He founded Georgetown’s International Economics Seminar and served as the program’s director in 2003 and again from 2006 to 2010. He is the editor of the Journal of International Economics.
Ludema served as the senior international economist at the Council of Economic Advisers in the Executive Office of the President from 2012 to 2013.
Economics professor Anna Mayda, one of Ludema’s colleagues, said that she thinks that his calm personality will help him succeed in his government appointment.
“The nice thing about him is that although he is very smart, he is very laid-back and not too self-centered so he is also a very good teacher,” Mayda said. “It’s not just working together but learning a lot through the process and that may not happen if you have a senior person who is self-centered.”
Mayda said that Ludema shows a true passion for research and academia, which makes him an excellent candidate for his job.
“He is passionate about what he works on I can see that he really likes to do research and that is important when you are in academia,” Mayda said. “I can see that doing research is fun for him, it is not a burden.”
Ludema said that he will return to Georgetown to teach when his appointment is over.
“I very much like Georgetown and academia,” Ludema said. “I am an academic at heart, it is my life-blood, and so to put on a suit and work within a bureaucracy — it’s not natural for me.”
Maria Hamdouchi (SFS ’16), who took Ludema’s International Trade class, said that his passion for economics was evident in class and made him an excellent professor.
“He takes being a professor very seriously and he cares about his students,” Hamdouchi said. “As far as academia goes, he ‘gets it’ in that he doesn’t present all of the information as if its something you can learn in books; he really tries to apply it.”

Pratima Dharm, former army captain and chaplain, recently began her work as Georgetown’s first Hindu chaplain. She joins the existing Campus Ministry staff of Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, Orthodox and Protestant chaplains. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
How do you think your experience in the military will affect how you approach your new position at Georgetown?
There are a lot of parallels, but at the same time there are many new things that are unique to the campus ministry. The parallel of the age category, from 17 to about 28 or 30, is what we primarily focus on. I have been the lead chaplain for suicide prevention for years in the military. That is one of the things that we have to deal with a lot in the military with the young soldiers. Those are parallels that I find perhaps, even on a campus ministry, if they’re not apparent right now, would come forward in the future. It’s a good preparation point to start from. Also some of the main issues of identity, issues of stress related with studies and education, we see the parallels that are found in the military as well with the young soldiers.
What function do you think spirituality serves on a college campus?
I think it’s a huge part in shaping the person, the individual that comes to be a part of the Georgetown family and culture. I would use the word, “spiritual formation.” It is very relevant to the point of their lives they are in at this time, where they are not fully formed. I’m not saying that as we grow up we are fully formed, but in terms of certain choices, for young persons, especially in the age category you find predominantly at Georgetown, I find that they still have a lot of questions about identity. They have a lot of questions about the choices they are making, about career choices, about the fields to study and things of that nature, even in terms of the relationships they have as they transition from home to college. Things of that nature are very important and relevant when you bring the faith piece in. I see a powerful connection between faith, spirituality and the formation of the whole person, not just to be focused on choosing a career path, but who they become ultimately. I think spirituality and religion plays a big, huge part in that.
What have been the most rewarding aspects of your time here already?
The most rewarding aspects have been the students. Oh my goodness, they are absolutely amazing. What is really amazing to me is how much that they have carried forth from their home culture to here, and the need they have to practice their religion, their faith and their spiritual practices within their university. That amazes me. They are so young, yet it is so important to them to practice their faith. Now, that is amazing to me. And they have so many questions, that I am most of the time able to answer. That to me is amazing that I am older now and I have something to offer to them. That I am in a place that I can offer something to these kids who are so eager to learn and to know more about their faith.
How are you looking to add to Campus Ministry, and the overall Georgetown community, moving forward?
It really stems from the fact that there has never been a Hindu chaplain at Georgetown. These Hindu students have been very good about organizing themselves and getting things done that way, but I am really taking my time to hear them and to listen to them and to know what the needs are. The future plans that I am actually right now just shaping and forming is based off of what I hear from them and their needs. The need is to have a strong mentor and a person they can go to in terms of counseling. Also, it is about creating those safe places for them, because this is a little new.
At the same time, there is a need to have a chaplain and creating those spaces where their learning is facilitated, while at the same time, they also get a break from learning itself. It’s developing achieving programs that aid their learning, but at the same time, give them a respite as well. They have so much coming at them that I’m amazed at their courseload and the events they’re expected to commit to and the life that they live. I’m in that boat right now to hear them and do what I do based off of what I hear from them to really create those safer spaces of balance, where they are really able to be themselves and hopefully have opportunities for spiritual formation, within the various diverse religious opportunities you have at Georgetown. It is a Jesuit institution and a great institution, but it is also very open to learning from different faith groups as well. The intentionality behind all programs would be to make sure that Hindu students avail themselves to be participating in other faith group activities to enhance their own understanding of their own faith. I am a big proponent for people having the opportunity to experience other cultures and other belief systems that may even challenge their own beliefs. I like to use the word balance. Balance is the word, and the freedom to choose.

A panel, co-hosted by the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs and the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, debated Islam and women’s rights in a discussion focused on religion, cultural traditions, secularism, democracy and gender equality in Riggs Library on Thursday evening.
Members of the panel included Berkley Center senior fellow Jocelyne Cesari, University of London Centre of Islamic and Middle Eastern Law research associate Ziba Mir-Hosseini, Syracuse University assistant professor of political science Yüksel Sezgin and GIWPS Executive Director Melanne Verveer (FLL ’66, GRD ’69). The discussion was mediated by José Casanova, head of the Berkley Center’s program on Globalization, Religion and the Secular.
Cesari said she believes that it is important to overcome oversimplified ideas and to view the issue of Islam and gender equality with a modern point of view.
“It is important to look at the diversity and the plurality of content and legitimacy of human rights across different nations,” Cesari said. “It is very problematic when the discussion happens only engaging the Islamic text. It is central that we look at what is the situation today regarding women’s rights and not look at the Islamic tradition as a compact entity, but rather look at the way that it has been nationalized and contextualized in different areas.”
Mir-Hosseini said she believes that we are now at a threshold in a new phase of dynamics and relations between religion, gender and state, which are becoming more transparent.
“It is becoming transparent what are the local and global structures in which Muslim women have to struggle for justice and equality,” Mir-Hosseini said. “Their problem is not only local, but it is global as well. It is also making the link between theology and polities as Muslim women’s struggle for gender equality is as much theological as it is political.”
Sezgin spoke about the relationship between Sharia law and democracy.
“Let’s assume for a second that when Muslims say democracy they mean the liberal democracy as we know it here in the western society,” Sezgin said. “If that is the assumption, is this an oxymoronic demand by Muslims? It is very difficult for us to think of Islam democracy and the presumed relationship with seculars within a democracy. But I believe that we cannot expect a democratic elected Muslim government to abolish Sharia, so they have to find a way to sustain Sharia and at the same time sustain democracy.”
Verveer highlighted the fact that Muslim women are calling for a change and expressing their needs.
“The fact that so many women say to me that they are tired, frustrated and depressed shows this change,” Verveer said. “They say that their religion, which they hold dear and means everything to them, is being hijacked by others, whether by extremist or male patriarchal interpretations.”
According to Verveer, the women are prevented from fully practicing their religion.
“This is keeping them from being what they believe that they can be, which is being empowered, faithful and religious” Verveer said. “They have now moved to a place where they are not rejecting their religion, but rather recasting all of those values that interpreted what is right for them, in ways that they are not true to their roots or what they see as their religious identity.”
Ingrid Glitz (SFS ’18), who attended the event, said she appreciated the openness of the discussion.
“This was one of the best panels that I’ve been to since I got here in Georgetown,” Glitz said. “The speakers were extremely knowledgeable and provided an interesting insight into the issue of gender inequality in the Muslim world.”

“Cesari said she believes that it is important to overcome oversimplified ideas and to view the issue of Islam and gender equality with a modern point of view.”
Islam’s treatment of women should embrace a “modern point of view”?  
I think I need another cup of coffee.
