With classes coming to a close and the burden of move-out drawing near, many Georgetown students must decide which company they will entrust with their belongings over the summer.
The Corp’s Student Storage, which bills itself as “the Official Storage Provider of Georgetown University,” allows students unable or unwilling to transport their belongings home for the summer to store them temporarily until they return to campus.
Unlike some other locally run companies, Student Storage also offers the opportunity for students studying abroad for a year or even a semester.
A Corp Student Storage competitor, D.C. Student Storage, is a D.C.-based company with prices similar to those offered by The Corp. Like Student Storage, D.C. Student Storage is student-run and owned, according to its Web site.
Collegeboxes, first founded at Duke University, has expanded to over 50 schools nationwide offering Georgetown students another storage option.
Collegeboxes Brand Manager Bethan McGarry (SFS ’12) said that the benefits of her employer’s company included a barcode tracking system and $100 insurance on every box. One-hundred twenty students stored with Collegeboxes last year.
With these boxing companies, students place an order online, pack their belongings in the provided boxes, and the services will come to campus and pick students’ belongings up in these boxes and store them in climate-controlled units for the summer.
When it comes to preferences in a storage company, students say that it boils down to pricing.
“I really have no option but to store my things over the summer, and I would prefer it if storage was reasonably priced,” said Josefin Dahlerus (SFS ’13), an international student from Sweden.
Within the past year, there have been changes to the structure of The Corp’s Seasonal Services, which is responsible for providing the Turkey and Bunny Shuttles as well as running the summer storage service.
In order to maximize efficiency of Corp workers and to lessen the workload, two more management positions have been established in the Seasonal Services management team.
The Student Storage program is boosting accessibility by adding another pod located at Poulton Hall this year, where students can drop off their boxes before they are shipped to an off-campus storage location. The space will primarily serve the Village B, West Georgetown and university townhouse communities.
The creation of storage drop-off sites located behind St. Mary’s Hall will serve Burleith residents. Prior to this year, the closest location for these students was Bulldog Alley in the Leavey Center.
This year marks the startup of the Summer Storage Grant, which will provide two students with a $100 discount toward their storage order. Applications for the grant are currently being accepted on The Corp’s Web site until Friday.
Jamie O’Neill, director of Corp Seasonal Services, highlighted the importance of this extra service.
“In all that we do, Student Storage strives to keep The Corp’s motto of `students serving students’ thriving, and the grant is just one more way to do this,” she said.

A student-created bill to reduce the pollution stemming from plastic and paper bags from the Hilltop has made it to Capitol Hill, after it was introduced Thursday by Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va).
Five students, Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13), Matthew Strom (COL ’10), Brian Lin (COL ’10), Mariel Reed (SFS ’10) and Toni Harrison (GRD) are currently enrolled in a course called Shaping National Science Policy, a semester-long tutorial that teaches students how to be lobbyists for the semester. The class was split up into three groups, one of which focused on vector-borne ailments in reference to climate change, the other on creating a bike-sharing program that would lower pollution and contribute to public health.
Kohnert-Yount’s group focused on reducing the consumption of single-use, disposable retail bags. Their resolution was introduced to Congress on April 22, and according to Environment and Energy Daily, “has great potential to get passed.”
The resolution, available to view on the Students for Responsible for Bag Policy Web site www.switchbags.org, encourages initiatives to reduce the use of paper and plastic bags. Content on the site emphasizes the degree to which bags can consume natural resources, increase waste production and contribute to the amount of litter created.
The resolution specifically references the amount of litter found in D.C.’s Anacostia River, where most pollutants are plastic bags. In the Los Angeles River, plastic bags make up over 43 percent of litter. Strom added that the 5-cent bag tax was a positive step, because it habituates consumers to reconsider their purchases without great financial burden.
The resolution specifically several goals. One goal is getting businesses to reduce the amount of paper and plastic bags they use by 40 percent over the next five years. Another goal is encouraging companies to endorse the consumption of reusable bags by giving incentives to consumers who do so.
“A number of regional and national companies already have these programs, which involve compensating or rewarding shoppers when they skip the disposable bag or use their own reusable bag. The list includes Wal-Mart, Target, CVS, Publix, Kroger and IKEA,” Strom said. “We would like more businesses to be made aware of these programs and their benefits. They improve public image, increase consumer loyalty and ultimately allow businesses to purchase far fewer disposable bags than they used to.”
Kohnert-Yount said that the solution to the problem of single-use bags is easy, and that consumers only need to start carrying reusable bags.
The students who wrote the resolution do not expect overnight results, but said that implementing more environmentally conscious practices will be a process.
“We need to continue our work on advocacy and education so that consumers, businesses and communities are aware of the issue and [are] committed to reducing the use of disposable bags,” Kohnert-Yount said.

Met by complaints and campaigns from Burleith and Georgetown residents, Georgetown presented the final version of its 2010 Campus Plan to members of the Georgetown community Monday evening. Administrators are aiming to submit the final plan to the D.C. Zoning Commission for approval in early summer.
Monday’s meeting at Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School was the long-awaited sequel to a series of meetings in November 2009 at which residents of neighborhoods surrounding the university voiced their concerns over Georgetown’s proposed construction projects for the coming decade.
Under District laws, Georgetown University, along with all other D.C. universities located in residential areas, is required to submit a plan for new construction projects every 10 years. Georgetown’s 2000 Campus Plan is set to expire on Dec. 31 of this year, according to Linda Greenan, assistant vice president of external relations, who headed the meeting with university architect Alan Brangman.
The final 2010 plan included several changes from the initial draft released in the fall. Following neighborhood input, the planned convocation center was nixed, Students’ Neighborhood Action Program cars’ weekend presence was tapped for an increase, and boosted weekend patrols by the Department of Public Safety and the Metropolitan Police Department were encouraged.
While Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson referred to the plan in a Friday meeting as moderate and representative of all stakeholders’ interests, members of the Burleith Citizens Association and the Citizens Association of Georgetown expressed disappointment Monday evening and said that many of their grievances had not been addressed in the revised final version. Attendees were informed at the start of the meeting that the plan before them would not likely change prior to its submission to the D.C. Zoning Commission.
“This is essentially the framework of the plan. We don’t intend any changes before submitting to the commission,” Greenan said.
BCA president Lenore Rubino said that Georgetown had not adequately dealt with the BCA’s concerns.
“The main issues of noise, alcohol-related problems and behavioral issues are much larger than these revisions. Nor does [the Campus Plan] take into account the increased burden on Burleith, Georgetown and the surrounding communities for the increase in graduate enrollment,” Rubino said.
During a BCA meeting Wednesday, Rubino and members of the BCA shared their concerns with their fellow residents. Using the results of a survey performed by members of the BCA, Rubino and others demonstrated their fears that undergraduate and graduate renters were overrunning Burleith. According to the BCA’s survey, 41 percent of the 531 houses in Burleith are rented. The BCA also said that Burleith was the home of 425 Georgetown students in fall.
The BCA and CAG have pushed the university to build more housing on campus in order to keep more undergraduates within Healy Gates all four years. Under the new plan, however, no additional housing will be built on campus.
Despite Georgetown’s efforts to house students on campus – 84 percent of undergraduates are housed on campus following the creation of the Southwest Quad in 2003 – and its pledge in the 2010 plan to cap traditional undergraduate enrollment at its current level of 6,016, the main point of contention for Georgetown residents has become graduate students.
The new plan proposes enrolling 2,475 additional graduate students over the next 10 years, a significant decrease from the version of the plan presented in November. The concerns of residents seem to have played little part in this reduction, however: Greenan announced Monday that the decrease in the final plan was due solely to recent revelations that there has already been a substantial increase of graduate students in 2010. At the same time, the university will construct apartments in the block of 37th and 36th Streets between N and Prospect Streets in order to provide 120 new beds for graduate students.
CAG President Jennifer Altemus (COL ’88) found the extra 120 beds to be inadequate and did not believe the university was taking sufficient measures to account for the new spike in graduate students.
In addition to concerns over community identity, Georgetown residents have also expressed their worries about the noise and disturbance Georgetown students tend to cause on weekends. The university has taken steps in the 2010 plan to address these concerns by calling for the addition of three MPD detail officers on the weekends, installing community advisers in Burleith and West Georgetown and instituting a second SNAP patrol car to monitor the neighborhood.
Olson said that the addition of the second SNAP car, first introduced in January, has been effective. Not all residents agree with his assessment, however.
“[The addition is like] trying to put out a raging forest fire with a bucket of water,” said BCA Vice President Walter Hillabrant.
Other contested issues between the university and the community include the rerouting of GUTS buses through the Canal Street entrance, additional parking spaces on campus and a proposed 83-foot chimney on top of the university’s heating and cooling plant. On Monday evening, the university proposal to add retail space on the same block slated for graduate student housing also received heated criticism from residents in attendance.
It seems that the vocal opposition from residents will do little to deter the university from moving forward. According to Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner-2E Student Commissioner Aaron Golds (COL ’11), the next step forward in the process will come when the university formally files the 2010 Campus Plan with the D.C. Zoning Commission and the D.C. Office of Planning.
This meeting is not the final avenue of dissent for residents: The D.C. Zoning Commission traditionally
values the input of the ANC. According to ANC Chairman Ron Lewis, the ANC 2E representing Georgetown, Burleith and Hillandale, Md., will gather information on the sentiments surrounding the plan once it has been submitted to the Zoning Commission. The seven commissioners of ANC 2E will then convene and vote on how to advise the D.C. Zoning Commission.
For groups like the BCA and the CAG, the next step will involve filing for party status at the formal hearing of the Georgetown Campus Plan before the D.C. Zoning Commission. According to Altemus, party status at the hearing would provide the BCA and the CAG with the opportunity to formally present their opposition to the Campus Plan.
Other hurdles the 2010 Campus Plan will have to scale include an evaluation by the D.C. Office of Planning and a review by the Old Georgetown Board. The Chief of Staff of the Office of Planning Tanya Washington described the office’s role in dealing with the Campus Plan. She said that the Office of Planning will consider community feedback and then make its recommendation about the plan to the Zoning Commission.
“OP will assess the plan and comments from the community and other agencies and make a recommendation to the Zoning Commission at their public hearing,” said Washington.
The U.S. Commission of Fine Arts appoints three architects to the Old Georgetown Board who hold the responsibility of preserving the historic district of Georgetown. According to Lewis, whose wife serves on the board, the three architects will only have an influence on the Campus Plan much later in the future when it comes to the outward appearance of the university’s new building projects.

Most congressional candidates do not have to factor homework time into their campaign schedules, but Andrew Gall, the 27-year-old graduate student running for Congress, does just that. With a staff consisting entirely of students, including two Georgetown undergraduates, Gall is looking to become the youngest member of Congress.
Gall is working toward his master’s degree in public policy at University of Maryland, College Park, while also campaigning against House Majority Leader Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) in Maryland’s 5th Congressional District.
Gall’s staffers are also much younger than their counterparts on Hoyer’s staff. Like Gall, a former intern and field organizer for the Obama campaign, every member of his staff is a student.
“The largest problem is simply the logistics of balancing schoolwork with the campaign,” Gall said in an e-mail. “However, there’s no question that the energy and the ability to think about old problems in new ways as a result of an all-student staff outweigh any negatives.”
Georgetown students Kiran Gandhi (COL ’11) and Alex Silberman (COL ’11) both work on Gall’s campaign. Gandhi is a research intern, and Silberman is the chief speechwriter and deputy press secretary.
“This is a grassroots campaign with tons of opportunities for college students to get involved at very high levels of campaign strategy,” Silberman said. “I got involved in the Andrew for Congress campaign because I strongly support his passion for progressive, responsible and innovative solutions to America’s most pressing issues.”
Gall said that having a student-run staff enables him to campaign without relying on corporate backing.
“I don’t simply talk about special interests as a way to gin up votes, but [I] actually and deeply believe that once we first address the role of special interest money in our legislative process, we will then be able to much more successfully address the other issues – from tax reform to climate change – facing America,” Gall said.
Gall’s platform is centered around transparency, more funding for education, the environment, and opposition to the Iraq war, which Hoyer supported. The two candidates platforms are similar on many counts, with the major difference coming in the area of national security.
Gall’s belief in the importance of youth involvement in politics is evident in his campaign – not only does he have an exceptionally young staff, but if elected, Gall would also become the youngest member of Congress.
Gall said that the main problem in current political leadership is the lack of representation from the “Millennial Generation.” Due to this deficit, the government prioritizes funding programs like social security over education, according to Gall.
“This simply wouldn’t be the case if you had more young voters and young public officials,” Gall said.
“Rather, you would see a greater emphasis on issues that matter to us, like climate change, gay rights and the looming fiscal crisis.”
Gall aims to use his campaign to change what he sees as the status quo.
“I am running for Congress to hold Hoyer accountable for his disastrous and immoral support for invading Iraq, because I want to divorce special interest money from the policymaking process, and because I believe young people deserve a voice in shaping our futures,” Gall said.
“If students are interested in progressive politics, join my campaign – I still have openings I need to fill,” Gall said.

Lecture Fund, most commonly known on campus for bringing famous political speakers to campus, ignited campus-wide discussions when it brought Karl Rove, a senior adviser and deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush, to campus. Most members of the Georgetown community will attend at least one speaker event hosted by Lecture Fund during their time on the Hilltop, but few know much about the speaker selection process or the opportunities for student participation. With the end of the academic year approaching, Dara Gold (COL ’10), the chair of Lecture Fund, agreed to sit down with The Hoya to shed light on the organization’s mission.
Many people were either excited or put off by the Karl Rove’s visit to speak at Georgetown. Why select such a sometimes polarizing speaker?
The way Lecture Fund works is that there [are] 25 associate board members that go out and find speakers. Someone from our group actively went out and asked him to lecture. We didn’t all come together and decide to invite him – someone specifically went out and invited him. It turned out not to be so difficult, logistically, because he’s a local speaker [based in the Washington, D.C. area], and he accepted our lower price.
Why did Karl Rove offer a discount to Lecture Fund?
Well, to be clear, he didn’t specifically offer a discount. The student that invited him offered him an amount of money [that] he happened to accept and [that] happened to be lower than what he normally asks for. We were all surprised and happy that he accepted our lower offer, but he also has a new book coming out, so it’s also an opportunity for him to do a book signing, get publicity on that in his local area. Sometimes [Lecture Fund and the speaker] get a really good deal like that.
Since Lecture Fund is a Student Activities Commission group, are there any effects from Georgetown University Student Association’s club finance reform that will impact the budget for next year?
We still haven’t received our final budget this year from SAC. Things are being delayed, I think, because of the reform. We’re still waiting to see what exactly will happen. We are concerned, but I can’t say how much right now, because I haven’t seen the final budget yet.
Is Lecture Fund primarily driven by the initiative of individual members?
Lecture fund is structured with 25 members of the associate board. Everyone has the opportunity to go out and invite speakers that they find interesting. After that, they will bring to the group a plan, based on whether or not the speaker has agreed, and how much they will cost. Then, the whole group decides whether or not to spend the money on the speaker. For Karl Rove specifically, someone came to the group, and brought to the group his price and his dates and his availability. We thought about it, and it hit all of our criteria for a good lecturer.
What are the criteria for a “good” lecturer?
It’s in line with our mission statement, which is that we want to promote dialogue on campus – we want to bring speakers that students can ask challenging questions, that can spark some campus debate. We also look at things like cost-per-head, and if the speaker brings some diversity in terms of our lecture series so far [during that school year].
The response of some students to General David Petraeus’ speech in Gaston Hall sparked discussion around campus. What is Lecture Fund’s response to that the protests? Jon Askonas (SFS ’13), a Lecture Fund member, has created the Hoyas for a Respectful Dialogue, in opposition to the protesters’ strategy.
First, whatever Jon is doing is entirely independent of Lecture Fund, and we do not endorse it in any way. We encourage campus debate and campus dialogue. We encourage the spirit of protesters, but not what they did. We encourage people, instead of interrupting events, to wait until the [Q-and-A] to ask pointed questions toward the speaker. We bring speakers like Karl Rove so that students can ask them pointed questions. That’s our goal, not to have our events interrupted because people disagree with them.
In addition to board members seeking out speakers, there’s also an option for students to submit ideas for speakers online at your Web site. How does that work?
The process gets all jumbled up. Sometimes we will set up surveys [in The Midnight Mug] and other popular campus locations, so people can write in the speakers that they want. If any of those suggestions sparks some interest in a member of Lecture Fund, they’ll go out and try to get them in the same manner that they would if it was their own idea. It works the same way for online submissions.
So one of the ways Lecture Fund seeks to hear the voices of the student body is through the online suggestion box. What other ways do you try to represent the student voice?
I think that [student representation] is facilitated in part by our large board. All of our board members have very diverse interests, and so [they] look for very different speakers. We will also sponsor other groups [who] come to us, hoping to invite a speaker, but looking for logistical and financial support. Again, we use very unbiased criteria to pick our events. We constantly ask ourselves if the speaker we choose adds to the diversity of the lecture series. We try to make it about more than just pandering to political views.
How does one go about joining Lecture Fund?
We have an affirmation period at the beginning of each semester, where we go over and read applications submitted online, but we are also a SAC group, so we also have a general membership group.
How competitive was the process to join the Associate Board?
It’s gotten somewhat competitive. We’ve had upwards of 20 applications a semester, and out of those, we’ve accepted between three and five people.
What do you look for when you read over the applications? Do you look for people with very strong and perhaps unique opinions?
We do look for people who have an interest in bringing different and unique speakers that appeal to a part of campus that may not normally be involved in the process, such as somebody from the sciences, and people who would look for speakers the rest of us [on Lecture Fund] wouldn’t think about. At the same time, we want someone [who’s] been to a lot of lectures, knows what a good lecture is, [and is] a proactive member, someone that will pull their weight.
Would you say you seek a well-rounded student for Lecture Fund, or a well-rounded Lecture Fund?
It’s both, in the sense that we want people with different interests, because Lecture Fund has a reputation for only seeking political speakers, but at the same time, we are looking for some uniform characteristics, like responsibility and diligence.
Who has been the most interesting speaker you’ve brought to campus this year?
Well, we brought Ralph Nader and Bruce Fein earlier this semester – that was after Petraeus. There was also a scientist, one of the first [speakers] we brought last year, [who] was really popular. That went very well. It was something a little out of the ordinary that we did, and it showed that the science community here at Georgetown is large and blossoming.
Who was your favorite speaker to listen to?
Some of our entertainment speakers have been very fun, very entertaining. We[‘ve] had Craig from Craig’s List, Ben from Ben & Jerry’s, and those people, the ones who talk about the beginnings of a company we all know, [are] exciting for campus, and they’re different and fun.

The 2010 AsiaFest, Boom Boom PAU, exhibited the talents of many of the Asian cultural and ethnic groups at Georgetown in Gaston Hall on Saturday night.
The event was designed to showcase the groups representing the entire Asian continent, highlighted by the acronym PAU, representing Pan-Asian Unity.
Jennifer Ju (SFS `10), one of the coordinators for AsiaFest, said, “We really tried to emphasize the cultural elements of Asiafest this year. From the very initial planning stages, we told the different Asian organizations and other groups that wanted to audition that their act must be cultural, and we really stuck to that standard.”
The event was MCed by Awaaz, a group described as “Georgetown’s unofficial Asian acting group” by Anupam Chakravarty (SFS’10). The group performed skits between performances, introducing the new acts while maintaining the theme of the show, according to Chakravarty.
Chakravarty compared the event favorably to its incarnations in years past, saying “I thought it had a lot more energy than it had in the past. It’s always a great show . but the coordinators did a great job of varying up the program this year.”
This year, there was a greater variety in the performances in the show. Jason Chan (MSB ’12), who sang in two performances, noted that the show emphasized Asian culture, as demonstrated by his performance of both a Chinese song and a Korean song.
“In terms of performances, diversity increased,” Chan said about the event.
Chakravarty also claimed that the pace was much improved over years past, declaring that the show moved pretty seamlessly.” Chakravarty suggested that the audience was more involved in the show than in previous years.
In addition to AWAAZ, other groups performing included Club Filipino, Chinese Student Association, Hawaii Club and Hoya Break Squad. There was also a fashion show by the Vietnamese Student Association.
“I was really impressed with everyone’s talents,” audience member Kat Koser (SFS ’12) said.
The event attracted a good-sized crowd, according to Chakravarty.

It is a battle that has been waged for generations: underage college students versus university administrators set to crack down on illegal drinking. Georgetown is no stranger to the ongoing debate, as a Friday e-mail – a recap of university alcohol and drug policy – sent by administrators to students made clear.
“Statistics show that alcohol use in the under-21 population is still widespread, and in fact, because it’s so widespread, it’s natural to think about where this alcohol consumption is occurring,” said Nick DeSantis of Choose Responsibility, a nonprofit group that lobbies for a lower drinking age.
On college campuses, underage drinking is a common occurrence behind locked dorm doors or in off-campus apartments, “where the alcohol itself is the event, and the goal is to drink as much of it as quickly as possible so you can get drunk,” DeSantis said.
Under the Student Code of Conduct, the possession of alcohol or alcohol-related paraphernalia – including beer funnels, beer pong tables and drinking games – is prohibited in student housing, regardless of a student’s age.
Violations are punishable by judicial sanctions that range from fines and essays to prosecution and suspension from the university.
Additionally, Georgetown will notify a student’s parents upon occurrence of a second alcohol-related violation, “out of concern for a student’s health, safety and welfare, and continued participation in the university community,” according to the code.
The policy is not meant to scare students, but to promote students’ health, according to Director of Media Relations Andy Pino.
The current guidelines follow student uproar in 2007 after Georgetown’s alcohol policy was made more stringent, raising concern among students of legal drinking age that their rights were being infringed upon.
And statistics indicate that the problem of drinking on college campuses is on the rise.
From 1998 to 2005, the number of American college students ages 18 to 24 who have taken part in binge drinking – a period of heavy episodic drinking – has increased from 42 to 45 percent, according to a June 2009 report from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
The same study also found that accidental alcohol-related deaths among college students jumped from 1,440 in 1998 to 1,825 in 2005 – an increase of nearly 27 percent.
In a move that some view as paradoxical, some universities have decided to meet this underage drinking problem head-on by relaxing their university alcohol policies.
While Georgetown does not offer an amnesty policy regarding alcohol consumption, Pino emphasized that a call to Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service does not mandate disciplinary action by the university.
“The health and safety of our students is an absolute priority for us, and students can be assured that they can call GERMS medical treatment without fear of discipline,” Pino said. “Residence Life staff often follow up with these students, but they do so out of care and concern, not from a disciplinary perspective.”
The current policy, he said, holds that alcohol-related paraphernalia is “inherently risky and unwise” and should be banned in on-campus housing.
Pino did not indicate the possibility of changes to the alcohol policy in the 2010-2011 Student Code of Conduct, which will be available online before the fall semester begins.
But other schools have implemented amnesty policies out of what they regard as concern for students. Mimicking a similar rule which Yale University adopted in 2006, Harvard College in 2009 added to its Student Handbook a drug and alcohol “amnesty policy” with the intention of encouraging underage students to seek medical attention in extreme cases of alcohol- or drug-related emergencies.
Under the policy, a student may bring a friend who is intoxicated or drug-impaired to a hospital or Harvard University Health Services or seek help from a residential life staff member. Neither the student nor the friend will face disciplinary action for using or providing alcohol or drugs, regardless of age or level of intoxication.
The policy goes a step further by stating that failure to seek assistance in an alcohol- or drug-related emergency would be used against students in possible disciplinary actions.
Although Harvard has seen an almost record-breaking high of intoxicated undergraduates seeking hospitalization, Harvard spokesman Kevin Galvin maintained that the numbers reflect a positive change, The Daily Beast reported last week.
“As the amnesty policy has been more widely communicated to students, one might expect a subsequent rise in alcohol-related admissions not because students are drinking more dangerously, but rather because they are being better bystanders, seeking medical care for friends who may have had too much to drink,” he said in the article.
In 2008, a group of college administrators boggled state legislators in drafting a petition to debate the effects of establishing 21 as the legal drinking age.
While it does not argue for a specific policy change, The Amethyst Initiative, led by John McCardell, former president of Middlebury College in Vermont, encourages university presidents to engage in a dialogue about how the 21-year-old mandate might not be working.
“This system is just designed to spark a conversation and act as a catalyst for discussion and debate for alcohol use on college campuses,” DeSantis said.
While the two platforms are not directly related, Choose Responsibly provides staff support for The Amethyst Initiative, he said.
DeSantis said the initiative encourages a frank discussion about underage drinking and seeks to propose possible alternatives to a drinking age, such as education programs for parents.
Since its founding, 135 schools have signed on, including Dartmouth College, Duke University, Johns Hopkins University and Smith College.
Pino said the university does not have plans to take part in the initiative.
“Georgetown is not signing the petition. We are focused on the health, safety and well-being of our students, and we will continue to work at providing a welcoming and safe social environment on campus that respects the law and our students,” he said.

A month after the forced closure of popular late-night haunt Philly Pizza & Grill, students have taken their business elsewhere, exploring new off-campus, delivery and even on-campus student-run options.
Tuscany Café, a restaurant offering takeout pizza, is located around the corner from Philly Pizza’s Potomac Street property. The establishment has welcomed the increased traffic, while Quick Pita, a fast food Middle Eastern operation across the street from Philly Pizza, reported no change in student patronage.
According to Tuscany Café owner Rashid Aigoumeziane, daytime and nighttime traffic has increased at the restaurant. Aigoumeziane said that the new customers were mostly students. Although he said he never considered his restaurant in competition with Philly Pizza, he attributes the influx of students to his establishment to Philly Pizza’s closure.
In contrast, Sam Wazzah, manager of Quick Pita, reported no change in business and lamented the departure of Philly Pizza. Wazzah said that he had been excited by Philly Pizza’s relocation in 2009 to Potomac Street, across from his business.
“We welcomed Philly [Pizza]. We thought it would bring in more traffic,” Wazzah said.
Wazzah said that he thought the two businesses could have had a good working relationship.
Philly Pizza was forced to shut its doors on March 9 after a month-long legal battle. The Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs revoked Philly Pizza’s certificate of occupancy in October, a decision later upheld by the Board of Zoning Adjustment. Philly Pizza was ruled to be operating as a fast food joint instead of a restaurant, which violates zoning requirements on residential streets. Many West Georgetown residents testified at BZA hearings about Philly Pizza’s operations, citing noise levels, patrons’ rowdy behavior and excessive trash.
Tuscany Café has received no such complaints, according to Aigoumeziane.
“We have had no neighbor complaints because we have more space. . There’s no one waiting outside,” Aigoumeziane said.
Quick Pita has received one complaint from an Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E commissioner who lives on the street, according to Wazzah.
ANC student representative Aaron Golds (COL ’11) said that he was unaware of any complaints from residents about area restaurants.
“There may be some, but not a number significant enough to become an issue,” Golds said in an e-mail.
Students said that they thought the complaints from residents about Philly Pizza were too extreme.
“It’s a shame that the neighborhood and Philly [Pizza] couldn’t come to an agreement,” Hannah Lomax-Vogt (COL ’12) said.
It is unclear what will become of the space recently vacated by Philly Pizza, according to Golds, but students said they felt the effects of its closing a month later. The move to Tuscany has been an unwelcome one for some students. Sam Fubara (COL ’11) bemoaned the loss of what he considered a Georgetown tradition.
“I go to Tuscany where, unfortunately, the pizza is far more oily,” Fubara said. “You just can’t replace Philly P.”
While many, like Fubara, now take the walk to Tuscany, others have opted for delivery offerings.
“[Philly Pizza’s closure] doesn’t affect my life greatly,” said Sara Higa (COL ’12), who has since switched to Domino’s delivery.
Some Georgetown students have also started selling pizza on campus. For several weeks in March and leading into April, the pledge class for Alpha Kappa Psi sold pizza at the Healy Gates. According to Nick Joosten (COL ’12), treasurer and chair of the fundraising committee for the fraternity’s pledge class, they sold pizza for five weeks and made a $350 profit. Joosten said that Philly Pizza’s closure was a deciding factor in Alpha Kappa Psi’s choice to raise money via front gates pizza sales.
At first, the pledge class sold the pizza on campus, but relocated to 37th and O Streets when the Department of Public Safety informed them that they could not sell the pizza on campus. Joosten said that despite visits by DPS and the Metropolitan Police Department, the Alpha Kappa Psi pledge class was undeterred.
“We stopped selling because we didn’t have any more pledge events to fundraise for. [DPS and MPD] shutting us down wasn’t a factor in our decision to stop selling pizza,” Joosten said.
Other groups have tried similar fundraising tactics. Alpha Epsilon Pi sold pizza outside of Lauinger Library, and at least one Relay For Life team sold brownies at the front gates. Shane Sarver (MSB ’12), captain of the Relay team, said that DPS asked the team to relocate its late-night bake sale to Alumni Square.
As the end of the year approaches, however, late-night food options at main-campus crossings have not become a weekly event, and students have continued pursuing off-campus fare instead.

On Sunday night, the Georgetown University Student Association Senate resolved several outstanding issues regarding the Student Activities Commission funding reform and passed two resolutions, one relating to university investment policy and the other creating a director of technology position for GUSA.
The senate was presented with a letter, written by SAC Chair Ethel Amponsah, in which SAC agreed to many of the reforms demanded by the senate and executive. SAC agreed to use $12,000 of its reserves to fund student groups in fiscal year 2011, and to use $150,000 of it in the next three years.
A committee consisting of SAC Chair Ethel Amponsah, the leader of the SAC Civic Commission and two other members of SAC advisory groups will now select the SAC commissioners. The votes of all the commissioners on all bulk allocations, when money is distributed to the student groups, will now be reported. At the end of the report, SAC requested that funds for the next year be released to the clubs.
Senator Nick Troiano (COL ’11) supported the allocation of the funds to SAC. “I think I’m happy with most of the reforms, though there’s still a lot of debate about the open voting question,” he said. He called upon SAC to make every vote open, while still calling upon GUSA to release the funds to SAC.
GUSA President Calen Angert (MSB ’11) reported to the senate about weekend GUTS bus service. Angert cited THE HOYA article from April 23 reporting that the SAC Alumni Gift Fund would soon run out of money.
Angert claimed that GUSA, as a partial partner in the fund, would have no choice but to support GUTS, saying, “For a school that has no Metro system . we should be working to correct that.” Angert pointed out that it seemed illogical to have the student government funding a service that was paid for during the week by the university, but declared that the service was essential.
Chair Adam Talbot (COL ’12) suggested that all people using the bus pay for it by swiping their GOCards and incurring a 25-cent charge each time they rode the bus. Such a fare, Talbot claimed, would still make it more available than the Circulator, which charges 50 cents with a Smart trip card. No resolutions were drafted on the issue.
A resolution on the ethics of university investment policies, drafted by Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13), served as a response to a presentation by Georgetown, Divest! at the previous GUSA senate meeting.
In the resolution, GUSA called upon the university to “strive to exercise its shareholder rights” by sending proxies to stand for the university at meetings with fund managers and by forming a committee to examine the university’s investments, which would listen to concerns raised by students about the nature of those investments.
Gustafson said that such an action would be necessary for the university to honor its Jesuit ideals. Ideally, she said, the new committee would serve as a mechanism for students to voice their concerns.
Sen. Colton Malkerson (COL ’13) supported the resolution but warned that the senate should make clear that the resolution was not in support of any one group on campus.
“I just want to make sure that we don’t support [Georgetown, Divest!] too broadly,” Malkerson said. “I wouldn’t want them to take this resolution to mean that we support them fully.”
The resolution passed the senate with 14 voting in favor and four abstaining.
The second resolution, drafted by Malkerson, dealt with the proposed director of technology position for GUSA. The resolution would create the position, which would be tasked with recording, posting and archiving meetings and committees that requested the use of such a system. The director of technology would receive a $300 stipend per semester.
The resolution passed the senate, with 14 voting yes and three voting no.
