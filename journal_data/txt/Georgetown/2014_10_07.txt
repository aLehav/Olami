At a training session on disability for student leaders last week, Lydia Brown (COL ’15) faced an empty room.
The disability rights advocate, who runs a blog called “Autistic Hoya,” was scheduled to give a presentation on making campus events accessible. However, no student leaders showed up for the session.
“Why doesn’t the word disability catch people’s attention? This is because if you’re not disabled yourself, you aren’t good friends with someone who’s disabled, you don’t have a family member who’s disabled, disability isn’t on your radar,” Brown said. “It’s not something you’re going to be looking for or something that will catch your attention when you’re skimming through an email.”
The session, scheduled at noon on Sept. 29, was part of the Center for Student Engagement’s Lunch and Learn series, which has also drawn low attendance for events covering budgeting, event planning and the platform HoyaLink.
According to Associate Dean of Student Engagement Erika Cohen Derr, the CSE broadcasted the event with flyers, emails and a Facebook event. Despite this, leaders of student groups said that they could not attend due to both advertising and scheduling problems.
College Democrats Chair Chandini Jha (COL ’16), Lecture Fund Chair Marcus Stromeyer (SFS ’15) and Georgetown University Student Association Director of Communications Max Harris (COL ’15) all said that the event occurred when many club representatives were in class and that the event was not well-advertised.
“The email we received from CSE did not mention the event in the title, causing [College Democrats] as an executive board to be collectively unaware about it happening,” Jha wrote in an email.
Cohen Derr said CSE administrators are working to address the lack of student attendance at these events.
“Given the low attendance throughout the Lunch and Learn series, my colleagues in CSE and I are consulting with campus partners, and student leaders in GUSA and the Council of Advisory Boards to consider how to best share this information with student leaders so that organizations can be prepared proactively,” Cohen Derr wrote.
Despite the issues with publicity, Brown said that the lack of attendance shows that student leaders do not prioritize disability access on campus. She wrote a blog post titled “This is What the Empty Room Means” on her website, autistichoya.com, about these slights of “casual indifference.” The post, published Sept. 29, garnered 50 comments.
“At Georgetown, we in theory have a commitment to diversity; in theory we have a commitment to representing people from different communities, different backgrounds of different experience and identities; but in reality that often doesn’t play out,” Brown said.
According to Jha, the College Democrats put disability access at a high priority for its events. Jha said that she has spoken with Brown to plan a training session for the club’s executive board.
“Creating ability-accessible events is a definite priority,” Jha wrote. “The fact that no clubs sent representatives to the Lunch and Learn event was a major wake-up call to how this issue is just not addressed comprehensively on campus.”
Stromeyer said that the Lecture Fund is also dedicated to accessibility, but that cost prohibits hiring sign language interpreters at every event. He said that the Lecture Fund will work with Brown in a training session as well.
“We run into trouble having sign language interpreters at our events, which is really expensive,” Stromeyer said. “We always want it at events [but] we have a limited budget, and it’s $500 per event at least, so we keep hounding [the Academic Resource Center], but they would say they’re funding academic events so they can’t pay for the Lecture Fund to have accessibility for deaf students.”
Harris said that he thinks that the problem lies mostly with university administrators who should take steps to improve disability access.
“I think the administration should be doing a lot more,” Harris said. “The door to the Healey Family Student Center doesn’t have a disability access button, elevators are failing all over campus, the new construction on campus because of the campus plan — I don’t even know how you enter Leavey Center in a wheelchair.”
Brown agreed that funding for disability access and lack of support from university administrators were the main issues with creating a more accessible campus for students with disabilities.
“Student groups and academic departments do not receive enough funding in their budgets to pay for such costs so they are routinely holding events that are not accessible,” Brown said. “They have to chose: do we hold this event and be inaccessible and risk criticism from Lydia Brown and other disabled people, or do we dig into our budget and use all of the money from the whole semester on one event? They shouldn’t have to make that choice.”
Doctoral Candidate Chris DeLorenzo, who has autism, said that he feels that there is a cycle of indifference to disability issues at Georgetown.
“Our problem is institutional, it’s systematic,” DeLorenzo said. “It’s this cycle where disability isn’t on people’s radar screens, therefore it is kept off of people’s radar screens. It’s a self-perpetuating cycle for as long as I’ve been here, at least.”
Brown said that while the university has made attempts to be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act on paper, access has not improved for disabled students.
“When we talk about disability, we approach it as if it is somebody’s private, individual medical problem,” Brown said. “The way to deal with it is to treat it and hope to cure it, as opposed to thinking about disability as a diversity and a social justice issue. We’re here. We’re a part of the world but we are not considered a community because people deny us the ability to be recognized as a community.”

Cultural and advocacy groups with official months designated in their honor will receive funding and support from the Office of the President for programming during that time of the year.
Cultural groups will receive $500 in funding each year for their respective heritage months, with an additional $1,000 available for groups that demonstrate need. This money is in addition to funding that the groups already receive.
The university will fund Latino and Hispanic Heritage Month from mid-September to mid-October, Disability Culture and Awareness Month in October, LGBTQ History Month or “OUTober,” Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month in May, Native American Heritage Month in November, Black History Month in February and Women’s History Month in March.
In recent years, programming during these months has included has included a flash mob in Red Square for Black History Month sponsored by the Black Student Alliance, a semi-formal dinner in Copley Formal Lounge sponsored by the Latin American Alliance and the South Asian Society’s annual Rangila dance performance during Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month.
Joseph Ferrara, chief of staff to the president of the university, said that this initiative is built to aid the efforts of committed students in each cultural group.
“Students work together, bringing together a variety of student groups to develop programming for these months” Ferrara said. “This is nothing new. We are simply providing support to this existing process.”
This initiative was set into motion last February when a group of student representatives of the Black House submitted a set of proposals about cultural groups to University President John J. DeGioia. A committee of students, faculty and administrators was created to address each proposal.
The student groups that would become a part of this initiative were not selected by the university, but were selected instead based on their federally recognized national heritage months.
According to Ferrara, student groups are not limited to this university funding, and can fundraise for their respective heritage months as well.
“The funds are going to support the various activities they are developing,” Ferrara said. “Students may well raise funds from other sources and we encourage that.”
One of the heritage months that the university will be recognizing is OUTober, a month dedicated to the LGBTQ community. GU Pride President Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) said that he recognized the significance of the Office of the President’s recognition of the LGBTQ movement, which received university recognition comparatively recently, with the 2007 opening of the LGBTQ Center.
“Having the Office of the President recognize your program is dramatic,” Lloyd said. “DeGioia will be the first president of any Catholic campus to formally recognize this many programs.”
According to Lloyd, this new funding initiative symbolizes the administration’s growing acceptance of LGBTQ students and clubs.
“Georgetown has been the model for other schools,” Lloyd said. “To have the president say ‘This is important to us’ and meeting the needs of LGBTQ students really sends a message.”
Lloyd said he is critical of the Student Activities Commission budget, and said that the monetary benefit of university recognition is essential, especially since hosting a cultural month event puts additional financial strains on a student group.
“The reality is that the SAC budget has been stretched to the limit,” Lloyd said. “For diversity groups, this is particularly troubling. The university should be demonstrating a priority for respecting the diversities of its students.”
In addition to OUTober, the Office of the President will fund and recognize Latin@ Leadership month. Nancy Hinojos (SFS ’15), the resident director of Black House and a member of the Latino Leadership Forum, said that the new funding made the group feel supported by the university and its administrators.
“It’s important to not only acknowledge that yes, this is our heritage month, but also to see how much depth there is,” Hinojos said. “We feel very supported by the Office of the President and we’re glad this is happening.”
According to Hinojos, prior to this initiative, the Latino community did not have significant institutional support for heritage events. Now, Hinojos said that it is much easier to be in contact with the president’s office.
“There have been several points of contact that have been helping us, attending our meetings and staying engaged with our leadership,” Hinojos said.
Hinojos said she has noticed that the support of the president has led to more successful events and a greater range of diversity.
This headline has been changed.

Agreed; The Hoya is a student publication and thus, should respect those groups who have worked tremendously on making these events possible. I didn’t realize The Hoya writers were inadequate of expanding their vocabulary to remain sensitive to other student’s identifications (whether racially, culturally, religiously, etc.). Next time, use this headline in an op-ed instead if you don’t want to be criticized.

Protesters, including several Georgetown students, marched through the streets of Foggy Bottom and Georgetown on Saturday, calling for the arrest of police officer Darren Wilson and the demilitarization of the U.S. police force in response to the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in August.
The protest coincided with the initial stages of a Metropolitan Police Department program to increase transparency. MPD began equipping police officers with body cameras Oct. 1 to document all actions taken by officers in relation to civilians. The pilot program, which cost the department $1 million, includes 165 MPD officers.
“We are looking at the best practices for implementing these devices,” MPD Chief Cathy Lanier said in a press release. “We are in an age where this type of technology is becoming more common, and we want to capitalize on that. The presence of cameras will benefit the community and MPD members by improving police services, increasing accountability and enhancing public safety.”
Washington, D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray pointed at the events in Ferguson as a catalyst for MPD’s body camera program.
“Especially since the unfortunate incidents in Ferguson, Mo., have brought the issue of body cameras to national attention, I’m proud that MPD will continue to show leadership in this area,” Gray said in a press release.
The D.C. Ferguson march was organized by the National Black United Front, the ANSWER Coalition, Party for Socialism and Liberation, American Muslim Alliance and We Act Radio, a progressive radio station in D.C. Around 250 to 300 people attended the event, including about 20 Georgetown students.
Demonstrators gathered for the march at the Foggy Bottom Metro Station at approximately 7 p.m., after which protesters gradually made their way to Georgetown by way of M Street. The group stopped traffic at the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue and M Street, and at the corner of 34th Avenue and M Street to talk publicly about the issues surrounding the shooting.
“The idea of the event was that, since people are starting to lose interest and lose focus on the Ferguson issue, which still remains an issue in Ferguson and with police brutality in America, by disrupting traffic and going to the epicenter of privileged Washington in Georgetown, it’s bringing back that this issue is not over, and we’re going to keep fighting for it regardless of whether the rest of the country wants to listen,” said Vincent DeLaurentis (SFS ’17), who attended the march.
Police cars followed the rally through the streets of D.C. to ensure the safety of the protestors and civilians.
“As it relates to marches, the Metropolitan Police Department recognizes individuals’ rights to assemble,” Gwendolyn Crump, director of the MPD Office of Communications, wrote in an email.
Throughout the march, protesters cried, “Shut down police brutality,” accompanied by drumbeats and dancing by the attendees.
“The atmosphere was very inclusive, and onlookers on the sidewalk were encouraged to join, and cars honked all the way from Foggy Bottom to Georgetown,” Carlo Izzo (COL ’17), who participated in the march, said.
Two months after the shooting of Brown, attendees hoped that the march would prevent the incident from fading from the public consciousness.
“I decided to go because I wanted to show how I stand in solidarity with Ferguson and how I am against police brutality, and how I am against racism we’re seeing in police structure. I also wanted to make sure the case of Michael Brown is not only a moment, but a movement,” Patrick Bylis (COL ’17) said.
Attendees also highlighted the lack of accountability for police brutality as a major concern.
“I think the hopes are indicative of the wider Ferguson movement: for people to become aware of how police brutality affects communities of color in America and to take substantive reforms so that brutality isn’t happening, and that when it does happen, there is accountability for the people involved,” DeLaurentis said.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which had advocated for MPD reforms, applauded MPD’s efforts to increase transparency.
“The NAACP supports MPD officers wearing cameras to ensure transparency and accountability of misconduct by both police officers and citizens. These cameras will offer evidence supporting justice for victims of police misconduct and police officers also deserve proof against unjust claims of misconduct,” NAACP D.C. President Akosua Ali said in a statement.
The NAACP has also called for an expanded crisis intervention training program for MPD, changes to the assault on a police officer statute, a requirement that all MPD officers live in the District and an elimination of racial bias in police work.
Despite the improvements, attendees of the rally were hesitant to call the body camera program a triumph, hoping for more sustainable reforms.
“I think that could definitely be a step in the right direction, but I think if they come at it from more of a training perspective, training police officers in terms of privilege and diversity and inclusion, or getting people to be on a commission to investigate crimes that occur between police and civilians, I think coming from that perspective might be a little more sensitive,” Bylis said.
Saturday’s rally was the latest in a series of similar marches in other areas of the city since Brown’s shooting, including through Chinatown, H Street and Adams Morgan, as well as in front of the White House.

The trip from D.C. General Homeless Shelter to Georgetown may only take about 20 minutes, but for Rashema Melson (COL ’18), that journey has been years in the making.
The freshman, who graduated as valedictorian of the District of Columbia’s Anacostia High School in June after being homeless for more than half a decade, now attends Georgetown on a full scholarship.
In a high school where over 80 percent of students ranked below proficient in reading and math, Melson’s story offered a glimpse into the ways hard work can pay off.
“Throughout my journey … I have learned that time doesn’t wait, pity or adjust for or to anyone, and life is not fair. Life is not fair,” Melson said during her valedictory address this spring. Her  enrollment at Georgetown was covered by media outlets across the country.
Melson’s roommate Whitney Wantong (COL ’18) said that she was not aware of Melson’s history when they first moved into their room in August, even though her mother had posted an article about it on Facebook this summer.
“I didn’t realize her story when I met her,” Wantong said. “It was until she told me about it after I noticed different reporters coming to talk to her or film her that she told me why this is all happening. I kind of put two and two together and realized this was the girl my mom had told me about.”
Melson, who ran track in high school, said that she is holding off on getting involved in extracurricular activities at Georgetown, instead choosing to focus on her academics as she gets adjusted to college life.
During high school, Melson lived at D.C. General Homeless Shelter. According to NPR, the shelter, which served as a hospital until 2001, now houses up to 300 adults and 500 children
Although Melson said she never felt unsafe at the shelter, The Washington Post published a report in July citing a number of recurring problems at D.C. General. The article stated that dangerous living conditions at the shelter have caused nearly 30 people over the past two years to be hospitalized or treated. The health concerns include parasites, insect bites, rashes, dirty showers and other problems related to the facility’s poor maintenance.
“You know, you have to look at what you’ve got and be thankful that there is a roof over your head,” Melson said. “I think that when you have your eye on a goal, there is no such thing as a distraction because you really want to get that goal. I don’t think anything really has the power to distract you from it.”
For Melson, that goal is becoming a forensic pathologist to help solve crimes.
“I wanted to work with the dead for some reason after my father’s death,” Melson said “I wanted to get into helping people like family members learn how their family members died or who [committed] the crime.”
Although Melson lives on Georgetown’s campus, her family continues to live at the homeless shelter eight miles away.
“It’s really hard,” Melson’s mother Vanessa Brown told CNN in an interview in late July. “But I just have to let [Rashema] know that no matter what, we still are going to survive.”
Melson’s family found out in the past few months that D.C. General is facing closure and the residents must find new locations to live. According to Melson, her family has yet to find another living situation.
“I haven’t been there [at the shelter] in a couple weeks. And the last time I was, the mayor was there, and he was saying he was going to help people. But I honestly don’t believe that,” Melson said.
In spite of the difficulty facing her family, Melson created the nonprofit Rashema Melson Scholarship Foundation this past summer to help disadvantaged teenagers achieve their goals of going to college. The scholarship will be offered to students across the country after enough money is raised.
Melson said that she started the scholarship foundation as a way to give back after all of the support she has received, and also because she hopes to support people like her who are trying to rise above their circumstances and succeed.
“There’s no limit to where the struggle is, there’s no limit to people who do hard work,” Melson said.
Nicole Berroa (COL ’18), one of Melson’s suitemates during the Community Scholars Program, a five-week academic summer program for incoming freshmen,  said that compassion is an essential part of who Melson is.
“She’s just very giving, very loving and very caring,” Berroa said. “She listens to you. She has a very motherly personality and likes to take care of people.”
Melson will share her story by delivering a keynote address at the Evidence-Based Programs for Children, Youth and Families Fourth Annual D.C. Summit on Oct. 8. The event is sponsored by the D.C. Department of Behavioral Health and will take place at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center near Mt. Vernon Square.
“I plan to encourage people to just keep going,” Melson said. “And I want to encourage people by using my story. You can do anything and can achieve whatever you put your hard work toward.”
Hard work is something Melson knows a good deal about, according to Wantong.
“She’s definitely hardworking. I have seen very few people put as much effort into things as she does,” Wantong said. “And she also has this very positive way of life where she has this good love for herself, a very healthy love for herself.”
 
Correction: The article originally described D.C. General Homeless Shelter as one of Washington, D.C.’s housing projects. A housing project typically refers to housing owned by the government or a nonprofit and rented out at affordable prices to low-income families. D.C. General is a homeless shelter, not a housing project.

a homeless shelter is not a housing project. both of them exist in the district of columbia, but they are very different things. perhaps this error says something about the background of this reporter

Adrianne Hamilton says

DC General was a hospital that was turned into a homeless shelter but is in no way a housing project. Where will Rashema go during the summer? Can’t the university help her family in any way? As an alum I would like to help. How can Rashema be successful if her immediate family has nowhere to live?

“In a high school where over 80 percent of students ranked below proficient in reading and math, Melson’s story offered a glimpse into the ways hard work can pay off.”
Implying that Melson is the only student in her class who worked hard is quite a bold move. While I absolutely tip my hat to Melson and her incredible achievements (which will only accumulate in number as she continues her education), the wording of this sentence seems to suggest that Melson’s classmates weren’t trying, that they weren’t also interested in educational success.
Perhaps such a sentiment was not the intention of the author… and if that is the case, I simply suggest a higher standard of writing quality.

Former White House Press Secretary Jay Carney spoke Monday evening in Gaston Hall about his experiences as the nation’s 29th press secretary and recounted parts of his nearly three-decade career as a journalist for TIME Magazine.
The event, organized by the Georgetown University Lecture Fund, consisted mostly of a student question-and-answer session during which over a dozen students asked Carney questions on topics ranging from the state of the American media to which television show most accurately captured life in the White House.
Carney began the session by speaking about his background as a press secretary. Jerald terHorst, the only other journalist to hold the office of press secretary retired about a month into his job for moral reasons after Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon.
“I wasn’t a typical press secretary,” Carney, who succeeded Robert Gibbs as press secretary in 2011, said. “I hadn’t been a party operative working on campaigns. I hadn’t come from the president’s inner circle of friends or aides. And even though I spent two years working in the White House for the vice president, I was still very much an outsider.”
Carney also spoke about his background as a journalist and how it played into his decisions as press secretary. According to Carney, the way the White House is viewed from the outside does not align with how things actually are on the inside.
“I didn’t know how little I knew as a reporter,” Carney said. “What you find out very early on when you’re inside the White House is just the sheer volume of unbelievably pressing matters that are on the president’s desk every day.”
Before Carney turned to the audience for questions he said that the two biggest challenges during his time as press secretary was the Newtown school shooting and the faults of the Healthcare.gov website, a comment that drew a loud laugh from the crowd.
“Healthcare.gov was entirely our fault,” Carney said. “It was entirely our responsibility and the president took that seriously. There was a period there in October of 2013 when it became clear to everyone, including us, how badly this thing was functioning [and] that it may not work at all.”
Carney briefly discussed the rough relationship the Obama administration had with journalists, especially the White House Press Corps. Journalists frequently complained about access to the president, especially in regards to photography, while Carney held his position as press secretary. A New York Times op-ed by the Associated Press Photography Director in December 2013 criticized the White House for its “Orwellian image control.” During the question-and-answer session Carney said the op-ed was inaccurate.
“My belief is always that the day that the White House Press Corps stops complaining about access is the day we should worry about our democracy. If there is ever a day where they’re happy, we’re screwed,” Carney said.
Carney also emphasized the effect that social media, especially Twitter, has had on the job of the White House press secretary.
“Fires burn a lot more brightly now because of the intensity that Twitter can create, but they burn out more quickly,” Carney said.
Carney ended the discussion with a question from an audience member on how he was able to balance his commitment as a parent with his commitment as the president’s press secretary. Carney said that his decision to play a major role in his two children’s lives was one the main reason he resigned as press secretary a few months ago.
“You guys all have parents, and I know they all feel the same way I do,” Carney said. “You don’t get it back. My daughter is never going to be 9 again. She’s going to be 9 now.”
Nearly 800 students RSVPed for the event on Facebook, although the 750-seat auditorium was not at capacity during the event.
Zhuoyun Liu (MSB ’18) said that she enjoyed listening to Carney speak and thought it was one of the better lectures she has been to this semester.
“It was very interesting and educational,” Liu said. “He’s a really good and fun speaker compared to other speeches I’ve been to this semester. He had more content and there was more to digest.”

Jesuits nationwide are taking action in response to the large-scale child immigration crisis that began this summer as tens of thousands of children — many unaccompanied by parents or guardians — from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Mexico migrated to the United States.
The Jesuit Conference of the United States collaborated with 23 other national faith-based organizations to author a letter addressed to President Barack Obama, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson and Attorney General Eric Holder last week.
“As national faith-based organizations hailing from a diversity of traditions, we write to express our disappointment at the decision to delay acting to provide immigration relief for millions of our fellow community members,” the Sept. 30 letter states.
The letter urges the Obama administration to end deportation practices that make migrants more vulnerable to trafficking, exploitation and violence, change Customs and Border Protection polices, which currently allow lethal use of force, address the lack of accountability and responsiveness to complaints at CBP and end the inhumane practice of family detention.
U.S. Jesuit Conference National Advocacy Office Policy Director Shaina Aber said that these delays and inaction are an infringement of basic human rights.
“It is frankly pretty shameful that our government hasn’t responded to these issues,” Aber said. “It is abhorrent that the U.S. government has chosen to give guidelines to border patrol that are so out of step with their guidelines for other law enforcement agencies. There is simply no political calculus that can justify the loss of human lives because an election season is coming up.”
Currently the Jesuit Conference is waiting for a response from the Obama administration and is working to raise awareness about unsafe deportation practices and the family detention crisis. Many leaders are reaching out to Jesuit parishes, working with Jesuit communities across the United States and conducting meetings with the White House.
While the community awaits an answer from the government, Georgetown theology professor Fr. James Walsh, S.J., said that the Jesuit community has a duty to combat the infringement of immigrant rights.
“When St. Ignatius and his companions started the outfit that would eventually turn into the Jesuit order in the 1530s, central to their identity was that they would go serve and help the most neglected, the most in need. That is central to our identity, historically, and therefore, this is what we are for,” Walsh said.
Walsh said he has abided by the Jesuit call to action by combating critics of religious involvement in immigrant rights through his studies of the Old Testament.
“The best thing any Jesuit can do is to do his work and then make it available to other people, as opposed to direct action,” Walsh said. “The Jesuits are the bridge builders between the church and the world — it is the Jesuits’ duty to go past the ordinary frontier of things.”
Hoyas for Immigrant Rights has also participated in advocacy efforts, holding a vigil in front of the White House on Monday for refugee children from Central American. The vigil occurred in response to the current legislative pause on immigration reform and faulty policy, which will not resume until after the upcoming midterm election.
Kim Maima (SFS ’15), a Hoyas for Immigrant Rights member, said that she attended the vigil to show that she does not support the administration’s policies, which she believes persecute individuals who are fleeing from violence. Maima said that the Jesuit community at the university helped the club plan and execute the vigil.
“Right now the focus of Hoyas for Immigrant Rights is on the crisis of undocumented minors along the border,” Maima said. “We reached out to the Jesuit community on that issue through hosting our vigil, aiming to create an event that was very spiritual, very reflective — different from the events we’ve had in the past, which have been more about advocacy, activism and public demonstration. We want to show them that we have empathy for what they are going through, by standing in solidarity with them.”

Georgetown expanded its massive open online courses this year with two new offerings: “Terrorism and Counter-terrorism,” taught by professor Daniel Byman, and “The Divine Comedy: Dante’s Journey to Freedom,” taught by professor Frank Ambrosio.
The program, conceived last year, also includes an Advanced Placement physics course and a course on globalization, “Globalization’s Winners and Losers: Challenges for Developed and Developing Countries,” which has been revamped from last year. According to Ambrosio, there are currently 10,000 students registered in the MOOC program, across courses. Georgetown presented its first online course last fall to an audience of 14,000 students from across the globe through the website edX and released two other courses in the spring.
This move to incorporate more online offerings follows in line with Georgetown’s wider scheme to include more technology in the classroom, after the university invested $8 million in the Initiative on Technology-Enhanced Learning in fall 2012.
Free and available to all, the courses are not graded and do not grant college credit, but students will be presented with an “Honor Code Certificate” to verify that they have each completed the course requirements.
“The only incentive for participating in one of these is learning,” Ambrosio said.
Faculty interested in teaching an online course are chosen through an application process, based in part on course proposals they submit to the Office of the Provost. Professors who are granted an online course are not paid extra, but the MOOC qualifies as a regular course for professors’ teaching obligations.
Ambrosio’s course offering is split into three courses, with the first section debuting Oct.15, to align with the three books of Dante’s “Divine Comedy.” The course, composed of videos, small assignments and readings, also required the construction of a separate website as a teaching tool.
“It’s kind of an experiment,” Ambrosio said. “We think that the website we designed at Georgetown is something that other teachers at other schools could use to teach not only Dante, and not only Dante with my material, but any other literary work you might want … because it’s not about a specific work of literature but a way of reading literature.”
Ambrosio said that the videos are not recordings of full classes.
“These aren’t lectures though, they’re like five-to-10 minute clips that simply highlight and help emphasize main points in the material,” he added. Byman, who teaches an eight-week course that started on Oct. 1, found the different method of teaching engaging, though was unsure that he would recommend the experience to anyone interested.
“Well it’s exciting to reach so many people — even a big course at Georgetown isn’t close to that, and it’s interesting to try and do it by video. So it’s a different way of learning than a more traditional Socratic method that I take in the classroom,” he said. “It’s not for everyone.”
EdX, the website that hosts Georgetown’s MOOCs, provides part of the work and some of the money for the courses. The rest of the effort comes from the professors and the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship.
“EdX is a big outfit, and they have a platform of their own that provides the framework. … CNDLS has a support team of about eight to 12 people to work with the [Georgetown] professors involved, to figure out the best way to structure the material, produce video that supports the written material, and then get all of that translated into the edX context,” Ambrosio said.
Anna Kruse (COL ’09), the program manager of CNDLS, said that she appreciated the ability of the online courses to reach disparate parts of the world.
“I love seeing the excitement students around the world have as they go through the MOOCs. There’s a lot of enthusiasm and it’s nice to be able share some of the knowledge we have here at Georgetown in the signature areas with students around the world,” she said.
Kruse noted that the courses were constantly in a state of revision, using feedback from students to improve the courses. The globalization course was revamped this year in response to student feedback.
“We’ve included more content on the developing world and were also experimenting with smaller groups for conversation this time around,” she said.
Despite the reach of the online courses, Ambrosio noted that the MOOCs did not provide the same experience as a regular course at the university.
“They are not designed to replace classroom courses. They’re not designed to provide college credit, they’re designed to share knowledge, learning, with as many people as possible, to try to figure out the most effective way to do that,” he said.
Byman agreed that the courses were not as rigorous as classes taught on campus.
“In terms of how demanding it is, its level of evaluation is nowhere close to a regular Georgetown class,” he said.

The Catholic University of America cancelled a “Milk and Cookies” event last minute Wednesday, during which the movie “Milk,” about LGBTQ rights activist Harvey Milk, would be shown in honor of the OUTober LGBTQ Awareness Month.
“We were completely shocked that that happened,” Catholic University College Democrats communications representative Jackson Tovar, a sophomore, said. The College Democrats were to sponsor the event.
The university said the event was postponed due to a miscommunication between the College Democrats and the administration surrounding the intention behind the event.
“For university administrators, it called into question whether the event had changed in nature from one of education to one of advocacy,” university spokesperson Victor Nakas said in a statement. “Given the confusion caused by the advertising, the Office of the Dean of Students contacted the College Democrats to postpone the event.”
Set to begin Wednesday at 6 p.m., the event would have featured the screening of “Milk,” a documentary detailing the life of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay elected official in America. Milk, a San Francisco supervisor, was assassinated in 1978. The movie would have been preceded by introductory speeches by CUA alum Kevin Walling, chairman of the Democratic Party in Montgomery County, Md., as well as the first LGBTQ party chair, and John Whyte, a professor of politics at CUA, on how the LGBTQ movement has shaped the Democratic Party.
According to Tovar, however, the event was cancelled, not postponed, and there is no planning underway for a similar future event.
“We have not put any planning into rescheduling the event nor is there an event on the calendar,” Tovar said.
Tovar said that he did not completely understand what the university meant by “advocacy,” but maintained that the event was intended to promote awareness about the LGBTQ community, not advocate for anything.
“The College Democrats were not going to impose beliefs on anybody. We were not going to advocate for official rights, or homosexual marriage, or anything of that matter, strictly awareness,” Tovar said. “And [LGBTQ] awareness is a very important issue, whether it’s suicide rates among identifiers of [LGBTQ] or whether it’s showing ‘Milk’, the harassment, the bullying, and also the assassination that this elected official went through. Just purely, purely awareness, and no advocacy whatsoever.”
He said that College Democrats had gone through all of the proper channels to have the event approved by the university administration, including having the speakers and flyers approved by the Office of Campus Activities.
The group distributed flyers, which were initially approved at the same time as the event, for the event that said “Kick off LGBT Awareness Month with The CUA College Democrats.”
“It had a stamp of approval that any flyer that is publicized on campus needs to have. The administrators were caught in a lie with their official statement and official reasoning. It’s more likely that the administrators had a problem with either me coming back to speak or the general topic itself,” Walling said.
Tovar said that he thought the flyers were clear on what the event would entail.
“In my opinion there was no miscommunication between the college democrats and the administration because we made it pretty clear that our event was for awareness, and that we wrote ‘LGBT awareness month’ on our posters,” Tovar said.
Though he does not identify as LGBTQ, Tovar has not observed any homophobic harassment between students on campus.
“Though it’s a Catholic school, there is an [LGBTQ] community on campus. And I don’t think there’s any hostility toward the students from other students. I don’t identify [LGBTQ] myself so I can’t fully say what they go through everyday, but there is a community, there is a presence,” Tovar said.
According to Walling, Catholic University recognized an on-campus LGBTQ group starting in the 1980s up until the about 10 years ago, but an LGBTQ group has not been recognized since.
The Organization for Gay and Lesbian Rights, which existed on Catholic University’s campus from 1988 to 2002, was disbanded after the group saw a decline in membership as well as increased animosity that picked up as the national marriage equality movement began to grow. When Catholic University students attempted to start a new LGBTQ support group, called CUAllies, in 2009, the group again saw hostility from the community, prompting another decline in membership.
“There have been numerous efforts to re-charter the organization as a meeting space for LGBT Catholics to talk about their faith and to talk about their sexual orientation or gender identity in an open, supporting atmosphere,” Walling said.
Despite Catholic University’s identity as a pontifical university, meaning that it has received papal approval and abides by Catholic doctrine, Walling pushed for a more accepting campus environment for students who identify as LGBTQ. Georgetown University is of Catholic and Jesuit affiliation, but has not received papal approval and is not obligated to follow Catholic doctrine.
“It speaks to a greater narrative here at Catholic U that instead of embracing diversity and creating a supporting environment … it shouldn’t be the case that we’re canceling [LGBTQ] advocacy events and it shouldn’t be the case that we don’t have a single [LGBTQ] organization on campus as a resource for students,” Walling said.
Walling conveyed his disappointment in his alma mater.
“That the university is scared of this topic in 2014 is pretty disheartening, especially given the views of the Holy Father. Pope Francis said, ‘Who am I to judge?’ At Catholic, it appears the administration is who to judge, and that’s disappointing,” Walling said.

The state of California redefined the law of consent for sexual activity on college campuses to require affirmative consent in a piece of legislation entitled “Yes Means Yes.”
Under the new legislation, for two parties to engage in sexual activity, there must be, “an affirmative, unambiguous, and conscious decision,” from each party. Additionally, each party can revoke that consent at any time.
Setting the legislation apart from the “no means no” definition of consent, the legislation specifically outlines that consent does not include lack of protest and cannot be given if someone is asleep or under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
“The State of California will not allow schools to sweep rape cases under the rug,” California State Senator Kevin de León, who introduced the bill, said in a statement.
The bill further requires colleges to put rules in place that protect the privacy of survivors, train campus officials, and provide counseling for survivors.
Laura Kovach, director of the Georgetown University’s Women’s Center, applauded the legislation, adding that she hoped that more states would follow California’s footsteps.
“I believe that everyone is paying attention to what California has done and we may see more states, and perhaps the Federal government, move in the direction of Yes Means Yes legislation,” Kovach wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Sarah Rabon (COL ’16), president of Take Back the Night, a student advocacy group combatting sexual assault, praised the “Yes Means Yes” legislation as clearing up ambiguities that were present in the “no means no” definition of consent, which can cause sexual assault trials on college campuses to be dismissed too easily.
“Consent is about the presence of a ‘yes,’ not the absence of a ‘no.’ ‘No means no’ definitions can sometimes ignore or discredit survivors of sexual assault that were unable to vocalize their lack of consent,” Rabon wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Rabon explained the importance of the guidelines set forth by the legislation in addressing the full range of problems behind sexual assault.
“Fear, drugs, coercion and unconsciousness are just a few examples of things that can keep a survivor from vocalizing their lack of consent, but that doesn’t mean they were not assaulted or traumatized,” Rabon wrote.
“‘No’ does mean no. For me there is no debate about that. However this legislation recognizes that the majority of assaults happen between people who know each other and that consent must be achieved at every point. Hearing yes is affirming,” Kovach wrote.
Although Georgetown University’s sexual assault policy does not explicitly articulate California’s “Yes Means Yes” policy of consent, it does employ similar language as the legislation’s requirement of affirmative consent.
According to the University policy on Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Assault, consent is defined as “an understandable exchange of affirmative words or actions that indicate a willingness to participate in mutual agreed upon sexually explicit touching or sexual penetration.” The Code of Student Conduct defines consent as “words or overt actions indicating a freely given agreement to the sexual act or sexual contact in question.”
Also in accordance with the California legislation, Georgetown’s policy specifically states that if one of the individuals changes his or her mind during the sexual activity, the consent is rescinded.
The Yes Means Yes legislation falls in line with the “It’s On Us” initiative recently launched by the White House to urge colleges to assess the extent of sexual assault on their campuses and take steps to prevent it.
“So the goal is to hold ourselves and each other accountable, and to look out for those who don’t consent and can’t consent. And anybody can be a part of this campaign,” President Barack Obama said at the launch event for the initiative. California universities, including Occidental College, University of California-Berkeley and University of Southern California, were included in the list release in May of the 55 colleges and universities under federal investigation for the mishandling of sexual assault cases last year. Georgetown was not on that list.
However, Kovach emphasized that the work done by the Women’s Center and student organizations on campus was still unfinished.
“We need to continue our work to educate about consent and the importance of healthy communication,” wrote Kovach.

Karen Gale, a professor of pharmacology and neuroscience at Georgetown for 37 years, lived her life as a mentor to her students, colleagues and daughters, with a devotion to fostering creativity, thinking outside of the box and promoting diversity wherever she went. Gale died Aug. 21 from cancer at a hospital in Washington., D.C. She was 65.
Gale joined the faculty at Georgetown University Medical Center’s department of pharmacology and physiology in 1977, leading a research program that focused on the neuropharmacology of basal ganglia in the brain. Gale’s work allowed her to rise through the ranks of faculty and become a full professor in 1988.
According to her daughter Justine Underhill (COL ’11), Gale’s inspiring commitment to creativity and innovation led to major accomplishments in the lab, care for her students and role as a devoted mother. Underhill said Gale constantly encouraged others to go above and beyond their expectations of themselves, allowing them to reach new levels of understanding and achievement.
“She was a neuroscientist but also an artist and a performer,” Underhill said.  “She went to a high school for music and art so that greatly impacted all of her science and how she raised my sister and I with a love of theater, art and music.”
According to Underhill, Gale’s creativity made her both an excellent teacher and mother.
“She really thought outside the box,” Underhill said. “She had a very different way of thinking and constantly challenging the status quo that extended from her art and her creativity.”
Gale made two pivotal discoveries in the early 1980s, including the substantia nigra pars reticula, a key basal ganglia output nucleus in the brain as well as a highly circumscribed region within piriform cortex, a critical site for seizure initiation.
Her early successes led to her incredible achievements, having published 175 papers and received $10,000,000 in research and training funding over her lifetime. In the last 10 years, Gale focused on researching the effects of anticonvulsant drugs on brain development and has been recognized as an expert in seizure circuitry.
Barry Wolfe, who began working as a professor of pharmacology at Georgetown in 1989, was Gale’s colleague for 25 years. In 1993, they developed the Interdisciplinary Program in Neuroscience, a graduate program not operating under a specific department and currently in its 20th year. Gale was the director of the IPN for 9 years and served as the dean of admissions for IPN for the last 10 years of her life.
“In 1994, Karen ran for the election for director of the IPN and won it,” Wolfe said.  “When the results were announced, she hugged me and cried and said, ‘this is my lifetime ambition.’ It really was. She put her all into that program for many years and took it from essentially nothing up to the 14th-ranked program in the country. It was mostly because of her unlimited energy.”
According to Wolfe, Gale showcased her dedication to students and passion for the program during her time as the dean of admissions.
“She would reach out to potential applicants and by the time they came to interview they would realize that this is the place for them. They realized this was a really good place that really cared about students,” Wolfe said.
Patrick Forcelli (GRD ’11), Gale’s former postdoctoral student and colleague said Gale was extremely generous with her time and wholeheartedly devoted herself to her students, guiding them and urging them to reach their full potentials. Forcelli said he looked up to Gale’s mentorship and strengths as a scientist.
“She had such a big picture view of neuroscience and pharmacology,” Forcelli said. “The aspect of her science that always impressed me was that she always went where the data took her, even if she found something surprising.”
According to Forcelli, Gale served as an incredible teacher and mentor to each of her students.
“She was an amazing mentor,” Forcelli said. “Every person we have graduated from the IPN had her as a first contact. Personally, I wouldn’t be where I am without her and I know that is true for many of my science brothers and sisters. We learned so incredibly much from her.”
Gale also spent hours helping students with grants and papers, Forcelli said.
“She was so generous with her time and once she took an interest in somebody, she was 100 percent committed,” Forcelli said. “There was no getting away from it because she was going to care about you. She without a doubt had a huge impact on students, faculty, and everybody that she came in contact with.”
Gale’s passions extended beyond science and teaching; she was also a fierce proponent of women’s rights. Gale helped found Georgetown Women in Medicine, a group that promotes the professional advancement of women faculty at the Georgetown University Medical Center.
“She was incredibly passionate about helping the development of women faculty and underrepresented minority faculty members,” Forcelli said.
Gale also had high hopes to invite more females in neuroscience to campus to speak. University President John J. DeGioia posthumously awarded Gale the President’s Award for Distinguished Scholar-Teachers on Sept. 26, and created “The Karen Gale Memorial Lecture Fund for Women in Neuroscience” to fulfill Gale’s wish.
Underhill said Gale constantly challenged those around her to succeed and improve in new and innovative ways.
“When working with her, you realize there is always another level that you can reach,” Underhill said. “She was always challenging me to go beyond whatever was expected. I was one of her students in that way.”
 
Correction: An earlier version of this article misspelled “basal ganglia” as “basil” ganglia.

Student clubs have had difficulty accessing and managing their finances due to glitches in the Georgetown Management System since a June update to the cloud-based site. Problems have also stemmed from an increased volume of activity, with 1,174 additional users joining in June alone, according to GMS.
These changes have temporarily barred student groups from accessing their finances and tracking records kept by the Center for Student Engagement on HoyaLink.
HoyaLink Finance, which is operated by GMS, has faced technical errors recently, and often is unavailable for students.
In a statement on GMS’s website, Vice President of Finance and University Treasurer David Rubenstein said that the system is experiencing delays in invoice processing, issues with data conversion and troubles with viewing research and start-up funds. “Overall, from a system perspective, the financial system is working as planned,” Rubenstein wrote. “Any downtime has been minimal and the system is quite responsive, despite the volume of activity.  However, we are aware of some issues that have come up primarily in three areas.”
Joseph Laposata (COL ’16), treasurer of the Georgetown University College Democrats, said the lack of HoyaLink Finance has made it difficult to balance the organization’s finances.
“The absence of HoyaLink Finance is preventing me from doing my job the best I can, because I have no way of detecting discrepancies between how much money I think we’ve spent and how much money CSE thinks we’ve spent,” Laposata said.
Laposata added that overall, he still thinks the new system has potential, and that the problems may just be an issue of poor execution.
“The new system isn’t the end of the world, and I’m sure it provides a legitimate service to CSE,” Laposata said. “However, as far as I can see on my end, it’s an annoyance, another line of red tape to deal with.”
Running Club Treasurer Alden Fletcher (SFS ’17) said that he has not had access to real-time budget information through HoyaLink Finance all semester.
“I don’t know how much I’ve taken out, how much I’ve put in. What I’ve been going by for now is just my own bookkeeping,” Fletcher said. “It’s a source of worry, not having that indicator of how well we’re doing with the finances.”
Fletcher said that he has been in touch with the CSE about the inconvenience.
“We were aware, and CSE told us that it would take them a while to put up the budget.”
Curt Topper, Assistant Vice President for Purchasing, Contracts and Accounts Payable, attributed these issues in the system to the natural adjustment to new protocols.
“It is to be expected when undertaking a system conversion for something as large and complex as a university financial system that there will be some issues that crop up upon conversion,” Topper wrote in an email to The Hoya.
According to Topper, staff members have been working to speed up invoice processing and to reconvert data to resolve grant issues. Additionally, faculty who need information about balances have been able to access it from GMS using alternative methods.
Topper said that the updating system to be a cloud-based program was a necessary progression for GMS to accommodate the needs of the community.
“With the new system, we will continue to grow more efficient and identify potential cost savings opportunities over time,” Topper wrote.
Alyssa Russell (COL ’17), one of the Welcome Week student coordinators, said while the new system caused some delays in transferring money to student groups during the week of events last month. She added that she does not think this new system will have a noticeable impact on planning in the future.
“I did not notice any changes to GMS that were major benefits for the planning of Welcome Week but there weren’t any negative consequences that I observed either,” Russell said.

Adelina Lancianese says 
October 7, 2014 at 10:33 pm
Alyssa Russell’s quote was a much-needed and vastly important contribution to this article; and I feel as if my time was best served dissecting it for its economic brilliant. Ms. Russell is a talented young mind, akin to those of Paul Krugman or Max Weber and a true Hoya treasure, Her skill and organization of Welcome Week added a whole new dimension to the event and I cannot wait to see what else she has in store in her time at Georgetown. Russell’s critique of GMS was well-founded and I’m sure it will be the basis for many more debates. The Hoya should consider her as a staffer or perhaps senior editor.

After the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity house at Emory University was vandalized with swastikas on Sunday following Yom Kippur, the Georgetown chapter of AEPi will wear blue on Tuesday in solidarity and in a statement against anti-Semitism.
“We’re trying to show support for the brothers at that chapter and stand up against anti-Semitism by wearing blue, which is one of the colors of AEPi nationally,” Josh Milgrom (MSB ’15), president of Georgetown’s AEPi Eta Sigma chapter said. “We’re just trying to … show the entire college community that these acts won’t be tolerated and have no place on any college campus.”
According to Milgrom, AEPi’s executive director sent an email to every chapter in the country, encouraging their members to wear blue.
“Hopefully this will turn into a national thing across every college campus where there’s an AEPi chapter,” Milgrom said.
Members of Emory’s Student Government Association wore blue in solidarity with the fraternity on Monday.
Ben Reiser (COL ’17), a member of AEPi’s Georgetown chapter, said that he was excited to bring the movement to Georgetown.
“We wanted to show that there are other people in AEPi and in the Jewish community elsewhere in the country showing their support,” Reiser said.
AEPi invited all members of the Georgetown community to demonstrate their support by wearing blue on Tuesday.
“This is really our way of making a statement by saying that these hate crimes are inexcusable,” Reiser said.
Milgrom said that the Georgetown chapter has no further plans to address the anti-Semetic vandalism at Emory University.

President Barack Obama announced his endorsement for Washington, D.C. Democratic mayoral candidate Muriel Bowser on Monday.
“As we continue our efforts to move our country’s economy forward, I know I’ll be able to count on Muriel to expand opportunity for all,” Obama said in the statement. “That’s why I’m asking for you to vote for her in the general election this November.”
According to a poll released Wednesday conducted by Economic Growth D.C., Ward 4 councilmember Bowser has amassed the support of 35 percent of voters. Fellow mayoral candidates, D.C. councilmember David Catania and former councilmember Carol Schwartz, both independents, followed behind with 27 percent and 11 percent, respectively.
“I am extremely honored to receive President Obama’s endorsement. We share a progressive vision, believing that we only succeed when opportunity is available to everyone,” Bowser said in a press release. “If the residents of the District of Columbia elect me to be their next mayor on November 4th, I will emulate the President by bringing people together to find solutions to our toughest challenges.”
Obama praised Bowser for entering into a career in politics from a middle-class background, as he did.
“I am proud to endorse Democratic Councilmember Muriel Bowser in her mayoral election bid. She is a champion for working and middle-class families, and a passionate proponent of Washington, D.C.,” Obama said in the statement.
Georgetown University College Democrats Chair Chandini Jha (COL ’16) thought that their similarity in upbringing could have motivated Obama to choose to endorse her.
“I think to him, perhaps, Muriel Bowser, coming from the, starting from the beginning, without having any political dynasty she’s following and not having any big city politics, or machine politics, kind of echoes Obama’s story of coming from working-class America to a single mother, and then being the president of the United States,” Jha said.
Jha added that she thought the endorsement would be a significant help to Bowser’s campaign.
“I think it’s more of a symbolic gesture than anything, but it’s a symbolic gesture for Obama that can have real results in this race. Like it’s definitely going to help voter turnout for Muriel Bowser,” Jha said.
The D.C. mayoral election will take place Nov. 4.

The Office of Residential Living conducted health and safety inspections in all on-campus residences last week, and will continue through this Friday. At least two staff members can enter dorm rooms any time between 10 a.m. and 9 p.m. to look for prohibited items and safety concerns in plain sight.
Although this was common practice in the past, no health and safety inspections were performed last year.
According to Associate Director of Residential Services Matthew Hollingshead, mid-semester inspections failed to happen last year because the Office of Residential Living was, at that time, newly merged with Housing Operations and Residents’ Life.
As both departments used to conduct the impromptu visits together, the recent restructuring disrupted last year’s scheduled inspections.
“The Office of Residential Living just started its second year of existence. So we were consolidating a lot of our processes and procedures last year,” Hollingshead said. “The inspection wasn’t reimagined under the new department.”
Hollingshead added that the inspections have been a common occurrence in past years to keep the campus safe.
“We hope these policies will be followed all the time. The announcement is just out of precaution,” he said. “This is something that is done naturally. It’s not new to Georgetown. It’s not a new trend in higher education in general. It’s something that we need to ensure the safety for our students.”
Madeline Sposato (SFS ’17) of Reynolds Hall said she was frustrated about the inconsistency of these inspections.
“As far as the purpose is looking for prohibited items, safety and facilities concerns, I can understand why they would choose to do the safety inspection,” Sposato said. “But the fact that they didn’t do one last year and they decided to do one this year doesn’t seem very consistent to me. I’m more bothered by the inconsistency than I am by the inspection itself.”
Prohibited items include, but are not limited to, extension cords, space heaters, pets, explosives, electric cooking appliances and candles. Upon completion of the inspection, staff members will leave a checklist and follow up with the students found violating residential policies.
Hollingshead explained the right of staff members to enter residential spaces.
“Any staff members, according to the housing agreement, are allowed to enter any residential space,” Hollingshead said. “We obviously have the discretion to do that. We do it when we have a reason to do it: health and safety is one of the reasons, and also in cases of emergency.”
Although Hollingshead admitted that the staff members would still abide by the regular policy, including reporting alcohol found in freshman dorms, he emphasized that this was not the purpose of the inspection.
“We are not here to cause problems. We are not here to get people in trouble. Our purpose is safety,” he said.
Mark Gori (MSB ’18), a resident of Darnall Hall, said that he feels that this inspection is an unnecessary invasion of privacy, and doubts the inspection has a safety-only focus.
“I know it’s allowed. I don’t prefer it. I’d rather not have people in my room and open my stuff,” Gori said. “At first they are listing things like extension cords, all the normal prohibited things, but they are probably looking for basically everything that they can confiscate.”
Hollingshead noted that the health and safety inspection will be a regular practice in the future, occurring once each semester.
“It is expected for people living in dorms,” Zhuoyun Liu (MSB ’18) of Village C West noted. “From my experience, I’m not that surprised. I think it’s good and it’s made pretty clear that this is for the general safety of the entire building,”

In light of recent student media reports of harassment and catcalling directed at female students by construction workers on campus, Georgetown administrators have contacted the Whiting-Turner Contracting Company this week to denounce the practice and prevent its recurrence.
Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey sent a letter to the contractor Oct. 2, highlighting the contractual agreement and the policy statement on sexual misconduct. Morey also conducted direct conversations with contractors to highlight the issue.
“It is important for me to clearly and simply state our expectation that such behavior is unacceptable and will be treated with zero tolerance,” Morey wrote. “I trust that we can partner to proactively establish the desired environment on our job sites and reject a ‘boys will be boys’ culture.”
Students reported catcalls and harassment from construction workers on campus beginning in the summer and continuing into the school year. Morey noted that no specific action would be taken since the reports did not point to exact incidents of misconduct, but noted that the harassment violates the university’s contract with Whiting-Turner.
“The contractor shall enforce strict discipline and good order among the contractor’s employees and other persons carrying out the work,” the contract states. “Any contractor or subcontractor shall have courteous and respectful behavior with university faculty, staff and students.”
Morey also included the university’s policy statement on sexual misconduct in his letter.
University spokesperson Stacy Kerr said that the response to the letter from contractors was swift and decisive.
“Many of the contractors immediately responded to the letter, articulating the seriousness with which they also take this matter and the steps they are taking to address this with their employees,” Kerr wrote in an email to student media. “We were encouraged that some contractors have their own individual sexual harassment training programs that they are reinforcing our expectations with their employees.”

As the region struggles to recover from the recession, the poverty rate in Washington, D.C., which has steadily risen since 2007, reached 18.9 percent in 2013, a marginal increase from the previous year, according to recent findings from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey.
The survey revealed that about 115,550 D.C. residents were living below the poverty line in 2013. The percentage marked an increase from 16.4 percent in 2007 and from 18.2 percent in 2012.
Jenny Reed, deputy director of the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute, stressed the problems resulted from the District’s trend of rising poverty.
“Not only is the recovery not reaching a large share of D.C. families, changes to D.C.’s economy are actually making it harder for many residents to maintain their foothold,” Reed said in a press release. “Wages have fallen, and jobs are scarce for residents without a college degree, making it harder to afford the basics like housing and food.”
Despite the small difference between 2012 and 2013, professor of public policy at the McCourt School of Public Policy Harry Holzer addressed the negative consequences of high poverty rates on trends in employment among the city’s poor. Of the 88,773 people living in poverty over the age of 16, only 1.9 percent had a full-time job throughout the year, while 64.6 percent did not work at all in 2013.
“The rise in poverty in Washington, D.C., between 2012 and 2013 was not statistically significant. The biggest set of factors that affected poverty were those of the labor market. Because people were dropping out of the job market, not only did unemployment fall, but actual employment fell as well,” Holzer said.
Despite the significant poverty, the median household income for the District of $67,572 was the third-highest of all metropolitan areas in the country, behind only the San Francisco Bay Area and New York City.
Divergent experiences existed within the city itself. Wards 1, 5 and 6 saw a decline in poverty from 22 percent to 12 percent. Wards 7 and 8, however, saw their poverty rates reach nearly one-third of the population. The survey revealed that approximately 75 percent of the people living in poverty in D.C. are African-American.
“I used to think the Southeast was bad, but everywhere east of the Anacostia River suffers from poverty. To me, poverty means a lack of resources, and there are no resources in those areas,” Alexia Currie (COL ’16), a coordinator for the D.C. Reads program, said.
This income disparity is often a direct result of educational disparities. In 2012, more than one in three residents without a college degree lived below the poverty line. According to a 2013 Census Bureau survey, just over 22 percent of residents with a high school diploma lived in poverty in 2012, and D.C. residents with a bachelor’s degree or higher saw a poverty rate of just 5 percent that same year.
Community organizers have noticed the increase, particularly in children who do not have access to as many educational opportunities.
Tina Beeks, an employee at Paradise Community Center in Ward 7, identified the high price of higher education as a common obstacle for lower-income adolescents trying to attend university.
“Over the years, we have gotten many more kids coming to [the Paradise Community Center], especially in the summer. The worst thing about college is how expensive it is,” Beeks said.
D.C. has also demonstrated the high economic stratification within the District. According to Forbes’ “America’s Richest Counties 2014,” six of the 10 richest counties in America encircle the Washington metropolitan area, including Fairfax County, Va., and Loudon County, Va. Holzer attributes this suburban wealth to those who hold high-profile careers in D.C. and choose to live in counties outside of the District.
“Many people of high education, who have law degrees, Ph.D.s, or who work in think tanks, commute into Washington for work, but do not live there. Poverty rates are based on residencies, not workplaces,” Holzer said.

If I remember correctly, one of the DC Reads’ training maxims is “THE Southeast bad.” 
….What the shit is going on in that Center for “Social Justice”?

This article is terrible. 
Alexia how embarrassing for you to be quoted saying something so utterly disjointed, generalized, and uninformed.  Lucky for you, most people who read it will have no idea or won’t care.  I want to give you the benefit of the doubt by assuming that the Hoya (in classic Hoya form) misquoted you.  Regardless of whether they chopped your words,  you should probably not give quotes to the paper in the future when you have no idea what you are talking about. As someone who works in W7 and W8, you need to be more intentional when you speak if you’re trying to act as an ambassador or an educator to the Georgetown community.  Your comment is neither informational nor helpful. Poverty has a definition, and while you have an interesting interpretation, it is the wrong / (at best, incomplete) interpretation of the actual definition.  But again, crappy article overall Hoya. Do better or don’t do it at all.
Also, speaking of less education opportunities in W7 and W8, DC Reads pulled out of the Paradise / Parkside neighborhood program this summer without appropriately informing the director of the community programs. The summer program at Paradise had run successfully for 3+ years, giving great opportunities to Georgetown students and Parkside students. Terrible partnership building on the CSJ’s part, an embarrassment to the foundations of strong social justice work, plus just plain disrespectful.

Jairam Ramesh, a member of India’s Parliament and a senior political leader in the Indian National Congress Party, spoke about the need for climate change policy in a lecture hosted by the Georgetown-India Dialogue and the School of Foreign Service Asian Studies Program in the Intercultural Center auditorium on Friday.
Ramesh, who negotiated for India at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, spoke about the struggles that policy makers face when trying to find a diplomatic solution to climate change.
“We get it that climate change is here,” Ramesh said. “There are people still in the world who deny the signs of climate change. But my talk is based on the assumption backed by robust scientific evident that climate change is not a hoax, it is not an exaggeration, that global warming is a reality.”
Ramesh, a former minister who held the environment and forests and rural development portfolios, said that this type of climate change is, for the first time, created by humans, instead of natural processes. Despite changes in scientists’ understanding of climate change and increased evidence of its anthropogenic causes, negotiations have remained the same.
“We have yet to discover an economic model that is decoupled from pollution, and economic model that is decoupled from deforestation and an economic model that is decoupled from carbon emissions,” Ramesh said. “The paradox is the world has changed from 1992 but the negotiating framework remains ossified in a world of 1992.”
Ramesh also highlighted the fact that different countries handle climate change in different ways, using the term “common but differentiated responsibilities.”
“It means that we all have common, we are all in this together because climate change is a common responsibility, so it is a common responsibility but it is a differentiated responsibility,” Ramesh said. “What that CBDR is has been left delightfully vague to be interpreted by countries as they chose to see fit.”
Ramesh argued that the problem with this is that different countries have interpreted CBDR in different ways, but said he hopes for a universal solution within the next year.
“In Paris in 2015, it is widely expected that the international community will finally come up with an international agreement, with a global agreement,” Ramesh said. “It would send a clear signal to the world that every country is going to take on some responsibility or the other to do its bit to control global warming.”
Ramesh said that as this conference approaches, policymakers face a “trilemma” between the architecture of the agreement, differentiation between countries and legal implications.
“All three are important,” Ramesh said. “You have to have an agreement that is politically feasible, you have to have an agreement that is economically desirable because you have to have economic growth to generate jobs you can’t do that without economic growth. And you need an agreement that is also environmentally optimal.”
Jeh Tirodkar, a founding member of the Georgetown-India Dialogue, said that the group brought Ramesh to campus due to his background in economics, politics and climate change diplomacy.
“With his knowledge on the issue and the experiences he has at Copenhagen he is one of the foremost authorities on climate change,” Tirodkar wrote in an email to The Hoya. “More importantly, the thought of Mr. Ramesh being the first politician The Georgetown-India Dialogue brought to campus made perfect sense.”
Paul Selling (COL ‘18) said he thought the event was interesting because it explained the United States’ precarious situation in the climate change crisis.
“What particularly interested me was the difficulties with the framework,” Selling said. “Right now, we are based on stock and flow, but the current framework is requiring the United States to have a larger commitment to stopping the fossil fuels while other countries who are contributing to the flow don’t have to do that right now.”
