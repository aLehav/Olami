GUSA and university administrators are in the process of addressing some of the 120 recommendations that have been made on Georgetown’s IdeaScale, an online forum for student feedback.
Launched in February 2012 as a joint project by the Georgetown University Student Association and Chief Operating Officer Chris Augostini, the site aims to facilitate discussion between students and administrators about how to address student needs.
Georgetown’s Chief Innovation Officer Michael Wang (MSB ’07) discussed the program’s important role in reimagining technology at Georgetown during the inaugural h.Innovation Summit this past April.
“We want students to be able to see what’s happening and see their ideas being worked in the system,” Wang said.
Students can submit ideas online, rate them with a “thumbs up” or “thumbs down” and leave comments. These interactive features allow GUSA and university administrators to pinpoint the most popular, heavily-supported ideas.
Though university administrators are responsible for officially monitoring the forum, GUSA members use the site to gauge students’ interests, according to GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13).
Gustafson added that IdeaScale has proven helpful to the Disciplinary Review Committee, which is advocating to change the “more likely than not” evidentiary standard in the Code of Student Conduct to “clear and convincing evidence.”
According to Gustafson, the GUSA executive decided to post about the code on IdeaScale when it became clear last April that the university planned to delay implementation of the new policy until the fall. With 346 votes, the post is currently the most popular on the site.
“It’s another way to show [that] not just two students care about this or 10 students care about this,” Gustafson said. “This is something the whole school is behind.”
Currently, other popular posts on the site include suggestions for a better book buyback program, a more versatile flex dollar system, a new housing website and more meal-plan options.
Despite GUSA’s support for the forum, some students were unaware that it is a viable resource.
“I didn’t know the site was there, but hearing about the discussions taking place, it’s obvious that students are better able to comminicate their needs with administrators. Otherwise, how else would they know that we need another Grab ’n’ Go location or more seating on the quad?” Rebecca Aklilu(MSB ’15) said.
The site has been most successful in implementing technological changes. The expansion of the campus wireless network and the launch of Georgetown’s mobile application both started as Idea-Scale posts.
“This is obviously a better medium for campus dialogue, as some of these posts have already been addressed,” Mathew Hoffman (COL ’14) said.
But some students who have heard back from the administration about their posts haven’t seen any tangible results, and many others have not received any response at all. At press time, 120 ideas had been posted on the site; 11 had been marked as “complete,” nine as “in review” and five as “in progress.”
Scott Romberg (COL ’13) posted an idea regarding milk dispensers at O’Donovan Hall in late June. While visiting the University of Michigan, he noticed that the milk dispensers in its dining hall included a sign students could slide to alert dining hall workers when dispensers were empty. Romberg said implementing a similar system at Leo’s would solve a persistent communication delay between students and workers.
The idea has 74 votes, and Romberg received a response from ARAMARK Executive Director of Campus Dining Services Andrew Lindquist on July 2.
“[Lindquist] said thank you for the recommendation and ‘We’ll look into it,’” Romberg said. “I was impressed I heard back from them … but it hasn’t been implemented.”
Other students believe that IdeaScale can be improved.
“I think that ideas that get traction on IdeaScale should be acted on quicker and more forcefully,” said Chris Stromeyer (SFS ’14), who has posted to propose changes regarding restricted access to speaking events and the Blackboard Mobile Learn website. “[Popular ideas] should get immediate attention at the highest levels, and that is not yet happening.”

Einstein Bros. Bagels opened a new location in Regents Hall last Wednesday, just a minute’s walk from Uncommon Grounds.
Like Einstein’s other location in Car Barn, this shop is self service, with only one employee managing the register.
“Dining Services was glad to enhance quick food options at this part of campus and offer service in our newest building and student study space,” Associate Vice President for Auxiliary Services Margie Bryant wrote in an email.
According to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, the Science Center Planning Committee, which was responsible for allocating space in Regents, wanted to include a food outlet in the new building. The committee looked to Car Barn’s bagel shop as a good example of utilizing a small amount of space and felt that opening another store was a feasible option.
“The committee thought a similar Einstein Bros. would work well in the limited space,” Pugh wrote in an email. “As I understand it, [the committee] also considered The Corp, but the space is very small — just a counter against the wall.”
Although the new store is close to Uncommon Grounds, Students of Georgetown, Inc. CEO Mike West (COL ’13) said that he does not anticipate a decrease in business.
“We don’t see it as too much of a threat,” he said. “It’s a different market. It seems like they’re much more geared for the ‘grab and go.’”
West added that Uncommon Grounds resembles a storefront and provides students with an area to socialize, while Einstein’s serves students who are on the move.
“You come in and you want to stay a while [at Uncommon Grounds], while at [Einstein’s] you just want to grab a bagel and run,” he said.
While The Corp will be opening a new location in the New South Student Center, West said that the student-run business never considered adding a location in Regents, primarily because of its proximity to Uncommon Grounds.
Students are glad to have both options available to them.
“It’s really convenient,” Mika Nur (MSB ’15) said. “It’s a nice little bite between classes. There are substantial lines at UG, so I go there with friends for social things.”
Students were also pleased that the new Einstein Bros. location is so centrally located.
“I love Einstein’s,” Taylor Stevens (COL ’16) said. “Car Barn is out of the way, so it’s nice to have the option here. It would be better if it were a full store.”
The Einstein’s in Car Barn will be expanding to become a fully staffed shop at some point in the future, according to the university’s dining website. The website does not provide an expected timeline for this change.

Two months after increasing D.C. Metro fares by an average of 5 percent, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced last week that it ended fiscal year 2012 with a $28 million surplus.
The fare increase is the third in the last five years, in accordance with the Metro Board of Directors’ 2008 decision to increase fares approximately every two years.
According to a report in The Washington Examiner, the fare increase, which went into effect July 1, could not be avoided, even though a surplus was likely, because the surplus projections were only a forecast.
In a Sept. 10 press release, WMATA attributed the savings to an audit of the eligibility of health care benefit recipients on its staff and to fuel hedging, which solidified a new cost-cutting rate.
The rate hikes, which included a $1 surcharge on paper fare cards in an effort to reduce costs, have drawn criticism from the Georgetown community.
Kate Dylewsky (COL ’13), who commuted to her summer internship on Capitol Hill via public transportation, said the increases have made her less likely to ride the Metro.
“I was frustrated over the summer, when I had an unpaid internship, because I was responsible for transportation costs, and the Metro fares really added up, meaning that I was paying to go to work,” she said.
Although she no longer requires the Metro to get to work, Dylewsky indicated that she would hesitate to commute in the future.
“Especially with the increase, I couldn’t afford to commute to work every day if I wasn’t being paid,” she said.
Ana Rodriguez (SFS ’15), who travels weekly to Columbia Heights to teach a course designed to help recent immigrants pass their naturalization exam, echoed this sentiment.
“It’s so annoying, and it’s not good for my budget. I’m only trying to serve the community, and it’s costing me more than I have,” she said. “I really like what I do, so I’ll pay for it, but it’s annoying.”
To offset the increase in fares for paper cards, WMATA has announced plans to continue installing machines that sell SmarTrip cards in stations throughout the network to make them easier to purchase.
Other changes to the Metro system include the elimination of the 20 percent peak-of-the-peak surcharges. Originally instituted to reduce crowding, the surcharge failed because it was not effective in getting riders to alter their commutes.

The men’s soccer team took to the field in gold shoelaces Sunday to raise awareness and funds to combat childhood cancer.
The game was the first time the Hoyas have participated in Lace-Up 4 Pediatric Cancer, a nationwide campaign sponsored by the Go4theGoal Foundation. The organization, which is dedicated to fighting childhood cancer, has donated $270,000 to Jeffrey Toretsky, a researcher in Georgetown’s Lombardi Cancer Center.
Toretsky has successfully targeted a protein that is only present in the cells of Ewing’s sarcoma, a rare cancer that occurs most frequently in teenagers and young adults. Toretsky is on the path to developing a drug with minimal side effects, according to Carol Pribulka, associate director of development at Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center.
“Toretsky’s discovery is really critical for Ewing’s sarcoma,” Pribulka said. “It’s a long road to discover a drug. It’s 20 years from bench to marketplace and [Go4theGoal’s] funding has really helped him along the way.”
All ticket sale proceeds from Sunday’s game were donated to Go4theGoal. In honor of their partnership, the men’s soccer team also visited Toretsky’s lab in August.
Head Coach Brian Wiese said his players were inspired after seeing the lab firsthand.
“It’s eye-opening for the guys to see this was going on within a stone’s throw of where they play,” Wiesesaid. “They were blown away by the dedication, passion and commitment for what these guys do.”
For Beth and Richard Stefanacci, the founders of Go4theGoal, this fundraising and advocacy work has a personal meaning. They founded the organization in 2007 after their son Richard died from Ewing’s sarcoma.
“Our son would’ve been 20 on September 27. He could’ve been any one of these kids,” RichardStefanacci said while watching Georgetown play the University of Pennsylvania Sunday.
Stefanacci said he believes in the power of events like Lace-Up 4 Pediatric Cancer to make a difference in cancer research.
“In the long run, someone wearing laces today goes to med school and goes into pediatric oncology. We’re planting the seeds for years and years from now,” he said.
Go4theGoal also gives to the Children’s Cancer Foundation Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Clinic atMedStar Georgetown University Hospital. During the holiday season, a member of the Go4theGoalboard will visit the clinic and distribute gift bags to the children.
“We’re very lucky and fortunate that the foundation approached us to help our patients,” said Mary Lane, a clinical social worker in pediatric hematology oncology at MedStar. “They produce a lot of holiday joy.”
The football and women’s soccer teams will also participate in Lace-Up 4 Pediatric Cancer later this year. Toretsky said he hopes the swimming and diving team will also find a way to get involved. The researcher said he swims at the same time as swim team practice in the mornings.
“Then they’d swim next to me and say ‘that’s the guy whose research we’re supporting,’” he said.

Though the Georgetown chapter of advocacy group D.C. Students Speak has remained involved in registering students to vote, its presence on campus has receded in the wake of the resolution of the 2010 Campus Plan.
DCSS is a nonpartisan group that seeks to amplify the student voice in the political arena. The group is composed of representatives of seven core universities in the D.C. area, including Georgetown, American University, Howard University, Catholic University of America, Trinity University, the University of the District of Columbia and George Washington University.
This election cycle, a total of eight students are set to run for Advisory Neighborhood Commission seats throughout the District. As a result, DCSS is primarily focused on registering students to vote in D.C., according to Michael Panek, a junior at American University and chairman of their DCSS chapter.
“For the longest time, we haven’t seen much of a college voice,” he said. “One of our main goals is to register students to vote in the District so that our officials have a reason to listen to us the next time a big policy change comes along.”
Scott Stirrett (SFS ’13), former DCSS co-founder and former chairman, has been heavily involved in Georgetown’s voter registration efforts and feels that the organization has been successful in registering students within the District.
“A lot of college students have decided to register locally, and I think that that’s not just because ofDCSS but because of a lot of people who have done a lot of work on this [voter registration push],”Stirrett said.
Two of the eight potential student seats are from Georgetown, marking the first time in 10 years that the university is likely to have a second student commissioner on ANC 2E.
Stirrett said that over 700 people have registered to vote this year using the new software TurboVoteand estimated that around 40 percent had registered in D.C.
DCSS had hoped to increase its presence on campus this semester, but plans to table during the Student Activities Fair fell through. Instead, the group has been relying on alternative methods for spreading awareness.
“Most of our recruitment is either done through our website or through word of mouth,” Trevor Tezel(SFS ’15), chair of Georgetown’s DCSS chapter, said. “We try and reach out through other political clubs on campus to let other students who might be interested in politics know.”
Stirrett acknowledged that the group currently plays a quiet role on campus, as it cannot currently endorse any candidates or parties in the election.
“I think holding more … tangible [and] specific public events is something that’s beneficial to do,” he suggested. “What I think would be really cool is looking towards 2014, which would be the next D.C. mayoral election.”
DCSS has maintained a close relationship with the Georgetown University College Democrats, cosponsoring speaker events such as one featuring D.C. Councilmember Tommy Wells last year.
Though the group’s partnerships with the Georgetown University Student Association and GUCD have been effective in increasing voter registration, DCSS has little in the way of plans after the election.
Tezel said that the group is still trying to bring Councilmember Jack Evans to campus to speak, after the event scheduled for last year was cancelled.
“We’re hoping that soon we will hear from him so he’ll come to Georgetown University and field some of our concerns,” Tezel said.
“[Evans’] office has not responded to previous overtures of ours to discuss issues like town-gown relations and the noise ordinance,” Tezel wrote in an email. “We’re hoping that his view will change because Georgetown University represents a sizable constituency in his district.”
Stirrett also suggested a mayoral forum that would allow different candidates to explain their views and answer questions.
“It’ll be … interesting going forward. I can picture it being quieter now that the campus plan is resolved,” Stirrett said. “New issues always come up, and I think we’ll shift a little bit, since that was something we focused on since the beginning.”

The Office of International Programs is closely monitoring its study abroad programs across the globe in response to the wave of violent anti-American protests that have spread throughout much of the Muslim world.
Thus far, no Georgetown students studying abroad have been endangered, nor have any overseas academic programs been disrupted, according to Executive Director of International Programs Katherine Bellows.
“All of our programs are operating normally and … [OIP] will continue to monitor the global situation closely,” she said.
An email sent Sunday evening to students studying abroad by Lisa Gordinier, interim director of OIP’sDivision of Overseas Studies, urged students to avoid protests and comply with instructions from local police.
The region has been a tumultuous one for study abroad programs in recent years. All 15 students studying at the American University in Cairo in spring 2011 were evacuated to Doha following the escalation of protests against the regime of former President Hosni Mubarak. Last fall, Derrik Sweeney (COL ’13) was arrested while studying abroad in Cairo for allegedly participating in violent protests inTahrir Square.
Since this month’s protests have mostly targeted American consulates and embassies, the email also advised students against travelling with large groups of Americans and frequenting American establishments.
Samantha Lin (SFS ’14), who is studying in Amman, Jordan, this semester, said that although the city has not been immune to protests, she does not feel like her security has been threatened.
“I feel very safe here in Jordan. There are several layers of protection surrounding the students here,” she said.
Lin said the combination of a supportive host family and a constant stream of updates from the American embassy and the Council on International Educational Exchange, which operates the program in Amman, has ensured her safety.
“My host mom and four host siblings … are very protective of me,” she said. “In the evenings they watch the news and then relay it to me since my Arabic skills are not up to that standard yet. We talk about the situation, and they truly watch over me on my commute to school and to other activities.”
Barbara Gallets (COL ’14), who is also studying in Amman, agreed.
“Honestly, I do not feel that my safety has been put into jeopardy because of the unrest over recent events,” she said. “Nothing has been disrupted; classes have gone on as normal.”
Lin and Gallets both said that they have taken precautions to avoid areas of the city that are particularly rife with protests.
“We are told to stay away from downtown Amman after the Friday prayers because weekly demonstrations follow,” Gallets said. “But we haven’t had any other restrictions or disruptions here.”

In the wake of a two-year-long unionization effort and a series of broad dining changes this summer, workers atO’Donovan Hall are dissatisfied with their relationship to their employer, ARAMARK Higher Education.
Employees say that ARAMARK has changed shifts and reassigned duties within the dining hall in order to minimize the number of workers to whom it must pay full-time salaries and benefits. At the same time, the number of students served at Leo’s has increased this year.
Georgetown first contracted ARAMARK in 2007, and the contract was renewed in 2012 for another five-year period, according to Margie Bryant, associate vice president for auxiliary services. In addition to Leo’s, ARAMARK provides food services for Grab ’n’ Go, Wolfington Hall, Cosi, Starbucks and the Pre-Clinical Science Building’s Dr. Mug.
Last September, workers at these locations joined a local chapter of UNITE HERE, a national labor union that includes workers in the hotel, airport, food service, laundry and gaming industries. Once unionized, Georgetown dining employees worked to secure an improved contract with ARAMARK, winning them higher wages and expanded health care coverage. The contract was signed in February.
“Our employees at Georgetown are represented by a local union who negotiated a collective bargaining agreement on their behalf,” ARAMARK Director of Communications Karen Cutler said. “We have a good working relationship with the union and adhere to the terms and conditions of that collective bargaining agreement.”
But five months after the contract was signed, Leo’s workers say they are unhappy with the treatment they have received from ARAMARK.
“A lot of us have been here for a long time, and they don’t ask us our opinions on anything. They just change it,” said a female employee who has worked at the dining hall for 19 years, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “We know what the students like. … We talk to the students. Why not talk to us? … They didn’t do that. They just changed it, wiped it out.”
Shift changes enacted over the summer as part of the restructuring of services in the dining hall have also been unpopular among employees, forcing some of them to rearrange their family and work schedules.
“A lot of people have second jobs, and they already had their days set. Now, people have to adjust their lives and tell the second job that they can’t work this day or have to come in later,” the female employee said. “And we thought that was messed up, because it wasn’t broken, so why did [ARAMARK] try to fix it?”
A male employee who has worked at Leo’s for 15 years, also speaking anonymously, said that many of the changes instituted this semester — including the elimination of the wrap and make-your-own-pizza stations as well as the removal of options at the pasta and stir-fry stations — were designed to minimize the number of workers needed to run the cafeteria at any given time.
“[ARAMARK] said they got a 74 percent increase of students on meal plans, and that’s why they needed more people on weekends and evening shifts. But the thing is, there are less people on weekends and on the evening shifts,” he said.
Cutler said that Leo’s is not understaffed.
“All locations are fully staffed to ensure quality service,” she wrote in an email.
The male employee, however, said he gets off his shift late because Leo’s is shorthanded.
“This year was the only year that I know, in recent memory, where we didn’t see new employees come in,” he said. “They still have the same amount of people they had last year. They just have more work to do.”
According to Bryant, the changes in food selection and service were a result of student surveys conducted in the spring of 2012, and the “We Hear You” campaign was created to communicate the alterations.
But the employee said that students are unhappy because they did not ask for the first set of changes.
“The thing is [that] they can’t really tell you why they took it. The stuff that they added, they said, was for the students. … [But] the students, the ones we talked to, said they never asked for this,” he said. “That’s why you don’t see a lot of students happy with the changes.”
When the dining committee — a group composed of students, university administrators and ARAMARK representatives — received further feedback, a second campaign, “We Hear You 2.0,” reinstituted some options, including the taco bar, a renewed variety of vegetables at the pasta station and a weekends-only make-your-own-pizza station.
However, according to the male employee, the changes at Leo’s have had a negative overall impact on the dining experience.
“Now, three weeks into the school year, it is worse,” he said.
The female employee said that changes to Grab ’n’ Go have placed a greater burden on workers at those facilities.
“They have less food, so it’s less work for the stocking person. He doesn’t have a whole lot to do like he had before, so that means they can pull him to do something else,” she said. “Then it’s like one person on two or three jobs. They are being tricky about it.”
The male employee said that ARAMARK is taking advantage of its workers.
“People just don’t see any way out. In this day, the economy is real bad, so it’s not like we can say we are going to leave and go to something better. … The company knows this, so they’ve backed people into a corner,” he said.
Members of the Georgetown Solidarity Committee, which helped workers form their union last year, say that these changes take a toll on both employees and students.
“There are two components to [the changes], one being that students are affected by this. We have fewer options, fewer healthy options,” GSC member Erin Riordan (COL ’15) said. “There is also the worker’s side to it, where by cutting certain stations, they end up cutting certain positions and giving people fewer hours and things like that.”
According to Bryant, Leo’s workers’ contract with ARAMARK provides them with a mechanism for addressing concerns.
“The union has a formal grievance procedure for resolving all issues between ARAMARK management and workers. When a grievance procedure cannot produce a satisfactory outcome, an arbitrator is used to settle the disagreement,” she wrote in an email. “To date, all issues have been settled through the grievance procedure, with no need for an arbitrator.”
The union negotiation that occurred last year also included a collective bargaining agreement between ARAMARK and Georgetown employees to facilitate the communication of grievances.
“While ARAMARK is contractually required to comply with the just employment policies of Georgetown University, it is responsible for its own labor relations with its employees and any trade union represented among its employees,” Bryant wrote in an email. “The collective bargaining agreement between ARAMARK and its employees provides structure and framework for the operation and interaction of workers and management.”
Despite the agreement, workers still feel challenged.
“We have to fight them on everything,” the female employee said. “I guess … since we signed our contract, that they just wanted to show everybody that they still have power, with the work shifts and the shifting of the days.”
According to Riordan, there is an alignment between students’ and workers’ interests on these issues.
“One thing that stood out to us was that the complaints from workers and students were very similar, and it was generally about the amount of food that was being offered and how it was being offered,” she said.
ARAMARK, which earned over $13 billion in revenue in 2011 and is ranked as the United States’ 204th largest company on CNN’s Fortune 500 list, has a mixed record on workers’ rights issues. In April 2010, the company signed an agreement with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers that raised wages for tomato pickers by more than 70 percent, but ARAMARK has also come under fire from some of its customers in the education community.
In 2008, Yale University chose not to renew its contract with the company in the wake of concerns about budgeting and the treatment of workers. Yale Daily News reported in 2001 that ARAMARK posted a $3 million budget deficit during its first year of operation at the school while increasing costs to the university and students. Bob Pronto, the president of the local union that represented Yale dining workers, told YDN that the company also frequently shuffled employees between Yale dining halls and changed managers, similarly to the conditions Leo’s employees described.
“It seemed as though they were more worried about achieving a bottom line as it related to their profit,” Pronto told YDN in 2008. “[ARAMARK] tried at different turns to undermine the quality of food. They cut very close the quantity of food that they ordered and caused us to have certain shortages.”
Georgetown’s contract with ARAMARK runs until 2017, but GSC members say that students have a role to play in lobbying the company for better treatment of workers.
“We want to bring these issues to campus attention,” GSC member Julia Hubbell (COL ’15) said.

With a record 61 graduates from the Class of 2012 flocking to join Teach For America, Georgetown produced the third-highest number of new recruits from among medium-sized universities this year.
This is the third time in four years that Georgetown has placed third among medium-sized universities, which the organization defines as those with between 3,000 and 9,999 undergraduates.
According to Mike Schaub, executive director of the Cawley Career Education Center at Georgetown, Teach For America is an attractive option for many graduates because it combines community service with opportunities for skill development for later careers.
“Many Georgetown students are dedicated to volunteering and service activities, and they want to find a way to continue serving others after graduation,” Schaub said. “Teach For America is one organization in which graduates can help others while obtaining valuable skills and experiences that will be beneficial to their careers.”
More than 470 Georgetown graduates have volunteered for the organization for two-year terms after graduation, and the number has grown each year, despite an increasingly competitive applicant pool. Only about 12 percent of the 48,000 applicants for the 2012 teaching cycle were hired, hailing from over 600 colleges across the country.
Deven Comen (COL ’12) joined the program after graduating last May and started teaching ninth-grade English at Anacostia Senior High School in southeast Washington, D.C., earlier this month. Comencharacterized the experience as a natural progression from her undergraduate studies.
“Joining Teach For America was kind of like the culmination of … my time at Georgetown, [which was] deeply influenced by Jesuit values of social justice,” Comen said. “Going to school at Georgetown, [I was] surrounded by people so committed to their passions and to helping others.”
Comen, who developed an interest in education throughout her college years teaching abroad in India and Thailand, as well as in D.C. schools through One World Youth Project, added that the experience affords a unique opportunity for leadership not found in most post-graduation pursuits.
“Right out of college, I’m leading a group of students. … All the flexibility I have in determining what I teach and how to teach is different from any other post-graduate career,” she said. “While my friends are in cubicles doing busy work, I feel like I’m really making a difference.”

Georgetown University’s former Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Philip Boroughs, S.J., was inaugurated as the 32nd president of the College of the Holy Cross Sept. 14.
Both Boroughs and Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia, who traveled to Worcester, Mass., Friday to speak at Boroughs’ inauguration ceremony, stressed the importance of establishing a sense of community within and among Jesuit universities.
“Something is realized, something happens when we come together in a place, shaped by a shared common purpose, a common vision of what brings us together,” DeGioia said. “The vision of a Catholic and Jesuit college is one where we come together.”
DeGioia also expressed confidence in Boroughs’ leadership ability.
“[Boroughs is] a large-souled man who has lived his vocation with integrity and fidelity, a selfless man who will bring out the best in you, the best in this community,” he said.
In his presidential address, Boroughs echoed DeGioia’s remarks about the importance of reviving the Jesuit ideals in the college community. He said Holy Cross’ Jesuit value of contemplation will provide a mechanism for dealing with contemporary issues.
“As a community of educators, we have an opportunity to define in our time what contemplation in action means at Holy Cross. We can choose to be reflective. … In these challenging times, we can choose to act with such integrity and ingenuity in making difficult decisions that others see in us ways of linking prayer, reflectivity and [can] discern choices that inspire and energize,” Boroughs said.
Boroughs served an eight-year tenure as Georgetown’s first vice president for mission and ministry — from 2003 to 2011 — and was the only Jesuit serving as a senior university administrator.
While at Georgetown, Boroughs also helped raise funds to develop the Calcagnini Contemplative Center, a religious retreat center that is currently under construction, to renovate the historic DahlgrenChapel and to endow positions and programs within the Office of Mission and Ministry.
Boroughs introduced the Ignatius Seminar, the Kenya Immersion Program and Jesuit Heritage Week, among other initiatives that served to emphasize the importance of social justice and community involvement on campus.
