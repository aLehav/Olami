Joanna Foote (SFS ’13) was awarded the Harry S. Truman Scholarship for the state of Colorado Friday.
“For me now to have $30,000 for grad school is very humbling,” Foote said. “I am very excited, but it doesn’t make me forget the realities of the world.”
Foote took a leave of absence last fall to spend the semester on the U.S.-Mexico border, working with young adults who had dropped out of school to help support their families.
With the scholarship, Foote plans to attend graduate school to study social anthropology and geography in order to research immigration. She hopes to use her graduate degree to advocate for immigrant rights.
“Ultimately, when you win the scholarship it becomes about yourself, but it’s not like that for me,” Foote said. “It’s more about these immigrant communities that I’ve served and the people I care about, and this is my chance to help them.”
The Truman Scholarship Foundation received 587 applications this year and chose the 60 winners from a pool of 191 finalists after an extensive interview and application process.
This year, Foote was one of two Georgetown students to be named finalists for the award, which provides students who demonstrate strong records in public service with $30,000 toward graduate studies. The university has produced a total of 26 Truman Scholars, with the last recipient before Foote, Sebastian Johnson (COL ’10), winning in 2009.

Hoya Ideas Community, an online platform that allows students to submit, comment on and vote for suggestions to the university, has accumulated about 50 ideas and more than individual 700 users since its launch a month ago.
The website aims to facilitate more efficient communication among students, clubs and the university administration.
“We want to make sure [the platform] is something integrated in students’ daily life,” James Li (MSB’13), a student liaison for the platform, said. “We want it to become part of how you would go about solving an issue at Georgetown.”
Georgetown University Student Association’s former Secretary of Information and Technology Michael Crouch (MSB ’13), who helped design the site, said the university responded swiftly after students rallied around a post asking for action when the university announced that LXR and Nevils Halls would lack air conditioning until May.
“When the [air conditioning] problem arose, it seemed like a very opportune moment to test [Hoya Ideas Community] to see if it would work,” he said.
Crouch’s request that university housing provide fans or repair the air conditioning system before May solicited 121 student votes of support. The university announced that it would install a temporary chiller one day after the post to Hoya Ideas Community, a success that Crouch also attributes to student emails and an open letter sent to the Chief Operating Officer and the Office of Student Housing.
Chief Innovation Officer Michael Wang (MSB ’07) said the platform has served as a helpful channel togauge student needs. According to Wang, university leaders regularly review the website and discuss popular ideas during administrative meetings.
A recent post about campus WiFi caught the attention of Chief Information Officer Lisa Davis, Wang said. He added that the university is working to implement short-term solutions to address the issue.
Currently, ideas labeled “In Review” by the university include more freedom for meal swipes atO’Donovan Dining Hall and GPS trackers for SafeRides vans. Projects in this section are in the process of being investigated or implemented, according to Wang.
GUSA representatives said the platform will allow them to better represent and engage with students.
“The senate is here as a resource, but ultimately we’re only talking to people we know, just like everyone else,” GUSA Senate Speaker Adam Talbot (COL ’12) said. “It’s definitely going to be a place in the future for the senate to look for issues important to students.”
Li, however, noted more feedback on the platform should be gathered before the website, which is currently in beta mode, officially launches at the Georgetown Innovation Summit on April 19 and 20.
Adam Ramadam (SFS ’14), a member of a focus group organized by Li Tuesday, agreed that the visible connection between students and administrators on the site should be expanded.
“Right now, everyone can post anything they want without prior screening, but one of the questions is how do we go ahead and get concerns and relay them to the university administration,” he said.
The developers are considering adding features such as email responses, press releases or a blog that the administration could use to address the feasibility of certain ideas.
“It’s a good step to have the platform, but to actually get the university to respond, that’s going to be the key to making the platform last years and years,” Li said.
Correction: The article originally said that Adam Ramadam was a member of the Class of 2012. He is a member of the Class of 2014.

Participants in several Alternative Spring Break trips and the Magis Immersion and Justice Program sponsored a week of events to share their experiences learning about the lives of immigrants and migrant workers.
The “Nothing Human is Alien to Me” project, which began Monday, aimed to address ideas about home, migration, unequal power structures and human dignity.
“What this week was hoping to convey [was] the human reality, the living experience, of people who go through this in their daily lives,” Thomas Scharff (COL ’12), co-leader of the Immokalee Migrant Worker Justice trip, said.
The Border Awareness Experience, Kino Border Immersion, Immokalee Migrant Worker Justice and MagisEl Salvador spring break trips focused on problems surrounding social justice in immigration law and the working conditions of migrant day laborers.
“All of the trips working on this project truly believe in the title we chose for the week, ‘Nothing Human Is Alien to Me,’ and wanted to raise awareness about these issues on campus and catalyze action to make sure that everyone is treated as a human being,” co-leader of the Border Awareness Experience trip Carly Rosenfield (COL ’14) said.
Last year, the trips held individual follow-up events, but this year, the group coordinators collaborated to organize the week. Events ranged from discussions of participants’ personal experiences and evaluations of the trips to reflections on the stories of individual immigrants and migrant workers.
“Migrants and refugees are our brothers and sisters. They deserve our help, and they have something to teach us,” Vice President of Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., who went on the Kino Border Immersion trip, said.

On-campus crime hit its low for this academic year, as crime plummeted 41 percent between February and March.
The Department of Public Safety reported 37 incidents this month, compared to 58 incidents in February.
The overall crime decrease was due to a decline in the number of thefts. DPS reported 12 thefts this month, compared with 26 in February.
While thefts declined, burglaries made up a greater share of the total crime. DPS reported seven burglaries this month, compared to two in February and one in March of last year.
The Metropolitan Police Department is handling two burglaries that occurred on March 4 and 5 in the New Research Building and Building D in the Medical Center. Both incidents remain unresolved.
However, perpetrators of a March 18 burglary at St. Mary’s Hall were detained and arrested by DPSand MPD after a late-night chase in Burleith.
A March 12 burglary in White-Gravenor Hall is also being handled by MPD and no suspects have been apprehended.
The number of assaults fell to two incidents, a decrease from February, during which three assaults and one sexual assault were reported.
Drug and alcohol violations remained consistent with previous months, with four and three incidents respectively. All violations were referred to the Office of Student Conduct.

Allen St. Pierre, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, advocated for the legalization of marijuana in the District and across the country Thursday evening.
In 2010, the D.C. City Council approved a medical marijuana legalization initiative originally voted on in 1998. The District’s first store specifically catering to those who want to grow marijuana, weGrow, is slated to open Friday.
However, St. Pierre said he believes it will be another year before citizens have the ability to legally purchase medical marijuana at District dispensaries, though he is used to setbacks in legislation.
“You need to develop a marathoner’s muscle, not a sprinter’s muscle,” he said in his talk organized by the Lecture Fund.
St. Pierre described American criminalization of marijuana as contradictory and dangerous, noting that punishments for the possession of drugs range from fines to criminal prosecution across the United States.
“You will be arrested, which is a violent interaction between you and your government. … Who is the victim? Who is the government representing in this interaction, since nobody’s being beaten, no property’s being stolen, nobody’s being harmed?” St. Pierre said.
Although legalization of marijuana is on the ballot in seven states, St. Pierre anticipates that only Colorado and Washington are viable candidates for legalization because they are the only two states with heavily funded campaigns.
St. Pierre equated the fight for marijuana law reform to Prohibition-era politics, as some of the people most vehemently opposed to legalization of marijuana are those who profit most from the illegal drug trade. He noted that a significant portion of the opposition to Proposition 19, which would have legalized marijuana in California, came from the “Emerald Triangle,” a region known for growing cannabis.
According to St. Pierre, one bright spot for marijuana law reform is the growing support for legalization nationwide. According to a poll published by Gallup in October, 50 percent of Americans supported legalization, while 46 percent were against it. St. Pierre hopes that this level of support will eventually spur the federal government to act.
“What idiot cannot look at [the majority] of people supporting something across all strata and not, in a democracy, know that that’s where you need to go?” he said.

Popular M Street creperie and espresso bar Crêpe Amour and its partner restaurant Georgetown Wing Co. are scheduled to close their doors this Sunday.
Co-owner Sri Suku said that the company decided to leave the Georgetown location, opened just over two years ago, after its landlord raised the rent for the upcoming lease renewal in May.
“[The rent] more than doubled, making it uneconomical to be here,” Suku said. “There’s a certain factor when you have to know when to walk away.”
Suku said that Good Stuff Eatery, a Capitol Hill restaurant that specializes in burgers, milkshakes and salads, will be the new occupant of the space. According to Good Stuff Eatery’s website, the restaurant will open a branch in Georgetown this spring.
Representatives could not be reached to confirm that the branch would be located in the spot vacated by Crêpe Amour.
Meanwhile, Crêpe Amour plans to open a new location in Vienna, Va., later this spring, according toSuku. In addition, the company plans to start a food truck and catering service, both operating under the name “Crêpe Love.”
The food truck will serve various locations throughout the District as well as Arlington, Fairfax, Clarendon, Tyson’s Corner and Rosslyn, Va. The owners hope to have the truck up and running in two to three weeks.
Suku added that Crêpe Amour is likely to open a new location in Georgetown and is also searching for a site in downtown D.C.
“We’re continuing to look for a location in Georgetown. As we speak, it’s not 100 percent, but if we get a good space, we’ll obviously take it,” he said. “Nothing is concrete yet. … You’ll see us popping up.”
Suku said he is grateful for the support of the surrounding neighborhood, and Georgetown students in particular, throughout Crêpe Amour’s time in the area.
“We have done phenomenally well, especially with the support of students and the community,” Sukusaid. “There’s a great synergy that we’ve had from more than a financial perspective. It’s really been a business for the community, by the community.”

When Agnes Neill Williams (LAW ’54) stepped onto the Georgetown Law Center campus for the first time, she broke 81 years of tradition.
In 1951, Williams became part of the first class of women to enroll at the law school.
“That was the beginning,” she said. “It was a little bit intimidating, [but] it was exciting to be a pioneer.”
Since it opened in 1870, the Law Center’s student body had consisted exclusively of men.
“The school’s administrators expressly asserted that the law was a male profession with a bylaw closing the school to women,” the law center wrote in its self-history, “The First 125 Years: An Illustrated History of the Georgetown University Law Center.”
Though by 1950 many area schools had opened their doors to women — The George Washington University did so in 1913 — and women were slowly being admitted to Georgetown’s graduate programs, the idea of a coed law school was unthinkable to administrators.
But in 1950, the university quietly announced the decision to admit women in an official bulletin released in the Georgetown Law School annual catalog.
“In view of the success women have achieved in many professional fields including law, Georgetown Law School has decided to break with tradition and accept women applicants,” the bulletin read.
The decision sparked a backlash. Joe Gaghan, a professor at the time, was among the strongest opponents to the new policy.
“I remember when the question came up, Dean [Hugh] Fegan and I rode a white charger up and down the corridors demanding that we retain the school as the last stronghold of masculinity,” he told professor Wendy Williams, author of a feature entitled “A History of Women at Georgetown University Law Center” that appeared in the fall 2001 edition of Georgetown Law’s alumni magazine.
According to Georgetown historian Fr. Emmett Curran, S.J., the opposition stemmed from a small but vocal minority.
“I think it was just … prejudice against women. They didn’t consider them part of the traditional Jesuit mission,” he said.
In the summer of 1951, Patricia Anna Collier became the first woman to enroll in a Law Center class. She was joined that September by Williams and six others.
In those first years, not all faculty members were convinced that women belonged at the law school.
Sherman Cohn (LAW ’57), now a professor at the law school, was a student at Georgetown Law when women were still a small minority at the school.
“There were a few [professors] who acted very badly,” Cohn wrote in an email. “My impression is that one, perhaps two, delighted in telling very raunchy jokes when he had a woman in the class. Another, a Jesuit, who was a very tough classroom teacher … seemed to be even harder when he called on one of the few women in the class.”
But after a few years, even Gaghan, who had sharply criticized the decision to admit women, acknowledged their contribution.
“We have had some terrific girl students here … and I’m the first to admit that I was just about as wrong as anyone could be wrong,” he told Wendy Williams.
Agnes Williams, then Agnes Neill, worked exceptionally hard in her classes and won the Beaudry Moot Court Competition in 1952.
“One of the professors … told me that he just wanted me to know that he had been one of the leading opponents of women at the law school … and that he had changed his mind,” Williams said. “And I was impressed that he was willing to say that.”
Though the atmosphere gradually grew more accepting, Williams said that the small band of female students sometimes struggled to fit in.
“The male students were friendly, but … I missed the companionship of other women,” Williams said. “I don’t think there was the camaraderie you’d expect, because we weren’t the same age. Once we had more numbers, we had more camaraderie.”
Williams found work at a law firm after graduation, but not all female graduates were able to obtain full-time jobs in their field. Williams added that she faced discrimination on the job.
“When I was practicing law, I felt that clients did not want a woman lawyer,” she said.
Cohn, who took a spot on the hiring committee for the Law Center in 1968, said building the legacy of women in law took time.
“With very few women in law school, there were very few applicants for teaching jobs, and then a school had to find a person they concluded were qualified,” he wrote.
During the 1970s, women began more aggressively organizing under the banner of the Women’s Rights Collective, a Georgetown group that pushed for larger numbers of female professors and students.
“When I joined the faculty in 1972 there were not many women law professors anywhere in the nation. Some of the male students were skeptical … [but] women were very supportive … in part because they were still dealing themselves with the challenge of entering a male dominated profession,” law professor Judith Areen wrote in an email.
Areen later became the first female dean of the Law School, in 1989.
“Groups like the Women’s Rights Collective also … pressured the faculty to add more women,” she said. “The numbers kept growing.”
This shift is reflected in the school’s student body as well. In the 1950s, women made up between 1 and 2 percent of the law school’s student body; by 2010, women comprised 50 percent of the incoming class, according to Law School admissions statistics.
Curran said that despite Georgetown’s delayed start to hiring women professors in significant numbers and increasing female student enrollment, the university has done well in its first half-century of integration.
“Even though it’s a short history of women at the law school, it’s a strong one,” he said.

The Article JUSTICE FOR ALL:GU LAW’S FIRST WOMEN dated 3/30/2012 was correct, but left the details of my being the first woman from Georgetown Law “to complete the entire Bachelor of Laws (LL.B) program at Georgetown Law.”  My degree was conferred on October 1, 1953.  The quote is from a letter written on September 8, 2009 by Matthew F. Calise, Director, Office of Alumni Affairs.
Another quote, “I can assure you that you have the distinction of being the first woman graduate to have completed the entire full-time LLB. curriculum at Georgetown Law.  This is an achievement for which you should be proud.  To paraphrase our President–you are a true daughter of Georgetown forever.”  He also enclosed an official “Certification of Graduation.” 
It should be noted there was a transfer student, Ruth Pavan, who graduated 3 months before me.
However, she did not complete all her coursework at Georgetown.
As an aside, I believe I was the first woman from Georgetown to be personally sworn in as a member of the United States Supreme Court.  I was sponsored by Dean Paul Dean, who attended the ceremony, along with my husband in 1966, Justice Earl Warren, presiding.
It should be noted that I am now 91 years old and still practicing law, on a limited basis, in California.  
Sincerely,
RENEE GROSSHANDLER BAUM

Six months after the debut of the university’s landlord pledge — an agreement that calls on landlords to abide by D.C. regulations — some city officials are questioning its impact.
Since the initiative was announced last October, 36 landlords representing 93 properties have signed the pledge.
According to Helder Gil, a spokesperson for the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, more than 1,250 rental properties are registered in the 20007 zip code, which includes the neighborhoods of Georgetown, Burleith and Foxhall Village. He estimated that at least 100propertiesare currently being rented without proper licensing in the area.
Currently, 1,250 undergraduates and 327 graduate students rent properties in West Georgetown andBurleith, according to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh.
Gil said the pledge is a good opportunity to increase students’ awareness of their rights as renters, but it has not had a significant impact on the numbers of unlicensed properties rented in Georgetown.
“I think the folks that are renting … properties that don’t meet code are not likely to be signing the pledge,” he said. “These are the ones that I think both [the DCRA] and the university are concernedabout.”
Bill Starrels, an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner who has advocated for greater landlord accountability since a fire in a rental house killed Daniel Rigby (MSB ’05) in 2004, questioned whether the pledge has had its intended effect.
“The landlords haven’t changed; the management companies haven’t changed [since the pledge was created],” he said. “Things are close to the status quo, I’ve been hearing.”
Landlord Dori Konopka, one of the signatories, said that the pledge has potential, but students and landlords need to take it seriously.
“It’s a good policy, and if everyone followed it, [the pledge] would work really well. Unfortunately, there are students who don’t pay attention, and there are landlords who don’t pay attention,” she said.
According to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr, the pledge is a part of wider efforts to make students more aware of their rights as tenants. On April 13, the university will bring a program support specialist from D.C.’s Office of the Tenant Advocate to campus to answer students’ questions about renting.
Gil said that these efforts are crucial to ensuring that student tenants are protected.
“The university is really stepping up its advocacy for its off-campus students so that they [can live] in safe and legal housing conditions. [It is] a great thing for the university to be highlighting the fact that its students … have basic housing rights to safe and legal housing conditions,” he said.
Landlord David Solovey, who rents his property in Burleith to students and has also signed onto the pledge, said that the issue is a joint concern for landlords and tenants.
“I’ve been a landlord [in Georgetown] for 48 years. Anything that is involved with the school and the community, I’m interested in,” he said.

Republican presidential candidate and former Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich stressed his desire to return the country to its religious values and reform Social Security Wednesday.
Gingrich’s talk in Gaston Hall sparked a protest on Copley Lawn that drew about 20 students chanting and holding signs.
At the lecture, Gingrich introduced a proposal to partially privatize Social Security. Under his plan, taxpayers would manage a private savings account with funds drawn from their paychecks. Contributions from employers would continue to fund the Social Security trust.
“It turns out, according to the official actuary for social security, if we had adopted in 1983 a personal social security savings account model, we would today have over $16 trillion in savings accounts,” Gingrich said.
Opponents of Gingrich’s plan argue that the 2008 financial crisis would have destroyed private Social Security accounts, had his plan already been implemented. Gingrich, however, defended his plan.
“If you look at what happened to the stock market in 2008 and 2009, a person, even after the decline of the stock market, would have dramatically more money than they would have gotten out of the traditional system,” he said.
Before the lecture, about 20 people chanted phrases holding signs reading “The 1%” and criticizing Gingrich’s desire for less campaign finance restriction. The protesters initially stationed themselves on the sidewalk adjacent to Healy Circle, but were asked to move to Copley Lawn in accordance with university rules.
“We want Newt to keep his hands off our Social Security,” protest attendee Cole Stangler (SFS ’13) said.
Other protesters criticized Gingrich for his views on social issues and his recent comments about the killing of Trayvon Martin.
“We support civil discourse and understand its importance, but there is nothing civil about Newt’s anti-immigrant, anti-gay, anti-equality speech. Excluding the 99 percent since 1979 is most uncivil,” English professor and protest attendee Jennifer Fink said.
In his lecture, Gingrich asserted that the American work ethic stemmed from deep-seated religious values.
“We’re the only society where power comes from God to each one of you personally,” Gingrich said. “You are personally sovereign. You loan power to the state. The state does not loan power toyou.”
In an interview with campus media, Gingrich expressed discontent with the Obama administration’s mandate requiring universities and hospitals, including those with religious affiliations, to provide contraceptive coverage in their employees’ and students’ health care plans.
“I don’t understand why [anyone] would suggest that religious universities should be forced by a civil government to violate their religious beliefs,” he said. “It’s pretty simple: are we a country founded on religious liberty or not? If we are, then who is the government to define that liberty?” he told The Hoya.
In light of recent cuts to his campaign staff, Gingrich also emphasized that he intends to continue his bid for the Republican nomination.
“We streamlined the campaign precisely to be able to continue to [the GOP convention in] Tampa.  There’s a big difference between streamlining and suspending,” Gingrich told The Hoya. “I think [presidential candidate Mitt] Romney clearly has not yet gotten a majority, nobody thinks he has gotten a majority, so why would I quit?”
