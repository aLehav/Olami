Participants at Crime Prevention Summits on Tuesday and Wednesday got tips on keeping their property safe and some started taking action by registering their bikes and laptops.
The Southwest Quad Community Council worked with the Department of Public Safety to host the events, which took place in the lobbies of Reynolds Hall and McCarthy Hall. Student presenters as well as newly appointed DPS Crime Prevention Coordinator Talib Abdur-Rahim informed students of recent laptop thefts and provided tips on ways to keep safe on campus.
Students also had the chance to register their bikes and laptops with a national registry, StopTheft, which matches recovered items with owners who register their belongings through the service.
Lili Bayer (SFS ’13) said that recent events on campus encouraged her to register her laptop.
“My roommate convinced me to do it, because, obviously, we’ve heard about a lot of crime on campus,” Bayer, said. “One of our good friends had her laptop stolen recently in [Lauinger Library]. Obviously, that really affected her. So we wanted to take good care of our computers and prevent something like that from happening.”
The summits come during a year marked by a series of burglaries and thefts on campus and in the surrounding area.
According to DPS crime logs, 54 thefts and two burglaries have taken place so far in 2011 — nine of which involved unsecured laptops.
Heather Nelson (NHS ’13), who helped organize the event, explained that as the year comes to a close, students should be more vigilant than usual.
“During move-out, people often leave their doors open,” she said, “and it’s important for people to know that you should lock your doors if you want to protect your belongings.”
The summit’s organizers also handed out information on ways to address other safety issues, such as securing windows and travelling in groups at night to avoid the risk of a mugging or sexual assault.
As a sweet perk for students who attended the summit, members of the council gave out free cupcakes.
Dalvin Butler (COL ’13), a member of the Southwest Quad Community Council and another of the summit’s organizers, said that ultimately, students themselves could do the most to ensure their security.
“We hope that residence halls will be safe,” he said, “and we hope that we can provide the right information for students to keep them safe.”

Each of the District’s eight wards will be redrawn by Dec. 31 based on recently released census data.
Discussion about the redistricting and plans for shifting ward borders has already begun.
Between the 2000 and 2010 censuses, D.C.’s Ward 2, which is home to Georgetown as well as The George Washington University and Dupont Circle, experienced the greatest population spike in the District, gaining 11,046 people according to data recorded from the 2010 census. Washington, D.C. as a whole gained 29,664 people, marking a 5.2 percent population increase.
According to the website of the U.S. Census Bureau, census data are used specifically for redefining state legislative districts.
Kevin Stogner, a member of Ward 2 D.C. Councilmember Jack Evans’ staff, said that as of now there are many ways in which the redistricting could occur.
“Right now, there are dozens and dozens of scenarios. The only real rule is that boundaries have to be contiguous with themselves along with being no more than 5 percent above or below the median numbers,” Stogner said.
The D.C. Office of Zoning specifies that each ward should contain the same number of residents. Redistricting of each ward will follow due to changes in the population’s distribution demonstrated by the 2010 census. According to Stogner, Ward 2 will need to shrink while Ward 7, the easternmost part of the city, and Ward 8 in the southeast, must expand.
D.C. Council Chairman Kwame Brown announced that Evans and at-large Councilmember Michael Brown will co-chair the committee charged with redrawing ward boundaries, according to the Washington Examiner.
Formal hearings about redistricting will be held at least once during the day and once in the evening during the week of April 21, Stogner said. The purpose of these is to allow the public to contribute to the redistricting process.
“At this point the goal is to see what the positions are and get public input. We’ll start making decisions after we see what the options are,” Stogner said.
Stogner declined to comment on the reason for Ward 2’s growth in population, but Evans told The GW Hatchet that he wasn’t surprised about the ward’s population jump due to the rising popularity of the Dupont, Chinatown and Logan Circle areas.
Ward boundaries must be redrawn by July 14, according to the Hatchet. After that, the committee will begin working on altering the areas of the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, single member districts and voting precincts, and the whole process must be finished by Dec. 31, according to The Hatchet.

Former D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty emphasized the importance of reforming public education in the nation’s capital regardless of the political consequences in Lohrfink Auditorium on Tuesday.
In his speech —  sponsored by the Lecture Fund, College Democrats and NAACP —  Fenty addressed the steps he had taken in his time as mayor.
After assuming office in 2006, Fenty immediately set out to make education reform a hallmark of his administration, eliminating the public school boards, placing the D.C.’s public education system directly under mayoral control and appointing Michelle Rhee as chancellor and his partner in reform.
“School reform is a campaign to knock down any obstacle that impedes the opportunity for every child to get an education,” Fenty said.
When he entered office, the Washington, D.C.,school system was among the worst in the country. The average student scored between 30 and 70 percent below the national average in both reading and writing at the time.
Fenty sought to undermine the assumption that a school’s performance is based on the socioeconomic background of its student body.
“It is not the kids they bring in, but what they do with them when they are there,” he said.
He cited Banneker Senior High School, located in a part of the District that traditionally presented dismal education statistics, as a counterexample. Banneker now graduates nearly 100 percent of its students in a geographic area where the average graduation rate is less than 50 percent. The school also sends the majority of its students to college.
Fenty attributed the struggles in the classroom to a lack of autonomy that restricts teachers’ freedom to experiment with alternative teaching methods and curriculums. He instead idealized the one-room schoolhouse free of bureaucracy, saying that such liberty will allow teachers to get statistical results.
To achieve these goals, Fenty said he appointed Michelle Rhee, a woman who had no school administration experience but possessed a sense of urgency and the conviction that the D.C. school system can work.
According to Fenty, he and Rhee closed neighboring schools to diminish the waste of limited financial resources, reduced central administration employment in order to readdress the student to administrator ratio and engaged the controversial issue of underperforming teachers.
“It was ridiculous to think that you would try to reform the school system without addressing the issue of human capital,” Fenty said.
The renegotiation of the collective bargaining agreement and the institution of merit pay shifted the focus of the tenure system; teachers now must achieve certain standards dictated by a teacher evaluation program based on students’ yearly progress.
This new program resulted in the dismissal of 450 underperforming teachers, a political lightning rod that jeopardized Fenty’s popularity. According to Fenty, however, standardized test scores grew in the double digits, graduation rates annually increased and teachers who did meet the higher standards received significantly increased pay.
Fenty acknowledged the political risks he was taking in making such hard decisions but deliberately refused to scale back changes for political gain.
“Since we don’t know where the line is anyway, let’s just make as many tough decisions as possible and hopefully we won’t cross it,” Fenty said.
Despite the loss of the last mayoral election, Fenty defended his actions based on the tangible effect his changes have had on student and teacher performance within the D.C. school system.
“There is a lot more to public office than getting re-elected,” Fenty said.

Valerie Jarrett, senior adviser to President Obama, stressed the importance of passion and bravery in shaping current and future leaders in an address to about 200 students Wednesday.
“What sets leaders apart is their perseverance and courage, coupled with a really good sense of humor,” Jarrett said in her talk, which was part of the Marver H. Bernstein symposium on government reform.
The lecture, which aimed to foster a discussion of the trials and opportunities facing the U.S. government, was hosted by Georgetown’s department of government in the Fisher Colloquium.
Through vignettes grounded in her own experiences and those of Obama, Jarrett emphasized the importance of leadership in a rapidly changing and uncertain political and economic environment.
“It was an inspiring, optimistic outlook on Georgetown students’ potential impact on the world in light of the great adversity facing us today,” Kyle Zhu (SFS ‘14) said.
Jarrett also stressed personal engagement and ultimate devotion to one’s goals. She said she learned through six unhappy years as a lawyer that pursuing other people’s ideals does not necessarily lead to fulfillment. Jarrett instead turned to public service — she is the chair of the White House Council on Women and Girls and directs the Offices of Intergovernmental Affairs; Public Engagement; Urban Affairs and Olympic, Paralympic and Youth Sport — and encouraged all students to consider this as a career path.
“From my very first day, I knew I was exactly where I belong,” she said.
Jarrett further called on students to maintain their hard work ethic when they find themselves in challenging situations, particularly when attempting to create a consensus or compromise. This, she said, was a key component of leadership.
“If you cannot motivate people to work towards a common goal, you are merely an expert, not a leader,” Jarrett added.
This push for unity is integral to Obama’s platform of “winning the future,” she stated. Jarrett argued that Obama has firmly adhered to his goals, despite inheriting economic, education, health and energy crises.
“After listening to all perspectives, leaders are prepared to make the hard decisions and take everybody’s pain,” Jarrett said.
Jarrett added that Obama is now committed to increasing federal efficiency and passing comprehensive immigration reform.
“There’s still hard work ahead, but we have every reason to be optimistic,” she said.
Jarrett also stressed that the Obama administration has been willing to battle public disagreements and lower approval ratings in order to implement important measures.
“If you’re transformative, then by definition it’s controversial,” she said.
Jarrett concluded by reminding students of their role in mitigating the polarization that can seem to define political discourse.
“You have to understand the power you have.”

Georgetown’s Residential Judicial Council will hold its first-ever elections next week, aiming to transform the campus’ perception of the organization.
The council, which was put on hiatus this year but is slated to resume activities in the fall, will fill nine vacant seats with members of the rising sophomore, junior and senior classes.  Incoming freshmen will elect three more members after their arrival on the Hilltop in the fall.
Voting will be conducted exclusively online and is set to start at 9 a.m. on the morning of Monday, April 11 and conclude at 5 p.m. on April 13.  Eligible voters will have access to the platforms submitted by candidates outlining each person’s reasons for running.
On behalf of the RJC Steering Committee, Ed Gilhool, associate director of Residence Life, wrote in an email that the organization has received interest from members of the student body.
“Candidate applications for RJC council member positions have been coming in over the course of the past week,” he said, though he did not specify the number of applications submitted.
According to Gilhool, the RJC will not release the names of the candidates until April 11.
Elections form the first step in a plan created by the RJC Steering Committee, InterHall and the Office of Residence Life to revamp the council’s image in response to skepticism about its fairness and efficiency.
The council acts as a student-run panel that resolves minor infractions committed by university dorm and apartment residents according to the  Code of Student Conduct.
Since the council only judges residential disputes, just those students assigned to live in university housing during the 2011 to 2012 school year will be allowed to vote.
Former InterHall Vice President of Student Advocacy Shea Houlihan (SFS ’13), who helped to plan RJC’s return, believes that the council plays an important role on the Hilltop.
“RJC is really one of the few avenues where students can reach the administration in a meaningful way,” he said.  “RJC is unique. It is difficult to call a club. It serves a different function than most student groups on campus.”
Houlihan said that while he cannot predict students’ reactions to the RJC elections, he and his colleagues hope to receive positive responses.
“I think people should recognize RJC is one of the areas where students can not only build community but hold each other accountable,” he said.

Carlson Teboh (COL ’14) sits in the back of Saxbys, books piled high on the table.
There is a hint of a Cameroonian accent in his voice, the remnants of the 13 years that Teboh spent in the West African country before his family immigrated to the United States.
Unlike many of his classmates, Teboh hails from a low-income family background. In Cameroon, his father had been a doctor, and the family had been “fairly well off,” he explains. In the U.S., though, his father couldn’t continue his practice, so the family income dropped and paying for college became a formidable challenge.
Now in his second semester on the Hilltop, Teboh says that he owes his ability to take his place in the Class of 2014 to the Georgetown Scholarship Program, a university initiative that has provided him with a generous annual scholarship as well as the guidance he needs to explore his career options and navigate his classes.
“If it weren’t for the GSP, I wouldn’t be here,” he says. “They’re really about trying to help us out. They know the pressures that people on financial aid have with so many affluent students at Georgetown.”
GSP was founded in 2004 with the intention of bringing students who otherwise could not afford the university tuition and costs. At first a bare-bones project, the program has grown since its inception. This year, 150 GSP scholars joined the ranks of the Class of 2014 — an all-time high.
The initiative is now funded by the 1789 Scholarship Fund, which was established in 2009 with the goal of providing 1,789 scholarships of $25,000 each by 2014 while raising $500 million in funds. This push has helped GSP expand, providing a level of support to the recipients that sets the program apart.
For Teboh, the expansion helped make his dreams of coming to the Hilltop a reality.
“I really like it here,” Teboh says between bites of his frozen yogurt. “I feel like the Georgetown community is very accepting.”
GSP Director Missy Foy (COL ’03) can still recall the group’s modest beginnings: a small class of recipients with only a handful of activities. Foy was working in the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at the time, and she remembers ushering the first class onto campus in August 2005.
“We handed them pizza and said, ‘Congratulations and good luck. We know you have significant financial need, and we got you here with your financial aid package,'” she recalls. “I look back on this and think ‘Where was my heart and soul? Why didn’t I think that these kids might need a little extra?'”
It wasn’t until the following year that Foy realized how much difference the program could make for students on financial aid. In April 2006, GSP student Amy Hang (COL ’09) approached Foy and explained how difficult her first year had been in the new and foreign social environment. She suggested that the GSP develop an office to help the students with more than just their financial needs.
“That’s like the basis of everything we do, which is thinking about Amy and what she wanted this program to do,” Foy says.
Just five years later, the GSP has become its own office, replete with a corps of donors who give time and money lavishly and regularly. Foy and Assistant Director Christine Pfeil (COL ’10) spend their days coordinating donation projects and matching students with alumni advisers who can provide guidance and aid in unique ways.
For Teboh, that has meant a new jacket, textbooks and even a free dental exam. He has also been paired up with doctors who have taken him out to dinner to discuss his interest in pre-medical studies, which he says has given him a whole new perspective on the field.
In the GSP, that kind of help is not out of the ordinary. Donors have contributed gift cards for suits, treats for Christmas and even dinners for students who can’t afford to head home over holiday breaks. This year, one donor funded a slew of activities for students who stayed on campus for spring break including tickets to see “Shear Madness” at the Kennedy Center, meals at Ben’s Chili Bowl and tickets to see “The Fighter” at the West End Cinema.
“The donors really want to get to know the students,” Foy explains. “They want to see where their money is going.”
Susan Gilbert (SFS ’78) is just one example of the devoted alumni base that makes up the GSP battery. Gilbert, who has a son at Georgetown as well, has taken three students under her wing as an adviser. She even drove down from her home in Connecticut to pick up students at the airport on move-in day. She says that her involvement has been spurred on by her desire to expose GSP scholars to the wide range of career options that they may not even realize are open to them.
“If you’re coming from a socioeconomic background that isn’t as advantaged, you are suffering from a lack of exposure to your opportunities,” she explained. “Some of these kids don’t have the background to give them that.”
Many of the GSP scholars, like Rachel Clune (COL ’11), are first-generation college students. Back at home in Dayton, Ohio, Clune’s father works as a salesman in heating and air conditioning, and her mother is a customer service representative. Clune, however, is planning to attend law school at either, she hopes, Georgetown or the University of Notre Dame. With career advice through the GSP, she has mapped out a path several years in advance.
Clune plans to begin giving back to the GSP as soon as she can.
“In the next five years, we aren’t going to be able to give back, but that’s something we are looking forward to doing,” she says.
Former GSP students already give back at a higher percentage than their peers both financially and as advisers, citing the influence of the donors that they encountered while undergraduates.
“It’s nice to know that someone didn’t just write a check,” Clune adds. “They care a lot about us, too.”
Back in Foy’s office, it is obvious that she and Pfeil relish their work. With brilliant smiles, they recount all the letters and emails that they have received from grateful parents, though both of them agree that the donors and students really deserve the credit.
Gilbert sees a different side of the story.
“Christine and Missy are doing an amazing job,” she says. “They are always forward-thinking and always developing the program for the students.”
As the program continues to advance, so does the love that Foy and Pfeil share for their jobs. Commenting on how instrumental the students are to what they do, Foy pauses to admire the university’s swelling support of the GSP and to marvel at the effects of her work.
“How great that the university is willing to pay our salaries to be here to help,” Foy says, looking over to Pfeil. “We feel really lucky and blessed to know the students.”

Visiting authors stressed that their narratives can be critical resources for displaced immigrants attempting to assimilate while maintaining their original identity.
The Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Practice’s lecture series, “Writing Dangerously in Immigrant America: Violence Politics, Diaspora Histories and the Poetics of Survival,” engaged members of the campus community with stories of courage and struggle among Central and Latin American immigrants on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The presenting authors, artists and scholars, all of whom are familiar with diaspora immigrant communities from the Caribbean, Central America and Mexico, attempted to uncover the roots of the struggle that results from living in a foreign community.
Co-sponsored by The Americas Initiative and the Comparative Literature Program, the two-day event opened with a talk by Junot Díaz, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of “The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao” and Massachusetts Institute of Technology creative writing professor, in Gaston Hall.
“Most countries do not like to think that the very essence of who or what they are can be recreated by people who they have sent elsewhere,” Díaz said. “History shows us that … the ability of immigrants to regenerate not only the nation in which they arrive, but also the nation they left.”
The diversity of Georgetown students who come from first- or second-generation immigrant families resounded throughout discussions on the divide in sociopolitical implications of the presenters, some of whom emigrated from state-sponsored regimes of violence and political corruption.
The second day featured writers Edwidge Danticat, Charles Bowden, Hector Tobar and Quique Avilés in Copley Formal Lounge and concluded with readings by poets Juan Felipe Herrera and Cristina García in the Gonda Theater.
Danticat, winner of the 2007 National Book Critics Circle Award, continued to discuss her personal experience of losing a cousin in the Haitian earthquake and the resulting diaspora.
“Immediately people would call me to say things, to write things,” Danticat said. “It came through in those moments about not writing before catastrophe or writing beyond catastrophe, but writing, as Walter Benjamin says, through catastrophe.”
The causes of migration — from natural disasters to oppressive regimes — highlighted the multiculturalism among the presenters. Bowden and Tobar, who addressed issues from the Cold War to narcotrafficking and border disputes, compared their individual experiences.
The gains found through taking authoritative risks became a guiding theme for the presenters, who have each succeeded in spreading their message despite being stifled by oppressive authorities.
This message resonated with the audience, which felt that the immigrants’ shared experience transcended cultural backgrounds.
“I’ve had many students who are immigrants, but I think the appeal of these writers extends to everyone, not just immigrants,” said Adam Lifshey, an assistant professor in the Spanish and Portuguese departments. “These students should come here because these are important writers whose voices deserve to be heard.”

On heard the top three proposals for spending the $3.4 million left behind by SAFE Reform at Tuesday’s meeting, and according to the commission’s chairperson, each is a contender for a slice of the pie.
The proposals presented at the meeting include installing solar panels on university townhouses, funding a Social Innovation and Public Service fund and bringing back Healy Pub. The commission decided to further consider these three proposals, which will be up for public comment at a town hall meeting on Saturday along with all other proposals received at this point.
According to Andrew Curtis (MSB ’11), the Georgetown University Students Association Endowment Commission chairperson, each of the proposals has a serious chance of receiving part of $3.4 million that the commission is charged with allocating.
“The proposals we heard were very thoughtful, well-researched and had support from a large base of students and alumni,” he said. “It was great to see that these groups were thinking big about the endowment and how large chunks of the endowment could be allocated to benefit a wide range of students.”
Georgetown Energy, which advocates for the use of solar power, proposed the installation of solar panels on 43 of the university’s townhouses. The venture would cost $163,399, with a completion date set for fall of 2012.
According to co-founder of Georgetown Energy Anthony Conyers (COL ’12), the project would be implemented over summer 2012 to avoid disrupting students living in university housing during the academic year. Conyers said that each installation will take less than 48 hours, and residents can carry on normally inside the house during the process.
Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and Nick Troiano (COL ’11) presented the SIPS fund, which would be available to any student who wished to apply for money to support a community service oriented project or one deemed applicable by the administrative board.
“The SIPS fund would be geared towards fostering service and encouraging students to become socially minded leaders while here at Georgetown,” Gustafson said.
While commissioners pointed out that there are similar groups already on campus such as HoyaInnovation  that could provide funding to service groups, supporters said that SIPS would partner with, rather than replacing or overlapping with, other campus groups.
Chris Pigott (COL ’12) advocated that the entire $3.4 million fund should go to the creation of the Healy Pub, a restaurant, bar, student lounge and performance venue modeled after the historic Healy Pub, which sat in the basement of Healy Hall until 1988.
Pigott said he had discussed the project with alumni and found that they felt that there was no place currently on campus that truly captured the spirit of Georgetown.
“There is no real center of student life,” he said.
According to the proposal, the pub is intended to bring students’ social life back to campus and thus help alleviate safety issues of late-night traipsing back to the Hilltop. Although the commission raised concerns about getting neighborhood approval for such a space, particularly because it would sell alcohol, Pigott pointed to a unanimous 2006 decision by Georgetown’s Advisory Neighborhood Commission that prohibited the banning of kegs on Georgetown’s campus.
According to Curtis, the commission expects to receive a few more proposals before the April 10 deadline. These proposals will be heard on April 12, after which the commission will begin to debate.
“The commission will meet pretty regularly to narrow down and deliberate proposals, since we haven’t really had much of a chance yet to discuss internally what we’ve heard,” he said.

There are about 4,095 female undergraduates at Georgetown. Statistically speaking, 819 of them will experience sexual violence before the end of their time on the Hilltop.
Sexual and gender-based violence, though often overlooked, is a pervasive issue on college campuses. Studies estimate that 20 to 25 percent of women and 3 percent of men are victims of forced sex during their time at college. However, few of these crimes get reported and critics accuse colleges of not doing enough to punish perpetrators or engage students in a discussion about the issues.
“It’s so prevalent but so hush-hush,” Danielle LoVallo (SFS ’11) said. LoVallo is co-chair of Take Back the Night, a campus group that organizes advocacy programming for issues of sexual and gender-based violence.
“That trend should cause concern but also a need to challenge it,” she said.
At Georgetown, between five and 10 incidents of forced sex are reported every year. According to Joseph Smith, associate director of the Department of Public Safety, these represent a small fraction of the total assaults that actually
occur.
“The vast majority [of assaults on campus] are acquaintance assaults [and] most of those are not reported to DPS,” Smith said. He estimated that roughly one in 12 instances of on-campus sexual assault is reported to DPS.
“It’s particularly difficult for a female to report an assault when it’s from someone they know. There are so many other dynamics to deal with. They may be embarrassed — perhaps they don’t want to get somebody in trouble,” Smith said. “When you have an acquaintance there are these social dynamics that make it more difficult psychologically for someone to report it to the police.”
 
College Judicial Systems:
“Re-Victimizing the Victim”
Despite the prevalence of sexual assault, college campuses have not always dealt with the touchy topic well. A six-part series titled “Sexual Assault on Campus: A Frustrating Search for Justice,” released by the Center for Public Integrity last year, found that sexual violence is not handled appropriately by college administrators.
“Students deemed ‘responsible’ for alleged sexual assaults on college campuses can face little or no consequence for their acts. Yet their victims’ lives are frequently turned upside down. For them, the trauma of assault can be compounded by a lack of institutional support, and even disciplinary action,” the report said.
These fears are echoed at Georgetown, as students have sometimes questioned the support system in place on campus for victims of sexual assault.
In 2003, Kate Dieringer (NHS ’05) and the nonprofit group Security On Campus Inc. filed a joint complaint against the university after the male student who raped Dieringer her freshman year was suspended for a year, rather than expelled, as The Hoya reported in 2003 (“Disclosure Subject to Federal Scrutiny” A1, April 29, 2003).
Dieringer said that a lack of support from the university made the process of reporting her rape all the more painful.
“I was met with opposition from the beginning from the [Office of Student Conduct]. The director … called me a ‘woman scorned’ and the hearing process was unbelievably in my rapist’s favor,” Dieringer wrote in a testimony on the website of an advocacy group called Campus Justice, which calls for colleges to have more open disclosure policies.
In her complaint, Dieringer protested the university policy that required victims to sign a confidentiality agreement if they wanted to know the sanction imposed on the person found responsible.
“It takes so much strength, support and courage for a victim just to come forward. To silence him/her after they entrust you with their most guarded possession — trust (which has already been broken) — is to re-victimize the victim, abuse them and deter them from healing,” Dieringer wrote.
“[The university’s confidentiality policy] only encouraged me to be silent about my rape and was detrimental to the healing process that I was trying to accomplish in order to regain my life back. The adjudication set me back in moving forward.”
The university’s sexual assault policies were revised in 2004, establishing new definitions for consent, sexual misconduct and sexual assault, as well as modifying Georgetown’s disclosure policy.
“It’s now our policy that complainants are entitled to know the outcome,” said Judy Johnson, director of the Office of Student Conduct.
Victims are still required to sign a nondisclosure agreement, though they are now allowed to share information about the outcome with their parents and their adviser.
 
Not Tough Enough
Still, critics feel that the college disciplinary process remains too weak.
“On many campuses, abusive students face little more than slaps on the wrist,” the CPI report said.
Because perpetrators are tried within college judicial systems and not criminal courts, punishments are meant to be educational rather than punitive. Consequently, the verdicts reached during on-campus judicial proceedings are often much less harsh than the decisions an outside court would have come to.
“We do not try to simulate the court system. It’s an educational process; it’s an administrative process,” Johnson said of the adjudication protocol.
According to Johnson, cases of sexual misconduct are only brought to the Office of Student Conduct once every few years. A hearing is held at which the complainant and the accused can each call witnesses and make their case, and a board of three students and two faculty determine responsibility and sanctions.
According to Johnson, the board’s primary concerns in determining sanctions are “the impact on the complainant, the ongoing danger to the community and the individual’s ability to understand the harm he or she has done,” she said.
“There is a punitive aspect but of all the objectives that is the least.”
According to the CPI report, 75 to 90 percent of punishments against perpetrators of sexual violence given out by schools that report statistics amount to minor sanctions, and colleges only expel 10 to 25 percent of students who are found guilty of sexual assault.
Many students — as many as 58 percent according to the CPI report — found guilty of assault commit repeat offenses. The report said there was a “troubling plague of repeat offenders” on college campuses.
 
Deflecting the Blame
Beyond inadequate reporting and punitive mechanisms, critics say that colleges deal with a simple lack of understanding.
“The prevalence of rape myths is really common on college campuses, particularly at Georgetown,” LoVallo said.
Among these myths is the assumption that most rapes are committed by strangers.
“We may have this image of walking through Georgetown late at night and a stranger assaults somebody. That does happen occasionally, but actually more frequently it’s an acquaintance. It could be a date or a friend,” Smith said.
LoVallo said that rape myths often cause people to blame victims.
“I don’t think that our society in general is very friendly to victims. Particularly on college campuses we kind of stereotype them. You know, saying, ‘If she didn’t get drunk or she didn’t wear those clothes, it wouldn’t have happened,'” she said.
Kelly Sawyers (COL ’11) can attest to this. She was harassed by a DPS officer while sitting outside New South on Monday afternoon.
“The DPS officer kept looking at me in this really accusatory way,” said Sawyers, a Hoya staff writer. Eventually, the officer approached Sawyer and told her that he had been looking at her because he felt that she was dressed inappropriately.
“He said that [he] asked himself, ‘Should I keep looking at her? Yes, God is telling me I can keep looking at her because of what she is wearing,'” Sawyers said. “I was flabbergasted by it. … It seemed so unbelievably strange.”
“It was so obvious that he was trying to use this authority he had as a DPS officer to intimidate me [when] he was supposed to be a representative of the university; he was supposed to be there to protect me. … If that’s the way he acts then what does that say about the university?” she added.
A friend told Sawyers to go to the Women’s Center, which she did. She also met with representatives from DPS. Though the meeting went well, Sawyers was upset when she was asked about what she had been wearing.
“By saying that, they were implying that I could have put myself in that situation, when really there’s no situation where that would have made it OK to say what he did,” Sawyers said.
According to Jen Schweer, the university’s full-time sexual assault and relationship violence coordinator, even the university’s best efforts to help students can have negative consequences.
“Many times, when we think of traditional prevention programs, we think of self-defense, rape whistles and ‘what women should and shouldn’t do.’ While all of these risk-reduction programs have their place in the larger conversation, they are not a solution to ending the violence. Rather, these groups and programs focus on the larger picture and culture that contributes to victim-blaming,” Schweer wrote in an email.
“We have to think about how we are holding perpetrators accountable, addressing rape myths and eliminating victim-blaming language. By engaging our community in these conversations, we are creating a climate that supports survivors when they come forward and sends the very strong message that this crime is not one that is accepted at Georgetown,” she added.
Laura Kovach, the director of the Women’s Center, emphasized that sexual violence is not just a woman’s issue.
“Acts of violence affect all of us. Gender violence is a community issue that impacts friends, classmates, neighbors, family members, et cetera. By putting the weight of preventing sexual assault on the shoulders of women, we ignore men as allies and men as survivors and unfortunately take the blame away from where it belongs: on the perpetrators. Perpetrators are responsible and must be held accountable for their crimes,” Kovach wrote in an email.
 
Facing the Issue in Georgetown’s Backyard
Additionally, some students feel that Georgetown is reluctant to deal with such a tough subject.
“There’s a culture around the university that there’s a stigma around women’s issues,” Sawyers said. “Because of the university’s stance on reproductive rights, they have unnecessarily lumped all gender issues together and pushed them aside. That is making them not stand up for women when they should.”
“Even in the student body there’s this sense that people have stereotyped the student groups that deal with gender issues,” she added.
According to LoVallo, students are also unaware of how serious sexual violence can be on their own campus.
“We have a community that’s very grounded in issues of social activism and community engagement, but I do think that at a more personal level at the campus level we’re pretty ignorant,” she said.
“Georgetown is very good at educating the whole person but that often means for Georgetown students that we’re looking outside of our backyard of our own community. You can be totally educated about the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and rape as a weapon of war but not necessarily so comfortable talking about what goes on our campus, what goes on a Friday or Saturday night.”
Nevertheless, LoVallo and Sawyers praised the resources that the university does provide.
“I can’t talk enough about how amazing [the Women’s Center] was,” Sawyers said. “As soon as I went in there they told me, ‘This is a safe place.'”
In addition to Schweer and the Women’s Center, Georgetown has a sexual assault working group, the LGBTQ Resource Center and sexual abuse specialists at Counseling and Psychiatric Services to help students deal with these issues.
In addition, groups like Take Back the Night and GU Men for Change work on campus to raise awareness about issues of sexual violence. Take Back the Night will be holding a number of events throughout April in honor of Sexual Assault Awareness Month.
“Just having activism around it [is important],” LoVallo said. “Seeing people really care about these issues and learning about these issues, being invested in it. No one wants this to happen to any of their friends, but unfortunately it does. That’s why we need to be educated to deal with it. In a very serious situation your friends are counting on you.”

The announcement of a doctoral candidate’s sudden collapse and death shocked many members of the campus community on Tuesday afternoon, with former students and fellow professors expressing grief and confusion at the passing of their teacher, friend and peer.
Evan North fell after exercising in Yates Field House Monday afternoon and was pronounced dead upon arrival at the Georgetown University Hospital.
“We are having a hard time wrapping our minds around this … our hearts go out to Evan’s parents and loved ones,” history department chair Aviel Roshwald said in an email.
North was pursuing a doctorate in history and served as a teaching assistant in the department at the time of his death.
“Evan was such a valued member of the department, much loved as a
friend by many of his fellow graduate students and held in deep affection and respect by the faculty. He was a truly humble person of great talent and with a passionate thirst for knowledge, which he also imparted to his students in classes where he taught as a TA,” Roshwald said.
Tony Lin (MSB ’14), who was in North’s discussion section for professor Katherine Benton-Cohen’s U.S. History Since 1865 course, said that he felt a mixture of shock and surprise.
“When I heard that someone had died, I assumed it would be an elderly member of the community,” he said. “I was in shock for a good minute or so.”
Lin described North as “soft-spoken, exceedingly nice, someone who definitely cared about his subject and a pretty good TA.”
Benton-Cohen sent out an email to students in her class on Tuesday afternoon, about an hour and a half before the university sent out a broadcast message notifying the community of the death.
“Evan joined the history department’s master’s and Ph.D. programs several years ago. He won the respect and affection of faculty and students alike, and was the beloved friend of many in the history department. I delighted in his enthusiasm, good nature and open-mindedness. This is an unfathomable loss,” Benton-Cohen said in the email.
North’s family has been notified, and students can send them notes of condolence, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said in the broadcast message. A memorial service is set for 10 a.m. on April 16 in Dahlgren Chapel.
According to the broadcast email, North collapsed inside the gymnasium. Yates staff responded immediately and notified Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Services.
According to GERMS President Colin Brody (COL ’11), GERMS was dispatched at 4:14 p.m., within five minutes of the initial call. Pete Piringer, spokesman for D.C. Fire and Emergency Services, said that his unit was dispatched at 4:18 p.m. but that GERMS was already on the scene upon their arrival.
“We were able to activate advanced life support units of D.C. Fire and EMS and they assisted us in transporting him to the hospital,” Brody said.
Brody added that the cause of death is unclear at this time and might take weeks to determine.

The George Washington University recently announced that 144 students will live in gender-neutral housing starting in the fall of 2011, the first semester the university will offer this option.
The push for  housing is gaining steam across the nation, as larger universities like Rutgers University and The University of California-Berkeley have already approved the measure for the coming year. Over 50 universities nationwide currently offer some form of mixed-gender housing, according to the Arizona Republic.
At GWU, Allied in Pride, a student group that advocates for and provides support for LGBTQ students, was the primary force in convincing the university to accept the new arrangement, aided by the Student Association Senate, according to The GW Hatchet.
The presence of programs called Living and Learning Cohorts at GWU has also contributed to the desire for mixed-gender rooms. One of the cohorts, Escaping Gender, allowed students of the opposite sex to live with each other, according to a Dec. 3 article in The Hoya.
Students who requested gender-neutral housing were included in the same lottery system as single-gender pairs for residence hall rooms.
Discussion around gender-blind housing options at Georgetown began when the Georgetown University Student Association Senate passed a resolution encouraging the university to consider the option.

Georgetown University Medical Center received $28.9 million in federal research grants between early 2009 and September 2010, GUMC said in a statement released Tuesday.
The funds have been allocated among 35 scientists and physicians representing various fields of study, including pharmacology, oncology, neuroscience and others and will help to remedy the mounting funding pressures GUMC faces.
The funds come from the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, of which the National Institutes of Health received a portion.
Robert Clarke, vice president and dean for research at GUMC, said that federal grants like the ARRA, which targets the broader biomedical research sector of the economy, are unusual.
“It is rare for the federal government to provide a large amount of additional funding to support the nation’s research enterprise,” he said.
Clarke said the federal grants are welcome relief from government funding shortages that have reached record levels in recent years.
“GUMC is not alone in facing the most restricted level of government funding for NIH and its biomedical research community in probably the past 25 years, or perhaps the entire history of NIH. … For example, an established investigator in cancer is predicted to have a 93 percent chance of their grant not being funded,” he said.
The recipients of the funds will use the money to undertake a variety of studies, including one on neuron stimuli and another on diet-induced obesity.
Clarke touted ARRA’s decision to grant funds to GUMC as a testament to the strength of its research team.
“It is a testament to the quality of research and the dedication of our faculty that we continue to compete effectively with the very best researchers in the United States,” he said.

The clock is ticking on a government shutdown that would have negative implications for the university and the District.
Congress and President Obama have until 11:59 p.m. today to finalize and sign a budget extension, or all of the non-essential functions of the federal government will grind to a halt.
The likeliness of a shutdown is still up for debate, but many signs seem to be indicating at least a short-term shutdown.
“If I were to guess, I would guess there will be a government shutdown for a short time,” Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming said.
According to Fleming, this could mean issues in two specific areas for the university. Student visa processing and paperwork would be held up and federal loan disbursements for students receiving them as part of financial aid packages would be put on hold.
“It would be the embassies where [a shutdown] would be a problem,” Director of International Student and Scholar Services Helene Robertson said.
Robertson said that the duration of any government shutdown would determine how serious these potential issues would turn out to be but cited two specific areas where current students may see problems. She said that international students who wish to travel abroad and currently have deadlines and paperwork in process for renewing entry visas may see complications in their ability to travel or return to the United States.
Current international students applying for an “optional practical training” visa to work in the United States in their specific field either over the summer or following graduation may face issues and processing delay
Ds if a government shutdown were to occur.
Robertson said her office has not yet been in contact with those students who may be affected by a shutdown because they are waiting for this to play out, but that they are drafting a message to send to students in the event of a shutdown.
Disbursements of federal student loans would also be delayed, though disbursements are not common this time of year. This would have an impact on the university receiving the funds from federal loans such as the Federal Stafford or Federal Perkins Loans that qualified students have taken as part of their financial aid packages.
There will also be noticeable impacts on the District. All of the Smithsonian museums and national parks would lock their doors and close their gates. Also, the National Cherry Blossom Festival Parade scheduled for Saturday would be cancelled.
When it comes to the severity of a potential shutdown it is about the duration; a weekend shutdown would probably not cause serious issues, according to Fleming.
Fleming was also optimistic about Congress closing a deal by at least next Friday, when there is a two-week district work period planned, for which many members of Congress have already scheduled events back home.
“If you look back historically, there is most likely a history of Congress solving issues like this before going out of session,” Fleming said.
The last federal government shutdown occurred in 1995-1996 and lasted 27 days.

Though college students are often involved in volunteer work and online political activity, they continue to distrust the federal government, a recent survey conducted by Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government said.
According to the survey, the percentage of college students who said that they do not trust the federal government to do the right thing all or most of the time has remained consistent at 64 percent since 2000.
Georgetown students expressed similar views. Clare Tilton (COL ’13) said that she thinks U.S. politicians are not living up to their potential to effect positive change.
“Theoretically speaking, I firmly believe that the federal government has a lot of capacity to do a lot of good. But right now it would be hard to deny that the government has trouble doing much of anything,” Tilton said. “I think that politics has been getting in the way of governing a lot, and that can be very disillusioning.”
Students also say that their experiences at Georgetown, situated in the nation’s capital, influence their view of government and add to their political engagement.
“Especially being at Georgetown and taking classes about foreign policy, it’s changed the way I see how government works in general,” Judy Shing (COL ’13) said.
Samuel Dulik (SFS ’13), director of communications for the Georgetown University College Republicans, praised Georgetown students’ commitment to politics.
“Georgetown students are some of the most engaged and impassioned in the country when it comes to political issues,” Dulik wrote in an email.
Georgetown College Democrats President Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ‘13) said that the university’s core values contribute to students’ interest in government.
“Georgetown students are savvy enough to know that participation in politics is important, and it does matter,” she said. “I think it is Georgetown’s emphasis on being men and women for others that animates so many of our students toward involvement in government and public service.”
Politicians’ use of social media has also influenced the way college students engage in politics.
Though 60 percent of students in the Harvard survey named national newspapers as their preferred source of political news, 42 percent said they chose Facebook to gather information. College students are more likely than others of their generation to use the social networking site — 90 percent of those enrolled at four-year universities are members, as opposed to 80 percent of all 18- to 29-year-olds nationwide, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education.
Of the survey respondents, 32 percent said they shared their political views on Facebook, while 29 percent had advocated a political position in a status update.
This focus on social media is also apparent on the Hilltop. Shing reads a number of foreign policy blogs, which she said she finds valuable and relevant to her studies at Georgetown.
Kate Newman (COL ’13) follows the White House on Twitter.
“I think it’s good [that the government is] embracing social media,” Newman said.
The White House also maintains a Facebook page, as do the Department of State, the Federal Courts and the Environmental Protection Agency.
Newman said she believes, however, that the federal government could make even more of an effort to connect to college students and members of their generation.
“I think that they could reach out to youth more,” she said.

Though students often bemoan Georgetown’s  patchy wireless Internet, Georgetown is making strides to keep pace with today’s online trends — and it has been rewarded.
StudentAdvisor.com recently placed Georgetown 58th on its list of “Top 100 Social Media Colleges.” The website, geared towards college-bound students, describes, ranks and compares over 6,000 colleges. It cited Georgetown’s use of the iTunes U application, which allows the university to post lectures, lab demonstrations and other course material online, as a factor in the high ranking.
“Georgetown just revamped its iTunes U audio and video presence, now it just needs fresh content,” according to the website.
For students, the iTunes U application, available along with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Foursquare and Flickr links, increases Georgetown’s 21st century appeal.
Denis Peskov (SFS ’14) believes that in the future, prospective students will check out the new media available and let it play an even greater role of the college decision process.
“When I was applying to Georgetown I didn’t think to look at the school’s Facebook page or anything,” Peskov said. “But I think that now prospective students have such a greater variety of ways to be exposed to the school.”
On Dec. 3 the university unveiled a new website with a homepage redesigned for the first time since 2002. Associate Vice President for Communications Julie Bataille discussed the features the website offers.
“The new website responds to what we heard our users want — clear navigational pathways, more rich media, ways to engage with Georgetown online and information based on topic rather than organizational structure,” Bataille said.
For smartphone users, the university’s mobile website offers quick access to news and events, the Georgetown directory and the Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle schedule.
Other technological leaps include  President John J. DeGioia’s Facebook and video posts of speakers and notable on-campus events on Georgetown’s Web page. New Student Orientation also has a comprehensive online guide to getting adjusted to Georgetown.
However, Georgetown lags behind the many schools ranked higher on                                                                               StudentAdvisor.com’s list. Columbia University, which ranked seventh, offers two social media directories of alumni and current students and faculty.
Columbia freshman Lucas Rehaut praised the comprehensiveness of his school’s online resources, but felt that their organization could be improved.
“Columbia’s social media isn’t as centralized as I think it should be, but there are sites for virtually everything you need: CourseWorks for classes, Columbia’s student blog or Facebook pages for almost every major club on campus,” Rehaut said. “There’s something online for everything, it’s just sometimes tricky to find.”
Georgetown students have recently begun calling attention to the ways in which the university is trailing behind in technological advancements. Georgetown University Technology Awareness 2011 started as a class project but has turned into an open forum for students to express their need for more innovative technology.
It seeks “to highlight the glaring technological deficiencies at Georgetown,” according to the organization’s blog.
While they must wait for improved wi-fi and better online resources, students can like Jack the Bulldog’s Facebook page right now.

At times, the testimonials are carefree — “I’m really happy we’re friends”  — but with posts like, “College has destroyed my confidence,” Hoyas Anonymous has a more weighty set of stories to share.
Three years after its launch, the website gives students an anonymous outlet for thoughts ranging from relationship struggles to the fear of graduating, body and social image concerns to suicide.
Hoyas Anonymous finds its roots in a 2008 School of Nursing and Health Studies class project. Today, project leaders said it gets about 1,500 hits daily, always evolving as a resource for Georgetown students seeking emotional support.
“The point of Hoyas Anonymous is for people to have an opportunity and venue to say secrets about themselves and realize that all people at Georgetown are coming from a similar base of experience,” Kylie Sago (COL ’13), co-president of Hoyas Anonymous, said.
Co-President Kelley Kidd (SFS ’13) said the website also hopes to challenge the stereotype of a flawless, high-achieving Georgetown student.
“Ideally, we want it to be a place where people can realize that not everyone is living the idealized Jack and Jane Hoya lifestyle,” she said. “I love the idea of creating a culture at Georgetown where people realize it’s OK not to be perfect.”
And on Hoyas Anonymous, posters share experiences they may not otherwise expose to their peers.
“I have bipolar disorder and I wish I could tell someone here about it without them thinking I’m a freak and leaving. Just one person. Please?”
Pleas for help like this stand alongside frank admissions from students: “I spent most of my last hookup thinking about someone else,” one poster said, just as another a few entries down reflected on the meaning of friendship and family in life.
Students are able to give a voice to oft-stifled thoughts by dropping unsigned Post-it notes in one of the Hoyas Anonymous boxes at The Midnight Mug or Uncommon Grounds.
“I don’t really notice it,” Alex Mark (MSB ’12), director of Midnight Mug, said. “But I think people would want to be discreet about it.”
Students are also welcome to email in messages or respond to others’ posts on the website.
For Sago, these responses are one of the most valuable components of the website.
“A lot of those comments are of gratitude — somebody gets it,” Sago said. “If students want to help, they can post their own secrets or they can comment and respond with advice.”
Carol Day, director of Health Education Services and an adviser for the website, said that a shared sense of experience that makes the site appealing to students.
“It’s a way to put yourself out there without being on your Facebook page — of saying ‘We’re all sort of struggling with these things,'” Day said. “You think you are the only person that has this kind of thought and then you can see other people respond to it — they’re empathetic, they can relate to it, they’re supportive.”
Website reader Erica Hanichak (SFS ’14) agreed that Hoyas Anonymous brings students together.
“It’s a forum in which students may unite over their humanity, a constant reminder of our shared experiences at Georgetown. We find that even the secrets we guard most jealously are not as outlandish as we first may have thought,” she said.
Now that is has gained ground with its note boxes, Hoyas Anonymous hopes to increase awareness of the resources available by tabling in Red Square and initiating a poster campaign.
“We’re still fairly small and working on visibility as a long-term project,” Kidd said.
In 2008, Brigitte Granger (NHS ’10) proposed the site as a project for her Health Promotion and Disease Prevention class, modeling the format after the popular website PostSecret. Hoyas Anonymous works today in conjunction with Georgetown’s Health Education Services, and refers the website’s visitors to campus resources for combating depression, eating disorders and various other issues.
Granger said she hoped to create an easily accessible support network for students with her initiative.
“There is a lot of pressure [here],” she said. “A lot of people just aren’t being asked or they don’t want to tell you, but they need an outlet.”
Some students find outlets in posting anonymous gossip, a habit Granger said she hoped to combat.
“I saw we were going in the wrong direction and putting people down because we don’t know who they are,” Granger said. “Instead, anonymity can be used to connect with people.”
The site will not post derogatory or signed comments, and its leadership is working on a protocol to respond to possible emergencies.
In the case that a comment is a cause for concern, the website requires that contributors provide their email address. Kidd said that her team has not had to follow up on any posts to date.
Some students, however, worry about the feasibility for the submissions to generate long-term solutions, given the lack of follow-up with respondents due to anonymity.
“I’m worried that it would be hard to connect with someone in a way that’s meaningful,” Chloe Coughlin-Schulte (SFS ’14) said.
While the site administrators have considered facilitating deeper connections among contributors, Kidd said maintaining anonymity is the first priority.
“I understand that concern and it’s something we’ve thought a lot about, because a lot of people earlier this year said they wished they could meet each other,” she said. “But that’s just a limitation of the design of the site, because we just can’t breach anonymity in any way.”
Ultimately, the goal is to spur a change in campus culture, according to Kidd.
“If we could make Georgetown a more open culture where people see they’re in an environment where it’s OK to go through what they’re going through, that would be fantastic.”

Georgetown’s dining workers officially united on Tuesday when employer Aramark Higher Education certified their union, according to David Schwartz (SFS ’12), a leader in the unionization efforts that have been going on for several months.
The union, which represents workers from O’Donovan Hall, the Jesuit Residence, Cosi, Starbucks and the Preclinical Building’s Dr. Mug, will operate under the umbrella of UNITE HERE, a labor union that assists over 90,000 food service employees worldwide.
“The workers are excited about engaging in their first contract negotiations as a union,” Schwartz said of the talks with Aramark, which are set to begin soon.
“Now, we must stick together to push ahead and achieve everything we are fighting for; things like better treatment, affordable medical insurance, and fair raises for the hard work that we do,” union worker Rafael Benitez said in a press release today.
“We, the workers of Leo’s, banded together to fight for our right to be treated with dignity and respected as valued the employees we are and to be paid as such,” Cathy Andersan also said in a press release. “We have a voice and we want to be heard.
Schwartz and other students and administrators have been coordinating with the workers in their push to unionize since July.
The current minimum wage for dining workers on the Hilltop comes out to $11.34, which can make it difficult for employees to cover health care costs, Schwartz said in February.
“Some of the demands that the workers had were over higher pay and over the way the company treats them,” said Gianna Puccinelli, a part-time worker at Starbucks who is considering joining the union.
On Feb. 9, about 80 percent of workers signed a request to Aramark asking the food service company to remain  neutral if the workers wanted to form a union.
“Aramark is neither anti-union, nor pro-union. However, we would note that for half a century, Aramark has enjoyed excellent relationships with the 35-plus different unions that represent our employees,” Karen Cutler, director of Aramark communications, said in an email at the time.
During the unionization process, the university has supported the workers, some of whom have been at Georgetown for as long as 30 years. In a letter sent to Aramark on Feb. 3, Associate Vice President of Auxiliary Services and Assistant Vice President of Business Policy Planning LaMarr Billups affirmed Georgetown’s commitment to its workers.
Schwartz said that the student and faculty advisory group will also continue to be closely involved in the negotiations.
A few hundred students, including leaders of prominent campus groups such as Georgetown University College Democrats, NAACP, Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán and EcoAction, as well as 30 faculty members and administrators, have been meeting with the workers since July to discuss the prospect of unionization.
A press release sent April 1 by Schwartz detailed the student backers’ next steps, saying that students will visually demonstrate their support for the workers and their unionization efforts over the next few days. The group also plans to continue their involvement in the contract negotiation process.
“My sincere thanks go to the students, the professors and the various organizations that stand with us in this endeavor. Much thanks goes out also to my fellow committee members and organizers,” Anderson concluded in her April 7 statement.
Aramark and university officials could not be reached for comment.

For Georgetown’s tenure candidates, making the jump to permanent status comes with its fair share of hurdles — but administrators say a standout guidance process is the key to an acceptance rate of more than 50 percent.
The rigorous tenure application system, an entrenched component of most research universities across the United States, determines which professors will continue to contribute to the scholarship of the school with academic free reign — and national data indicate a drastic decline in tenure track faculty.
According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, in 1975 the ratio of tenure track to non-tenure track faculty was 57 percent to 30 percent. In 2007, it had switched to 30 percent to 50 percent.
But the numbers don’t hold on the Hilltop, according to University Provost James O’Donnell.
“At Georgetown we have not seen that phenomenon. We have both grown our tenured faculty and non-tenured faculty in the course of the last 20 years fairly dramatically,” O’Donnell said. “If a university abolished tenure, it would have trouble recruiting faculty. But that wouldn’t be the most startling thing about such an act. You’d really be asking the deeper question of, ‘Just what is this institution committed to?'” he added.
According to the provost’s rough calculations, for the 700 full-time, main campus faculty, 400 are tenured, 100 are tenure track and 200 are non-tenure track professors. O’Donnell says that Georgetown tries to strike a balance between the two types of hires.
“For us, getting the right mix of the career-tenured academic commitment and the special quality of instruction that you can get off the tenure track, especially in Washington, D.C., is an interesting part of my job,” he said.
According to O’Donnell, the benefits of the Hilltop’s tenure system arrangement are evident.
“If you like our faculty and you like what we do here, then you do, in fact, like our tenure system,” he said.
O’Donnell said the emphasis on supporting junior faculty on their way to tenure and the high percentage of faculty members who are successful in securing tenure — consistently more than half the applicants — sets Georgetown’s tenure system apart.
When these applicants are hired for a tenure track position, they know they have seven years at Georgetown to prove themselves worthy. Most apply for tenure in their sixth year and in rare cases, if denied, faculty can reapply for a final chance in their seventh.
“It’s a pretty challenging period in one’s life as an academic. One feels a lot of pressure to do what you need to do to get tenure. … Most of us want to keep our job,” said David Edelstein, who applied and received tenure last year with joint appointments in the College’s government department and in the School of Foreign Service.
The Trail to Tenure
An applicant’s preparation begins early in his or her sixth year at Georgetown, starting in September or earlier, as the tenure clock runs on the academic year.
Applicants spend time compiling every significant piece of academic writing they have published, writing a personal statement about the mission of their scholarship and assembling a dossier that demonstrates their record of scholarship, teaching and service to the university — the three main components of the tenure decision.
After candidates submit this package, they anxiously await an answer for the entirety of the academic year.
“It’s a pretty uncomfortable year in the sense that all of this is kept pretty strictly confidential from the candidate so you submit your material and you hear very little,” Edelstein said.
Though the process varies slightly by school, the university has standardized the path of a tenure dossier.
During the departmental review, the first and most important step in the process, the faculty member’s department selects undisclosed external peer reviewers from across the country to review the candidate’s work and write letters regarding the applicant’s contribution to academic discourse. The department also drafts a recommendation letter signed by the department chair or the chair of the faculty for the SFS.
From there, the file heads to the dean of the school, who reads the letters of recommendation, reviews the candidate’s scholarship, service and teaching, and writes his or her own letter for the candidate.
The dossier then makes a brief pit stop at the Office of the Provost to check for completeness before going on to the University Committee on Rank and Tenure, the university-wide 15-member committee that makes decisions about tenure and promotion for faculty across the main, medical and law school campuses.
On the UCRT, each application is assigned to a reviewer of the committee who prepares a presentation for the rest of the committee.
“[The presenter’s report] is followed up by robust discussions,” said Elliott Crooke, chair of the UCRT. “One of the things I think works best about the committee is the confidentiality by which it works, that folks are very comfortable with.”
After the debate, the committee submits its recommendation, and the document returns to O’Donnell, who then writes a letter and sends it to University President John J. DeGioia, who has the final say on all tenure decisions.
Each candidate receives either a letter of acceptance from the president or a denial from the provost in early summer.
Keeping Candidates on Track
O’Donnell said that the university’s high acceptance rate is a reflection of Georgetown’s hiring processes and its mentoring system, which he said keeps expectations realistic.
On the Hilltop, junior faculty members undergo a formal review in their department each year and receive a letter that provides feedback on how they are progressing on their paths.
“Ideally there should be very few surprises come tenure time,” Robert Cumby, who led the Main Campus Executive Faculty Task Force on Rank and Tenure Standards, agreed.
“The probationary period itself and the feedback you get from your department during that time is an essential part of [the tenure] process,” O’Donnell said.
Edelstein agreed that the guidance at Georgetown is a plus.
“Georgetown does a very good job of supporting junior faculty, which makes [the tenure process] a little less anxious,” he said.
According to Cumby, a third-year review process that is more akin to the formal tenure process — in that it goes outside the department to get a preliminary reading on a candidate — will likely go into effect this coming year.
Georgetown also stands out from the pack because it tends to hire candidates that are likely to make tenure, in contrast to a select group of peer institutions like Harvard and Princeton. Many deans on the Hilltop confirmed this culture’s prevalence, saying that those institutions typically tenure very few of their young faculty, instead choosing to hire already-distinguished professors once they have made a name for themselves.
“Every time we hire, we are looking for someone … who will be around for a good long time,” O’Donnell said. “If we go to someone who has just got a Ph.D. … and we ask them to come and start their family life and buy their house here, to do so without a reasonable hope that they can stay around for a good long time I think we could be accused of acting in bad faith.”
Patrick Deneen, a professor of government, was hired with tenure at Georgetown after being denied tenure at Princeton. He attested to the atmosphere of the hiring process there.
“At Princeton, there was a strong expectation that as a junior professor, there was a better than even chance that you would not receive tenure,” he said.
What Does It Take?
Three categories — scholarship, teaching and service — are the guidelines for evaluating every professor who applies. On a broader level, however, the decision is less exact than a mathematical equation.
“The word we tend to use now is trajectory,” O’Donnell said. “Metaphorically, we’re trying to plot the course you’ve been following. … It’s a judgment about the future, which is always uncertain.”
But, he said, the focus is not on the past six years. Instead, it is a reading of whether the candidate will continue to contribute to the Georgetown community.
“It’s not a question of, ‘Has someone done enough to get tenure?'” O’Donnell said.
Within the categories of a tenure decision, scholarship is the most important. Crooke said that the peer reviewers of academic expertise play the biggest role.
“They provide detailed comments as someone in that field, what do they think of this applicant’s scholarship,” he said. Both the comments and the background appraisal from the external evaluator are taken into account.
The committee also heavily weighs the professor’s performance in the classroom, which is judged by teaching evaluations, in-class observation and evaluation of curriculum — depending on the department and school.
A résumé of committees served on and positions held within and outside of Georgetown typically make up the service component.
According to Cumby, service has little weight comparatively, but many administrators said that service is the mark of a team player.
“We want people here who are good citizens of the university,” Dean of the SFS Carol Lancaster said.
