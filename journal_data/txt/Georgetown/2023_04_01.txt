Dr. Anthony Fauci (H ’90), former White House chief medical advisor and former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, came to Georgetown University March 27 and spoke on pandemic control and prevention.
Fauci’s talk, “Pandemic Preparedness and Response: Lessons from COVID-19,” was this year’s Maloy Distinguished Lecture on Global Health, an annual event that features notable public health leaders. Fauci reflected on the strengths and weaknesses of the U.S. response to COVID-19 and proposed public health practices that will better prepare the nation for future pandemics. 
Following introductions from Joanna Lewis, director of the science, technology and international affairs (STIA) program, and Joel Hellman, dean of the Walsh School of Foreign Service, Fauci shared a brief history of the COVID-19 pandemic timeline and some of the lessons he learned while coordinating the United States’ public health response as a member of the White House’s COVID-19 task force.
Fauci said one of the biggest scientific challenges COVID-19 posed was the rapid emergence of new viral variants.
“We were completely unprepared, historically, to have continual waves of viruses of the same broad species that continued to evade immunity,” Fauci said at the event. “Obviously, we now have updated boosters, but we really can’t be playing whack-a-mole for every new variant because we will continue to have new variants.”
Pointing to a graph of COVID-19 cases in the early stages of the pandemic, Fauci emphasized the importance of employing countermeasures early and rapidly when a pandemic begins to emerge.
“When you’re dealing with a pandemic, what you are dealing with today was caused by something that happened two to three weeks ago,” Fauci said. “Pandemics are not linear; they’re exponential.”
According to Fauci, there was immense value in having health care infrastructure such as global data-sharing networks and clinical trial programs already established before the start of the pandemic. He noted that the clinical trial network utilized for the development of an HIV vaccine was rapidly adapted for COVID-19 vaccine research.
“All of the networks that we did clinical trials with HIV, we leveraged them and overnight converted them to what we call the COVID-19 Prevention Network, or COV-PN,” Fauci said. “If we didn’t have that infrastructure that we utilized — that we built 40 years ago — we never would have been able to do this as rapidly and as efficiently as we did.”
He also credits the rapid development of the COVID-19 vaccine to prior scientific advancements, emphasizing the importance of investing further in clinical biomedical research. 
Looking forward to prevention of future outbreaks of other infections, which he says are inevitable, Fauci said using a Prototype Pathogen Approach, in which pathogens are grouped into distinct families and preventative research is conducted on each family to prepare for an outbreak of any pathogen within the family, will allow the public health community to deal with future pandemics proactively instead of reactively. 
“You take classes and families of pathogens and you build on the prior experience with one of the pathogens within a big family,” Fauci said.
Fauci said it is important for scientists to pay attention to the animal-health interface, which he said is becoming increasingly important as zoonotic infectious diseases — those which can transmit from animals to humans like COVID-19 — start becoming more prevalent. Working to preserve tropical and subtropical forests, expanding animal husbandry biosecurity programs and strictly regulating wildlife markets will be critical to reducing the risk of future zoonotic pandemics, according to Fauci. 
Fauci also addressed the role that existing racial and economic inequities played in exacerbating the effects of COVID-19, saying discrimination, limited healthcare access, risk-prone occupations and multigenerational housing increased the likelihood of infection with COVID-19.
“Pandemic emergences put a bright spotlight on the core existing health disparities that are related to the social determinants of health,” Fauci said. 
Fauci closed the lecture by offering insight about how future health leaders can work to prevent pandemics before they begin.
“Our task, and our lesson that we need to learn, is that if we do pay attention to some of the things that I’ve spoken about, that you can prevent an emerging infection from becoming a pandemic,” Fauci said. “Emerging infections are a perpetual challenge, and the only way you address a perpetual challenge is by perpetual preparedness.”

A gunshot was fired at the border of the main campus in a March 25 incident of assault and theft, according to a Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) report.
There were no injuries or damages on the scene of the incident, 3900 Reservoir Road NW, according to the MPD report obtained by The Hoya.
A university spokesperson said neither the victim nor the suspect were affiliated with Georgetown. Brianna Burch, a public affairs specialist for MPD, said MPD has identified the incident to be a domestic issue.
“This is a domestic incident between a male and female who are known to each other,” Burch wrote to The Hoya.
Burch said police identified the suspect as Edward Whren, a resident of the District. While carrying out an emergency search warrant for Whren on March 26, one day after the initial incident, MPD officers heard a gunshot and found Whren suffering from a wound to the head. The officers recovered a firearm next to Whren’s arm and preliminarily concluded that his wound was self-inflicted, according to the official police report obtained by The Hoya. Shortly afterward, DC Fire and Emergency Medical Services arrived and pronounced Whren dead.
The victim told police officers that Whren approached her from behind, holding a handgun to her head and saying “Get in the vehicle or I will kill us both.” During a struggle over the weapon, Whren discharged it, stole the victim’s purse and fled.
Students received a notification of the incident through HOYAlert, the university’s emergency alert system, at 4:53 p.m., about 30 minutes after the gunshot went off. The police report indicates that the incident happened between 4:20 p.m. and 4:23 p.m.
The university spokesperson said the Georgetown University Police Department (GUPD) sent out the HOYAlert as soon as they learned about the incident.
Gabe Gerstel (SFS ’23), who lives about a block from where the gunshot occurred, said he and his roommates benefited from receiving the HOYAlert. 
“I’m definitely very thankful to have gotten the alert because who knows if we would have been a lot closer to the incident at the time,” Gerstel told The Hoya. “I’m glad that they sent that text, especially like in a situation where you might live near where an incident is happening.”
“Upon becoming aware of the incident from MPD, Georgetown University Police Department issued a HOYAlert advising members of the Georgetown community to avoid the area,” the spokesperson wrote to The Hoya. “An ‘all clear’ HOYAlert was sent as soon as it was determined by GUPD and MPD that there was no ongoing threat to the community.”
Gerstel said he did not hear the gunshot and did not observe any police presence, but he and his roommates remained inside their house out of caution for about 20 minutes after receiving the alert. When they saw parents playing with their children in a nearby park, they decided it was safe to go outside again, according to Gerstel. 
Gerstel said he typically feels safe living where he does, though he acknowledged that his identity as a male student might affect this perspective.
“I’m definitely coming from a privileged position of being a guy and living in a house with a bunch of other guys,” Gerstel said. “I don’t have to worry about the same things that a lot of my female and female-presenting friends have to worry about.”
Burch said individuals with information about these incidents should contact MPD by calling 202-727-9099 or by texting 50411.

CW: This article references sexual harassment. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources. 
Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has launched an investigation into John Falcicchio, former chief of staff and deputy mayor for planning and economic development, after sexual harassment allegations were made against him. 
Falcicchio resigned on March 17 without explanation after a D.C. government employee filed a sexual harassment complaint against him. Bowser said in a March 20 press release that she would not provide details on Falcicchio’s departure due to the sensitivity of the matter — but she and her colleagues support the investigation.
“I know you have many questions, but please understand that as this is a sensitive matter that includes privacy concerns, we will not be able to discuss it any further,” Bowser said in the press release. 
“The legal counsel’s office is leading the investigation, following established policies and procedures. I have made it clear that my expectation is that all staff will cooperate fully with this investigation,” Bowser added. 
The employee filing the allegation has hired attorneys Debra Katz and Kayla Morin of Katz Banks Kumin, a law firm specializing in cases of employment, civil rights and whistleblowing. The firm has represented several high profile clients, including Christine Blasey Ford, who testified against Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Katz and Morin issued a response in the hours following the press conference, stating that while they will not reveal their client’s exact identity because of the gravity of the situation, she is a confirmed D.C. government employee.  
“It is our understanding that this behavior is longstanding and our client is cooperating fully with the investigation, which Mayor Bowser initiated immediately,” Katz and Morin said in the March 20 press release. 
“Our client is courageous. She came forward to ensure accountability and protect other women. Given the gravity of our client’s allegations — which involve unwelcome advances and sexual contact — we ask the media to respect her privacy,” Katz and Morin wrote. 
Bowser said the allegations against Falcicchio are not related to the business of her office. 
“I can also tell you that this investigation does not involve any allegations of improprieties related to business transactions. There is no reason for our important work on behalf of the residents of the District of Columbia to slow down,” Bowser said. 
The accusation against Falcicchio signifies the broader issue of sexual harassment in the workplace. 
Working in a setting of large power differentials is one of many risk factors for workplace sexual harassment. 38% of women have experienced sexual harrassment at the workplace. Impacts of harassment include mental health problems, career disruptions and low earnings. 
Soraya Bata (SFS ’24), co-director of advocacy and organizing at H*yas for Choice — a pro-choice, sex-positive, reproductive justice group at Georgetown University — said open conversations on the issue of sexual harassment in workplaces is vital.
“Sexual harassment is a rampant issue in most professional workplaces, and government is no exception,” Bata wrote to The Hoya. “Men in positions of power often feel that they can engage in exploitative conduct and face no consequences, because so often, they do so successfully. This is why it is so important to have frank conversations on sexual harassment: talking about the issue promotes accountability.”
Bata said that sexual harassment, whether in the workplace or otherwise, strips a survivor of their autonomy and sense of self. 
“When anyone, but especially a workplace superior, sexually harasses someone, they are saying to their victim that they don’t have the autonomy to decide how they are treated or regarded in their workplace,” Bata wrote. “The survivor doesn’t get to decide whether they want to be addressed or spoken about in a sexual or intimate manner — the perpetrator makes that decision for them.”

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate’s Finance and Appropriations Committee (FinApp) cut funding for the Media Board and the Performing Arts Advisory Council (PAAC) as part of its student activities budget for the 2024 fiscal year.
The Media Board allocates funding to Georgetown’s student media groups, including publications such as The Hoya, The Georgetown Voice and The Indy, as well as the student radio station WGTB. For the 2023-24 academic year, the Media Board received $85,000 in GUSA funding, a 5.56% decrease in its allocation from the previous fiscal year and only 55.19% of the board’s $154,018 request.
FinApp initially cut the Media Board’s funding to $79,600 during its Feb. 26 deliberation before increasing the Media Board’s allocation to $85,000 after an appeal meeting March 18. 
PAAC received $83,527, a 3.99% decrease in its allocation from the 2023 fiscal year and just 54.7% of the amount the committee requested, $152,690.
The full GUSA Senate confirmed FinApp’s proposed budget in a unanimous 21-0 vote at its March 26 meeting after the committee conferred in its annual budget summit Feb. 25 and 26 and in its appeals session March 18. 
For the 2024 fiscal year, GUSA had $1.201 million in funding to allocate, an increase from the 2023 fiscal year’s total allocation of $1.17 million. Georgetown’s 11 club advisory boards requested a total of approximately $1.54 million in GUSA funding for the upcoming fiscal year.
FinApp Chair GUSA Senator John DiPierri (SFS ’25) said when presenting the committee’s proposed budget that no club advisory board received its full requested funding because of the significant difference between the total funds requested and GUSA’s student activities budget.
“The goal was to fund each board based on demonstrated need,” DiPierri said at the March 26 meeting. “It’s obviously hard to do that when asks are exceeding the amount of money that we have to allocate in such a meaningful way.”
DiPierri said the cuts to the Media Board’s budget stemmed from FinApp’s concerns with the board’s unnecessary spending.
“We had a variety of concerns regarding their allocation of funds, as it pertains to printing contracts,” DiPierri said. “The nature of the WGTB club, we had some concerns over equipment. We had a lot of clarifying questions and decided a large budget cut would be the way to ensure the Media Board comes back, and we can continue our conversation.”
The committee also had concerns about the financial and environmental implications of subsidizing rising printing costs for Georgetown’s print publications, according to FinApp’s final budget report. 
“While we understand and value the importance of print media at Georgetown, there are questions raised regarding whether or not it is financially expedient to continue on a track of accommodating ever-rising printing costs,” GUSA Senator Andrew Wong (SFS ’26), FinApp’s liaison to the Media Board, wrote in the report shared with The Hoya.
“Moreover, the Committee also wishes to see Georgetown’s student publications come up with a plan to meet the 2030 environmental targets set by Georgetown’s Environment and Sustainability Plan,” Wong wrote.
Wong said FinApp plans to create a working group to work with the Media Board in future financial allocation of the Student Activity Fee (SAF), an extra charge each student must pay in addition to their current cost of attendance.
“Student media and publications are extremely important to Georgetown, and I am committed to finding a solution that can both support and grow campus media, while ensuring the Georgetown SAF’s limited funds are being spent smartly,” Wong wrote in an email to The Hoya.
GUSA Senator Rhea Iyer (CAS ’26) opposed the decision to cut the Media Board’s funding to $79,600, considering the Media Board said total print costs for the fiscal year would equal $95,000.
“Our jobs, honestly, at the end of the day, are to evaluate the money that they gave us. And the money that they gave us is the $95,000 for print costs,” Iyer said at the Feb. 26 meeting. “Taking this at face level, they are going to be paying for the full print costs based off of what they said at their presentation. And there’s basically going to be no Media Board as we know it.”
The committee cut PAAC funding after finding that PAAC used around $16,000 of GUSA money to pay students, according to GUSA Senator Saatvik Sunkavalli (SFS ’25), FinApp’s liaison to PAAC.
“Our allocation for PAAC’s budget was informed by a dedication to support campus performances in light of PAAC’s demonstrated increase in membership and quantity of groups,” Sunkavalli wrote in the report. “However, we were concerned with the reveal that PAAC has been allocating money from its student activity funding to pay students, a practice that is highly illegal.”
Seven other advisory boards or organizations — Outdoor Education, Georgetown Program Board, the Advisory Board for Club Sports, the Lecture Fund, the Center for Social Justice Advisory Board for Student Organizations, the Campus Ministry Student Forum and the Student Activities Commission — received more financial allocations than they have in the past. The Transfer Council and Georgetown Opportunities for Leadership Development saw small funding cuts.
DiPierri said he recognizes the effect that every dollar that the committee allocated can have on a student organization. 
“We were really trying to consider the impact of every dollar,” DiPierri said at the meeting. “We’re dealing with thousands of dollars, hundreds of dollars. Little movements between boards and organizations can have a very large, tangible effect on club life. Fifty dollars can impact an event in a very dramatic way.”
