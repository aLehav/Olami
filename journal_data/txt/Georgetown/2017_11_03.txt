Student group Love Saxa is keeping its university funding and recognized status after the Student Activities Commission voted early this morning to recommend no action against the group.
The commission voted 8-4 to reject a complaint filed by student LGBTQ activists Chad Gasman (COL ’20) and Jasmin Ouseph (SFS ’19) on Oct. 22, which alleged Love Saxa fostered “hatred” and “intolerance” by publicly promoting a view of marriage as existing only between one man and one woman.
The vote is not binding — it constitutes a recommendation to Amanda Carlton, the university’s director of student engagement, who is free to accept, amend or reject it.  Her decision can in turn be appealed to Vice President of Student Affairs Todd Olson.
Gasman and Ouseph submitted an appeal of the recommendation to Carlton late Monday night. Carlton declined to comment on whether she would accept the recommendation.
A majority of the 12 voting student members of the commission agreed that the group did not violate any Georgetown University standards by advocating for their traditional view of marriage, which aligns with the position of the Catholic Church. Commissioners deliberated in a private executive session for nearly two hours Thursday night and into early Friday morning, following a hearing Monday that ended after three hours with no vote.
Gasman and Ouseph also cited instances in which Love Saxa invited speakers to campus who spoke against LGBTQ equality, and argued that the club’s purpose is “homophobic” and “dehumanizing” to LGBTQ students. Their petition to SAC asked the university to remove Love Saxa’s university funding and officially recognized status.
Love Saxa receives $250 annually in university funding, and as a recognized student group, it also has access to university resources, such as the use of classrooms for events.
Ouseph said the commission disregarded their substantive arguments against Love Saxa’s purpose and activities.
“I’m both unsurprised but also a little surprised, because the basis of our complaint was pretty firmly rooted in the organization’s standards,” Ouseph said.
Their argument focused on a clause Division of Student Affairs’ Student Organization Standards that states that no student groups are “eligible for access to benefits if their purpose or activities … foster hatred or intolerance of others because of their race, nationality, gender, religion or sexual preference.”
The effort to strip Love Saxa’s funding drew criticism, particularly from religious circles. Fr. James Martin, S.J., a prominent author and advocate for LGBTQ acceptance in the Catholic Church, and Princeton University professor Robert George, a conservative Catholic, condemned the effort in interviews with the Catholic News Agency, an online religious news source.
Love Saxa President Amelia Irvine (COL ’19) said she is glad SAC voted to take no action against the group, but added she regrets the university became involved in the dispute.
“This was not our chosen path of reconciliation. We would rather have worked this out between students rather than have this dramatic political event where there had to be a winner and a loser,” Irvine said. “I hope we can come together in a productive dialogue where we can recognize each other’s humanity.”
The university administration did not explicitly take sides in the dispute before the vote, but Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh said “Love Saxa is one of many groups operating on campus with positions that affirm the teachings of the Catholic Church.”
“Through [SAC], the University supports more than 100 co-curricular student organizations with access to benefits, including Love Saxa,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We strongly support a climate that continues to provide students with new and deeper contexts for engaging with our Catholic tradition and identity.”
“We also support a climate that is welcoming to all students and supporting of our LGBTQ communities,” Pugh wrote.
The dispute started Sept. 25 when the students raised concerns against Love Saxa to Assistant Dean for Student Engagement Erika Cohen-Derr. Following standard practice, Cohen-Derr referred the complaint to SAC, a committee of undergraduate students that operates under the authority of university administrators to allocate funding to student organizations that comply with its standards. SAC allocates about $350,000 to more than 110 student organizations annually, according to its website.
Love Saxa’s constitution states the organization’s mission is “cultivating a proper understanding of sex, gender, marriage, and family” on campus. It also states that the club’s programming — including discussions, lectures and public campaigns — are intended to increase awareness of the benefits of the “primacy of marriage,” “understood as a monogamous and permanent union between a man and a woman.”
The complainants said their action followed the publication of a viewpoint in The Hoya written by Irvine, who wrote that the group’s definition of marriage “does not include same-sex couples, as [Love Saxa members] believe that marriage is a conjugal union on every level — emotional, spiritual, physical and mental — directed toward caring for biological children.”
Love Saxa has had a contentious relationship with LGBTQ student groups on campus since protests in 2013 led by then-GU Pride President Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15). Love Saxa took a yearlong hiatus beginning in spring 2016 after members did not submit a budget to SAC.
At the Monday hearing, Irvine and Love Saxa Vice President Hunter Estes (SFS ’19) countered the complaint, saying the views espoused by Love Saxa are rooted in Catholic and Jesuit tradition and are deeply held religious beliefs for many of the group’s members. They also argued the club’s stance is a political opinion rather than a matter of intolerance.
Irvine and Estes said Love Saxa’s activities include advocacy on a number of other issues and have recently been focused on opposing pornography and the prevalence of a “hookup culture” on college campuses.
Irvine stood by the decision of past Love Saxa leadership in the fall of 2013 to invite to campus Ryan Anderson, a fellow of The Heritage Foundation and an author known for opposing LGBTQ rights. Estes said that the push to strip Love Saxa of its university funding constituted censorship of free speech.
Students opposing Love Saxa pointed to the unrecognized pro-abortion rights student group H*yas for Choice, which regularly hosts events and expresses its views on campus even though it has been denied official recognition by the university.

Students on both the left and right should be thinking: why is some of my Student Activities Fee money going to groups that I politically oppose? Let student groups on both sides do their own fundraising.

I simply do not understand the dilemma with stripping the group of its funding. Nobody is saying that they cannot exist, or cannot continue to espouse their beliefs and hold events (as plenty of unfunded groups continue to do and thus the free speech argument is irrelevant here–H*yas for Choice, Greek Life, even some art/performance groups). The group is free to exist and continue to exist, yet without the support of the tuition dollars of students who feel betrayed and attacked by their views. This is not a Catholicism issue–take for example a hypothetical club that is pro-servitude and pro-slavery, as supported by Noah cursing Ham and his descendants into slavery as per Catholic teaching. Should we have a pro-slavery club, the University would not hesitate to pull its funding–but the students would have the free speech to continue to meet.
Of course, members of Love Saxa are not arguing for indenturing their felllow students, but is the mentality of preaching that their gender is not acceptable, or that their love and marriage is not appropriate or should be recognized, really all that different? Seventy years ago this issue would have been racism justified by the Bible. Today it is homophobia justified by the Bible. Neither should be given University dollars from the people it offends.
I will close my comments by saying that a lot of the work Love Saxa doesn’t I personally support. I am not a Catholic, but rather just a traditionalist, and am all for intervention in the hookup culture and current views of marriage and partnership. But until Love Saxa can join the 21st century and be supportive of all of their students and their definitions of love and marriage, funding should be stripped.

The very fact that the traditional view of marriage should be defended shows that the rot is now complete.

Around 60 members of the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees gathered on Copley Lawn to deliver the letter to DeGioia requesting greater representation in negotiating a new contract.
The letter calls for a formal response from the university by next Wednesday. Rachel Pugh, senior director for strategic communications, said the university is “carefully reviewing their request.
GAGE seeks to “ensure a work environment that lives up to Georgetown’s values as a Catholic and Jesuit university,” according to the letter. GAGE asks Georgetown to uphold its Just Employment Policy, which was adopted in 2005 “to respect the rights of employees to vote for or against union representation without intimidation, unjust pressure, undue delay or hindrance.”
[…] Nov. 1, 2017, we announced that a majority of graduate workers supported the creation of a graduate workers union at […]

Negotiations for a new collective bargaining contract between Georgetown and more than 1,000 adjunct professors concluded Oct. 31 with a final proposal to be voted on by union members, following five months of discussions.
The university presented a final offer Tuesday to the six-person bargaining team, which includes two union staff members, representing the more than 1,000 adjunct professors who teach here. The proposal includes an increase in the minimum compensation adjuncts receive per course taught from $4,700 to $7,000 and the creation of an exploratory committee for a regular part-time position, according to an email sent by the Provost’s Office to main campus faculty Nov. 1.
“I am pleased to report that the union has agreed to present our contract offer to its membership for a ratification vote,” Provost Robert Groves wrote. “We have created a package that increases compensation, rewards longevity, and improves appointment predictability for adjuncts.”
But some adjuncts said they were not satisfied with the proposal because the university’s proposed increase would not affect most adjuncts, who already earn above the minimum rate.
The proposal also states that adjuncts who have been teaching at Georgetown for five years shall receive a flat $250 increase per course in their wages. The university did not agree to provide health care benefits, though it did stipulate the creation of a joint labor management committee to survey adjuncts’ access to health care through other means and the creation of a regular part-time position.
According to adjunct professor of theology Kerry Danner-McDonald (COL ’93), the staff of the union that represents them — Service Employees International Union Local 500 — told adjuncts they were required to vote on the proposal.
Both the union and the university declined to comment on whether all final university proposals must be brought to a vote.
SEIU Local 500 reported the results of negotiations to adjuncts in an Oct. 31 email saying it believed the agreement was “a fair contract.”
“Although we recognize that there are further gains to be made in the future, we believe that this is the best possible settlement we can reach at this time with Georgetown,” the union wrote.
The proposal includes a nearly 50 percent increase in the minimum rate per course in three staggered yearly raises beginning this fall and continuing through fall 2019.
SEIU Local 500 is set to determine a date for a unionwide meeting to discuss the proposal, although it has begun to send voting ballots via mail. If ratified, the contract would enter into effect this fall and last until June 2020.
Given that the university pays most adjunct professors above the minimum rate, adjunct professor Martin Conway said the proposal offered no significant improvements and was unlikely to be ratified. The proposal would receive a “firm ‘no’ recommendation from the adjunct on the team,” Conway said.
The Hoya previously reported the average adjunct earns $7,750 per three-credit course, the highest average rate among local universities, yet trails the earnings of adjuncts at peer universities. At Duke University, for example, the mean rate is $8,207 per course.
Conway said the bargaining team’s efforts will now focus on advocacy and raising awareness for adjunct professors’ situation, including reaching out to student groups such as workers’ rights advocacy group Georgetown Solidarity Committee.
Correction: An earlier version of this article characterized the proposal as a “tentative agreement.” There is no such agreement. Additionally, the email from the Provost’s Office was sent Nov. 1, not Oct. 31.

As an alumnus who in the past has given significant donations to the University I was shocked to read about the adjunct situation. How can a university represent in its fundraising that it is delivering a quality education when the reality is that the courses are designed and delivered by a group of part time, underpaid contract teachers.

Keith Scully says

I am one of the part-time, underpaid, “teachers” referring too. Like to shock you again on a few facts about the Sports Management Graduate program:
1) These part-time  “teachers” are full-time executives and subject matter experts in their field for the subjects taught,
2) all the Adjunct Professors I work with do not teach for the money but to give back, and
3) the challenge is the University lacking any respect and value on the majority of the universities lecturers (that would be the apx. 1,000 adjuncts!).

Adjuncts should quit; just walk away and force universities to either hire them as staff or put the load on existing staff. This is more corporatized multiversity BS! Its disingenuous to offer such absurdly paltry contracts to competent, qualified people where the only difference between them and their ’employed’ colleagues is political. Let DeGioia and the rest of the GU staff take 50-75% pay cuts and use that to pay adjunct staff. They’d still be making many times what faculty makes.  Its obscene and hypocritical  for GU to preach human values and have programs about justice and outreach when they pay such starvation wages. ‘Fess up GU…either practice what you preach, or just shut up, bend over, and keep selling yourself while taking the university to the bottom! BTW….where are the Jesuits in all this? They still live here don’t they? They founded the university didn’t they? Have they just turned belly up, got comfortable in their new home, and forgot what they are?
[…] I recommend that you vote “Yes” on the new union contract with Georgetown. […]

Two education-related tax benefits would be eliminated by a tax bill unveiled by House Republicans yesterday, changes that could make higher education less affordable if the bill passes in its current form.
The bill, which would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, consolidate seven income tax brackets into three and repeal the estate tax by 2024, would reduce federal revenue by $1.51 trillion over the next 10 years and eliminate a number of education-related tax benefits, both of which could reduce affordability of higher education , according to Scott Fleming, associate vice president of federal relations at Georgetown.
The plan would end two tax credits that offset higher education costs for lower- and middle-income students: the Lifetime Learning Credit, worth up to $2,000 per tax return for students enrolled at postsecondary institutions, and the American Opportunity Tax Credit, a refundable credit worth up to $2,500 for tuition and related expenses for the first four years of postsecondary education.
The plan also eliminates interest-based deductions for student loan payments.
The balance of revenue and expenditures set forth by yesterday’s tax bill could jeopardize the future of federal support for higher education. If both the Congressional budget resolutions and tax plans pass, the extra revenue that Republicans project to receive from economic growth may not cover the $1.51 trillion in tax cuts, triggering budget sequestration, Fleming said.
“Sequestration is a provision in the budget law that says if Congress doesn’t pass the laws to conform with the budget resolution, there are across the board cuts that happen in mandatory spending,” Fleming said.
In future academic years, he said, this could result in cuts to Pell Grants, a government subsidy that is considered the foundation of a student’s financial package. These grants, administered by the United States Department of Education, have relied in part on mandatory spending since 1965.
Former Congressman Patrick Murphy (D-Fla.), a fellow at the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service, echoed Fleming’s concerns about the interaction between the budget blueprint and tax reform.
“What they would like to do is be able to say there’s going to be certain amount of GDP growth to offset that, because with this lower tax rate, there will be more GDP growth, and therefore this budget will be more balanced somehow,” Murphy said. “But you can’t have your cake and eat it too. You can’t have a huge tax cut, especially for the top one percent, and help the middle class and then try to slow the deficit and not close the loopholes.”
Fleming explained that the federal government’s impact on affordability of higher education extends beyond direct funding of tuition. The tax bill introduced a 1.4 percent excise tax on net investment income for private universities with assets greater than $100,000 per student.
Georgetown would not be affected by the endowment tax in its current form because the university’s endowment is not large enough to qualify.
However, for qualifying schools, the tax could deplete a key source of funding for financial aid, according to Fleming.
“If endowments are restrained, that could have a negative impact in terms of causing other costs to rise,” Fleming said. “Georgetown puts in many times more institutional aid than our students get in federal financial aid. That’s not true in many schools across the country, but it’s part of our need-blind, full-need policy. That’s where the endowment thing is important—because a lot of our scholarship money is enabled by people giving money.”
Amendments and debate on the tax code will start this Monday, according to an Oct. 26 statement from House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas). Members hope to enact the tax and budget proposals by the end of the year.
President Donald Trump expressed his support for the tax plan in a Nov. 2 press release, saying “I applaud the House Ways and Means Committee for introducing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is another important step toward providing massive tax relief for the American people.”
Murphy said the bill raises the necessity for a broader discussion on federal funding for education.
“With a changing economy, education is critical. We have to have a debate on education—how we train the best and brightest,” Murphy said. “We should be thinking five, 10, 15 years ahead, and you do that by the budget process.”

A proposal to create a Washington, D.C. Office of Nightlife to liaison between the mayor’s office and late night businesses is currently under D.C. Council review
Councilmember Brandon T. Todd (D-Ward 4), joined by Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large) Oct. 3, proposed the new office which would manage business relations between the Executive Office of the Mayor and D.C. businesses operating between the hours of 5:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. A town hall discussion will take place Nov. 8.
The proposed legislation says the office will serve as a point of contact for night businesses to help them connect with District government agencies to address consumer complaints, issues with D.C. agencies and obtaining licenses, permits or approvals.
Todd said the proposed office would encourage business development in neighborhoods like Georgetown.
“As our city is growing by leaps and bounds, neighborhoods that have been devoid of nightlife are suddenly seeing significant development of nightlife in their backyard,” Todd wrote in an email to The Hoya. “However, the growth of nightlife can cause challenges in some communities. For example, in Georgetown, there are safety concerns surrounding the rush of people waiting to catch rides at 2 a.m.”
 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the number of restaurants and bars in Washington has jumped to 2,267 in 2016 from 1,729 in 2006, and the National Restaurant Association reported the food service industry accounted for 63,400 jobs in D.C.in 2017, and is projected to experience 6 percent job growth by 2027.
As nightlife is a rapidly developing sector of D.C.’s economy, the city hopes to encourage further growth with this new office, Todd said.
“With 1,000 people moving into the District every month, and people from throughout the region flocking here for our nightlife, on top of tourists, demand is booming, and this office will help manage the inevitable growth in supply,” Todd said. “An added benefit of the office is that it would help create a long-term economic development vision surrounding nightlife – something that the District is currently lacking.”
Currently, businesses have to contact city agencies during daytime business hours to resolve challenges.
The D.C. Office of Nightlife would be open at night to resolve issues during the business hours of clubs, restaurants and creative industries.
“Currently, businesses need to call specific agencies for specific problem,” Todd said. “It is fragmented and difficult to navigate, especially for small business owners after-hours. Having a centralized point of contact, open at the appropriate hours, would be very helpful for these business owners, as well as neighbors and community leaders.”
Bill McLeod, the executive director of Historic Dupont Circle Main Streets nonprofit, explained the D.C. Office of Nightlife’s potential to ease communication between nightlife businesses and the mayor’s office would simplify problem resolution.
“There should not be a need for the public to file a complaint the next business day. And businesses should be able to deal with any issues almost immediately,” McLeod wrote in an email to The Hoya.
While the proposed office will work to improve communication between the public and the Executive Office of the Mayor, it will not affect the regulation of nightlife.
“This bill does not entail any new regulations,” Todd wrote. “It simply creates an office that serves as an intermediary and liaison between the various stakeholders.”
The proposed legislation would also add a Commission of Nightlife to advise the D.C. director. The commission will be appointed by the mayor.
The proposed Office of Nightlife is not unique to D.C. In European cities such as London, Paris and Zurich, a night mayor or night czar facilitates relations between the government and nightlife businesses. However, the concept is relatively new to the United States. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio approved an Office of Nightlife Sept. 19.
Todd referenced New York’s office in an interview on the Kojo Nnamdi Show Nov. 1.
“New York City just appointed an Office of Nightlife Director this year,” Todd said in the interview. “And I think that we’ll start to see this all over the country, and, frankly, all over the world, especially in big cities like Washington, D.C.”
