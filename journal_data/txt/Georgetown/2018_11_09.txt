A pile of stickers lay on a table in the Healey Family Student Center, reading “friends don’t let friends miss elections” and “civically engaged AF.” Hand-drawn maps, depicting where students voted, either via absentee ballot or in person, surrounded the room. A mock polling station, where students could predict election results, was open throughout the night.
The midterms watch party’s atmosphere in the HFSC on Nov. 6 was marked by such scenes. The Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service hosted the event alongside Georgetown University College Democrats and Georgetown University College Republicans. Accompanying a livestream of CNN’s elections coverage, scattered cheers and sighs of defeat arose from the crowd as results rolled in, from the Democratic sweep of the House of Representatives to the strengthening of Republican control in the Senate and tight gubernatorial races.
Getting Out the Vote
 In an attempt to increase voter turnout, GU Votes, the student-led initiative housed under GU Politics, launched a voter drop box system Sept. 24. The system allowed students to drop their absentee ballot request forms in boxes located in every Residence Hall Office. Boxes were checked nightly by GU Votes volunteers through late October.
The role young adults play in boosting national electoral participation is foundational to GU Votes’ mission. In the 2016 elections, 62.4 percent of Georgetown students voted, according to a 2016 report by the National Study of Learning, Voting and Engagement. About 114 million votes were cast in U.S. House of Representatives races compared to 83 million in 2014, The New York Times estimated.
The increased turnout marks the first time the total number of voters exceeded 100 million in a midterm election, according to GU Votes Co-President Jacqueline Beveridge (SFS ’19). About 31 percent of young people are estimated to have turned out to vote, which is almost double the turnout four years ago, Beveridge said.
Despite high levels of youth participation, delays in the absentee ballot process prevented many Georgetown students from voting.
“I’ve been registered since I turned 18, so that wasn’t an issue, but I actually had to request three different absentee ballots in order to vote,” Georgia native Jack Dobkin (SFS ’20) said. “I ordered my first absentee ballot on September 19, and it was not delivered until my third attempt a week before Election Day, which is just inexplicable to me.”
The results from Georgia’s election still remain too close to call. Although Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp has declared victory, resigning from his position as Georgia secretary of state, Democrat Stacey Abrams’ legal team announced it will take legal action over uncounted votes, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Residents from Dougherty County, among other counties, were allegedly denied the chance to cast their vote by mail.
Georgia’s gubernatorial race between Abrams and Kemp shows a “brokenness of the system,” according to Dobkin.
“Over the past few years, Brian Kemp used his power to disenfranchise thousands of people, especially people of color, in Georgia, and today on Election Day there were all sorts of intimidation and suppressive tactics targeted at people of color,” Dobkin said. “The fact that the end results came out to be the closest statewide race I’ve seen in my time growing up in Georgia shows just how impactful the effect of these restrictive policies are.”
Georgia is not the only state facing allegations of voter suppression. In North Dakota, a court reinstated a law requiring voters to have a residential street addresses, jeopardizing the voting rights of Native American residents, ABC News reported.
Voter suppression is a major point of concern post-election, according to Angela Maske (COL ’19), the president of H*yas for Choice.
“In Georgia, Florida, and North Dakota the clear disregard for voting rights was particularly apparent. These unapologetic moves to restrict voting access in order to retain power for [Donald] Trump and his hard-right allies makes it clear that voting alone will not get our oppressors out of power,” Maske wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We need to recommit ourselves to organizing towards justice, not simply through voting, but also through actively challenging systems of oppression that continue to harm and disenfranchise people all over the country.”
Beyond Partisan Lines
In response to the elections, student groups across campus have looked past the immediate red and blue and are instead focusing on communities affected by the results.
Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) became the first two Muslim women elected to the U.S. Congress. Tlaib is the daughter of Palestinian immigrants, and Omar is a Somali-American refugee, according to CNN.
For Youssef Osman (SFS ’21), the Muslim Students Association’s director of programming, these historic wins give him pride in his Muslim faith and Palestinian heritage.
“The election of two Muslim women in Congress speaks so much to me on a personal level. Rashida Tlaib gives me pride as a Palestinian myself and hope that anything is possible with hard work and commitment to doing justice,” Osman said. “Ilhan Omar has been an inspiration for Muslims around the country, including myself, because she is an individual who has persevered in light of being a refugee and ridiculed for her faith.”
GU Pride was happy to see Massachusetts pass a referendum to maintain nondiscrimination protections for transgender people, Co-President Jenny Xu (COL ’21) said. In the first statewide referendum on trans rights, residents voted to extend a 2016 law, granting further legal protection for transgender people, according to The Hill.
“This matters,” Xu said. “It matters because it means that even though the federal government may try to legislate trans folks out of existence, states can step in to fill the vacuum of common sense in our government. It matters because it means that transgender people in Massachusetts maintain the necessary rights and freedoms they have long deserved. And it matters because the people of Massachusetts are choosing to stand up for their fellow trans citizens.”
Certain election results reflected communities rising against Trump’s divisive rhetoric, according to Maske. During the midterm campaign season, Trump pledged to secure the border against an “invading caravan” of Central American migrants and narrow the definition of gender to male or female at birth, harming the transgender community, according to Reuters.
“Many of these races have also been about challenging the white supremacy, homophobia, transphobia, and sexism propagated by the Trump Administration, and for us that makes them particularly salient,” Maske wrote.
Echoing Maske’s sentiments, Osman said this election separates itself from previous U.S. political races because of the more diverse array of candidates.
“These midterm results mean so much more than any other election. History is being made in the right way as a response to rising Islamophobia and racism,” Osman said. “This is what ‘make America great again’ truly is — where anyone, regardless of race, gender or religion, can become a representative for all those who stand firmly for justice and equality in a free and democratic way.”
Despite Democrats’ gains in the House, Hunter Estes (SFS ’19), GUCR’s membership director in 2016, said certain losses for the party could be an indication of voters’ support for more moderate candidates.
“I think last night was bad for progressives,” Estes wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Whether it be Beto [O’Rourke] in Texas or [Andrew] Gillum in Florida, it seems that voters soundly rejected progressivism in a way that many were not expecting. I think the implications for this are huge, as the dozens of potential Democratic presidential candidates need to take note of the support for moderates and the political center that was shown by 2018 voters.”
GUCR Communications Director Harrison Nugent (SFS ’20) interpreted the national election results as a cautionary tale, calling for Republicans to change their message.
“Democrats taking control of the House should serve as a warning sign to Republicans that the party needs to do a better job of reaching out to young people and African Americans if they hope to regain competitiveness in urban areas and (traditionally Republican) suburban districts,” Nugent wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The rise in political participation and election of candidates from typically underrepresented communities is a positive trend for the future of the U.S. political climate, according to GUCD Chair Maria Cornell (SFS ’20).
“I am hopeful we will see great, meaningful change in the coming years because of the collective organizing and activism we have seen erupt across communities and intersecting identities,” Cornell said.
A healthy future of the United States requires bipartisan efforts and voter turnout, according to GUCR President Jake Lyons (COL ’20).
“We’re an imperfect union that’s been moving toward a more perfect one – and elections like these are our part in that process,” Lyons wrote in an email to The Hoya.

Hundreds of Georgetown University graduate student workers voted this week on whether the university will recognize the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees as a union, allowing it to engage in collective bargaining with the university.
Results are set to be announced Friday morning: Official counting begins at 9 a.m. in New North 204.
Over 400 graduate students had voted by the time polls closed Wednesday evening, according to a spokesperson for the university. Approximately 1,100 graduate students were eligible to vote.  Official estimates after the polls closed Thursday were not available as of press time.
The American Arbitration Association, a neutral third-party organization, moderated the election, which began Nov. 5 and ended on the evening of Nov. 8. GAGE filed for election with the AAA on Oct. 8, after a yearlong push to receive official recognition from the university as a union.
GAGE is affiliated with the American Federation of Teachers, a national union that represents 1.7 million members from over 3,000 affiliates. If a majority of the students who vote support unionization, GAGE and AFT will become the sole collective bargaining agents for all graduate students at the university.
GAGE would then be able to negotiate stipend amounts, wage rates, benefits, hours and similar matters for graduate student workers, according to the April 2 agreement between GAGE and the university.
All graduate research assistants, as well as graduate teaching assistants and doctoral teaching associates, were eligible to vote in the election. Graduate students were able to vote at four polling locations in Regents Hall, the Intercultural Center, Lauinger Library and the Preclinical Science Building.
Polling stations remained open from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. throughout the four days of voting, and poll observers from GAGE were present to help ensure fairness, according to Sarah Fisher, a GAGE member and third-year doctoral candidate who works in the government department.
Douglas McRae, a fifth-year doctoral candidate and history department employee who is a member of GAGE, said he was happy to see his peers share similar enthusiasm for the election and for GAGE’s cause.
“Frankly, the past few days have been very exciting — you know, it’s been a long voting time frame, and it’s been just exciting seeing people turn out to vote, seeing people being able to have a say into whether we should form a union or not, and it’s also exciting to see our members turn out,” McRae said. “It’s the culmination of a huge effort, so we’re waiting in anticipation to see the results tomorrow.”
Charlotte Xing (GRD ’19) was happy to have voted in the election and supported the union as she left the polls Thursday afternoon.
“I think it’s quite important to have a union to represent student labor,” Xing said. “I’m excited to be a part of this, and it’s been a pleasure.”
Deidre Nelms, a third-year doctoral candidate and philosophy department employee who is also a member of GAGE, was pleased to see how many people had voted so far.
“It was so exciting to see a huge number of my colleagues come out to vote yes and hold each other accountable for voting this week,” Nelms wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The university remained neutral throughout the election and encouraged all eligible students to vote, regardless of their view on unionization.
“At Georgetown, we’re committed to ensuring that members of our community have a voice in their experience,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We value our graduate students, who are an important part of our academic community. Georgetown is committed to continuing to enhance the resources provided to graduate students.”
GAGE began to pressure the university for the ability to form a union in November 2017.
The university first considered allowing the AAA to oversee a potential vote on whether to grant official recognition to GAGE in January 2018 after receiving a proposal from GAGE and the AFT.
Provost Robert Groves wrote in a Jan. 9 email that the university would accept an election moderated by the AAA rather than the National Labor Relations Board, which usually oversees union elections in the United States, because of the NLRB’s current categorization of graduate teaching assistants as university employees.
The university initially declined to recognize GAGE as a union because it considers graduate student workers primarily as students, not as employees.
This sentiment has been voiced by multiple prominent U.S. universities as they reflect on their relationships with their student workers.
Brown University Provost Richard Locke also expressed this view in an email to Brown’s student body.
Stand Up for Graduate Student Employees, Brown’s would-be union for its graduate student workers pending a formal vote, also filed for election with the AAA, rather than the NLRB, according to an Oct. 11 AFT news release. Its election is set to begin Nov. 14 and conclude Nov. 16.
AFT President Randi Weingarten praised Georgetown for its willingness to find alternative means to cooperate with its graduate student workers in the Oct. 11 news release.
“Both schools are on the road of long-lasting partnership with the employees who conduct the research, teach the classes and grade the papers that make their schools run, and we trust their commitment to democracy will not falter as the elections draw near,” Weingarten said.
Several universities have also recently sought private recognition as unions from their universities, rather than through the NLRB.
Graduate student worker unions from both the University of Chicago and Yale University withdrew their recognition petitions in February 2018 out of fear of a possible overturn of the 2016 NLRB ruling that classified graduate student workers as employees of the university. With a private agreement directly with the universities, unions will retain recognition even if the 2016 ruling were overturned, according to a spokesperson from Georgetown.
Though the university has upheld its promise to hold the election, students should not forget the effort it took to get to this point, according to workers’ rights advocacy group Georgetown Solidarity Committee member Logan Arkema (COL ’20).
“At the end of the day, graduate workers wouldn’t be in a position to have a voice in their working conditions if they didn’t stand up and demand that,” Arkema said. “At the end of the day, the university is only going to take extra steps to make this institution a better place for all of us if we stand up and fight for it.”

Students are pushing for expediency and greater input into a newly formed working group evaluating honorary degrees, including those held by cardinals implicated in the sexual abuse crisis, as it met the first time this week.
The launch of the working group comes after student concerns about honorary degrees held by the cardinals. On Nov. 2, Georgetown University Vice President Joseph Ferrara informed five students from Catholic-affiliated student groups that they would be able to voice their concerns to the working group, according to Grace Laria (SFS ’19), who was present at the meeting. Laria co-authored a petition in September urging the honorary degree revocation of former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick and Cardinal Donald Wuerl. (Full disclosure: Laria is a former member of The Hoya’s editorial board.)
However, students said the university fails to adequately communicate the status of the honorary degrees to students. In the meeting with Ferrara, students also asked for students to be placed on the working group.
The working group is set to meet this week, according to university spokesperson Matt Hill.
The same five students from Catholic-affiliated student groups met with Ferrara and Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Mark Bosco, S.J., on Oct. 17.
Ferrara informed the students of the creation of an ad hoc working group at the board of directors’ standard fall meeting to examine the issue of honorary degrees broadly and to reconsider those given to McCarrick and Wuerl.
Catholic retreat leader Julie Bevilacqua (COL ’19) was one of five students in the meeting and urged for greater transparency from the university.
“We wanted more transparency from the university; we wanted more information about what was happening — why action hadn’t been taken yet — just kind of what was going [on] administratively, because I think that hasn’t been made clear to the student body,” Bevilacqua said in an interview with The Hoya.
The four-person working group composed of members of the board of directors in October was launched in response to ongoing calls to revoke the honorary degrees of McCarrick and Wuerl, both former archbishops of Washington, D.C., to examine honorary degrees in general.
McCarrick was suspended from public ministry in June after the Archdiocese of New York deemed an allegation of sexual abuse from a teenage altar boy “credible,” resulting in additional allegations of sexual abuse and disclosures of settlements with adult accusers. McCarrick resigned from the College of Cardinals in July.
Wuerl was implicated in misconduct after a Pennsylvania grand jury report in August said he mishandled accusations of sexual abuse as bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh. Wuerl resigned as Archbishop of Washington on Oct. 12 but has defended his record on protecting survivors of sexual abuse. Wuerl remains in the College of Cardinals and still holds his position as the interim apostolic administrator of the District.
A university spokesperson confirmed the working group is composed of four members but did not elaborate further.
“The working group, comprised of four members of the Board of Directors, will be meeting this week to consider all aspects of the honorary degree process,” university spokesperson Matt Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Students who have been engaged on the topic of honorary degrees will be invited to join the working group for a discussion. After conferring, the working group will make recommendations to the board’s executive committee.”
The effort to revoke the degrees began as early as August, when Catholic Women at Georgetown President Erica Lizza (COL ’19) contacted the office of University President John J. DeGioia to request that the university revoke McCarrick’s degree amid allegations. (Full disclosure: Lizza is a current member of The Hoya’s editorial board.)
In September, Austin Rose (COL ’18, LAW ’21), Max Rosner (COL ’18), Tomás Álvarez Belón (SFS ’18) and Laria shared a petition asking the university to call for Wuerl’s resignation and revoke McCarrick’s and Wuerl’s honorary degrees. McCarrick received an honorary degree from the university in 2014 and Wuerl received a degree in 2015. The petition, which has now garnered over 1,500 signatures, was delivered to DeGioia’s office Sept. 14.
In a meeting about the petition with Ferrara later that month, the students who crafted the petition reiterated the demands and spoke about the personal importance of the issue to them, according to interviews with The Hoya with students who attended.
Georgetown University has a responsibility as a Catholic institution to be a leader in protecting survivors of sexual abuse, Bevilacqua said.
“I think for as much conversation and dialogues we have about this crisis in the Catholic Church, I’m still aware in the back of my mind that action needs to be taken for us to move forward,” Bevilacqua said. “Because I think before we’re able to take that step, it’s going to be an obstacle to the type of healing we need in the community.”
Numerous institutions revoked honorary degrees given to McCarrick, including Fordham University and the University of Portland, but none have revoked degrees given to Wuerl.
The Catholic University of America revoked its honorary degree to McCarrick in late July. It was the first time CUA has ever revoked an honorary degree.
“The entire Catholic University community acknowledges the tragedy of sexual abuse at the hands of clergy, and the deep and lasting pain and suffering of survivors,” CUA said in a statement.
CUA has not revoked Wuerl’s honorary degree, and he remains chancellor of CUA, according to The Tower, CUA’s independent student newspaper.
Notre Dame University decided against revoking the honorary degree granted to McCarrick, saying it would wait for the conclusion of the canonical trial by the Vatican. The decision was consistent with the university’s tradition of waiting for the conclusion of trials before deciding whether to withdraw an honorary degree, according to the university.
“While the allegations in this case are most grave, as they were in the case of Bill Cosby, we believe it respects not only the rights of those involved but also the adjudicatory process itself to allow that process to reach a conclusion before taking action,” the university said in a statement.
Bevilacqua described Wuerl’s and McCarrick’s honorary degrees as “an obstacle to the type of healing we need” to move forward on the sexual abuse scandal that is roiling the Catholic community.
“Because of my engagement, because I know what this community has meant to me, I want to see it be better and improve and live out all the things it says to live out,” Bevilacqua said. “I think when you love something, you want it to be better.”
This post has been updated at 6:26 p.m. on Nov. 11 to reflect Austin Rose’s (COL ’18, LAW ’21) role in the creation of a petition to revoke McCarrick and Wuerl’s honorary degrees.

Incumbents picked up wins across major races in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia on Tuesday, with Mayor Muriel Bowser (D), Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) winning re-election.
Georgetown faculty, students and alumni also won races across the city and country, including Matias Burdman (COL ’21) and Anna Landre (SFS ’21), who both won uncontested seats for the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, and Georgetown professor Emily Gasoi, who won the election to represent Ward 1 on the D.C. State Board of Education.
The results come as the Democratic Party gained control of the U.S. House of Representatives, while the Republican Party maintained control of the U.S. Senate on Tuesday night.
The only one of three Georgetown alumni senators up for re-election this year, Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) (CAS ’74, GRD ’78) was elected for another term, according to The New York Times.
Alumni Del. Stacey Plasket (D-U.S. Virgin Islands) (SFS ’88), Lori Trahan (SFS ’95), Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) (CAS ’86), Jim Maxwell (CAS ’71), Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) (CAS ’75), Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) (SFS ’78), Rep. Filemon Vela (D-Texas) (CAS ’85), Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.) (CAS ’75, LAW ’78) and adjunct professor Lauren Underwood all won elections to the House of Representatives.
Recent alumnus and Democratic candidate Will Haskell (COL ’18) won his race for Connecticut’s 26th District in the Connecticut State Senate, according to The Connecticut Mirror. The Obama-endorsed, 22-year-old candidate defeated Republican incumbent and 22-year veteran of the state legislature Toni Boucher.
Bowser became the first D.C. mayor to win re-election since 2002, with an unprecedented 43.15 percent voter turnout, one of the highest turnouts ever for a midterm election in the District since 2002, according to the United States Election Project. Bowser received 76.18 percent of the vote, ahead of second-place Green Party candidate Ann Wilcox, who received 9.4 percent.
“Together with all of our neighbors, whether you have been here for five generations like us, or five minutes, I am your mayor,” Bowser said in her election night speech. “We’re going to get it done together.”
Despite Bowser’s endorsement of third-generation Washingtonian and restaurant owner Dionne Reeder, an independent, incumbent Councilmember Elissa Silverman (I-At Large) won a second term as one of the D.C. Council’s at-large members. Silverman has received backlash for supporting a paid family medical leave law that Reeder and Bowser argue is a burden to businesses, according to The Washington Post.
Silverman defeated Reeder by a 12.2 percent margin for one of the two at-large seats on the D.C. Council. Incumbent Councilmember Anita Bonds (D-At Large) picked up the second at-large seat.
In addition to Silverman and Bonds, all D.C. Council incumbents secured victories in elections for the D.C. Council, according to the D.C. Board of Elections.
Phil Mendelson (D) was re-elected as D.C. Council chairman with 89.1 percent of the vote. Councilmembers Brianne Nadeau (D-Ward 1), Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3), Kenyan McDuffie (D-Ward 5) and Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) all won re-election with over 70 percent of the vote in each of their respective wards.
Despite trailing behind alumnus Jason Andrean (MSB ’05) in terms of funds raised, Georgetown University education, inquiry and justice professor Emily Gasoi defeated Andrean to serve on the D.C. Board of Education. Andrean raised the most of any candidate in the race with over $65,000 as of October, according to WAMU. Incumbent Ruth Wattenberg retained her seat as the Ward 3 Board of Education member, Zachary Parker won Ward 5, and Jessica Sutter won Ward 6.
Gasoi attributed her victory to her stance on education issues and her background as a professional educator and parent of a child in D.C. Public Schools.
“I think the issues that differentiated me from my opponents were the ones that really resonated with Ward 1 voters: they are interested in protecting and strengthening our by-right neighborhood schools, shifting away from over-emphasis on student test scores, especially as a measure for school quality, and in having a more transparent and responsive school system,” Gasoi wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Democrat Ben Jealous’ campaign to unseat Republican Hogan as Maryland governor failed, with Hogan winning all but three counties in the state, according to The Baltimore Sun. Historically liberal voting districts Baltimore City, Prince George’s County and Montgomery County voted for Jealous, but Hogan took 56.4 percent of the vote across the state.
Hogan ran on a pro-business campaign emphasizing his record on bipartisanship. As the second Republican governor to be re-elected in the history of Maryland, Hogan emphasized his efforts to work with Democrats in his victory speech.
“Tonight in this deep blue state, in this blue year, with a blue wave, it turns out I can surf,” Hogan said at his post-election celebration, according to the Baltimore Sun.
In Virginia, Kaine defeated Republican Corey Stewart (SFS ’91) to win his second term in the Senate. Kaine, former governor of Virginia and Hillary Clinton’s running mate in 2016, outraised Stewart, an ally of President Donald Trump.
Back in Georgetown, Burdman said that he and Landre celebrated their victory and aim to bring the perspective of Georgetown University students to the ANC.
“By working to improve some of the most fundamental components of our student experience, such as transportation, accessibility, safety, and campus planning, we aim to make our campus—and the greater neighborhood—better and more equitable for all of our students,” Burdman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In short, we want to continue to make our campus nicer and we want ensure that people can get around easily; both within the university and to and from the greater city.”

The Georgetown Sexual Assault and Misconduct Advisory Committee announced Nov. 2 the development of a Coordinated Community Response Team to focus on prevention and addressing the needs of survivors of sexual misconduct.
The team’s formation is part of an update on the committee’s response to recommendations from the Sexual Assault and Misconduct Task Force.
The CCRT will include experts and leaders from the community and faculty, staff and students, according to SAMAC Co-Chairs Vince WinklerPrins, assistant vice president for student health, and Jennifer Woolard, associate professor of psychology. The team will focus on developing responses to sexual assault, sexual misconduct, harassment, stalking and interpersonal violence, particularly for those individuals from vulnerable populations.
The creation of the CCRT was one of 11 recommendations introduced by the Sexual Assault and Misconduct Task Force, a team established by President John J. DeGioia in response to the results of Georgetown’s inaugural Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey in Jan. 2016, which reported that of the respondents of the survey, one in three women had experienced sexual assault.
Kory Stuer (COL ’19), Avery Moje (COL ’19), Daria Crawford (COL ’20), Andy Turner (SFS ’20) and Susu Zhao (COL ’19) released an open letter to Rosemary Kilkenny, Todd Olson and Vince WinklerPrins on Aug. 31, regarding the lack of any updates about what progress SAMAC has made since the Climate Survey.
The students then met with Vice President of Institutional Diversity and Equity Rosemary Kilkenny, Olson and WinklerPrins on Sep. 20 and received a number of commitments, including to provide an update on SAMAC’s progress, according to Moje. The email sent Nov. 2 to the university community was the first response to the students’ demands, Moje said.
“The update that was released last Friday was the first time we saw a school-wide update released in response to our asks that we made in August and September,” Moje wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The university would not have updated the campus on developments in response to the recommendations from the task force had they not received pressure from students, Stuer said.
“Although this update was really helpful in a lot of ways, this was something that happened as a direct result of students asking for it,” Stuer said. “This was not something the university just gave to the campus.”
Following the Sept. 20 meeting, Stuer and Moje formed Students Taking Action against Interpersonal Violence, a student group formed  to pressure the university to increase its transparency in responding to the recommendations from the task force.
The group is concerned about the lack of timelines to hold the university accountable, Stuer said.
“Students need to know what concrete steps have been taken,” Stuer said. “There needs to be a place where they can find out that information.”
Students cannot hold SAMAC accountable if it does not regularly provide updates on its actions, Moje wrote.
“The University must also be setting accountability measures for itself and part of creating transparency with students is allowing students to hold the University to a certain standard, which includes implementing these recommendations on a reasonable timeline,” according to Moje.
The task force recommended that the CCRT begin working in the fall of 2017, but SAMAC’s recent update did not include a time frame for when the response team will be operational. Relevant administrators informed him that the team would be functional in the fall of 2019, Stuer said.
While this update was a step in the right direction, there still remains a lack of transparency in Georgetown’s sexual assault response and prevention policy, according to Moje.
“Even those of us students who work closely on sexual assault policy at Georgetown don’t really know what progress has been made,” Moje wrote.
Georgetown needs greater transparency surrounding Title IX resources and processes, Stuer said. The university currently employs an interim Title IX Coordinator, after the first full-time Title IX Coordinator, Laura Cutway, left her role in late June.
“They still haven’t told the student body that we have had a change in personnel around who is our Title IX coordinator. We don’t have a full-time Title IX coordinator. I don’t know how they can in good faith say they’re increasing transparency around Title IX when they haven’t even told the student body there’s been changes in who’s running it,” Stuer said. “If you ask 100 Georgetown students what the Title IX process is at Georgetown, 100 of them will tell you that they don’t know.”
As part of the university’s ongoing efforts to respond to recommendations from the task force, the university is finalizing plans to launch a second sexual misconduct campus climate survey in February 2019, according to Kilkenny.
“The university is also finalizing plans to launch our second sexual misconduct campus climate survey in February 2019,” according to Kilkenny. “Undergraduate, graduate and professional students will be invited to participate so that the university can learn important information about the nature and prevalence of campus sexual assault and misconduct.”
SAMAC recognized that there is still progress to be made and that its efforts are not finished, but they are committed to responding to recommendations from the task force.
“While SAMAC has made significant progress, our work is not finished,” SAMAC said in their email to the Georgetown community.
This story was updated at 5:03 p.m. on Nov. 9, 2018 to reflect Rosemary Kilkenny’s full title and to clarify details on the CCRT and the status of the university’s Title IX coordinator.

The U.S. criminal justice system protects wealthy white men, rapper Meek Mill said at an event Wednesday night in Lohrfink Auditorium.
Mill, a Philadelphia native, was first arrested in 2007 for possession of drugs and an unlicensed firearm, and was sentenced to prison two years later. Mill was released on good behavior in 2009 after eight months in prison. Mill later violated his probation multiple times, causing him to be sent back to prison in 2014.
He was arrested twice in 2017, once for getting into a fistfight in an airport and later for a video that showed him doing stunts on a dirt bike in New York City. A Philadelphia judge sent Mill back to prison in 2017. He was released this year when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered that he be granted bail after serving five months of his two- to four-year sentence.
Mill brought national attention in the spring to the criminal justice movement as the focus of the #FreeMeekMill movement, an effort by Meek Mill fans to draw attention to what they saw as Mill’s unfair imprisonment. At Wednesday’s event, Mill discussed prison and criminal justice reform with Professor Marc Howard, the founding director of Georgetown’s Prisons and Justice Initiative.
The criminal justice system works in favor of wealthy, white men, Mill said, referencing a conversation he had with Patriots owner Robert Kraft.
“I was sitting in the studio with Robert Kraft the other day and I said, ‘You’re an old, rich, white, wealthy man,’” Mill said. “‘If you called the police right now and say I punched you in the face, and when they get here and I say, ‘No, he punched me in my face,’ what do you think is gonna happen? I’m gonna go to jail.’”
Mill’s childhood in South Philadelphia, where he witnessed violence and crime, made his interactions with the criminal justice system inevitable, he said.
“People were selling drugs on my doorstep. People were shooting on each corner of my neighborhood. Prostitutes all over my neighborhood and coming out and seeing that on a daily basis as a child. That’s all I know,” Mill said. “So you know, it’s like I’m on a hundred mile an hour race to meet the penitentiary.”
A police officer who testified at Mill’s trial accused the rapper of assault because the officer’s hand broke when he punched Mill in the face, according to Mill.
“Actually, a cop came and testified,” Mill said. “I think he said that his hand got fractured and that I fractured his hand. They actually charged me with assault for his hand being fractured when his hand was fractured because he punched me in my face.”
The environment in which he grew up was a decisive factor in his later incarceration, according to Mill.
“I probably would have gotten killed or went to jail because I was destined,” he said. “That’s what my neighborhood was about.”
Mill chose to carry a firearm without a license for self-protection when he was a teenager, leading to his imprisonment in 2009, he said.
“At the age of 18, I chose to start carrying a firearm, I wasn’t old enough to get my firearm license and people was just dying in my neighborhood on a daily basis,” Mill said. “That’s just what it was and I made the decision that I would want to try and protect myself if I ever encounter that type of situation.”
Mill started selling drugs to pay for a lawyer better than the public defender the government would have provided him with.
“I didn’t have a public defender. Actually, I had to actually turn to selling drugs, to actually do what they said I was doing,” Mill said. “I turned to start selling marijuana because I knew if I went to prison with a public defender, I would probably lose my freedom for sure, for 100 percent sure.”
Judges and police officers should be evaluated on regular basis, according to Mill.
“Judges should be evaluated. Police officers should be mentally evaluated. Anybody that has authority over the next person’s life should be evaluated at least on a six-month basis.”
Tuesday’s midterms elections were good for candidates that support criminal justice reform, especially in his home state of Pennsylvania, Mill said in an interview with The Hoya.
“You’re seeing a lot of people that supported reform’s numbers went up,” Mill said. “In Pennsylvania, our governor, he ran his campaign off of reform and reform was a major topic in his campaign and I think it will continue to grow stronger and stronger. America has never been in this season of reform as much as it is and I think it will continue to have an effect on all politics.”

The Georgetown University Student Association senate is considering a resolution calling on the university to erect a memorial honoring the 272 slaves sold in 1838 by the Maryland Society of Jesus and to take up the recommendations proposed by the Working Group on Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation.
Senator Sam Appel (COL ’20) drafted the proposal, titled “A Resolution Calling For Georgetown To Transform Its Legacy.” The resolution contextualizes Georgetown’s recent attempts to acknowledge its historical dependence on slavery.
The resolution concludes by urging Georgetown’s administration to execute more of the suggestions provided in the Working Group’s 2016 report. Georgetown completed one recommendation when it announced in Sept. 2016 that the university would offer legacy preference in admissions to descendants of the 272 slaves who applied to the university. In addition, in April 2017, the university released a public apology for the sale of the 272 slaves and renamed two on-campus buildings to honor two of the formerly enslaved peoples.
The proposal specifies three key steps for the university: creating an on-campus memorial in concert with the recognition of slavery-related historical sites, launching an oral history initiative to preserve accounts of the descendants of the 272 slaves and funding scholarships named for former Georgetown slaves that promote racial equality.
Appel said that the university’s rejection of Fax Victor’s (COL ’19) offer to design, build and fund a small on-campus memorial honoring the 272 slaves was what spurred him to write the resolution.
Victor, who helped Appel draft the resolution, has experience in illuminated tombstone design. He was inspired by reading the report of the working group, which devoted an entire committee to the issue of memorialization at Georgetown. Victor designed a model of a small memorial and offered to finance its supplies and construction. He said he met with university officials, asking for a concrete platform and the necessary space outside Arrupe Hall, which is located on the former site of a segregated graveyard. Part of a femur was found during Arrupe’s construction in 2014.
University officials told Victor they supported the idea, but had to engage in discussions with other groups, such as the Society of Jesus and the descendants of the 272 slaves, according to Victor. Memorialization efforts have lost their momentum in the past few years, and Victor worries that future students will be unaware of slavery’s legacy at Georgetown.
“I absolutely feel that progress has stalled since the working group finished, but there’s more to be done,” he said. “I love Georgetown, and I love the tenets that we pride ourself [sic] on, but we have to practice what we preach.”
The university is actively working to make sure it properly addresses and atones for its history with slavery, university spokesperson Meghan Dubyak wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“The Descendant Community, the Society of Jesus, and Georgetown are engaged in a dialogue with the goal of reconciliation and transformation regarding the legacy of slavery,” Dubyak wrote. “The process is anchored in the practice of trust-building, truth-telling, racial healing, and transformation.”
The university welcomes open dialogue with GUSA and with the broader student body in its efforts to confront the terrible legacy of slavery, both in its own history and nationally, according to Dubyak.
“We believe that this kind of collaborative approach is the best path toward reconciliation and responding to the challenges of racial injustice today,” she said.
Appel, who began writing the resolution on Tuesday, had not formally submitted it for introduction as of Thursday, according to senate Speaker Eliza Lafferty (COL ’21) in a message to The Hoya. Senate bylaws require that a resolution be referred to the Speaker by 5 p.m. on Friday in order to be debated at the weekly Sunday senate meeting.
Appel intends to submit the resolution before the deadline, but is waiting in order to gain as many signatures in support from students as possible, he said. The resolution had 201 signatures at time of publication. Appel remains optimistic about the resolution’s chances of enactment.
“I think the senate will approve this resolution. We definitely have senators who are passionate on this issue and will push for it,” Appel said. “I think the GUSA executive will also absolutely be behind us.”
Other activists welcomed the resolution, but cautioned that it was only a first step toward increasing pressure on the university, due to GUSA’s limited power. Hannah Michael (SFS ’21), who helped Appel draft the resolution, said memorialization is only one of many initiatives recommended by the working group.
“Passing the resolution is meant to be symbolic. Ideally, the university would see that students care and be compelled to act on that,” Michael said. “But the resolution is only the bare bones of what absolutely must happen. We don’t want the dialogue to end with the resolution being passed.”
This story was updated at 4:53 p.m. on Nov. 9 to clarify certain details on the university’s steps towards addressing the suggestions from the working group. A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that several human remains were found during Arrupe’s construction, but a part of a femur was found.

A new vice president for facilities management and planning will take over the role in December, the university announced in a news release Nov. 2.
Benjamin Kuo, currently an associate vice president for facilities management at Cornell University, will replace interim Vice President for Facilities Management and Planning Gregory Simmons. The previous VP, Robin Morey, took an executive role at Emory University in July.
Kuo will guide the university’s master plan for Georgetown’s campus as vice president for planning and facilities management. He is also set to oversee the university’s maintenance and sustainability initiatives as well as its construction projects, transportation services and day to day operations, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Geoff Chatas wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Kuo previously worked as Cornell’s environmental health and safety director for continuity, emergency and fire management and as its interim director for transportation services, according to Chatas. In this capacity, Kuo worked to transform the university’s emergency management response with a grant from the U.S. Department of Education. Before his time at Cornell, Kuo worked corporate and engineering roles at Toyota.
Kuo said his prior experience both at Cornell and with Toyota would help him focus on innovative aspects of facilities, which will improve the quality of university life for both students and staff.
“In addition to my experience at Cornell University, my background with Toyota has helped me to bring a sense of innovative problem solving and consensus building to the teams that I’ve led,” Kuo wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Higher education institutions must balance fiscal responsibility with ensuring that our existing facilities (including our green spaces) have the appropriate stewardship while achieving future-forward aspirations of student life, teaching, and research.”
Kuo’s breadth of relevant experience will make him a good fit for the job, according to Chatas.
“He will be a great partner as we strive to deepen engagement with our neighbors and the District of Columbia and plan responsibly in ways that strengthen both our university and our impact within Washington,” Chatas wrote in the news release.
Kuo hopes to create a tight-knit community within the department, focusing on a commitment to the university’s well-being. He plans on reaching out to the community to understand the areas of improvement that his team will be tackling.
“Although I will lead a large department, I hope to foster a tight-knit team, instill a sense of dedication and service towards the campus community, and strive for continued improvements,” Kuo wrote. “We will be reaching out to various stakeholders across the campus community to understand their aspirations as well as learn about opportunities for us to improve in order to develop shared expectations moving forward.”
Kuo lived in Arlington, Va., in the early 1990s after he graduated from Carnegie Mellon University and, as a former resident of the area, Kuo said he is amazed by the progress the area has made and looks forward to contributing to the continued improvement of the neighborhood.
“It’s amazed me how different the District is decades later from when I lived here, and I’m excited to be a part of Georgetown and the District’s continued future development as part of the Georgetown University Campus Plan (2017-2036) that was recently approved,” Kuo wrote. “Georgetown is a world-class institution with a vibrant university community and historic campus … I look forward to coming full circle and having my family call this area home.”

The Georgetown University Student Association senate amended the bylaws for the Ethics and Oversight Committee, which launched last month, to require more training in student health and misconduct topics after executive resignations earlier this semester.
The GUSA senate established the Ethics and Oversight Committee last month after the resignation of former GUSA President Sahil Nair (SFS ’19), Vice President Naba Rahman (SFS ’19), Chief of Staff Aaron Bennett (COL ’19) and 10 other executive members. The committee’s original responsibilities included monitoring senators’ attendance at meetings, investigating conflicts of interest and tracking the senate’s finances. The committee retains the power to begin impeachment processes.
The amendment requires voting members of the Ethics and Oversight Committee to receive training from student groups in topics such as the mental and physical health of students, sexual misconduct and general student safety within a month of joining the committee. The committee is also responsible for providing resources to students in cases concerning student health and safety.
Under the new amendment, committee members are now also ineligible to actively participate in, endorse or associate themselves with any GUSA executive campaign.
The bylaw changes were a joint endeavor between the GUSA executive and legislative branches, according to GUSA press secretary Jonathon Marek.
“The Executive worked closely with the Senate to ensure that this legislation will provide an improvement in GUSA transparency, which is a priority for this administration given the events of earlier this year,” Marek wrote in a message to The Hoya.
The committee is chaired by GUSA senator Dylan Hughes (COL ’19), who has said previously that the committee was created independently of Nair’s resignation.
The new prohibition on committee members’ active engagement in GUSA Executive campaigns will increase the accountability of GUSA’s leadership and improve the Senate’s overall transparency, according to Hughes.
“These are all pretty good changes, they were brought up somewhat unorthodoxly, but that doesn’t change the substance themselves,” Hughes said at Sunday’s senate meeting, when the bylaws. “After having worked through it over the past couple of weeks as a whole body, as a whole working group, I’m confident in always looking to improve this particular committee as well as the whole senate.”
The GUSA senate also passed two resolutions during the Sunday meeting.
The first resolution expressed solidarity for the Jewish community at Georgetown after the Oct. 27 Tree of Life Synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh.
“This has been something that has been really tough for a lot of Jews on campus to go through, it hits close to home for a lot of people. There’s been a lot of conversation on how to move forward, how to support the community,” Senator Lexie Gutierrez (COL ’20) said at the meeting. “We’re showing people that we’re here, we care and we’re listening, and we’re supportive.”
The second resolution supports a petition to extend the university’s faculty parental leave policy to full time nontenure-line faculty. The petition, put forth by the Joint Main Campus Committee on Full-Time Nontenure-Line Issues, garnered 282 signatures in early October. The chair of the committee and two signatories delivered the petition to the Office of the President. The proposition is being “seriously considered” by the university, according to Provost Robert Groves.
The full senate will meet again Sunday, Nov. 11 in Healy 104 at 5 p.m.

NASA awarded a $7 million grant to Georgetown University biology professor Sarah Johnson and a team of researchers to work on a project in search of extraterrestrial life.
The Laboratory for Agnostic Biosignatures led by Johnson and her team is working to pioneer a new way of approaching the search for life outside of planet Earth, focusing on Mars and on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. The NASA funding is set to continue for the next five years. LAB is a collaborative effort of 15 members from universities and scientific research institutions from around the world.
LAB researchers plan to work alongside existing efforts to find life outside of Earth, including the team for NASA’s Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars in 2012. Past efforts to locate life or the remnants of life on Mars through traditional methods, including searching for the presence of water, have been unsuccessful.
Johnson’s research will aim to find new methods of searching for extraterrestrial life, according to a Nov. 2 news release.
“Time and again, we’ve been bowled over by the indescribable foreignness of other worlds,” Johnson said in the news release. “Our goal is to go beyond what we currently understand and devise ways to find forms of life we can scarcely imagine.”
Johnson’s project was chosen for its attention to the development of new technology to find life outside of earth, according to Lindsay Hays, deputy program scientist of the NASA Astrobiology Program.
“It was considered highly meritorious scientifically, and the proposed goals and objectives for this project were well-aligned with one of the new research coordination networks that the NASA Astrobiology Program was seeking to start up centered on life detection science and technology development,” Hays wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Past researchers have searched for molecular frameworks that are present on Earth, as well as resources like water that have been deemed critical for the evolution of living beings.
Recent scientific discoveries of new life forms, including microorganisms like archaea and bacteria, fuel Johnson’s research and make her optimistic about the possibility of finding extraterrestrial life, according to Johnson.
“Novel bacteria and archaea are continually being found in what were previously believed to be lifeless niches – from sea ice, to the deep subsurface, to the high atmosphere,” Johnson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Johnson’s project will reevaluate the current methods of looking for life on other planets as a part of NASA’s wider effort to explore potentially habitable environments, according to Hays.
“This project will seek to understand how to identify life that is truly alien, and help researchers and instrument developers take these ideas into context as NASA moves forward with more Astrobiology and life detection focused missions,” Hays wrote.
Researchers plan to focus on chemical and surface patterns that do not assume new life forms will be similar to life on Earth — key in the search for extraterrestrial life.
With such groundbreaking and experimental work, there is some uncertainty as to whether the initiative will yield fruitful discoveries, according to Hays.
“As with all grants awarded by NASA, LAB will submit annual reports to show progress on the proposed research project; though continued support is dependent on progress, continued relevance to the NASA program, and the availability of funds, this is standard,” Hays wrote.
Hays hopes the initiative will improve and increase scientific collaboration into the future.
“As one of three co-leads to the new Research Coordination Network, the Network for Life Detection (or NfoLD), this team will be part of a larger group working on the science and technology of life detection and facilitate activities for this broader community,” Hays wrote.

The Washington, D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board is set to vote Nov. 15 on an application for the Georgetown Exorcist Steps, an outdoor staircase connecting Prospect Street and M Street, to become a historic landmark.
The Prospect Street Citizens Association filed the proposal Sept. 25 seeking to preserve the steps and adjacent retaining wall because of their historical significance, according to the application.
The steps were originally built in 1895 during the construction of the Car Barn, which was used to store trolley-cars. The 75-step stairway was featured in the 1973 film “The Exorcist,” which was based off the book written by William Peter Blatty (CAS ’50). In the film, one of the priests is depicted falling down the stairs.
The stairs were officially recognized as a tourist destination in 2015 with an official plaque signed by Mayor Muriel Bowser (D), an effort organized by D.C. resident Andrew Huff, according to The New York Times.
Huff expressed his support of the historic landmark proposal.
“I think the steps should get every recognition humanly possible,” Huff said in an interview with The Hoya.
The PSCA submitted the application over concerns of commercial development in the area, PSCA Board Member Catherine Emmerson said in an interview with DCist.
“Our group has long been concerned with any ongoing development activity at 3601 M St., NW,” Emmerson said. “It is our hope that raising awareness about these issues will preserve the Exorcist steps and the retaining wall for all to enjoy for decades to come. It’s too important a fixture in Georgetown to be rubber-stamped by another development-friendly bureaucracy without weighing all the facts.”
The group fears that the construction of condos at the former site of the Exxon Mobil Station on M Street could damage or disrupt the steps. The plans for the condos were conceived in 2013, but developers have faced difficulties in progressing because of Georgetown residents’ concerns, according to Curbed D.C.
Huff expressed his doubt over the effect that a historic landmark designation would have in halting the development of the condos.
“They’re making an effort to either stop or slow down this proposed development with the Key Bridge Exxon,” Huff said. “But from what I understand, this historic designation would not actually impact that proposed development.”
If approved as a historic landmark, any proposed alternation or demolition would require the mayor’s express approval, according to the Historic Landmark and Historic Protection Act of 1978.
Current D.C. historic sites not only include landmarks and districts, but also other sites such as parks and cemeteries, according to the Office of Planning website.
If a property-owner wishes to have a historical designation, then the individual nominating the property must conduct research on the site and consider the level of public interest before submitting an application that can cost from $100 to $1000, according to the Office of Planning website. The Historic Preservation Office then reviews the application within 10 days and sets up a hearing. During the 30-minute hearing, the applicants present their case to the HPRB which then votes on the proposal.
Although Georgetown itself is already a historic neighborhood, the historic landmark designation would provide the Exorcist Steps with additional protections, D.C. Office of Planning Associate Director Edward Giefer wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“The application seeks to recognize the wall and stairs as a landmark on the DC Inventory of Historic Sites and the National Register,” according to Giefer. “In general, this classification brings additional recognition to aspects of historic significance that make these properties individually distinctive above and beyond their being part of a historic neighborhood.”

Graduates from the Master of Business Administration program set new records in 2018 for salaries and job placements, the McDonough MBA Career Center announced Oct. 31.
For the class of 2018, 98 percent of graduates received an employment offer within three months of graduation, an increase from 93 percent in 2017. The career center reported that its services facilitated three out of four offers. Top employers for the graduating class of 2017 include Amazon, Deloitte and Uber.
“In recent years, Georgetown’s MBA program has expanded in areas such as experiential learning, data analytics, the intersection of business and policy, and strategic mindset preparedness. As a result, our students have become increasingly competitive as top candidates for the roles they seek upon graduation,” Doreen Amorosa, associate dean and managing director for McDonough Career Services, wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The percentage of employed graduates is not the only metric of graduate success that increased. For the class of 2018, the average full-time starting salary was $116,946, a four percent increase from 2017, according to the MBA Employment Report released by the career center. The average signing bonus was $31,036, a nine percent increase from $28,516 in 2017.
According to a McDonough MBA news release, career preparation for these roles is provided to students through the MBA Career Center and is incorporated into the MBA program through partnerships between the career team, student peer advisors and alumni.
“Our 28 Peer Advisors are second-year MBA students who have had successful summer internships across a variety of industries,” Amorosa said. “They are graduate assistants hired by the MBA Career Center to provide career coaching, mock interviews, resume critiques and cover letter reviews.”
Students also have the opportunity to engage and network through alumni, employer presentations, workshops, webinars and informational interviews.
JingFeng Wang, a 2018 MBA program graduate who is now a senior consultant for Deloitte, valued the resources provided to him through the career center.
“When I first came to McDonough, the Career Center helped me clarify my career search roadmap,” he wrote in an email to The Hoya. “During the recruiting process, coaches and peer advisors helped me improve my applications, build my stories for behavioral interviews, and connect me with alumni. With the help of the Georgetown alumni network, I was able to learn about Deloitte, understand its business, and adapt myself to company culture.”
The MBA program’s modernized approach also helps graduates market themselves to employers, Prashant Malaviya, senior associate dean of MBA programs, wrote in an email to The Hoya. Continuing to integrate technology into every aspect of the program, from admissions to student support, is a key priority for continued growth and success in the future, Malaviya wrote.
“A high priority for the MBA program is to infuse technology in all we do. Some initial ideas include using predictive analytics in the admissions process, using performance analytics to provide customized student support, incorporating AR/VR technology to enrich case and class discussions and using prediction models in facilitating career support,” he wrote. “These are some initial ideas we are toying with.”
Malaviya stressed the importance of being able to evolve and adapt the MBA program to changing times within the business education world.
“The business of business education is changing, with new formats of delivery emerging, new degree options available and a maturing of the traditional MBA,” Malaviya said. “In light of these changes, we need to continuously innovate to provide the best education for our students, and to set them up for success in the professional world.”
