A shooter opened fire at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday morning, killing 12 and injuring five others before getting shot by police. The shooting began around 8:20 a.m. with shots fired at Building 197, which contained approximately 3,000 employees.
The Navy Yard will be closed Tuesday, except for emergency response and mission-essential personnel.
Hundreds of Georgetown seniors, as part of the Senior Class Committee’s Dis-Orientation, were scheduled to attend Monday evening’s Washington Nationals game, which was postponed to 1 p.m. Tuesday in the wake of the shooting. Many students would have arrived via the Navy Yard Metro stop, which is less than a mile from the ballpark.
Monday’s shooting was the deadliest event in the District’s history since 1982, when an airliner plunged into the Potomac River, resulting in 78 deaths.
Mayor Vincent Gray said there were no indications that the shooting had a terrorist connection.
“We don’t have any known motive at this juncture,” Gray said in a press conference around 6 p.m.
Two of the injured were members of the Metropolitan Police Department, and both are in stable condition.
Among the dead was Aaron Alexis, the 34-year-old suspected shooter from Texas who carried an assault rifle, a handgun and possibly a shotgun.
In a release, the Navy confirmed that Alexis, who served in the Navy as a full-time reservist from 2007 to 2011, was a petty officer third class. The reasons for his general discharge are still unclear, though the Seattle Police Department reported that Alexis had previously suffered from anger-fueled blackouts, caused by post-traumatic stress disorder from participating in rescue attempts after the Sept. 11 attacks.
According to a police report, the Seattle police arrested Alexis in 2004 for shooting out the tires of a man’s vehicle during one of these blackouts. For an hour after the incident, Alexis claimed no knowledge of the shooting.
The Navy Yard, the country’s oldest military installation, is home to several high-ranking Navy personnel. Chief of Naval Operations Jonathan Greenert, a member of the joint chiefs of staff, was evacuated from his Navy Yard residence shortly after the first report of shots.
Navy officials said that the Navy Yard’s security is high, with gates manned by U.S. Marines and Naval District Washington security personnel. Visitors without military identification must present other identification as well as a valid reason for entry.
Alexis, who worked as a computer contractor for military contractor The Experts, had a government-contractor access card that allowed him entrance into the Navy Yard and other military installations. The Experts Chief Executive Thomas Hoshko said that Alexis had to pass a thorough investigation, conducted by military security service personnel, in order to receive his security clearance, which was only updated in July.
But hours after the shooting, authorities were still unclear about whether the shooting had been perpetrated by Alexis alone or by multiple shooters.
Initially, Metropolitan Police Department Chief of Police Cathy Lanier announced that, based on witness accounts and surveillance video, authorities were searching for two other suspects, but shortly afterwards, city officials announced that one of the suspects had been located and cleared of involvement. By Monday evening, however, Lanier announced that investigators were confident that Alexis was the only gunman.
In response to the shooting, the 11th Street Bridge, which leads to the Navy Yard, was closed. In addition, the D.C. Department of Transportation, the Van Ness building — which contains the D.C. Public Schools administration — and Eagle Academy Public Charter School were locked down due to their close proximity to the shooting. Flights out of Reagan National Airport were also briefly halted, and Nationals Park Parking Lot B was used as a safe zone for families to reunite in the immediate wake of the shooting.
As a precaution, Senate buildings were also locked down. In a message to sent Senate staffers at 3 p.m., Senate Sergeant at Arms Terrance Gainer wrote that staffers were not allowed to leave or enter the building for two hours or until the situation was deemed safe in the neighboring community, but the lockdown was lifted after one hour. Only Senate staffers will be allowed in the buildings until Tuesday.
In a press conference Monday afternoon, President Barack Obama stressed that the government would take severe action against those responsible for the shooting and expressed disappointment in the occurrence of the national tragedy.
“We’re confronting yet another mass shooting, and today it happened on a military installation in our nation’s capital. … These are men and women who were going to work, doing their job, protecting all of us. They’re patriots,” Obama said. “They know the dangers of serving abroad, but today, they faced the unimaginable violence that they wouldn’t have expected here at home.”
Obama ordered all flags in the White House and in all federal government and U.S. military facilities around the world to be flown at half-staff until sunset on Friday.
Students who were set to attend Monday night’s Nationals game can exchange their tickets for tomorrow afternoon’s make-up game, any other game this season — which ends Sunday — or any game in the 2014 season.
Given Georgetown’s location — about five and a half miles from the site of the shooting — Georgetown University Chief of Police Jay Gruber said that the campus alert level was not significantly affected. Nevertheless, all field officers, university officials and Department of Safety staff were notified in order to closely monitor the situation, and Gruber said he had several local and federal resources on hand.
“We want to make sure that they’re aware of any new information that comes out as a result of the investigation,” Gruber said in the afternoon. “Right now, there’s some suspect information, and we’ve put it out to our officers in the field.”
DPS also released a public safety alert to the campus community around 4 p.m., warning them to stay away from the Navy Yard neighborhood.
Fr. Pat Rogers, S.J., remembered the victims Monday at the regularly scheduled 10 p.m. Mass, and university chaplains will meet today to discuss any further response, according to Vice President for Mission and Ministry Kevin O’Brien, S.J.
Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, tried to reassure D.C. residents during Gray’s Monday afternoon press conference.
“This is the safest city in the United States,” Norton said. “Not safe from attack, but safe.”

To increase female representation among student leaders, the American Association of University Women partnered with Georgetown to hold the second annual Elect Her conference Saturday.
Seven of 28 Georgetown University Student Association senators last year were women, and women continue to serve on executive boards in lower number than their male counterparts across campus. The first Elect Her conference last spring addressed the lack of women in student leadership positions at Georgetown.
The conference comes before the GUSA senate election campaign is set to launch Thursday.
Event coordinator Abbey McNaughton (COL ’16) hopes that moving the conference to the fall will increase the number of women running for GUSA this year.
“As big as those elections are on campus, we hoped this could be directly correlated with either encouraging people to go to our conference for the sake of running for GUSA or people who come to us will be encouraged to run for GUSA,” she said.
The conference included a panel of student leaders and workshops on networking, campaign strategy and communication skills. Tara Andrews, a civil rights attorney who ran for office twice unsuccessfully, and Leticia Bode, an assistant professor in Georgetown’s Communication, Culture and Technology program, both spoke at the event.
“When women run, women win at the same rate that men win,” Andrews said. “The reason we don’t have women in office in the numbers as men is because women don’t run in the same numbers as men.”
McNaughton said she hopes the conference can teach students skills that will lead to increased female campus leadership.
“I do hope that this conference inspires female leaders in many different aspects across the board in the different elected offices around campus. In terms of GUSA in particular, females are definitely underrepresented,” she said. “I’m not saying females should run just because they’re females, but I do think that if we can equip females with the proper tools, then they will be able to more effectively run and represent what they believe in.”
Abby Cooner (SFS ’16), a GUSA senator and event coordinator, said that GUSA needs female representatives.
“I think the purpose of the GUSA senate is the represent the student body as a whole and represent every single voice fairly and equally and extremely well, and I also think that full potential will not be realized until every single portion of campus is recognized equally,” she said.
GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff Chandini Jha (COL ’16) hopes that diversity events such as these can help young women become future government leaders.
Jha, a former GUSA senator and Elect Her coordinator, hopes that skills learned at the conference can help women succeed in their professional careers in the future.
“We hope this event can be a catalyst for sparking activism; that women who attend realize they should assertively go after their goals and refuse to sit on the sidelines,” she said. “That’s something that’s up to our generation to begin to fix.”

The D.C. Taxicab fleet may soon find itself short on vehicles as the Sept. 30 deadline to equip all D.C. taxicabs with credit card readers approaches.
As many as 2,000 of the District’s 6,500 registered taxicabs will be impounded if they cannot install credit card machines by the deadline, which has been postponed from Aug. 30. Only 2,000 cabs complied by the original date, and no further extensions will be offered.
The remaining cabs had to apply for an extension by Aug. 15, which involved providing a signed contract between the vehicle owner and one of the 10 official payment service providers in the District. In addition, the owner had to certify that he or she had scheduled an installation with the PSP in the imminent future, D.C. Taxicab Commission spokesperson Neville Waters said.
The Modern Taximeter System — which includes driver verification and a GPS system, along with a credit card reader — was introduced by DCTC in response to customer demands for universal credit card acceptance in D.C. taxis.
Since August, DCTC has tracked the progress of taxis in meeting the new Sept. 30 deadline through weekly reports of installations from the PSPs. Waters said that current information suggests that between 1,000 and 2,000 cabs will not have installed the MTS by the end of the month, representing nearly one-third of the District’s taxi fleet.
Once taxicab owners miss this installation deadline, taxi inspectors will track down non-compliant cabs, which will be impounded and towed. These cabs will be released only in order to have the MTS installed, after which point they can be used for regular cab services.
Fourteen cabs were impounded and 65 were ticketed for violations of taxi code through a DCTC partnership with the Metropolitan Police Department in early September. Despite this success, however, Waters said the city would not form a special task force to find cabs without readers.
Nevertheless, Waters hopes that law enforcement agencies and D.C. residents will assist DCTC investigators in tracking down delinquent cabs. Waters encourages all customers to report cabs without electric payment machines after the Oct. 1 deadline.
Digital dispatch service Uber has been a vocal opponent of the MTS requirement since its inception. Uber claims that MTS is infeasible with its taxicabs — which are separate from its black car service — because of the incompatibility between most PSPs and current taxi hardware. Uber spokesperson Nairi Hourdajian pointed to the postponed deadline as further proof.
“Uber has long been a proponent of improving the consumer experience and that includes making payment seamless and hassle-free,” Hourdajian wrote in an email. “Innovation and technology should be used to ensure a more reliable, more efficient and seamless service for users. Unfortunately, the proposed DCTC requirements make the consumer experience more cumbersome, not less.”

The Senate Judiciary Committee will vote on Georgetown University Law Center professor Cornelia “Nina” Pillard’s confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Thursday.
To be confirmed, Pillard must be approved by the committee, after which she will be presented to the full Senate, where she must receive at least 51 votes out of 100.
Obama’s nomination of Pillard, a graduate of Yale College and Harvard University Law School, has spurred discussion on both sides of the aisle due to Pillard’s strong views on abortion and women’s rights.
Prior to joining the Georgetown faculty, Pillard worked for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and served as a Department of Justice attorney. She is best known for her legal work in support of women’s rights in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1996, she won on behalf of the U.S. in United States v. Virginia, which mandated that women be allowed to enroll in the Virginia Military Institute, the last all-male military college. She also successfully defended the Family and Medical Leave Act in 2003 and broadened it to apply to state employees.
Pillard’s pro-choice views and objections to abstinence-only education brought up concerns from conservative committee members during her July confirmation hearing, though several parties wrote letters of support, including representatives from VMI, the Women’s Bar Association and Georgetown. The letters praised Pillard’s support of women’s rights, scholarship and grasp of the law.
“I know that professor Pillard is exceptionally bright, a patient and unbiased listener and a lawyer of great judgment and unquestioned integrity,” Georgetown Law professor Viet Dinh wrote in his letter of support.
GULC Dean William Treanor agreed and commended Pillard’s scholarship.
“She is a beloved teacher and mentor, diligent in service to Georgetown and the larger community and a productive and highly respected scholar,” Treanor wrote.
Anti-abortion groups and conservative Republicans, however, have been outspoken critics of Obama’s choice for the D.C. court, primarily for her pro-abortion rights views. In an online post, Tony Perkins from the Family Research Council called Pillard “crazy” and “outrageous.” In particular, Perkins accused Obama of trying to slide Pillard past the usual confirmation stages by nominating her over the summer.
“America can’t afford to give a lifetime appointment to a radical ideologue,” Perkins wrote.
Georgetown University College Democrats President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said he fully backed Pillard for the nomination.
“We really think that she would make a great addition to the D.C. Circuit Court,” Tezel said. “She has shown — in the same spirit as a Ruth Bader Ginsburg, if you will — the kind of tenacity to advocate for gender equality that I think a lot of our members really want to see in the federal courts.”
Georgetown University College Republicans did not respond to requests for comment.

Recent allegations of ethics violations against Ward 2 Councilmember Jack Evans may threaten his bid for mayor.
George Washington senior Jackson Carnes recently accused Evans of giving The George Washington University an alley for its housing expansion in return for support in the upcoming election. Evans, however, denied these allegations.
“The gentleman made a false statement,” Evans told The Hoya. “That’s our understanding. We have never been contacted by anybody on anything.”
The Washington Post reported that Evans is currently under investigation by the D.C. Office of Campaign Finance. Allegedly, the councilmember violated campaign finance rules by collecting three separate donations from the same donor. Evans also denied these allegations.
Despite the recent publicity around these ethical allegations, Evans said that neither the Office of Campaign Finance nor the city’s ethical board have contacted his office.
“What happens is there’s a poor choice of words. There were never any ethics violations. There were never any questions,” Evans said. “There were just some inquiries that were being made, and they were satisfied. There are no ongoing discussions on any issues at this time.”
Nevertheless, these allegations could be potentially damaging for Evans, who is chair of the D.C. Council’s Finance and Revenue Committee. Evans launched his campaign based on his record of clean behavior and ethical decisions. In addition, according to The GW Hatchet, Evans has previously helped the D.C. Council pass legislation that would increase bookkeeping transparency.
Office of Campaign Finance Public Affairs Manager Wes Williams said that his office would not discuss any ongoing investigations.
Evans, who will run in the April 1 Democratic primary, will speak at an event sponsored by the Georgetown University College Democrats in November.
GUCD President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15), who has been an outspoken critic of Evans’ campaign, said that the accusations were disturbing, although he cautioned against forming judgment until solid evidence comes to light.
“What we’re initially hearing is a little bit alarming, but [it] ties into past concerns that a lot of people, including myself, have had with the way Jack Evans spends constituent money,” Tezel said. “So I would say it’s another allegation in what is an alarming trend with … our local council member.”
Evans came under fire in 2011 for using constituent funds to purchase season sporting tickets when the Post found that between 2002 and 2011, Evans spent $135,897 on tickets to the Washington Nationals, Washington Wizards and Washington Kastles, a Mylan World TeamTennis team. In comparison, Evans directed $101,564 toward charitable organizations, neighborhood associations and arts groups. When Ward 4 Councilmember Muriel Bowser — who will run against Evans in April — introduced an ethics overhaul bill in 2012, Evans aggressively pushed to amend the bill to allow him to continue buying season tickets, individually lobbying several councilmembers.
Regardless of the accusations’ validity, however, Tezel said that they could have an effect on Evans’ campaign.
“Any time this kind of stuff comes out, it definitely has an impact on the race,” Tezel said. “That being said, D.C. has sort of had a longstanding reputation of providing opportunities for politicians who may be embroiled in scandals or controversies to still see success at the polls.”

The Millennial Trains Project is taking a new approach to train rides by carrying groups of young entrepreneurs, artists and thinkers across the country as a mobile community to explore innovation and social change.
This past August, Ann Yang (SFS ’15) joined 23 other participants on the project’s inaugural ride from San Francisco to Washington. Over the 10-day trip, the group stopped at a half dozen cities along the way for seminars by mentors from various academic fields and local leaders.
Former Georgetown University Student Association President Patrick Dowd (SFS ’09) founded the Millennial Trains Project this past year. The idea for the project came from a project Dowd led while on a Fulbright Scholarship in India in 2010.
Sonia Vora (SFS ’15), who serves as Dowd’s chief of staff, and Sacha Simmons (SFS ’09) were also passengers on the train. Simmons is the founder of Sweat Everyday, a nonprofit helping people remain physically active, and she studied the exercise habits of residents of different cities during the cross-country trip.
Additionally, advisors for the project include Alyssa Lovegrove, associate director of the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative and Jeff Reid, director of the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative.
Yang found out about the project when she met Dowd during her internship at 1776, a D.C.-based incubator for nonprofits. Dowd said he was impressed by Yang’s confidence and eagerness.
In order to be eligible to participate, potential passengers, all between the ages of 18-34, must pitch an idea for a creative project online and use crowd-sourcing to raise the $5,000 participation fee.
Dowd notes that Yang had no trouble raising such a significant amount of money.
“She was really good at crowd funding,” Dowd said. “She raised the $5,000 necessary to go on the trip in two weeks.”
Part of Yang’s success was because James Hunt, an adjunct professor of entrepreneurship, pledged $500 to the project if Yang was able to raise an additional $2,000 from Georgetown alumna.
“To me it was a very clever idea, and it seemed to be kind of a unique way to combine an experimental trip with philanthropy,” Hunt said.
Yang’s journey culminated in “The Joy Project,” a documentary which juxtaposed interviews with Millennials against interviews with members of the Greatest Generation. Yang focused the project on risk-taking across the generations.
“I think that the recession actually created a unique space for people to take risks to do what they love,” Yang said.
Yang said that students at Georgetown are reluctant to take risks.
“We have this culture where risk aversion is seen as the way to go, and my conclusion from my trip is that risk aversion is stupid and people need to embrace failure because success hinders learning,” Yang said. “College should be about this environment where people can make mistakes.”
Yang is still editing her footage into a longer video project.
“The final platform is going to be called ‘Vibrant Day’ — it’s basically going to be about people who’ve taken risks to do what they love,” Yang said.
Other passengers on the train worked on projects ranging from research on food waste to access to poetry. Yang was the train’s youngest passenger and celebrated her 20th birthday while in Nebraska.
MTP recently garnered media attention with its 12th-place ranking on National Geographic Traveler’s “Traveler 50” list of “People, Places, and Ideas Changing the Way We Travel.”
Dowd said the project was a huge success, meeting and surpassing his hopes.
“I think that these crowd-funded train rides can be like the road trips of our generation,” Dowd said. “It’s a whole community that we have on these train cars and it’s really cool.”
MTP’s next journey coincides with Georgetown’s spring break in March, when it will take participants from Los Angeles to Miami.
“I think a lot of other people at Georgetown would be good candidates,” Dowd said. “It’s all about experiencing the world and engaging with really diverse people.”
Yang feels equally enthusiastic about the project’s success.
“It changed my life,” Yang said. “It really reduced my anxiety about what was going to happen.”

Campus Ministry is working to create a student-led advisory board for its 12 student religious organizations.
The proposed Campus Ministry Student Forum is the result of conversations last spring between Managing Director of Campus Ministry Andrew Johnson, Interreligious Coordinator Lisa Pannucci, former Georgetown University Student Association President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and GUSA Director of Student Space Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14).
The forum would be an advisory board composed of the presidents of Campus Ministry’s 12 component organizations, with an executive committee elected by the forum.
The current plan alters last spring’s proposal by removing chaplains and other administrators from the advisory board — a feature that led the GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee to reject some of Campus Ministry’s request for funding in April.
“We would not be requesting funding in the future. The students in the advisory board would be approaching GUSA instead,” Johnson said of Campus Ministry. “In the new model, chaplains serve as a resource, but not as voting members of the advisory board.”
Because the proposal is still in its early stages, Johnson and Pannucci are unsure of the timeline for the forum.
“At this point, we’re sort of packaging something and handing it off to the students,” Johnson said. “A lot of the timeline will depend on how students will choose to proceed with this process.”
Pannucci agreed and said she hopes that student leaders will make progress on establishing the forum this month.
Jewish Student Association President Sapir Yarden (SFS ’15) said that she met with Campus Ministry leaders at the end of August. JSA was the last of the 12 groups to sign on to the proposal after concerns about confusing their group’s focus on community building and social life with Campus Ministry’s religious and education focus arose.
“I was surprised but also pleased to see that my ideas were taken into consideration,” she said. “I think there’s still a long way to go in terms of what will be implemented but … it allows for better dialogue and more transparency, which was one of our biggest concerns.”
While the Interfaith Student Council was created close to 10 years ago as the advisory board of Campus Ministry that organization has evolved into a programming board during the past few years. Interfaith Council President Aamir Hussain (COL ’14) said the proposed forum would be an opportunity for the council to continue its focus on events but also its work catering to students without a specific faith tradition.
“We will still be able to maintain that kind of identity where traditionally we have a lot of people that are atheist or agnostic so anyone can feel welcome here,” Hussain said.
All students are invited to attend forum meetings.

Donald Trump may be moving closer to the White House — with his acquisition of the Old Post Office Pavilion on Pennsylvania Avenue NW.
The Trump Organization, which owns the Trump National Golf Club Washington, D.C., and Trump Winery — the largest winery on the East Coast in nearby Charlottesville, Va. — recently unveiled its $200 million hotel plans for the Old Post Office last week, which will include 250 rooms, several presidential suites, a spa and several conference facilities.
The Trumps, who originally signed a 60-year lease for the estate in early August, plan to begin renovations in spring 2014. Executive Vice President of Development & Acquisitions Ivanka Trump, who studied at Georgetown for two years before transferring to the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania in 2002, said the hotel’s doors should open by 2016.
According to Executive Vice President of Development & Acquisitions Eric Trump (MSB ’06), location was the main impetus behind the company’s acquisition of the Old Post Office, which was built in 1899.
“The location and building can never be replicated, and we are going to transform the building into one of the most incredible hotels in the world,” Eric Trump wrote in an email to The Hoya.
D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray has previously remarked that despite its designation as a top tourist destination with several historical landmarks, the District has a shortage of hotels, a void that the Trumps seek to fill.
Although the Trumps’ renovations call for bulletproof windows, fireplaces and two-person showers to fit with the Trump standard of luxury, Eric Trump stressed the importance of preserving the Old Post Office’s historical nature.
“The exterior of the building will largely remain the same, but the inside will undergo an incredible transformation,” Eric Trump wrote. “We plan on preserving the iconic pavilion and clock tower, in addition to the grand hallways, which will now lead to what will become the most iconic hotel rooms in the city boasting 16-foot ceiling height, views of the monuments and many other unprecedented amenities.”
The Trump Organization is also currently in negotiations to acquire the J. Edgar Hoover Building, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s current headquarters.
The Hoover building, a D.C. landmark that opened in 1975, came across the Trumps’ radar after reports surfaced that the FBI was planning to move to a newly constructed headquarters in the area. The FBI building has previously faced criticism for its outdated, Brutalist-style architecture, and the Government Accountability Office has also reported that the building is aging, deteriorating and in need of serious repairs.
“It is very early in the process, but we have looked at the building,” Eric Trump wrote. “Whether or not we proceed, the development of the FBI building is great for the area and will increase traffic at shops and restaurants inside Trump International Hotel [at the Old Post Office].”
Although the Trump Organization does not have any set plans for the Hoover Building, Eric Trump cited the company’s success in acquiring the Old Post Office Building as a precedent for future D.C. bids. According to the Washington Post, the Trump Organization was originally considered a long shot for the Old Post Office.
“Ownership of assets is a key differentiator of the Trump brand as many other hotel brands are merely management companies and have little financial stake in their assets,” Eric Trump wrote.
“We often own, develop and operate the hotels in our portfolio, which allows us to be highly selective and sets an unparalleled standard of excellence within the hospitality industry.”
Since the Hoover Building was put on the market, the FBI reported that it has received approximately 35 offers.
Regardless of whether the company officially bids on the FBI building, Eric Trump said that D.C. is an important location for Trump Organization.
“We are very positive about D.C.’s long-term prospects,” Eric Trump wrote. “We are always looking for potential world-class projects with the Old Post Office being a perfect example.”

Students will no longer lug a bag full of laundry across their building only to find that all the machines are taken when the Office of Facilities and the Georgetown University Student Association launch a new mobile application late this fall.
LaundryAlert, an online and mobile application used by many universities, shows which machines are in use and offers alerts about specific machines.
The Office of Facilities currently operates 14 laundry rooms across campus. The system upgrade would require modifications to each washing machine and dryer to establish an Internet connection.
GUSA Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) spearheaded the initiative within GUSA, working with Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey to determine its feasibility. Ramadan hopes to integrate the service with the Georgetown mobile app and said the university should complete the system by the end of November.
“Over the course of the summer, we came up with common sense things to improve campus,” Ramadan said. “Laundry falls under facilities and we pinpointed that.”
Morey said that the idea to bring LaundryAlert to campus came from a post on Georgetown Ideas, which received 201 votes, making it the 26th most popular idea.
Facilities will pay for the cost of the upgrade, but the change will not affect current laundry prices, which stand at $1.50 per wash or dry. Schools that currently use LaundryAlert include the University of Virginia, the University of Pennsylvania and Duke University.
Students were generally enthusiastic about the idea, but some doubted that it would solve the problem of newly clean laundry being stacked on top of machines or on the floor.
“I think it’s useful,” Manasi Parekh (COL ’15) said. “It’s annoying when I go there and machines are not working, but I don’t think I’d use the alerts a lot.”
“I time [laundry] myself. If you’re attached to technology, it might be useful, but I feel like people will still take out your laundry,” Monica Vizconde (COL ’14) said.
Once the upgrade is finalized and the application is released, GUSA and Facilities will work to publicize the effort.
“We will make sure every Georgetown student will know about it,” Ramadan said. “Being in Lau at 11 [p.m.] and knowing you have to do laundry, but not having to walk all the way to your dorm only to find the [laundry] room is full would be nice.”

The new president of Syracuse University has an unusual alma mater for the king of the Carrier Dome: Georgetown.
Kent Syverud (SFS ’77), who is currently dean of the School of Law at Washington University in St. Louis, was named the 12th chancellor and president of Syracuse on Sept. 12.
The chancellor search committee chose Syverud, who grew up in Irondequouit, N.Y., after a two-year process. The committee, composed of student, faculty, alumni and staff representatives, unanimously recommended Syverudfrom a pool of 270 candidates to Syracuse’s board of trustees. Syverud will begin work at the university in January.
“Chancellor-designate Syverud is exceptionally well prepared to guide S.U. as we work to build on our tremendous momentum and continue to raise S.U.’s profile while fulfilling its proud legacy,” Syracuse University Board of Trustees Chairman Richard Thompson wrote in an email to the Syracuse community. “Throughout the selection process, he distinguished himself by the impressive range and depth of experience he brings.”
Thompson cited Syverud’s experience, which includes time as dean of the Vanderbilt University Law School, clerk for Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor and trustee of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Trust — BP’s $20 billion fund that was created in response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
Thompson also praised Syverud’s reputation in the higher education community as both a “visionary” and “strategic thinker,” based on his work bringing both the WashU and Vanderbilt law schools into greater national prominence.
Syverud, who was officially introduced to the Syracuse community Thursday afternoon, expressed his desire to learn more about the institution.
“I still have so much more to learn about this university, this city and this region,” Syverud said in a speech to the community. “I need to learn from each of you. … I need to learn how to bleed orange. I will work hard to learn exactly that.”
With Syracuse moving from the Big East Conference to the Atlantic Coast Conference this year, Syrevud made reference to ACC rival Duke University in his speech but did not mention Big East rival Georgetown.
“I am absolutely certain that we are going to accomplish great things together … that we are going to flatten the competition, including Duke, and that along the way we will help the whole world see Syracuse as the best university,” Syverud said in his speech.
Despite the historic rivalry between Georgetown and Syracuse, Syracuse Senior Vice President for Public Affairs Kevin Quinn said the university was excited to welcome its new chancellor.
“We’ve had a great rivalry, and we hope that in the future that rivalry can continue, and we’re excited to welcome chancellor-designate Syverud into the Orange family,” Quinn said.
Quinn said that Syverud was unavailable for comment due to a high volume of media requests.

Many Georgetown graduates go on to volunteer for the Peace Corps or do other development work. Now, the Georgetown Development Initiative will help interested students get a head start on international development as undergraduates.
The club’s founders thought that Georgetown lacked a club that dealt specifically with development issues on an undergraduate level. The group, founded last spring, received approval from the Student Activities Commission this fall.
“Our primary goal is getting people together who share the aim of fostering international development through small-scale, sustainable and innovative projects that could be applicable in different parts of the world,” GDI President Berk Guler (COL ’14) said.
As the first undergraduate group on campus devoted to development issues, GDI has reached out to faculty in the department of economics and the Georgetown Public Policy Institute for advice.
“We’re the first undergrad group targeting international development so we don’t have a precedent,” Guler said. “A lot of this is exploration, reaching out to faculty and other organizations.”
Guler sought the advice of associate professor of economics William Jack, co-director of the Georgetown University Initiative on Innovation, Development and Evaluation. GUIDE often sends development-minded undergraduates to work on projects abroad during summer break.
“I think you should do what you care about,” Jack said. “I think Georgetown students have a lot of enthusiasm and energy in doing development work and I encourage them to do so. This is just an opportunity for students who are interested to get involved and I think that’s great.”
GDI member Sona Jain (SFS ’16) emphasized that the club differs from groups with similar aims on campus, such as Hilltop Microfinance Initiative, because of its focus on development research.
“I think microfinance initiatives are very important and can be incredibly successful; however, they are only one facet of development solutions that have been discovered,” Jain said. “GDI is more like a general forum through which people with all types of interests in development can congregate and discuss these issues.”
This semester, the group will focus on bringing speakers to campus and building relationships with non-governmental organizations in the Washington, D.C. area.
“Our aim is to get development experts in the area to campus,” Guler said. “We hope to build connections to NGOs in D.C. while we start working on one or two small-scale projects.”
The initiative has identified water security and cell-phone access as two areas of focus during the coming semester, with the goal of working through NGOs that are already doing water drilling in Kenya and Uganda.
Jain emphasized that the club is driven by its diverse membership.
“I think that development issues require very close attention to the intricate differences between different cultures, different political systems,” Jain said. “The diverse range of students that we have involved helps to accomplish that.”
