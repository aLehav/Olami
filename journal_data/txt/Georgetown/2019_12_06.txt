Many Georgetown University Student Association members have missed their GUSA bystander training sessions, GUSA Vice President Aleida Olvera (COL ’20) said at the weekly meeting of the GUSA senate Monday.
Starting this year, GUSA executive members are required to attend a bystander training session run by the university’s Health Education Services to educate individuals on how to safely intervene in potential incidents of sexual violence, according to Olvera. GUSA senate members were not required to go to the meetings but were invited by the executive, according to Senate Speaker Juan Martinez (SFS ’20).
Members of the GUSA executive cabinet agreed to do the trainings when they joined the executive branch, according to Olvera. The GUSA executive plans to enforce consequences against executive members who do not attend the trainings, according to Olvera and President Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20). 
“The way that we plan to enforce this is that the members who do not attend Bystander training will be forced to make note of this on the GUSA Directory and GUSA website,” Francis and Olvera wrote in an Oct. 31 email to The Hoya. “They will have a mark on their names that indicates that they were not bystander trained.” 
Sixty-eight GUSA members indicated they would attend one of the three offered bystander trainings, according to Martinez. Of those 68 sign-ups within GUSA, only 26 members were present at the actual trainings. There were a total of three GUSA-specific trainings, one Nov. 22 and two Nov. 24. 
For a full-time staff member of the university’s Health Education Services to lead a bystander training, a minimum of 10 students is required, according to Olvera. While 11 individuals signed up for the single training Nov. 22, the training was canceled, since only two senators and two executive members showed up. The two sessions held on Nov. 24 ran, but only 12 participants attended the first session, and only 11 attended the second, according to Olvera.
The GUSA senate has considered requiring the trainings, however, senators were only recently informed about the sessions, according to Martinez.  
“While Senate leadership strongly encouraged senators to attend these trainings, we were only informed of these trainings a few weeks before they were set to occur,” Martinez wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As a result, it would not have been fair to make them mandatory as many students already had plans to travel that weekend.” 
Canceling the Nov. 22 training because of low turnout was disappointing, according to Senator Daniella Sanchez (COL ’20), who was one of the three GUSA senators who showed up for the training. 
“I was not able to attend the Sunday sessions, so I’m not sure how that turnout was, but the way Aleida was speaking, we could tell that it wasn’t sufficient,” Sanchez said.
Some senators may not have been able to attend the sessions because of the close proximity to the Thanksgiving holiday, according to Senator At-Large Charlie Wang (SFS ’22).
“I think the main reason is that it’s just the week before Thanksgiving and people are slacking a little bit,” Wang said. “But I think in general, I think GUSA is trying to address these kinds of issues, and it’s important to address these kinds of issues as well.”
The new bystander trainings are intended to prevent sexual misconduct in GUSA, according to Sanchez.
“It hasn’t been implemented like this before,” Sanchez said. “This is a new step that the administration is trying to take to show that GUSA is trying to be proactive in preventing any issues from arising within the senate. This is the first time that this many sessions have been provided for GUSA exclusively.”
Former Vice President Naba Rahman (SFS ’19) and 10 other executive cabinet members resigned Sept. 11, 2018, to put pressure on then-GUSA President Sahil Nair (SFS ’19) to resign amid sexual misconduct allegations against him. Later that morning, Nair resigned. After an emergency GUSA senate meeting that night, senators demanded all of the resignations be upheld. Rahman and the remaining cabinet members officially resigned Sept. 14, 2018.  
The implementation of these trainings is also meant to combat the negative reputation of GUSA in matters of sexual assault and misconduct after last year’s events, Olvera said during the senate meeting.
“I don’t even want to beat around the bush — the sentiment towards GUSA is that we’re full of people who perpetuate sexual assault and violence against women,” Olvera said at the meeting.
To respond to the attendance problems for these trainings, GUSA is set to hold rescheduled trainings next semester, according to Olvera.
“We do want to show the student body that we are a different GUSA,” Olvera said at the meeting. “We have this ugly sentiments towards us because we have never shown ourselves or proven ourselves to be different, and this was our opportunity to do so. So I’m really disappointed that there was not a lot of people there.”
CORRECTION: This article has been updated Dec. 6 to clarify that the trainings are only mandatory for members of the GUSA executive branch. The article was also updated to clarify how many senators attended the Nov. 22 training.

The D.C. Council unanimously voted to expel Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) on Dec. 3 because of ethics violations, marking the first time the council has ever decided to remove a councilmember.  
The vote comes after nine of Evans’ fellow councilmembers called for his resignation following the release of a Nov. 4 report detailing 11 ethics violations by Evans since 2015. The report, which was compiled by a law firm the council retained to independently investigate Evans, alleges that Evans used his council position to promote the interests of clients of his consulting company. Evans, the city’s longest-serving lawmaker, was not present for the vote on his removal. 
Despite the unanimous vote, Evans’ expulsion is not yet definite. The ad hoc committee that voted for Evans’ expulsion Dec. 3 will need to meet again Dec. 10 to vote on an official expulsion resolution, Councilmember Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3) wrote in an email to The Hoya. The council will then need to hold a hearing during which Evans would be invited to testify before it can formally vote to remove him. The date of the hearing has not yet been set.
At the Dec. 3 meeting, each councilmember detailed their reasons for supporting Evans’ expulsion. Evans’ actions showed a lack of respect for fellow councilmembers and were an embarrassment for the council, according to the opening statement of Councilmember Robert White (D-At Large). 
“Right now, the only person in this city who doesn’t know that Mr. Evans must resign is Mr. Evans,” White said in his opening statement. “If he cannot bring himself to resign, then we must vote to expel him. We have no choice based on what we know.”
Evans’ actions have betrayed the public’s trust, according to Councilmember Brandon Todd (D-Ward 4), who was himself accused last spring of an ethics violation when he attempted to influence a Washington, D.C. State Board of Education election. 
“It would be impossible to move forward in the current situation,” Todd wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I believe anything short of expulsion is unacceptable and would send the wrong message to District of Columbia residents.” 
Before the Dec. 3 vote, Ward 2 constituents began a separate campaign for a special recall election, which would allow voters to remove an elected official from office before that official’s term has ended. 
A petition submitted by Ward 2 Citizens Recall, a group of local residents campaigning for a recall election of Evans’ seat, was rejected by D.C. election officials, after Evans filed a challenge to the Board of Elections on Nov. 29. The petition garnered 5,588 signatures, exceeding the threshold of 4,949, but was rejected because signatures were deemed invaild. 
The rejection of the petition proves that Ward 2 residents are not in favor of his ouster, Evans said in an interview with The Washington Post.
“One can conclude the voters in Ward 2 do not want me to leave office and others should take note of that,” Evans said.
Despite the efforts of Ward 2 Citizens Recall, constituents should not have to be responsible for handling Evans’ mistakes, according to Councilmember Elissa Silverman (I-At Large). 
“I know Councilmember Evans’ lawyers have made the argument that we shouldn’t expel him, and that we should let the voters decide, either in the upcoming recall or the primary. I couldn’t disagree more,” she wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We shouldn’t pass the buck, making the voters do our work for us. Previous Councils didn’t have this power to expel, but I imagine this tool was put in place so we could act in a case like this.”
The Dec. 3 vote is an appropriate measure to regain public trust in the council, according to Mayor Muriel Bowser (D). 
“Throughout this investigation, I have called on the Council to be fair and urgent in their considerations, but to act quickly to regain the public’s trust in the Council as an institution,” Bowser wrote in a Dec. 3 statement. “As a former member of the Council and now Mayor, I stand by them as they make these very difficult decisions.” 
Six Democrats are currently running in the primary set for June 2, 2020, to replace Evans, who has yet to announce a run for reelection. The candidates are Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners Patrick Kennedy (D-2A), Kishan Putta (D-2E) and John Fanning (D-2F); former Obama administration staffer Jordan Grossman; and political newcomers Daniel Hernandez, a former Marine, and Yilin Zhang, who is active in the League of Women Voters’ D.C. statehood campaign.
The Ward 2 district includes both the Georgetown neighborhood and Georgetown University’s main campus. Although Georgetown University College Democrats will not take a position on the Ward 2 race, they support the council’s vote to expel Evans, according to GUCD chair Rebecca Hollister (COL ’21). 
“The evidence is overwhelmingly against him, and it seems that he is worse than just a bad representative–he is corrupt,” Hollister wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I will be interested to see how the primary now plays out; it is a very crowded field and many of the candidates have a lot to offer. At this point the candidates need to just convince Ward 2 voters that electing them won’t lead to more of the same.”
Expulsion is the only adequate measure to punish Evans’ behavior, according to Cheh. “Mr. Evans has betrayed each and every one of us–his colleagues, the government, and the residents of the District of Columbia,” Cheh wrote in a Dec. 3 tweet. “I don’t think there is any other action that we can fairly take other than expulsion. Nothing short of that would be proportionate to what he’s done.”

Sara Rotenberg (NHS ’20) became the first student from the Georgetown University School of Nursing and Health Studies studies to be named a 2020 Rhodes scholar from Canada, according to a Nov. 23 university news release.
Winners of the Rhodes scholarship, the oldest international fellowship in the world, can pursue a degree at The University of Oxford in Oxford, England. Rotenberg, a global health major, will pursue a master’s degree while studying evidence-based social intervention and policy evaluation in fall 2020, according to the news release.  
Rotenberg first learned she had received the scholarship in November while she was visiting family in Canada. While the scholarship surprised Rotenberg, it validates her hard work and academic accomplishments, she said in an interview with The Hoya. 
“It was a bit of a blur, I’d say, and I was with my parents, and we were all very excited. We all cried a bit and hugged each other. It was a good moment,” Rotenberg said. “I’ve worked very hard, and I’ve had a lot of very cool experiences, so it’s nice to be recognized for that, but ultimately I think a lot of it is about what’s next.”
At Georgetown, Rotenberg completed a student fellowship with the Georgetown University Global Health Initiative and wrote a paper about population policies in sub-Saharan Africa with global health professor John May. The two presented their work at the Population Association of America annual conference in Austin, Texas, in April 2019.
The pair submitted their paper to a peer-reviewed journal, which is currently considering the work for publishing. Throughout the process, Rotenberg exhibited an understanding of difficult demography concepts and an excellent work ethic, according to May. 
“I was really impressed because of her quick grasp of the technicalities of demography,” May wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I’m impressed by her drive and hard work, she’s a young person but she knows exactly what she wants to do and where she wants to go.”
Rhodes scholars are chosen annually after applicants undergo a written application, a series of interviews and formal receptions with former panelists and former Rhodes scholars. Thirty-two winners are selected from the United States; however, Rhodes scholarships are also available to citizens of certain other countries. The scholarship had a 0.7% acceptance rate in 2017, with accepted candidates being chosen for their academic merit, character, leadership and commitment to the common good, according to the Rhodes Trust website.
While abroad in Mumbai, India, this summer, Rotenberg researched the accessibility of the Mumbai Metro system, one of the world’s largest development infrastructure projects. Her research was aimed towards offering suggestions for how the Mumbai Metro could become the first universally accessible metro system to individuals with disabilities.
Rotenberg was able to present the results of her research to Mumbai Metro planning team officials, who are receptive to her ideas, according to Rotenberg.
“I got to show their planning team how they can be accessible, and they’re very interested in working with me and professor Irfan Nooruddin, who runs the India initiative, and continuing to see how we can do that,” Rotenberg said. “So that’s pretty exciting, and we just want a grant for that so we can continue that work.”
The Rhodes Trust was established in 1903 after Cecil Rhodes, a British businessman and colonial politician, organized for scholarships to be set up in his name in his will. Trustees for the Rhodes Trust manage the fund for these scholarships and help ensure the continuity of the scholarship. 
Rotenberg is the 27th Rhodes scholar from Georgetown. The last Rhodes scholar from the university was Deirdre Collins (COL ’17), who was granted the distinction from Bermuda in 2018. Alumnus and former President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68) also stands among Georgetown’s recipients of the fellowship, though he was honored after graduating from Georgetown.
Receiving the scholarship is a significant distinction that reflects Rotenberg’s overall character, University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) wrote in an announcement on the university’s website.
“This is an extraordinary accomplishment and our entire Georgetown community joins me in offering our sincere congratulations to Sara,” DeGioia wrote. “Her dedication to her studies as well as her advocacy for the equity of people with disabilities embodies the very best of our values as a University, and we look forward to all she will accomplish as she pursues graduate work at the University of Oxford.”
The Rhodes scholarship will give Rotenberg the opportunity to continue her work on disability inclusion advocacy in international development, which she has been studying through her major, she said. 
“My proposal is working on disability inclusion and international development, so it’s really ‘How can I use the next two years to build a body of evidence and inspire policy that is disability inclusive?’” Rotenberg said. “That’s what that means to me and where I’m going with it, and I’m really excited about that.”
Correction: This article was updated Dec. 7 to clarify the nature of Rotenberg’s work researching the Mumbai Metro.

The Georgetown Center for Security and Emerging Technology is launching a project to study the effects of the rise of artificial intelligence on cyber operations.
The Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence project, known as CyberAI, will invite fellows and Georgetown University faculty to research increasing threats to cybersecurity, the effect of automation on cyber defense and the degree to which cyber operations will become faster and more powerful, according to a Nov. 21 news release from CSET. The project is funded by a $2 million grant from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, a nonpartisan, private charitable foundation established by Hewlett-Packard co-founder and his wife.
Cyber operations specialists utilize computer programs to create an effect across cyberspace, according to the United States Army website. Offensive operations involve targeting an enemy and conducting hostile activities. Defensive operations are conducted to protect data, networks and systems by detecting, identifying and responding to attacks.
The CyberAI project will illuminate how artificial intelligence can be an important tool in improving the effectiveness of both offensive and defensive cyber operations, according to project leader and CSET senior faculty fellow Ben Buchanan. 
“There’s some promise that it can enable defenders to better protect their networks, especially by finding signs of a breach,” Buchanan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “But AI also might enable the offensive side of cyber operations to be faster and more potent.”
The project will also examine the potential risks artificial intelligence may cause in cyberspace and national security. AI systems are susceptible to traditional software vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit. Hackers are also able to manipulate machine learning systems to cause the network to fail or reveal confidential information, according to an Oct. 22 CSET news release.
Established in January 2019, CSET is the largest research center focused on artificial intelligence technology and policy in the United States. The center aims to join experts in the field of artificial intelligence and advanced computing to Georgetown’s networks in security policy to produce analysis of the national security implications of emerging technologies, according to a Feb. 28 university news release.
The center opened on Georgetown’s campus this fall. In its inaugural year, CSET team developed a reputation for rigorous research and thorough analysis that it hopes to build upon this year, according to Jason Matheny, founding director of the CSET.
“The CyberAI project will build on those strengths, offering us the chance to provide new insights at the intersection of cybersecurity and AI,” Matheny wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We’re excited to expand in that direction as we head into year two.”
Along with conducting research, CSET also delivers nonpartisan analysis to the policy community, according to the CSET website. 
AI is an important tool for cyber defense that is complex and often unintelligible to those unfamiliar with the field, Buchanan wrote. Through CyberAI, Buchanan hopes to help policymakers better understand artificial intelligence.
“Our job is to understand it and explain it to policymakers,” Buchanan wrote. “We’re excited to expand the areas in which we can do that.” 
The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation awarded the grant Nov. 11 for a two-year term. The grant will enable CSET to expand the scope of work it engages in, according to the statement from  CSET.
“The CyberAI project will build on CSET’s strengths: the rigor of our research, our reputation for thorough and impartial analytical products, and our growing data science capabilities,” the statement read. “We are grateful to the Hewlett Foundation for recognizing the importance of cybersecurity’s intersections with AI, and for their confidence in our ability to deliver results.”
The money from the grant will enable CSET to hire experts in the field and focus more deeply on the impact of cybersecurity and AI on national security, according to Buchanan.
“We’re building a critical mass of cybersecurity, AI, and national security talent at CSET, and this grant will help us accelerate those efforts,” Buchanan wrote. 
This article has been updated to clarify the Georgetown Center for Security and Emerging Technology’s abbreviation.

Students from the Georgetown chapter of March for Our Lives joined hundreds of demonstrators outside the Supreme Court to advocate for gun control reform Dec. 2.
The case, filed by the National Rifle Association, a gun rights lobbying group, claims that a New York City ban on transporting handguns outside city limits is unconstitutional, according to a Supreme Court report. Gun control activists worry a victory for the NRA will establish an impregnable legal barrier for future gun control efforts, according to CNBC. The city eliminated the law after the court agreed to hear the case.
MFOL GU partnered with other gun control advocacy groups at the rally Monday, including Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. 
The lawsuit, pushed to the Supreme Court by the NRA, represents a desperate effort to prevent gun control legislation, according to Chris Stauffer (SFS ’22), co-chair of MFOL GU and co-state director of MFOL DC.
“The NRA knows that it can no longer beat the gun violence prevention movement at the ballot box — just look at the 2018 midterm elections — so it has turned to the courts as a last-ditch effort to protect the interests of the gun lobby,” Stauffer wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The rally Monday displayed solidarity among youth activists as they pushed for reform, Stauffer wrote. 
“It was important for students to rally today to show the courts, and our country, that we are demanding change, and we will not stop until that happens,” Stauffer wrote. 
Frequent and deadly gun violence has propelled gun control to the forefront of domestic political discourse in the past decade. Students created the MFOL movement after a former student murdered 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. 
Chronic gun violence and powerful student activism inspired Stauffer to join MFOL, according to Stauffer.
“I saw the gun violence that was happening across our country and I needed to do something about it,” Stauffer wrote. “Seeing the movement that came out of the tragedy that happened in Parkland — that was led by young people — inspired me to take action.”
Stauffer and Margaret Gleason (COL ’22) established the Georgetown chapter of MFOL in 2018. Gleason, the second co-chair at MFOL GU, become involved in MFOL when gun violence impacted her own community, she wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
“The tipping point was when a fellow exchange student on my study abroad program was killed in the Santa Fe High School massacre in 2017,” Gleason wrote. “I was already determined to do something, but once my community was touched, I knew I had to do whatever it takes.”
Young activists often struggle to gain legitimacy and make their voices heard, according to Stauffer. 
“Some of the challenges that I have faced as the Co-Chair of MFOL GU. and the Co-State Director of MFOL DC, is simply getting people to take young people seriously,” Stauffer wrote. “On so many occasions, staffers from the offices of elected officials will underestimate, or condescend, the MFOL members that go to meet with them.”
Lawmakers stood alongside activists and survivors of school shootings at the protest. Congressman Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), Congressman Anthony Brown (D-Md.) and Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) each addressed the crowd of demonstrators.
The case being analyzed could have lasting implications for gun control policy, according to Brown.  
“The Supreme Court is hearing arguments that could impact common sense gun safety measures: policies like stopping domestic abusers from possessing guns, red flag laws that keep guns out of the hands of people who pose a threat to themselves or others, and banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,” Brown wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Gun control measures are necessary and reasonable steps to improving safety in American neighborhoods, according to Connolly. 
“Yesterday, I was proud to stand with gun safety advocates to demand responsible gun control,” Connolly wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Commonsense proposals like reinstating the assault weapons ban, mandating universal background checks, and closing the gun show loophole are a first step in making our communities safer.”

The Georgetown University Student Association senate established a Blue Campus working group to explore launching a student referendum to designate Georgetown as the world’s first Blue Campus on Nov. 24. 
A Blue Campus designation would affirm the university’s commitment to environmentally conscious practices focused on ocean preservation and urge the administration to participate in sustainability efforts. The working group will conduct research related to conducting the Blue Campus referendum and engage with student groups. If the working group decides to move forward with a student referendum, the GUSA election commission would seek to introduce the referendum by spring. 
The resolution, introduced by Senate Sustainability Chair Leo Rassieur (COL ’23), passed unanimously. Greater student body participation in campus environmental efforts is important to improving sustainability at Georgetown, according to Rassieur. 
“I really hope that the working group will allow us to write a referendum that takes into account students all across campus, not just people who are in leadership positions,” Rassieur said in an interview with The Hoya. “I hope that it will allow us to get more support from — initially, me — people who were initially skeptical that efforts to make the environment more sustainable actually work out.” 
GUSA President Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20) and Vice President Aleida Olvera (COL ’20) expressed support for the Blue Campus project and collaboration with The Blue S.O.S., an international sustainability organization, in a statement published Oct. 15. 
“We believe that The Blue S.O.S.’s focus on preserving our oceans constitutes a vital aspect of our environmental commitment. Our planet’s oceans serve as a major carbon emissions sink, source of biodiversity, and a resource for many people around the world,” the statement said. “Consequently, the Francis-Olvera Administration of GUSA views the protection and preservation of our oceans as an essential part of responsible global citizenship.”
With a Blue Campus designation, the sustainability policy coalition, GUSA executive’s environmental policy team, will aim to sponsor educational programs about sustainable practices and partner with The Blue S.O.S. to invest in ocean-friendly student businesses, according to the executive’s Oct. 15 statement. 
The GUSA executive will continue supporting the senate’s sustainability efforts, according to GUSA Press Secretary Harper Thomas (SFS ’22). 
“The Norman-Aleida administration stands with the Senate in supporting Georgetown’s designation as a Blue Campus,” Thomas said in an email to The Hoya. “We hope to continue working alongside our counterparts in the senate to encourage legislative progress on this and other important issues relating to environmental sustainability.” 
The Blue Campus resolution follows a campuswide pivot toward sustainable environmental practices over the past decade. In February, the university established the Laudato Si’ Fund, named for Pope Francis’s 2015 letter on environmental justice sent to Roman Catholic bishops, to encourage collaboration combating sustainability challenges. The fund sets aside $300,000 in grants to help fund student-, faculty- and staff-proposed projects that seek to combat local and global sustainability challenges.
The Office of Sustainability, established in 2013 to improve Georgetown’s environmental footprint, was nominated for a sustainability prize in 2018. 
The Blue Campus initiative is an important step in campus sustainability efforts, according to Amelia Walsh (SFS ’20), president of the Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network. 
“We think that the more focus environmental initiatives get from the campus community, the better it is for all of us and our environment,” Walsh wrote in an email to the Hoya. “We are in support of these initiatives and encourage the entire campus community to take part in these efforts.”
By becoming a Blue Campus, the Georgetown community has the opportunity to support an important environmental initiative, according to GUSA Senator Eric Bazail Eimil (SFS ’23).
“Honestly, it’s an incredible cause. Oceans are the main resources for documenting climate change, so without policy resolutions, we will not stop climate change,” Eimil said during the meeting. “So if Georgetown can make efforts to reduce its plastic impact, become actually more friendly to ocean ecosystems, be actually good in both and we have a really robust policy that we can use.”

A greater sense of compassion is needed to combat the persistent homophobia in various parts of the world, author and LGBTQ activist Garrard Conley said at an event Tuesday.
The event, titled “Radical Compassion with Garrard Conley,” was hosted by the Georgetown University Lecture Fund. At the event, Conley discussed his experience growing up in a fundamentalist Christian home in Arkansas and being enrolled by his parents in a conversion therapy program at the age of 19. This experience was the focus of Conley’s 2016 autobiography “Boy Erased: A Memoir,” which was later adapted into the 2018 film “Boy Erased.”
Conversion therapy is the practice of trying to change an individual’s sexual orientation using psychological or spiritual interventions. Although showing compassion toward those who hold homophobic beliefs may not change their beliefs, compassion can help survivors of conversion therapy process their trauma, according to Conley.
“We’re often told that if we just loved people enough, they would accept us. That’s not what I’m telling you here today,” Conley said. “I’m telling you here that I made this choice to be compassionate towards the people who had done bad things to me, as a way to retain my sanity.”
Although numerous medical organizations, including the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association, have stated that there is no evidence indicating that conversion therapy is effective in changing sexual orientation, conversion therapy continues to be practiced in many parts of the country.
In addition to being ineffective at changing sexual orientation, conversion therapy can also have many negative effects on the mental health and wellbeing of LGBTQ people. Studies show that LGBTQ youth who are rejected by their families due to their identities are nearly six times more likely to report high levels of depression and more than eight times more likely to have attempted suicide when compared to youth from accepting families.
Conley was able to forgive and rebuild his relationship with his parents in the years following his time in conversion therapy after they realized their mistake in enrolling him in the program. This familial reconciliation can be beneficial for those who underwent conversion therapy, according to Conley.
“That bridge that can be rebuilt between those parents and children, it’s like life-saving for a lot of people, and it actually helps them reclaim their past and helps them reclaim who they are,” Conley said.
Conley now works alongside other activists to help end conversion therapy in the United States and abroad.
Conversion therapy uses shame as a way of forcing people to change their sexual orientation, Conley said.
“There was the idea that we had somehow all chosen to be addicted,” Conley said. “I was placed there with people who were dealing with anything from bestiality, pedophilia, marriage issues, they just lumped us all together.”
His own traumatic experience in conversion therapy pushed him to share his story to dispel misinformation around conversion therapy, Conley said.
“When my parents searched for conversion therapy online, what came up was like positive results, like you can be cured here. Now what comes up is my story and stories like mine, saying this is evil and there have been this many bans passed on conversion therapy,” Conley said. “It felt like there was this emphasis to tell the story first of all, and to keep doing it.”
Nearly 700,000 individuals in the United States between the ages of 18 and 59 have undergone conversion therapy at some point in their lives, according to a 2018 report by the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law. While stories like his are now becoming more recognized, there is still a need for greater representation in terms of whose stories are able to be heard, according to Conley.
“We need diversity in the representation of who is a survivor. There are very few stories of trans survivors that are out there that are mainstream. There are very few stories of people of color who are being elevated to the same level as my story,” Conley said. “It’s actually happening all over and it’s not just in the U.S., it’s all over the globe.”
While compassion alone is incapable of solving all the issues facing society today, Conley emphasized the necessity of understanding the conditions under which people may develop homophobic mindsets.
“I’m skeptical of my own stance that I’ve taken here. I’m constantly skeptical of whether or not compassion can actually save us from evil or from the horribleness of the world,” Conely said. “I don’t know, but I do know that personally, what I had to do to survive was to actually rely on this kind of understanding that I had cut myself off from and that saved my life.”

The D.C. Board of Zoning Adjustment postponed issuing a zoning exception to Call Your Mother at a Dec. 4 hearing amid community disagreement on granting the deli a variance. 
The popular bagel deli, which was slated to open on the corner of 35th and O Streets in October, must provide evidence proving it needs a variance to operate its deli, the board ruled. The variance would allow the deli to operate in a residential area and prepare hot foods. 
The board, a body that approves applications for zoning variances, postponed its final decision on the application for a variance to grant Andrew Dana, founder and owner of Call Your Mother, more time to pursue other options for obtaining zoning approval, such as corner store rules, which allow commercial use of certain properties in residential zones. The board will render its final decision at a hearing on Dec. 11.
Without the zoning variance, the deli would be barred from cooking hot food and could only sell untoasted bagels and pre-made sandwiches, which customers would then have to warm themselves, according to Dana. 
“We are not asking for some huge leash,” Dana said in an interview with The Hoya. “We are basically just asking, ‘can we turn the toaster around and make the sandwiches for you?’”
Under the 2012 zoning rewrite, corner stores can be used for commercial purposes in certain residential zones. In Georgetown, corner stores do not qualify for this rule if they are within 750 feet of a commercially zoned property. Call Your Mother’s location does not qualify because it would be within 750 feet of Wisemiller’s Deli, which is zoned commercially. 
Frederick Hill, the chairman of the Board of Zoning Adjustment, recommended that Dana see if Call Your Mother could be an exception to the rule, as an alternative to obtaining a variance.
Opposition to the deli comes from Georgetown residents who reside in the immediate vicinity of the building. Melinda Roth (LAW ’03), who owns a house on O Street and attended the hearing, supports the opening of the deli but opposes the variance due to concerns about Call Your Mother’s location.  
“This really sets a precedent in the city, which is a very slippery slope, that, if granted, this variance, there’s no street that is safe from someone coming in and opening a business,” Roth said in an interview with The Hoya. “The zoning regulations exist for a reason – to be able to separate commercial zones and residential ones.”
Call Your Mother’s opening has prompted fears of residential property being devalued because excessive noise and foot traffic would deter people from purchasing homes in the general vicinity, according to Roth. 
“I think some of the other homeowners are very concerned about, you know, rightly so, what might happen to their property values,” Roth said. “As a homeowner and taxpayer in D.C., I do expect the zoning regulations to protect me.”
Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E voted to recommend that Call Your Mother’s zoning variance application be granted earlier this year in a 6-2 vote. Call Your Mother has not provided sufficient evidence that the variance is necessary, according to ANC Chair Rick Murphy, who voted against the measure.
“I think I can safely say the majority of my constituents in the single-member district favor the granting of this variance,” Murphy said at the hearing. “I oppose the application because the applicant has utterly failed to carry its burden of proving the property owner would suffer exceptional and undue hardship if the requested use variance was not granted.”
The vast majority of Georgetown University students support Call Your Mother’s opening, according to Georgetown University Student Association Senator Samuel Dubke (SFS ’21), who co-sponsored a resolution endorsing the deli’s opening that passed Nov. 24. 
“Every student to whom I have spoken about this issue has expressed overwhelming support for Call Your Mother Bagels,” Dubke said in an email to The Hoya. “It is telling that we voted unanimously in favor of the resolution to support Call Your Mother Bagels. Students are overwhelmingly supportive of the business.”

The reason students support this is that they just want bagels and really have no other stake in the fight.  They have not made any significant financial investment in the community, they do not contribute to the tax base, and they would be largely unaffected by the negative consequences of allowing these folks a variance.  In addition, they are transient members of the community and will be gone as soon as their degrees are conferred.  So, while its nice that the students want bagels and think that CYM makes good ones (though one could argue CYM’s bagels are offensively overpriced), their views are entirely irrelevant to the actual zoning issues at stake.  And, before you “OK, NIMBY” or “OK, Boomer” (which would be incorrect, BTW) me, know that I went to Georgetown and sat where you sit.  Trust me, once you work your whole life and invest serious $$$ on real estate, your views on zoning laws and their enforcement will change.

Georgetown University joined over 100 other academic institutions in signing an amicus brief to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in support of temporary employment authorization for international students Nov. 25.
The Optional Practical Training program, managed by the Department of Homeland Security, grants international students a yearlong extension to their F-1 student visas to pursue professional opportunities related to their fields of study. The brief supports an extension to the program for STEM students, which a labor union challenged as unconstitutional in 2016. 
The opportunity for international students to continue their education through firsthand training is a vital part of the student experience, according to Rachel Rubin, director of International Student and Scholar Services at the Office of Global Services.
“Georgetown is a global community — one made stronger by our religious, cultural and international diversity. Georgetown firmly believes in the power that comes from our students bringing knowledge gained in a classroom into real-world experiences,” Rubin wrote in a statement to the Hoya. “The opportunity to undertake internships, employment, or research is critical to student success after leaving Georgetown.”
International students are required to hold an F-1 visa to study at any college or university in the United States. Upon graduation, F-1 visa holders can apply for the OPT program. In 2016, President Barack Obama changed DHS regulations to add the OPT-STEM program, which allows international students who work in STEM fields to extend a general OPT program for an additional two years. 
The Washington Alliance of Technology Workers, a labor union, sued the DHS in 2016, alleging that the program unfairly causes U.S. workers to compete with foreign workers within the STEM industry.
International students in the OPT-STEM program contribute to the U. S. economy and advances science and technology efforts across the country, according to Heather Stewart, director of immigration policy for NAFSA: Association of International Educators, an international student advocacy organization. 
“Our nation’s economy and educational institutions are undeniably enriched by the presence of talented, diverse, and motivated international students and OPT is a key factor in attracting those very students,” Stewart wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The U.S. is now in a global competition for international students and scholars. To ensure that we continue to benefit from these individuals and their investments in our communities, we must maintain this time-tested program.”
The lawsuit against the OPT-STEM program was first brought to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in 2016 in the lawsuit Washington Alliance of Technology Workers Union vs. U.S. Department of Homeland Security. In 2019, a judge ruled that the case against the program could move forward after inaction on the case for three years.
If judges were to rule in favor of the challenge, universities and colleges in the United States could expect to see international student enrollment decrease because international students would only be able to extend their F-1 visas for up to a year after their graduation, according to Law 360, a legal news service. 
The OPT-STEM program must continue, so international students have the opportunity to find employment after graduation, according to Rimpal Bajwa (SFS ’22), activism committee leader for Hoyas for Immigrant Rights.
“International students are kind of at a disadvantage when it comes to the job market because after graduating, their visa expires, and the company they work for has to sponsor them for a work visa,” Bajwa said in an interview with The Hoya. “This is an additional step most companies aren’t willing to take. OPT allows international students to not only gain an education, but allows them to translate the skills they’ve learned in the classroom to actual work environments.” 
Continuing the OPT-STEM program will ultimately benefit scientific research in the United States, according to Stewart.
“Attracting international students and scholars is an important way that the United States grows its knowledge economy,” Stewart wrote. “The countries that create the most attractive environment for the world’s finest scientists will do the most to enhance their scientific leadership. Indeed, the very diversity that we gain through openness to international talent itself fuels innovation and creativity.”

Gender bias will not significantly influence voters’ election decisions in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, panelists said at a Dec. 4 event.
The event, titled “Deconstructing Gender Bias: Implications for 2020,” was hosted by the Women in Public Policy Initiative and the Georgetown University Institute for Politics and Public Service at the McCourt School of Public Policy. At the panel event, current and former Institute of of Politics and Public Service fellows reflected on how preconceived notions about individual candidates’ electability may affect the results of the 2020 presidential election.
Looking forward to the 2020 presidential election, voters will not discriminate against candidates based on their gender in the general election, according to Katie Walsh Shields, senior advisor for the Republican National Committee.
“I don’t believe that, outside of primaries, someone wins or loses an election in this country because of gender,” Shields said. “I think in a general election, specifically a presidential election, I mean, you have to remember that the majority of voters in this country are women.”
The event also featured a discussion between McCourt School Fellows Antonia Ferrier, staff director for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), and Olivia Alair Dalton, founder of strategic communications firm Dalton Strategies. Stephanie Valencia, co-founder of EquisLabs, which works to empower the Latino electorate to make their voices heard in American politics, also spoke at the event. Emily Van Dusen, a masters of policy management student and member of WiPPI, moderated the panel. 
In the ongoing 2020 Democratic primary, a record six women entered the contest for nominations. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and self-help author Marianne Williamson are still running to be the Democratic nominee after Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) disbanded her campaign this week.
Even though conversations about which candidates are most electable seem to dominate conversations in the lead-up to elections, whether or not someone appears to be electable does not matter, according to Valencia. 
“I think electability is a little bit of a farce,” Valencia said. “I think, if we look at, over the last few election cycles, including 2016, a lot of people didn’t think Donald Trump was electable. A lot of people thought Hillary Clinton was electable in 2008 and that Barack Obama was not electable in 2008.” 
Discussions around electability are irrelevant, as the only way to know whether or not someone is electable is to observe the ultimate results of the race, according to Ferrier.
“There are a lot of reasons why people win or lose, but if they’re electable, the way you tell is if they win,” Ferrier said.
Female candidates struggle to attract fundraising donors due to preconceived notions around female electability. Polling is not representative of the actual voting electorate, which includes a female majority. Additionally, sexism and racial bias are still fervent in both political parties, according to Valencia.
Candidates are not elected to positions based on their gender, but rather their qualifications. Lack of campaign success should be attributed to policy failures instead of a candidate’s gender, according to Ferrier.
“It’s position; it’s not gender. I don’t doubt for a second that it is harder for women to win,” Ferrier said. “I don’t care what political party they are from if there are problems in their campaign. They had missteps and they choose to blame it on their gender as opposed to they were out of step with voters or their campaign made missteps.” 
Moving forward, both political parties must work past perceived prejudices when electing the next president in the 2020 election, Valencia said.
“We need to deconstruct what makes somebody electable and I think for the most part it’s probably very similar on the left as it is on the right,” Valencia said. “In both parties, I think we have to deconstruct sexism and racism that exists within our own parties about who is electable.”
This article has been corrected to clarify that current and former Institute of of Politics and Public Service fellows spoke at the event.

U.S. policies that prevent members of the transgender community from serving in the armed forces contradict the core values of the military, panelists said at a Dec. 4 event. 
The Spectra Alliance, a collaboration between the Georgetown University Student Veterans Association and GradPride, hosted the event, titled “The Lived Experience of Transgender Service Members & Veterans,” in Lohrfink Auditorium. The event featured a panel of three transgender military veterans who shared their personal experiences and perspectives on policies regulating transgender members of the U.S. military. 
U.S. policies that compel transgender people to conceal facets of their identities in the military discredit the military’s character, according to panelist Paula Neira, U.S. Navy veteran and clinical program director at the Johns Hopkins Center for Transgender Health.
“We should never ask somebody to lie about who they are,” Neira said. “And we can’t have core values of honor and integrity and courage and expect people to lie to us because that corrodes the core values of the institution.”
In 2018, President Donald Trump’s administration implemented a new policy about transgender people joining the military. Anyone who has undergone cross-sex hormone therapy or sex reassignment surgery or who is unwilling or cannot meet the fitness requisites associated with their biological sex cannot join the military without a waiver, according to the Department of Defense.
Most individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria, which is when someone experiences discomfort or distress that their biological sex and gender identity are mismatched, are disqualified from joining the military. However, individuals with gender dysphoria who have been “stable” for 36 consecutive months in their biological sex and are willing to serve in that sex are permitted to participate in the military, the Department of Defense wrote on their website. 
The policy does not serve as a ban on transgender people in the military, according to the Department of Defense. The policies, however, effectively prevent transgender people from serving in the military, according to Neira. 
“If you aren’t in the military today and you’re transgender and you want to join the military, you can’t,” Neira said. “If you’ve had any kind of gender-affirming treatment, you are forever banned from applying to the military under this policy.”
In 2016, then-Defense Secretary Ashton Carter lifted the ban on transgender people serving openly in the military for the first time. The Trump administration cited budgetary costs to justify reimplementing policies that inhibit transgender people’s participation in the military.
Defense Department data indicates that $8 million, or .016% of the $50 billion healthcare budget for active members of the military, has been used for transgender people between July 1, 2016 and Feb. 1, 2019.
The statistic discredits the Trump administration’s arguments that cost justifies regulations on transgender military members, panelist Charlotte Clymer, a U.S. Army veteran, said. 
“Cost is not an issue,” Clymer said. “There are no reasons why trans people can’t serve. The only reason a trans person should not serve is if they can’t meet the military standard.”
Members of the U.S. military should be judged based on their skills and not excluded based on their identities, panelist Karen Kendra Holmes, a Maryland Defense Force veteran, said. 
“We have a lot of trans people who are qualified and skilled,” Holmes said. “We put our time, effort and resources into training them and you’re going to get rid of them because they’re transgender? They saw what I was bringing to the unit, not because I was transgender because they didn’t even know.”
Over 134,000 American veterans are transgender, and over 15,000 transgender people are serving in the military today, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality. The U.S. government must eliminate barriers to transgender military service, according to Clymer.
“Our country should not be debating who someone loves or who they are, ever,” Clymer said.
Individuals should advocate for and support all members of the transgender community to combat harmful stereotypes, according to Holmes. 
“None of us are the same,” Holmes said. “We need you to stand up for us. Stand up. If you hear something negative about somebody, stand up.”

Local residents voiced concerns that the Department of Parks and Recreation management takeover of Duke Ellington Field would limit access for community residents and public school students at an Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E meeting on Dec. 2. 
The move sparked outrage because of a perceived lack of transparency in DPR’s communications with the community since the shift was first announced in July. DPR plans to execute the transfer from District of Columbia Public Schools on Dec. 14, despite requests from various community and school leaders to postpone due to concerns that students will be disadvantaged by the change in management. 
The shift in management will increase neighborhood access, according to Delano Hunter, acting director of DPR.
“The transfer of Ellington Field from DCPS to DPR is intended to facilitate improved access for neighbors, the broader Ward 2 community, and neighboring DCPS schools,” Hunter wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We will continue working with the community to meet their needs and consider stakeholder feedback in the process to provide a space all residents can enjoy for years to come.” 
The field is used primarily by three D.C. public schools: Duke Ellington School for the Arts, Hardy Middle School and School Without Walls High School. The Georgetown University track and field team also uses the field, due to a contract stemming from Georgetown’s role in funding renovations in 2005. 
Residents pushed back against DPR’s plan, questioning Ely Ross, DPR chief of staff and the representative speaking at the ANC Meeting. Eric Langenbacher, head of the Burleith Citizens Association and a professor in Georgetown’s department of government, asked for DPR to halt the transfer process and allow more time for receiving community feedback. 
“I’m almost a 50-year-old man. I don’t want to beg, but I’ll beg for a second,” Langenbacher said at the meeting. “Please give us more time before you make any kind of irrevocable decisions.”
Langenbacher’s call for an extension was echoed by other community leaders. Residents were startled by the transfer announcement, justifying their request for more time, according to ANC 2E Commissioner Kishan Putta. 
“They were very confused that Councilmember Evans repeatedly wrote and said publicly that the transfer would not happen until after a series of public meetings. That never happened and then this 30-day notice dropped unexpectedly,” Putta wrote in an email to The Hoya. “So I don’t blame them for being frustrated and for asking for more time – at least till after a public community meeting in January after the holidays, as I requested at the ANC meeting.”
A contract with DPR allows The Maret School, a prestigious D.C. private school, exclusive access during after-school hours to Jelleff Field, a public sports field in Glover Park. There are fears that a similar arrangement would occur with Duke Ellington Field, limiting community and public school access, according to Langenbacher. 
“Few if any Burleith neighbors I’ve spoken to support the transfer to DPR,” Langenbacher wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Many fear that the field will become another ‘asset’ that the city authorities can permit to the highest bidder–likely a bevy of out-of-neighborhood private schools or sports leagues. The field is not suitable for a big increase in use.” 
Fourteen DPR properties have been involved in sponsorship agreements, leases and license agreements since 2001, with frequency increasing in recent years. These agreements largely grant private entities and schools priority access to the properties in exchange for funding.
DPR’s prioritization of private interests exemplifies bad governance, according to Martin Welles, vice president of the PTO at Hardy Middle School. 
“What kind of government is this?” Welles said at the meeting. “And what kind of precedent are you setting when you enter into agreements like this and try to privatize our public assets?”

This article discusses sexual assault on campus. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
The “Potomac River Rapist,” who committed a string of violent crimes in the Washington, D.C. area in the 1990s, including raping and murdering a Georgetown University summer resident, made his first appearance in court Nov. 21.
Police arrested Giles Warrick, 60, at his home in Horry County, South Carolina on Nov. 13. Warrick said only his name during the 20-minute hearing, at which Warrick was charged with first-degree murder and sexual assault, according to The Washington Post. Warrick will be held in the D.C. Central Detention Facility until his next hearing, set for Jan. 17, 2020.
Warrick is a suspect in 10 rapes in D.C. and Montgomery County between 1991 and 1998, but has only been charged in eight cases he has been explicitly linked to through DNA testing, according to The Washington Post. Among Warrick’s alleged victims was Christine Mirzayan, a 29-year-old summer resident in Georgetown’s Nevils dormitory. At the time of Mirzayan’s death, she was serving as a postdoctoral fellow at the National Academy of Sciences. 
The Christine Mirzayan Science & Technology Policy Graduate Fellowship was founded in her honor in 1998, and Mirzayan’s legacy is carried on by the program’s participants, according to program director Gail Cohen. 
“Christine had a strong desire to communicate the excitement of science and its contribution to making the world a better place,” Cohen wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Her desire lives on through all the individuals who are Mirzayan Fellows.”
On August 1, 1998, Mirzayan was attending a party with friends near 44th Street NW and decided to walk home around 10 p.m. alone. Her half-naked and badly beaten body was discovered in a wooded area behind the Village A dormitories the next afternoon. 
The prospects of solving the case were originally thought to be slim. Consequently, fear of violent crime increased on campus following the incident, prompting a community response, according to The Hoya’s article.
“The murder has heightened concerns about safety on and around campus this year,” the article read. “During the New Student Orientation in late August, school officials placed extra emphasis on student safety education and sent letters to all on and off-campus residents describing the incident.” 
The advent of genealogical DNA testing led authorities to Warrick, according to The Washington Post. Detectives working on Warrick’s case submitted a genetic profile with DNA that had been collected at the crime scenes over the years to Parabon Nanolabs, a Virginia DNA forensics company. The DNA sample was processed through a large database, looking for genetic matches. Through this process, researchers were able to find distant family members who had similar biological characteristics.
From this evidence, investigators were able to narrow down their search by speaking with family members, according to the Washington Post. They discovered that Warrick had spent a long period of time in Maryland and D.C. in the 1990s. After discovering this connection, detectives arrived in South Carolina to get a DNA swab from Warrick that they found matched their known profile. 
Although the Potomac River Rapist’s crimes are 30 years in the past, issues of sexual assault and crime are still relevant to Georgetown’s campus. Among undergraduate students, 31.6% of women and 11.6% of men reported experiencing nonconsensual sexual contact since entering college, according to the 2019 Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Misconduct. Furthermore, D.C. experienced record-high homicide rates early in 2019. 
While the Georgetown University Police Department cannot provide details of their actions during the time of the reported murder, GUPD remains dedicated to keeping campus safe, according to Chief of Police and Associate Vice President for Public Safety Jay Gruber. 
“Georgetown University conducts coordinated patrols 24 hours a day to ensure campus security and works closely with the Metropolitan Police Department, federal law enforcement agencies, and the District of Columbia Fire Department, to address issues surrounding campus and respond quickly to incidents that may arise.” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya.Resources: On-campus confidential resources include Health Education Services (202-687-8949 or [email protected]) and Counseling and Psychiatric Services (202-687-6985); additional off-campus resources include the D.C. Rape Crisis Center (202-333-7273) and the D.C. Forensic Nurse Examiner Washington Hospital Center (844-443-5732). If you or anyone you know would like to receive a sexual assault forensic examination or other medical care — including emergency contraception — call the Network for Victim Recovery of D.C. at 202-742-1727. To report sexual misconduct, you can contact Georgetown’s interim Title IX coordinator at 202-687-9183 or file an online report here. Emergency contraception is available at the CVS located at 1403 Wisconsin Ave NW and through H*yas for Choice. For more information, visit tinyurl.com/GUselfcare.

Effective journalism can encourage activists to address ongoing racial profiling and violence against the black community in the face of continued police brutality, panelists said in a Dec. 4 event. 
The event, titled “Before Ferguson, Beyond Ferguson,” was hosted by the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs in Riggs Memorial Library. At the panel, three panelists discussed the implications of reporters’ coverage of unrest in Ferguson, Mo., after a white police officer killed unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in 2014.
More proactive journalism about police violence and racial profiling has enabled activists to organize against the injustice, according to Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Wesley Lowery, who covered the 2014 events in Ferguson for The Washington Post. 
“Our ability for us to so quickly see and hear about what’s happening across the country has allowed them to turn their outrage and anger and apply it directly to try and influence change in the places where they are,” Lowery said. 
Panelist Teddy Washington made national headlines after he and nine friends were pulled over by police after leaving a restaurant in Clayton, Mo. — which is about 10 miles from Ferguson — in 2018. The officers, who had received reports of a robbery at the restaurant, forced the group to return to the restaurant, according to NPR. Washington and his friends then showed their receipts to the restaurant management, who confirmed that they were not the perpetrators. 
The incident transformed Washington’s outlook on racial profiling in the United States, he said. 
“I’d read statistics about how African Americans are treated in the United States, but it was strictly through statistics and books,” Washington said. “When these things happened to me, it made me question one, what I was doing as far as I was just reading these statistics, understanding how people were being affected, but I wasn’t doing any legitimate work to address these problems.”
Award-winning writer Richard Weiss has been documenting Washington’s story as a part of the “Before Ferguson, Beyond Ferguson,” project, an initiative that aims to document racial inequity in St. Louis. Weiss, the project’s executive editor, is working alongside two journalists to publish and compile 12 multimedia stories that chronicle inequality. 
Though Washington’s interaction with the police was resolved without violence or arrests, Washington and his friends initially feared that the police would initiate violence, according to Washington. Their reaction to interacting with police was not surprising given the incident’s proximity to Ferguson, according to Weiss. 
“They know enough that this is the town where Ferguson happened and if they did something wrong, or that the police perceive to be wrong, they could be lying dead on the street,” Weiss said.
Stories like Washington’s demonstrate that the racial profiling and police violence that transpired in Ferguson continue throughout the United States, Lowery said. 
“We wanted this to be a problem that happened over there, that that place must be uniquely bad, must be uniquely wrong and it couldn’t happen where I live, in my backyard,” Lowery said. “But what became increasingly clear, over these years, that the story of Ferguson is the story of America.” 
Increased public coverage of instances of brutality is changing people’s perspectives about racial profiling and police violence across the country, Lowery said.
“If you think about the demonstrations and protests after Ferguson, much of the conversation broadly was about well, ‘what is everyone so upset about; how often do these things happen; and if he did something wrong, well, won’t he get punished for this? Why don’t we just wait and see what happens?’” Lowery said. “We now collectively know a lot more about how these processes work.”
