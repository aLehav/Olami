Effective immediately, the university will no longer require advance registration from students holding parties on campus, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson announced in an email to the campus community.
An email from Village A Hall Director Michael Ritterbeck sent to residents detailed other aspects of the new policy. According to the email, at least one of the residents of the apartment or townhouse where a party is occurring must be of legal drinking age, and any student wishing to hold a party must attend a “I Know How to Party” training session offered by the Division of Student Affairs.
Olson wrote in a separate email that the decision was made due to observations that students manage on-campus parties in responsible ways. “We want to encourage student social life in safe and legal ways on campus and believe this change will help accomplish that goal,” he said.
The policy shift was first announced as part of the 2010 Campus Plan negotiations and is one of several initiatives intended to draw late-night student socializing back on campus. Other programs include the presence of food trucks on campus between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m. on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights and increased shuttle services to M Street.
“I think the party registration system was a functional system, but it did very little to help social life on campus,” Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13), vice president of the Georgetown University Student Association, said. “This change will invigorate the social life on campus, which is exactly what we need to do because we have run into problems with parties and events off campus.”
According to Olson’s email, the university will also be re-evaluating the student life policies on campus in upperclassman apartments and townhouses.

Freelance journalist Austin Tice (SFS ’02, LAW ’13) has gone missing while reporting in Syria, according to The Washington Post.
Tice entered Syria through the Turkish border in May and has provided on-the-ground reporting for several media outlets, including The Post, CBS News and Al Jazeera English.
According to The Post’s report, Tice was due to leave Syria in mid-August. But his family told the newspaper Thursday that they have not heard from him in over a week.
“Austin is a talented and courageous journalist whose work has helped to shape the world’s understanding of this humanitarian and political crisis,” Marcus Brauchli, executive editor of The Post, said in a statement.
Tice’s LinkedIn profile shows his willingness to report in dangerous situations.
“I can write, film, snap and speak, so if your organization is looking for an all-in-one crisis correspondent willing to get the stories others won’t, call me,” it reads.
The Syrian civil war is among the most violent of the ongoing revolts in the region and is especially dangerous for the media. Sixteen journalists have been killed in the country since November 2011, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Three of these deaths occurred in the past two weeks.
Brauchli said The Post is conducting an ongoing investigation into Tice’s whereabouts and hopes to guarantee his safe return.
