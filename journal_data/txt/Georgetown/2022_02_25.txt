The number of Washington, D.C. residents who died while unhoused decreased in 2021 for the first time since 2016, while D.C. council members and government officials disagree over how to ensure this trend continues in the future.
Between 2013 and 2020, the District saw a 600% increase in deaths of people experiencing homelessness. In 2021, there was a 31% decrease in deaths with 124 deaths in the calendar year compared to 180 deaths in 2020. The most recent census of unhoused individuals in the District in January 2021 found that about 5,111 residents in the District are currently experiencing homelessness.
The Pandemic Emergency Program for Medically Vulnerable Individuals (PEP-V), a program introduced at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, offers hotel room accommodations for unhoused people at high risk of severe COVID-19 illness before eventually transferring them to permanent supportive housing. 
The program may have led to the decline in deaths, according to Ann Marie Staudenmaier, staff attorney at the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless.
“I attribute the drop this year in deaths to PEP-V, because it really took a lot of those medically vulnerable people and got them off the streets in a really quick way,” Staudenmeier said in an interview with The Hoya. “With PEP-V, they literally offer somebody a hotel room, and they could be in that room that night. It really was life-saving, and I think that contributed to the drop in deaths.”
PEP-V’s success, in addition to the decrease in deaths, warrants the expansion of the program as it faces discontinuity, Staudenmaier said. 
“We want to see the city continue that program, and we’ve tried really hard to get the city to expand it over the last two years and COVID, and have had moderate success with that,” Staudenmaier said. “But I don’t know that the city government will continue it once COVID is really, you know, gone.”
PEP-V may provide a blueprint for protecting unhoused individuals who are at increased risk for various illnesses, according to Maya Brennan, housing advisor for At-Large Councilmember Elissa Silverman.
“When COVID is no longer as much of a public health threat, there are other viruses, such as the flu, that also pose a much greater health and fatality risk based on age and underlying conditions,” Brennan wrote to The Hoya. “So, it does seem worth looking into ways to keep the highest-risk segment of those experiencing homelessness out of congregate settings where virus transmission is harder to avoid, even after the COVID risk is minimal.”
Still, there are conflicting opinions among council members regarding the expansion of PEP-V. 
According to Ward 1 Councilmember Brianne Naudeau (D), PEP-V fails to remedy the issue of homelessness in the long term.
“I would say that PEP-V is a stop-gap and housing is the answer,” Naudeau wrote to The Hoya. 
The Coordinated Assistance and Resources for Encampments (CARE) program launched in August of 2021 in an effort to close three specific homeless encampments — located at the L and M St. Underpasses, O St. NW and E St. NW — around the District and connect residents with housing and services. However, the program received criticism for the premature closure of many encampments during the coldest months of the year, which forced many residents to clear encampment sites without having received housing. 
Legislation to help unhoused District residents should not require them to clear their belongings, Staudenmaier said.
“I’d like to see legislation that doesn’t allow the city to conduct these aggressive and encampment clearings where they drive people away, and basically take away their personal items and destroy them,” Satudenmaier said.
Programs confronting homelessness in the District must include collaboration between various District agencies to succeed, according to Brennan.
“One of the important pieces of addressing homelessness in the District is making sure that our agencies are talking to each other,” Brennan wrote. “Because if they aren’t, there’s no way their programs are reaching people well.”

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate unanimously passed a resolution amending the organization’s bylaws to remove inactive roles.
At the Feb. 20 meeting, senators voted to remove roles including parliamentarian and the sergeant-at-arms, the latter of which keeps order at meetings of the senate. The resolution also amended the bylaws to prevent members of the Constitutional Council, GUSA’s judicial branch, from making public statements on GUSA policies and requiring GUSA justices to remove themselves from cases they may have conflicts of interest in. 
Currently, there are no GUSA members who serve as parliamentarian or sergeant-at-arms. 
While bylaw amendments may not significantly impact the student body, the changes will allow GUSA to operate more effectively in order to work for student advocacy, according to GUSA Senator Dominic Gordon (SFS ’24), who co-introduced the bill at the meeting.
“There is too much nonsense in regards to bylaws that gets in our way of doing our actual job,” Gordon said in an interview with The Hoya. “I know it may not be the most pressing thing in the world sometimes, but it does get in the way of our ability to operate.” 
Additionally, Gordon believes that the Constitutional Council should be removed entirely from GUSA as it has not operated effectively for years. 
“I’ve made it pretty clear in the past that I think we should get rid of the Constitutional Council,” Gordon said. “They have not met in several years and I feel like it’s ridiculous to have a whole branch of government that doesn’t really exist. They have pretty unclear ethical guidelines, which has been a problem like in the past.” 
In the past, members of the Constitutional Council have published editorials in campus publications, including The Hoya, which have created barriers to GUSA’s operations, Gordon said. 
To operate effectively, GUSA needs a complete structural overhaul, according to GUSA Senate Vice Speaker Rowlie Flores (COL ’22).
“This recent legislation that we passed removed clauses regarding a parliamentarian and a sergeant-in-arms. These are roles that in my four years of GUSA have not heard of,” Flores wrote to The Hoya. “But these changes do not come close to all the changes we need to make. We need to consider election reform, which I argued in our Ways and Means meeting requires its own legislation due to the controversies surrounding it.”
Last fall, GUSA proposed a restructuring referendum to reform the organization by abolishing the senate and executive. Although 72.12% of voters voted in favor of the referendum, it failed to pass when the election did not meet the 25% minimum voter turnout rate needed for constitutional referendums.  
GUSA Senator Bora Balçay (SFS ’23), who introduced the restructuring referendum last fall, believes students will be more receptive to internal reforms.  
“There is a great deal more work to be done and internal reforms aren’t enough to overhaul the institution but this is a great place to start,” Balçay wrote to The Hoya. 
Although GUSA President-elect Kole Wolfe (SFS ’24) and Vice President-elect Zeke Ume-Ukeje (COL ’24) will take over the GUSA executive soon, the new administration will not impact work being done to reform the organization, according to Balçay.  
“Every new executive presents a certain challenge to the established working relationship. But I am optimistic that the work for restructure will continue unhindered and that we will have a concrete proposal fairly soon,” Balçay wrote.“I think there is a particular appetite for changing the institution now more than ever given the controversy surrounding the last election.” 
At a meeting of the GUSA senate held earlier this month, senators debated for over two hours over whether to certify Wolfe and Ume-Ukeje’s victory after they were accused of exchanging alcohol for votes. Wolfe denied these allegations at the meeting. 
To be successful, future restructuring attempts must listen to the demands of the student body, according to Flores. 
“Surely, amendments to our bylaws can only do so much and we still need to reconsider the merits of an entire restructure project, especially as the distinction between the executive and senate becomes more of a blur,” Flores wrote. “However, this also means that we need to restructure correctly and actively engage with the student body throughout the process.”

This is precisely why a Constitutional Council is needed (or perhaps better reading comprehension among Senators).  The GUSA Constitution threshold for amendments requires a 25% YES vote by the student body (and that yes vote must be in the majority).  So if there was, e.g., a 30% turnout and 75% of voters voted yes, the amendment would still not pass because only 22.5% of the student body voted yes.  The reason for the high threshold is to make sure potentially major structural reforms get the buy-in of at least a quarter of the student body.  Otherwise, major changes could pass with only slightly over 12.5% of the student body voting yes.

Do away with all democratic processes and parliamentary procedure? What do you do then, just beat up anyone that is making a point you don’t like. Who is running this thing now and why?

The Georgetown Mutual Aid Network (GU Mutual Aid) faces continued difficulty fulfilling donation requests as fundraising from campus community members dwindles. 
After its creation in August 2020 by Megan Huynh (NHS ’22) and Binqi Chen (NHS ’22), GU Mutual Aid has distributed $173,703.42 through Venmo to provide grassroots financial support to over 2,500 students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently however, the organizers have been forced to shut down the donation request form within days of its opening, including one instance where the form was closed over a two week period from  Jan. to Feb. and another time earlier in January, when the form was closed within one day of its opening. The shutting down of the form has been due to high demand and a lack of available funds. 
Chen believes donations have slowed because students no longer believe people are experiencing pandemic-related economic struggles.  
“For many people, their lives have returned to some level of normalcy since two years ago, and I think that to them, they are no longer struggling with the pandemic and they don’t see a need to give back,” Chen said in an interview with The Hoya. “People are getting fatigued and tired of donating.” 
While it typically takes around a week to bring GU Mutual Aid’s Venmo balance up to $1,500, its typical target balance to open its request form, it has recently taken three to four weeks to reach that amount, Huynh said. 
Additionally, GU Mutual Aid has been forced to close the form only two to three hours after reopening it, according to Huynh. 
“We just got overloaded with requests and didn’t have enough money to fund all of them,” Huynh said. “It’s just been taking us a lot longer to hit our fundraising goals and fulfill those requests.”
According to Chen, they now receive over 50 requests an hour when their form is open.
Huynh said the increase in requests may be due to backups caused by the closure of the request form.  
“I don’t know if it’s because we are getting a larger quantity of requests or if it’s those requests have been building up over the past month that we’ve been closed,” Huynh said. “This is probably the worst it’s been.” 
This is not the first time the group has struggled to keep their request form open. Last fall, GU Mutual Aid faced challenges meeting demand while adjusting to an increase in requests when students returned to in-person instruction for the first time since 2020. 
To increase donations, GU Mutual Aid recently partnered with The Corp, a student-run nonprofit, during the organization’s week-long 50th Anniversary celebration to host an open mic night fundraising event Feb. 15 at The Corp’s Midnight Mug location. 
GU Mutual Aid raised around $500 through selling snacks and ticket sales at the event, according to Huynh.   
The Corp decided to capitalize on its 50th anniversary to direct student attention to the fundraising event, according to The Corp’s Community Engagement Chair Rose Dallimore (SFS ’22).
“We have to incentivize folks to come in and participate in things like this, to really try to highlight the amazing work mutual aid does and support them,” Dallimore said in an interview with The Hoya. 
GU Mutual Aid will host other fundraisers with The Corp, including raising money through a new thrift store in the Corp’s Uncommon Grounds location run by Georgetown’s Renewable Energy and Environmental Network, a campus organization promoting environmental activism, according to Huynh.  
Huynh said while some students may not see the importance of GU Mutual Aid they should continue to donate. 
“All these problems, like students facing food insecurity and housing instability and things like that, don’t just magically go away,” Huynh said. “I think it’s important for Georgetown students to recognize that a lot of the time, even $10 to 20 means a lot more to someone else within the community than it does to them.”

CW: This article discusses mass violence in Ukraine. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
The sound of bombs abruptly woke up Katya Sedova’s (GRD ’18) family early Feb. 24 in Kyiv, signalling the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which had been looming for weeks. 
“I’m here before you because my family is still in Ukraine. They indicated they awoke today to the sirens and sounds of air raids, something that Kyiv and many cities in Ukraine have not heard since World War II,” Sedova said at a town hall event Feb. 24. “That experience alone is surreal.” 
Sedova, who is from Ukraine, spoke about her family’s experience and the current crisis facing Ukraine at the event hosted by Georgetown University’s Walsh School of Foreign Service (SFS). 
The Russian military invaded Ukraine, storming the Eastern European country by air, land and sea. The invasion followed years of rising Russian pressure and recent weeks of escalating Russian militarization along its border with Ukraine. Leaders around the world have condemned the invasion, which is rooted in Russia’s history of imperialism.  
The event also featured SFS professors Caitlin Talmadge and Charles Kupchan, and SFS Dean Joel Hellman. 
Following the Russian invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared martial law throughout Ukraine. At least 137 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Wednesday, with heavy artillery and shelling from Russia targeting airports, major cities and military infrastructure. 
Ukrainians will resist the invasion, Sedova said. 
“I want you to understand to what extent Ukrainians will resist. It’s not a hashtag. It is a reality for every Ukrainian, wherever they are in the world,” Sedova said. “Their struggle for sovereignty — for independence — goes back centuries. It is not just an idea. It is something they live and breathe and internalize.” 
The SFS organized the event to show solidarity with Ukraine’s people, Hellman said.
“I thought it was very important for us as a community to come together to show our solidarity for our students who are suffering, to show our solidarity with the people of Ukraine and come together,” Hellman said at the event. 
Kupchan, whose parents are from Ukraine, but no longer live there, believes Russia will take over Ukraine within days. 
“I’m guessing that we will see the Russians in the city center in a few days. And that’s because the Ukrainian military, despite the fighting spirit, is no match for one of the best armies in the world,” Kupchan said at the event. “By suppressing the country’s defenses, there’s effectively clearing the way for a set of tanks and armored columns to come in.” 
The United States must continue to focus on it’s own democratic domestic challenges before getting intertwined with Russia and Ukraine, Kupchan said.
“One of the things I’m most worried about, is that we’re going to be preoccupied with this problem when in some ways the much bigger threat to us as a country is right here at home, solving our domestic problems, getting our political central back to life,” Kupchan said.  “I hope that the preoccupation in Russia does not distract us from that very important domestic agenda.” 
In a pretext to the invasion, Russian President Valdimir Putin spun a conspiracy theory that Ukraine was on a path to nuclear power in an address aired to Russian people on Feb. 21. 00
Talmadge is particularly alarmed by Putin’s discourse on nuclear weapons. 
“He’s really saying that, no, I’m going to do what I want at the conventional level. And if you respond, I may actually turn to my nuclear weapons as a means of getting you to back down,” Talmadge said at the event. “This is a development we’re seeing in quite a few countries in their nuclear arsenals, using nuclear weapons as a shield for conventional aggression.” 
The invasion, however, may backfire due to unpopular support for the move among the Russian people, Talmadge said.  
“It absolutely could be devastating for Putin politically. We’re already seeing evidence of what to me was surprising in terms of Russian domestic protests against this military operation,” Talmadge said. 
As they have in the past Ukranians will persevere, Sedova said. 
“Ukrainians have a long view of history because they’ve had a lot of history and a long struggle. To this moment, they survived Stalin’s Holodomor genocide. They survived Hitler. They survived Stalin’s gulags and resettlements. They survived the Soviet regime,” Sedova said.“And they will survive this, too.”

What is happening in Ukraine today these events had been happening for the past 20+ years, when Putin came into power by bombing his own people – civilian apartments and committing atrocities against the Chechen people. The response from the US, EU and NATO had been just complete silence and welcoming Putin to the summits and holding red carpet meetings for him. This further emboldened Putin who attacked Georgia in 2008 and conquered Abkhazia and Samachablo. What did the Western powers do? Absolutely nothing! Reset by the Obama Administration and warm handshakes by Merkel, total ignorance of the international laws and Putin’s war crimes against the Georgian people. What happened afterwards? Putin invaded Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. What did the Western powers do? Bare minimum of symbolic sanctions that continued to feed Putin’s war machine. Then Syria, use of chemical weapons, more atrocities… What did the Western powers do? Absolutely nothing!
So we are here as a result of Putin’s false perception that he could chew more than he could bite and the 20+ year ignorance from the EU, US and the NATO. Today there is strong response and sanctions that will take the Russian economy back to the 1990s indicators, however it is too late and too little. Ukraine needs the Patriot missiles, S-400s, S-300s, missiles to shoot down airplanes and incoming rockets at much higher altitudes than Stingers could reach, Ukraine needs much more firepower and the ability to control and close its own skies. Lets help Zelensky establish the No Fly Zone! The Biden administration looked weak, but slowly they are starting to wake up and see the true face of evil – Vladimir Putin who is trying to restore the new Russian empire…

“Black Georgetown Remembered” released its 30th anniversary edition containing interviews with Black Georgetown community members. 
The book, which was originally published in 1991, details the vibrant and often underrecognized Black Georgetown community. Through interviews with Georgetown residents as well as with research from historical archives, the book explores Georgetown’s history from the university’s founding in the 18th century to the present. The third edition of the book includes a new chapter containing conversations, portraits, photographs and sketches of residents.   
Inspiration for the new edition came from a documentary by the Georgetown University Press that featured stories of Georgetown’s Black community members, according to Kathleen Lesko, a co-author of the book and a former assistant English professor and program coordinator at Georgetown.
“I decided to do a book to follow up, and at the request of many of the Black Georgetowners who then started flurrying out of their homes and coming to my home and bringing their personal memorabilia, and I realized that the story is much larger and more comprehensive than the original film,” Lesko said in an interview with The Hoya. 
As part of the university’s bicentennial celebration, the documentary entitled, “Black Georgetown Remembered,” was released, containing recollections of the neighborhood’s Black community who stayed in Georgetown despite the region’s history of enslavement and oppressive Jim Crow laws. 
The university has its own ties to slavery after the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus sold 314 enslaved people in 1838 — referred to as the GU272 — to financially sustain the university. 
The documentary focused specifically on the 1940s and 1950s, when the demographic of the neighborhood changed drastically due to gentrification following an influx of predominantly white families and businesses moving to the area. 
Lisa Fager, executive director of the Mount Zion Female Union Band Historic Memorial Park Foundation, a historic cemetery in the Georgetown neighborhood mentioned in the book, said the anniversary edition is a way to highlight the neighborhood’s Black history, especially how cemeteries play a role in it.  
“The 30th anniversary is a great way to actually leverage again Black Georgetown to let people know particularly right now with what we’re experiencing with race and reconciliation and critical race theory. I feel like the cemetery is a great place to talk about facts, learn and unlearn things,” Fager said in an interview with The Hoya. 
The exploration of Black history is critical in understanding the history of the United States, according to Neville Waters (GRD ’91), a sixth-generation Washingtonian and community activist whose family was featured in the book.
Many states have banned the teaching of critical race theory in schools, with opponents of the method citing that it is decisive and equating the theory with Marxism. 
“While it is wonderful to be able to isolate and focus on and highlight Black history, in many ways, Black history is American history,” Waters said in an interview with The Hoya. “You know, it is all tied together. One does not necessarily exist in a vacuum.”
American history has often erased Black history in favor of the stories of white Americans with the mentioning of Black leaders and historical individuals often left out of history books. 
Community members feel a sense of pride seeing their family’s history included in the books, according to Waters, whose own great-great-grandfather, Neville Waters, was included in the book. 
“I can’t imagine that in 1856 for a Black man, I’m sure 84 was not the target age. So here is this man that lives this rich fulfilling life, and for his story to be told, that, if you will, has my DNA in it. So, I am very proud to be able to say those are my people,” Waters said in an interview with The Hoya.  
The historical Waters was a property owner, worked for the federal government and became a leader in the Republican party, according to Waters. 
“Black Georgetown Remembered” enables community members to preserve their heritage, according to Lesko. 
“It is a fight to get the visibility and verification that their community deserves and their heritage deserves,” Lesko said. “And it is on the shoulders of the few who still live there, and they are continuing to go to the public meetings, to the citizens association meetings, to make their voices heard. They are very very determined to preserve their history, and these legacy projects are very important to them, because it is all they have left.”

Students want reusable dinnerware to be used at campus dining locations, according to a survey released by the Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network (GREEN). 
The Feb. 17 survey, conducted by GREEN, a student-run environmental activism club, and released on the club’s Instagram account, showed that 72% of the 139 respondents said they would prefer using reusable dishes and cutlery at Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall, the only dining hall on campus.Only 21.7% of respondents said they would feel unsafe if the dining hall switched to reusable dining ware. Additionally, almost 90% of respondents also said they would use a compost drop off program if it was provided by the university. 
GREEN co-president Brooke Hodge (SFS ’24) said the club decided to conduct the survey to the student body’s opinions about  sustainability. 
“This survey wanted to demonstrate both to the administration and to Leo’s as a whole that this is not just GREEN’s initiative, but it’s a broader sentiment of the student body that they do care about sustainability,” Hodge said in an interview with The Hoya. “This is something they feel strongly about, and it’s not just a small-subset of environmentally and sustainably-minded students.” 
Georgetown originally opted to use disposable dining ware because the COVID-19 pandemic, according to GREEN Zero-Waste team leader Willow Volkert (COL ’25). 
“Before COVID, Georgetown used to have all reusables in the dining hall, and there was post-consumer composting, so all the food waste was put into the compost — so it was actually completely zero waste in the dining hall,” Volkert said in an interview with The Hoya. “But then COVID hit, and public health issued a guidance that we must switch to disposables.”
The university has not provided a clear reason as to why disposable dinnerware is necessary to protect public health, according to Volkert.    
The survey was conducted as part of Zero Waste Wednesdays, a weekly initiative where GREEN members table at the entrance of Leo’s and provide information about sustainability, according to Volkert.  
“For the first week, we just wanted preliminary results,” Volkert said. “We definitely want to do it again this Wednesday, so we have at least 200 or 300 respondents to show there is large student interest behind this.”
The university plans to adjust to reusable dining ware in the coming weeks, according to the university spokesperson. 
“Planning is already underway for a return to reusable serviceware at The Table at Leo’s effective Sunday, March 13, at the same time suspending the use of disposable to-go containers from that location,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Georgetown should model its sustainability policy off of American University, the first urban campus, research university and largest higher education institution in the United States to reach carbon neutral status, according to Volkert
“They have all the policies in line to streamline the process of how to go zero waste and carbon neutral in the Office of Sustainability at American, and we should literally just copy that process, but Georgetown just refuses to do it. I think the main reason is because there is not a large student interest behind it,” Volkert said. 
Hodge is optimistic about the sustainability progress Georgeton has made, including the creation of a new vice president of sustainability last fall. 
“Georgetown is undergoing a much larger transition towards institutionalizing sustainability in the administration,” Hodge said. “I want to emphasize that having a vice president of sustainability is a big deal and not a lot of universities throughout the country have had that.” 
So far, however, Volkert said the university’s lack of response to student sustainability efforts is frustrating. 
“Not only are they not implementing any zero-waste policies, even ones that they had pre-COVID or anything like that, they are refusing to work with student organizations to move towards zero waste,” Volkert said. 
Currently the university offers reusable containers that may be used to take meal to go at Leo’s, as well as enaging with GREEN on Zero Waste efforts, according to the university spokesperson. 
“Hoya Hospitality regularly engages with the Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network (GREEN), especially focusing on Zero Waste efforts like reusable silverware kit handouts and composting awareness,” the spokesperson wrote. 
This article was updated on Feb. 28 to include additional comments from a university spokesperson.

The Georgetown University Graduate Student Government (GradGov) will not sponsor a trip to Israel next month following internal controversy and university intervention. 
This semester, GradGov President Jonah Klempner (GRD ’22, LAW ’22) attempted to organize a trip to Israel across all graduate schools for the first time. Klempner planned the trip through itrek, a New York-based nonprofit that coordinates and subsidizes student-led group trips to Israel. 
Itrek only provides funding for students who apply through certain programs; Klempner hoped to expand access for all students by creating a subsidy program funded by the GradGov budget. 
In early February, however, the university prohibited GradGov from funding a subsidy because Klempner had not gone through the required financial and general vetting and review, according to a university spokesperson. This ban followed pushback from Klempner’s fellow GradGov members, who expressed concerns about cost disparities among trip participants, as well as the destination of the trip itself. 
The itrek trip is still scheduled to take place during spring break but without university or GradGov support. 
Given the limited funding available through itrek, Klempner proposed to the student government’s budget committee that $30,000 of GradGov student activity funds be used to subsidize the trip for students who could not apply to itrek’s STEM and Policy subsidization program, according to an email from GradGov senator Jillian Robins (GRD ’23) to all GradGov Senators, obtained by The Hoya. 
“GradGov Senators, outside the STEM and Policy coverage will get a substantial subsidy from GradGov to help cover the $2,400 dollar cost of the trip,” according to the trip application.
While the application limited the subsidy to GradGov senators, the subsidy actually proposed in the budget would have allowed all students to apply, regardless of relationship to GradGov, Klempner said.
Still, there were concerns over the fact that the trip’s student leaders — including Klempner — would not have to pay as much while other trip participants would, according to Robins, who also represents the Arab studies program.
The four trip leaders, who were recommended by Klempner but ultimately approved by itrek, would plan and lead the trip. This meant that these leaders would receive a subsidy from itrek, according to a document obtained by The Hoya. 
Klempner denied handling GradGov funds or using GradGov funds in an unethical manner after the university pulled funding.
“I never touch money from GradGov or itrek, no GradGov funds were apportioned, and the trip can and will take place without GradGov,” Klempner wrote to The Hoya. “I volunteered and was chosen as an itrek trip leader months before I volunteered and was elected GradGov president.”
Administrators from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) made it clear to GradGov that GradGov funds could not be allocated toward the itrek trip, according to a university spokesperson.
The university ultimately has the final decision on how student organizations manage their funds, according to Alexander Sens, dean of the GSAS.
“It is therefore, just a matter of pure fact, legally, ethically and financially the university’s money, and we have a fiduciary responsibility to oversee the use of that money,” Sens said at a Feb. 18 GradGov meeting. 
The university did not specify the exact errors Klempner committed in the vetting process. 
In addition to the funding structure, students also expressed concerns about the trip’s destination, according to Robins.
“If it were solely for professional development, why does it need to go to Israel? Why does it need to go to an apartheid state?” Robins said. “Why couldn’t it be held in New York or in D.C. or on campus for that reason? There are plenty of opportunities for professional development that would be cheaper and not involving an apartheid state.”
Amnesty International, a human rights non-governmental organization, recently declared Israel to be an apartheid state. Israel commits crimes against humanity and imposes institutionalized discrimination against Palestinians, prevents travel through checkpoints and displaces Palestinians. 
Nooran Alhamdan (GRD ’22), a graduate student in the Arab studies program, said it is important for students to understand the complicated relations of the Israel-Palestine region.
“I know that we’re all students and money is short, and this is something that is normal for a person to want to go on an all-expense-paid trip, but my message to students would be to please do your research,” Alhamdan told The Hoya.
Klempner affirmed at a meeting about the trip that the students who were against the trip were not motivated by antisemitism or bigotry.  
Daniel Schoolenberg (GRD ’22), set to be a leader of the trip alongside Klempner, said that the immersive experience of the trip would be valuable for all students.
“I think everyone will gain an understanding about an extremely important and dynamic part of the world that they wouldn’t be able to get otherwise,” Schoolenberg wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The trip’s educational purposes would align with GradGov’s constitution and would aim to facilitate dialogue and learning among participants, according to Klempner.
“This educational trip which includes leaders, students, and speakers from all faiths and backgrounds, features a series of compassionate dialogues,” Klempner wrote.
This article was updated on Feb. 25 to clarify details about the trip’s application/structure and correct details about Israel’s status as an apartheid state and student concerns about the trip.

This had nothing to do with budgets and everything to do with targeted bigotry toward Israel and an effort to sever ties with the world community in the name of Palestinian solidarity.
“We, a coalition of graduate and undergraduate students at Georgetown University, are pleased to declare that we successfully blocked $30,000 of student funding from financing a trip to Israel with the pro-Israel organization, itrek, and fully cut the trip’s institutional links to Georgetown University and the university’s Graduate Student Government (GradGov), in line with BDS principles of academic boycott.”

Access to virtual resources remains inconsistent for Georgetown University graduate students who miss class because of illness and other concerns, according to a survey conducted by the Georgetown University Graduate Student Government (GradGov). 
The survey, conducted over a three-week period in late fall of 2021 garnered 405 responses and asked graduate students to share responses on topics including class attendance, level of preparedness for returning to in-person learning, availability of class recordings and overall experience with student support during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The survey reported that 53% of graduate students missed class at least once during the fall semester, almost half of which reported the cause to be health issues. Nearly 60% of students  reported feeling between “not at all prepared” and “somewhat prepared” to return after a missed class. 
Results from the survey reveal that the university lacks a standardized policy providing short-term academic resources for students experiencing illnesses such as COVID-19, according to Rio Dennis (GRD, LAW ’25), chair of GradGov’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) committee.
“A majority of students are not trying to take advantage of just skipping class for no reason, and we need to make sure that we have accommodations for that,” Dennis said in an interview with The Hoya. “ARC is only set up to be for long-term accommodations for disabilities and so forth. There’s nothing set up for the students short term, like needing to miss class.”
The Academic Resource Center (ARC), which provides academic support to disabled students and student-athletes, has a formal process for requesting academic accommodations. Students can work with the center and their professors to ensure they have ample virtual resources. 
GradGov hopes that the survey results will urge the university to provide more equitable access to courses as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, Dennis said.
While almost 30% of graduate students reported having access to class recordings without needing to justify their absence to professors, around 15% reported having no access to any virtual resources. Moreover, only 31% of graduate students reported having virtual options available in all of their classes.
Each group across the university determines its own mode of course instruction, according to a Jan. 21 email from University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95).
A lack of resources supporting virtual class attendance incentivizes graduate students to attend class in person despite the health risks posed by COVID-19, according to Rachel Martinez (GRD ’24), a member of the GradGov DEI committee.
“We are still in a place where we shouldn’t be encouraging people to come to class sick, or for any reason that they just absolutely, physically can’t be there. They shouldn’t be punished for that,” Martinez said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Students should have more leniency when it comes to class attendance, according to Dennis.
“For students with a disability, for students with military obligations, for students with different temporary family leave, whether it be funerals or pregnancies or whatever the case may be, just need a lot more leniency, especially with the current attendance policies that are very strict and don’t actually accommodate for any of those things,” Dennis said. 
The university remains committed to ensuring that the learning environment is accessible and inclusive, according to a university spokesperson. 
“We will continue to prioritize the health of our community in all we do, therefore, if students miss class because of COVID-19-related isolation or quarantine it will be handled in a manner consistent with students missing class for illness or other reasons,” the university spokesperson wrote. “To this end, faculty members have been encouraged to accommodate students by making course materials available to students missing classes due to COVID-19-related isolation or quarantine, or other symptoms and illnesses, based upon course content and pedagogy.”
Students’ responses included a notable demand for more transparent and consistent virtual accessibility across the entire university, according to Dennis. 
“It’s not something that’s specific to one program or the other, it was very static across all of the different programs as well for the graduate students. Every school was lacking in this,” Dennis said. “There were some schools that were doing slightly better, and maybe in one area or the other, but no student was feeling like they were amply prepared to return back to class.”

CW: This article references racist statements. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
Students are calling on the Georgetown University Law Center (GULC) to address racism on its campus after a professor referred to a student using an anti-Asian slur. 
Professor Franz Werro used the slur in his class on Feb. 10. In response, the GULC Asian Pacific American Law Students Association (APALSA) and the Georgetown China Law Society (GCLS) co-wrote a letter, which has been signed by over 500 students, addressed to Dean William Treanor, which they subsequently circulated across the GULC community. The letter included a list of action items for university administrators to address Werro’s racist language and protect students. 
In the Feb. 16 letter, APALSA and GCLS condemned Werro’s language and urged the university to allow AAPI students who are uncomfortable remaining in the class to switch into alternative courses. 
“The use of a slur in class erodes the trust students can have in their instructor. When that slur is directed at one student, it is deeply alarming and degrading to all students in the class,” the letter reads. “Students should have the choice not to have to learn from someone who makes them feel lesser.”
The letter also calls on the administration to discipline staff and faculty after reported incidents, create an anonymous complaint channel and hold mandatory implicit bias training at the school.
GULC has been administering implicit bias training for faculty and plans to schedule future discussions on bias with students, according to Treanor. 
Werro’s comments were deeply offensive to the Asian Pacific Islander (API) community, according to Somang Lee (LAW ’24), who signed onto the letter. 
“It hurt not just one student who was on the receiving end of that slur at that time, but also the entire community of API people on campus,” Lee said in an interview with The Hoya.
In a letter to the GULC community, Werro apologized and said he understood the harm his words caused.
“In class on Thursday, I addressed a student using a term that I now understand is a racial slur that has long been used to degrade and diminish Chinese people in particular and people of Asian descent generally,” Werro wrote. “I recognize that my use of that word caused real hurt and pain for many people in the Georgetown community and beyond. I am deeply sorry.” 
Werro, a native French speaker, told The Hoya that he was not aware of the historical context of the English term he had used.
“I used what I thought was the English translation of a term I would have used in French — my mother tongue — and which has no pejorative meaning in that language, such as Frenchman or Englishman,” Werro wrote in a statement to The Hoya. 
Werro also told The Hoya he plans to learn about the history of racism in the United States to create a more supportive learning environment for his students in the future.  
The United States has a long history of anti-Asian racism, stemming from bigotry towards Asian American immigrants who traveled to the United States in the 19th century. Europe also has a history of racism against those of Asian descent, including a jump in hate crimes against those of Asian descent during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The incident is the newest addition in a pattern of racist incidents involving GULC faculty and staff. Last month, GULC placed incoming administrator Ilya Shapiro on administrative leave following his racist and sexist tweets about President Joe Biden’s commitment to nominating a Black woman to the Supreme Court. 
In March 2021, GULC fired Sandra Sellers after she complained about the academic performance of Black students to fellow professor David Batson. The racist remarks were caught on video, and Batson resigned following Sellers’ termination. 
GULC is committed to ensuring an inclusive learning environment for all students, according to GULC Dean William Treanor. 
“Last night I was made aware of an incident yesterday involving a professor using a derogatory term in the classroom that is demeaning and hurtful. This term is a slur with a centuries-long history of harm to Asian people,” Treanor wrote in the email. “As a community of students, staff, and faculty we must take a look at our culture, structure, systems, and processes to ensure that we are a community that fosters respect, equity, and justice.” 
In their letter, APALSA criticized Treanor’s Feb. 11 message for not specifying that the slur was used to address a student and did not include Werro’s name. 
While APALSA wrote that they appreciated Werro’s apology, the group found it insufficient, especially his commitment to learn more about the history of discrimination and bias against Asian Americans.  
“Anti-Asian racism is prevalent globally, including across Europe, and even if Professor Werro was unaware of the world’s history, it is inappropriate for a professor to address a student by their perceived race,” the letter reads. 
GULC is taking steps to create a more inclusive and welcoming campus environment, Treanor told The Hoya.
“The work of creating a truly diverse and inclusive community is an ongoing effort and one to which I am deeply committed,” Treanor wrote. “We are taking a number of important steps to fulfill our goal of building a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive campus environment.” 
Lee hopes GULC administrators will reflect on this incident and finally begin to address systemic issues at the school.
“I hope for the administration to really be listening to the voices of the student affinity groups and acknowledge this as a very long front issue and be willing to continue conversations,” Lee said. “Not just about this incident, but for the years to come.”

Ayfkm? The man didn’t mean it in a derogatory way. This is just reaching for something to be outraged over. GU has gone downhill in recent years.
