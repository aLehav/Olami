At least three Georgetown students were turned away at the polls when they tried to vote in yesterday’s special election for at-large member of the D.C. Council.
The students’ names were not on the list of registered voters, and they did not have the required documents — government ID and proof of residency — for same day registration.
The students were not given a provisional ballot and a chance to prove their residency at a later date, however.
After traveling to her polling place with a group of students from DC Students Speak yesterday afternoon, Sarah Christiano (COL ’13) was unable to cast a ballot.
“I was really upset,” she said. “I just hope it didn’t happen to a lot of other people across the city.”
Christiano later called the D.C. Board of Elections and Ethics to report the incident. The BOEE called her back at about 7 p.m., an hour before the polls closed.
At that point, she did not have time to return to the polling place and pick up her provisional ballot.
“It was even more frustrating to know I should have been able to vote but couldn’t,” she said.
Alice McLaughlin, a public information officer at the District’s BOEE, said that poll workers should have allowed students to cast a ballot and instructed them to return to the BOEE office with the proper identification.
“[After receiving complaints] I called the precinct captain and instructed her that those ballots needed to be cast,” McLaughlin said.
Additionally, the BOEE issued a memo to poll workers outlining the additional forms of ID and proofs of residency that could be accepted.
McLaughlin added that she hoped that students were able to return to their polling places when the issue was resolved. She also encouraged students to report future problems while still at their polling places.
“Whatever kind of problem people have in a polling place … we prefer to be able to resolve issues on the spot,” she said.
Christiano attributed the problem to miscommunication about the voting procedures for special elections.
Scott Stirret (SFS ’13), the chair of DC Students Speak, agreed that the mistakes were due to a misunderstanding but stressed that the effects were still serious.
“I don’t think this a concerted effort to minimize student involvement, but it is an example of how sometimes errors can be made that minimize first time voters’ involvement with the political process,” he said.
Yesterday would have been Christiano’s first time voting in the District. She switched her registration to D.C. two months ago because she felt her vote was more important here.
“I think my vote pulls more weight here,” she said. “If [students] care about our issues then we need to show that we care [by voting],” she said. “We need to go out there and vote to prove we’re committed to Georgetown and D.C.”

Just one day after the Healy Pub proposal got the nod from the GUSA Student Activities Fee Endowment Committee, comments by the administration have brought the project’s feasibility into question.
“It is very unlikely that the university would support moving forward with this proposal,” Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson wrote in an email Wednesday. “As I’ve told the student leaders involved, the university has a well-developed plan to create a new Student Center in the lower level of New South — that is our priority, and that space will certainly include student gathering space.”
The Georgetown University Student Activities Fund Endowment Committee voted to back the Healy Pub and Georgetown Energy solar panel proposals as their primary recommendations at its final meeting Tuesday, following two months of debate.
The plan to install solar panels on 43 university-owned townhouses would receive $170,000, while the remainder of the $3.4 million fund would be spent on the Healy Pub project, according to the committee’s suggestions.
The members also voted on a plan for alternatives in case either of the primary proposals proves to be infeasible. The secondary recommendations back the Social Innovation and Public Service Fund, the New South Student Center proposal, renovations to the second floor of Lauinger Library and an omnibus space fund.
For committee members, the likelihood of the Healy Pub proposal has long been a concern. During debates, many voiced concern about the possibility of securing administrative approval.
“University support for the Healy proposal would always be difficult to achieve, and that was made clear to the Endowment Commission throughout the process,” said Colton Malkerson, committee vice-chair and Georgetown University Student Association Finance and Appropriations Committee chair.
The committee ultimately decided to support the proposal because they said it received strong student support.
“It’s not our place to say no,” committee member Kathleen McCullough (SFS ’12) said before the final vote Tuesday, echoing the sentiments of many of her fellow commissioners.
Their final report has been passed on to the Fin/App committee, which is responsible for creating working groups to develop detailed plans for the implementation of each recommendation. Each group would likely include the project’s advocates, relevant university administrators, alumni and GUSA members. Current SAFE committee members will also be invited to participate. After approval by the GUSA senate, the final proposals will be put to a student body vote via referendum.
“The next step in the process is for the working groups to develop the recommendations to give the administration more tangible facts to go on,” Committee Chair Andrew Curtis (MSB ’11) said. “After all, these proposals have only circulated for a month.”
Chris Pigott (COL ’12), the leader of the on-campus campaign in support of the Healy Pub proposal, said Wednesday that he was aware of the possibility that the university would not support the project.
Committee leaders said they still hope that students will be able to work with the university to move the process forward. They continued to stress the importance of redefining the proposal to deemphasize the pub aspect in order to facilitate approval by the administration.
“We deserve a fair trial,” Pigott said regarding the administrative disapproval. “They have to ultimately come forward and say why. The students deserve to hear it straight from the administration.”
According to the final recommendations of the committee, if the solar energy project turns out to be infeasible, the funds allocated to it would go to an omnibus space fund that could provide money for smaller renovation projects.
“As someone who works with space problems on a daily basis, it would make a huge difference to have a few student spaces renovated,” said McCullough, who represented the General Program Board on the committee.
If the Healy Pub proposal proves infeasible, $1.25 million would go to the SIPS fund and $1.75 million would go to the New South Student Center proposal.
The New South Student Center, described by Olson as the university’s priority, is a plan for a student space in the lower level of New South Hall included in the 2010 Campus Plan. Allocating the remaining money either to the Lauinger library renovation or the omnibus space fund would be left up to the Fin/App working groups’ discretion or student referendum.
While committee members said they liked the fact the library project would produce concrete results within the next couple of years, many questioned whether it was an appropriate use of the money.
“I’d like to have children and grandchildren one day,” committee member Matt Morris (SFS ’14) said. “And I don’t want to have to tell them that I gave that much money to Lauinger Library.”

The Student Activities Commission approved an amendment to its funding guidelines Tuesday that will allow groups to modify their programming schedules during the course of a semester, provided that added events do not require additional funds.
Previously, groups were not permitted to add events to their programming arcs — the detailed outline of planned events they submit at the beginning of the semester — except in the case of unexpected events.
Clubs will now be able to present changes to their programming arcs during the third SAC meeting of each month. Groups must show detailed plans for new events, which will be approved based on the success or failure of an organization’s previous events.
According to the funding guidelines, if groups decide to add events, they must be able to demonstrate their ability to fund them. If a group decides to cut an event, the appropriate amount of money will be withdrawn from its account.
Unpredictable events will continue to be considered separately and are still eligible for allocations from SAC’s contingency fund.
The amendment was proposed by SAC Commissioners Carlos DeLaTorre (COL ’13), Kolby Keo (COL ’14) and Lili Bayer (SFS ’13).
“We still reserve the right to not approve modifications,” DeLaTorre said at the meeting. “We should see it as a privilege for groups to get additional events approved.”
The modification to the funding guidelines was spurred by feedback from SAC’s town hall held April 1. The amendment will be added to SAC’s funding guidelines for the 2011-2012 fiscal year and will be published on SAC’s website.
SAC Commissioner Amanda Lanzillo (SFS ’13) urged that the new policy be used to curtail redundant programming on or around the same day by several student organizations.
The amendment was approved with 10 affirmative votes and two abstentions. Nine out of 12 commissioners’ votes were needed for approval.
Emma Green (COL ’12), treasurer of the Philodemic Society, applauded SAC’s efforts.
“This along with the amendment to change the appeals process are both steps in the right direction. They both allow for more flexibility in ways that are perfectly logical,” she said.
Alex Crane (COL ’12), president of the GU Art Aficionados, said the amendment was an important change.
“While it’s great to ask clubs to look ahead, the previous structure was far too limiting and did not allow for creativity,” she said.
The commission decided to postpone addressing more proposed amendments — including a possible contingency fund through which organizations could be allocated additional funds — until the fall.
“We are definitely under a pressure cooker,” said Koenig, explaining the committee’s decisions to leave some proposals until next semester.

The GUSA Student Activities Fund Endowment Committee voted to back the Healy Pub and Georgetown Energy solar panel proposals as their primary recommendations at its final meeting Tuesday, following two months of debate.
The plan to install solar panels on 43 university-owned townhouses would receive $170,000, while the remainder of the $3.4 million fund would be spent on the Healy Pub project, according to the committee’s suggestions.
The members also voted on a plan for alternatives in case either of the primary proposals proves to be infeasible. The secondary recommendations back the Social Innovation and Public Service Fund, the New South Student Center proposal, renovations to the second floor of Lauinger Library and an omnibus space fund.
“We’re definitely pleased with what the committee ultimately decided,” Chris Pigott (COL ’12), the leader of the on-campus campaign to bring back the Healy Pub, said. “And I think there are some fantastic proposals that could be funded otherwise. Whatever happens, it will benefit Georgetown.”
Georgetown University Student Association Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee will take the committee’s final report and create a working group for each of the primary and secondary proposals to develop more detailed steps for implementing the proposals. Committee members will also have a professional study conducted to determine the feasibility of constructing a pub in the basement of Healy Hall.
Colton Malkerson (COL ’13), committee vice-chairman and GUSA Fin/App chairman, said that Fin/App would meet Wednesday to review the committee’s recommendations and begin forming the working groups. Each group would likely include the project’s advocates, relevant university administrators, alumni and GUSA members. Current SAFE committee members will also be invited to participate.
University Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said he is ready to consider the recommended projects.
“I appreciate the thoughtful work of the Endowment Commission. I look forward to working with them in exploring and understanding the feasibility of the ideas they are proposing,” he wrote in an email.
After approval by the GUSA senate, the final proposals will be put to a student body vote in a referendum.
Although members voted unanimously on the final report, some said they wished the committee could have funded more projects.
“I just think we’re not being creative enough,” committee member Jack Applebaum (COL ’14) said during the debate.
According to the final recommendations of the committee, if the solar energy project turns out to be infeasible, the funds allocated to it would go to an omnibus space fund that could provide money for smaller renovation projects.
“As someone who works with space problems on a daily basis, it would make a huge difference to have a few student spaces renovated,” committee member Kathleen McCullough (SFS ’12), who represents the Georgetown Program Board, said.
If the Healy Pub proposal proves infeasible — a genuine possibility, according to some committee members — $1.25 million would go to the SIPS fund and $1.75 million would go to the New South Student Center proposal, which would help finance a planned student space included in the 2010 Campus Plan.
Allocating the remaining money either the Lauinger library renovation or the omnibus space fund would be left up to the Fin/App working groups’ discretion or student referendum.
While committee members said they liked the fact the library project would produce concrete results within the next couple of years, many questioned whether it was an appropriate use of the money.
“I’d like to have children and grandchildren one day,” committee member Matt Morris (SFS ’14) said. “And I don’t want to have to tell them that I gave that much money to Lauinger Library.”
At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Andrew Curtis (MSB ’11) said that there would be no time allotted for public comment, a decision that some SIPS fund supporters in attendance, as well as some committee members, vehemently disagreed with.
Eventually, Curtis agreed to put the decision to a vote, and the committee voted to let representatives for each proposal in attendance speak briefly one final time.
Proponents of the SIPS fund, the Healy Pub proposal and the New South Student Center spoke in favor of their suggestions.
Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) spoke on behalf of the SIPS fund, countering many of the concerns that committee members raised about the initiative. Gustafson said that the project would not be redundant since the recently established Georgetown Social Entrepreneurship Initiative would not provide funds to students. SIPS advocates were unable to sway the commission, however, as a motion to reconsider the proposal as a primary recommendation failed to pass.
“Although we are disappointed with the outcome and have serious reservations about the process, we are thankful to the commission for their consideration,” SIPS backers Nick Troiano (COL ’12) and Gustafson wrote in a statement after the meeting. “We remain committed to bringing the SIPS Fund to fruition, and look forward to further engaging the student body in our efforts.”
According to Pigott, Healy Pub supporters have already had several meetings with administrators and plan to continue working with them over the summer.
Committee members continued to stress the importance of redefining the proposal to deemphasize the pub aspect in order to facilitate approval by the administration.
“It shouldn’t be us versus the university,” Malkerson said.
Pigott said that, in retrospect, while he would not have altered the proposal, he would have made it clear from the beginning that the plan was not centered on drinking.
“We want to bring back the sense of community,” he said.

As cleanup from last week’s flooding at Washington Harbour continues, a D.C. law firm is filing a $5 million class-action lawsuit against the property’s manager, MRP Realty, on behalf of those affected by the flood.
Gary Mason, an attorney for Mason LLP, and plaintiff Charles Holcomb filed the lawsuit April 20, two days after the flood. Until the flood, Holcomb was a bartender at Farmers and Fishers, a restaurant located in the lower level of the plaza. Holcomb contacted Mason when the restaurant was forced to close, causing him to lose wages.
Their complaint claims MRP Realty was negligent after it failed to raise floodgates that would have protected the properties.
“Defendant [MRP Realty] owed a duty of care to plaintiff to ensure the safe operation of Washington Harbour and to take all necessary measures, including raising the floodgates, to prevent the flooding that occurred on April 18,” the complaint reads. “As a direct and proximate result of defendant’s negligent conduct, defendant has caused plaintiff and members of the Class to suffer and continue to suffer financial and economic loss.”
The water level of the Potomac is usually gauged upstream at Harpers Ferry, W. Va., giving property managers in D.C. 32 to 36 hours to erect the flood gates before flooding becomes a problem. It takes approximately five hours to put the barriers in place and costs about $15,000 to raise them.
“[MRP Realty] have a duty to their tenets and employees to raise these gates and protect them from physical and economic harm,” Mason said. He added that the Washington Harbour property has known to be at risk of flooding since it was built in the 1980s, which is why flood gates were included in the original plan by the architect.
This is the first time the area has experienced such heavy flooding in the 25 years since it was built.
According to the complaint, affected restaurants are likely to lose $20,000 to $40,000 for each day they remain closed because of flooding damages.
Mason said his firm traditionally represents people who suffer economic loss or property damage due to ecological situations.
“As it turns out, we’ve mostly been contacted by people who are wage earners who are losing money,” he said.
Mason added that while the loss of one man’s wages might not warrant a complaint, filing the case as a class-action lawsuit makes it stronger.
“With 100 to 200 people who have lost wages … it becomes viable to pursue,” he said.
Spokeswoman for MRP Realty Julie Chase said that all the tenants have moved back into their residences, and electricity has been restored to the property. There is no official reopening date for the restaurants, but she said that several tenants hope to reopen by Mother’s Day.
Chase declined to comment on the lawsuit and why the flood gates were not up.

Former D.C. Councilmember Vincent Orange won an at-large council seat Tuesday night, beating heavily endorsed Republican Patrick Mara and a field of nine other candidates.
Orange, a Democrat, drew 28.27 percent of the vote in the sparsely attended election, according to the Board of Elections and Ethics website. Mara and Sekou Biddle, who had the endorsement of D.C. Council Chairman Kwame Brown, followed with 25.68 percent and 20.46 percent respectively.
Mara was by far the most popular candidate in Ward 2, which includes Georgetown, winning 46 percent of the vote in the area.
The results are considered unofficial until absentee and provisional ballots are counted over the next 10 days according to the Associated Press. With such a low turnout — unofficial estimates put it at 12.16 percent of registered voters — these votes could prove critical.
The seat ─ one of four at-large seats on the D.C. council ─ was temporarily held by Democrat Biddle after Brown was elected Council Chairman.
