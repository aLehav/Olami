Down Dog Yoga on 1046 Potomac St. was burglarized today while a class was being held.
Two men entered the yoga studio, which is across from Dean & Deluca, this afternoon and stole personal items including cell phones, wallets and bags. The suspects ran out after a teacher noticed them.
The Metropolitan Police Department responded to the incident and are investigating.
