Construction on the new Calcagnini Contemplative Center is on schedule, with an estimated completion date set for fall 2013, according to Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J.
The 55-acre center will house all campus ministry retreats for Georgetown students, faculty and alumni and is located in the Blue Ridge Mountains in Clarke County, Va.
A year after breaking ground, the construction is 30 percent complete, with the outside shell of both the  center’s chapel and dining hall built and construction on the cabins will begin this fall, according to Assistant Vice President of University Facilities Regina Bleck.
According to O’Brien, after a certificate of occupancy is granted that certifies the building’s compliance with building codes, the center can be test run in the fall of 2013 before retreats are formally held beginning in the winter.
“Our hope is to get a certificate of occupancy next summer sometime, but that will be dependent on the winter,” O’Brien said.
If all goes according to plan, all campus ministry retreats will be run at the center by spring 2013.
Arthur Calcagnini (COL ’54) and Nancy Calcagnini gave the primary gift of $17 million to fund the center and are staying informed about the construction progress.
“I’m very much involved and wanted to stay involved in the operation of the center and introduce new programs there, as well as partake in the programs that will be held there,” Arthur Calcagnini said.
Leaders of retreat programs are looking forward to the opportunity to utilize the new facility.
Sean Huang (SFS ’14), a student coordinator for the ESCAPE First Year Experience, said that the center’s location will make retreat travel shorter and facilitate planning logistics.
“We currently hold our retreats at Sheperd’s Spring [Outdoor Ministry Center in Sharpsburg, Md.] … but since it’s not technically ours, we have to keep booking them every year a year in advance for the retreats,” he said. “Right now we have already booked fall [2013] dates with them just in case theCalcagnini Center isn’t open yet.”
He added that the new center will invigorate the ESCAPE program.
“It’s a really powerful statement to how much Georgetown really cares about its students in ways that are not just purely academic.”

Hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc along the Atlantic coast Monday, killing at least 80 and leaving millions without power, but the Washington metropolitan area escaped largely unscathed.
Although D.C. airport and metro services were disrupted, dozens of roads were closed and power was lost in some areas, most city services resumed normal operations by Tuesday or Wednesday.
Around 44,000 of electric service provider Pepco’s D.C. customers lost power, according to company spokesperson Bob Hainey, but more than 90 percent of outages were fixed by Tuesday night and all power was restored by 10 p.m. Wednesday.
District airports were unaffected by power outages, but airlines cancelled all flights on Monday and did not resume service until Tuesday afternoon.
Metro bus and rail services, which were suspended all day Monday and resumed 2 p.m. Tuesday, escaped the water damage that afflicted other cities’ public transportation services.
“There was some minor water infiltration, but we didn’t really have any significant flooding in the stations,” said Philip Stewart, spokesperson for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. “Once the bulk of the storm passed around 5 a.m. Tuesday morning, we had a good idea that we had not sustained any significant damage to the system.”
Though heavy rain caused the Potomac River to rise two or three feet above normal by Wednesday morning, the region did not experience the severe flooding that the National Weather Service had predicted, according to Georgetown Patch.
The hurricane’s effects on area businesses were varied. Some, like Wisemiller’s Grocery and Deli, remained open throughout the hurricane and profited from increased demand.
“We were planning to close at 8 p.m. Monday, but because there were so many customers stocking up on food, we ended up closing at our normal time,” store manager Cesar Lopez said.
Lopez added that the store did not suffer damages.
“The store was fine,” he said. “We weren’t really affected.”
On the other hand, Serendipity 3, a restaurant located at 3150 M St., was one of several businesses in the Georgetown area to block all doors and windows and remain closed to the public on Monday and part of Tuesday.
According to manager Aras Gulle, the restaurant sustained minor damages and experienced about a $10,000 loss in sales revenue.
“There was a little bit of water damage. Our windows are wooden, and so they leak, so we were expecting that [and] planned accordingly,” he said. “We were able to keep damage to a minimum, and there were no broken windows [or] water damage on wood.”
District Department of Transportation spokesperson John Lisle also said that advance preparation for the storm helped minimize damage.
“We had a lot of advance warning of the storm, so one thing we did was to clean the catch basins so that they would be free of leaves or debris,” Lisle said.
Starting the Thursday before the storm, WMATA crews also cleared drainage areas, checked on the status of water pumps and secured train tunnels against potential flooding.
“There are water pumping systems throughout the Metro, so we had crews inspecting them to make sure they were properly working,” Stewart said. “We also [had] sand bags at … places where flooding is sometimes an issue.”
Lisle added that DDOT installed 200 generators at major intersections in case of power outages.
“There are 1,700 signalized intersections in the city and only 200 generators, but we deployed those to the major intersections. A lot of our preparations … also [included] having personnel in place and ready to respond,” he said.
These precautionary measures helped mitigate the impact of power outages, according to Lisle.
“Power outages are obviously disruptive to residents, but most importantly, when power goes out, so do traffic lights, and that causes additional issues,” he said. “We were very fortunate. We had very few traffic lights out for long periods of time.”
Now that regular transportation service has been restored, DDOT’s main focus is dealing with damage to roads caused by standing water, flooding and downed trees, according to Lisle.
“We’re still assessing where trees or wires are down, but I would say we had probably at least a couple dozen roadways that were closed,” Lisle said. “We have crews out now removing downed trees and debris, and that work will probably continue for the rest of the week, which is not unusual after a storm like this.”
Lisle credited community members’ cooperation for the smoothness of emergency operations.
“I think that one of the things that worked really well was that people heeded the warnings to stay inside and to not drive,” Lisle said. “The roadways were, for the most part, free of traffic, which cut down on potential incidents or people getting hurt and freed up the roads for emergency responders. It also made sure that the fire and police departments could respond to storm-related calls rather than going to traffic [accidents].”

Towards the end of practice Wednesday afternoon, the No. 4 Georgetown men’s soccer team (15-2-1, 6-2-0 Big East) separated itself into two teams on the far side of Multi-Sport Field.
Sophomore Tomas Gomez and junior Keon Parsa alternated between the pipes as their teammates individually stepped up to the spot 12 yards from the net and competed to put it past them.
The intent behind the drill was clear: With postseason play now upon them, the Hoyas cannot afford to miss penalty kicks as they did Saturday against Seton Hall.
Although the team eked out a 1-0 win, the Blue and Gray’s two penalty kick miscues could have cost it dearly. Beginning with their Big East tournament quarterfinal against No. 13 St. John’s (10-3-4, 4-3-1 Big East) tomorrow, the staff and players recognize that there will be no such margin for error.
“If you try to make a run in the Big East tournament or NCAA tournament, the further you go, you’re probably going to run into PKs somewhere along the road,” said senior midfielder Ian Christianson, who failed to convert his team’s first kick in the fifteenth minute against the Pirates. “[The coaching staff is] just putting pressure on us in practice so if that time comes, we’ll be more prepared for it.”
By now, Christianson and Head Coach Brian Wiese are more familiar than they would like to be with losing in postseason shootouts. DePaul ended Georgetown’s season that way in the 2009 conference tourney, and North Carolina did the same in the second round of the NCAA tournament the following year.
“The teams you play are too good and the margins are too little to expect that you’re going to just win every one of those games [straight up],“ Wiese said.
Wednesday’s practice represented the team’s first on-ball action since Saturday’s victory, with Hurricane Sandy allowing only for a bit of cardio work early Monday.
Unsurprisingly, the team was not at its sharpest on its first day back, but Wiese and Christianson were confident that as soon as the rust wore off, it would be ready to go.
And the Hoyas will have to be ready, too, with the challenge that lies ahead of them this weekend.
Finishing tied with Connecticut for first in the Blue Division — and thus earning a share of the Big East title — the Hoyas received a bye to the quarterfinals. Their subsequent opponent, though, is hardly a reward.
St. John’s, winner of seven Big East championships under current Head Coach Dave Masur, is the defending tournament champion and historically the best postseason Big East team.
This year’s Red Storm, while only a No. 3 seed in the Red Division, is no slouch, either.
Having resided in the Top 25 the entire season — having reached as high as No. 10 — the Johnnies were undefeated through their first eight contests. A respectable 3-0 shorthanded loss on the road to then-No. 2 UConn ended the streak, but only two one-goal defeats have followed.
Christianson fully understands the threat the visitors will present.
“They like to press — they play very quick,” he said. “We know that it’s going to be a good game. We’re just going to continue to play how we have throughout the season. I don’t think we’re going to change too much, but we’ll definitely respect them when they come [down] here.”
The Blue and Gray’s goal all season has been to reach the semifinals at Red Bull Arena, and though they may now be just a game away, it is a game that they are not daring to look past.
Instead of letting their minds wander to the future, Wiese and his players are focusing on the here and now. And the one common feeling among them does not appear to be one of nervousness but rather of anticipation.
“This is a team that’s ready for the challenge, and I think they’re excited about it,” Wiese said. “There’s no shame in losing any of these games along the way, but it’s an exciting prospect to try to figure out how to advance to the next round.”
Wiese also predicted that the big stage would make the game even more intense.
“[Saturday will be] a great game — it’s a big game. We’ve just got to channel what we’re doing into what we think we need to do to get a result against one of the better teams in the country.”
Kickoff in Georgetown’s quarterfinal game against St. John’s is scheduled for 1 p.m. at North Kehoe Field.

The Georgetown field hockey team (2-17, 0-6 Big East) ended its difficult 2012 campaign on Sunday with a 7-0 defeat at No. 11 Lafayette (15-1, 5-0 Patriot League), closing the year with 13 straight losses.
“Obviously, this season’s results were not what we were expecting,” Head Coach Tiffany Marsh said.
The Hoyas’ first game of the season — a 3-2 win at Appalachian State — appeared to promise good things to come. Another win, however, would not come until two weeks later against St. Louis, a victory that ended up being the last of the season.
Despite their highly disappointing record, Marsh said she was proud of her players and their work this year.
“The girls put out a lot of effort every game, no matter what the score showed,” she said. “This season was really about our girls and our program as a whole.”
That season culminated this past weekend with the Blue and Gray’s trip to Pennsylvania for its final two games of the season against Villanova and Lafayette. And it provided an opportunity for some final team bonding before the team broke up for good.
“The whole weekend in general, the team got to spend a lot of time together, which was great,” Marsh said. “Before Villanova, we went to [senior midfielder] Laura Thistle’s house and [senior midfielder] Kimberly Keating’s house after. It was so nice for the girls to be with friends and family.”
Thistle and Keating are two of the 10 seniors on the squad, which constitutes one of the largest senior classes the field hockey program has ever had.
Marsh went out of her way to extoll the Class of 2013’s contributions to the team.
“We are definitely going to miss our 10 seniors and their past four years of commitment to this team,” Marsh said. “It is time to celebrate their careers.”
With the end of the season, the Hoyas will lose their three captains: Caitlin Hickey, Annie Wilson and Thistle.
“With Annie, Laura and Caitlin, you know what you are going to get every practice and every game,” Marsh said. “They all put so much time and energy into this team.
That leadership helped the team register solid performances throughout the season against nationally ranked teams like Connecticut and Rutgers.
“The way we handled that Connecticut team said a lot about our girls,” Marsh said. “We also did really well in the first half of the Rutgers game. We stepped up during some of our Big East games.”
Then-No. 3 Syracuse was another such case. Despite the Orange’s strengths and successes, the Hoyas were not intimidated.
“In the Syracuse game, we lost by five, but we were able to score two goals against one of the best teams in the country,” Marsh said. “That says a lot. We stepped up and played at a different level of hockey.”
Despite such a disastrous year, Marsh remained upbeat about what is to come, noting that the offseason will be about reflecting on this season’s mishaps and working on establishing consistency.
“We have a lot of great things ahead of us,” Marsh said. “We are going to use what happened this year as a springboard to improving our record and improving where we stand in the Big East. I just keep reminding the younger girls what they have done and what they can do again.”

Rangila may be one of the most popular events on campus — more than 500 students will take part in this year’s show — but very few understand the cultural significance and history of the dances performed.
To those unfamiliar with the event, Rangila might seem like any other entertainment show held in Gaston Hall. Rangila, a Hindi word that roughly translates to “colorful,” consists of 11 dances and various independent acts that draw from the diverse South Asian culture. The 11 dances aren’t just meant to entertain audiences; each comes from a distinct cultural tradition in different parts of South Asia.
Six of those 11 dances stay true to major dance traditions from the Indian subcontinent. The first dance of the show is always Raas, the traditional folk dance form of Vrindavan, a town in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Characterized by the use of dandiya, decorated sticks that dancers click against their partners’, Raas is a flurry of coordinated movements — almost like intricate line dancing, and rhythms build to mirror the fast-paced music.
A featured folk dance that hails from Gujarat, a state in western India, is Garba.
“[Garba] involves a lot of circular movements, hand clapping and formation work,” co-coordinatorNeha Sobti (COL ’13) said. Dancers also typically wear full skirts that dramatically billow and twist around the dancers’ ankles as they spin and rapidly switch directions.
Another traditional number, Folk Dance, comes from Rajasthan. “They use a lot of props and formation work as well. This year, the props are manjira … that are like cymbals for your hands that the girls are going to use,” Sobti said.
Many of these regional dances were part of the celebrations in historical festivals throughout rural India that have maintained their style in modern times. They are as ubiquitous as they were centuries ago, a testament to the vitality and strength of tradition in South Asia.
Not all of the dances are as obscure, however. Bhangra is a well-known form of dance based in the traditional folk celebrations of the Punjab region in north India, which borders Pakistan.
“Bhangra is very energetic, with a lot of jumping and hopping — big moves,” co-coordinator RohanMuralidhar (SFS ’13) said. “There’s Bulldog Bhangra, which is pretty evenly boys and girls and more underclassmen. Senior Bhangra is huge, with about 160 seniors and lasting almost 10 minutes. It’s kind of the culminating event of years of participating and part of the whole senior experience.”
Kathak, a dance also from Uttar Pradesh, has more of a classical influence, with its roots in ancient Indian professional, nomadic storytellers of mythological epics. A very technique-heavy dance, Kathakis not as easy to pick up as many of the other ones in the show, which are primarily folk dances meant for mass participation in villages throughout South Asia during seasonal festivals. It was influenced by temple and ritual dances and later by the Persian techniques brought in by the Mughal royal court.Kathak usually features many skillfully executed chakkars, or turns in place similar to Persian whirling dervishes, which make the dancers’ skirts spread in a large hoop around them.
“Kathak is a dance that we introduced this year because we had a choreographer who, for the first time, we felt could actually teach the intricate dance,” Sobti said. “We also have two audiences to cater to [during the show]. We have a lot of diplomats, VIPs and professors who want to really see that South Asian aspect more, and we have students who like to hear and see a lot of energy.”
“This year, we wanted to add a more classical feel to the event as a whole. It’s otherwise mostly mash-ups of Top-40 songs and Bollywood songs and stuff like that. We had heard that people wanted a more classical feel,” Muralidhar said.
The coordinators made sure to include dances that fuse traditional South Asian dance with more modern or Western styles of dance. Bharathanatyam, a classical Indian dance, is fused with ballet and contemporary dance in the aptly named Classical Fusion. Sobti explained that while somewhat similar to Kathak, Bharathanatyam hails from Tamil Nadu in South India and has an even stronger tie to ancient temple dancing without as much Mughal influence. It features a demi-plie stance in which the knees are always slightly bent, intricate footwork and abhinaya — miming to depict storylines.
Some more recent additions to the 18-year tradition are Salsa Masala and Bollygroove. Salsa Masala is a collaboration of Bollywood with tango and salsa styles — an unexpected combination of two very different styles of dance.
“The two actually complement each other very well. Latin music lends itself well to Bollywood and classical Indian moves, and some of the slower Bollywood songs are great for tango and merengue dancing. Our mix even includes a track where Bhangra overlaps with [Shakira’s] ‘Hips Don’t Lie,’” Smiti Mohan (MSB ’15), one of the Salsa Masala choreographers, said.
Sobti explained that Bollygroove is a collaboration with Groove Theory that has worked differently every year, fusing hip-hop with Bollywood style.
“Bollygroove will surprise audiences this year because we have made it a little more hard-hitting since last year. There is definitely more of a distinctive hip-hop element,” Bollygroove co-choreographer Shantel Jairam (COL ’15) said.
No South Asian repertoire would be complete without spotlighting Bollywood-style dancing. Bollywood is India’s well-known version of Hollywood which frequently features an integration of music, dance and acting that can most closely be compared to Broadway and musical theater.
Bollywood Remix will feature the songs currently popular in South Asia, complete with over-the-top choreographies and sassy dance moves. Old School is a return to the height of Bollywood success.
“It has the cheesy — but still good — Bollywood songs from the ’90s that our parents loved. It’s also split into girls, boys and partner sections,” Muralidhar said.
Rangila stays connected to South Asian culture in other ways as well. Proceeds from the event will go to the Kumarappa Institute of Gram Swaraj
KIGS is a grassroots NGO that focuses on microfinancing and creating sustainable villages in India.
“We’ve had a pretty long history with them, and Rangila started as one of their sole funders,” Muralidhar said. “KIGS focuses on women and children, giving them the tools to have a life. … For the board and for us, we feel like we’re making an actual difference. It’s not like we’re giving the money to some megacorporation and we don’t know where the money is going.”
Though Rangila is based in a strong South Asian tradition, the event allows all students to come together.
“The most important thing is to understand that it’s not just a bunch of people of South Asian backgrounds who are doing this … Actually, probably only 30 percent, — not even, are [South Asian]. It’s a bunch of people enjoying themselves. And I think that’s what people relate to more than anything else — just that pure energy,” Muralidhar said.
Performances are Friday, Nov. 16 and Saturday, Nov. 17 in Gaston Hall. Tickets go on sale Monday, Nov. 12 in Red Square.

The Georgetown University School of Nursing and Health Studies announced a new partnership with Catholic Health Initiatives, the nation’s second-largest Catholic health care system, Oct. 24.
CHI, which provides free clinics, research, education and services for the poor, operates in 19 states through hospitals, long-term care facilities, assisted- and residential-living facilities, nursing colleges, home health agencies and community health-services organizations.
Through the partnership, students enrolled in NHS’s new online Masters program, [email protected], who are also employees of CHI will receive a 12 percent scholarship toward the program. In addition, nurses with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing and those with a Clinical Nurse Leader designation can apply to one of the online program’s four specialties.
According to NHS Dean Martin Iguchi, the new program will help Georgetown broaden its impact on healthcare in the United States through its online product.
“We launched our online master’s program in nursing in March 2011 in order to expand the reach of our campus-based graduate nursing program,” Iguchi said. “Our goal is to educate more advanced nurse leaders who will positively impact the health of their communities.”
In a Georgetown University Medical Center Oct. 24 press release, Kathleen D. Sanford, senior vice president and chief nursing officer at CHI, discussed the motivations behind the affiliation.
“Providing our nurses [with] the opportunity to pursue an advanced nursing degree from the nation’s oldest Catholic, Jesuit university will benefit them as individuals, as well as the patients we serve across our diverse network of clinical sites,” she said.
According to Iguchi, the affiliation will also positively impact the Georgetown graduate nursing program.
“Catholic Health Initiatives has a strong national presence,” he said. “This will further support the diversity of background and professional experience that our students bring to the learning experience in class-based and clinical settings.”
Iguchi added that CHI’s mission is closely aligned with Georgetown’s educational philosophy.
“We are proud of our undergraduate and graduate alumni who build their careers around supporting the common good, caring for the whole person and serving society,” Iguchi said. “We believe that our values-based approach will resonate with nurses at a mission-oriented organization like Catholic Health Initiatives.”

The steering committee of the Georgetown Community Partnership, a body formed out of the university’s 2010 Campus Plan agreement with the surrounding community, convened for the first time Saturday.
According to Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13), president of the Georgetown University Student Association and the university’s student delegate to the committee, the meeting was mainly an opportunity for the constituents to get to know each other and establish objectives.
“We talked about our hopes and goals for the committee [and] established a good discourse … [and] trust within the group,” Gustafson said.
The GCP will be comprised of five working groups, which Gustafson said will begin meeting in November.
Gustafson said that she hopes the working groups — which are concerned with student life, conduct and safety; environmental and landlord issues; transportation and parking; communications and engagement and metrics and data — will begin to produce results this academic year.
GUSA launched an online application for students to join working groups Monday, and submissions were due today.
“If students want to have their voices heard in a long-term, meaningful way, we need to be an active part of the GCP discussions,” Gustafson said.
Both the university and neighborhood groups sent several delegates to the steering committee meeting, which was facilitated by Don Edwards, who has facilitated past discussions related to the 2010 Campus Plan. University attendees included Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, Assistant Vice President for Community Engagement and Strategic Initiatives Lauralyn Lee and Provost Robert Groves. Advisory Neighborhood Commissions 2E and 3D, the Burleith Citizens Association and the Citizens Association of Georgetown also sent delegates.
Both Gustafson and ANC 2E Chair Ron Lewis said that the GCP and its working groups have the potential to effect positive change in town-gown relations.
“I’m really optimistic about the working groups and their success,” Lewis said.
Gustafson stressed the need for creative thinking going forward in order to find appropriate compromises that satisfy all constituents.
“My most important goal with the GCP … [is] to emphasize it is incredibly important to not only be results oriented when talking about off-campus behavior but also to use creative thinking and creative solutions so that every member of our off-campus community feels respected and like they are a legitimate member of the community,” she said.
According to Lewis, the steering committee of the GCP is expected to meet quarterly.

Former and current members of the State Department discussed the future of the United States’ role in Asia in Gaston Hall Thursday afternoon.
The event,“Forging Consensus: U.S.-Asia Policy in the Next Administration,” was organized by the Korea Economic Institute, the School of Foreign Service Asian Studies Program and Georgetown’s Office of the President.
University President John J. DeGioia introduced the panel, which was comprised of Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt Campbell and three of his predecessors — Richard Solomon, Winston Lord and Christopher Hill. The panel was moderated by Georgetown Director of Asian Studies Victor Cha, a former member of the National Security Council.
The discussion focused on the members’ experiences in the State Department, particularly with respect to U.S.-China relations, but panelists also spoke more broadly about their perceptions of the balance of power in Asia.
According to Winston Lord, who was assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs between 1993 and 1997, each of the panelists had worked to bring China into the spotlight, but Campbell has been the most effective at elevating the country’s profile.
“The real challenge of my period as assistant secretary was trying to salvage this relationship,” he said. “I don’t think we could succeed, certainly not in the way Kurt Campbell has succeeded.”
“I … believe that the 21st century will be seen as the Asian-Pacific century,” said Abraham Kim, interim president of the Korea Economic Institute, and panel moderator.
The members all agreed on the importance of cooperation within the United States to maintain its influence abroad.
“Bipartisanship is not just important in election season. It’s important always,” Campbell said.
“If we get our act together politically and economically, that is the single best thing we can do for our China policy and our foreign policy in general,” Lord agreed.
The panelists also emphasized the importance of China’s own domestic policy.
“I think the issues in China are driven by domestic issues in China,” Christopher Hill, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs from 2005 to 2009, said. “It’s not all about us.”
The event concluded with SFS Dean Carroll Lancaster’s presentation of the “Georgetown Asia Award” to Campbell for his service to U.S.-Asia Relations
Ying Sun, a first year student in Georgetown’s new Master’s in Asian Studies Program, said he found the discussion interesting but is not sure how much of it will be applied in U.S. foreign policy.
“I think it’s going to be hard because there are issues within the United States,” she said.
“It’s so obvious that the United States has a lot of a role in Asia,” said Hyeon Young Ro, also a first year student in the Asian studies program.

The October on-campus interviewing rush is winding to a close for seniors, marking the end of one of the busiest times of the year for the Cawley Career Education Center.
According to Executive Director of the Career Education Center Mike Schaub, the career center has helped 4,653 Georgetown students since July — approximately 61 percent of the student body — through individual appointments, workshops, employment panels, networking events and the career fair. Of those who have taken part in career center programs, 64 percent are juniors and seniors, 14 percent are freshmen and sophomores and 22 percent are graduate students, students in the School of Continuing Studies and alumni.
This year is the first that the Career Center has been able to accurately track this data because of a new swipe technology service implemented this semester that counts the number of students who come in.
Career counseling provides guidance for students who need to evaluate their post-graduation options and goals. Employment advisers at the center help students search more effectively for opportunities in their field of interest and create proper resumes.
Andrew Moreno (COL ’13), who is pursuing a career in management consulting, has utilized a variety of the center’s services.
“As a student who was undeclared in the College and had little idea of what to do for careers, the career center’s advising services were particularly valuable for me because they helped me figure out what I wanted to do, the values that are important to me in my work and what career tracks best combine those,” he said. “Through the career fair, information sessions, panels and other events, it is much easier for students … to begin to plan long-term career goals and consider post-graduation plans.”
According to Mike Schaub, the center’s methodology has three main components: building students’ career profiles, educating students about fields that align with their interests and developing a search strategy to find appropriate jobs.
He explained that students often find internship and job opportunities both through on-campus interview opportunities and postings on Hoya Career Connection, an online career services management system. Students who find internships or jobs on their own are likely to have used the center for other resources, such as resume and cover letter assistance or mock interview preparation.
Elyssa Skeirik (SFS ’15), who attended a resume workshop co-sponsored by the Georgetown University College Democrats and the Career Education Center on Oct. 16 said the center has helped her prepare for interviews and update her resume.
“I got a lot of insider tips on how to make a resume professional while still standing out,” she said. “I plan to make an appointment with them to discuss internship opportunities in the future.”
According to Schaub, the center aims to work with students on an individual level.
“Not only do different career paths require specialized services, but each student brings a unique personality and skills profile to the table,” he said. “Our counselors and advisers do their best to customize the self-exploration and search process for each student.”
Despite the center’s resources, students see room for improvement.
“While the Career Education Center is very well connected to finance and consulting interviews, it does not offer as many opportunities for other jobs,” William Kim (SFS ’13), a senior who has used the center, said. “Government and non-profit positions tend to recruit through their own websites as opposed to having on-campus recruiting events, and therefore students may not have as much information on them or are as competitive in applying to those programs.”
Priscila Borba (COL ’13) added that the Career Education Center’s services can be less helpful for students who are starting their job search from scratch.
“I feel like they would be very helpful if you know exactly what you want,” she said. “Come in with a solid foundation to build off of … [otherwise] I feel like that is not the best place to be when you go into the career center.”

Between efforts to unionize dining workers and to end the university’s contract with Adidas, Georgetown Solidarity Committee has been a vocal presence on campus in recent years.
But at GSC meetings, members remain silent while one person talks, wiggling their fingers to agree or making a blocking hand motion to continue the discussion.
As a nonhierarchical, open-membership group of roughly 15 to 20 members, GSC uses consensus-based decision-making tactics to organize.
“Generally, if there is even a single member of the group that has really strong objections, we won’t go forward with it until we figure out a way to alleviate concerns,” GSC member Julia Hubbell (COL ’15) said.
GSC was founded during the 1996-1997 school year. One of its first initiatives was participating in the Guess Jeans campaign, an anti-sweatshop initiative. Students bought a pair of Guess Jeans and then allowed students in Red Square to write messages to the company on the pants. The jeans were then mailed to the Guess corporate headquarters.
Current GSC members have continued to support workers on campus by organizing workers’ breakfasts every Friday at 6:30 a.m. and bi-annual barbecues that are open to workers’ families, friends and the broader campus community.
“That’s to show [the workers] that we really appreciate everything they do on this campus and [that] we really want them to feel like they’re a part of the campus community,” GSC member Erin Riordan (COL ’15) said.
The organization also collaborates with the Center for Social Justice to run an English-as-a-second language program for workers at the university.
But according to Riordan, GSC’s advocacy for social justice issues isn’t contained to Georgetown’s campus.
“I see a lot of injustice happening in D.C. or in the world at large or different things going on that I don’t necessarily agree with,” Riordan said. “GSC is a way that we can really stand up and fight against that.”
Recent endeavors include an attempt to encourage Chipotle Mexican Grill to sign an agreement with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers.
GSC also endorses “Real Food, Real Jobs,” a campaign led by the union of the O’Donovan Hall workers, UNITE HERE that aims to bring just jobs and healthy food into D.C. cafeterias.
This year, GSC members hope to work more closely with the university administration.
“One of the things we would really like to do this semester and through this year is to talk to the university about creating a panel or a committee that brings together students, workers, university officials and Aramark representatives,” Hubbell said. Aramark is the dining service provider contracted by the university to run Leo’s. “Until now, there have been various attempts at committees to solve problems, but none of them have ever had all concerns represented.”
According to Riordan, GSC generally does not plan specific initiatives at the start of each year.
“We’re continuing to host events every single week … but we haven’t done many specific initiatives,” Riordan said. “Those tend to come up as issues [that] are brought to our attention, so a lot of what we do is community based.”
When discussions result in initiatives, members claim specific roles in the project by declaring “bottom line” — which means taking responsibility for a certain task.
“We have individual actors but ultimately, all decisions go back to the group,” Hubbell said.
Members sit on the university’s Advisory Committee on Business Practices, which assists with on-campus endeavors, and the Licensing Oversight Committee, which focuses on off-campus licensing issues.
Hubbell said that GSC has largely been embraced by the university.
“The issues that GSC deals with are very complicated in nature and this means that there are a lot of opinions on them,” Hubbell said. “There are absolutely people on campus who don’t always agree with the positions that we advocate, but the great thing about Georgetown so far is that there hasn’t been any real backlash even when there’s been disagreement.”
GSC member Katerina Downward (SFS ’14) attributed this acceptance to Georgetown’s Jesuit affiliation.
“There has been the underlying will of both GSC members and other people in the community to link these campaigns and these motivations to the broader social justice goals, emblematized and encapsulated in the Jesuit identity,” Downward said.
Current members look to GSC alumni and their initiatives as inspiration for the future of the committee. Riordan said she specifically admires the 2005 Living Wage Campaign as an example of a successful GSC effort.
“Over 26 Georgetown students went on hunger strike, and it was a huge, incredibly impressive and dedicated campaign,” Riordan said. “I definitely personally take a lot of inspiration from that.”
Mike Wilson (COL ’05) was involved with the GSC from 2001 to 2005 and participated in the Living Wage Campaign.
“[It] helped me develop skills in organizing workers and bringing together broad and strong coalitions,” Wilson said. “The experience I gained on that campaign, as well as the networks I built with off-campus organizations, led me to be able to continue with social and economic justice work after I graduated.”
Hubbell said that her involvement with GSC helped her gain a new perspective on social justice issues.
“I have definitely learned an incredible amount,” she said. “You can learn about working conditions in a class, or you can learn about working in the news, but it’s such a different experience to go and talk to a facilities worker on campus and hear about their daily life.”

Peter Prindiville (SFS ’14), who is running uncontested for a seat on Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, was officially introduced at the organization’s monthly meeting Wednesday.
Prindiville is on the ballot to represent single member district 2E 08, which comprises Nevils, Alumni Square, Copley Hall, Harbin Hall, Village C East and Henle Village, as well as the two square blocks between 36th and 37th Streets, between Prospect and O Streets.
Although he is running in an SMD mostly inhabited by university students, he stressed at the meeting that he aims to work for the benefit of the entire community.
“I believe that we should work to make our neighborhood better for all residents, regardless of their age or zip code,” he said at the meeting. “I see my campaign not as a referendum on the university … although many want it to be one. I come rather … with a resolve to work together to make Georgetown better for all.”
Prindiville said that his recent discussions with residents in his district have revealed that there is an appetite for dialogue and political engagement at the local level.
“I have been struck by the desire of [voters] to have a voice in local discussion, a voice many of them feel they have never had,” Prindiville said. “I believe that a consistent engagement of residents will bring their ideas and views into our local political process. It is through dialogue and mutual respect that we reach solutions to common issues.”
Prindiville also identified living conditions in Georgetown student rental properties as a concern that the ANC should address, citing the situation of a student living at the corner of Prospect Street and Bank Alley.
“In addition to severe problems with leaking pipes in his basement bedroom, he was concerned that he could not get out of his house in case of a fire,” Prindiville said of the student. “I think we can all agree that subpar living conditions anywhere are a detriment to the well-being of our community.”
ANC 2E Chair Ron Lewis also spoke at the meeting and addressed the issue of Comcast telecom boxes in public spaces that have been installed on sidewalks without the permission of residents. Installations have reportedly left behind bricks and debris that residents find obtrusive.
“So far, Comcast has not responded to emails,” Lewis said.
Commissioner Tom Birch lamented the detrimental effect of these installations on the neighborhood and the preservation of public spaces.
“Let’s talk about property values, for one thing, in addition to the historical value,” Birch said.
Crime was also on the agenda at the meeting. In the wake of the fatal shooting of Tyronn Garner last Oct. 31 on the 2800 block of M Street, Commissioner Ed Solomon urged residents and business owners to take precautions this Halloween.
“A lot of, I guess we call them ‘bad guys,’ are out there, so please be careful,” Solomon said.
Compared with last year, this Halloween was relatively quiet for Georgetown. The only crime reported in the area last night was a juvenile robbery at 29th and N Streets around 10:30 p.m., according to the Metropolitan Police Department’s Twitter feed.

With the help of a $20 million anonymous donation, the university formally launched the Georgetown Environment Initiative Thursday afternoon.
The initiative aims to promote the interdisciplinary study of the environment across Georgetown’s main, medical and law campuses. Both it and the donation, which was given by an unnamed family affiliated with the university, were announced in an email from University President John J. DeGioia to the campus community Thursday.
According to Vice President for Advancement R. Bartley Moore, $15 million of the gift will be used to compensate and fund the research of three new faculty chairs in fields of environmental science. The remaining $5 million will fund an administrative center that will help coordinate and expand collaborative interdisciplinary research on the environment.
“That will advance one of the university’s principle strategic objects, which is to grow our capacity in sciences through additional investment in people and programs,” Moore said.
According to DeGioia’s email, the gift is the largest contribution made to Georgetown’s capital campaign, “For Generations to Come: The Campaign for Georgetown.” The campaign has raised $935 million — including the $20 million anonymous donation, which was given last month — since its launch in 2006.
“Apart from the great generosity of the gift, in a larger sense, what it means for Georgetown is we are demonstrating our … ability to join the strategic objectives of the institution with the philanthropic objectives of donors to achieve these sorts of significant investments in the growth of the university,” Moore said.
The expansion of Georgetown’s science faculty was one of the capital campaign’s primary goals.
Since 2009, a working group comprising faculty members from all three Georgetown campuses and led by department of biology professor Matthew Hamilton has been developing a plan to bolster the university’s capacity to conduct interdisciplinary environmental research. According to Moore, this group’s recommendations provided the basis for the initiative.
“The faculty … has been in the lead on this project,” he said.
Hamilton is now the chair of the environment initiative.
According to Moore, hiring the three new faculty chairs will take roughly three years, but the donation will be put to immediate use in the form of grants to fund research projects.
“We see this extraordinary gift as an opportunity to become a global leader in this increasingly important area,” DeGioia wrote in his email.

3/5 stars
$$$$
Before dining in Arlington this past weekend, I never considered the land across Key Bridge one of multiple fine culinary options. However, Quarterdeck, a happening crab joint that is a 10-minute walk from the Rosslyn Metro station, proved me wrong.  The restaurant has been serving up fresh Maryland blue crab and other seafood for over 30 years, and I would highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time.
Upon arriving at Quarterdeck, my friends and I took our place in a very long line of guests waiting for seats. We received a table after about 20 minutes but some of those in line with us left before their parties were called. Others complained that their reservations were not taken at the time that they had requested, either.
Styled like the quarterdeck of a ship with wooden walls, blue gingham tablecloths and nautically themed paintings, the restaurant has a rustic charm. Providing both indoor and outdoor seating, Quarterdeck attracts many regular diners from nearby Rosslyn and Arlington neighborhoods — something that, in my opinion, affected both the environment and the service. The noise level was high, though it was not so loud that my friends and I could not carry on our conversation. In fact, I thought that this noise added to the restaurant’s lively, convivial atmosphere. My party did get the impression, however, that the wait staff was more attentive to their regulars. Though our particular waiter was quite friendly and talkative, a good number of servers seemed to ignore some of their tables in favor of others.
The menu offers mainly shellfish dishes but it does provide other options, such as steak, chicken and pizza, for those not interested in trying something from under the sea. The real reason to come to Quarterdeck, though, is the famous Crab Feast. Cooked to order, these steamed blue crabs are prepared with a semi-salty seasoning. You have to work at breaking open the claws and shell with your mallet, but the meat inside is well worth it. Served with butter, the crab is so warm and soft that it melts in your mouth. There are downsides, however, to having the Crab Feast. As stipulated by the menu, all in your party must order it. In other words, you cannot have a different entree if the rest of your table has the feast. Although it is “all you can eat,” no one may take feast leftovers from the restaurant. The meal is also priced at $37.99 per person, which is especially expensive for a group of college sophomores.
Quarterdeck offers soups, salads and sandwiches at more reasonable values — meaning under $10 — but I would still give it three out of five stars even if I hadn’t found my dish so overpriced. Although our waiter let us order the Crab Feast, he did let us know that generally reservations are needed if you are planning to order it. Because we did not order appetizers — because we noticed how much damage the feast would do to our wallets — we became very anxious and hungry during the crabs’ thirty-minute cooking time. We noticed, however, that other parties who did not order the feast, or crab at all for that matter, waited just as long as we did. With the wait to get in, to have our orders taken, to be served and to receive our checks, our dining experience lasted over two-and-a-half hours. Factoring in our travel time from the Hilltop to Arlington, I do not know if we would have thought this process worthwhile if the Crab Feast had not been so tasty.
Quarterdeck’s biggest draw is that it serves fresh Maryland crabs, which is probably among the reasons why it appeals to northern Virginians like me who do not always want to venture over the border for quality seafood. However, because of its mostly unreasonable prices, I would wait until next year’s parents’ weekend to visit this crab shack.

A new student advisory committee to the Office of the Provost will establish a forum for student representatives to communicate academic issues directly with University Provost Robert Groves.
In an Oct. 24 blog post, Groves said that the committee will provide him with an understanding of student needs that he does not get by meeting with administrators.
“One of the great threats to being an effective provost is losing touch with faculty and students at the university,” he wrote in the post. “I think I’d do a better job if I had more regular contact with students so that I’m more informed about their reactions to the challenges and opportunities facing the university.”
Groves reached out to the Georgetown University Student Association and the Georgetown Graduate Student Organization to form a student advisory committee that will comprise approximately 14 representatives split evenly between undergraduate and graduate students.
GUSA representatives lauded Groves’ steps to reach out to the students and facilitate communication.
“This new provost is showing an unprecedented willingness to engage with students that we haven’t seen from this position before,” GUSA Vice President Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) said. “This committee is one of the demonstrations of his commitment.”
The presidents of the university’s four academic councils will occupy four spots on the committee. The remaining spots will be open to all applicants.
“I don’t want just people who are active in everything,” Groves told The Hoya. “I can get in touch with people who are really active. I’ve met with GUSA people a lot … but I’m not in touch with the person who is a little shy, who isn’t in a million activities but has real thoughts about this place.”
Groves said he plans to discuss students’ roles in the university’s initiative to enhance learning with technology and the barriers students face when attempting to take courses in other schools. He also hopes to use the committee to address concerns from the 2012 Student Life Report, which was published in April.
Kohnert-Yount pointed out that the committee will provide an opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students to exchange ideas.
“There are very few forums in which undergraduate and graduate students come together to discuss and share academic experiences,” Kohnert-Yount said. “A lot of undergraduate students are taught by graduate students as [teaching assistants], so I think a lot of our academic experiences and priorities are a lot more in common than we think.”
GSO President Paul Musgrave (GRD ’16) agreed.
“From the [undergraduate] perspective, [it is a way] to better appreciate how the research mission of the university has a claim on university resources,” Musgrave said. “For graduate students, it’s a way to be reminded of what the counter Georgetown institution is.”
Though both Kohnert-Yount and Musgrave identified the use of technology in the classroom as an important topic for discussion, they also said that undergraduate and graduate students would have different priorities.
“An issue that’s really near and dear to a lot of undergraduate students is the availability of cross-school classes and minors,” Kohnert-Yount said.
Meanwhile, Musgrave stressed the importance of strengthening research and teaching resources.
“For doctoral students, research opportunities and maintaining competitive funding package is really important. … For master’s students, a greater opportunity to engage in research and share their research is also really important,” Musgrave said. “The other dimension of being a Ph.D. student is learning how to teach, and the provost can engage with that through technology and education initiatives.”
Groves said that he hopes to reach out to students outside the committee through town hall meetings about issues the committee decides is important. He also plans to teach a class in either math or sociology the next academic year.
In his blog post, Groves also emphasized the committee’s role in providing student input in the development of academic policies.
“A student advisory committee to the provost’s office won’t by itself solve all the problems of the university,” he wrote. “It can, however, increase the odds that decisions at my level will be made with more insight into how students react to the different options facing the university.”

Student veterans and advocates have made strides in the past three years to improve the university’s ability to accommodate student veterans as they transition from military service to life on a college campus.
Georgetown has three main initiatives that provide resources to student veterans on campus: the veterans office coordinator from the Georgetown University Veterans Office, the Georgetown University Student Veterans Association and the Georgetown Veterans Admission Project.
The Georgetown University Veterans Office introduced the full-time position of veterans office coordinator in February 2011 to accommodate the approximately 385 student veterans on campus. The position, currently filled by army veteran David Shearman (SFS ’11), provides current and prospective student veterans with a mentor who will advocate for their needs and serve as a liaison between them and the Department of Veterans Affairs.
“It really started as a result of the student veterans coming together and making this happen, and the university has responded very well to it,” Shearman said of the coordinator position.
Second, the Georgetown University Student Veterans Association — founded in 2008 by BarbaraMujica, a professor in the department of Spanish and Portuguese who was inspired by her son’s service in the Marine Corps — serves as a way for student veterans to connect and advocate for their issues on campus.
After speaking with student veterans and realizing that they lacked any kind of institutional support,Mujica and Director of Special Programs Mary Dluhy organized a committee of university administrators to talk about veterans’ issues.
“From [University President John J.] DeGioia to all the deans, all the program heads, everyone agreed, ‘Yes, this is important. We do want to do this.’ But the issue of veterans wasn’t at the forefront at that point,” Mujica said.
Now, the committee, which includes Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and members of the admissions committee, ROTC and the Academic Resource Center, meets monthly to discuss veteran-specific needs.
“I’ve been at Georgetown for over 30 years, and I’ve never done anything as rewarding as this,” Mujicasaid. “I can see the progress we’re making, and I really love working with these people.”
GUSVA President and former Marine Thomas Gibbons-Neff (COL ’15) said the veterans coordinator and a student association are crucial components of the support system for veterans at Georgetown.
“Georgetown has just a great support structure in place for veterans as far as having David Shearmanin the Veterans Office and a very prevalent veterans community as put on by GUSVA in a really good way to meet veterans and kind of get pushed outside your boundaries,” Gibbons-Neff said. “Everyone just kind of gets along.”
GUSVA Director of Communications Russell Galeti (SFS ’13) said the group builds camaraderie among veterans in both Georgetown and the District and fosters awareness among the broader student body.
“Regardless of their views on the wars … a lot of my classmates are very supportive of the troops and are very interested in our service and our stories,” Galeti said.
Other members of the Georgetown community have shown their support for veterans on campus as well. The athletic department will donate men’s basketball tickets to Georgetown veterans and their guests on Veteran’s Day.
GUSVA will also sponsor events throughout the week of Nov. 12, including a reception for veterans and their families organized by DeGioia, a flag-raising ceremony and a speech by retired Maj. Gen. Andrew Davis of the U.S. Marine Corps.
Gibbons-Neff said the president’s reception is an exciting event for both the veterans and the president’s office.
“It’s the first year that we’re doing it, and coming from the highest office of the university reaching down, it’s great,” he said.
In the future, GUSVA aims to expand its outreach to attract more veterans to campus.
“Georgetown is a really great place for military and veteran students to apply to attend if they can,” Shearman said.
Galeti agreed, citing opportunities available to veterans on Capitol Hill; he currently serves as a legislative fellow for Congresswoman Marcia L. Fudge (D – Ohio) and has been working on issues involving foreign affairs, national security, intelligence and veterans legislation.
The final component of Georgetown veterans’ administrative support system, the Georgetown Veterans Admissions Project was founded spring 2012 by former president of GUSVA Colby Howard (SFS ’12). GVAP aims to attract more undergraduate veterans to Georgetown.
“If you look at the veteran population here at Georgetown, across the university spectrum, we’re extremely graduate heavy,” Howard said.
Future projects include the formation of a resource center for veterans that will be staffed by administrators who understand veteran needs.
“The goal with that is to increase the number of full-time professional staff so that … you can get a little bit more specialization,” Shearman said. “You’d also have a director for the center who can think strategically about … the long-term and the big picture.”
Mujica said regularly working closely with veterans on campus has inspired her.
“What has impressed me so much about the vets is that these are men and women who went into the service to serve, and now they’re out of the service and they’re still serving,” she said.

The number of reported drug violations shot up significantly in October, with six incidents reported between Oct. 1 and Oct 31.
By comparison, the Department of Public Safety reported no drug-related incidents in September and only two in August.
The number of drug violations followed a similar trend last school year, when five occurred in October and only two in September.
The increase in drug violations, which included at least two cases of marijuana smoking and one case of narcotics possession, comes amid a slight overall drop in crime. DPS reported 44 incidents last month, down from 46 in September.
Despite the spike in drug violations, theft composed the majority of reported crimes this month, accounting for 25 of the 46 total incidents. This represents a slight drop from the 29 thefts reported in September. Still, theft has increased 47 percent over last October, when only 17 cases were reported.
Six of this month’s thefts were of bicycles, down from the 11 bicycle thefts in September. Yates Field House was also the target of a rash of five thefts earlier this month, an increase over the two or three that occurred in most of the previous months.
The frequency of alcohol violations remained consistent between September and October, with three incidents reported in both months. But this number was down from last October, when six alcohol violations occurred.

Now that midterm season is behind us, it’s time to return to what’s really important: watching television shows on Netflix. Lucky for you, the temperature is dropping, giving you even less of an incentive to close your laptop and go outside. Now, you can maximize the amount of time you spend staring at the lives of imaginary people who are much better looking than you. I’ve compiled a list of the shows you should either start watching or rewatch, all accessible on your (or your roommate’s or your roommate’s girlfriend’s or whoever’s) Netflix account.
If you’re feeling nostalgic for the late ’90s, both “AllyMcBeal” and “Dawson’s Creek” are currently streaming and are worthy of a look. Callista Flockhart who plays the title character in the former is a young lawyer in Boston looking for love. The latter is about a bunch of attractive but angsty teenagers. Half the fun of watching these shows is seeing now-famous people way back in the day: Portia de Rossi, Jane Krakowski, Lucy Liu, James Marsden and Hayden Panettiere all appear on “Ally McBeal.” One of Ally’s main love interests is Robert Downey Jr., who was in the midst of fighting his drug addiction during filming. (Full disclosure: Robert Downey Jr. is the reason I decided to watch the show. No regrets.) For its part, “Dawson’s Creek” has Katie Holmes, Michelle Williams and Joshua Jackson. I can’t help but laugh when I watch these famous people run around these overwrought but enjoyable dramas.
If, like me, you’re an Aaron Sorkin junkie, check out another ’90s show, the sitcom “Sports Night.” This short-lived series follows a sports news show purposefully similar to ESPN’s SportsCenter as characters deal with the ethical issues of their jobs as well as the entanglements of their love lives — think of it as “The Newsroom”-lite. Stick it out through the first few episodes, which use a jarring laugh track, and you’ll be chuckling along with the witty dialogue, even if Sorkin does let his characters become a little preachy for sports journalists.
I have spent hours and hours of my life watching “Law & Order” on television, and now I do it on Netflix, too: The original series, “Special Victims Unit” and “Criminal Intent” (the weakest of the franchise) are all online. I’m personally hoping that “Law & Order: UK” ends up on the streaming service, too, partially because everything sounds better with a British accent — even mass murder.
Speaking of British things, if you’re an Anglophile, Netflix will take care of all of your needs. There’s the prodigious “Doctor Who,” a show about a handsome, proselytizing, time-traveling alien, and one you should check out if you like sci-fi, wit and absurd situations.
Check out “Skins,” which is also about a bunch of attractive angsty teens and is great if you want to see 14-year-olds who party harder than you ever have. If you’ve somehow missed the cultural phenomenon, immediately start watching “Downton Abbey,” the greatest thing to happen to heartbroken landed aristocrats since “Pride and Prejudice.”
I’ll take a moment to acknowledge how Netflix has allowed me to relive my childhood: “Hey Arnold,”“Spongebob Squarepants,” “Rugrats,” “The Fairly OddParents,” “Danny Phantom,” “X-Men” and a host of other shows are all available to watch instantly. When I’m having a bad day, I tend to go on a Bikini Bottom binge, finding solace in Sandy’s weird dome thing that lets a squirrel be BFFs with a sponge. Oh, the wonders of children’s television.
Netflix is also a wonderful place to catch up on the shows all of your friends are talking about but that you never got into. Critical darlings like “Breaking Bad” and “Mad Men” are on there, but I’d also like to suggest you watch “Once Upon a Time.” It’s about a town in Maine populated by fairytale characters who’ve forgotten their real identities. They’re trapped there for eternity by the evil queen, who has an unexplained grudge against Snow White. The whole show is kind of dark but also pretty campy, which is a weird balance that, to be honest, the show doesn’t pull off particularly well. But, in spite of that, it’s a lot of fun and pretty addictive — I mean, who doesn’t want to see Snow White as an action hero?
Of course, this list is only a start to the suggestions I could give. Almost every TLC show, from my beloved “Say Yes to the Dress” to “DC Cupcake” is available, as are shows I used to love, like “Charmed” and “Brothers and Sisters.” At this point, you’ve probably become a hermit in your dorm room who only leaves to buy more ramen noodles; sorry about that, but at least you can live vicariously through imaginary characters, right?

It’s no secret that Georgetown students like to stay informed about events occurring both on and off campus, constantly checking social media and news websites. Still,Dalvin Butler (COL ’13) thought Georgetown needed something more to help students deal with campus-related issues. Partnering with GUTV, Dalvin created “The Hoya Experience with Dalvin Butler,” a talk show filmed with a live audience and featuring interviews with important members of the student body. Dalvin’s first episode, featuring the Georgetown University Student Association President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and Vice President Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13), was highly entertaining and shows that the program has enormous potential. We sat down with this vibrant campus personality to see what inspired him to talk about the Hoya experience.
How did you get involved with GUTV?
I became involved with GUTV over the summer. I happened to be going up to the fourth floor where the GUTV office is located. I talked to a lady, and I told her I was very interested in having a … show at the time. And I [told her that] I think GUTV needs to do a bit more in terms of talk shows, so I just pitched my talk show idea to her. She seemed [to think] it was a fantastic idea. We contacted the managing director at GUTV, and everything just kind of took on a life of its own after that.
What made you think there was a need for a talk show at Georgetown? 
As you know, “The Hoya Experience with Dalvin Butler” is the only talk show on campus. I thought we needed to be more innovative, and I thought a talk show with an audience particularly would give some life to this campus to talk about some issues. I see “The Hoya Experience” as being a huge party, [but also] as being a provocative talk show that focuses on campus life.  As a senior, I [thought], “Well, everyone’s doing a radio show, or they’re a columnist for The Hoya,” and I wanted to think of something innovative that we don’t have.
Do you draw any inspiration from popular talk show hosts? 
One of my guilty pleasures is watching the “The Wendy Williams Show” as well as “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.”
How do you choose your guests? 
I select my guests based on the climate, by which I mean the level of interest on issues or initiatives that are going on at the time.  Our next guest potentially will be Julian De La Paz (SFS ’15) during our November shoot.  However, we’re also going to be having [Georgetown] Improv Association on. They just had their first show [this past weekend].  I want to be very diverse in terms of the people who I select to come on my show.  That means people from study body government, people from performing arts, people from athletics — to give it a wide range because people’s interests vary.  Although the show appears to be probably more of a student body government show right now, it’s going to transition.
What can we expect for the future of “The Hoya Experience?” 
I see it having a better format, possibly another person acting or maybe a live band.  Those are all things we’re talking about now with some of the producers — how we are going to format it differently for the spring semester [and] what things that we look and see that were flawed in the first season to make it a more lively show for the next semester.

The D.C. A Cappella Festival — abbreviated as DCAF and pronounced like the coffee variety — returns to campus for its 21st year this Saturday. Don’t let the name fool you: The performance will give you goosebumps and a jolt of energy. The Phantoms and the GraceNotes organize the event to showcase some of the most talented and competitive groups in the country. These widely successful groups are known to impress with truly uplifting harmonies and innovative arrangements.
DCAF occurs twice, this Saturday and next Saturday, with Georgetown groups performing on each night.
The GraceNotes, Georgetown’s oldest all-female group, has been singing for over 30 years with special performances at venues like the Kennedy Center and the White House. The co-ed Phantoms have been around for almost 25 years and have also performed at the White House as well as at the State Department and Blair House.
On their respective host nights, the GraceNotes and Phantoms will each perform a special opener and will perform five times by the night’s end. There will also be performances by groups hailing from The George Washington University, Yale University, New York University, University of Connecticut and other Georgetown a cappella groups.
Philip Dearing (SFS ’15), a member of the Phantoms, is very excited.
“The visiting groups change [from] year to year, but the point of the event stays the same: a chance to showcase the great voices of Georgetown and to bring a quality to show the student body [that they will] enjoy,” he said.
DCAF is the premier event of the fall for a cappella groups, and preparation is key leading up to it. Groups spend six to seven hours a week practicing in the days leading up to the event. Both groups prepare new songs, and when asked what musical numbers could be expected, members of both theGraceNotes and the Phantoms were reluctant to spoil the surprise. They did explain that audiences could expect songs from Beyoncé, Jessie J and some music from the ’90s. With a mix of so many different a cappella groups, audiences will hear all sorts of genres, from pop to hip hop to classic hits.
DCAF is a popular event on campus and has been known to sell out quickly. When asked about her favorite part of the event, GraceNotes Musical Director Olivia Benson (NHS ’15) noted the talent of the other performers and the audience’s reactions.
“My favorite part is the feeling you get when you look out on the crowd and can tell how much they are enjoying themselves. We are on stage doing what we love, so the audience’s reaction is always so rewarding,” Benson said.
Performance nights are Nov. 3 and 10, both at 7:30 p.m. in Gaston Hall. Tickets are $8 for Georgetown students and $10 for non-students and can be purchased the weeks of the event in Red Square or at the Davis Performing Arts Center.
