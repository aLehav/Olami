The Student Health Center has lost the trust of many students with frustrating procedures for making appointments and a lack of accessible resources for health crises — a claim that has become a particular concern in the wake of a campus-wide health scare surrounding a case of bacterial meningitis confirmed two weeks ago.
Bacterial meningitis is a disease that requires immediate treatment, as emphasized by the university after meningitis was confirmed on campus, but some students, exhibiting a variety of symptoms in non-related instances over their time at Georgetown, have found that immediate treatment is difficult to attain at the health center.
The Student Health Center advertises walk-in appointments for students with pressing medical needs.
“Students without an appointment and who have urgent problems will be offered an assessment by a nurse or clinician during office hours,” the health center’s website states.
However, students have had difficulties scheduling last-minute appointments at the Student Health Center, even since the meningitis scare.
After feeling sick for over two weeks, Jenna Galper (COL ’17), decided to seek treatment from the Student Health Center last week, only to be faced with a lengthy wait period.
“I was pretty sick. I’d had a pretty bad cough for two weeks and was worried that I might have a fever, but I was on hold for about half an hour and they told me they couldn’t see me for two days,” Galper said.
According to Galper, health center personnel made no attempt to evaluate the severity of her case before turning her away.
“They didn’t actually ask me anything about what I was feeling,” Galper said.
Instead of waiting for an appointment with the Student Health Center, Galper decided to go to a CVS Minute Clinic, where she said she was able to see a doctor and fill a prescription within an hour. Galper said that she would not consider going to the health center in the future.
“I just thought that was kind of ridiculous and I didn’t want to be this sick for another two days,” Galper said. “I didn’t want to mess around with my health, especially given everything that’s happened.”
Jackson Smith (COL ’16) went to the health center about two-and-a-half weeks ago after feeling physically ill for a morning. Smith said that this instance was a recurrent symptom of an ongoing illness, so he decided to go to the health center, but could not get an appointment until late the next day.
“Since at that moment, I wasn’t super sick, they said I couldn’t get an appointment,” Smith said.
Smith said that although he was not exhibiting urgent symptoms while he was at the health center, he felt that it was probable that he would become sicker before his appointment the following day. The health center did not offer him an alternative for immediate treatment.
According to Assistant Vice President for Student Health Services Jim Welsh, the health center is supposed to determine how quickly students get appointments based on the severity of their illnesses.
“The Student Health Center triages appointments with the information they are provided over the phone or in person,” Welsh wrote in an email. “If a convenient same-day appointment is not available and a student wishes to be seen, a nurse will triage the student that day at the Student Health Center and will then recommend a later appointment, schedule a same day appointment that may require staff and physicians to work beyond scheduled hours (overbooking) or recommend an emergency visit in critical situations.”
According to Smith, the health center did not evaluate the severity of his symptoms when he went in to make the appointment.
“They were really pressing, like, ‘If you’re not about to be sick in some way, shape or form, right now, you can leave,’” Smith said.
Smith became ill again over the weekend and opted not to seek treatment from the health center.
“I was deciding whether to go to the Student Health Center or not … but I was like, ‘I’m not going to sit there with the possibility that I might get turned away again,’ so I just went to the hospital,” Smith said.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said that he was not aware of any specific reports from students about difficulty in scheduling appointments.
“With just about every office on campus, you can find students that say, ‘I wanted to get in but they couldn’t see me at the time I wanted,’” Olson said. “I’m not saying there’s never been a complaint, I’m just saying I’m not aware of particular complaints this semester.”
According to Welsh, the health center keeps a large percentage of the day open for urgent issues.
“Appointments are offered out of convenience for students — first to make sure patients can access the Student Health Center when they are sick, and second to allow students who are experiencing an illness to avoid long waits to be seen,” Welsh wrote.
Caroline James (COL ’16) said that she has also had difficulty scheduling timely appointments with the health center on multiple occasions.
One morning during James’s freshman year in 2012, she woke up with severe shoulder pain. When the pain began to limit her from performing everyday activities, she sought an appointment from the Student Health Center.
“It was getting to the point where I couldn’t type. I couldn’t sleep,” James said. “I called the health center, saying, ‘I’m in incapacitating pain, and I can’t even do my schoolwork. When can you see me?’ And they said in three weeks.”
After being unable to schedule an immediate appointment with the health center, James called the physician on call at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital. The physician referred James back to the Student Health Center, and when James explained that she could not get an appointment, the doctor suggested that she take Tylenol.
“I ended up just having to wait it out. I was in pretty bad pain for about a week, and then [the pain] went away on its own. But that was a week that I was struggling,” James said.
According to James, when she called the health center, the person she spoke with did not make an attempt to evaluate the severity of her injury.
“It kind of felt like because it wasn’t an illness, they dismissed it a little bit more, because it was an injury,” James said. “In that case, it didn’t really feel like they asked all the right questions.”
Last year, James tried to schedule an appointment with the health center again when she was experiencing a sore throat.
“My tonsils were really inflamed so I asked to schedule [an appointment] and they said the usual, which is that they could see me in two weeks,” James said.
Since scheduling an appointment over the phone was not successful, James went to the Student Health Center the next day, and was able to be seen by a doctor after about half an hour. James said that although her appointment went well, she tries to avoid going to the health center when she is sick because of her past experiences.
“I try everything I can to not have to go to the health center,” James said. “If I can wait it out, I figure that I should try.”
While James was able to see a doctor when she went into the health center, other students have not had the same experience.
Julian Graham (COL ’17) was unable to be seen for a same-day appointment when he went into the health center last January with a shoulder injury, which turned out to be a strained rotary cuff that he had sustained while playing rugby. He went in on a Monday, and was not able to schedule an appointment until Friday.
“The painfulness of my injury compelled me to take the Friday appointment even though it involved missing a class discussion,” Graham wrote in an email.
Graham had previously experienced a similar situation with the Student Health Center.
Last October, he called the center after injuring his knee, but had to wait over a week for an appointment.
Graham said he was able to receive proper treatment during his appointments, but that he would consider other options before going to the Student Health Center in the future.
“Although the costs are greater, in the future I would go see a private practitioner for anything that wasn’t mundane,” Graham wrote. “The time it take to get an appointment is very inconvenient and potentially detrimental to patients depending on their ailments.”
Jonathan Espinoza (COL ’16) said that he went to the Student Health Center on Aug.22 to schedule an appointment to see a general physician and refill a prescription. Although Espinoza’s concern was not urgent, he said that it was still an inconvenience, as he had to wait almost two weeks to get an appointment.
When Espinoza went to his appointment Sept. 5, he had to wait an additional three hours past his scheduled time to see a doctor.
Phil Dearing (COL ’15), who goes into the Student Health Center a few times a month for allergy shots, said that he’s satisfied with the center and is understanding of the delays that students sometimes face.
“There are [15] employees … that are in charge of taking care of the health and well being of 7,000 undergrads, as well as the law school and the medical school. … Therefore, it’s not unreasonable, if you show up that day, for them to have a ton of people who are also sick and showing up that day,” Dearing said. “They are doing the absolute best they can.”
Smith, however, said that he feels that being unable to schedule a prompt appointment with the health center is a hindrance to students.
“Having to deal with going to the health center and having them turn you away or tell you to come back later just doesn’t seem right,” he said.“Students should be given the top priority.”
Students have made similar complaints in past student media reports about the Student Health Center since its opening in 2003.

One time I showed up at Student Health 30 min before closing on a Thursday and told them I was in intense pain. They said they didn’t have openings until Monday. I told them if I couldn’t see a doctor that afternoon, I was going to go to the emergency room. They again offered an appointment on Monday. I went to the emergency room where they asked why I didn’t go to Student Health.

The Georgetown University Police Department caught six suspects this month using security cameras and LiveSafe, the new mobile application that allows students to send anonymous tips and emergency calls.
According to the GUPD blotter records, there have been 34 incidents of theft or burglary on campus since Aug. 23.
Burglars in the Intercultural Center, Alumni Square and at bike racks outside of Lauinger Library were caught on the closed circuit television security system, while GUPD caught a flasher through the use of LiveSafe, which was rolled out earlier this fall.
“The CCTV system is very good,” Chief of Police Jay Gruber said. “It’s not often it actively captures somebody in the act, when they’re actually doing the crime, but forensically speaking, when we go back and review the video, we see images of the suspects.”
Gruber said that GUPD often utilized the CCTVs and that they have proven to be very effective, especially in the recent bike theft.
“It happens more often than you think,” Gruber said. “We reviewed the video and we saw the suspect who took the bike. … Our communications center personnel were doing virtual patrols, or taking control of the cameras and looking around, and the very next day one of the dispatchers saw the suspect at the Lauinger bike rack. We sent officers up there and we placed him under arrest.”
Since the start of the semester, there have been 34 cases of theft and burglary. Only one of those cases is closed. There have been no violent crimes reported by GUPD this semester.
The apprehended suspects for the burglaries in Alumni Square and the Lauinger bike rack were members of the Georgetown community.
Gruber said that the CCTVs are only in public spaces, preventing infringement on student privacy within dorm halls.
“All the cameras are in public spaces,” Gruber said. “They’re in places where people shouldn’t have an expectation of privacy. We don’t have them in spaces that would be considered private.”
About three weeks ago, GUPD officers arrested a subject reported with LiveSafe. According to Gruber, a female student was studying near the Einstein’s Bagels kiosk inside Regents Hall when a man approached her and asked to use the power socket by her table.
“When she looked up, this individual had his pants down around his ankles, exposing  himself to her,” Gruber said. “She felt uncomfortable making a phone call, so she used the LiveSafe app to text the police communications center with what happened and a description of the suspect.”
Once officers learned of the information from LiveSafe, they immediately dispatched to Regents Hall, identified the suspect and arrested him.
“It’s a real success story,” Gruber said. “We may not have gotten that information quickly, the victim may have felt uncomfortable making a phone call while the guy was there, so the app worked just like we hoped it would.”
Livesafe founder Shy Pahlevani said that the app has contributed to many arrests on college campuses because it provides students with a familiar and user-friendly interface.
“It’s very common [to catch criminals with LiveSafe],” Pahlevani said. “When you give students a medium that they feel comfortable communicating through, messaging through an app, they’re much more likely to be sharing information. We get a high level of tips that come in that lead to arrests.”
LiveSafe is currently utilized in 18 states, but Pahlevani said he hopes to expand to enhance safety in campuses all over the country.
“I’d love to be able to share this with as many campuses as possible,” Pahlevani said. “With the amount of sexual assault incidences going on, we get a lot of tips about that. We’ve seen a lot of adoption of our technology across the country. We’d like to get it to more campuses across the country so that people have more access to tools. Obviously these things can’t stop tragedies, but they can definitely be preventative and they can assist in ways that student networks couldn’t before.”
Alex Feltes (COL ’18) said that the enhancement of technological safety feature on campus makes him feel more secure.
“I feel like having cameras around campus, having closed circuit TV, makes us a safer campus because it helps prevent burglaries and things that could be harmful to both facilities on campus and students as well,” Feltes said.

The District of Colombia’s “yoga tax” will go into effect Oct. 1, slightly raising some fees at Yates Field House, as well as at gyms and yoga studios around the city.
Gyms and fitness studios, including Yates, which were previously exempt from the District’s sales tax, will be subject to D.C.’s 5.75 percent service tax, which will apply to all transactions, including membership fees, guest fees, fitness passes, locker rentals, instructional classes and lessons.
All full-time students currently pay a mandatory $194 fee per semester for use of Yates, included in tuition.
Part-time students can choose to pay this student fee for Yates membership. Faculty and staff pay $462 a year for a single membership and $672 a year for a family membership. According to Yates Director Jim Gilroy, under the new tax, faculty and staff will be required to pay the 5.75 percent sales tax on their membership, which amounts to about $27 a year. This averages out to about 50 cents a week.
Approved in June, the new fee, branded the “yoga tax” by critics, has drawn criticism from the fitness community, which is pushing customers to sign up for gyms before the tax’s implementation.
D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson proposed the tax expansion.
“The income tax rate will be lowered for all businesses, including gyms and yoga studios. The personal income tax rate will be lowered for all of their customers who pay D.C. income taxes. The tax reform package was the recommendation of a blue ribbon commission,” Mendelson wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “The overall package provides relief to District families struggling with the high cost of living, and ensures that tax savings are reinvested into our neighborhood businesses. I know some gyms have said this will hurt business, but a 5.75 percent sales tax on a $100 membership is unlikely to have that effect.”
According to The Washington Post, the tax will raise $5 million every year to offset tax cuts and save taxpayers up to $143 million a year.
Gilroy said that the cost, though minimal, might still deter individuals from exercising at Yates.
“There might be a cumulative effect since everything will be taxed. There may be a point at which individuals just start to say no to some things. Increased cost is a deterrent for most anything,” Gilroy said.
Gyms and fitness centers around D.C. have promoted “beat the tax” programs, encouraging both new and returning customers to sign up or renew their memberships before the tax takes effect. Stroga, a yoga studio in Adams Morgan, is promoting annual membership deals and fitness class packages that customers can buy this month before the tax is implemented. Jeffrey Melvin, general manager at Stroga, said that the program had received mixed reactions from the public.
“There were a couple of bad reviews from it. A couple people were shocked that we were trying to cheat the system when we were only trying to inform people what was going on, give them a way to help themselves,” Melvin said. “We just wanted to get the word out. At the same time, we’ve gotten emails saying, ‘Oh, this is a great idea.’”
Georgetown students who use both Yates and off-campus studios had mixed reactions to the tax.
“I don’t understand how the U.S. and the D.C. government plan on decreasing obesity levels when they are putting a tax on the mechanism to keeping yourself in good shape,” Ileana de la Cruz (COL ’17), who exercises off campus at cycling chain SoulCycle, said.
Marcela Gelhoren (MSB ’18) questioned whether the implementation of the tax would bring any major benefits, but thought that the tax would probably encourage students to exercise at Yates rather than off-campus.
“For me this doesn’t make any difference, since I don’t pay any income taxes. My gym membership will become more expensive and I will get little to no return from that,” Gelhoren said. “Many students don’t have that much money to spend … so if Yates is the cheaper option of all, they will go to Yates.”
For a one-year commitment membership at Washington Sports Club, located at 3222 M St., members pay an initial fee of $49.99 and then an additional $64.99 a month. After three months, this would cost $245, about $50 more than the student semester fee at Yates.
Lydia Hennessey (COL ’18) supports the tax for reasons of financial efficiency, but worries about the effect on health.
“Overall, I think that it’s really hard to argue here because if we have to balance our taxation system, and this a way that this city is doing it, then it is positive. But at the same time, health is so important, and if we do want to combat obesity, that is where you want to start — making affordable means of exercise. Making that more difficult for people to obtain could be a drawback,” Hennessey said. “The only argument that I can see against this is that if you can afford a gym membership, it probably means that you are making a larger income then people who this tax would benefit and this money wouldn’t be affecting your survival.”
Gilroy urged Yates members not to use the tax as an excuse to avoid exercise.
“Fifty cents a week isn’t a lot, and the benefits one receives from regular exercise, for both physical and mental wellness, can make a huge difference in your well-being and quality of life,” Gilroy said.
Other items under the new D.C. sales tax include water delivery services, storage lockers, carpet cleaning, car washes, bowling and billiards.

Nobel Prize winner and economics scholar George Akerlof will join the faculty of the McCourt School of Public Policy in November, the university announced Sept. 23.
Akerlof, who currently serves as a senior resident scholar at the International Monetary Fund, is known for his Nobel Prize-winning article, “The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism,” and as the husband of Janet Yellen, chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
Akerlof said teaching at the McCourt School, rather than in an economics department, will help him present students with a more balanced perspective of economics.
“In economics courses, there is a bias towards only teaching what economics can do. Teaching at public policy school means taking a more balanced approach including both what economics can do and what it can’t do,” Akerlof said.
Akerlof is best known for his work in identifying severe problems that occur in markets due to asymmetric information.
Mark Rom, an assistant dean of the McCourt School and a professor of government and public policy, said that Akerlof will have flexibility in which courses he develops and teaches.
“He can teach whatever he wants, but I assume he will be teaching things that follow his current research interests,” Rom said. “He is a Nobel Prize winner, and there are not many of them. They have made big impact on the profession in the broader world.”
According to Rom, the McCourt School staff is eager to meet with Akerlof and learn from him when he arrives.
Although Akerlof is best known for his Nobel Prize-winning article, he is now writing a book, entitled “Phishing for Phools,” about how the economics of free markets is subject to qualifications. Akerlof said he believes the book will enhance his teaching abilities in his future classes.
“From writing this book, I have a different perspective, and I am looking forward to imparting new perspective on Georgetown students,” Akerlof said.
Rom said that he is excited to work with Akerlof and learn from his knowledge and experience in economics.
“It sounds like he wants to get involved and be a good colleague, and that really reflects on him as a person. … We are thrilled,” Rom said. “You can imagine places where egos might get in the way about who is on the pecking order, but we are uniformly delighted at having him here. He will be valued and loved.”
Akerlof, who is transitioning from his previous position as emeritus faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, said that he expects to work with graduate students at the McCourt School.
“I think it’s going to be quite different from Berkeley because students here will have different goals — it will be quite different from teaching undergraduates because the students are older and have more focused goals,” Akerlof said. “The students at Georgetown have a special spirit and commitment to school and learning, and I find the same thing among the faculty.”
Akerlof attended Yale University and received a doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before teaching at the London School of Economics and UC Berkeley.
Georgetown recently had one other Nobel Prize winner on its faculty. Mario Vargas Llosa, who taught in the Spanish and Portuguese Department, won the Nobel Prize in literature in 2010.
In a statement on the university’s website, McCourt School Dean Edward Montgomery said that Akerlof will help provide a unique perspective on economic topics.
“Dr. Akerlof is one of the most gifted economists of our day, unafraid to take an unconventional approach to studying markets and our economy,” Montgomery said. “We are honored to have him join our school and grateful that our students will have access to one of the most original thinkers in the field of economics.”

The dozen Syrian women who were scheduled to perform the play “Syria: The Trojan Women” on campus last week before the State Department denied their visa applications saw their chances of eventually performing in the United States advance, after receiving their re-entry passes for Jordan, where they are living as refugees.
This document is expected to aid the refugees, who were blocked from entering the United States due to uncertainty about whether they will leave, in obtaining U.S. visas.
“The U.S. consulate in Amman had no reason to suppose that they would even have the ability to return [to Jordan], should they wish to do so. Now … the one issue that represented an immutable barrier to their ability to obtain visas has been removed,” said Jonathan Ginsburg, an immigration lawyer who has been assisting the university with the visa approval process for the refugees.
The Jordanian government changed its policy to refuse the re-entry of refugees without passes while the women were in the midst of the visa application process with the U.S. State Department this summer. The U.S. government is typically unwilling to admit refugees who are not assured of return.
The women received their re-entry passes two days before they had been scheduled to come to Georgetown University on Sept. 19.
“It looks like we will be able to bring them to Georgetown after all. [The re-entry permits] were the stumbling block. It’s very exciting,” Charlotte Eagar, the production’s co-producer, told The Hoya.
In place of the performance last week, the university’s Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics hosted a summit featuring footage from a documentary about the making of the production and a panel discussion featuring regional experts and the show’s producers. Additionally, there was a live video chat with the refugees, who were in Amman.
The refugees will be performing in Switzerland in late October, and obtained their Swiss visas earlier this month.
According to Ginsburg, the Syrian refugees will be able to make the strongest case for their U.S. visas if they re-apply after they return from Switzerland.
“At that point, two things will have changed. First, they will have the permission they need to re-enter Jordan should they depart,” Ginsburg said. “They’ll also have demonstrated by going to Switzerland and returning [to Jordan] that they won’t jump ship at first chance to leave the Middle East.”
The university is currently working with the refugees to prepare their visa applications.
“Probably what we’re going to do is get everything in place to apply for their visas and actually do the application after they get back from Switzerland, which will be late October,” Ambassador Cynthia P. Schneider, a co-founding director of the Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics, said.
Ginsburg said that, despite the State Department’s previous decision regarding the refugees, the women may receive U.S. visas after they reapply.
“I think, realistically, that they do have a chance. It’s a high-profile matter. A lot of people were very disappointed [by the State Department’s decision],” Ginsburg said.
If the women are able to come to Georgetown, they will perform “Syria: The Trojan Women,” as well as participate in a panel discussion. Although the Gonda Theatre, where the show was supposed to take place, is completely booked through the remainder of the school year, Schneider said that she is considering holding the performance in an off-campus theater or in Gaston Hall.
The performance is a part of the Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics’s Myriad Voices: A Cross Cultural Performance Festival, a series that will take place over the course of two years and explore Muslim communities around the world.
According to Schneider, the group of refugees will also stay on campus for about a week.
“They’ll be able to visit classes at Georgetown and interact with the students and faculty,” Schneider said. “It will go beyond the performance. They’ll really become a part of the Georgetown community.”
Schneider said that she is excited about the recent development, as the refugees had been highly anticipating their trip to the United States and were disappointed when their visa applications were denied.
“I think it will really mean the world to them. These women have been through so much,” Schneider said. “They were so looking forward to coming to the United States and being able to tell their stories and tell their dreams for Syria. … To be able to come and to interact and to be present in this place, Georgetown, will be even more meaningful than it would have been if they had come initially.”

Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author Nicholas Kristof spoke to Georgetown students Sunday about his new book, “A Path Appears,” and his experiences with human rights and political issues plaguing our world today. The event, sponsored by the Lecture Fund, took place in the Intercultural Center Auditorium, drawing an audience of about 100 students.
Kristof began the presentation by showing a brief video promotion of his book, which will be turned into a documentary set to premiere next January. Kristof spoke about issues and stories he has encountered throughout his career as a journalist, ranging from education to human trafficking to equality both abroad and in the United States.
Lecture Fund Vice Chair of External Affairs Helen Brosnan (SFS ’16) introduced Kristof and said that each student who reads his columns and novels experiences a moment of inspiration.
“I have this belief that at some point in everyone’s young adult life they go through what I like to call a ‘Kristof Moment,’” Brosnan said. “To me, a ‘Kristof Moment’ is when you read one of Mr. Kristof’s books or read one of his columns and you single-handedly think you can go change the world in 24 hours.”
When talking about the motivation for writing “A Path Appears,” a follow-up book to his 2009 book, “Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide,” Kristof said that he and his co-author and wife Sheryl WuDunn wanted to address inequality throughout the world and give readers tools to help make small changes. The name of the novel is based on a proverb by Chinese scholar Lu Xun, according to Kristof.
“He had this wonderful saying that said, ‘Hope is like a path in the countryside. First, there is nothing, and then because people walk this way again and again, a path appears,’” Kristof said.
Kristof said that he and WuDunn wrote the book in response to questions from readers about how they could help make global change with the resources that they have.
“I think that there are a lot of people who would like to engage in the world in some way, but are worried about corruption or inefficiency or whether anyone really can make a difference in the world. I am just a huge believer that one can,” he said.
Kristof spoke of the many different stories and people he has seen throughout his time in journalism, which he said inspired “A Path Appears.”
“Somebody asked me the other day, ‘What is your favorite story?’ And it’s a little like choosing which one of your kids is your favorite” Kristoff said.
Kristof also spoke about his experience with international and domestic issues of inequality. One particular issue that he mentioned was intestinal worms in school children in African countries. According to Kristof, these worms can be eradicated for a cost of 50 cents a year per child.
“We don’t think of that because in this country, kids don’t have intestinal worms,” Kristof said. “In much of the developing world, kids do, and they become anemic, they are less able to concentrate on their work and are more likely to be sick and be absent from school. But, you can deworm a child for 50 cents a year.”
Kristof also spoke about his motivation to follow stories about social inequality, and said that giving is both altruistic and rewarding.
“There are obviously a lot of altruistic reasons people get engaged, but it’s also kind of clear that there are selfish reasons to be altruistic,” Kristof said. “Or that altruism is a tremendous source of selfish pleasures.”
Before opening the floor up to questions, Kristof spoke about what motivated him to help others by taking risks. He told a story about his father, who was imprisoned in a concentration camp in Yugoslavia. After his eventual release, he took refuge at a Catholic church in Portland, Ore.
“I’m very much a beneficiary of people who took a risk. It didn’t solve a global problem … but was transformative for my dad and ultimately for me,” he said.
A question-and-answer session followed Kristof’s remarks. When asked if there was an experience that shaped his career path, Kristof told a story about meeting two young victims of sex trafficking in Cambodia during a trip early in his career.
“I could not believe this was happening,” he said, “It was really hard to then go from talking to these two vibrant, smart young girls who are imprisoned in a brothel to writing about exchange rates. I came back and hugged my family and I could not get that out of my system so I came back again and again. The things I write about are very much a result of my experience as a reporter in the field.”
The event concluded with a book sale and book signing during which students had the chance to meet Kristof.
David Tian (GRD ’16) attended the event because he follows Kristof’s work and was interested in hearing more.
“I came to Nicholas Kristof’s event today because I have been following his column for a long time and he touches on a lot of issues I’m interested in, like human trafficking,” Tian said. “I think his writing really empowers people to believe in themselves, believe they can make a difference in the world and it was really an honor to see him in person.”

In a bid to increase efficiency, the District of Columbia Circulator will expand its routes, accompanied by a 50 percent fare hike for SmarTrip card users. The additions are accompanied by reductions in Circulator service that particularly affect residents in the Georgetown neighborhood, eliminating service to Union Station from Wisconsin Avenue north of M Street.
Starting in fiscal year 2015, the Circulator will add two new routes: one will tour the National Mall, including the Tidal Basin and Union Station, while the other will connect National Cathedral to McPherson Square. Other changes extend the Rosslyn-Georgetown-Dupont route to U Street and Howard University, which would connect all five Metrorail lines, and the Navy Yard-Union Station route to Eastern Market. By 2024, D.C. Circulator hopes to double the number of bus routes.
To offset the increased cost of the routes, the proposed changes are expected to increase the $1 flat fare to $1.50 for riders using a SmarTrip card and 2 dollars for people paying in cash, higher than Metrobus’ cash fare of $1.75. Another public comment period and hearing on these proposed modifications will precede the implementation of the changes.
After a report released earlier this year concluded that wait times exceeded 15 minutes roughly 20 percent of the time, the demand to increase efficiency led to the creation of Phase I, the D.C. Department of Transportation’s 10-year plan to reduce wait time to 10 minutes by expanding available routes.
“There is already a lot of excitement about some of the routes we are expanding and adding. Right now we are currently in a phase of answering questions of anticipation — when routes will be running — which is dependent on the next steps of receiving public comments and then how quickly we can implement [the plan],” DDOT Project Manager Circe Torruellas said.
Calvin Millien (COL ’16) was undeterred by the price hike.
“At the end of the day, if the Circulator can get me to where I need to go, I’ll take it regardless of the price change,” Millien said.
Pointing to the inconvenience of the change in routes, Kobby Adu-Diawuo (COL ’17), who used the Circulator to commute to his summer internship, was less enthusiastic.
“While the additional routes to the National Cathedral and Mall are great, now that I’m a Georgetown student, the combination of the price and the inconvenience outweigh the benefits of the Circulator,” Adu-Diawuo said.
Sam Wolter (SFS ’16) said that while the price increase was inconvenient, the new routes would be a positive addition.
“I’d be disappointed if the price went up, if there is in an increase in options, especially ones such as the National Mall, I wouldn’t mind too much,” he said. “At the same time though, one of the big rulers of the Circulator is the $1 flat price, you know what to expect. It would take out the convenience.”
Created in 2005 to complement the existing Metrobus and Metrorail systems, the Circulator operates under a public-private partnership between the D.C. Department of Transportation, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, D.C. Surface Transit and the private company First Transit. In 2013, the five routes of the service include 49 buses and carried 5.6 million passengers.
“D.C. Circulator has always been at the forefront of transit innovation and is now recognized throughout the region,” DDOT Acting Director Matthew T. Brown said in a statement.
The DDOT will hold an open house for comment from 6 to 8 p.m. on Oct. 20 at Pinstripes located at 1064 Wisconsin Ave. NW and allow comments on its website starting on Nov. 7.

Research from the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Research Center found that pictorial warnings are more effective at dissuading cigarette usage than messages containing only text, according to a study released on Sept. 14 in “Nicotine and Tobacco Research”.
Spearheaded by Darren Mays, assistant professor of oncology at the Georgetown University Medical Center, the study was done as part of ongoing research conducted by the center in coordination with the American Cancer Society.
“My research focuses on behavioral cancer prevention — how the onset of cancer can be prevented through behavior change, such as preventing tobacco use and helping tobacco users to quit,” Mays said. “It is the public health impact of tobacco use on lung cancer and other diseases that inspired this work.”
The study evaluated the effectiveness of different types of warning labels in motivating smokers to quit. The researchers asked standardized questions about participants’ attitudes toward smoking and then evaluated how different types of pictorial warning messages worked best for people with different attitudes towards smoking. He stressed the importance of message framing, or the way in which the researchers pose their questions in order to elicit a certain kind of response.
“We looked at an idea called message framing for the warnings. When we communicate information about health risks, it can be done two ways — emphasizing either the benefits of changing a risky behavior or the risks of a behavior,” Mays said.
The idea for the study arose from the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which mandated that pictorial warnings cover half of the cigarette pack to show the health risks of smoking.
In addition to the effectiveness of pictorial messages, the study found that gain-framed messages, which emphasized the benefits of not smoking, were most effective for smokers preoccupied with the difficulty of quitting. Loss-framed messages that emphasize the negative effects of smoking, however, appealed most to participants who thought they could quit whenever they wanted.
“These warnings are more effective than text-only warnings for grabbing people’s attention, generating an emotional and cognitive response,and potentially prompting behavior change,” he said.
Though the study focused on the general population and not specifically college students, Mays explained that his research would affect young people beginning to form habits such as smoking.
“Measures to help young smokers quit are key to reducing the risks associated with tobacco use later in life,” he said.
Despite efforts by researchers to enforce these new policies, students who smoke seemed skeptical that targeted messages would significantly change habits.
Clarissa Reichblum (COL ’17), a self-described social smoker, said that she did not think increased warnings on cigarette packages would discourage smokers from smoking
“Honestly nobody who smokes is unaware of the health consequences. I just don’t really care,” she said.
Salma Khamis (SFS ’17) agreed that messages on packages did not dissuade her from smoking.
“It’s not like I don’t know that cigarettes are bad for me, so I’m really not bothered by them,” she said. “I associate a lot of things with having a cigarette — after food, when I’m stressed or when I’m happy.”
Ruby Velasquez (COL ’17), however, said that the change to larger and more targeted pictorial messages displayed on cigarette packages in other countries could be more effective than the current text-based warnings.
“For American cigarette packages, the messages are small and understated so I don’t look at them, but for international cigarettes packages, I look at the warnings more because they have images on them and pictures are more effective,” she said.
Mays acknowledged the varying opinions on smoking but said that he hoped the study and future research from the Lombardi Center would change the future of smoking and people’s willingness to quit.
“This study will be helpful to inform decisions moving forward about what messages to use to optimize their public health impact,” he said.

Facing declining numbers of completed applications, the Peace Corps enacted major reforms to their applications in July to reduce the length of the process and increase transparency throughout the application period.
In addition to allowing applicants to select the countries and programs to which they want to apply, the new process limits the estimated time needed for the application from eight hours to one hour. After submission, applicants receive a date by which applicants can expect a response from the organization. Applications for the current cycle are due today.
“We’re reducing the red tape and bureaucracy our candidates have had to deal with in the past,” Chuck Cascio, the Peace Corps recruiter for Georgetown, wrote in an email. “Adding transparency and specificity to the application and response timeline will provide a higher quality experience for our applicants while ensuring we connect the best possible people with the right projects for them, for us, our host countries and the communities we serve.”
In contrast to the original application, which asked multiple in-depth questions to match skills and experience with a fitting program, the new application is comprised largely of personal questions. Additionally, applicants can now choose up to apply to up to three programs. If they elect not to specify a program, applicants may alternately choose to be sent where help is most needed. Possible volunteer options include advising nongovernmental organizations, assisting with sustainable agriculture, teaching English and working with disadvantaged youths.
Since the creation of the Peace Corps in 1961, all volunteers were sent to programs based on the organization’s discretion. Peace Corps Director Carrie Hessler-Radelet, who took over the position in June, announced the reforms in July as a way to reignite interest in the Peace Corps.
“With our new, shorter application process, we’re seeing record numbers of Americans apply for Peace Corps service,” Hessler-Radelet said in a press release this month. “While the school year may have just begun, I want to make sure college seniors considering the Peace Corps apply as soon as possible so they can secure the volunteer position of their choice and leave for service shortly after graduation.”
Georgetown is the seventh largest producer of Peace Corps volunteers among medium-sized universities. Since 1961, over 900 alumni have served abroad, and the university deployed 27 students in 2013. Cascio said he anticipated that the numbers will increase in this cycle.
“I would expect to see more applications at Georgetown this year because of both Georgetown’s history of producing a high volume of volunteers and the new Peace Corps application process that is faster and allows applicants to choose where they serve,” Cascio wrote.
The Peace Corps’ recruiting efforts on campus include career fairs, informal coffee meetings and office hours every Friday at the Peace Corps headquarters in Washington D.C.
“The Peace Corps and Georgetown University have always had a strong relationship,” Cascio said. 
Assistant Director for Alumni Relations at the Cawley Career Education Center Erin Ferree attributed the high numbers to a strong interest in international affairs from the student population.
“Students and alumni who enter the Peace Corps often have a strong desire to continue acts of service that they began while at Georgetown University or to gain entry-level experience for a career in international development,” Ferree wrote in an email. “There is also high interest in living abroad in the early years after graduation and in representing the United States in cross-cultural settings.”
Zoe Mowl (SFS ’15) applied to the Peace Corps around two weeks before the reforms, but she was still given the option of selecting her top location choices to a recruiter after the reforms were implemented. She also stressed the importance of service to graduates.
“Part of the Jesuit values is ‘Men and Women for Others.’ I think that actually holds true for the student body,” Mowl said.
Mowl selected Kosovo as her number one choice. She outlined the exhaustive format of the old application; for each “yes” or “no” question there were up to 20 new in-depth questions every time she responded “yes.”
In contrast to Mowl’s exhaustive application, Meghan Burns (NHS ’15) applied after the reforms took place and was motivated to apply by the shorter process.
“[The application is] really just the motivational statement and the resume,” she said. “Everything else is just formalities.”
Burns, who chose Guatemala and Belize as her top two countries, noted that the application appeared impersonal.
“I wish there were a little bit more on there just so I could let them get to know me better, but it is an easier application,” she said.

Walk Score, an online neighborhood rating service, launched a new feature this month that maps out crime in major cities, including Washington, D.C. Founded in 2007, the online service rates neighborhoods in the United States, Canada and Australia based on walkability, or proximity to public transit, access to parks and public space, affordable housing and complete streets designed for pedestrians and bicyclists.
The new crime map feature will now grade neighborhoods on the amount of crime within the region, taking into account the severity of the crime and comparing the neighborhood to the city’s crime average. This information is produced for both personal and property crime.
“Our Crime Grade is the first crime rating that is accurate in walkable neighborhoods,” Walk Score Chief Technology Officer Matt Lerner said. “We compute an accurate per capita crime risk for each address.”
Lerner said that unlike conventional crime mapping, the Walk Score crime map produces an accurate perception of danger, reporting the total number of crimes without adjusting for per capita population.
Walk Score thus adjusts the amount of crime in the area for the population living there.
“Walkable neighborhoods are often safer than people think,” Lerner said. “Your per capita risk is lower when there are more people around.”
With the crime map, Walk Score enters an already established market featuring companies like Trulia, which launched its crime map in 2011 and does not use this per capita system, focusing instead on overall crime density.
“We want to show consumers what it is like to actually live somewhere,” Trulia spokesperson Erin Mackey said. “All of our maps give users a sense of what the neighborhood is all about, whether it is the crime rates, local school rating, as well as other local amenities.”
The Metropolitan Police Department also maintains its own crime map. Private crime mapping companies, like Walk Score and Trulia, use information from local police departments as well as from third-party crime reporting services like SpotCrime and CrimeReports.
“Trulia’s crime maps are formatted in line with the data they receive from the various bureaus,” Mackey said.
MPD could not be reached for comment.
Lerner said that he hoped people would take into account information from the walkability index and the crime map when making real estate decisions.
“Crime is one of the top concerns for people looking for a place to live,” Lerner said.
The crime map for the Georgetown neighborhood reveals below-average rates of personal and property crime. There has been an overall decrease in the number of crimes reported over the course of the past year, with theft remaining the most common offense.
Thomas Voreyer (COL ’16) pointed to information released by the Georgetown University Police Department as sufficient to keep him informed.
“The Public Safety Alert emails keep me well briefed on Georgetown and its surrounding areas, and so I can’t say I particularly care to read up on crime ratings of areas I am already familiar with,” he said.
Michael Whelan (COL ’16) agreed that the map seemed less relevant in the Georgetown area, as he tends to value location over crime rates when making off-campus living arrangements as an upperclassmen.
“I value location above all else when choosing where to live,” he said. “I’d even be willing to live in a slightly more dangerous neighborhood if it meant easier access to shops and transportation.”
According to Walk Score, Georgetown is the 25th most walkable neighborhood in Washington, D.C. The crime map named Dupont Circle as the most walkable neighborhood in the District.

Government professor Clyde Wilcox, who has taught at Georgetown’s main campus since 1987, transitioned this year to the School of Foreign Service in Qatar, where he will remain for two years. Wilcox reflected on his experience living in a foreign country for the first time and teaching American politics to students in the Middle East.
What prompted you to move to Qatar?
I’ve been invited to come over here and teach in the past, but my children were still in high school. So now my kids are in college and grown, it’s an interesting challenge to teach students with different backgrounds and to prepare new kinds of classes. It’s the chance to do something different.
What are some differences between the campus [in Qatar] and the campus [in Washington, D.C.]?
Well, we’re all in one building here: it’s only the School of Foreign Service. The students are mostly from the Middle East. … I teach American politics, and so they haven’t really travelled to the United States. Most of them don’t know much about the United States, so it’s a bit of a challenge. One thing that was kind of interesting was that none of the students [have] their photos on Blackboard, because it is a privacy issue for them.
How has your daily routine changed with being over there?
Well, one thing that’s different is that … Sunday is a teaching day and Friday and Saturday is the weekend. They have me living in the Pearl, which is a complex on an artificial island, and so there is a little shuttle bus that comes and picks us up and takes us to campus.
What are some cultural changes you’ve had to make?
I’m teaching religion and politics, a very delicate topic over here. This is a country that has laws against blasphemy and laws against proselytizing — it’s not that I would ever be blaspheming or proselytizing anyway. It’s also a country where there’s one established religion, and there is not much politics [since] it’s a kingdom, no elections. So teaching religion and politics is a bit of a difference — more of a challenge — than it is on the main campus.
What is [Doha] like compared to Washington, D.C.?
Doha is a very hot place. High temperatures are in the 100s, usually, and the low temperatures by now are around 90 degrees at five in the morning. It’s pretty dry, it’s mostly desert.
What do you do in your free time over there?
So far, I’ve been exploring Doha and getting out to the other parts of the country. It’s a pretty small country…It’s a very international campus. I mean, the Georgetown main campus is very international, but this is extremely international, and the faculty and staff and the students are from all over the world. So there’s a lot of learning different cultures.
Would you encourage other faculty members to make the move?
You know, I think that it’s always good to kind of shake up your routine. This is a pretty interesting challenge. I’m enjoying it so far.
What classes are you teaching currently?
I’m doing religion and politics, and interest groups and social movements.
How are those classes different from the ones you taught at [the main campus]?
I’ve taught the interest groups course at Georgetown in the past. I taught a course about politics and the Christian right on the main campus, but I’ve never [taught] just generally religion and politics. Although there are American politics courses, I teach more comparative content over here, because [the students] don’t know much about the U.S., so I have to [say] ‘this is how we’re different from Europe, this is how we’re different from other countries.’ I’m also teaching women and politics in the spring, which I’ve never taught before, but that’s going to be a bit of a challenge.
Are you going to come back to the country to see the World Cup in 2022?
I don’t know. That’s an interesting proposition. I have to tell you, it’s really hot here. I just don’t know how they’re going to be able to manage to have outdoor games in the summer. It’s a very ambitious country; they’re doing a lot of building and construction. They have totally transformed [Doha] in a matter of 10 years. But, in the middle of the summer, it’s 110 degrees in the middle of the day, very humid, and then it cools down to 100 at night. Outdoor soccer seems very challenging.

One of Georgetown’s oldest parking lots, located at 3320 Prospect St. NW across from Café Milano, will soon be replaced by a new retail center called Prospect Place. The current 82-space parking garage will make way for 27,600 feet of retail space; a 101-space parking garage will lie underground.
The Weaver family, who currently owns Prospect Street lot, has hired the Chicago-based real estate development company McCaffery Interests Inc. to reconstruct the lot. The family will exercise full approval of the project and retain ownership of the property.
“The owners of the property, who have owned the property for 100 years, and have been in Georgetown for over 200 years, have wanted to develop the site for a long time. They engaged our company to develop it on their behalf. The Weaver family will maintain 100 percent ownership of the lot,” said Juan Cameron, partner at McCaffrey Interest and senior managing director of development and acquisitions.
The project’s timeline remains to be determined, since McCaffrey Interests still awaits approval on the project plans.
“We still need to go through municipal and community approvals,” Cameron said.
The Advisory Neighborhood Commission for District 2E, which includes Georgetown, discussed the plans for the project in a meeting Sept. 29 and the Old Georgetown Board will have the chance to discuss the plans on Oct. 2.
“We don’t know exactly what they have in mind. All we’ve seen are the press reports. At some point, they will have to get design approval, and then they come to the ANC for design, put it on our agenda and then we will know a lot more about it,” ANC Chair for District 2E Ron Lewis said.
Georgetown students were excited about the new retail options, the increased shopping opportunities and the employment opportunities.
“Although there are already so many stores in Georgetown, I think it will be a positive impact to have more, and it will be convenient to have many stores centralized together. Opening more stores will also benefit the greater community by providing more job opportunities,” Kathryn Coughlin (COL ’18) said.
Rachel Morota (SFS ’17) said that she hoped to see more affordable shopping options at the retail complex.
“I think it depends on what retail store opens. … Georgetown’s shops are very expensive right now. Apart from H&M, almost anything on M Street is ridiculously expensive, especially since this is a student town. If the shops that open in this new retail store are more affordable to regular people who don’t shop at J. Crew, then I think that there will be a definite influx of Georgetown students that will be shopping there,” she said.
Surrounding restaurants, including Mai Thai and Café Milano, could not be reached for comment.
