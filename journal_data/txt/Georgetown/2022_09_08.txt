Makeup and skincare brand Glossier launched its first Washington, D.C. location in the Georgetown neighborhood. 
The women-owned brand opened its two-story shop on M Street on July 29, and was greeted by a long line of customers. The Georgetown location is the company’s fifth storefront, following openings in Seattle, London, Los Angeles and Miami. The popular makeup brand, founded in 2014 by beauty blogger Emily Weiss, aims to create a beauty line that highlights an individual’s natural beauty. The company is now known for its minimalist products that help establish a dewy, glossy look, a beauty trend adored by beauty gurus and everyday shoppers alike.
At Glossier stores, customers can try out Glossier products while immersed in a theme related to the store’s location. From the tropical beach club theme in Miami to mushrooms and greenery in the Seattle store, customers can enjoy an exciting themed experience while they shop.
The D.C. store has a sleek aviation theme, highlighting aspects of the famous Jet Age of the mid-20th century. The theme is a nod to the District’s rich historical structures, including the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum and the world-renowned Union Station.
Olivia Velasquez, a District resident who recently visited the Georgetown store, said she enjoyed the minimalist aesthetic of the store.
“The store design was very unique and I am personally a fan of themed stores, so it was really fun to see all the themed decor,” Velasquez wrote to The Hoya. “I thought the theme was very clean and cool-looking.”
As customers walk into the Georgetown store, they are met with a staircase that mimics the structure of an airport runway, which then leads them up to the main showroom. The modern product showroom on the second floor is filled with airport-style lights, winged seating arrangements and recycled airplane windows used as mirrors to add to the theme of the store. 
Unlike other makeup stores like Sephora and Ulta, where customers pick the products they want from the floor, Glossier stores are set up as showrooms with their products displayed for  sampling. To purchase products, customers can approach sales associates carrying tablets to manage transactions. The order is then sent to the storeroom, from where the product is sent up to the customer via conveyor belt.
The tablet system allows employees to spend more time helping the customers choose products, offering suggestions and providing customers with the information they need. However, it does cause slightly longer wait times as customers wait for their purchased products to travel from the storeroom to the showroom, according to Manya Kodali (SFS ’25), who recently visited the store. 
Velasquez said the allure of the store made her more likely to purchase makeup products in person. 
“I was surprised at how the entrance was built and I liked that it allowed a nice reveal of the store design,” Velasquez said. “I don’t shop for big makeup brands a lot but it was fun to test every product they had available.”
Kodali said she enjoyed the attention to detail given to the customer shopping experience.
“The store had a very modern, positive atmosphere that made shopping fun,” Kodali wrote to The Hoya. “Compared to other beauty stores, it was much cleaner because we tested makeup without ever touching the communal products, which made the experience better.” 
“The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable. I liked being able to check out the moment I wanted to, but waiting in line for the conveyor belt to drop off my items was annoying,” Kodali said.
Nidalia Wolfe, another customer at the store, said the concept and layout of the store made it a pleasant experience to shop for makeup and a welcome addition to Georgetown’s set of shops.
“Over the past few years I’ve heard more about Glossier and have seen it become more popular in the media, and I am glad I got to try a few of their products,” Wolfe said. “It was evident that Glossier put a lot of thought into the design of their store.”

A Georgetown University psychology professor is publishing a book on the use of psychological frameworks to address the challenges of and propose solutions for 21st-century global immigration.
Professor Fathali Moghaddam’s book, titled “Contemporary Immigration: Psychological Perspectives to Address Challenges and Inform Solutions” will be available Sept. 13. In the book, Moghaddam takes a global approach to psychology and explores topics related to immigration, including gentrification, trust between immigrants and host-society authorities, and “crimmigration,” or the ways criminal law enforcement has become a part of immigration law, 
According to Moghaddam, his research arose out of a need to address the pace and breadth of immigration that countries around the world are experiencing and to view these trends through a psychological lens. 
“I see the problem and the challenge of immigration, increasing over the coming decades for a number of reasons,” Moghaddam told The Hoya. “First, demographically, we need more immigrants. Second, these immigrants are going to come from backgrounds, parts of the world where they are dissimilar, rather than similar to the host society. And so that’s going to raise all kinds of issues about the integration of dissimilar others and diversity.”
Moghaddam also said the perceived threat of immigrants from host societies is a core challenge to modern immigration trends, particularly in countries like the United States, where anti-immigrant fervor has become an increasing part of mainstream dialogue over the last ten years.
“We know that perceived threat generally is associated with lower support for human rights,” Moghaddam said. “So this is another angle that psychologists are putting a lot of light on, that when people are threatened, they are less supportive of human rights and civil liberties. My suspicion is that the populist movements we have seen in the United States are in some part, associated with the threats people experience at the moment from dissimilar others.”
The book, however, takes a global approach to the psychology of immigration. Raimundo Schweikart (GRD ’22, GRD ’25), who co-authored a chapter of the book on immigration trends in his home country of Chile and is a doctoral candidate working under Moghaddam, said examining immigration in Latin America, where often immigrantion occurs between neighboring countries, reveals psychological theories that may differ from traditional Western ones.
“One of the main issues that we wanted to highlight in this chapter is that, usually in the Western world, they have some sort of theories related to migration, some assumptions that are specifically but not universally related to migration. For example, that immigrants are usually very different people, which is not the case in Latin America. We wanted to explore the questions: how do traditional theories regarding immigration that we’re developing in the first world work in South America?”, Schweikart said.
Moghaddam said he hopes the book will highlight the ways policy solutions that emphasize commonalities in the human experience can help solve social issues regarding immigration.
“I believe that human beings are actually much more similar than they are different,” Moghaddam said. “And that by celebrating the similarities, and commonalities, we can achieve a much better outcome and celebrate differences.” 
According to Haley Wexelblatt (COL ’24), who took Moghaddam’s introductory psychology course in the Spring 2022 semester, Moghaddam’s approach of applying topics of psychology to larger societal issues offers depth and relevance to modern political trends.
“Professor Moghaddam had us read both traditional introductions to psychology textbooks and his book ‘Great Ideas in Psychology: A Cultural and Historical Introduction’ to explore psychology topics in historical and cultural contexts,” Wexelblatt wrote to The Hoya. “For example, instead of instructing us to simply memorize Freudian theory or Muzafer Sherif’s experiments, Moghaddam challenged us to look at how the psychological factors driving aggression leads to intergroup conflict with relevant political implications.”
Moghaddam said it is important for Georgetown students to integrate topics related to immigration into their curriculum given their position to create tangible solutions to its growing impact, particularly as climate-driven migration becomes more prevalent on a global scale.
“More Georgetown students should be doing projects and studying immigration, because it is such a huge issue in the 21st century,” Moghaddam said. “It’s only going to get larger because global warming is going to force mass migration. It’s something we have to deal with. I think Georgetown students are in the perfect position to really come to grips with this and help us all rethink some of the traditional ways we have dealt with.”

Tourism numbers are on their way back up to pre-pandemic levels, according to a recent report by Destination DC (DDC), the official marketing arm for Washington, D.C.
According to the report, 19.1 million people visited the District in 2021, which is 77.6% of the visitors the District saw in 2019. Domestic travelers made up an overwhelming majority of visitors at 98.4% of total visitors.
The number of overseas visitors jumped by 21% from 2020, which DDC said is likely due to the loosening of travel restrictions, mask mandates and COVID-19 testing regulations, according to DDC.
The District is primarily focused on drawing more international travelers, who typically stay in the city longer and spend more money than domestic visitors, according to DDC. 
“DDC has concentrated on increasing overseas visitation to Washington, DC, especially in top European markets where recovery potential is likely faster,” DDC wrote to The Hoya. “Growing overseas market share through strategic sales and media missions could lead to a greater economic impact for Washington, DC.”
Tourists play a crucial role in the District’s economy, according to DDC. In 2021, D.C. visitors spent $5.4 billion during their trips, a 45% increase in spending since 2020. Visitors also supported 57,933 local jobs in the District’s tourism industry in 2021, a 41% increase since 2020. 
DDC is working to increase business and leisure travel recovery, starting with stronger advertising tactics to draw tourists to the District, according to DDC President and CEO Elliott Ferguson.
“DC’s tourism economy is moving forward, so now our role as a short-term economic development organization is to be aggressive with high-impact advertising, attract more conventions and meetings and win back overseas travelers because of their higher spending potential,” Ferguson wrote in a DDC press release Aug. 30. 
D.C. will also host the MLS’s All-Star Game in 2023, an event that will likely attract more visitors to the district. 
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) said these events will draw attention to the lively culture of the District and attract both domestic and foreign visitors.
“We are very happy to have visitors from across the nation and around the world back in DC,” Bowser said in the DDC press release. “We are going to keep spreading the word that DC is open, and we will keep giving people new ways to enjoy our city — from conferences and concerts, to festivals and 5Ks, and all the other events that bring people together and uplift the values and culture of our community.”
According to DDC, certain obstacles still remain before international tourism in D.C. can fully return to pre-pandemic levels — quarantine requirements in home countries and the relative strength of the U.S. dollar to foreign currencies both affect the numbers of overseas visitors that can be received. 
“What Washington, DC is facing is unfortunately not just specific to DC but the US and major cities as a whole,” DDC wrote. “Health restrictions are also still in place in many countries across the world due to the pandemic. China was Washington, DC’s number one overseas market in 2019 and still requires a quarantine upon return.”
Many in the tourism industry, including President and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association Geoff Freeman, believe tourism in D.C. will recover to its pre-pandemic levels, even if that recovery is slow.
“Travel’s future is promising and bright,” Freeman said in the DDC press release. “With a concerted effort to address today’s headwinds — including slow-to-return business travel and government-induced obstacles for international visitors — we’re confident that Washington, DC and the nation can achieve a full recovery.”
DDC said the D.C. tourism industry remains hard at work, but total overseas tourism to the U.S. will likely not reach 2019 levels until 2025, according to Tourism Economics and MMGY Travel Intelligence. 
Community members can aid in the recovery by welcoming tourists to the District, according to DDC.
“Washingtonians are used to many cultures and languages and are incredibly welcoming,” DDC wrote. “Just like domestic tourists, we appreciate positive interactions with our international community, from simply giving directions or saying hello to teaching them about DC’s storied history, hidden gems and how to find them.”

As a GU alumnus (SFS) and GU adjunct faculty member (destination planning and development) whose business is focused on international sustainable tourism development, I was pleased to see The Hoya cover tourism recovery in Washington, DC. As we saw during the pandemic, when the tourism industry stops, much of the economy also grinds to a halt.  Tourism has direct, indirect, and induced effects on economies, especially in terms of employment and income generation. Thanks for covering this important subject.
Regards,
Scott Wayne, President

Georgetown University campus dining location Epicurean and Company (“Epi’s”) now accepts meal exchanges, which can be applied to the grill, deli and noodle bar stations following feedback from students about increased dining options on campus.
In addition to the expansion of the meal exchange option, Epi’s will also be open from 7 a.m. to 2 a.m., Thursdays through Saturdays, providing students with a late-night meal plan option on weekends. Currently, The Table at Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall, the all-you-can-eat buffet part of the campus’s only dining hall, closes at 8 p.m. Besides Epi’s, no other dining location is open past 10 p.m.
Prior to the changes, Epi’s allowed students to pay with Flex dollars, a tax-free currency included in the meal plan that students can use at various locations across campus. Prior to the shutdown of the university’s campus in the spring of 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Epi’s operated 24 hours, Thursdays through Sundays.
Karis Danner-McDonald (COL ’24), a student who previously lived in Darnall Hall, a residential hall located above Epi’s, said last year she was frustrated over the limited number of dining options when living on the outskirts of campus.
“As someone who used to live in Darnall, like way back when, thank God Epi’s now has meal swipes, because it was just kind of ridiculous that you only had two actual cafeterias on campus, and one of them you couldn’t access using meal swipes, you could only use Flex,” Danner-McDonald said in an interview with The Hoya. “It’s a ten minute walk to Leo’s from Darnall — maybe I’m just slow — but it always just felt ridiculous to me.”
Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) President Kole Wolfe (SFS ’24) said GUSA held meetings over the summer with university officials to discuss possible changes to the meal plan, like the changes made to Epi’s.
“The changes at Epi were influenced by a number of meetings that we had with auxiliary and dining over the summer,” Wolfe said. “We knew that an increase in dining options was a priority of many students, and we suggested that enabling the use of meal exchange and increasing hours to pre-pandemic levels was a step in the right direction, something that would be logistically achievable in the short term.”
In November 2021, the GUSA Senate passed a resolution calling for extended hours on weekends at Epi’s.
According to GUSA Senator Bora Balçay (SFS ’23), student feedback and vocal dissatisfaction with dining policies have been the driving motivators for these changes.
“The student body gave very clear guidance on the lack of dining options and the expansion of the plan is a direct result of that,” Balçay wrote to The Hoya.
According to Balçay, some students had expressed concerns with the accessibility of food for students who live far away from Leo’s, as well as the ability to use meal exchanges late at night. 
The implemented changes directly address these concerns, according to a university spokesperson.
“We make modifications to dining operations based on feedback, data and industry trends,” the university spokesperson wrote. “That feedback comes from students individually and in groups such as GUSA, as well as faculty, staff and other community members.”
According to Wolfe, food security during campus breaks was another primary concern behind GUSA’s advocacy to change meal plan policies, as many students who remained on campus over academic breaks struggled to find adequate access to food.
The new changes to the meal plan hope to remedy this problem.
“The lack of dining options on campus during breaks was a major issue last year,” Wolfe wrote. “Epi will remain open during breaks this year, a change which will hopefully ensure that students will be able to have access to a meal plan option if other plan locations are closed.”
GUSA Senator Alyssa Hirai (SFS ’24) said listening to student voices is most important as advocates try to secure future changes to the university meal plans, especially the voices of students who are most burdened by Georgetown’s meal plan requirements. 
“The meal plan requirement disproportionately affects FGLI (first-generation/ low income) students and so my personal goal has been to include GSP in this conversation and better advocate for them,” Hirai wrote.

Several changes were made to Georgetown’s New Student Orientation (NSO) for this year, including new modules on microaggressions and implicit bias training in an effort to foster a more inclusive and equitable welcoming for first-year and transfer students to the Hilltop.
NSO, which takes place in the days leading up to the first day of classes, is designed to ease the transition to campus for first-year and transfer students through a series of workshops and field trips. This year’s programming included modules on wellness and community expectations as  well as the new trainings focused on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).
This year’s NSO coordinators, Claire Atkerson (COL ’22), Ben Telerski (COL ’23), Marisa Morrison (SFS ’23) and Maya Shah (COL ’23), made the changes because they wanted to increase focus on equity and inclusion as a part of the first-year orientation experience, according to Atkerson.
“We instituted a microaggression and implicit bias training, which was aimed at making a more inclusive space for new students,” Atkerson wrote to The Hoya. “It focused on the impact of microaggressions, examples of common disability, race, gender, class, and sexuality-based microaggressions, and action items for people who encounter microaggressions as victims, perpetrators, and allies. 
The new modules also included a “Confronting Georgetown’s History” module to grapple with Georgetown’s history of enslavement, according to Atkerson. 
In 1838, Georgetown’s Jesuit presidents sold 314 enslaved people, who are known today as the GU272+, to pay off the university’s construction and maintenance debts. The sale of the GU272+ raised $115,000, which is equivalent to about $3.3 million today. The funds raised by the deal helped the university remain financially afloat. Following activism from the Georgetown community demanding reparations, President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) committed to creating a reconciliation fund in 2020.
First-year Claire Vogel (COL ’26) said she appreciated the attention given to GU272+ and conversations about racial issues at Georgetown during NSO.
“Coming to Georgetown from New Orleans, I was already familiar with the GU272,” Vogel wrote to The Hoya. “And being from a Deep South state where these conversations can be minimized, I really appreciated the school openly talking about its past and the active effort to educate and even mobilize students to help not only make reparations for the past, but also pave the way for a better future and a more inclusive environment.”
First-year student Julia Swerdin (COL ’26) said NSO helped to ease her transition to college by allowing her to better orient herself around campus and Washington, D.C. while getting to know fellow new students before classes started. 
Atkerson said she and other NSO coordinators chose to make changes to the programming based on her own experience at NSO as a first year. According to Atkerson, she felt out of place coming to Georgetown as a person of color and thought NSO did not do much to ameliorate that feeling.
“We had activities like the identity wheel, which were alright at introducing students to the concept of diversity but didn’t do a lot to prepare them to interact with people from different backgrounds,” Atkerson wrote.
Atkerson said these modules are important as students transition to a new environment in college.
“We covered topics on consent, safe drinking practices and mental health, and included upperclassmen orientation captains to give a bit of student perspective. We also had a ‘game’ where students were able to pour what they thought standard drink sizes were and compare them against actual standard drink sizes,” Atkerson wrote.
Swerdin said her favorite moment during NSO was the Jesuit panel, which allows first-year students to hear from members of different faiths from Campus Ministry. Swerdin, who is Jewish, said this event helped to make her feel welcome on campus.
“Coming to a Jesuit school, I wasn’t really sure where I’d fit in religiously, or spiritually, or culturally, so to immediately have the reassurance that there is a group of ministry that are here to have my back and to be welcoming and opening to every single student including me was really nice,” Swerdin said to The Hoya.
Atkerson said she has heard positive feedback from NSO Orientation Advisors (OAs) and new students on the changes made to the program and hopes that future coordinators will build on the work they have done to make NSO more inclusive.
“I have heard positive feedback from OAs and new students, who said that particularly the DEI-related changes made them feel more included in the Georgetown community,” Atkerson wrote. “That in particular really warms my heart, because that’s exactly what I wanted from NSO when I was a first year.”

The Georgetown University School of Foreign Service (SFS) welcomed its first cohort of four undergraduate students from Ukraine who are currently studying at Georgetown through a scholarship from the Gracias Family Foundation.
Georgetown graduates Antonio Gracias (SFS ’92, GRD ’93) and Sabrina Kuhl Gracias (GSB ’93) donated $5 million to the university, announced June 8,  to establish the Gracias Family Sunflower Current Use Scholarship Fund. The fund will provide support for students who reside in or have been displaced by the ongoing war in Ukraine. Undergraduate students in all Georgetown schools who demonstrate financial need will be eligible to receive scholarships, as well as graduate students in the SFS who can receive merit-based scholarships.
In addition to covering tuition and fees, the fund also provides students with emergency funds to pay for course materials, travel expenses, health insurance, room and board, living expenses and visa expenses.
The fund will allow the SFS to continue its founding mission of understanding and preventing future international conflict, according to the university press release. 
The first cohort of undergraduate students, Olha Kovach (SFS ’26), Kyryl Myronenko (SFS ’26), Oleksandr Sinhayivskyy (SFS ’26) and Tetiana Tkachenko (SFS ’26) arrived at Georgetown for the Fall 2022 semester.
Myronenko said he has enjoyed his first few weeks at Georgetown and has already been able to follow his academic interests. 
“My experience in Georgetown so far is that I knew it would be good, but I didn’t know it would be that good,” Myronenko said to The Hoya. “I like all my classes so far, and people are so nice. And it’s a really good place to be in, especially for someone as interested in politics and as impacted by politics as well as more specifically the politics about the war.”
Kovach is in a proseminar, a required class for all SFS first-year students, on “Forced Displacement” with Rochelle Davis, an associate professor in the Center for Contemporary Studies in the SFS. Kovach said she has found that the SFS serves a unique purpose in bringing students together from a multitude of backgrounds to have productive discussions on issues such as war displacement, and allows her to explore the topic further. 
“It’s really interesting to talk to others and hear about their backgrounds, and especially during the classes when we have an opportunity to discuss things,” Kovach said in an interview with The Hoya. “Even though we can talk about specific topics, everyone can impact the conversation with their backgrounds. It’s really interesting to me.”
Sinhayivskyy has enjoyed meeting other first-year students and learning from those in the Georgetown community. 
“The really nice part is that everyone is so smart here,” Sinhayivskyy said in an interview with The Hoya. “I’m sure there are people that are scared of that. I was at first. This occurred to me, though, when I had my first late night discussion in the dorm room. We just gathered some people from the hall and we talked about everything, from Harry Potter books to politics. It’s just really nice to get an insight from the people who know so much. And this is just the first two weeks.”
SFS Dean Joel Hellman is honored to bring these students to the university and is proud of the way they are being supported by the Georgetown community.
“To see how the entire Georgetown community has mobilized to support students confronting the horrible war in Ukraine is to see the true spirit of Georgetown,” Hellman wrote to The Hoya. “These students bring to our campus a first hand understanding of the devastating realities of conflict and a deep appreciation for the essential value of freedom in global affairs.  We could not be more pleased and proud to welcome them to our community.”
According to Myronenko, the Georgetown community is special because it brings students from all over the world together in the pursuit of friendship and understanding. 
“I’ve been trying to make this quote in my mind about Georgetown, how it serves as a place where people from all over the place, from all over the world, can feel at home,” Myronenko said. “Everyone here can be themselves. Everyone can just bring their own personalities. And it’s so good that it’s mainly not about the U.S. or any particular country. It’s mainly about the world, the world we’re living in.”
Myronenko said he is grateful to be in a place where learning is nurtured, and students are free to express their opinions and share their understanding of the world.
“This is an amazing place for us because you can seek knowledge basically everywhere, because everyone has different perspectives and different understandings, knowledge and wisdom,” Myronenko said. “I’m so happy to be here and so grateful.”

As an SFS alum who studied in the Soviet Union, I was heartened to see so many students from there come over here after the Berlin Wall came down.  From my conversations with Soviet students, I could tell they envied our ability to travel and study in other countries.  I am glad to see Georgetown making an effort to host students from Ukraine.

Former Georgetown beer hall and sports bar Church Hall, which closed in February due to violations from the Washington, D.C. Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration (ABRA), reopened as a hybrid cafe and bar, Clubhouse.
The restaurant, which opened Aug. 9, will serve a variety of patrons throughout the day. During the day, the Wisconsin Avenue restaurant will be a work-friendly coffee shop with Internet action for patrons of all ages. After 5 p.m., the space will become a restaurant and bar accessible only to those ages 23 and up. The new age requirement follows previous difficulties for Church Hall with fake IDs and serving alcohol to minors.
Clubhouse General Manager Elliot Howe said he hopes that the new business model is a great opportunity for the restaurant to reach out to an even wider audience.
“We wanted to create a space that felt more in-line with the awesome community we’re in,” Howe said in an interview with The Hoya. “Whether you’re a student looking for a place to study and drink coffee, grabbing drinks with coworkers at the end of the day or just want a spot to get pizza with your kids — we’ve got you covered.”
Bar and restaurant development group Tin Shop Group, which operates the space formerly operated as Church Hall, made the decision to shut down the bar following several violations from the ABRA. 
According to ABRA Chief of Staff Jared Powell, Church Hall had an extensive investigative history since its opening in 2018. Records show the restaurant had several incidences of failure to file quarterly financial statements and failure to comply with food requirements.
The restaurant received repeated fines and punishments as a result of these violations. Church Hall was given a warning for selling alcohol to minors in 2018. In 2019 and December 2021, the restaurant received $3,000 fines and five-day suspensions for selling alcohol to minors.
In February, Church Hall faced the same charge and was given another $3,000 fine and five-day suspension, in addition to a mandatory alcohol training program for all employees serving alcohol. Following the penalties, Church Hall management made the decision to shut down the restaurant and explore alternative business models.
Church Hall was known by Georgetown University, George Washington University and American University students as a popular underage gathering spot given its close location to Georgetown and an increased reputation of allowing students to enter with fake IDs.
According to Tin Shop Co-Founder Geoff Dawson, the choice to set the minimum age of the bar at 23 will allow them to maintain a more sustainable business model and decrease the use of fake identifications.
Dawson told DCist that the quality of fake IDs created problems with the ABRA for Church Hall. Once it became a college bar, Dawson found it hard to shake that reputation without a complete revamp.
Clubhouse also expanded its menu in the hopes of attracting a more diverse crowd. Howe said he hopes the menu will provide an upscale environment for sports fans to gather and socialize.
“We want to give the people of Georgetown a different experience when watching sporting events. Gone are the times of greasy food and lite beers,” Howe said in a recent press release by the restaurant. “Our team has worked together to come up with food and drinks that are enjoyable for everyone in the party no matter the time.”
Customers have embraced Clubhouse as another coffee shop for work in the Georgetown neighborhood, according to Jessica Visone, who works at Clubhouse.
“The people who come stop by end up staying pretty much the whole day working there,” Visone wrote to The Hoya. “Customers have loved the vibe and the coffee, which is so nice to see. I don’t stay past coffee shop close, so I can’t speak for the nightlife but I think customers really do like the mix between the bar and coffee shop feel while doing work during the day.”
Visone said the hope is Georgetown students are able to visit Clubhouse and take advantage of the space as a study spot.
“One of the big things was making it more cafe/work-friendly,” Visone wrote. “There’s super cute couches and tables for students to set up at. There’s also a lot more food options for breakfast and lunch while there.”
Clubhouse says that since its opening, the restaurant has received a positive response from customers. 
“We are getting great feedback on the food, drink and coffee menu!” Howe said. “The team put in a lot of effort to make sure their experience from morning to night would be top notch.”

Georgetown University partnered with 56 Catholic colleges and universities to file an amicus curiae brief advocating for the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold affirmative action in admissions in two upcoming cases.
In the brief, which was published Aug. 1, Georgetown partnered with the University of Notre Dame, the College of the Holy Cross and Villanova University among other Catholic institutions asserting the right to consider racial diversity in holistic admissions processes to build diverse student bodies and learning environments. The university led the authorship of the amicus brief after the Court announced it will hear two cases this fall challenging the role of race in college admissions: Students For Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard University and Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. University of North Carolina.
In both cases, the challengers are calling on the Supreme Court to overrule the Grutter v. Bollinger decision, which upheld that the University of Michigan’s race-conscious admissions program for its law school did not unduly harm nonminority applicants. Given the court’s 6-3 conservative majority, the cases could position the court to make major changes to the legal status of affirmative action. Both cases will be heard Oct. 31.
Georgetown has historically supported affirmative action in university admissions; it filed an amicus brief for Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003 and again in 2016 to support admission policies for Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin.
Catholic higher education institutions seek diversity in their student bodies to advance their educational and religious missions, according to the brief.
“Diversity creates a learning environment that furthers the pedagogical goals of Catholic colleges and universities, including rigorous thinking, understanding of and empathy toward people of different backgrounds, concern for the poor and underserved, and leadership in service to others,” the brief reads.
The brief also asserts that the right to consider racial diversity is rooted in the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause and Free Exercise Clause.
“As to all colleges and universities, racial diversity in admissions serves a compelling interest in academic freedom that is grounded in the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause,” the brief reads. “And as to Catholic colleges and universities in particular, racial diversity in admissions additionally serves a compelling interest in freedom of religious practice and expression that is grounded in the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause.”
Rosemary Kilkenny (LAW ’87), vice president for diversity, equity, and inclusion and chief diversity officer at Georgetown, said a commitment to fostering a diverse student body is central to Georgetown’s identity as a Catholic university.
“Through our value of community in diversity, Georgetown is committed to creating equitable, inclusive and diverse communities that enhance our learning environments,” Kilkenny told The Hoya. “This is foundational to our commitment to academic excellence and to our identity as a Catholic, Jesuit university.”
Georgetown Associate Vice President of Equal Opportunity, Affirmative Action, and Compliance Bisi Okubadejo said she is proud Georgetown continues to stand with higher education institutions in supporting affirmative action policies.
“I am proud that Georgetown has taken action on this issue, standing together with more than 50 colleges and universities for affirmative action and the sustained ability to create equitable, inclusive and diverse learning environments for our students,” Okubadejo said in an interview with The Hoya. “This is critical to our Catholic, Jesuit mission, as well as our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion.”
When asked for comment, a university spokesperson directed The Hoya to a statement about the brief on the university’s website. 
In the statement, University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) said creating diverse spaces in educational communities is central to Georgetown’s Jesuit tradition and remains a pillar of promoting justice and equality in education.
“Georgetown, the oldest Catholic and Jesuit university in the nation, was founded on the principle that engagement between people of different faiths, cultures and beliefs promotes intellectual development, an understanding of service and solidarity, and a commitment to the common good,” DeGioia said in the statement.
Kilkenny said creating classrooms that are inclusive and diverse through affirmative action policies prepares students to be better citizens after graduation.
“It also is pivotal to the training of students as future leaders, and engaged citizens,” Kilkenny said. “It’s important for us as Catholic higher education institutions to reinforce together how crucial racially diverse admissions and resulting classrooms are to our continuing missions.”

New research from a McDonough School of Business (MSB) professor revealed the impact climate change and extreme weather may have on the economy.
Jason Schloetzer, an associate professor of business administration at the MSB, compiled data from years of Gallup polls measuring general economic outlook. His findings suggest extreme highs and lows in temperature negatively impact individuals’ beliefs about economic conditions, thus reducing stock returns.
Schloetzer said his findings could provide insight into how climate change shapes perceptions of the economy, as extremely high and low temperatures become increasingly common.
“This paper basically says that when it’s unusually hot or cold outside, people are more pessimistic about the current and future state of the U.S. economy, and this negative sentiment drives abnormal declines in the stock returns of local companies,” Schloetzer wrote to The Hoya. “The most interesting implication is that climate factors might change how people form beliefs about the future, suggesting that climate change may actually change the process through which people perceive future events.”
Christos Makridis, a research assistant professor at Arizona State University’s W.P. Carey School of Business and co-author of the paper, said that while researchers are unable to pinpoint concrete reasons why extreme temperatures impact economic outlook, the paper provides a foundation to explore the reasons behind this phenomenon.
“One theory has to do with how people are feeling. If really hot or cold temperatures make people more pessimistic about the economy, perhaps it is because that causes them to be indoors more and get less social interaction with others,” Makridis wrote. “Unfortunately, hard to pin down exactly without more comprehensive data!”
Makridis keeps expectations within reason when considering whether climate change’s detrimental impact on stock returns might force corporations to become more environmentally conscious. 
“The tendency these days is to announce an ambitious target without thinking through all the ramifications, so our hope is just that every organization thinks about the supply chain of what they’re producing and the implications of each action,” Makridis wrote. “Everyone should look to leave things better off than when they found them, including other people and the environment.”
Schloetzer said conclusions drawn from the paper have already shaped the curriculum for the classes he teaches.
“The research process almost always motivates me to bring new ideas into the classroom,” Schloetzer wrote. “And the results of this paper inspired me to help students understand better how to incorporate various sustainability-related factors (emissions, water usage, biodiversity impacts, recycling of plastics) into thinking about the value of a firm’s contributions to society.”
Faculty research contributes to the creation of new programs like the new Master’s of Science in Environmental and Sustainability Management, according to Program Co-Director Maria Petrova.
“Faculty research informs the topics students cover in class and also gets students involved in established fieldwork and ongoing research partnerships,” Petrova wrote to The Hoya. “Research also plays an important role for designing new degree programs, especially related to the spheres of environment and sustainability.”
The incorporation of new research, such as the work of Schloetzer and Makridis, into curricula provides students with the latest information available in their fields, according to Petrova. 
“For example, the MS-ESM program was launched with two focus areas — Climate Change and Energy,” Petrova wrote. “As we think about adding new focus areas to this program and designing other programmatic offerings, faculty and staff research interests and expertise will be key in determining the direction of such new academic developments.”
Makridis said it is important to consider how the economy can be impacted by factors such as the environment when aiming to understand a complete picture of the economic state.
“To me, economics is just a big toolkit that can be deployed in so many different situations, so it lends itself well to everything from the environment to labor markets,” Makridis wrote to The Hoya. “The biggest lesson is how people’s attitudes and beliefs about market fundamentals can be shaped by their own lived experience, including even smaller events like the weather on a day.”
