Members of the GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee met for a second Student Activities Fee and Endowment reform town hall, this time discussing the possibility of raising the fee by anywhere from $5 to $100.
“After the last town hall [on Oct. 27], a few students reached out to us and asked about raising the fee because Georgetown’s fee is currently in the bottom 25 percent of peer institutions,” Fin/App Chair Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) said.
In response to these suggestions, Georgetown University Student Association proposed to increase the fee by an amount ranging from $5 to $100 in their presentation in order to meet the needs of the overall student body and advisory boards.
“The school will likely not be increasing its funding of student groups, so the burden is on GUSA,” Fin/App member Colton Malkerson (COL ’13) said.
In their presentation of the potential fee hike, Fin/App members said that with a minimum increase of $70 and full allocation of the $170 to funding student activities, there would be over $1 million to allocate to student clubs.
Senators also retained the proposal to allocate 100 percent of the Student Activities Fee to student groups, as well as a possible rise in the fee to match inflation.
Compared to the Oct. 27 forum, this town hall drew a larger crowd of about 30 students to discuss the potential changes to the Student Activities Fee.
In order to better assess the needs of the student groups, Laverriere said that the Fin/App Committee had spoken with the advisory boards and encouraged them to prepare to make budget shifts. The Fin/App Committee also stressed the need for each student group to figure out how much additional funding they would like to request and justify their increased need.
“This will help us get a better idea of what the fee should be raised to if needed. There are also a lot of capital projects concerning student space and student safety around campus that could be funded over the next couple of years,” Laverriere said.
Senators also stressed the need to get student feedback on SAFE reform.
“To ensure that this referendum is legitimate we will continue our efforts to educate the student body – however, decisions are made by those who show up. I’m sure some will oppose and criticize our efforts, but if those people don’t voice their opinion, attend our town halls and participate, then their opinion won’t really matter,” Malkerson said.
Students can get involved with SAFE reform through talking to their senators or emailing the Fin/App Committee at GUSAFinanceandAppropriationsgmail.com. GUSA representatives also stressed that students are welcome to attend GUSA Senate meetings on Sundays at 4:30 p.m. in Healy Hall, as well as Fin/App Committee meetings Wednesdays at 8 p.m. in the GUSA office.
Wednesday’s meeting was not the last word on the final SAFE reform referendum. There will be another town hall on Nov. 9, when Fin/App will most likely present a tentative plan to bring to a vote.

#AbdurChowdhury Georgetown on Wednesday.
Chowdhury, Twitter’s chief scientist and a veteran faculty member of Georgetown’s computer science department, spoke to a standing-room only audience in McShain Lounge, discussing the importance of using technology to connect the world.
As Twitter’s chief scientist, Chowdhury handles a tremendous amount of data from individuals across the world – 175 million people have Twitter accounts. Account holders range from everyday citizens to the president of Russia, who visited the Twitter office in person to set up an account. Among those accounts, 90 million tweets occur on average each day at a rate of one tweet per millisecond. These statistics, Chowdhury suggests, should not be taken at numerical face value. Rather, these numbers show what the world is talking about.
Chowdhury went on to describe the idea of “trend engines,” the key to understanding what is important and interesting to people. The first step to reaching this understanding, Chowdhury suggests, is to find trend entities – what people are talking about and who is doing the talking. Twitter analysts then notice trends in the conversations, and decide which trends are the most relevant to others across the globe.
“Trends change our awareness of the globe,” Chowdhury said. “Trends aren’t supposed to be news – they’re supposed to elicit what people are interested in.”
Trend engines in Twitter are used to keep tabs on these interests, by gauging what is important to people in a certain locale; the Twitter team then uses the information to consider focused interests as part of a larger, global picture.
“It’s like walking around the planet and getting quick insights into global minds,” Chowdhury said.
Chowdhury warned the audience that with trend engines comes some misuse. On a daily basis; Twitter addresses problems with ranking and gaming, both schemes to make popular, rather than interesting, topics the top trends of the day. Chowdhury used obsessive Justin Bieber fans as an example of such efforts.
He did suggest, however, that gaming can be beneficial when used to promote topics that have a wide reach. Twitter followers have organized trends such as “charity Tuesday,” a place for account holders to tweet about their favorite charities.
“It’s interesting to see how Twitter lets people work together, from all over the world, for things that matter the most to them,” Chowdhury said. “When people can get other people talking about a certain topic, it sends a powerful message.”
Computer science students found the lecture thought-provoking.
“It was nice to see a practical application for all we learn in our computer science courses,” Duncan Gillespie (COL ’13) said.
Tyler Sax (COL ’13) said knowing Chowdhury spent days in the computer science department 10 years ago was reassuring.
“It is always impressive to see a Hoya move on and do something as impressive as Twitter,” he said.
For Chowdhury, the promise technology holds for society is most important.
“I find most people seem to get more value from life by sharing it with others,” Chowdhury said. “Technology isn’t just bringing us together – it’s helping us understand each other, and ourselves, better.”

The Medical Center, already the top recipient of grants at Georgetown, received another one last week when the Center for Child and Human Development received a $17 million federal gift, one of the highest in the Medical Center’s history, to provide mental health care and services for children and adolescents.
The five-year grant, awarded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, a branch of the Department of Justice, was announced on Oct. 29. The money will go to the National Technical Assistance for Children’s Mental Health, or TA Center.
The program works with families and other programs dedicated to mental health to help children who may have or are at risk for mental illnesses. It also works with children who suffer from developmental disabilities and substance abuse.
Phyllis Magrab, a pediatrics professor and director of the GUCCHD and principal investigator of the TA Center, said that she was pleased by the grant and hopes to use the money to extend the center’s capabilities.
“This grant is a cornerstone of the [GUCCHD]. It has changed the face of how children and youth with mental health needs are served in this country. . With the advent of health care reform, our work will be even more important,” Magrab said.
The TA Center, which was originally created by a federal grant in 1984, hopes to use the money to extend its capabilities.
This is not the only federal grant the Medical Center has received this year. In January, the center received $17 million for faculty research. The National Institutes of Health also gave $38 million jointly to Howard University and Georgetown, for the next five years, in July of 2010.
The federal government also recently awarded a number of other grants to the university on the whole. The National Institute of Standards and Technology gave $6.9 million for construction of the new Science Center. The university was also granted $10 million from the NIH to set up a community stroke education program in the Medical Center in 2007.
In a press release on Oct. 29, Howard J. Federoff, executive vice president for health sciences, praised Magrab’s commitment as a key factor in the Medical Center receiving the grant.
“Magrab is recognized as an international champion for children with disabilities. Through the initiatives of the [TA] Center, thousands of children and families have benefited. Magrab’s tireless dedication has led to a state-of-the-art approach to childhood mental health adopted by communities across the nation.”

The Office of the Provost has announced that it aims to approve the new five-year plan for faculty pay schedules and annual merit-based pay increases proposed by the Main Campus Planning Committee before Thanksgiving.
A memo sent by Provost James O’Donnell to all university employees on Oct. 28 said a new five-year plan was on the horizon, but did not elaborate on many of the specific details of the plan.
“Recognizing that we must both continue to take prudent fiscal measures and make strategic investments in our core mission, we are taking several steps related to compensation,” the memo stated.
The new plan, which would go into effect at the beginning of the university’s fiscal year in July 2011, would help to keep Georgetown’s compensation levels competitive with schools of similar prestige that may have deeper pockets.
When asked whether the university has had recent difficulty recruiting and retaining talented faculty members due to the lure of better pay at other universities, Terrence Reynolds, chair of the main campus executive faculty, was noncommittal.
“Georgetown seems to lose some people, but not many,” he said.
O’Donnell agreed, citing what many feel has been the success of the soon-to-expire 10-year faculty pay plan that was implemented in 2000. “Not in the recent past,” he said. “We have slowed that over the past years.”
The plan implemented in 2000 was aimed at combating peer universities’ efforts to convince top faculty to leave the Hilltop.
“The fact that [those] salaries are lower than at other schools with which we compete for faculty was major motivation for the plan adopted in 2000, and remains a concern. Even more is being done to close the gap in the plan for the next five years,” Wayne Davis, chair of the philosophy department and president of the Faculty Senate , said. “Since Georgetown does not have the financial strength of the universities we compete with, we cannot just eliminate the gap overnight.”
At the heart of the new plan is the creation of a 3 percent merit pool from which annual pay increases for main campus faculty will be allocated. The raise each faculty member receives will be based on a performance evaluation.
“Some faculty members could receive nothing and some could potentially receive 15 percent,” O’Donnell said.
The metrics for evaluating performance have been carefully developed, according to Reynolds, who oversees the department chairs and faculty leadership responsible for formulating academic policy on the main campus.
Two of the key evaluators in awarding merit pay, which vary slightly across the various departments, are how frequently and successfully a faculty member publishes and his or her effectiveness as an educator.
“To alleviate the effects of having no increase during [the 2010-2011 academic year], the university has frozen benefits rates for staff. . The main campus has begun a study of staff and non-tenure-line faculty compensation with a view to developing long-term plans by March of 2011. Staff salary planning is very different than that for tenure-line faculty,” Davis said in the memo.
The memo also detailed the addition of a few extra days off for faculty during winter break and a postponement of premium increases in health care, parking expenses and child care until July.
Another key feature of the new plan involves more attempts to compete with outside recruitment of the university’s high-profile professors. A reserve pool of cash will be available for use at the discretion of O’Donnell to provide some additional financial cushion for faculty members being courted by other universities.
The main campus executive faculty approved the plan with 24 votes in favor and one abstention.
“I think [the plan] was well-conceived and well structured,” Reynolds said. “I think it was fair.”

November 5, 2010 by Neil Quinn Leave a Comment 
Last year, during finals week, a Georgetown student found himself simply overloaded with work and wearing out the energy from his usual caffeine fix.
So he made a choice familiar to a number of students at Georgetown. He went to meet a dealer a friend had referred him to, paid $30 and headed to Lauinger Library with two small pills in his pocket.
“I took one in the morning . and holed up in a cubicle all day until about midnight, only taking quick breaks for food,” the student, who wished to remain anonymous due to the illegal nature of this drug use, said. “It sounds kind of awful, but . I was able to write five pages of my research paper in about an hour.”
He said that the drug did not negatively affect the quality of his paper. Rather, he felt that his mental functioning was better off.
“Altogether that day I wrote 18 pages of my research paper, turned it in the next morning and ultimately got an A,” he said.
The two pills were Adderall, a prescription stimulant drug usually used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. Under U.S. law, Adderall is classified a Schedule II drug; by taking it without a prescription, this student was risking prison time.
But that is a risk that some Georgetown students said they are willing to take. According to a student survey conducted last spring by Counseling and Psychiatric Services, less than 10 percent of Georgetown students had taken stimulants like Adderall without a prescription during the past year. CAPS declined to release a more specific figure.
Philip Meilman, the director of CAPS, said that this figure was lower than many students might think.
“Research has shown that college students nationwide, Georgetown included, consistently overestimate the use of alcohol and other drugs by their peers,” he said in an email to THE HOYA. “[This number stands] in contrast to the perception that such use is commonplace.”
A rate near 10 percent places Georgetown students above the national average rate of use of similar drugs by college students. In 2007, according to the Department of Health and Human Service’s National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 6.4 percent of full-time college students nationwide reported using drugs like Adderall the past year.
Unlike with most other drugs on campus, many students consume Adderall legally – namely students diagnosed with ADHD who are prescribed stimulant medications. Some students willingly distribute it to friends, whether as gifts or for a price; most feel occasional pressure to do so.
Patrick Kilcarr, director of the university’s Center for Personal Development within Health Education Services, has seen occasional problems with Adderall use during the years he has spent counseling and educating students about drug use.
“I don’t think it’s at epidemic level. I don’t think it’s something that all students are doing, . but it’s definitely there, and it’s evident,” he said.
Kilcarr has also seen students drawn toward dependence, just a step shy of addiction.
“It’s not like throwing a Pez in your mouth, and you just kind of carry on,” he said. “These are very powerful medications that have powerful effects on the nervous system.”
Adderall is a low-dose mixture of amphetamines – the same type of compound as the street drug methamphetamine, Kellar said.
“Don’t let the drug companies snow you. They’re selling you amphetamines – which is fine. It works for hyperactivity and a few other things. It’s a perfectly reasonable drug when it’s used appropriately,” he said.
Kilcarr sees the abuse of stimulants as an extreme example of a larger social problem.
“You go to the 7-Eleven and to the left and right of the cashier are all these 5-hour Energy drinks and all this other kind of stuff. It’s just pulsating through our culture – everybody’s busy, lots going on, and [you hope] it can just help you to manage all the crap on your plate.”
One sophomore diagnosed with ADHD, who requested anonymity due to concerns about more illegal solicitations from his peers, described the lengths students go to when seeking out the drug.
“Usually after I first tell people, or they find out . that I have ADHD, usually they’ll make a joke, `Hey, you want to sell me some?’ and usually they won’t mean it at the time,” he said.
“But the next time, when they have a test or an essay to write . they’ll ask [seriously]. . The reason why you usually don’t tell people in the first place is that you want to avoid this. You feel bad saying no, because these are your friends.”
Maddie McLennon (COL ’13), who has been prescribed Ritalin since the second semester of last year, said she is aware that some people would readily take her pills.
“When I leave my desk [in Lauinger Library], I’m more worried that people would steal my medication, if I had some in my backpack, than my laptop,” she said.
Not all students try to guard their prescriptions. One sophomore, who asked to remain anonymous because of her illegal use of Adderall, said that she’s always been able to find sources. She said that she takes the drug about 10 times a semester to help her with her schoolwork.
She first took the drug last year during final exams, after a friend offered her one. After that, the work got much easier.
“I concentrated, I worked. I studied for hours on end – eight, nine hours,” she said. “I thought I’d been getting Cs on everything else, and I aced my finals.”
“You can always find someone who’s willing to sell Adderall,” she said. “When I get it from my close friends, I don’t pay, but if they don’t have enough . I’ll try to buy. I used to pay $10 for one pill.”
She said she thought the drug did not give her an unfair advantage and did not endanger her health.
“I feel like Adderall’s open to everyone, so it’s not really cheating. . I really think everything in moderation’s okay.”
The abuse of Adderall is nothing new, according to Kenneth Kellar, professor of pharmacology at the Medical Center.
“The drug’s been around longer, but it’s been abused since the 1940s,” he said. “Hitler used it. The German Army used it. . Your parents’ generation – my generation – used it to study. You guys didn’t invent this.”
Ritalin, an ADHD drug that is also sold under the brand name Concerta, is not an amphetamine like Adderall, but it has similar effects.
“You take a drug like amphetamine and you can study better and focus more, and you feel good, you feel like you can beat the world,” Kellar said.
But Adderall does not come without drawbacks.
“The last time – it was like a week ago – I took some and I pulled an all-nighter, and around 7 a.m., I was trying to go to bed and I couldn’t,” the sophomore said. “My heart was palpitating, and I got so scared,” she said. “You always calm down, but then you’re so tired the next day. You’re so drowsy; you have a terrible down.”

The Corp celebrated its Shareholders’ Extravaganza yesterday with free T-shirts, a 10 percent discount coupon and a roundtable discussion with student groups.
According to CEO Brad Glasser (COL ’11), part of The Corp’s mission is to represent the student body in ways in which the university administration does not, which in the past has meant speaking up for student rights and providing aid to student-run organizations.
The Corp first made all students shareholders after a 1971 May Day protest resulted in police usage of tear gas on campus. According to Glasser, then-University President Robert Henle, S.J., approved the tear gas measure, which disrupted classes and affected thousands of students, many of whom were not involved in the protest. In response to the event, which most thought violated basic student rights, Corp leaders incorporated the entire student body and took it upon the company to provide a forum for student discussion.
Yesterday’s Extravaganza did much more than has been done in the past to explain the opportunities that students have as shareholders. A table in the Leavey Center offered free shirts and 10 percent discount coupons throughout the day, as well as a brief information card that explained the history behind the corporation. The Corp also hosted a roundtable discussion with about a dozen student organizations that addressed the ways in which groups can unite and communicate more effectively.
At the discussion, group leaders considered the hurdles organizations face, focusing primarily on the disunity of the student body and the inability to efficiently recruit and communicate with students. Many leaders expressed frustration with the university’s management of student groups and sought ways to better their relations.
“It’s the bureaucracy of Georgetown that makes clubs coming together so difficult,” said Justin Keenan Miller (COL ’11), who holds leadership positions in both Nomadic Theater and Strike Force.
Led by Corp leaders, organization leaders resolved to work toward a more unified student body.
“It’s the job of student leaders to reach out and to get people involved,” Diamond Graham (SFS ’11), who represented D.C. Reads and the Center for Social Justice, said.
Part of this resolution was to propose a second-semester student group fair at which students could be re-exposed to groups on campus. Leaders also discussed a unified communication system between groups that would enable organizations to unite on projects more easily.
“There is the ability to bring clubs together, but right now the methods for that are very difficult,” Keenan Miller said.
Though the meeting did not come to any direct decisions, Corp leaders were pleased with the dialogue and say they hope to see the discussions continue. They also hope to involve more student groups going forward.
“This was the beginning of many meetings,” Corp Service and Outreach Chair Margaux McGrath (COL ’12) said.”

Georgetown alumni won multiple midterm elections throughout the nation Tuesday, though not without controversy.
Incumbent Illinois Gov. Patrick Quinn (D) (SFS ’71), a former sports editor of THE HOYA, was declared the winner in the gubernatorial race by the Associated Press Thursday evening, defeating Bill Brady, an Illinois state senator. Quinn has served as governor since January 2009, when he took over in his capacity as lieutenant governor following Gov. Rod Blagojevich’s arrest in a corruption scandal.
Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska)(CAS ’80), incumbent Republican senator, is still awaiting the results of the write-in candidacy she launched after being upset by primary challenger and candidate Joe Miller, endorsed by Sarah Palin. As of press time, votes were still being counted and all write-in candidates had received a combined 41 percent of the vote, Miller had received 34 percent of the vote and Democrat McAdams had received 24 percent. In Alaska, write-in votes are counted collectively in the first round and are only assigned to specific candidates if the total number of write-in votes lead after the first count or are within a half percentage point of the leader. Analysts say counting all the write-in votes could take weeks. Alaskan election law is based on intent, so votes with minor misspellings of Murkowski’s name should still be counted in her favor.
In South Dakota, Stephanie Herseth-Sandlin (LAW ’97) lost a tight race for the state’s at-large seat to Republican Kristi Noem by less than three points.
ost other races have been resolved, and several fresh faces from the Hilltop’s ranks will be joining more veteran Hoya legislators in the upcoming Congress. Georgetown has a long legacy of former Hoyas serving in the Capitol, with 151 faculty and alumni having represented their constituents and the Hilltop in Washington since William Gaston became a congressman from North Carolina in 1813.
This year, Mick Mulvaney (SFS ’89), a Republican, wrested the largely rural 5th district of Virginia from long-time representative John Spratt with a 55 percent to 45 percent win.
Hansen Clarke (LAW ’87), a Democrat, will take over Michigan’s 13th congressional district, consisting of urban Detroit and surrounding suburbs. Clarke will be the first Bangladeshi-American to serve in Congress. He won the primary in August over incumbent Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, the mother of former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick.
David Cicilline (LAW ’86), a Rhode Island Democrat, won the Bay State’s at-large district from Patrick Kennedy, who opted not to run for re-election. Cicilline is notable for being the first openly gay Georgetown alum who is a member of Congress.
U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) (LAW ’92) defeated Democrat Alex Giannoulias in the race for an open Senate seat, most recently occupied by Roland Burris, who was appointed to the spot after President Obama was elected.
On the larger scale, a clear showing of voter dissatisfaction with incumbent Democratic leaders swept the Republicans into control of the House and gave them major gains in the Senate, but there were few surprises in D.C. metro area elections, with the region trending Democrat.
Vincent Gray, the chairman of the D.C. Council, won a landslide victory in the mayoral race after earning the Democratic nod by defeating incumbent mayor Adrian Fenty back in September’s primary.
Del. Eleanor Holmes-Norton (D-D.C.), a Law Center faculty member, was handily re-elected to an 11th term as D.C.’s non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives.
The only undecided race in the beltway is Virginia’s 11th congressional district, made up of Fairfax and Prince William counties. With fewer than 300 provisional ballots left to sort through, first-term incumbent Democratic representative Gerry Connolly is less than half of a percentage point ahead in the polls over his Republican challenger, Keith Fimian.
Per Virginia election law, Fimian’s campaign may request a recount paid for by the state once the final voting results are certified. It is currently unclear what Fimian will decide to do.
The results in Virginia’s two other neighboring districts, the 8th – containing Arlington – and the 10th – containing Vienna – were no surprises. Both incumbents won by solid majorities in their districts: Jim Moran (D-08) garnered 61 percent to his Republican opponent’s 37 percent, while Frank Wolf (R-10) walked away with an easy victory with 63 percent of the vote as compared to Democratic challenger Jeff Barnett’s 35 percent.
In Maryland, the 8th district, which includes Bethesda and Silver Springs, was easily held by incumbent Democrat and Chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chris Van Hollen (LAW ’90), who took 73 percent of the vote to Republican challenger Michael Philips’ 25 percent. “
