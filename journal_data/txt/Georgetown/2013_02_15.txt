The ticket of Jack Appelbaum   (COL ’14) and Maggie Cleary (COL ’14) is running neck and neck with Nate Tisa(SFS ’14) and Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) in the GUSAexecutive campaign, according to a poll conducted by The Hoya on Tuesday and released today.
The two leading tickets each scored 21 percent among likely voters. Shavonnia Corbin Johnson (SFS ’14) and JoeVandegriff (COL ’14) placed a close third with 17 percent.
The door-to-door poll, which had nearly 800 respondents, showed Spencer Walsh (MSB ’14) and Robert Silverstein (SFS ’14) at 6 percent and Cannon Warren (SFS ’14) and Andrew Logerfo (COL ’14) at 2 percent with just over one week until the Feb. 21 election. However, a plurality of students polled, 30 percent, indicated that they were still undecided, with 11 percent saying they did not plan on voting.
The poll also asked students if they approved of the performance of current GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13). An overwhelming 45 percent of students supported the executive leaders versus just 4 percent disapproving and 51 percent saying they had no opinion.
 
Correction: The total number of juniors polled was 153, 128 of whom identified as likely voters. The percentages displayed in the pie chart reflect the proper statistics.

Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey, who assumed his position Jan. 7, aims in his new position to revamp his department and improve its reputation on campus.
“One of my goals is to effectively lead the staff … to a culture of continuous improvement,” Moreywrote in an email. “We must provide outstanding client service while doing the best job possible caring for the campus assets, in a sustainable way, with available resources. This requires collaboration with university and community stakeholders, effective prioritization and a laser-like focus on our core mission areas.”
Morey said his time working as superintendent of the Senate Office Buildings reinforced his belief that organizational management must delineate clear goals for its personnel to be effective.
“Organizational units must have a clear and singular mission focus,” Morey wrote. “While the Office of Planning and Facilities Management has numerous responsibilities, it is imperative we set clear expectations and priorities for each mission area and effectively communicate those expectations to our staff.”
Students often complain about facilities staff’s slow response time to work orders. Especially in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy last fall, students said facilities did not work quickly enough to address their problems.
“I’ve gotten emails before that tell me that my work order has been completed when nothing has actually gotten accomplished,” Katie Mangialardi (COL ’16) said. “Facilities definitely has some gaps in communication between its different divisions and that creates a lot of the inconsistency that we students see from our perspective.”
Morey said that addressing efficiency and response time to work orders are his primary goals. During his first two weeks on the job, Morey instructed his staff to work on the completion of a work-order management system.
“It will allow us leverage technology to better manage the execution of the thousands of work orders we receive each month and to set clear organization priorities,” Morey wrote.
Morey is on the way to achieving this goal, as facilities will begin to test Archibus, a work-order management system that will allow students and faculty members to track requests, this summer with the goal of campus-wide implementation by fall 2013.
The Georgetown University Student Association will collaborate with Morey in a working group on facilities, which, GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) said she hopes will provide a forum, fordialogue between students and facilities administrators.
“We are very excited to have the opportunity to get in on the ground floor, so that students can play a major role in facilities issues right away,” Gustafson said.
Morey added that facilities plans to develop a client satisfaction survey and hopes to use the results from this and other metrics to gauge how to improve the department’s relationship with the Georgetown community, especially as the university looks to to expand its footprint in Washington, D.C., with a new property of about 100 acres to house graduate programs.
“Moving forward, I envision two primary goals: delivering outstanding client services which exceed the expectations of our clients and implementing and supporting the development plans focused on a student-centric living and learning at main campus and strategic growth of the next 100 acres,” Morey wrote.

Public safety alerts issued by the Department of Public Safety generally report recent crime on or surrounding Georgetown’s campus. A PSA released Feb. 9, however, warned the community of potential criminals targeting university students with specific physical descriptions of the suspects.
The PSA was issued based on a tip received from Chris Scott (COL ’14), who overheard the suspects described in the alert discussing intended crimes on a train last Friday afternoon.
“Two individuals got on at a stop, and one sat down on the seat in front of me and one sat down on the seat next to me,” Scott said.
While the men initially discussed other topics, their conversation shifted to money, after which a third man said that Georgetown would be a good location to stage burglaries because of the number of wealthy students.
“They sat down and they started talking about how they were going to get their money this week, and then they started talking about the last college I guess they had [burglarized], Catholic University,” Scott said. “They said that they liked to take things from people … not [just] that they liked to, but that they do.”
Scott reported what he heard to DPS as soon as he arrived on campus. The next day, DPS released descriptions of the individuals to the community, describing both as dark-skinned black males, one in Oakley goggles with dreadlocks and another in a yellow hood.
According to DPS Chief of Police Jay Gruber, the department disseminates alerts when it believes the information could be used to help keep the community safe.
“In many cases we are mandated [legally] to send the messages.” Gruber said. “In other cases, we send messages when we feel that we have important safety information to provide to our commnity.”
Gruber said this was the thinking that led to the dissemination of a detailed suspect description in Saturday’s alert.
“We received information and it came from a credible source and we thought it was important to share that information with the community rather than keeping it to ourselves,” Gruber said.
Gruber is one of the decision makers when the university considers whether to issue an alert. Other key groups involved include DPS, the Office of University Counsel, the Office of Communications and the Division of Student Affairs. Although many people take part, Gruber emphasized that this does not slow response times.
“It’s a process that happens very, very quickly,” Gruber said. “The leadership group, when they get the drafts of these messages, are very quick to engage and get these messages out.”
However, DPS does not issue PSAs for crimes with known suspects who have been apprehended — as was the case with Wednesday’s arrest of James McFerguson, who attempted to break into university townhouses on the 3600 block of Prospect Street — or when an alert would jeopardize an ongoing investigation.
“If there’s something of an investigatory nature that we feel would compromise an investigation but not endanger the public, we probably would not release that,” Gruber said.
Five PSAs concerning residential burglaries have been released so far in 2013, describing incidents inHarbin, Copley and McCarthy Halls. Descriptions of the suspects in those crimes have not been released to the public, although key people, including security guards are aware of what they look like. He said he would check with his leadership staff to see who needed to receive the information. According to Gruber, one of the burglars is female and the other is male, but the two are believed to be operating separately.
“We know what they look like, but we just haven’t found them yet,” Gruber said.
Gruber maintained, however, that it is important for students to receive detailed descriptions of perpetrators.
“To withhold descriptors on race, whether it’s a male or a female, whether the person is tall or short, would be doing a disservice to the community,” Gruber said. “We take the information that’s given to us. … It has nothing to do with whether we’re being sensitive to diversity.”
Some students voiced discontent with the contents of Saturday’s PSA on a Facebook group for Georgetown transfer students, on which Scott had posted a warning about what he had overheard on the train last Friday.
Justin DeLoatch (COL ’14), a member of the Facebook group who commented on Scott’s post, said he believes that the public safety alert would have been just as helpful without the physical description of the suspects.
“As a black man, it makes me feel uncomfortable to walk around campus knowing that this is what people are looking for,” DeLoatch said. “I have braids that most people mistake for dreads, and [the alert] didn’t say anything about dread length.”
DeLoatch said that it was important that students receive the information but thought the public safety alert could have been worded differently.
“I think the idea and the intent were good,” DeLoatch said. “I think it’s very important that — even if it’s just speculation — if you hear about something possibly going on campus, it’s good to give everybody a heads up. [But] I think a better way to go about it would have been to say we have some uncorroborated sources that say that there’s a possibility that people may be looking to target Georgetown students.”
DeLoatch sent an email to DPS voicing his concerns but has yet to hear back.
“Providing the descriptions they had without any distinguishing characteristics basically just described any of the black men that live on campus,” DeLoatch said.
Other students were grateful for the alert.
“I had my laptop stolen last semester, so I speak from experience that I think some kind of warning would have made me a bit more attentive to my belongings,” Joseph Gruenbaum (COL ’15) said.
But Gruenbaum noted that the controversy surrounding it reflected a larger issue on our campus.
“But then again I do see the problem. I think that the problem that people see with it reflects the larger division in Georgetown’s campus,” he said. “I think we’re still pretty racially divided and that’s a very big problem.”

Georgetown University Student Association executive candidates tackled feminist issues and addressed shortcomings in university policies on new student-run blog “Feminists-at-Large” this week.
Most of the candidates focused on the high percentage of sexual assault cases that go unreported — approximately 96 percent according to the American Association of University Women — and entertained concrete ideas for change.
Vice presidential candidate Maggie Cleary (COL ’14) stressed the relationship between victim stigmatization and the high percentage of unreported cases each year.
“It’s never easy to start these discussions,” Cleary wrote. “There is too much fear and shame and stigmatization surrounding issues of violence and assault to ever make it easy.”
Cleary called for a safer environment on campus.
“Sexual assault is not even exclusively a university issue; it’s far bigger than that,” Cleary wrote. “However, so long as we are students in a university, we have a responsibility to create solutions for our community, solutions that will start here and expand.”
Overall, Cleary emphasized the universality of the sexual assault issue.
“This is not a women’s issue. This is not a men’s issue,” Cleary wrote. “It doesn’t matter if you are young or old, rich or poor, cisgendered, transgendered, liberal or conservative. Sexual assault has no left or right; it is always wrong and always hurtful both to the victim and the community.”
Presidential candidate Spencer Walsh (MSB ’14) and running mate Rob Silverstein (SFS ’14) also wrote about promoting awareness and facilitating incident reporting.
“We believe that the university must do more to address sexual assault, and we will partner with campus groups like Take Back the Night and GU Men Creating Change to pressure officials from President DeGioia downward to become more forthright on the issue,” the pair wrote. “Specifically, we know that increasing understanding of what consent really looks like among men and women across campus is key.”
However, the candidates diverged on potential solutions in their posts.
Cleary proposed a GUSA committee to analyze the university’s sexual assault policy, which would recommend changes, promote awareness and implement safe-space training sessions based on student input.
“This should not be a partisan issue; this should be about protecting half of our society,” Cleary wrote. “Georgetown is ready for this conversation, for this action, and I believe that together we can start positive change.”
Shavonnia Corbin Johnson (SFS ’14) and running mate Joe Vandegriff (COL ’14), as well as Walsh and Silverstein, suggested a sexual assault risk reduction workshop during New Student Orientation similar to Pluralism in Action. In the small-group setting of NSO, students would feel more comfortable asking questions, which would create a more effective experience.
“The importance of planning such a program for the NSO period is to make sure that students are aware of exactly what is not tolerated at Georgetown and so they can be explicitly aware of their rights,” Corbin Johnson and Vandegriff wrote.
In addition to the sexual assault NSO presentation, Walsh and Silverstein wrote about the current Safe Spaces program, which trains peer leaders to handle bias-related incidents and sexual assaults.
“One of the main things we want people to take away [from our post] is visibility on campus,” Walsh said. “The second step after visibility is recognition from the university, and this is by far the hardest part because no university, especially Georgetown, wants to admit that sexual assault is a big issue.”
Corbin Johnson and Vandegriff also proposed concrete suggestions for changes to university policy regarding sexual assault. The candidates suggested removing the threat of alcohol violations for women if they report that they were assaulted while intoxicated.
“Our goal is to remove every disincentive for women to avoid reporting assault,” Corbin Johnson and Vandegriff wrote. “By preventing women from being written up if they choose to report that they were assaulted while intoxicated, we hope to remove some of the barriers to accurately caring for survivors of assault.”
Similarly, Corbin Johnson and Vandegriff wrote that they wanted to raise the punishment for drunken sexual assaulters from the punishment for underage drinking or disorderly conduct to the harsher sexual assault charge. They stressed that the right to drink is a free choice for college students, but that students must take responsibility for choices make while under the influence.
“To that end, it does not seem acceptable to us that the gravity of the decision to sexually assault another person should be in any way lessened due to the consumption of alcohol,” Corbin Johnson and Vandegriff said. “We feel that the full weight of the punishment for sexual assault should be given, because no exceptions should be made. Sexual assault is unacceptable and there is no room for it at Georgetown.”
While other candidates focused on sexual assault, Cannon Warren (SFS ’14) wrote more generally about women’s issues on campus, affirming gender equality as a basic necessity for society and expressing confusion about the necessity of feminism.
“In a society like ours, that proclaims all as equal, one might think that the natural state of affairs would be equality,” Warren wrote. “So then the word just kind of feels unnecessary, like a big ‘duh.’ But for some reason it’s not? I don’t get it, nor do I get why other people aren’t just getting down with the program.”
Corbin Johnson and Vandegriff agreed, stressing the lack of women in student leadership positions on campus.
Warren proposed an additional screening process on CHARMS, the university’s freshmen roommate matching system. These “bigot boxes,” checkboxes asking if students were racist, homophobic, sexist, ableist or otherwise bigoted, would cause students to be automatically expelled once clicked.
“It sends a serious message that such behavior won’t be tolerated at Georgetown,” Warren wrote.
A post by Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) and Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) will be published Friday. According to Tisa, the post originally focused on the meaning of feminism for Tisa as a gay student, but after reading the other candidates’ posts, he decided to address the issue of feminism more directly.
“Here’s a problem, and here’s what we’re going to do to solve it,” Tisa said.
Tisa added that while feminism is important to him and Ramadan, it does not appear to be a large concern on campus.
“It’s kind of similar to the American dream. You have unalienable rights to do what you want to do,” Tisa said. “[But] there’s a community that really champions [feminist ideas], and then everyone else shies away from it.”
Blog co-founders Erin Riordan (COL ’15) and Kat Kelley (NHS ’14) stressed the importance engaging GUSA candidates in the dialogue about women’s issues.
“They’ve made a really great start at tackling feminist issues, especially sexual assault,” Kelley said. “There’s a lot of momentum around this issue [feminism] right now. Yet, there’s still a really big need for [dialogue about] this issue.”

After being closed for renovations last fall, the Shops at Georgetown Park are set to reopen this spring and will feature a lineup that has drawn criticism from area residents.
According to the president of the Citizens Association of Georgetown, Jennifer Altemus (COL ’88), the new stores coming to the mall include DSW, T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods, arts and crafts chain Michaels and high-end bowling alley and restaurant Pinstripes.
“We are excited to see Georgetown Park finally revitalized, and I am really looking forward to the bowling alley,”Altemus said.
Although CAG is enthusiastic to see the retail center open again in the spring, Altemus added that many Georgetown residents feel that these new additions to the mall are not well-suited to the area and have expressed their concerns to CAG.
“Most neighbors I have spoken with are disappointed in the store lineup,” Altemus said. “The discount brands don’t seem to be a good fit for Georgetown.”
Georgetown has a reputation for being a high-end shopping destination, and the neighborhood houses a long list of expensive vendors including Brooks Brothers, Kate Spade and Michael Kors.
Pinstripes has already run into problems; the establishment was opposed by Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E before being approved Jan. 15 by the Board of Zoning Adjustment, after promising to address noise complaints.
Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner Peter Prindiville (SFS ’14), however, did not share the neighbors’ concerns about the discount chains. He hopes the stores at the mall will attract new customers who live outside Georgetown.
“I think it’s important to stress that the Georgetown retail district serves the entire District and the metro region,” Prindiville wrote in an email. “Georgetown should be a welcoming and inclusive community. To say a certain retailer is beneath the supposed standard for Georgetown ignores a large portion of the residents living in our community who find it difficult to shop in Georgetown.”
Georgetown students seem to agree with Prindiville’s position and are excited to take advantage of the lower prices that the mall’s new line up will offer.
“I think it’s snobbery on the part of the residents here to be upset about stores like DSW coming to Georgetown,” Katie Mangialardi (COL ’16) said. “This is a great opportunity for Georgetown students because for years, the neighborhood has lacked low-priced discount stores. Personally, I know I am excited to hit up DSW.”
Others, however, can see how area residents would disapprove of the new stores.
“On one hand, it’s disappointing to me to hear such an elitist argument coming from some of the people who live in Georgetown, but on the other hand, I do sympathize with their side as well. If you were walking down M Street and passing by Dean & Deluca and then the Coach store, wouldn’t it be weird to suddenly see Marshalls?” De’ahna Johnson (SFS ’16) said.
Nonetheless, Johnson expressed enthusiasm for the arrival of the new merchants to the area.
“All in all, this is a college town, and although the neighborhood is one of the wealthiest in the country, Georgetown should have an interest in making its retail area more cost effective,” Johnson said. “I think the new mall will be a big win for students here when it opens.”

At a town hall meeting at the Black House on Wednesday evening, all five GUSA tickets were asked to explain how their respective platforms would address diversity issues and engage minority students on campus.
The discussion, which was the first of its kind and came amid a period of heightened dialogue about diversity and racial bias on campus, focused on engagement between student groups and free speech on campus.
The candidates engaged with an audience of approximately 30 students at the event, which lasted an hour and a half.
Black House resident Aya Waller-Bey (COL ’14) was approached by all of the GUSA tickets except for one to discuss diversity issues on campus and decided to hold the event at the Black House to bring these discussions to a wider audience.
“Quite a few [candidates] realized there were definitely issues at Georgetown they hadn’t talked about, and I thought it was important to have a forum where those issues could be discussed in a more transparent venue,” Waller-Bey said.
The Black House worked with the Georgetown University Student Association Election Commission to establish the event, which Waller-Bey hopes will become an integral part of the annual executive race.
Presidential contender Shavonnia Corbin Johnson (SFS ’14), who is the only black candidate running in this race, said the biggest problem at Georgetown is racial division of student groups. Spencer Walsh (MSB ’14), who running with Rob Silverstein (SFS ’14), agreed that there needs to be more interaction among student groups.
Presidential candidate Cannon Warren (SFS ’14), who is running with Andrew Logerfo (COL ’14), disagreed, emphasizing that students should be able to control the makeup of their groups.
“The main thing I would pursue is bias reporting and making the campus feel like a safe place to be who [you] are,” Warren said.
Logerfo, Nate Tisa (SFS ’13) and his running mate Adam Ramadan (SFS ’13), who work for  Students of Georgetown, Inc., were asked to account for the company’s relatively small number of minority employees and to explain what efforts The Corp has made to become a more diverse organization.
Ramadan, who is half Latino,, said that he was encouraged to apply to The Corp by his host at HoyaSaxa Weekend and has actively encouraged minority students to apply.
Logerfo countered that the proportion of minority students in The Corp is reflective of the university’s ethnic makeup.
“The numbers are very much in line with the university as a whole,” he said. “It’s fine if you see that as a problem, but I personally don’t see that as problem with the percentage of different ethnic backgrounds in The Corp. I think it’s more of a Georgetown-wide issue.”
Tisa acknowledged that bias exists within Corp hiring practices, which he said tend to reward those who come from more privileged backgrounds, and said his ticket would create a working group addressing socio-economic differences that sometimes cause some students to feel excluded from more expensive college experiences, like Corp Gala and the Diplomatic Ball.
“The problem is The Corp, GUSA … and a lot of these institutions with [similar hiring practices] are looking for a specific type of person who reminds them of themselves,” Tisa said.
Candidates were also asked how they would increase communication and discussion of diversity and bias between white and minority students.
Silverstein proposed introducing additional diversity training for all students after New Student Orientation. Ramadan said he and Tisa would pair up student groups to perform service projects together.
“Rather than Hoya Blue and GUGS that already have a relationship and work together, let’s have Hoya Blue and Korean Student Association,” Ramadan said. “Put groups together that may be a bit of an uncomfortable situation because they were never in that before — the results after would last for so long.”
Corbin Johnson said her involvement in the Asian American Student Association, Vietnamese Student Association and the Latin American Student Association are examples of leaving her comfort zone — something she would like to promote among all students.
The candidates also addressed other kinds of diversity, including social class and sexual orientation.
Most candidates voiced support for gender-neutral housing, but Appelbaum said his ticket opposes the initiative because it is inconsistent with core university values.
“Maggie and I know we don’t support gender-neutral housing across the board in all locations because of Georgetown’s Jesuit values,” Appelbaum said. “That’s something we respect. Georgetown’s Jesuit values are something that’s rooted in the university for a very long time, and it supports the idea of what Georgetown does, what students do and the life they want students to live.”
 
When asked how they would promote observance of Black History Month in February, candidates invariably advocated for increasing institutional support. Corbin Johnson underscored the importance of encouraging involvement from the black community.
“It’s important to first make the black community aware of the Black History Month,” Corbin-Johnson said. “I’d like to engage the neighborhood in meeting with the Black Student Alliance, the NAACP, the Black House, to get those students involved. And from there, we can take it to a larger level.”
Waller-Bey was satisfied with the Black House’s first foray into the GUSA elections.
“I was very impressed by the candidates. They were asked some challenging questions and they did very well,” Waller-Bey said. “Some people went in with a candidate they were hoping to support, and their opinion may have been changed by the discussion.”

Pay for staff and senior administrators will be frozen over the next fiscal year, while pay for faculty is still subject to increase. The decision came after university President John DeGioia’s five-year plan was passed by the board of directors on Thursday.
However, DeGioia may alter this plan to more equally affect faculty and staff in the wake of backlash from members of both groups.
The current plan, which seeks to eliminate the university’s $19 million deficit over five years, proposes a freeze in the merit pool for university staff, a fund from which employees receive merit-based pay increases. The plan stipulates that expenditures in non-academic university departments be reduced by 1 percent annually, projected compensation growth be decreased by $7 million and graduate student enrollment rise. Both tenure track and non-tenure track faculty are eligible for raises from separate merit pools, neither of which will be frozen under DeGioia’s current plan.
“In order to go from $19 million to no deficit in five years, we have to take action each year,” university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr said. “In our plan, we go from [$19 million to $9 million] in the first year, and then we reduce it in the following years. The one-year merit freeze is only one element to achieve this goal.”
In a letter dated Feb. 7, DeGioia explained the need for budget cuts during a difficult economic climate.
“These are very difficult decisions,” DeGioia wrote. “This plan will help ensure that we are not only adjusting to the economic climate, but leading in our sector. It will allow us to continue planned strategic investments in infrastructure and facilities, technology and academic growth as we strengthen our institution for future generations.”
DeGioia held two town hall meetings: one for executive leadership Feb. 7 and one for other faculty and staff Feb. 12. According to Kerr, Gaston Hall was packed for the second town hall.
Faculty and staff response was mixed during the town hall, according to School of Foreign Service faculty chair David Edelstein.
“I think one [response] was disappointment that we were in this position but also people understanding that this has been a hard time for different places,” Edelstein said. “I think the second reaction was the one that most people had, which was a reaction to the differential treatment of faculty on the one hand and staff on the other when it came to merit raises.”
Kerr justified the pay scale discrepancies by citing the innate difference between faculty and staff careers.
“Faculty is an industry that has a trajectory,” Kerr said. “At Georgetown, we compete in a very international market place for those faculty, so we have a competition issue in compensation because we’re competing with the best universities in the world. Our staff operate in a way that is much more tied to the regional economy, and it’s much more affected by the local economy.”
Edelstein said that many faculty were uncomfortable being treated differently from university staff.
“If we’re all in this boat together, then we should really be all in this boat together,” Edelstein said. “That sort of treating people differently in that way, I think it struck a lot of faculty uncomfortably.”
German department Chair Peter Pfeiffer sent a letter signed by 20 College department and program chairs to the university’s board of directors, expressing opposition to the pay freeze.
“[We asked] them to reconsider [the freeze] in recognition of the fact that there are some financial elements that need to be addressed, but doing it this way, which is a very divisive way of differentiating faculty and staff, which are both very important to teaching and research missions of the university, is unproductive and would have long-term consequences,” Pfeiffer said.
Additionally, the faculty senate unanimously passed a measure encouraging the board to resolve the university’s financial issues without seriously affecting lower-paid staff.
According to Kerr, the university implemented similar cuts in 2009, but they were not highly publicized and did not elicit a similar response. The cuts, proposed in response to the 2008 recession, included a one-year freeze on the merit pool for both faculty and staff.
“That, too, was differential treatment, but there wasn’t a big email from the president that came out, so it didn’t get the same attention,” Edelstein said.
Though Edelstein disagreed with elements in the five-year plan, he applauded the university for not laying off faculty or staff in response to the economic climate.
“To my knowledge … we’ve never had layoffs,” Edelstein said. “To give them the benefit of the doubt, I think the university has always tried to do this in a way to avoid layoffs, to let people keep their jobs.”
DeGioia emailed faculty and staff after receiving their responses, promising to attempt to restructure the plan.
“I know there has been constructive and active dialogue happening throughout our campus since our announcement last week, especially related to an upcoming delay in the merit pool for staff,” DeGioiawrote. “Respectful of your concerns about how we implement our financial plan, today I asked the executive vice presidents on each campus and our chief operating officer to work over the next few weeks to develop a plan that seeks to ease the burden on our employees, within the financial framework already developed.”
Edelstein said that such efforts would change important elements of the plan, including the merit pool freeze.
“I think the formula might change … but I doubt that the ultimate goal would change,” Edelstein said.
Kerr said that the updated financial plan, which campus leaders will submit to DeGioia by March 11, would seek to meet faculty and staff concerns.
“This is really about listening to the community, and this a part of the financial cycle,” Kerr said. “How we meet these goals is not set in stone.”
