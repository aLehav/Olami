The parents of Austin Tice (SFS ’02) wrote an open letter to President Joe Biden on Oct. 3, calling on his administration to prioritize Tice’s safe return to the United States.
Tice, who has been missing since August 2012, was kidnapped while covering the Syrian civil war, the summer after completing his second year at Georgetown University Law Center. Over a month after his disappearance in Darayya, a video published anonymously showed Tice blindfolded and surrounded by armed and masked men. While the Biden administration believes Tice is alive, no presidential administration has been able to bring him home. 
Debra and Marc Tice, Tice’s parents, published their open letter in The Washington Post on Oct. 3, specifically calling on Biden to engage diplomats and other U.S. State Department officials in an effort to help secure Tice’s release and return to the United States.
The Biden administration should prioritize Tice’s release because it has emphasized family protections and values, according to the Tices’ letter.
“In these early days of your administration, you have clearly messaged that family is at the core of your agenda,” the letter reads. “We believe that if Austin were a member of your family, all the Bidens would rally around and come together to bring him home. On Austin’s behalf, because you are president of the country he honorably served as a Marine Corps officer, we are asking you for that kind of all-in effort.”
The Tice family hopes that continued activism will ultimately help secure Austin Tice’s safe return to the United States, according to Debra Tice.
“We continue to relentlessly advocate for Austin’s secure release and safe return. We hope and pray he will soon walk free,” Tice wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Georgetown continues to support the Tice family’s calls for action from the Biden administration, according to Joel Hellman, dean of the School of Foreign Service.
“We at SFS stand with the Tice family in urging the U.S. Government to do everything within its power to bring Austin home,” Hellman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “His commitment to risk everything in order to expose the suffering of the Syrian people represents the true spirit of Georgetown.”
The Georgetown community has remained active in calling for Tice’s release. Georgetown community members sent letters to congressional representatives in April 2021, urging their representatives to call on the Biden administration to prioritize Tice’s return. 
Tice is also important to journalists around the world, according to Doyle McManus, director of Georgetown’s journalism department. 
“Austin Tice is important to the journalistic community, Austin Tice is important to the Georgetown community, and Austin Tice, at the end of the day, is important to all of us,” McManus said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “He was a journalist carrying out the search for truth, and it’s vitally important that the U.S. government do what it can to protect people who do that, or fewer and fewer people will ever be able to do that again.”
Despite activism for Tice’s return, Tice’s parents have expressed frustration over a lack of action taken to secure his release, according to a statement released Aug. 11, Tice’s 40th birthday. 
The U.S. government continues to commit resources to helping secure Tice’s release from Syria, according to a U.S. official. 
“We continue to emphasize that Austin’s release and return home are long overdue,” the official wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The Biden administration continues to call on Syria to help release Austin Tice and every American unjustly detained in Syria.”
The Department of State will continue to pursue all options, including actively engaging with Syrian officials, and aims to communicate directly with any people or organizations that can help Tice’s return, according to the official. 
“We are committed to following all avenues, including engagement with anyone who can help with Austin’s release and return home,” the official wrote. “We have been and remain open to direct communication with anyone who can help us bring Austin and other American hostages home.” 
The Georgetown and journalistic communities should still maintain involvement in the campaign to free Tice, according to McManus.
“The rest of us who are journalists or anyone else engaged in the search for truth owes a great deal to Austin Tice,” McManus said. “The very minimum that we owe to Austin Tice is to exert whatever effort we can to help get him released.”

Hi Abby:
I liked your story about Austin Tice. If you want to add a call to action for Georgetown community you can update it to let them know that there is now a petition on Change.org that has 113,000 signatures of people asking the Administration to prioritize  Austin’s case.

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) plans to hold a student referendum this fall to restructure the organization completely.
The proposed referendum would remove the division between the GUSA Senate and executive bodies, instead dividing the organization into various policy committees, according to GUSA Vice President Nicole Sanchez (SFS ’22). The referendum stems from several GUSA senators’ efforts over the past year to restructure the organization to foster more inclusivity and less hierarchy.
Restructuring GUSA will help increase accessibility and inclusivity within the organization, according to Sanchez, who has helped lead the restructuring project in the senate.
“We want to erase all these barriers, all these titles, all this bureaucracy that really prevents so many people from entering these spaces,” Sanchez said in an interview with The Hoya. “We are not senators; we’re students. We’re students fighting to be recognized, fighting to be seen, fighting to be heard.”
GUSA’s existing power structure lends the body no real advantages in actualizing resolutions, and restructuring would allow members to effect more meaningful change on campus, according to GUSA Senate Speaker Leo Rassieur (COL ’22), who supports the referendum.
“It’s time GUSA moved away from trying to emulate the government of a country,” Rassieur wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We would be much more efficient if we focused on developing and advocating for policy rather than passing legislation that, at times, can be unimpactful or difficult for the student body to engage with.”
GUSA leaders first began exploring ideas to restructure the organization in fall 2020, when they formed the GUSA restructuring committee, a group of 15 GUSA senators and executive members that meets weekly to discuss the restructuring process. Led by former Senate Vice Speaker Eric Perez (COL ’23) and Dakyung Ham (COL ’22), the committee is currently drafting the proposed resolution to restructure GUSA and will release the final text in the coming weeks, according to Ham.
The restructuring referendum will follow a different path than past student referendums because if successful,  it would directly change the GUSA constitution. Like a non-constitutional referendum, two-thirds of senators must first approve the text of an amendment in order to advance it to a referendum before the student body, according to the GUSA Constitution. However, in order for the results of a constitutional referendum to take effect, at least 25% of the Georgetown student body must have voted in the election.
Though the senate has not yet voted on the proposed referendum, it has already been met with some pushback from senators. The current proposed referendum is incomplete and does not address many important aspects, such as the finance and appropriations (FinApp) committee, according to Zev Burton (SFS ’22), who opposes the referendum.
“They worked for a year on this, they had meetings after meetings and they did their research, and that’s what they came back with — something that isn’t completed, something that hasn’t dealt with the primary role of the Senate, which is FinApp to fund the student organizations,” Burton said in an interview with The Hoya. “That’s half our job, and they don’t have an answer for that. They don’t have an answer for the constitutional council. They don’t have all these basic answers that for me should have been the first questions asked.”
In response, Burton plans to propose a resolution at the upcoming GUSA Senate meeting Oct. 17 that would provide an alternate format for the restructure.
The lack of inclusivity and accessibility within GUSA does not stem from the organization’s structure, but rather the leaders, according to GUSA Senator Fabian Sojos (COL ’23), who opposes the referendum.
“In my opinion, the current structure of GUSA has been rendered ineffective by the current GUSA Executive and Senate leaders,” Sojos wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Rather than follow the bylaws, these leaders have chosen to disorganize GUSA in order to de-legitimize its ability to function.”
If Burton’s bill to change the proposed restructuring procedure fails, members of the GUSA restructuring committee plan to formally release the text of the referendum in the coming weeks to ensure that it is included as part of the GUSA elections already scheduled to take place in November.
Regardless of opinions about GUSA, the student body should engage with the restructuring referendum, according to Rassieur.
“During my time at Georgetown, we’ve seen a dramatic shift in GUSA and students’ ideas about what representation and advocacy should look like,” Rassieur wrote. “The Restructure referendum is the culmination of those ideas, and I hope every student considers its merits and votes in favor of it in November.”

Former GUSA VP says 
October 20, 2021 at 8:59 am
This restructuring idea is a waste of time and effort and will weaken GUSA as an institution. 
Current GUSA members should stop pursuing this idea.

The Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy announced the creation of a new advisory board to focus on diversity and inclusion efforts within the school.
The McCourt advisory board will focus on various projects, including decreasing tuition barriers for students, doubling the size of faculty and expanding research opportunities. With the Oct. 4 announcement of the creation of the board, the McCourt School also appointed 17 inaugural members, including graduates, former government officials and business leaders.
The board members’ varied skills will allow them to support McCourt’s efforts to increase inclusivity, according to Maria Cancian, dean of the McCourt School.
“This inspiring and accomplished group brings a variety of lived experience and professional expertise, reflecting and strengthening McCourt’s commitment to diversity and inclusion,” Cancian wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The board will contribute their unique expertise and extend their networks to expand our issue-specific bench of experts and deepen the impact of their work, diversify experiential and career development opportunities for students, and further embed equity and inclusion within our school.”
McCourt’s goal to improve inclusivity will allow many more students access to public policy education, according to advisory board member Maria Ghazal (GRD ’90), a graduate of the school and senior vice president and counsel for Business Roundtable, a non-profit lobbying firm.
“I am eager to support the McCourt School’s strategic priorities, particularly the goal of one day eliminating tuition barriers for students seeking a public policy degree,” Ghazal wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I think this is one of the best ways we can provide opportunity to all students — and encourage the greatest diversity in our student body, including diversity of thought and professional goals.”
In recent years, McCourt has taken steps to improve inclusivity. In March 2021, Frank McCourt Jr. (CAS ’75), founding donor of the school, donated $100 million to the school, $50 million of which he committed to scholarships and financial aid. The McCourt faculty also voted last spring to add “engaging with bias” as a McCourt “foundational skill,” a set of core competencies emphasized in all degree programs. 
Increased diversity in public policy education will allow policymakers to understand the full impact of their decisions, according to board member Cecilia Muñoz, former White House director of intergovernmental affairs and former director of the White House domestic policy council under the Obama administration.
“I care a lot about how policy reaches people,” Muñoz wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Too often we think we have finished the work when we pass a new law, and we don’t pay enough attention to whether it has the intended effect on people’s lives.”
The push to expand the McCourt School’s focus on inclusivity comes as the school simultaneously seeks to increase its size and presence in the Washington, D.C. area. The school  announced plans to move from Georgetown’s main campus to the Capitol Campus as part of an initiative to expand to include an undergraduate public policy major for juniors and seniors.
The advisory board will assist the school’s creation of the new undergraduate program as well as the school’s move downtown, according to Cancian. 
“This group of leaders will support us in leveraging our new downtown location to build more dynamic programming experiences for our students; help strategize on new career pathways into policy making, public service and civil society for our students; and, more broadly, be ambassadors and champions for our school,” Cancian wrote.
The board’s wide range of expertise and experience will also allow the school to create more career and educational opportunities for students and improve community programming, according to the press release announcing the creation of the advisory board.
According to Ghazal, her career experience will help inform her role on the board.
“I would like to bring the insights I have gained at Business Roundtable to my work on the Advisory Board, including by encouraging McCourt students to explore opportunities in the business sector and helping students achieve a better understanding of how business and public policy interact with one another,” Ghazal wrote.
Ultimately, the advisory board will help bring about positive change within the McCourt school, according to Muñoz. 
“I’m hopeful that we will be thoughtful and systematic both about inspiring a broader array of students to imagine themselves in policy careers, and in addressing the obstacles that prevent the world of policymakers from being as diverse as it needs to be,” Muñoz wrote.

The Native American Student Council (NASC) called on Georgetown University to issue a land acknowledgment and officially recognize Indigenous Peoples Day.
On Oct. 11, NASC — a student group that advocates for Indigenous community members on campus — hosted an event in Red Square featuring three speakers from the organization. At the event, students demanded that university leadership officially acknowledge the Indigenous land Georgetown sits on, as well as officially recognize Indigenous Peoples Day as a campus holiday, which Georgetown currently calls a mid-semester holiday.
Georgetown’s main campus sits on land that belongs to the Piscataway and Nacotchtank tribes. NASC member Carson Ramírez (COL ’23) said during a speech that the colonial occupation of Indigenous land, both in the Washington, D.C. area and across North America, has led to a loss of Indigenous customs.
“Many customs with using nature and sharing with nature have been lost because of these breaches of land and overtaking of land,” Ramírez said.
The university is neglecting its responsibility to properly acknowledge the Indigenous land campus sits on and pushes a burden onto Native American students and faculty, according to professor of philosophy Shelbi Meissner, one of two Native American faculty members at Georgetown.
“The emotional, spiritual, mental, and physical labor that goes into crafting a meaningful land acknowledgment should not fall solely on the shoulders of Indigenous students or Indigenous faculty,” Meissner wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Not only does Georgetown have an abysmally small number of American Indian students (~10) and faculty (2) that would make shouldering this burden impossible, it’s also the ethical responsibility of those with institutional power and representation to invest in a land acknowledgment.”
The university is exploring programming with local Indigenous tribes, according to a university spokesperson. 
“We deeply respect and are open to engaging with the Piscataway tribe, whose ancestral lands include the District of Columbia. The university is extremely supportive of exploring programming, and course options that share our diversity, equity and inclusion values, and reflect the broad interests of our students,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In addition to the land acknowledgment, NASC demands the university change the name of the Oct. 11 holiday on Georgetown’s calendar from mid-semester holiday to Indigenous Peoples Day to recognize the Indigenous students on campus, according to NASC President Tristin Sam (SFS ’23). 
On Oct. 11, President Joe Biden proclaimed a federal observance of Indigenous Peoples Day, marking the first time a U.S. president has officially recognized the holiday. Sam said the news evoked a flood of emotions. 
“It’s a lot of mixed emotions. It’s a lot of strong feelings,” Sam said in an interview with The Hoya. “It’s both a celebration. It’s both mourning. It’s reverence. It’s a reflection. Overall it’s also an affirmation that we’re here, we survived, and I am a beneficiary of that survival, and all my friends and family have survived, and we are here, and we will be here.”
NASC has also called on the university to put more effort into recruiting Native American students. Native American students only make up approximately 0.1% of the student body, and the Indigenous community on campus lacks academic and cultural resources, according to NASC Vice President Alanna Cronk (COL ’23).
“Georgetown is very uniquely located in a very political place, and this is a school that people go to to become influential political figures, and so we want to make sure that that potential power is also being invested in the hands of Indigenous people,” Cronk said in an interview with The Hoya.
The Georgetown Office of Undergraduate Admissions says it is recruiting students from all backgrounds, according to a university spokesperson.
“Georgetown is committed to multicultural recruitment and supports prospective students from diverse backgrounds and geographic regions, including Native American students, throughout the recruitment and application process,” the spokesperson wrote.
Regardless of the university’s response, the NASC’s celebration of Indigenous Peoples Day marks a celebration of Indigenous land, culture and activism, according to Cronk.
“I think symbolically it’s important to do something just on Indigenous Peoples Day, even if not a single person came,” Cronk said. “To be on this land, and say the words that we did, I think is significant in itself.”

A newly proposed bill in the D.C. Council may provide Washington, D.C. residents with $100 per month toward public transit costs. 
Councilmember Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) reintroduced his Metro For D.C. legislation this month, which outlines a program that would create a fund to improve bus service and provide District residents with a $100 balance on a SmarTrip card every month. These funds could be used to ride the Metrorail, the D.C. Circulator and the Metrobus.
The plans outlined in the bill would make the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) more reliable, accessible and equitable in the District, which in turn will increase the number of people using public transportation in the long run, according to the Metro For D.C. information site.  
“It focuses on transit equity by improving bus service first in communities who have the longest commutes, often pay more per trip, and mostly live in low-income neighborhoods,” the site reads. “But the goal of Metro For D.C. isn’t just about growing ridership — it’s also about making our transit system more accessible for every D.C. resident.”
Recent policy changes, like the District Department of Transportation (DDOT)’s decision to reinstate fees for riding the Circulator, pose a financial barrier to accessing WMATA services, especially for low-income individuals.
Allen originally introduced the bill in March 2020; however, the council postponed it because of the necessity for urgent legislation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Following Allen’s initial announcement that he would reintroduce Metro For D.C., 10 of 13 councilmembers, including Ward 2 Councilmember Brooke Pinto (LAW ’17), announced their co-sponsorship.
According to Pinto, the Metro For D.C. bill would provide D.C. residents with access to Metro services, regardless of increasing costs or ability to pay.  
“All residents will have reliable access to transportation to work and around the city to visit, shop, and take care of their needs,” Pinto wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Costs in our city are rising and supporting the transportation needs of our residents is an important priority for the city.” 
According to the Metro For D.C. information site, the D.C. government will only pay WMATA when the services are actually used, so WMATA is still incentivized to improve and maintain services so potential riders want to use the $100 allocated to them for public transit use.
“If anything, it gives WMATA a great opportunity to earn new riders who suddenly have $100 to spend on public transit services,” the site reads. “It’s a market-based approach that gets WMATA and other agencies the opportunity to earn those riders.”
Metro accessibility has also been a concern for Georgetown University students. The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Election Commission announced May 1 that 84% of student voters who participated in a referendum were in favor of implementing the Metro U-Pass program, which would provide students with an unlimited number of discounted rides on Metrobus and Metrorail services. The university is considering adopting the program. 
The Metro For D.C. bill would lead to both economic and environmental benefits for the District, according to Pinto. 
“Increased ridership means that there will be fewer cars on the road and that D.C. will move closer to its sustainability goals — particularly as we move to electrify our bus fleet and use more energy-friendly train cars,” Pinto wrote. “Increased ridership can also lead to more jobs at WMATA and around the city as economic activity picks up.”
Pinto said that while there is no definite timeline regarding the future of the Metro For D.C. bill, continuing to support public transit opportunities is important. 
“Long-term community buy-in is needed to keep our transit system operating efficiently and effectively, and the Metro for D.C. program will help us get there,” Pinto wrote.

Good, informative article about the possible $100 support for DC residents riding WAMATA. We are especially interested in this as our members are always looking for cost effective transportation to doctor’s appointments, grocery stores and other necessary trips. And, the volunteer pool to take older people to their appointments has dwindled recently here in Glover Park. Whatever you can do to keep this in the public eye is great.

During this year’s D.C. Food Waste Week, local restaurants and online grocers saved over a thousand pounds of food waste. 
Imperfect Foods, an online grocer that seeks to limit food waste and promote clean energy, partnered with restaurants in Washington, D.C., from Oct. 4 to Oct. 10 to serve dishes using excess ingredients from Imperfect Foods. Furthermore, the grocer helped organize events throughout D.C. to educate the community about sustainability and resourcefulness. For every dish sold, Imperfect Foods donated $5 to D.C. Central Kitchen, a nonprofit that fights hunger and poverty.
According to a spokesperson for Imperfect Foods, the company aimed both to reduce and teach about food waste through D.C. Food Waste Week, which ultimately saved over 1,370 pounds of food waste.
“Americans waste up to 40% of our food supply, with 30% of it being wasted at the retail and consumer levels,” a spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Imperfect Foods is on a mission to eliminate food waste and build a more equitable supply chain, and invites the local community to start with digestible, daily efforts to mitigate food waste in their everyday lives to inspire a larger movement.” 
The United States generates 108 billion pounds of food waste every year, ranging in origin from farmers to manufacturers to the table. In 2018, D.C. reported 414 tons of food waste. Just one year prior, in 2017, D.C. officials launched Zero Waste DC, which brought together various D.C. agencies responsible for managing food waste and sustainability in an effort to move toward a zero-waste District. 
D.C. Food Waste Week served as a way to urge people to consider more carefully the food that they are eating versus throwing away, while also supporting an organization working to end hunger in the District, according to Melissa Gold, director of communications and marketing for D.C. Central Kitchen. 
“DC Food Waste Week was a great way to spotlight the issue & encourage people to think of sustainable solutions to reduce what we throw away each year,” Gold wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We were thrilled to team up with Impossible Foods for their efforts during the week and be a beneficiary of their generous support.”
Chaia Tacos, a vegetarian taco restaurant with a location in the Georgetown neighborhood, also partnered with Imperfect Foods to raise money for local food banks and to raise awareness of food waste in the District, according to Bettina Stern co-founder of Chaia Tacos.
“The extra-added bonus was that: for every ‘imperfect’ menu item we sold, IF donated $5 to a local food bank, as well,” Stern said in an email to The Hoya. 
According to their spokesperson, Imperfect Foods also focused on education during D.C. Food Waste Week by organizing interactive events and panels at local restaurants, which were centered around sustainability and improving culinary practices on a micro level in an effort to reduce food waste at home. 
“In addition to specialty menu items, Imperfect Foods in partnership with participating restaurants hosted consumer events throughout the week for Washingtonians to have the opportunity to join a larger conversation about food waste, starting with the local community,” the spokesperson wrote.
Collaboration between Imperfect Foods and local restaurants was possible as a result of their shared goals regarding cooking and food waste, according to the spokesperson.
“There is a lot of synergy between DC-based restaurants, chefs, entrepreneurs and the mission of Imperfect Foods,” the spokesperson wrote. “With a combined mission of making delicious dishes that not only taste good but make you feel good about the impact you’re making, Imperfect Foods was able to quickly garner support from some of DC’s most beloved kitchens.”
Outside of Food Waste Week, the District has organized opportunities for residents to lessen their food waste, such as placing drop-off locations for the disposal of compostable scraps at local farmers markets. By composting, residents can turn biodegradable trash into organic material that can serve other purposes.
D.C. Food Waste Week prevented more food waste than anticipated, demonstrating how much waste can be saved from landfills when an effort is made, according the spokesperson wrote. 
“The intended impact of the week’s event was to save 1,000 pounds of food waste,” the spokesperson wrote. “However, Imperfect Foods and Washington, DC exceeded that goal and saved over 1,370+ pounds of waste!”
This article was updated on Oct. 15 to remove the name of Imperfect Foods’ spokesperson.

The Georgetown University Prisons and Justice Initiative (PJI) opened applications for their first full bachelor’s degree program.
Applications for the PJI bachelor’s degree, a five-year program for incarcerated people, opened on Sept. 20 and will close on Oct. 29, according to Joshua Miller, director of education for PJI. Accepted students will take classes with Georgetown faculty starting in January 2022 at the Patuxent Institution, a treatment-oriented correctional facility, in Jessup, Md. Students are expected to remain in the program for five years and take a total of 120 credit hours, the same amount required for Georgetown undergraduates. 
Joe Napolitano, the assistant director of education at the PJI, said the program aims to transform the lives of its students during and beyond their time in prison. 
“We believe deeply in the value of a liberal arts education,” Napolitano said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We believe that it’s for anyone and everyone. In some sense, I want our incarcerated students to get out of their Georgetown degree exactly what we would want main campus undergraduates to get out of the degree.”
PJI will accept 25 people from across the Maryland prison system into the first cohort of students to complete the program. Those not currently in Patuxent will be transferred to the facility to complete the program. Participants will have the choice of majoring in either cultural humanities, interdisciplinary social science or global intellectual history. 
One of the program’s primary goals is to ensure that incarcerated students feel a part of the Georgetown community, according to Marc Howard, the founding director of the PJI.
“It’s to contribute to changing the narrative about incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people by showing that they have value and abilities that can be rewarded and supported and that they can become role models through the idea of second chances,” Howard said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
The new program is an extension of the PJI’s Prison Scholars program, which currently offers a number of both credit and noncredit classes and programs to incarcerated people in the D.C. Central Detention Facility. These include the Pivot Program, a certificate in business and entrepreneurship for formerly incarcerated people, and the Mayor’s Office on Returning Citizen Affairs (MORCA) and Georgetown Paralegal Program, which trains experienced previously incarcerated individuals for legal careers.
The PJI has worked over the past years to expand the credit options for the classes being offered to passionate and excited students, which has culminated in this degree program, according to Joshua Miller, the director of education for the Prison Scholars program.
“I can tell you pretty confidently, having been doing this for almost a decade, that these students are going to be phenomenal, they’re going to be excited and they’re going to be everything you expect from a Georgetown first-year student,” Miller said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya.
Students will begin the program by taking core classes similar to those offered on the main campus, including introductory philosophy classes and “Problem of God,” a required first-year theology course, according to Napolitano. 
The PJI is also collaborating with the Academic Resource Center (ARC), the library and various other research and tutoring programs to provide a full range of academic support, according to Miller. 
“The university community has been very supportive, from the College to the Provost to the President’s office,” Napolitano said. “Everyone has recognized that the work that PJI does is important and is deeply connected to the mission of the university. We couldn’t be more grateful for the support of everyone at Georgetown.” 
This program is deeply connected to the university’s Jesuit values and represents the core principles that Georgetown strives toward, according to Miller. 
“Education is a human right,” Miller said. “It is evident that there is a tremendous amount of potential inside, that there are intelligent, curious, conscientious human beings behind the walls, and we’re wasting all of the talent back there. We should work to end the systems that lead to so many of our fellow citizens being incarcerated.”
The PJI plans to expand the program to admit new cohorts of students in subsequent semesters to expand access to degrees for more incarcerated people, according to Howard.
“My hope is that in a few years from now, it’ll be a bustling educational environment with students hustling from class to class and discussing and engaging and learning and just being excited about the whole education process,” Howard said.

Median earnings depend on factors beyond level of education, and in some fields higher education does not lead to higher earnings, a new Georgetown University report found.
The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce (CEW), a research institute affiliated with the McCourt School of Public Policy, released the report “The College Payoff: More Education Doesn’t Always Mean More Earnings,” on Oct. 7, which evaluated the correlation between education attainment level and median earnings. 
The report found that 16% of workers with high school diplomas and 28% of workers with associate’s degrees amass more than half the lifetime earnings than those of workers with a bachelor’s degree. Additionally, 36% of holders of bachelor’s degrees earn more than half of workers with a master’s degree.
Higher education is not always the best option for students after high school, according to Ban Cheah, a research professor at CEW and one of the report’s authors.
“In a high-paying occupation or high-paying field, an associate’s degree can allow you to earn more than a median bachelor’s degree holder,” Cheah said in a phone call with The Hoya. “The college and postgrad path is not the path for everyone.” 
The research was conducted through a large survey of people across the United States, pulling from 11 years of data, according to Cheah.
“We just calculate the median earnings for each group of people,” Cheah said. “The drawback of this approach is that there isn’t really a real earning trajectory for people.”
While lifetime earnings are often greater for those with a higher level of education, there are clear exceptions to this trend, according to the report. 
“[O]ne quarter of workers with a bachelor’s degree earn more than half of workers with master’s or doctoral degrees,” the report reads. 
In addition to differences among fields, median earnings depend significantly on field of study, location, race, ethnicity and gender, and gaps persist between different groups, the report found. Women with a bachelor’s degree have median lifetime earnings of $2.4 million, compared to $3.3 million for men. While white workers with bachelor’s degrees earn a median of $2.9 million, Black and Latinx workers each only earn $2.3 million. 
The results of the study should be used to allow students to make better choices about their educational futures, according to Emma Wenzinger, one of the report’s authors and the Strategic Communications Specialist at CEW.
“This kind of information is very useful to the general public, young people looking at colleges and people later on in their careers looking at going back to school,” Wenzinger said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
The issue with lower earnings despite higher education comes from a lack of awareness among students regarding their educational options early in life, according to Cheah. 
“This is one of the reports that many high school counselors use,” Cheah said. “But they also use it in a pretty simplistic way in that going to college does pay off for a lot of students even though it might not for everyone.”
For instance, the research found that a professional degree in architecture and engineering occupations, such as a master’s of architecture, yields no higher earnings than a bachelor’s degree in those fields. However, a professional degree in health practice occupations yields more than twice as much in median lifetime earnings as a bachelor’s degree.
High school guidance counseling often does not educate students about all of their post-graduation options, making them feel pressured to enter college and pursue degrees even if it is not the best path for them, according to Cheah. 
“Counseling in its current state is just too narrowly focused,” Cheah said. “They are too eager to get their kids down the pipeline.”
Students should be made aware of other options because college can be costly, according to Wenzinger. 
“We think this data is important because earnings are certainly a big factor because college is a big investment,” Wenzinger said. “So it is just one piece of the puzzle but it is an important piece for college students to consider.”

CW: This article references violence in Afghanistan. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
Amid global crises, including the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, the United States must support immigrants and refugees from across the world, panelists said at an Oct. 7 event.
The virtual event, titled “Who is my Neighbor?” was co-sponsored by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., and the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life at Georgetown University. It was the first installment of “Pope Francis, Young People, and Solidarity: Dialogues on ‘Fratelli Tutti,’” a series of events which reflects on Pope Francis’ ‘Fratelli Tutti,’ an encyclical calling for human fraternity and rejecting war. 
Pope Francis signed “Fratelli Tutti” in October 2020, calling for greater solidarity among communities throughout the world. Francis asks people across the world to uphold basic human rights like access to food and water, and encourages communities to learn about one another. In the document, Francis also claims the global response to COVID-19 displays a lack of necessary international collaboration. It is Pope Francis’ third encyclical, a letter sent to all Catholic bishops by the pope.
To promote understanding between communities as Francis instructs in “Fratelli Tutti,” Americans must exemplify fraternity by providing support for refugees adjusting to life away from their home, according to Muzhgan Azizy, a refugee from Afghanistan who recently immigrated to the United States; Azizy worked for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and the Afghan Ministry of Agriculture.
“Me being new with the lifestyle, with the culture, with the systems here in the United States, affect my neighbors and the people around me, what I expect from my neighbors and people of this great country is to be patient with us, to support, to go through this difficult time of resettlement and adjustment,” Azizy said at the event. 
Following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, Afghan refugees make up one of the world’s largest refugee populations. In the last four decades, the United Nations reported that there are nearly six million Afghans who have been forcibly displaced from their homes. 
Afghans resettling in the United States have faced a variety of barriers, including delays in the visa approval process, which leaves refugees uncertain of their legal status and unable to access federal social programs like Medicaid. 
Nationalism, racist ideologies and apathy promote division in society, according to Omayma El Ella, the project associate for the Just and Inclusive Society Project at Democracy Fund, which seeks to protect the civil rights of groups targeted by hate and discrimination. 
“It has been heartbreaking to see members of our own faith communities at times swayed by nationalist, racist thoughts that pin us against one another,” Ella said at the event. “I think one of the challenges we are seeing in relation to addressing societal ills is something Pope Francis names in the encyclical, which is radical individualism.”
Nationalism is on the rise in the United States: In the past year, domestic terrorist plots and attacks in the United States have risen to their highest rates in 25 years. White supremacists are responsible for about two-thirds of these incidents.
Dialogue guided by compassion is the key to fostering friendship among strangers, according to Cardinal Wilton Gregory, Archbishop of Washington.
“The bedrock of friendship and reaching out to our neighbors is dialogue and relationship,” Gregory said at the event. “Dialogue is not a one-and-done conversation. It is a process. A process of discernment, accompaniment, listening and exchange.”
Young people have the power to spread peace and create a positive environment for refugees through compassion and bravery, according to Gregory.
“Pope Francis calls on all of us, especially our young people, to be creative and to be bold,” Gregory said. “The young people in our church are uniquely positioned to participate in civil dialogues and conversations in order to confront polarizing rhetoric, peacefully protest civil injustice and advocate for love of our neighbors.”

New Washington, D.C. legislation requires all riders to lock up rentable scooters after using them, prompting rider concerns about convenience and a lack of bike rack space.
The Council of the District of Columbia began requiring riders to lock rentable scooters to bike racks, scooter corrals, stop signs and parking signs starting Oct. 1. Scooters cannot be locked to private fences, gates, trees, bus stops or any other objects not authorized in the District Department of Transportation’s guidelines. 
The new law aims to keep D.C. streets clear and accessible by preventing electric scooters from littering the sidewalks, according to a Sept. 27 press release. 
“By requiring these shared fleet vehicles be locked to certain infrastructure, and making more of that infrastructure available, we are keeping our sidewalks and public places open and free from obstruction for all to enjoy,” Interim Director of the District Department of Transportation Everett Lott said. 
The new rule could become inconvenient if a bike rack is not in close proximity, according to Ryan Montgomery (MSB ’25), who uses electric scooters at least three times per week.
“I’ve only used it one time since I’ve had to use the lock, and there happened to be a bike rack right by where I stopped,” Montgomery said in an interview with The Hoya. “However, I could definitely see that as an inconvenience.” 
There are multiple electric scooter companies that service the District, including Lime, Helbiz and Bird, all of which are working to ensure that customers can lock and unlock the scooter through each company’s app.
According to Montgomery, however, companies like Helbiz have not properly communicated how to lock rentable scooters in compliance with the city’s new rules. 
“It’s not that having to lock the scooter up is frustrating, it is that Helbiz’s app doesn’t tell you to unless you have the most recent update,” Montgomery said. “I only figured this out after waiting on hold for 10 minutes with customer relations while my ride time was still going on.” 
The D.C. Council passed a bill in October 2020 requiring electric scooters to be secured and locked beginning in October 2021 in an effort to keep sidewalks clear for everyone, including individuals who rely on wheelchairs or canes. 
According to an Oct. 1 press statement from Helbiz, the locking system, which has been integrated into the existing app, will be user-friendly. 
“The lock-to mechanism will be integrated into Helbiz e-scooters, designed to secure parked devices to bicycle racks, signposts or other infrastructure throughout the city,” the press statement reads. “Once each ride is completed, the Helbiz App will activate lock-to and ask users to take a photo of the device to confirm it was parked and locked properly.” 
Despite assurance from electric scooter companies and the District that this regulation will not inconvenience riders, some riders have reported user issues in the days following the new rule, including concerns that locking scooters to bike racks may take away space on the racks needed for those using bikes or mobility devices. The October 2020 bill, however, required the Department of Transportation install 200 new racks every year until 2025 to create more space for electronic mobility devices like scooters.
The new law most likely will not inhibit ridership so long as D.C. provides enough infrastructure for riders to park and lock the electric scooters correctly, according to a Lime spokesperson.
“We expect this to have minimal impact for riders but we do hope the District will take the opportunity in this moment to expand parking locations like bike racks and parking corrals,” the Lime spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Lock-to works when the infrastructure to support it is there, and we look forward to working with the District to continue building safe streets and micromobility parking infrastructure.”
Now that the law has taken effect, there will be negative consequences if riders do not abide by the new regulations, so it is in users’ best interest to follow the rules, according to an email Lime sent to its users Sept. 28. 
“If you park responsibly, great!” the email read. “If not, we will have to remove you from the Lime platform — so, please park responsibly.”
