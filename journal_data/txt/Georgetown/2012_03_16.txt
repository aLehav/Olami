Georgetown will receive a verdict from the National Park Service on the possibility of building its own boathouse on the Potomac River — an initiative that has been in flux since the 1980s — by the end of the calendar year.
According to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr, Georgetown’s primary objective is to give its crew teams prime access to a boathouse on the Potomac.
The teams currently row out of Thompson Boat Center, which they share with crew teams from The George Washington University, area high schools and the surrounding community. The boathouse has been coping with overcrowding for several years.
The National Park Service recently began reconsidering a proposal to build a boathouse on the Potomac that would offer Georgetown crew teams a new home, but would be run by NPS and shared with crew teams at GWU and community members.
University spokeswoman Stacy Kerr stressed that there is no firm proposal for Georgetown to share a boathouse and that the university is still actively pursuing approval to construct a boathouse for its exclusive use.
“Our goal is to construct a boathouse of our own. … My understanding is that GW wants one as well, so they would presumably do the same,” Kerr said. “There is no proposal right now for GW and GU to share a boathouse.”
Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming said that the university has proposed to trade land currently in its possession for a tract on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, which it would use for the boathouse. This initiative was first proposed in 1998, and the university reached a preliminary agreement with NPS about the exchange. However, the approval process for a Georgetown boathouse eventually met resistance and was put on hold in 2008.
While Georgetown still intends to build its own boathouse on the Potomac River, Fleming said that collaborating to build a boathouse with other users would help to alleviate community concerns about the impacts of construction on the nearby area.

Two burglaries were reported at the Georgetown University Medical Center during spring break, bringing the total number of Med Center break-ins over the past two months to eight.
The first of the two burglaries occurred in Building D between 6 p.m. Friday, March 2 and 8:30 a.m. Monday, March 5, the Metropolitan Police Department reported.
According to MPD’s incident report, a suspect pried open the door to an office suite and took keys from an unlocked cabinet. The suspect then entered a locked room and stole a laptop worth $300. The office was left ransacked.
In the second burglary, which occurred the morning of Sunday, March 4, a suspect forced his way into several offices in the New Research Building. According to MPD’s incident report, the suspect broke open several locked desk drawers and caused $500 worth of damage but did not steal anything.
Neither MPD report contained descriptions of the suspects in either incident.
Since Jan. 21, the Department of Public Safety has reported nine burglaries at Medical Center buildings. Of these, four have occurred at Building D, four at the New Research Building and one at the Med-Dent Building.
The total cost of damage to offices and stolen goods in the eight burglaries is more than $2,300, according to MPD incident reports.
According to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, the Med Center established a security work team this January in response to the rash of burglaries.
The team is looking into ways to enhance security at the Med Center, including restricting access to buildings and offices and increasing data security, among other measures. In late March the team will submit a set of recommendations to address the burglaries, which the university plans to implement immediately.
Progress has been made on an investigation of a Jan. 26 burglary at the New Research Building, as two suspects who matched the descriptions of suspects in that burglary were detained by DPS officers Feb. 17 as they unlawfully entered the same building.
The suspects, who had been captured on video surveillance footage from Jan. 26, were described in a DPS public safety alert about the burglary as two black males between the ages of 35 and 40 driving a white, two-door pickup truck.
DPS notified MPD and barred the men from campus after the Feb. 17 incident.
According to Pugh, all of the Med Center burglaries are still under active investigation.

A student was physically assaulted in a burglary at an off-campus townhouse near the intersection of 36th and O Streets Wednesday night, according to the Department of Public Safety.
DPS reported in a public safety alert that the student confronted a suspect in the residence at 9:20 p.m. The suspect said he was looking for someone, but when the student asked to look into the suspect’s backpack, the suspect punched him in the face and fled the residence.
Two laptops, a camera and a watch were stolen in the burglary.
The suspect is described in the PSA as a 30- to 35-year-old black male of dark complexion and medium build, wearing a white shirt.
Though DPS posted the PSA on its website, it did not send an email alert to students. Typically, PSA emails are sent out for any kind of burglary or violent crime.
The incident Wednesday night was the fourth burglary in the area this week and is the 19th burglary to be reported by DPS since the beginning of the calendar year. By comparison, DPS reported a total of three burglaries during the same time period last year.
In the PSA, DPS stated that there have been eight burglaries at residences in the Metropolitan Police Department’s second district, which includes the Georgetown area, during the past two weeks.
DPS advised students to keep doors and windows locked at all times and cautioned against confronting burglars.

Ted Parker, technical adviser to the university’s co-curricular theater groups, will retire this semester after 13 years in the department of performing arts, leaving a legacy of strong collaboration with students.
Parker’s arrival transformed the department from a program with four staff members and no official academic program to a strong theatrical community backed by two majors and three minors, according to Director of Theater and Performance Studies Maya Roth.
Parker was inspired to teach after holding a substitute teaching position at a high school in Montgomery County,Md.
“I had been working with a graphic design firm, but I realized that it really wasn’t what I wanted to do, and I needed to be in the theater, and I discovered I needed to be with students,” he said.
According to Parker, his love of working with students played an important role in his decision to teach at Georgetown, at which both students and staff were involved in the interview process.
“Day to day, week to week, year to year, it just changes all the time, and that’s fabulous. The caliber of the students is just absolutely extraordinary,” he said. “I spend more of my time holding them back than egging them on.”
When Parker was hired in 1999, the performing arts department had no consistent venue for student productions. According to Roth, Parker was instrumental in advocating for the construction of the Davis Performing Arts Center.
Parker also supported Roth in developing an academic program that incorporates co-curricular theater groups. Beyond the establishment of an academic department, Parker has played a major role in establishing the theater community as one of collaboration.
“He brings a rich history and character to the department while still helping to [propel] things forward. He doesn’t mind getting his hands dirty and is often seen working side by side with a student, guiding them in learning a new skill,” Tobin Clark, production manager of the department, said.
At Georgetown, Parker has taught courses on production techniques, stage management and scene and lighting design while serving as technical adviser for the university’s co-curricular theater groups.
“Ted’s role in co-curricular theater is difficult to describe to anyone outside of that world. Even just the hours that he puts in are hard to believe,” Amelia Powell (COL ’12), executive producer of the Nomadic Theater, said. “He is always here late at night to attend our meetings and on weekends helping us build our sets and hang our lights.”
According to the students he has worked with, Parker’s extensive experience in design and production makes him an invaluable teacher.
“He’s a walking encyclopedia of theater,” Laurel Charnetsky (COL ’12), executive producer of the Mask & Bauble Dramatic Society, said. “I’ve helped in making a lot of sets over my years here and there seems to be nothing that Ted doesn’t know how to build. … He can tell you how every lighting instrument operates and the science behind it.”
Charnetsky also feels that Parker is able to uniquely connect with his students.
“When there’s a difficult situation and we’re not sure how to handle it, Ted is always there to ask for guidance. … And he truly cares about us, as people outside the theater as well,” she said.
Parker has been involved in performing arts in Washington, D.C., since 1968, working with the Kennedy Center, Washington Performing Arts Society and Ford’s Theater, among other organizations. He also co-founded The Actors’ Center, a nonprofit corporation that promotes regional participation in the performing arts.
Upon leaving the university, Parker plans to live part-time in the Languedoc region of France, due in part to its proximity to theater festivals.
“When you’re stopping doing something you really like, you need another adventure to look forward to,” he said.

For most participants in Alternative Spring Break programs, the experience lasts a week.
But for ASB leaders, the trips are the culmination of a process that begins almost a year before the first day of break, according to Ray Shiu, director of student leadership and special programs at the Center for Social Justice, which coordinates the ASB trips.
“This year’s leaders have been working diligently since April 2011 to prepare and plan for ASB 2012,”Shiu wrote in an email.
Alongside Shiu, leaders must negotiate trip fees and insurance policies and sign contracts with the organizations they will be working and living with.
“There’s definitely a lot of logistical stuff,” Sammy Magnuson (COL ’12), a leader for the Habitat for Humanity trip to Mobile, Ala., said. “Those are the kinds of things that you don’t really realize.”
While leaders work to coordinate the logistics of their individual trips, ASB’s planning committee oversees the marketing, fundraising, training and reflection aspects of the trips overall.
According to Marketing Chair Sarah Mason (MSB ’12), the committee seeks to improve the program every year and ensure the trips are meaningful for students.
“For the Alternative Spring Break program as a whole, our main goal every year is to increase our outreach on campus and create as diverse an applicant pool as possible,” she said. “I made a point to reach people we hadn’t necessarily reached before.”
Mason hopes that the program will expand to ensure that future trips will be open to more students.
“Ideally, it would be great if everyone who applied could go on a trip,” she said. “It’s really hard to be selective when everyone you’re choosing from is committed to give up their spring to volunteer or perform some kind of service.”
According to Magnuson, planning isn’t just about hammering out the details and making sure the trips runs smoothly.
“I think that it’s really important that the planning board really instills in the leaders a deep sense of purpose for the trip,” she said.
Manguson also highlighted the importance of establishing clear goals for the trip.
“I think that what I really try to emphasize [to students] is … ‘why does it matter that you are specifically here?’” she said.
Despite the obstacles, trip leaders said the organization process is a rewarding one.
“I think for people that want to be leaders, it can sound intimidating — the amount of time that goes into it — but the more work you put into it, the more you get out of it,” Becca Egan (NHS ’13), Magnuson’s co-leader on the trip to Mobile, said.
Magnuson agreed.
“You have to put in meaning to get meaning out,” she said.
Manguson added that ASB trip leaders experience the same personal growth and get the same opportunity for reflection as participants.
“I came out with just as much and I learned just as much as everyone else,” Manguson said. “There were some very thought-provoking conversations. Not only did it make the work more meaningful, but it also made our Georgetown experience more meaningful.”

Seven college students, including five Georgetown students, were arrested for underage drinking and using fake identification at Rhino Bar and Pumphouse on M Street Saturday, according to Erin Mathieson, an investigator for the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration.
Mathieson said representatives of ABRA’s D.C.: Double Check 101 program work closely with the Metropolitan Police Department to identify underage drinkers in bars and nightclubs surrounding university campuses in the District.
She added that ABRA apprehended two underage Georgetown students in Towne Wine & Liquors on Wisconsin Avenue for purchasing alcohol with fake IDs last month. Though the students were not arrested, Towne was charged and the students’ names were sent to the university. Penalties for serving underage drinkers range from a fine to a suspension of the establishment’s liquor license.
Mathieson said that while MPD must witness students’ use of fake IDs in order to charge them, they can obtain warrants to request identification from individuals who appear underage. Representatives of ABRA, however, can ask anyone to present identification. If the ID is deemed fake, ABRA will take down the student’s personal information and charge the offending establishment.
“We are primarily interested in documenting everything and charging the establishment, because [serving minors] is an egregious violation,” Mathieson said.
Mathieson added that an offending student’s personal information is forwarded to his university, where he often faces disciplinary sanctions.
According to Mathieson, ABRA targets establishments based on tips from D.C. universities and students.
“Sometimes students will … give us information. [They’ll say,] ‘Hey, you know, my friends go to XYZ bar. I know someone who goes here all the time.’ They’ll give us that information that way. That’s how we monitor specific locations,” Mathieson said.
A representative of ABRA will be stationed in Red Square Friday afternoon to answer questions about underage drinking, drinking laws and the role of ABRA as part of the administration’s efforts to educate students about underage drinking.
Mathieson said ABRA and area universities hope that the information provided by the program will enhance safety and alleviate concerns associated with underage alcohol consumption in addition to reducing the use of fake IDs.

After student protest when the university announced that residents of LXR Hall and Nevils would not have air conditioning until May, administrators said they would install a temporary generator-powered chiller next week.
Heat has been turned off in both buildings and fans have become available to all rooms that request them.
Pedestrian access through the LXR and Nevils courtyard was restored Wednesday, marking the end of one stage of the renovations to East Campus. The next steps for the renovations include the replacement of the emergency generator and the chiller, which controls the air conditioning for East Campus.
Permanent replacement of the chiller, which failed after Nevils’ interior renovations were completed last summer, is expected to be completed by early May.
“Replacement of the chiller was not a part of the scope of the Nevils renovation,” Vice President for Facilities and Student Housing Karen Frank wrote in an email.
Pedestrian access through the courtyard will be maintained while the building’s temporary air conditioning is installed, according to an email sent by Executive Director of Student Housing Patrick Killilee to residents of East Campus Wednesday evening.
Students reacted vocally to the initial news that their dorms would not receive air conditioning until mid-May, as temperatures reached 80 degrees Fahrenheit early this week.
LXR Hall resident David Schaffer (COL ’14) drafted an open letter to the Office of Student Housing that he submitted Wednesday afternoon. According to Schaffer, students are entitled to demand that the lack of air conditioning be addressed based on the over $4,000 that residents of LXR Hall and Nevils pay for housing each year.
“I think that asking for accommodations on the pricier side is not unreasonable,” he said.
Schaffer drafted an open letter online and posted it to Facebook Wednesday. At press time, it had received 369 signatures from East Campus residents, sympathizers and a self-identified medical professional.
Student complaints also received university attention through Hoya Ideas Community, an online student feedback portal. A post submitted by Michael Crouch (MSB ’13) received over 85 votes and currently has been designated as “in review” by the university.
With the restoration of part of the courtyard, the security doors on N Street and 36th Street will be closed and their emergency alarms will be reinstalled. Students must enter LXR Hall and interiorNevils apartments through the Walsh lobby or the 35th Street entrance.
The Office of Student Housing also cautioned that construction noise and brief disruptions to pedestrian walkways are to be expected. Part of the courtyard between Nevils and LXR will remain fenced as well.
Renovations to East Campus began last summer, when Nevils apartments received new furniture, lighting and windows, renovations to their bathrooms and kitchens and updates to the fire alarm system.
According to Frank, all renovations to East Campus are on schedule.

David Solomon (MED ’12) gained national recognition for his research on the genetics of cancer last Friday when he won the Harold M. Weintraub Graduate Student Award.
The award, which is sponsored by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Wash., recognizes achievement in the study of biology. Solomon and 12 other recipients will present their work at a symposium being held at the center on May 4.
The award is a special recognition of Solomon’s years of continual research on a gene that can cause brain tumors and other types of cancer.
Two years ago, while working in a lab that studies brain tumors, Solomon discovered a gene whose mutation may account for the abnormal number of chromosomes found in virtually all types of cancer.
“I was doing … an analysis of brain tumor samples to identify new potential cancer genes [and] I stumbled upon a gene that appears to be important in the development of cancer by causing abnormal chromosome numbers,” Solomon said.
Solomon spent the next two years working on a paper about the gene, STAG2, which was eventually published in the prestigious journal Science in August 2011.
According to Todd Waldman, an associate professor at the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center who mentored Solomon, the discovery is a critical step in cancer research.
“Early on in the discovery of the cancer gene, we knew it was a big deal. Once [Solomon] made the initial observation that the gene was mutated in a significant fraction of tumor samples, at that point, we knew the discovery was an important one,” Waldman said.
Solomon added that the discovery of the STAG2 gene is of particular importance because it mutates in a broad spectrum of human tumors, including the skin cancer melanoma and the bone cancer Ewing’s sarcoma.
“All cancers from breast cancer to colon cancer have an abnormal number of chromosomes. It is a fundamental feature of cancer biology. This discovery is a potential explanation for why that happens,” he said.
While Waldman lauded Solomon’s discovery, he added that much more about the subject remains undiscovered.
“It definitely is a major hurdle that has been overcome … [Solomon’s] discovery makes it possible for us to look for those novel therapeutics that could kill cancer cells that have the wrong number of chromosomes,” he said. “Still, there is a lot of work ahead.”

Results of a survey conducted by the Bachelors of Foreign Service Review Committee suggest student desire for more student space and core curriculum reform.
Results of the survey, which was conducted last semester, were released Wednesday.
According to SFS Academic Council President Lucas Stratmann (SFS ’12), the survey was drafted by the academic council in order to better include student input in the work of the Review Committee, which was established last spring to re-evaluate the overall BSFS experience.
“It’s worth noting how many students actually participated. It’s 453 students, which is a lot taking into account that the survey was really long,” Senior Representative Leticia Ferreras (SFS ’12) said. “It only shows that the SFS students are interested in improving the SFS education.”
The survey was sent to all 1,590 undergraduates enrolled in the SFS.
The report summarized student responses to questions pertaining to the core requirements, language proficiency tests, majors and certificates offered, teaching methods, research opportunities, accessibility of professors and student space.
An overwhelming majority of the students called for a prepaid printing system like the one offered to McDonough School of Business students. In addition, 83 percent of respondents believe that the SFS needs a common space for undergraduate students.
In the evaluation of the freshmen experience, 63.8 percent of the students reported viewing upperclassmen as an accessible resource for advice, but only 20 percent believed that the peer mentor program effectively provided support.
“There is a discrepancy between the institutionalized attempt to form this upperclassmen and underclassmen mentorship and the actual demand for the mentorship,” Stratmann said.
The report suggested that the peer mentor program move away from assigning mentors based on pro-seminars toward a more interest-based system. The report also advocated decreasing the ratio of mentees to each mentor.
“A good number of the students did not choose to be in the particular proseminars they were placed in,” Stratmann said. “The allocation of mentors and students is sort of random.”
The SFS is currently considering plans for a science requirement in the curriculum, but 51.8 percent of the respondents do not support such an addition. However, only underclassmen responded to the question about a science requirement because a technical error did not include the question in the version of the survey sent to upperclassmen.
“I don’t think [the data] would have been much different if upperclassmen also responded,” Stratmann said.
However, Azi Hussain (SFS ’15), a freshman representative on the Academic Council, said that the exclusion of upperclassmen from the question skewed the data towards opposition to a science requirement.
“I think upperclassmen would have understood more [of the role] science plays in international affairs and what such a requirement would consist of,” Hussain said.
According to the survey results, students were generally satisfied with the core curriculum. Among respondents, 70.1 percent of the underclassmen found the variety of core classes satisfactory, and 90.6 percent of the upperclassmen believed the core built a solid background for an international affairs education.
Underclassmen and upperclassmen, however, diverged on the relevancy of the core classes. While 38 percent of the underclassmen believed that some core classes are irrelevant, 59 percent of the upperclassman described them as unnecessary.
“This trend can be explained by the fact that as you become an upperclassman, you realize there is little room to pursue classes you are interested in because of the heavy requirements,” Senior Representative Joaquin Ormeno (SFS ’12) said.
The report also reflected a general call for reforms in the SFS core curriculum. Complaints included the discrepancy in the materials used by professors teaching different sections of the same class, redundant information in the four economic requirements and sometimes-unhelpful teaching assistants for large lecture-style classes.
Stratmann said that though the suggestions require long-term collaboration and conversation between the faculty and students, concrete change is possible.
The Academic Council will host town halls to discuss specific issues from the report.
“We do realize it’s not something that we publish today and happens tomorrow, but we’re committed to following up and keeping the conversation going,” Stratmann said. “The survey will allow us to have the expression of opinion which we can leverage and influence the SFS agenda.”
