Bon Appétit Management Company will manage the pub in the Healey Family Student Center, replacing Mason Inn owner Fritz Brogan, who backed out of the project in December, the university announced Tuesday.
Bon Appétit currently services over 500 restaurants and dining halls, including those at Johns Hopkins University, the University of Pennsylvania, Google and eBay. The company will develop a menu specific to the pub, which is set to open along with HFSC in the fall.
“Bon Appétit offers a robust program, and the committee reviewing pub vendors really thought the program they offered would enhance the current on-campus food offering for students the most,” Associate Vice President of Auxiliary Business Services Joelle Wiese wrote in an email. “I know I speak for many when I say we all want the pub to be successful — this is an exciting time for students. The pub will provide many wonderful memories for students and be a part of the campus for generations.”
The university had multiple criteria for a pub vendor, including late-night hours for students who are 18 years or older, a carry-out window, openness to student employees and engagement in student opinion, according to Wiese.
“These were all factors in the selection of the pub vendor, along with design and concept ideas, menu input and overall approach to the restaurant business,” Wiese wrote. “There were many great vendors that were part of the process, and we thought that Bon Appétit was the best match for the students of Georgetown.”
While Brogan’s original plans for the HFSC space included a restaurant, the switch to Bon Appétit puts the pub in the hands of a vendor with a markedly different background. Bon Appétit is better known for its food, often in dining hall settings, while Brogan came to the project with a background as a local bar owner.
In planning forums over the summer, Brogan presented a vision for the pub as a gathering space for Georgetown students that would remain open until 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. on the weekends, with late-night food also available. Brogan even floated the idea of staying open 24 hours if encouraged by student demand.
Under Brogan’s plan, the pub would also have served brunch, including mimosas and Bloody Marys, on the weekends, and included a catering arm for both food and alcohol. Brogan described the restaurant as relying on “Chipotle-style service” in August.
Bon Appétit’s background, by contrast, is more similar to a traditional large-scale food vendor, focusing on “corporations, universities, museums and specialty venues,” according to its website. Chefs customize menus for their customer base at each location, and the company’s focus is food rather than alcohol.
The university hosted a pub showcase Wednesday in Sellinger Lounge and the Leavey Program Room, where students could see pub designs, sample Bon Appétit food, apply for jobs and vote for names, designs and themes for the location.
“The pub showcase was held to provide students the opportunity to experience the pub as much as possible at this point in the process,” Wiese wrote in an email. “The student pub is for ‘the students,’ if you think about it, how could we not do the pub showcase?”
Emily Herman, a freshman at Johns Hopkins University, eats food provided by Bon Appétit almost every day in her dining halls.
“Although it’s not perfect, I think Bon Appétit does a pretty good job overall with providing many fresh and healthy options,” Herman said. “I love that they often serve seasonal, local vegetables. Also, the baked goods here have been so good recently that the baker has his own cult following.”
Grace Memmo, a freshman at University of Pennsylvania, said she enjoys the customization and variety that Bon Appétit provides to her dining halls.
“They’re very big on getting locally grown food, and we compost, so that’s good too. Also, they can have delicious specialty items and good pasta and salad bars and make customized food,” Memmo said.
Architects from Buell Kratzer Powell, who are collaborating with Bon Appétit to create an ideal space for both groups, spoke to students at the showcase. Darrell Kratzer and Caitlin Daley, architects for the group, said that they tried to give the pub a community atmosphere.
“We really wanted a pub feel, a place that felt almost like a local bar that you really want to go to and spend some time in and meet your friends,” Daley said.
The architects decided to use natural materials, including a thick distressed wood bar top.
“We like natural materials,” Kratzer said. “We looked at some materials that are in the great hall [Healy Hall] and we will be incorporating some of that in the bar, like stone and wood and a very thick wood bar top.”
Both architects said that their favorite element of the pub is a wall constructed of kegs, which will also serve as a room divider. The wall will create the “Blue Room,” a separate space designed for student rental for parties and events.
“We’re both really excited about the keg wall,” Daley said. “We think it’s a really unique design element and something that people can really look back on and say ‘Remember the pub? Remember how great it was?’ It’s great because it does provide that functional element to make a space for the Blue Room. We’re pretty pumped about it.”
Kait Wilde (MSB ’17) attended the showcase to learn about the plans for the pub.
“I like that the student body is encouraged to get involved in customizing the pub by selecting fabrics and choosing a name,” Wilde said. “I can see myself going there with friends on the weekends and expect it to be both welcoming and successful. For me, the Nutella milkshakes sealed the deal.”

After considering the possibility in recent weeks, administrators confirmed Wednesday that students beginning with the Class of 2017 will be required to live on campus for three years.
The decision has upset some current freshmen, who think that the policy should be delayed to affect only students who have not yet arrived at Georgetown. The Freshman Class Committee created a Facebook event Thursday entitled “Change 3 Year On-Campus Housing Requirement for Class of 2017,” which had around 160 attendees as of Thursday night.
“When the email came out, it was like a bomb went off,” Freshman Class Committee Vice Chairman Nicky Rault (SFS ’17) said. “Everyone was going crazy that something had happened. The immediate feedback was pretty abrupt that students are not happy with this policy.”
The policy change is part of the university’s efforts to meet the requirements of the 2010 Campus Plan agreement, which obligates the university to move 385 students on campus by fall 2015 and house 90 percent of students on campus by 2025. Other components of these efforts include the renovation of Ryan and Mulledy Halls — the former Jesuit Residence — into dorms, the construction of the Northeast Triangle Residence Hall for fall 2016, the temporary conversion of two floors of the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center into dorms for the 2015-2016 academic year and added capacity to existing residence halls.
“One of the campus plan commitments we made was to bring more students back to campus,” Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said. “In our view, the requirement is part of this whole set of changes and enhancements.”
At this time, students are guaranteed only two years of on-campus housing, though most do not run into trouble securing housing for junior year. The new policy will extend that guarantee to three years.
Currently, most juniors live on campus with some choosing to move off campus after only two years in campus housing. Many seniors live off campus, a trend that will not be limited by this policy.
“This is a requirement, but we’re also noting that it’s a guarantee that we’ll provide housing for students for three years,” Olson said.
The three-year requirement will be modified for transfer students so that all sophomore and junior transfers will be free to move off campus for their senior year, even if they have only lived in campus housing for one or two years. Similarly, time spent abroad will count toward a student’s three years in campus housing.
Georgetown University Student Association leaders favored postponing the policy by a year so that it did not affect current freshmen. While they were not successful in persuading administrators to do so, they were able to compromise on certain matters, including the policy’s approach to transfer students and study abroad. GUSA representatives also spoke to administrators about housing options students would prefer under the new policy, pointing to areas like the Leavey Hotel and Conference Center.
“One thing that really informed the approach that we took to this was the student desire for on-campus locations. What we really appreciate is that when we expressed to the university administration that we would prefer options that included Leavey and current residential space,” GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said.
Despite these considerations, some freshmen still find the new policy limiting. Rault said he felt that the policy is unfair since freshmen were under the impression that they would have the opportunity to live off campus after two years when they enrolled at Georgetown.
“Freshmen have been here for a year. They came here under the impression that they would have the opportunity to live off campus junior and senior year. Especially after this whole year where we saw at our friends’ houses or apartments off campus that this is a very different lifestyle than on campus,” Rault said.
Other students were in favor of postponing the policy for one year.
“I just think that if they want to institute a policy like this, it should definitely be done with a class that’s incoming rather than a class that’s already been here for a year and has seen what the upperclassmen have,” Grace Cole (SFS ’17) said.
Some students said that they felt that the administration neglected the concerns of students when they instituted the new policy.
“They could have just as easily pushed back the plan for one year. It wouldn’t have impacted the plan that much … and everyone would be happy,” Mitchell Tu (SFS ’17) said.
Despite GUSA’s failed efforts to delay the implementation of the housing requirement, the Freshman Class Committee plans to petition the administration to postpone the housing policy so that it begins with the Class of 2018, according to Rault.
“The plan for now is to gather support for the Class of 2017 and then to meet with the appropriate administrators to see if we can compromise on the new policy,” Rault said.

PNC Bank will replace Capital One as Georgetown’s banking partner, the university announced Tuesday, with a Leavey Center office opening in August.
The switch ends Capital One’s 10-year relationship with Georgetown, which the bank declined to continue in February.
A committee that included representatives from the Georgetown University Student Association, Department of Financial Affairs, Division of Student Affairs, Athletics Department and University Auxiliary Services voted for PNC Bank against eight other contenders. The university declined to disclose the other banks that it considered.
“A committee of Georgetown community members has unanimously chosen PNC Bank as Georgetown’s new banking partner,” Vice President of Finance and Treasurer David Rubenstein wrote in an email to members of the university community Tuesday. “The university’s banking committee found that PNC demonstrated the highest standards of financial stability for our community. … We look forward to working with PNC to provide our community with the highest quality banking system for their financial needs.”
Maggie Moore, communications officer for arts and sciences, said that the committee chose PNC Bank because it fit well with what Georgetown sees as its banking partner’s role.
“The committee chose PNC for their exceptional banking services and alignment with the university on important areas of scholarship and mission-driven programming,” Moore wrote in an email.
University spokesperson Stacy Kerr said that the committee had specific requirements in choosing a new banking partner.
“There’s a convenience factor that we’re committed to maintaining for our university. Also, special rates and special benefits for members, which makes it advantageous for members of our community to join with that partner,” Kerr said in an interview last month. “They also are very mindful of our population, and that for some people, maybe this is the first time that they’re having a bank account, and they’re sensitive and committed to working with our students and population on things like financial literacy, which is really important for financial planning.”
PNC Bank currently provides GOCard services for Georgetown and operates three ATMs on campus, in Darnall Hall, the Leavey Center and Village C West. Roger Wallace, vice president of corporate communications at PNC Bank, said that the bank is eager to further its relationship with the university.
“PNC is very pleased to be chosen as the bank for Georgetown University,” Wallace said. “We look forward to a long and mutually prosperous relationship, and I know we’ll be able to talk further about what we can do when we make an announcement in the next few weeks.”
The new partnership with PNC will include perks for students and faculty who create accounts.
“Students, faculty and staff are eligible for preferred benefits from the university’s official banking partner,” Moore wrote. “We’ve announced the partner and will be working with PNC to announce the range of benefits available through this partnership.”
Wallace said that PNC has plans to release details about benefits in the future, but is not yet ready to divulge them.
“There will be a lot of other programs and features,” Wallace said. “We probably don’t want to get ahead of the curve by talking about what all those things are until we make a public announcement. I can’t get into all the details, but they’re going to be good.”
The university began to consider new banking partners after Capital One did not apply to renew its partnership with Georgetown. Capital One Corporate Communications Officer Amanda Landers said that the bank enjoyed its relationship with the university, but made a strategic decision to move on.
“This was a difficult decision to no longer operate on the campus of Georgetown University and one that our Bank leaders did not take lightly,” Landers wrote in an email last month. “Our relationship with the university has been very positive over the last decade.”
According to Kerr, over 500 faculty members have an account with Capital One, as well as a number of students that is kept confidential. Students and faculty that currently use the bank will not lose their benefits, but they will have to bank in off-campus Capital One locations.
Former Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union CEO Chris Kelly (COL ’14) said before the PNC partnership was announced that the addition of a different bank to campus would not change GUASFCU’s strategy on campus.
“At first, we were trying to think of how it would affect us specifically, and really a bank is a bank is a bank, and the same reasons that we were better than Capital One as far as rates and having a much more lenient fee schedule, much lower fees, being students serving students and having student-centric hours,” Kelley said. “For us, the competitive dynamic really isn’t going to be much different because at the end of the day, it’s just another bank.”
Other students agreed that Georgetown’s new partnership with PNC will have a minimal effect because of GUAFSCU’s established presence on campus.
“I don’t think it will make much of an impact,” Grace Cole (SFS ’17) said. “I think it makes more sense to have a credit union and a bank involved rather than two banks and a credit union. Capital One was just sort of excess.”

Amanda Wynter (COL ’14) won the 139th annual Richard T. Merrick Debate Medal for the Philodemic Society this semester, becoming the first known woman to win the award. Wynter’s victory, coupled with the increasing female leadership of the society, demonstrates that the society — which was founded in 1830 — has deviated from the stereotypical “old boys’ club.”
“It was already really neat to be another woman representing [the Philodemic] population on campus,” Wynter said. “To win … was a lot less for me and more for the idea for plurality and that we have a number of good speakers that look very different in all different ways.”
The Merrick Debate, which took place April 12, marks the culmination of the spring semester, with keynotes delivered by the four Philodemicians with the highest accumulation of points from weekly debates.
“This is the highlight of our spring semester, and most people consider it to be the highlight of their Philodemic career if they’re actively involved,” Philodemic Treasurer Abby Grace (SFS ’16) said.
The honor dates back to Sept. 24, 1874, when Richard T. Merrick, a prominent Washington, D.C. lawyer and the son of a former Philodemician, donated 18 shares of railroad stock to the university for the purchase of the Merrick Medal. Today, the Merrick Medal is the only non-academic award medal that can be worn during graduation.
A January all-society vote determined the theme for the debate, “Resolved: Certainty is a worthwhile pursuit.”
Judges included D.C. Councilman David Grosso (LAW ’01), theology professor Fr. Stephen Fields, S.J., Assistant Secretary at the United States Department of Labor T. Michael Kerr and former Vice President of the National Organization for Women Erin Matson (COL ’02).
“We reach out to people both at Georgetown and in the greater D.C. community who are accomplished,” Philodemic Vice President Anna Hernick (SFS ’16) said. “We try to get ideological diversity and people who bring unique experiences, especially in the realms of philosophy, politics, the things we love to talk about. That’s really fun because we get to bring a lot of interesting people to Georgetown.”
The judges are not announced until the day of the debate, and deliberations are also kept secret. In order to win, a student must exemplify the Philodemic Society’s motto of “eloquence in the defense of liberty.” Wynter delivered her keynote against contenders Jacob Arber (SFS ’14), Peter Prindiville (SFS ’14) and Patrick Spagnuolo (SFS ’14) and said that she respects them as speakers and friends.
“It’s always a hard decision, because everyone’s an amazing speaker,” Wynter said. “It was funny because I had kind of resigned myself to ‘these are three of my best friends not only in the Philodemic but at Georgetown,’ and it was kind of like anyone’s game.”
No alumni can remember a female winner in the recent past, since at least 2000. This summer, Philodemic President Chris DiMisa (COL ’15) plans to go through the archives in Lauinger Library’s Special Collections, as they are currently closed for renovations.
Nonetheless, Wynter’s success reflects changes that have been taking place over the past few years in the society, which is often stereotyped as an old boys’ club. Emma Green (COL ’12) was the last woman to speak at Merrick in 2012, but otherwise men have dominated the event. According to Wynter, this gender gap has been closing within the society.
“Other than that it’s always white males — nothing wrong with that of course — but I think the Philodemic has a bad rep as being an old boys’ club,” Wynter said. “Since our freshman year, [the other senior females and I] have really seen it grow as a place that women feel comfortable, as a place where all kinds of minorities feel comfortable.”
Hernick agreed that the Philodemic Society has changed and no longer reflects its stereotype.
“It’s probably the most inclusive group of people I’ve encountered at Georgetown, just in terms of any aspect you could think of from gender to political beliefs to religious beliefs,” Hernick said. “There’s really been a focus … of welcoming in different perspectives and different people. [The old boys’ club stereotype] is almost not even a consideration anymore. It’s more just something people reference as being from the past.”
Grace credits Wynter and the other females in her class for this shift.
“There were a lot of fantastic women in [Wynter’s] group and two years above her that really said, ‘If you truly want to be the forum for debate on a campus, you can’t only have certain voices speaking,’” Grace said.
Wynter said this trend started with the women in the classes above her, especially Allison Wagner (SFS ’11), who was president in 2010.
DiMisa said that he is more excited about what Wynter’s victory says about her speaking ability, although he is proud of the direction in which the society is heading.
“I think that really, at the end of the day, the question for me is who is the best speaker?” DiMisa said. “Seeing Amanda win was fantastic, as not only the first woman but the fact that she gave one of the best speeches I’ve heard. … I’m very proud of the society and very happy with where we are and looking forward to the future, but I think Amanda is absolutely one of the best Philodemicians we’ve had.”
Wynter said that she hopes that her legacy helps to open Philodemic to anyone who wants to be a part of it.
“I know that the popular conception when people hear Philodemic is either stuffy old people or just a bunch of men, but the beautiful thing is that it has become a place for all people to thrive, all people who look completely different,” she said. “I think it was awesome to win Merrick and I’m still really excited about it, but I think the more important thing is that it adds another level of accessibility to say that this too is not an impossibility.”

Couldn’t have happened to – or, rather, couldn’t have been accomplished by – a better person.  Amanda is everything you want in a Hoya and a person.

The Senate Subcommittee on Financial and Contracting Oversight distributed an extensive sexual assault survey Tuesday to over 350 public and private colleges and universities, including Georgetown, as a way to collect information about how institutions across the country respond to sexual assault cases on campus.
Subcommittee Chairman Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) was inspired to create and send out the survey from her visits to colleges in her home state. During these visits, the senator met with several university officials to discuss federal policy concerning sexual assault.
“This survey will give us an unprecedented look into exactly how our colleges and universities act — or sometimes, fail to act — to protect students and bring perpetrators to justice,” McCaskill said in a press release. “We need to ensure we have a firm grasp on the policies in place, and the reality on the ground, to inform any specific solutions. This survey is an important part of that effort.”
The Office of the President at Georgetown received the survey and forwarded it to relevant administrators for their input, including Title IX Coordinator Rosemary Kilkenny.
“I think Senator McCaskill has taken a particular interest in this area. She just wants to see justice being done and I think it is very good that Congress is taking an interest in this,” Kilkenny said. “It’s important that this issue is being addressed on the national level.”
Kilkenny has reviewed the questions in the survey and plans to meet with other administrators within the week to complete it.
“The survey makes you take another look and do a serious examination to see what can be done differently … [to see] how we could best address certain issues,” Kilkenny said.
The results of the survey will be aggregated and analyzed by McCaskill’s office to determine the future of federal action on sexual assault policy.
“The survey will probably show a hodgepodge of different practices schools are doing, a wide variation in knowledge and attitudes about sexual assault,” Sexual Assault Peer Educator Chandini Jha (COL ’16) said. “This reflects a larger confusion — willful or not — that universities have about their precise legal obligations under federal policy like Title IX.”
Sexual Assault and Relationship Violence Services Coordinator Jen Schweer said that she hopes the survey would give a stronger voice to those who have experienced sexual assault.
“It’s critical that many voices are called upon to be at the table; this includes survivors and those who work with them on a day-to-day basis. These are perspectives that are crucial in informing survivor-centered policy and legislation,” Schweer wrote in an email. “My hope is that Senator McCaskill’s efforts will reflect the many people and areas already deeply involved in this work.”
The survey questions will determine whether the institution is in compliance with Title IX and Clery Act requirements, which dictate the procedure for reporting a sexual assault and provide other information pertaining to sexual assault policy.
One question on the survey asked colleges to name the spaces on campus that can provide students with information on how to file a complaint with Title IX and if the admissions office could serve as a such a space.
“That is an example of a question that we can consider. Should we put information in admissions if that is where some students reach out to for guidance?” Kilkenny said.
Under Georgetown’s current protocol, students can report sexual misconduct to confidential resources in the offices of both Health Education Services and Counseling and Psychiatric Services, the Title IX office headed by Kilkenny and the Georgetown University Police Department. A newly revised policy requires all university employees, except for specially designated confidential counselors, to report a sexual assault to the Title IX office within 24 hours after the report has been made.
Last summer, several administrators revised the Georgetown sexual assault policy, which was approved by the board of directors. The changes included creating a new policy on sexual misconduct, revising the grievance procedure and ensuring an emphasis on confidentiality.
Students expressed support for the changes that the administration has made over the last year.
“As I scrolled through the survey, I was both pleasantly surprised by the many questions I know we are now able to answer with a confirmation — questions that just one year ago we would not have been able to,” Sexual Assault Working Group member and SAPE Mabel Rodriguez (COL ’14) wrote in an email. “The addition of a mandatory sexual assault training to NSO, an explicit alcohol amnesty clause, access to information on a website — all of these have been important steps for Georgetown this year.”
Rodriguez added that the survey offered a chance to remind the university of existent problems with its sexual assault policy.
“We need to be holding our universities accountable, especially if they are going to choose to adjudicate these crimes. We all need reminders of the options we are not considering,” Rodriguez wrote.
Jha agreed that Georgetown’s current sexual assault policy still has problems, notably the lack of transparency surrounding it.
“I think the current disciplinary process can be very difficult for survivors. There is a lack of clarity on what topics are admissible for the board, though there are customary practices the hearing board uses when dealing with these issues,” Jha said. “The fact that its practices are not well publicized to the student body imposes significant barriers on survivors coming forward.”
This past year has seen increased government involvement in raising awareness about sexual assault on college campuses through efforts beyond McCaskill’s survey. In January, President Obama established the “White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault,” and the White House issued a report revealing the high sexual assault rates on college campuses.
White House officials visited Gallaudet University on Thursday as part of their nationwide university tour in honor of the 20th anniversary of Bill Clinton’s Violence Against Women Act and the Department of Justice’s Office of Violence Against Women. The event featured remarks from Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole, who emphasized the importance of a coordinated response from both the federal government and from university administrators.
“While we believe that the federal government has an important role to play, we also know that the government alone cannot stop violence on campus,” Cole said. “It is essential to develop campus-based coordinated responses that include campus victim services, campus law enforcement, health providers, housing officials, administrators, student leaders, faith-based organizations, student organizations and disciplinary boards.”

Daniel Ellsberg, the former United States military analyst who famously released the Pentagon Papers to national newspapers, spoke about mass government surveillance in the modern world in Gaston Hall on Tuesday evening. The event, called “Beyond Orwell: Surveillance, Secrets and Whistleblowers in the Security State,” was sponsored by the Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Practice.
The evening opened with a videotaped address by Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, who broke the Edward Snowden story. Ellsberg then delivered the keynote address, followed by a panel discussion.
Author and film producer Anthony Arnove, who co-produced the acclaimed documentary “Dirty Wars” last year, moderated the panel, which included former National Security Agency executive Thomas Drake, former National Intelligence Estimates Chair Ray McGovern, former Ethics Advisor to the U.S. Department of Justice and Snowden’s attorney Jesselyn Radack and former FBI agent Coleen Rowley. The panelists all shared the view that the current U.S. government has perpetrated constitutional violations.
Ellsberg released the Pentagon Papers in 1971, revealing misperceptions of U.S. intentions during the Vietnam War and hastening its end. In his address, Ellsberg stressed the importance of a republican government in which information is public.
“Benjamin Franklin was asked at the end of the constitutional meetings, ‘What kind of government is it?’ and he said, ‘A republic, if you can keep it,’” Ellsberg said. “Have we kept it? No, we have not. Could we get it back? I would say not without people who are willing to take the risks.”
In order to make a change and preserve the republic, Ellsberg said it is important for citizens to listen to their consciences and take action in the face of injustice.
“Most officials, who were my colleagues at that point and people in Congress, never do find a degree of wrongdoing or injustice that will lead them to cross the line of exposing it or resisting it or putting themselves on the line,” Ellsberg said. “I asked [Snowden] what message he thinks I should give and he said, ‘If you believe in something, stand up for it.’”
Drake, a whistleblower who was indicted under the Espionage Act but exonerated of 10 felonies, argued that although citizens may not have anything to hide from the government, their privacy should be of the utmost importance.
“As sovereign human beings, we have a right to privacy and our own individuality,” Drake said. “What you do have to fear is that they can find out anything they want about you.”
Ellsberg said that professions that involve protecting confidentiality, such as journalism, could be drastically affected by increased government surveillance.
“If one branch of government has full knowledge of the private conversations, of the private lives … can it be that journalists can offer confidentiality to a source with any confidence?” Ellsberg said. “I would say no, that’s gone at this point.”
Ellsberg also expressed his appreciation and respect for citizens who fight to protect civil liberties. He said that he applauds whistleblowers for their courage and actions.
“I go out of my way to meet whistleblowers when they’re exposed or they’re prosecuted because I do feel that we’ve come from the same trajectory as insiders and have a similar experience and I respect what they’ve done,” Ellsberg said. “I want to thank them and I want to let them know that I congratulate them for what they’ve done and will help them as much as I can in the pressures that are brought to bear on them.”
Greenwald also acknowledged the similarities in the public reactions to the work of whistleblowers like Ellsberg, and more recently, Snowden and Chelsea Manning.
“Essentially, everything that is said now about Edward Snowden and other whistleblowers was said, virtually down to the letter of the script, about Daniel Ellsberg 40 years ago,” Greenwald said. “History has vindicated Daniel Ellsberg in such a way that almost nobody is willing to stand up in public any longer and contest the fact that what he did was noble and heroic.”
Channing Ruff (COL ’16) attended the event and said that the discourse gave him hope for the future of the United States.
“I thought that the speakers were very compelling,” he said. “Though their assessments were quite grim, I believe that there was a glimmer of hope, by having conversations such as this our generation can act to ensure that our nation doesn’t trample on our civil liberties in the name of national security.”

In the face of the shrinking job market for recent law school graduates, the Georgetown University Law Center remains confident in its ability to connect its students to jobs in the industry.
A recent data release by the American Bar Association showed that only 57 percent of law school graduates in 2013 found long-term, full-time jobs nine months after graduation, a mere 0.8 percent increase over 2012. The percentage of unemployed students seeking work rose from 10.6 percent in 2012 to 11.2 percent in 2013.
Despite the increased unemployment rates for law school graduates, employment statistics for Georgetown law school graduates are significantly above the national trend and have rebounded nicely from 2011, the worst year for law graduates. For the class of 2013, 93 percent were employed within nine months of graduation. Additionally, as of 2013, 83.7 percent of Georgetown law graduates are in bar-required, long-term full-time positions, a 21.1 percent increase from 2011 and a 10.4 percent increase from 2012, according to Assistant Dean of Career Services at the Law Center Marcia Shannon.
“Though the general legal market has been sluggish at best, Georgetown Law has shown a substantial increase in job prospects since 2011,” she said.
Shannon credited the Law Center’s rising graduate employment rate to the proactivity of students, along with increased resources to the Office of Career Services and Office of Public Interest and Community Service, as primary reasons for Georgetown’s relative success.
This decrease in job prospects for graduates nationally could also be attributed to the high number of law school graduates searching for employment. The graduating class of 2013, according to the American Bar Association, consisted of 46,776 students, a record number. Although the number is expected to fall, Shannon does not expect the national job market to flourish again soon.
“I suspect there will not be tremendous change in the overall employment statistics for law school graduates generally,” she said. “At Georgetown Law, we expect, given the quality of our students and the many new initiatives coming from the Law Center, our graduates will continue to have good prospects.”
Benjamin Lee (LAW ’14) noticed an improvement in the private job market during his personal search.
“I was always focused on private practice. It wasn’t great back in 2012, but things seem to be improving on the private market side,” Lee said. “I also found that the market for internships with the federal government was fairly strong for Georgetown students.”
Lee successfully landed a job with Clifford Chance, an international law firm based in New York.
Other law students acknowledged that the job market in its current state is stingy.
“The job market is tough. No one should think that getting a great job in this economy is easy, even nearly six years after the start of the financial crisis,” Grant Dubler (LAW ’14) said.
Those interested in public service and law appeared to be particularly affected by limited prospects.
“The public interest job market is tough. There is a huge shortage of legal services for low-income people, but organizations that offer these services often do not have the funding to hire a number of lawyers to meet the community need,” Allison Federoff (LAW ’14) said.
To navigate the tricky job market, Dubler emphasized the importance of flexibility.
“I wouldn’t say that it’s getting harder for law school graduates to find a job. It just might be getting harder for law school graduates to find a job at a large law firm,” Dubler said. “Phenomenal Georgetown Law graduates will always be able to write their own ticket anywhere, but there is no doubt that the old model of heading to an Am Law 100 firm to get a six-figure salary is an option only for about a third of law graduates, even at the best schools. However, there are plenty of great options outside of the corporate law world.”
Dubler will work as a Legislative Assistant for Congresswoman Lois Frankel (D-Fla.) next year.
Federoff, who will work as a staff attorney at Washington, D.C.’s Children Law Center, credits her success to the support she received from Georgetown.
“I feel so fortunate to have attended a law school that has an entire office dedicated to career counseling for public interest careers,” she said. “Georgetown Law has many programs to make it easier to pursue a career in public interest, such as providing full loan repayment assistance to those who work in public interest for at least 10 years.”
In addition to praise from its students, the law school also recently received official acclamation. The National Law Journal named the Law Center as one of the top schools in terms of overall job prospects, jobs with large law firms, as well as jobs in government and public interest in 2013.

The university celebrated the centenary anniversary of the birth of Jan Karski, a late Georgetown professor and a member of the Polish World War II resistance, on Thursday afternoon with a panel discussion, “Responsibility to Protect,” and a staged reading, “Remember This: Walking with Karski.”
In 1942 and 1943, Karski alerted the Polish, British and American governments about the circumstances in German-occupied Poland, including the presence of concentration camps and the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto. Karski later taught Eastern European affairs and international affairs in the School of Foreign Service for 40 years.
Director of the Master of Science in Foreign Service Anthony Arend (SFS ’80), Security Studies Program Director of Teaching Robert Egnell and Ambassador Melanne Verveer, the director of the Institute for Women, Peace and Security, spoke on the panel in Lohrfink Auditorium about Karski’s work and the “responsibility to protect” in cases of crimes against humanity. School of Foreign Service Acting Dean James Reardon-Anderson introduced the panel, and said that Karski’s work set the foundation for the modern conception of foreign relations.
“In many ways, Jan Karski was the pioneer of the principal that is now so much tested in international affairs. We framed this panel and decided to bring Karski up to the 21st century and look at the implications of his work today,” Anderson said.
In his address, Egnell spoke about the meaning of Karski’s concept of the responsibility to protect and its place in the political sphere.
“The responsibility to protect is a new norm that seeks to address the international community’s failure to prevent genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. … These ideas aren’t going anywhere,” Egnell said. “However, in order to understand the promises and limitations of the responsibility to protect, we really need to place it in a political context.”
Egnell also pointed out the contradictions present within the concept of the responsibility to protect.
“We simply cannot protect individual sovereignty and human rights without at the same time honoring the principle of state sovereignty, and that is a contradiction we live with and is at the heart of responsibility to protect concepts as well,” Egnell said.
Despite its flaws, though, Egnell said that the idea represents a shift in modern international affairs.
“While it might be seen as dysfunctional, it’s just a reflection of international politics and the different agenda that really define international states and peoples in the modern age,” Egnell said. “It represents ambition and normative direction in world affairs. And that is a much longer trend away from absolute interpretations and state sovereignty and towards respect to human rights and sovereignty as a responsibility.”
Verveer said that the idea of the responsibility to protect has evolved over the years, transforming towards humanitarianism.
“The words ‘the right to intervene’ slowly morphed into the responsibility to protect,” Verveer said. “It turned that issue of intervention for humanitarian purpose into responsibility to protect human lives, a responsibility of the international community to do so.”
Verveer also spoke about sexual violence against women and its implications in war and genocide.
“The obligation to protect is definitely an obligation to protect women against sexual violence, and the obligation to prevent and the obligation to rebuild certainly cannot succeed without understanding the role that women have to play in conflict resolution, in reconstruction, in peace negotiations,” she said.
Additionally, Arend spoke about the benefits, setbacks and challenges to the responsibility to protect. To Arend, the primary benefit of the concept is that it helped alter the definition of sovereignty to hold states accountable for its internal affairs.
“Sovereignty doesn’t mean you can do whatever you want because you’re a state. Rather, it means to be a state, you have the responsibility to protect people in your state, not just nationals, but aliens, refugees, anyone who happens to be in your state,” Arend said. “If they’re in your state, you have to protect them from crimes against humanity, from genocide, from other forms of mass atrocities.”
In order to increase the effectiveness of the responsibility to protect, Arend said that states must alter their conceptions of it and extend it to regional organizations. States do not have the legal right to intervene, since the United Nations Charter of 2009 does not create any new international law, but Arend said that there are ways around this problem.
“What I’m suggesting is that important states in the international system need to work with regional organizations to come up with new norms when intervention can take place to end these mass atrocities,” Arend said.
Sinéad Carolan (SFS ’17) attended the event and said that it helped her better understand crimes against humanity and the effect of the Holocaust.
“I came because I learned about Jan Karski and the fact that he was a professor at Georgetown in my Eastern European history class last semester, and I’m really interested in Europe and the Holocaust, as well as learning about the way we look at the Holocaust in history and how that applies to current events,” Carolan said.
Kiki Shim (SFS ’17) said that the panel gave her a better idea of threats to human rights in war.
“I think I’ve always been oddly, morbidly fascinated with the Holocaust and what its implications are in terms of morality,” Shim said. “This panel was very illuminating in terms of telling us more about different policies, especially the right to protect, because I’m interested in global human rights.”
“Remember This: Walking with Karksi,” directed by Davis Performing Arts Center Artistic Director Derek Goldman, had its world premiere at Gaston Hall. Academy Award nominee David Strathairn featured as the titular figure in the reading, which chronicle Karski’s life.

M Street will see the opening of new bike lanes from 14th Street NW to 29th Street NW within the next two weeks.
Sam Zimbabwe, the associate director for policy, planning and sustainability for the District Department of Transportation, said that the construction of the bike lanes was inspired by a need to protect bicyclists, pedestrians and vehicles on the busy street.
“The M Street cycletrack will provide a safe, protected facility for bicyclists on a busy downtown street where there currently aren’t facilities,” Zimbabwe wrote in an email.
According to a study conducted in 2010 by the DDOT exploring ways to improve downtown bike facilities, L Street and M Street would be ideal locations for improved facilities, namely bike lanes, due to the high bicycle traffic.
Acting upon this recommendation, the DDOT installed bike facilities in late 2012 on L Street, which provided an eastbound connection transecting downtown. The M Street cycletrack will serve as its counterpart going westbound.
“The L Street cycletrack has seen a big increase in bike traffic since installation, and our review of safety and usability has found that there has generally been an improvement since the installation,” Zimbabwe wrote.
Construction on the new M Street bike lanes began in December 2013, but the high volume of snow this winter delayed construction until early April. The bike lanes will be completed within the next week or two, depending on the weather.
“The installation at this point consists of finishing the pavement markings, installing new signs and installing flexposts to create the barrier for the bike lane, and adding green paint at intersections,” Zimbabwe wrote.
Bill Starrels, the vice chair of Georgetown’s Advisory Neighborhood Commission and the commissioner for the region including the expansion, noted that, based on previous experience, the construction of these bike lanes could result in an increase in congestion problems.
L Street has been horrendous with traffic,” Starrels said. “The street is just tough right now, especially making left turns.”
While he recognized this possibility for an increase in traffic, Zimbabwe pointed out the potential positive effects the bike lanes could have on sidewalk traffic.
“To create the cycletrack, we are reducing the capacity of the street for cars, but in our analysis, the impact will not be severe,” Zimbabwe wrote. “So, depending on who you are, the cycletrack could both help and hinder traffic for all modes.”
Zimbabwe added that the bike lanes will pull cyclists off the sidewalk, where they put pedestrians in danger.
“The lack of facilities mean that some brave cyclists use the road, while others illegally use the sidewalks,” Zimbabwe said. “The installation of the cycletrack will provide a protected facility in the street, which we think will not only attract more cyclists, it will actually attract them from other streets, like K, and get them off the sidewalks, where they are a hazard to pedestrians.”
At approximately $250,000, the cost of installing the bike lines will be paid for through local funds from the Capital Improvement Program, a six-year plan for the improvement of the District’s infrastructure and facilities.
“We just want to make sure it’s done in a safe and orderly way,” Starrels said.
Stephen Yin (SFS ’17) expressed enthusiasm for the changes in order to reduce congestion and improve travel in the Washington, D.C., area.
“[The bike lanes] would make my commute time a lot shorter because I usually have to walk my bike because of the risk of getting hit by a car,” he said. “The current absence of biking lanes makes it very hard and sometimes even dangerous for bikers like me to get where I need to go.”
Eugene Kim (SFS ’17), however, said that he felt the bike lanes would be a negative addition to M Street since the street space is already limited.
“It’s just not that necessary. However, that is coming from a young kid who doesn’t mind taking risks at times. I can see how other cyclists, especially those who approach it as a serious sport, would desire to have a separate lane for safety concerns and simple convenience,” he said.

In March, University Information Services implemented a pilot printing program on the second floor of Lauinger Library that allows students to print documents from their phones for free. The pilot, if successful, will be executed at all print stations on campus to augment the printing environment on campus by making it more mobile-friendly.
According to Jennifer Smith, coordinator of communications, outreach and programming at the library, UIS chose the location because of the popularity of the second floor as a printing location.
“The library supports the university’s efforts to find an affordable, convenient [and] sustainable solution for printing, including mobile printing,” Smith wrote in an email. “The current initiative offering free printing on the second floor of Lauinger is a temporary pilot program by UIS and Xerox to test the mobile printing technology. They chose Lauinger as the site given the high volume of printing done here.”
In order to utilize the system, students must download the Xerox Print Portal app, which allows any mobile user to send documents wirelessly for printing. UIS Mobile Program Manager Lee Emmert said that feedback from the pilot program will help UIS implement it across campus by the fall.
“Mobile print is part of our larger deployment of a modernized print program at Georgetown, something that we’re working on this summer,” Emmert said. “The goal behind the mobile print pilot in Lauinger is to collect student feedback about the mobile print environment to see what students think, to identify areas where we could make improvements and ultimately to ensure that what we deployed this summer for next fall is a solution that students really want and they can use.”
The partnership with Xerox stems from a desire to increase print efficiency and quality, according to Emmert.
“Partnering with Xerox is something that we’re doing, not just for student print, but also for faculty and staff print,” Emmert said. “The goal there is to modernize the print environment at Georgetown for all and to bring more efficiency to our print environment.”
Emmert said that students have sent UIS positive and constructive feedback.
“We’ve received a lot of feedback, and generally, almost overwhelmingly, positive feedback,” Emmert said. “An email that comes to mind is from one student who is a senior in the College, and he wrote that he wished that this mobile print solution was available four years ago when he first started at Georgetown, because he would have used it all the time.”
While the trial is free and covered by UIS, once implemented campus wide in the fall, the service will charge fees directly to the student’s phone through the app. Rates will remain at 10 cents per page.
Christina Ling (MSB ’15) works in the McDonough School of Business Technology Center and said that she plans to use the system in the future.
“I think it’s a great idea, especially because nowadays, I think around 65 percent of people use smartphones. I personally use my iPhone more than I use my laptop, and being able to integrate mobile devices would be really useful and convenient for much of the student body,” she said.
According to Ling, the new system may pose problems for students working in the technology center, since changing operating systems could make installation difficult.
“If the mobile print system were to be implemented in the business school, I actually think it may make work for the employees at the tech center more burdensome because we’d also have to help install this printing system onto smartphones on top of installing the software onto laptops,” Ling said. “Technology is very fast-paced and changing with new developments and operating systems, there may not necessarily be a quick fix to make sure that the software works with each new technological development.”
Despite this, Emmert said that he hopes that the implementation of mobile printing, as well as the addition of more print stations, will make Georgetown a more mobile-friendly, efficient campus.
“We’re hoping to provide more convenient print options for students, to make it easier to print and to make it more widely available,” Emmert said. “As far as the larger student print project, we’re looking to bring print into spaces where students want to be able to print. We are actually upgrading all of the printers in the existing lab spaces on the main campus to new printers, and we’re also talking about adding some new spaces.”

Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) has reintroduced the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act, which would require all colleges and universities that receive federal funds to explicitly recognize cyber-bullying as harassment as well as establish anti-harassment policies.
The new legislation would require Georgetown to define cyberbullying in its Code of Student Conduct. The university already has an anti-harassment policy in place listed under the violations of the code, which defines harassment as “any intentional or persistent act(s) deemed intimidating, hostile, coercive or offensive.”
The bill, named for the Rutgers freshman who jumped off the George Washington Bridge as a result of personally invasive cyberbullying in fall 2010, is co-sponsored by several other senators, including Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Al Franken (D-Minn.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).
Co-Director of the Student Advocacy Office Ryan Shymansky (COL ’16) said he believes that the policy as it is already functions effectively to serve Georgetown students.
“[The conduct code is] actually very broad, in that it covers coercive actions, intimidating actions, hostile actions,” Shymansky said. “So it’s kind of a catch-all thing for what student conduct needs it to be. It would be nice to have a formal definition that was perhaps more specific and spelled out things better. But on the flip side of that, I will say the positive takeaway is that the harassment policy is broad enough that Student Conduct is able to adjudicate what they need to.”
Shymansky emphasized the balance of the code, and the potential danger of attempting to add the cyberbullying portion to it.
“I don’t want to commit to saying that it [the general policy] is working because clearly, specifically, I’m going to say that cyberbullying isn’t addressed in the policy as clearly as it should be,” Shymansky said. “The con of that is you don’t want to limit the ability to effectively adjudicate harassment cases by perhaps limiting things too much.”
The new bill specifies harassment on the basis of “a student’s actual or perceived- race; color; national origin; sex; disability; sexual orientation; gender identity or religion.” Georgetown’s Code of Student Conduct addresses some of these factors under headings such as the “Ethos Statement” and “Respect for the Dignity of the Person,” but not under the harassment policy itself.
Beverly Magda, the associate dean of the master of professional studies in technology management, said that academic institutions have a responsibility toward their students in the absence of a federal law about cyberbullying.
“Because of the awareness of [cyberbullying], parents are becoming more involved, schools are becoming more involved,” Magda said. “So I think it’s starting to change but I always find that a lot of laws, historically, are reactive, and it takes a lot of time for laws to catch up to technology. We see it in the information security field also, it’s like something has to happen before a law is enacted or integrated.
Murray reintroduced the bill, which the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) had originally sponsored, as a result of learning that one of her interns in her Washington, D.C. office had undergone harassment because of his sexual orientation. However, SAO co-Director Ben Manzione (SFS ’15) said there were no reported cases of cyberbullying at Georgetown in the year he has already served as co-director.
“We don’t have too many cases regarding harassment, and we can really only speak to the scope of what we have,” Manzione said. “That said, there are measures in place, and the current policies do address some of these issues. However, we haven’t seen too many cases regarding harassment so we can’t say for sure.”
Some students feel that Georgetown’s policy should be expanded to include cyberbullying.
“I definitely think it should be a part of our code of conduct because now, more and more social interactions are going online, and I feel like cyberbullying is worse than bullying especially in regards to sexual assault because the interactions are happening online where other people can see and there are records of it,” Soraya Eid (MSB ’17) said. “Other people have access to it, so that can just worsen the situation for the victim.”
Manzione noted the deficiencies in other areas of the Code of Student Conduct, and how upcoming efforts to institute a hazing policy and expand other sections have taken priority.
“It’s just a matter of prioritizing certain things,” Manzione said. “And I think the recognition that we do have a harassment policy, harassment is adjudicated effectively, I think that’s a good sign. And as long as that’s working as it ought to, there are things that are going to get changed in the code first.”

Mark Tercek, president and CEO of The Nature Conservancy, led a conversation entitled “The Value of Nature” in the Intercultural Center Auditorium on Tuesday. The event was co-sponsored by the Georgetown Center for the Environment, Georgetown’s Office of Sustainability and the Green Alumni Network in commemoration of Earth Day.
Tercek took on his leadership position at The Nature Conservancy in 2008, after a 24-year career at Goldman Sachs. He uses this experience to lead The Nature Conservancy, a global conservation organization, as a big business complete with investments and marketing strategies.
Tercek’s talk focused on the main themes of his recently published book, “Nature’s Fortune: How Business and Society Thrive by Investing in Nature.”
Tercek described three strategies that he claimed to be useful for any big business — gaining more supporters, gaining more financial resources and forming new ways to amicably conduct business.
“We have to be smart about what needs to be done and smart about doing it,” Tercek said.
In terms of supporters, Tercek emphasized how important it is to educate citizens on environmental issues and to get them involved. He stated that universities act as “catalysts for important conversations,” pointing out Georgetown’s numerous sustainability initiatives.
He then explained how an abundance of financial resources is essential to increase awareness and to execute successful operations.
“Nature is an investment opportunity,” Tercek said.
Since The Nature Conservancy relies heavily on philanthropy and government grants, Tercek emphasized how important it is for other big organizations to invest, reframing environmental issues as capitalistic ventures and thinking about nature as “green” infrastructure.
However, Tercek cautioned that creating new business models that please everyone can be difficult.
“There is too much fighting, disagreement and partisanship,” Tercek said. “It gets in the way of progress.”
When it comes to the environment, especially, there will always be issues that need to be discussed, but Tercek warned that fighting about them only turns away supporters.
“Environmentalists need to be polite and rebuild central support for environmental matters,” Tercek said.
Throughout his discussion, Tercek constantly stressed how urgent it is to have a “robust regulatory oversight,” such as a tax on carbon emissions, that will provide feedback on initiatives and minimize environmental harm.
Tercek also noted how The Nature Conservancy has formed new partnerships with many successful organizations that have large carbon footprints, such as Goldman Sachs.
“These new alliances will enable us to conserve nature at a scale never before achieved,” Tercek wrote in his book.
At the end of Tercek’s talk, a number of students, alumni and professors participated in a question-and-answer session.
Greg Miller (SFS ’14), a former sustainability research fellow, asked Tercek about the business case for Georgetown, as a billion dollar organization, to invest in sustainability through both its educational and operational practices.
Tercek replied by saying that Georgetown’s underlining business is education, so teaching students to become “science literate citizens” and emphasizing new innovations would produce the best environmental outcomes.
“Georgetown could hugely benefit from better adopting the business logic approach to sustainability into its day-to-day operations,” Miller said after Tuesday’s conversation.

In the wake of three suicides at its Mount Vernon campus earlier this year, The George Washington University has rushed to add counseling resources at its satellite campus. At Georgetown’s other Washington, D.C. locations, counseling services already present at the Law Center and the School of Continuing Studies ensured no mirrored response is necessary.
Three students in West Hall, a dormitory of George Washington’s satellite campus located in northwest D.C., have died since January — two in the first week of April. The first two have been confirmed as suicides, and the cause of death for the third is unconfirmed.
“We at [Counseling and Psychiatric Services], like many others on campus, were greatly saddened to learn of these tragedies and this premature loss of life. Our hearts go out to the students, families, friends and to faculty and staff at GWU,” Phil Meilman, Georgetown CAPS director, wrote in an email.
On April 5, GWU reacted to the events by offering counseling services to the Mount Vernon campus through the rest of the year, and the university is considering making those services public.
With all off-campus locations already holding psychiatric facilities, Georgetown administrators expressed confidence in the placement and availability of the university’s counseling services, though Meilman assured that CAPS remains vigilant about such incidents.
“On a regular basis, we work with other offices on campus to figure out the best ways to address behavioral incidents that are affecting the community,” Meilman said.
Located in Darnall Hall, the CAPS office aims to serve both undergraduate students and graduate students who take classes on the main campus.
There are satellite CAPS offices at the university’s other locations at SCS on Massachusetts Avenue and the Law Center near Capitol Hill, both staffed with professionals for all needs.
Mitchell Bailin, dean of students at the Law Center, explained that, while all Georgetown students have the opportunity to visit the main campus for counseling, he has found that the law students typically visit the law center’s CAPS office, which is staffed with two full-term clinical psychologists and a psychiatrist.
“They have a choice, and most of them choose, if they’re going to seek an evaluation, to seek it here on campus because it’s more convenient,” Bailin said.
Meilman stressed the importance of these satellite offices in order to properly meet the needs of graduate students at the Law Center and SCS.
“For the most part, graduate students are older, have already chosen a field, more are partnered or married and some have children, so the issues tend [to] be somewhat different from those of undergraduates,” Meilman said.
Bailin saw the service as essential for law students because of the stress associated with their future profession.
“Many, many students every year go for at least one evaluative session, and sometimes more than one session, with one of the clinical psychologists,” he said. “Our students talk very openly about the need for self-care and for being attentive to their wellness as something that they need to do to prepare for a stressful profession.”
The SCS has similar resources in place for its students with staff members of CAPS available onsite at the downtown campus.
“Both CAPS staff members have offices at the SCS downtown campus,” Maggie Moore, ommunications officer of arts and sciences for Georgetown University, wrote in an email. “SCS students may call the intake line and are then referred to emergency services or may make an appointment to meet one of these counselors on the SCS downtown campus.”
The SCS also takes particular care to ensure the services are available at times that are convenient to students.
“Because many SCS students have classes there at night, one of the staff members there begins her workday at 4 p.m.,” Meilman said.
Bailin did not see any particular response to the GWU incidents, but considered the existing system attuned to the students’ needs and well-received by the student body.
“We ramped up our services four years ago now. We used to have the equivalent of one full-time clinical psychologist and we went to two, and that was consistent with increasing demand of law schools across the country for mental health care for law students,” he said. “I think we long ago saw the need to increase our resources and we successfully did that and it served the law students very well.”

Fr. John O’Malley, S.J., and Gerard Mannion, the amaturo professor in Catholic Studies, discussed the upcoming canonization of Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II, and the former popes’ impact on the Catholic Church in Riggs Library on Wednesday. Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., moderated the event, titled “Continuity and Change in the Modern Papacy.”
Although popes are commonly canonized, or declared as saints by the Catholic Church, O’Malley characterized this trend as detrimental for the church. Mannion agreed, saying that canonization has become a habit that the church must break.
“It’s harder to fall out of that habit than it is to fall into it. It’s a little bit like on a university campus when you start naming buildings after previous administrators. The habit gets established and it goes on and on and then it becomes expected,” Mannion said. “One has to ask what is the real purpose behind canonization, and what is it saying about the church’s process of sainthood, of having models of heroic virtue.”
Both speakers noted that Pope John XXIII will be remembered for his convening of the Second Vatican Council, which examined relations between the church and the modern world and renewed Catholic doctrines in accordance with a modern perspective.
“This was a big event in the history of the Catholic Church and world history,” O’Malley said, “No doubt about it that John XXIII’s convoking of the council was a landmark, for better or for worse, however you want to look at it, it was absolutely a landmark for the Catholic Church.”
This council’s influence helps to explain the direction that the church has taken under Pope Francis, according to O’Malley.
“Whereas I really feel that with Paul VI, and John Paul II and Benedict XVI, they were still fighting the battles of the council. They were still too involved in the council,” O’Malley said. “Francis is not, it’s a given. These great movements of the council, he just takes it as the air he breathes.”
A strong sense of interfaith dialogue also ran as a common thread through the tenures of the two popes. John XXIII’s history made dialogue especially meaningful for him during his time in the military.
“Both of them were passionate about the importance of interfaith dialogue,” Mannion said.”[John XXIII] was posted to Turkey, Eastern Europe. He spent time there. He had to live dialogue. During the Second World War he was the go-between for the many sides in Istanbul.”
A sense of openness and an embracing of the world in its reality was also an important aspect of John XXIII’s pontificate, according to O’Malley.
“What he learned by experience was the goodness of people across confessional divides, and across religious faith divides and an optimism and a willingness and to take reality as it is and cooperate with it instead of the alienation of the church from the modern world that had taken place in the 19th century,” O’Malley said.
An attendee, Michelle Dailey (COL ’14), appreciated the timing of the discussion.
“I thought it was really cool that Georgetown decided to do this event in light of the canonization because I think it is really an important moment. And so I think it was really interesting that we got some of our biggest and brightest names out here,” Dailey said.
Dailey said that she sees the trend of increasing pope canonization as inspirational rather than troubling as it attests to each of our abilities to succeed spiritually.
“At the same time, part of me thinks it’s almost maybe a good thing in the sense that it does remind people that, for example, people can be good and holy people even if they aren’t perfect, whereas I think that when you submitted less people to the sainthood that set the expectation really high,” Dailey said.
Georgetown will host a musical celebration of the canonization of the two popes next week with a concert at DAR Constitution Hall in conjunction with Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the Washington Archdiocese and the Embassies of Italy, Argentina and Poland.

Last summer, administrators ran into an unexpected roadblock after releasing designs for the Northeast Triangle Residence Hall: impassioned alumni and student objection to the dorm’s appearance. This objection eventually led to the delay of the new residence hall from fall 2015 to fall 2016 and a search for a new look that could be accepted by the Georgetown community.
When students returned to campus in the fall, housing continued to dominate university announcements and news throughout the year. In some cases, similarly strong reactions again stopped university projects, including a proposed satellite residence and changes to the housing process for current sophomores.
As the year winds down, construction is set to begin on the Northeast Triangle pending another round of approval by the Old Georgetown Board, and a third-year housing requirement for all students is now official. Housing will likely continue to play an important role in student-administrator interactions as some of the headlines that garnered student attention this year take shape on campus.
 
Plans for the Northeast Triangle met their first obstacle at the OGB’s June meeting. The board rejected the university’s original proposal — a seven-story building that would house 250 students — and suggested that administrators present alternative housing options as well as adapt the design for the Northeast Triangle in accordance with student and alumni opinions. Prior to the June meeting, OGB members received approximately 20 emails from students expressing their distaste for the new residence.
In response to student and alumni criticism of the building’s design and location on one of the only remaining green spaces on the north side of campus, administrators and architects from Sasaki Architect Company held a series of forums throughout the summer and fall semester. Additionally, administrators met with certain “target” student groups, such as Residence Hall Office managers, resident assistants and the InterHall Council, to garner more feedback.
“Backing up and going through all of the student-engagement process really got to the crux of what it was to be a building on Georgetown and for Georgetown and what it meant to build within the context of not only the history, but the existing campus plan and also to build for the future,” Associate University Architect Jodi Ernst said.
After impassioned alumni and student distaste for the first Northeast Triangle Residence Hall design, far left, Sasaki Associates redesigned the dormitory to reach its current incarnation, far right. Changes from August to now aimed to better integrate the building with Georgetown’s existing architecture, both by the front gates and on the north side of campus.
 
In February, architects presented updated plans for the building that were based on student input and OGB’s suggestions. The eight-story building will include a variety of semi-suites consisting of two, four or six beds and a compartmentalized bathroom. Additionally, each residential floor will have a common room and a kitchen. With GOCard room access, the Northeast Triangle will be Georgetown’s first keyless residence hall.
The ground floor of the building will have a large, open engagement space, which will include a large workroom, a multipurpose room that can be divided into two smaller rooms and a kitchen.
The building’s exterior was designed to connect the stone buildings in the Dahlgren Quadrangle and Red Square with the brick buildings, like those in Henle Village and the Leavey Center, on the north side of campus. The residence hall will also feature a varied window pattern.
“The student input, once we pulled back and took a look at what we were doing, really turned the building from being sort of a materiality that wasn’t present at Georgetown into a building that more closely relates to what we have going on. It fits into our history and also looks forward,” Ernst said.
A green terrace with concrete seat edges will lead up to the building; administrators plan to install new benches as well as movable tables and chairs.
The Northeast Triangle received OGB concept approval in March. The university will go before the OGB again in June for design-development approval.
“What we have now is a building that is very thoughtfully designed, and we’re going to begin construction there later this summer,” Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said.
If the university receives OGB approval in June, it will begin site-utility relocation later that month. Construction of the Northeast Triangle is scheduled to commence in October, after the pre-existing water and electrical utilities are relocated from underneath the area where the residence will be built.
“We’re trying to make sure that there are no gaps, so that once we start, it’s sequenced in a way that is logical,” Ernst said.
 
With the Northeast Triangle set to be home to approximately 225 students, the university continued to search for additional housing options in order to comply with the 2010 Campus Plan agreement, which dictates that 385 students must be moved out of the Georgetown neighborhood’s 20007 zip code by fall 2015.
The university announced in September that a satellite undergraduate residence was under consideration, meeting immediate student opposition. In order to get students out of the immediate neighborhood, administrators considered locations such as Clarendon, Va., a site near Capitol Hill and an area north of campus on Wisconsin Avenue.
“We needed to explore all of our options at our disposal and we wanted to do our due diligence to make sure we were looking through all of the possibilities,” Olson said.
Administrators proposed busing students back and forth between the satellite residence and the main campus and dabbled in the idea of incentivizing the residence by ensuring that it was of a higher quality than on-campus dormitories.
Nevertheless, students quickly expressed their distaste for the plan. A few days after administrators announced that a satellite residence was under consideration, students launched the “One Georgetown, One Campus” campaign in order to voice opposition to the creation of any residence outside of the Georgetown neighborhood.
In addition to staging a demonstration near the front gates, the campaign’s supporters circulated a petition to bring the issue to a Georgetown University Student Association referendum in order to gauge student opinion and communicate with the administration.
“We kept the lines of communication open, and I think [the administration] really understood and respected that our passion was coming from a place of really caring about Georgetown,” former GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) said.
The petition received 412 signatures, exceeding the 300 signatures necessary to create a GUSA referendum.
At the end of September, 2,746 out of 2,966 students voted against the creation of a satellite residence. Just 7 percent of voters indicated that they were in favor of university housing outside of the Georgetown neighborhood.
“I think very quickly [the administration] saw that it wasn’t just one or two GUSA representatives who were upset about [the satellite residency],” Tisa said. “It very quickly became clear that a cross section of campus organizations were pretty miffed about it for various reasons.”
 
Influenced by the outcome of the referendum, administrators announced in November that a satellite residence was off the table. Instead, Ryan and Mulledy Halls, the former Jesuit residence in Dahlgren Quadrangle, will be converted into student housing to bring approximately 160 new beds to campus.
“We listened in a very serious way to student input and student views on this,” Olson said.
Although originally considered as a temporary solution to meeting the housing requirement, Ryan and Mulledy will be made into a long-term student residence.
“There were a lot of conversations among administrators and involving students as part of the process, as well, to just look creatively at all of the options on campus, and after careful review we determined that [Ryan and Mulledy] was a promising opportunity to pursue,” Olson said.
Once it is converted, the residence will consist of primarily suite-style rooms, which will include private bathrooms and living areas in addition to bedrooms. Because of the buildings’ structural constraints, there will also be a small number of semi-suites, like those in Copley Hall, which will not include private living areas. Architects from Ayers Saint Gross are working to maintain certain aspects of the buildings’ design, such as the large windows and the high ceilings.
Additionally, spaces such as the buildings’ chapel and the old Jesuit dining room, which will be made into a common gathering space, will be preserved because of their historical significance.
“We’ve worked hard to involve our Jesuit community in the planning because of the historic ties and nature of the building, and their perspectives have enriched the project,” Olson said.
The first stages of the construction process will commence next month, and the conversion is expected to be finished by fall 2015.
 
Along with construction and campus plan changes, the 2013-2014 academic year also saw revisions to the university’s housing policy for third-year students and those studying abroad.
On Jan. 16, the Office of Residential Living announced that beginning with the Class of 2016, students studying abroad in the fall semester would have to renounce both their eligibility and place in the housing lottery for the coming semester. Student response was swift, with a GUSA resolution challenging the policy and the subsequent creation of a Facebook page, “Students Against Restrictive Housing,” that garnered over 700 likes in two weeks. On Feb. 11, Residential Living announced that it intended to maintain the policy but that it would postpone its implementation until fall 2015.
Another policy change came from students, rather than the administration. In November, GUSA announced the creation of “What’s a Hoya?” to tie housing points for freshmen to attendance of seminars on issues such as diversity and sexual assault.
The past semester also brought policy changes to help meet the campus plan’s stipulation that the university house an additional 385 students on campus by fall 2015. Other measures taken throughout the year, like converting more Southwest Quad rooms into triples, also worked toward this goal.
In an email to the Georgetown community Wednesday, Olson announced that, beginning with the Class of 2017, students would be required to live in university housing for three years, with exceptions for transfer students and students who study abroad.
 
While plans for the conversion of the old Jesuit residence were underway, the advancement of the Northeast Triangle lagged. The new residence, which was originally scheduled to open in fall 2015, is now not expected to be complete until fall 2016 because of delays in the approvals process.
In order to meet the fall 2015 deadline, the university would have had to receive OGB concept approval when it initially went before the board last June.
“We would have had to go through the process in a more orderly fashion in June to get the approvals at the points in time that we needed the approvals in order to meet the fall 2015 deadline,” Ernst said. “The decision that was made was the right decision, and that was not to force a design through that didn’t have universal buy-in.”
By extending the design process to incorporate feedback from students, alumni and the OGB, administrators prolonged the approvals process. Despite the delay, administrators said that they do not doubt that they made the right decision.
“We wanted to move forward very enthusiastically on that project once we identified the site,” Olson said. “We know that there were some questions about the appearance of the building — how well it fits with the character of the campus — that we wanted to take seriously and so we think it was a very reasonable pause to make sure we were listening to all of the voices, taking student and alumni feedback seriously, taking seriously feedback from the Old Georgetown Board as they reviewed the project and making sure that the project made sense to all the key stakeholders.”
In light of this delay, administrators reconsidered converting the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center into student housing. The hotel had previously been reviewed as a potential housing option in 2012, but administrators ruled out the idea because of the revenue loss that would result from losing the hotel space.
Administrators announced in December that two of the hotel’s four floors would be converted to house 120 students for the 2015-2016 school year. By maintaining half of the hotel space, revenue loss will be minimized. Few details about the temporary conversion have been determined.
In order to add 385 beds to campus, administrators are also considering modifying existing space in residence halls such as LXR, Village C East and the Southwest Quad to include additional dorms.
“We’re looking at both hotel space and space in existing residence halls, and that’s a process we’re committed to following through on,” Olson said. “It’s earlier in that design process.”
While administrators must try to make the most of pre-existing spaces in order to comply with the campus plan because of delays with the Northeast Triangle, Olson said that the university was prepared to deal with such setbacks.
“In general, on our very compact urban campus, any new project like this is going to have a set of challenges that go with figuring out how to do this project in a way that meets our programmatic needs, that respects the historic nature of our campus and that takes the needs of all of the stakeholders involved seriously,” Olson said. “There’s not any capital project that we’ll do on this campus that is simple, and that’s without those issues to think through, so I think that the issues we faced were to be expected in our environment here.”

From online movements combatting microaggressions at universities nationwide to student-led rallies calling for reform at the gates of the White House, the past year has seen prolific Georgetown student activism.
 
Inspired by #BBUM, or Being Black at the University of Michigan, students created their own Twitter movements documenting minorities’ experiences at Georgetown, including #BBGU (Being Black at Georgetown University), #BAGU (Being Asian at Georgetown University), #BLGU (Being Latino/a at Georgetown University), #BDGU (Being Disabled at Georgetown University) and #DBKGU (Dangerous Black Kids of Georgetown University).
“There’s definitely a movement of students challenging their respective institutions to think critically about these issues, and I’m happy that I’m a part of it or could be a part of it, to see this happening, because I think it’s a very great way for our generation to speak to larger issues about race and class and diversity,” #BBGU organizer Aya Waller-Bey (COL ’14) said.
#BBGU, Georgetown’s first Twitter movement, launched in December 2013 to create a public and safe space for black students to voice their grievances and speak on behalf of their experiences as members of the Georgetown community, notably on the existence of microaggressions, or means of communication concealing offensive or discriminatory undertones. This movement inspired the subsequent rise of #BLGU and #BAGU, which also promoted awareness of racially charged microaggressions.
#DBKGU, a similar protest launched in February on Facebook and Tumblr, more closely followed the format of “I, Too, Am Harvard,” a photo campaign aiming to promote awareness of the prevalence of microaggressions as well as challenge racial stereotypes and show diversity within Harvard. Shavonnia Corbin-Johnson (SFS ’14), the founder of #DBKGU, organized the movement as a way to critique the negative images society often associates with the black community. The page has amassed more than 1,400 likes to date.
“I actually didn’t think it would get as large as it did,” Corbin-Johnson said.
According to Lydia Brown (COL ’15), one of the primary #BDGU organizers, #BDGU has yet to galvanize the support among Georgetown administrators that the movement would require to be successful.
“In our primary aim, I believe we had limited success. A number of prominent student leaders … knew about or participated in the conversation. There is still a long way to go. So far, no official statement from the administration has been forthcoming regarding plans for a Disability Cultural Center, nor have any of the major institutional barriers to access for students with disabilities been changed,” Brown wrote in an email.
 
Georgetown students’ protests, however, weren’t limited to the screen this year.
After university officials proposed the creation of a satellite residence to house undergraduate students Sept. 8, members of the Georgetown University Student Association launched the One Georgetown, One Campus campaign and gathered 400 petition signatures within three hours. In the subsequent referendum, the student body voted overwhelmingly against the university’s proposal, with just 7 percent of students saying they were in favor of the creation of a satellite campus.
Students also successfully challenged the administration to protest proposed changes to the housing process for current sophomores in February. After student pushback, policy implementation was delayed.
In October, representatives from GU Pride sat in on a Love Saxa event, protesting the Campus Ministry-affiliated organization, which aims to counter campus hookup culture, for its recent choice of allegedly homophobic speakers, including Mark Regnerus, who condemns same-sex parenting.
On-campus protest extended to employers within the front gates. The Georgetown Solidarity Committee, aided by the Georgetown chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Hoyas for Immigrant Rights and GUSA, organized a march in November on restaurant Epicurean and Co. to present its owner, Chang Wook Chon, with a petition demanding fair treatment of the restaurant’s workers. In response, Chon issued a statement in December restating his commitment to upholding Georgetown’s Just Employment Policy but said that he did not intend to change his business practices as a result of the petition.
“I have taken many steps to show my commitment to Epicurean employees, to Georgetown University and to the Just Employment Policy,” Chon wrote. “I will continue to work with the associate vice president of auxiliary services and the greater Georgetown University administration on the Just Employment Policy.”
Not all on-campus protests were successful. On January 20, members of H*yas for Choice were removed from Healy Circle by Georgetown University Police Department officers just 18 minutes after they had settled in to protest the Cardinal O’Connor Conference on Life outside of their usual Red Square setting.
 
Student activism also extended beyond the Hilltop, as Georgetown students joined with hundreds of universities around the country to protest the construction of the XL Keystone Pipeline on March 2.
The protesters marched to the White House and zip-tied themselves to the North Lawn fence, sprawling out on a mock plastic oil spill. Of the 10 Georgetown students who participated, three were arrested, including Caroline James (COL ’16), Chloe Lazarus (COL ’16) and Michelle Stearn (SFS ’15). Despite the march’s start on campus, the 10 Georgetown students were few in number among the 1,000 protesters.
Student immigration activists’ voices also rang loudly weeks later when, on April 5, more than 100 Georgetown students marched to the White House as part of a National Day of Action, shouting “Obama, escucha, estamos en lucha,” or “Obama, listen, we are fighting,” to protest the record number of deportations that have occurred under the Obama administration.
Hoyas for Immigrant Rights President Citlalli Alvarez (COL ’16) called the protest a success, praising it for bringing together Georgetown students and the outside community.
“That, for me, signified the success more than anything, the way in which we were able to support that community more,” Alvarez said.

After a rollercoaster campaign marred by the specter of a campaign finance scandal, D.C. Councilmember Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4) unseated incumbent Mayor Vincent Gray in the April 1 Democratic primary, preparing her to face Councilmember David Catania (I-At Large) in the Nov. 4 general election for mayor.
Former commissioner for Advisory Neighborhood Commission 4B and local political activist Bowser, 41, attracted voters as a turn from D.C.’s tradition of political corruption and separated herself from a crowded field of challengers that included fellow councilmembers Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6) and Vincent Orange (D-At Large), as well as restaurateur Andy Shallal and U.S. State Department official Reta Jo Lewis.
“People are responding to our message of a fresh start and the promise of a government you can actually be proud of,” Bowser said after a February debate.
Gray was repeatedly hounded by opponents and voters alike who demanded answers stemming from alleged wrongdoing that took place during his 2010 campaign for mayor, including the acceptance of over $600,000 in illegal campaign contributions from businessman Jeffrey Thompson.
Exuding confidence in mayoral forums and debates throughout January and February, Gray seemed content to let challengers fight among themselves, choosing instead to highlight his administration’s accomplishments in education and budgetary management.
“We’ve seen the unemployment rate drop to 8.9 percent, we have the most robust early childhood education program in the nation. This administration has made this city better over the last three-and-a-half years,” Gray said at a January mayoral forum.
Boosted by an aggressive ground campaign and an endorsement from The Washington Post, Bowser began to emerge in mid-February as the clear challenger to Gray.
While Gray maintained a slight lead heading into March, not even his team of D.C. political heavyweights could have anticipated the events of March 14, when U.S. Attorney Ron Machen announced that Thompson had implicated Gray in his guilty plea to conspiracy charges.
Meanwhile, Bowser continued to climb in the polls, pulling dead even in the weeks leading up to Election Day.
April 1 brought a historically low voter turnout of 27 percent, a number not seen since 1974. The day also brought a resounding victory for Bowser, who won 44 percent of the vote to Gray’s 33 percent and carried many precincts Gray had previously won in 2010. Interest in the election among Georgetown students, most of whom are not registered to vote in D.C., was lacking throughout this year. Students interviewed shortly before the primary showed marked disinterest in the race.
“It is hard to be a convincing voting bloc since most students are not registered to vote in D.C.,” Georgetown University Student Association Undersecretary for D.C. Relations Callie Hinerfeld (SFS ’17) said in March.
While the general mayoral election is normally a formality in the heavily Democratic District, Bowser now goes on to face a significant challenge from Catania in the November election.
Catania, a former Republican, would be the first openly gay mayor and first non-Democratic, white mayor to be elected since 1973.
While the general election will not heat up until late summer, the race promises to highlight education policy as well as inequalities across the wards.
“We’re going into the general election with the same strategy, knocking on every door, going across this city to make sure people know our message and know what we’re bringing to the table,” Bowser campaign manager Bo Shuff said.
The general election for mayor will be held along with national elections for the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives on Nov. 4.

Last year’s Year in Review highlighted the progression of LGBTQ student groups on campus, as well as LGBTQ rights nationally, as evidenced by the legalization of gay marriage in states across the country. This year, one part of that acronym that had been overlooked in the past emerged as a key priority and force for progress on Georgetown’s campus: transgender students.
For the first time in Georgetown’s history, a visible population of transgender students brought transgender issues to the attention of the wider Georgetown community. The willingness of these students to speak publicly about their experiences, coupled with structural changes to LGBTQ organizations, amplified the student body’s knowledge of the experience of transgender students.
At the beginning of the year, GU Pride added a trans* representative to its executive board, electing Celeste Chisholm (COL ’15) to the position. In her role, Chisholm, who is spending this semester in Japan, spoke frequently to campus media and led programming and advocacy.
“Once there was the very visible transgender rep position, as well as a more visible community, it encouraged The Hoya and the Voice to cover these issues, and that led to more transgender-led initiatives,” GU Pride President Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) said. “Part of it was by happenstance of having a larger out community, and part was action by Pride and other folks to make transgender issues a priority.”
LGBTQ Center Director Shiva Subbaraman connected changing attitudes at Georgetown to a changing climate nationally.
“There have always been trans students on campus, but I think the level of comfort and general level of openness around trans issues has certainly been more this year. Some of it has changed nationally — nationally there’s more awareness around trans issues,” Subbaraman said.
Lloyd identified several key moments for transgender rights over the course of the year, including a commitment to add a unisex bathroom to every floor of the Northeast Triangle Residence Hall and other dorms going forward, and a moment during the vice presidential debate in the Georgetown University Student Association executive race in which every candidate said his or her ticket would support gender-neutral housing.
Lexi Dever (COL ’16), the current GU Pride trans* representative, pointed to the importance of awareness over this year.
“People are more aware we exist, and we have a lot of things we have to deal with to have the same basic privileges other Georgetown students have,” Dever said.
Dever credited an article published in September for beginning the yearlong push for awareness of transgender issues. Later in the year, Dever authored a viewpoint further explaining the challenges transgender students face in everyday matters such as living with students of the same gender or changing their names through the University Registrar.
Over the next year, advocates for transgender rights expect to see greater push for policy changes as well as continued expansion of cultural acceptance. Dever met with university officials earlier this week to discuss easing the process of name changes for transgender students and removing quotations from changed names on university documents for all students who request such changes.
“Every year we hope it will get better and students will be more empowered to be who they are,” Subbaraman said. “Being trans is just part of who they are — that they’re not just present on campus as a trans person, that they’re present on campus as artists and musicians, and OAs and RAs and what they love to do.”

Beginning with a record-breaking $100 million gift from Frank McCourt Jr. (CAS ’75) in September, this fiscal year was the most successful fundraising year in Georgetown’s 225-year history.
On Sept. 18, the university announced that McCourt, the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, would fund the creation of the McCourt School of Public Policy, replacing the Georgetown Public Policy Institute.
However, McCourt’s gift was not without controversy, stemming from his past outside of Georgetown. During McCourt’s tenure as Dodgers owner, the team became mired in over $600 million of debt and was at the center of McCourt’s very public 2009 divorce, the most costly in California’s history.
The university honored McCourt’s gift with an academic ceremony Oct. 8 as well as a larger black-tie ceremony featuring members of Congress the following day.
Georgetown also received a second large gift, a $10 million donation from Alberto and Olga Maria Beeck (SFS ’81), to fund the creation of the Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation in February.
According to Vice President for Advancement R. Bartley Moore, this corresponds with a nationwide move toward strategy- and initiative-based gifts.
“Donors of larger gifts increasingly want to connect their gift with an explicit strategy for the growth of the institution,” Moore said. “Giving is less charitable, and it’s more of a philanthropic investment. That’s not to say that giving is not a form of charity — the donors do not want anything material in exchange for their generosity, but they want to know that they will have an impact.”
According to Moore, by March 31 the university raised $189 million in new commitments and pledges, surpassing its original goal of $166 million. With three more months to go in the university’s fiscal year, Moore projected that the university would raise a total of $225 million by June 30.
“We are confident that we will break the record for total dollars this year,” Moore said.
The $189 million includes several donations of hundreds or thousands of dollars as well a smaller — but potentially record — number of principal gifts, which are over $1 million. At this point, the total number of principal gifts, 18, is lower than last year’s 21 at this point. Moore said he expected the fiscal-year-end total to be 25 or 26, compared to last year’s 28.
The Office of Advancement has also been tracking the percentage of undergraduate alumni donors that give to the university each year, which historically averages 25 percent. Moore said he expected over 33 percent of undergraduate alumni to give this year, an increase from last year’s 32 percent.
“We are very, very proud of that progress, but we’re aiming for 35 percent in 2016,” Moore said.
Ultimately, this year’s fundraising success brings the Campaign for Georgetown closer to its 2016 end goal of $1.5 billion. Moore said that, by March 31, the capital campaign had reached $1.26 billion, and is expected to hit $1.3 billion by the end of the fiscal year.
“We could finish $150 million ahead of our total goal,” Moore said. “The projection that I’ve been making to our leadership and board of directors is that success in the $1.5 billion goal is feeling increasingly confident.”

While the Year in Review highlights the events and themes that have defined the past year on the Hilltop, some stories have not been neatly tied up in time for the conclusion of classes.
On the morning of March 18, residents of McCarthy Hall awoke in confusion to the sounds of sirens, and federal agents partitioning off a McCarthy 6 corridor. In the days that followed, it would be revealed that Daniel Milzman (COL ’16), a physics major on a pre-med track, had been manufacturing the biological toxin ricin in his dorm room. Milzman, 19, the son of a research director at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, with whom he has co-authored several articles, served as captain and founder of the Quiz Bowl team on campus as well as a member of the Secular Student Alliance.
Since March 21, Milzman has been held in D.C. jail after U.S. District Court Chief Justice Richard Roberts overturned a magistrate judge’s earlier ruling to release Milzman into his parents’ care to pursue psychiatric treatment March 31, instead ruling that Milzman be placed under “rigorous suicide watch” due to the possibility that Milzman could have been manufacturing the toxin for use on other individuals or himself. A status hearing will take place May 1 with a trial date forthcoming.
 
Eighteen minutes — the amount of time it took Georgetown University Police Department officials to remove members of H*yas for Choice attempting to table in Healy Circle during the Cardinal O’Connor Conference on Life in January. The group was attempting to test the university’s Free Speech Policy that claimed that free speech is allowed in places other than Red Square.
At a subsequent speech forum Jan. 16, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson told the campus community to expect a version of an updated free speech policy no later than the last day of classes.
“By the end of the semester, we will produce a document that tries to really clarify and smooth out a lot of these issues. It will not solve all of them, but it is the best step forward to try to get clearer and more explicit,” Olson said at the time. “Before the last day of classes this semester, we will produce at least a version of that.”
While the university has yet to produce the revision, Olson assured that it would be ready before students go home for summer.
“We’re almost there. We’ve had very good work in the Speech and Expression Committee. It’s been intensive work during the semester and those folks are finalizing it and putting the finishing touches on it,” Olson said Wednesday of the work of the committee, which is composed of four faculty members and four student representatives.
Olson highlighted some changes that can be expected from the revised policy.
“It’s about expanding student opportunities for tabling around campus, it’s about clarifying rights and opportunities that exist for students, making sure students are aware of those,” Olson said. “It is aimed at providing a clear pathway for students who have concerns about the speech and expression policy to raise them and have them responded to in an effective way.”
In the meantime, H*yas for Choice and fellow unrecognized campus organizations are waiting in limbo to determine how the new policies will affect their groups.
“Until the Division of Student Affairs and other offices ensure that all members of the campus community are able to and feel comfortable expressing their own ideas, it is impossible for Georgetown to brand itself as an institution that promotes meaningful dialogue,” H*yas for Choice President Abby Grace (SFS ’16) wrote in an email.

Recent Alumna
Ten weeks after her graduation from Georgetown, Bess Rosenzweig (COL ’13) died in a plane crash in Kenya on July 25 that also claimed the lives of her mother and the plane’s pilot. According to friends, the psychology major with a minor in French and a certificate in African studies epitomized the concept of a free spirit. An avid traveller, Rosenzweig, who was 22, relished the opportunity to explore different cultures — she had a particular affinity for the African continent — and connect with strangers and friends alike. She spent time volunteering as a teacher outside Nairobi, Kenya, and had climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.
 
Professor
Professor Wayne Knoll died Nov. 10, 2013, after a three-month battle with an incurable and inoperable cancerous tumor. The former Jesuit priest joined the Georgetown faculty in 1972, teaching English for 41 years. Knoll was renowned for his capacity for love, whether in regard to his students, which included University President John J. DeGioia, the university or his wife. He received the Edward B. Bunn Award for excellence in teaching in 2006.
 
 
Former Mascot
The pioneer of Georgetown’s costumed mascot tradition, Patrick Sheehan (CAS ’81), was killed in a car crash in the Bronx, N.Y., on Nov. 9. Sheehan donned the first Jack the Bulldog suit in 1977, his freshman year, after an Alumni Association group chose him because of his enthusiasm and personality. His tenure as mascot aligned with the heyday of Georgetown men’s basketball, with the legendary coach John Thompson Jr.’s assumption of the helm in 1972. Sheehan was known for his antics during basketball games.
Sheehan, 54, was a managing director for public finance at Wells Fargo & Co. in New York. His son George attends Georgetown.
 
 
Alumnus and Boxing Trainer
Tom Quinn (CAS ’55) was a man of many titles: United States Marine, businessman, consultant, actor and Yates Field House employee. Yet one title has enshrined him in the pantheon of Georgetown legends: the 1955 NCAA Eastern heavyweight boxing champion. Quinn, who died Jan. 5 in Teaneck, N.J., at 79 from complications related to diabetes, was the university’s last title winner in boxing; his gloves hang in a case in McDonough Arena. After graduation, the Athletic Hall of Fame member held a variety of successful careers before pursuing acting, with parts in “Enemy of the State” and “The Wire,” in addition to his work in D.C. theater. He was hired as a boxing trainer at Yates in 2004, and was recognized by students as a friendly employee GOCards at the gym’s front desk.
 
 
Professor
Former professor and economist Adhip Chaudhuri, who retired last year, died Jan. 13 after a three-year battle with lung cancer. Chaudhuri, who was born in India and immigrated to the United States in 1972, taught international economics at Georgetown in both D.C. and Doha, Qatar, for 34 years, twice winning professor of the year. Chaudhuri encouraged students to incorporate social justice into all aspects of their Georgetown education. His children, Maya (SFS ’13) and Neal (COL ’16) Chaudhuri, followed their father to Georgetown, where they, too, participated in social justice programs.
Above all, Chaudhuri, at 62, remained devoted to knowledge and education.
“Right until the very end when he couldn’t stand up to teach, he would say to me, ‘I have to sit down and do this,’ but he did it because he loved doing it,” Chaudhuri’s friend Amit Shah said.
 
Student
Mark Adamsson (SFS ’15) died from lung and heart failure attributed to medical reasons in the Dominican Republic during spring break this past March.
Adamsson, 22, a Swedish international student, was universally described as academically strong and curious. He attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., where he captained the varsity tennis team, which remained undefeated and won the Class A New England Championship his senior year.
“He was a very positive and optimistic person who would discover good and redeeming qualities in himself and also in others,” French professor Peter Janssens said.
