Ibrahim Mohamed came to Senator Chris Coons’s (D-Del.) speech on African economic, political and security challenges prepared to grill the senator with questions on American policy response toward the current drought in Somalia.
“I came here to ask angry questions,” Mohamed, an English for Heritage Language Speakers scholar at Georgetown, told Coons after the speech ended. “But I was very surprised by what you said.”
Coons, who was named chair of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on African Affairs in February, spoke Thursday about the need to improve U.S. relations with Africa.
Although he said he had little relevant experience when appointed to the position, Coons studied abroad at the University of Nairobi in Kenya during his junior year at Amherst College. After graduation, he returned to Kenya as a volunteer relief worker.
Coons said his experiences left him with a lingering disillusionment with the U.S. government’s policy toward Africa as well as with a deep sense of humility.
“I still remember the graciousness and hospitality of people who had nothing to give, who were on the brink of starvation,” he said when describing his time living with the Maasai people.
Coons also recalled a conversation with a young Maasai man, who angrily told him, “All I know about you is that your people make weapons that can fly around the world and destroy everything I have. My cattle and my land are at risk because of the weapons you made. What is wrong with you and your people?”
The overall tone of his speech, however, was optimistic. Coons commended the Bush administration’s efforts against AIDS, noting that the policy improved millions of Africans’ perceptions of the United States. However, he was careful to stress that American aid to Africa needed to be viewed as a partnership, not as an act of charity.
Coons noted that ensuring that lawmaking and government institutions in Africa were fair and transparent is critical for the country’s national resource distribution and living standards.
For Mohamed, the senator’s respect for Africans was impressive.
“There is a Somali proverb, if someone gives you something to eat, you will be ashamed,” he said. “So when the United States gives us food, then tells us to do something, we will do it. Development aid always comes with strings attached. However, if the senator’s ideas are actually implemented, then Africa will be successful.”
Coons wrapped up his speech by calling on the United States to continue supporting African development, despite difficult financial times.
“As the most powerful, most responsible, most morally challenged, most morally challenging people in human history, I hope we can live in harmony with the rest of the world,” he said.

Following a university working group’s recommendation to increase the hiring of diverse faculty members, the percentage of minority faculty members on the main campus has jumped from 12 to 14 percent in 2011.
Since the beginning of this year, the university has hired seven minority faculty members, according to Vice President for Institutional Diversity and Equity RosemaryKilkenny. Two new deans also identify as minority faculty members.
“If you look at the stats, you will see tremendous success in response to the initiative,” University Provost James O’Donnell said.
In 2009, University President John J. DeGioia launched the Diversity Initiative to address inclusiveness on campus. As part of the effort, three working groups on admissions, academics and student life examined diversity on the Hilltop in their respective areas.
In its 2010 report, the working group on academics called for the hiring of more minority faculty members as well as more course offerings focusing on underrepresented populations. Shortly after the report’s release, however, the percentage of minority faculty dipped slightly, from 13 percent in 2008 to 12 percent in 2010.
Advocates hope that the recent increase in the percentage of minority faculty signals a reversal of this trend. Kilkenny also noted that two of Georgetown’s recent hires hold key positions in the administration.
“What is noteworthy is that Georgetown hired its first Asian-American dean and its second African-American dean,” she said.
Martin Iguchi, dean of the School of Nursing and Health Studies, and David Thomas, dean of the McDonough School of Business, both took up their positions at the beginning of the academic year.
Iguchi, who came to the NHS after serving as the chairman of the department of community health sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles, said part of Georgetown’s appeal was the strong sense of community he perceived.
A self-described advocate for diversity, Iguchi said he planned to continue his efforts by actively fostering an environment where all faculty members are able to succeed.
“In my past positions, it was clear that the greatest threat to increasing faculty and student diversity was complacency rather than discrimination,” he said.
Despite the rise in minority representation, some think there is more to work to be done in promoting diversity at Georgetown.
“It is good that there are more diverse faculty, but that doesn’t mean the university has changed much by adding seven minority faculty,” said Stephanie Frenel (SFS ’12), who sat on the academic working group during her freshman year. “I’d love to see how diverse the faculty becomes over five or 10 years.”
José Casanova, a professor of sociology, said he thinks adjusting hiring strategies could further address the issue.
“I understand the university has a tight budget and that it is hard to change an institution,” she said. “But I think it is important to educate the departments to identify candidates and to encourage the departments to hire two rather than just one when there are extraordinary candidates.”
O’Donnell, on the other hand, indicated the importance of selecting faculty who are the best fit.
“I tell the departments and the deans that when we are hiring someone, we must expect that they will be here for more than 30 years,” he said. “So it is worth the wait and work to get it right if they are going to be here quite a while.”
Another suggested asset of having a more diverse faculty comes from a recent paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The study, which examined students at a community college in Arizona, found that having minority faculty teach minority students helps eliminate the racial achievement gap that exists between white students and minorities in the classroom.
Leslie Hinkson, a professor of sociology who teaches a course on race and ethnicity, said that having a professor from a similar background can help make students feel more comfortable.
“Seeing someone who looks like me pushes them to go to [me] a professor to ask for help,”Hinkson said.
Even with the university stepping up its minority recruitment, retention remains a significant hurdle.
“The more visible and successful our faculty is, the more likely other institutions will come and compete with us,” O’Donnell said. “But we make sure the faculty who are contributing to the university are happy here, gaining both visible dignity and the right salary.”
For Frenel, the importance of diversity goes beyond mere statistics.
“I think we as a university have downplayed the values we claim identify Georgetown, specifically social justice,” Frenel said. “Although I am not a faculty member, I think the existing professors would appreciate having more faculties contributing to this justice work from different angles andperspectives.”

Two laptops, as well as a number of electronics and an undisclosed amount of U.S. currency, were stolen from two separate residence halls on Friday and Saturday, according to a Public Safety Alert.
At 11:15 a.m. Friday, a student reported that his laptop, some electronics and U.S. currency were stolen from his room in LXR Hall while he was asleep, according to the Department of Public Safety. The student did not see the suspect, and there were no other witnesses.
The following day, at around 5:13 p.m., another student reported that an unidentified suspect stole a laptop from an unoccupied residence in Harbin Hall. A black male subject, in his late 30s to early 40sand approximately 5’8″ to 5’10” in height, was reported to have been looking around the residence hall floor suspiciously. The suspect is further described as having a thin build and wearing a dark cap with a blue jacket, blue jeans and white sneakers.
The thefts followed shortly after the burglary of another Harbin room Thursday. Reports of an unknown black male aged 19 to 21 years of age wearing a navy blue ball cap with a red bill, a black hooded jacket, blue jeans rolled at the cuffs, and black boots suspiciously looking around these floors of HarbinHall surfaced on Friday.
DPS canvassed both areas after all three burglaries with negative results. They are continuing to investigate all three incidents in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police Department.
Representatives of DPS and the Office of Communications could not be reached for comment at press time.

When Derrick Philson was first asked to participate in a support group for male caregivers of disabled children, he was reluctant to get involved. After Philson’s daughter was seriously injured in a car accident when she was 16, he had trouble believing that there was any program that could provide him with the help he needed.
“[The accident] almost destroyed me,” he said. “I didn’t want to join this group and be promised all of these things and then be disappointed.”
But the Male Caregiver Advocacy Support group, a program co-sponsored by the Georgetown University School of Medicine and D.C. Health Care Services for Children with Special Needs, proved to be a very different kind of support group.
“What I realized is that [I wasn’t being invited] to get anything out of the group, [I was invited] to contribute,” Philson said. “[After a meeting with the Advocacy Group] I began what I call ‘a fight for life,’ for my daughter and for myself.”
The idea for this support organization was originally conceived by Cecil Doggette, a regular attendee at the weekly meetings of the Parent Advocacy Leaders Support Group, which is another outreach program of HCS for Children with Special Needs. Doggette wanted to become a better advocate for his granddaughter, who has multiple disabilities.
Upon attending the PALS meetings, Doggette noted the gender disparity as he found himself one of only two male attendees.
According to Doggette, when he reached out to the male partners of women who attended the PALS meetings, the fathers responded that they felt uncomfortable in such an emotional setting.
“They did not feel like they could ever be heard,” he said.
Soon after that, he sought HCS for Children with Special Needs’s help in creating a safe environment for these fathers to express concerns and ask questions.
What began with just one member soon grew to a group of eight and then multiplied to 30 participants. Today the group provides support to 210 male caregivers and their disabled children.
About 25 to 35 members attend each weekly meeting, during which the program provides transportation, a hot meal and childcare in addition to a “check-in session” where members are free to discuss any issues that are troubling them.
The meetings also include information sessions and presentations made by SOM students, who give medical advice to the men about how to care for their children.
According to Philson, the partnership with SOM has allowed the caregivers to voice their medical concerns and receive information about disparities in the healthcare system.
“It’s about learning patience and tolerance,” he said.
Robert Henry, who came to his first Wednesday night meeting to learn how to assist his nephew with cerebral palsy and better understand his son’s own struggles with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, said that the parents and medical students have a reciprocal relationship.
“It’s a win-win situation, for the med students, the caregivers and most importantly, the children,” Henry said, noting that the group offers these aspiring doctors a peek into what will become their everyday lives.
“[They] are learning about black males who have children with special needs in a black community. These are things you can’t learn in a book; they’re trying to be the best doctors they can be and we’re trying to be the best parents we can be.”
Doggette said that he recognizes the SOM as one of the most important driving forces behind the group’s work advocacy work, adding that he hopes it will continue to support the program’s efforts at expansion and awareness building.
Henry said that with the help of its organizational partners, the MCAS group will continue to have a lasting impact.
“This is an incredibly unique program in that it offers a place for me to share my concerns as a parent and an advocate for my children, and discuss it with men confronting similar issues. We’re not afraid to be men here, to be real about our feelings and about our concerns,” he said. “We know that a journey of 1,000 miles begins with that very first step. It’s not necessarily Wednesdays that are important in this program, it’s what we do on that next day, and the day after that.”
GU medical students who participated in the program could not be reached for comment.

For a batch of about 25 soon-to-be enrolled graduate students in the Family Nurse Practitioner program, getting a master’s degree will be cyber-friendly.
 
Later this spring, these students will start taking three classes in a high-tech, face-to-face environment as part of the School of Nursing and Health Studies’ new graduate program; the new online master’s degree track becomes the university’s first.
 
 
 
After receiving approval from Middle States – the academic accreditation authority of the area – for the program this week, the program will now begin to process inquiries about enrollment, according to Jeanne Matthews, interim chair of the department of nursing. Applicants for this spring’s class will graduate in August 2012.
 
 
 
atthews stressed that although the program will now be offered to a broader geographical audience, the scholars will be carefully vetted. She added that the current Family Nurse Practitioner program would continue to operate as usual on campus.
 
 
 
“Our vision is to expand our reach in terms of national impact,” Matthews said. “We believe our nursing program’s values give students a professional grounding that benefit them and the people they ultimately serve.”
 
 
 
atthews said that she is excited about the variety of students who will be able to participate in the Georgetown educational tradition – students once constrained by travel issues, families or other commitments.
 
 
 
“We are particularly excited by the opportunity to extend over time our educational mission to rural and underserved areas of our country,” interim NHS Dean Julie DeLoia said in an email.
 
 
 
atthews also said that NHS administrators expect the program to impact students across the nation.
 
 
 
“Our hope is that the values our program embodies will be provided to more students in this online platform, allowing our graduates to have a broader impact on the nation’s health,” Matthews said.
 
 
 
While DeLoia said that this was not the first online nursing program of its kind, she said it adds something special to the Georgetown academic experience.
 
 
 
“What truly excites us – related to our contribution to this type of learning modality – is that we are combining Georgetown’s academically solid, values-based nursing curriculum with a dynamic learning management system that will result in a unique educational experience for our advanced practice nursing students,” she said.”

Former Georgetown Law student David Grosso (L ’01) launched his campaign for a D.C. Council At-Large seat Saturday, running on a platform of reduced spending and increased attention to the District’s political issues.
“I am running because we need a fresh voice, because I want to revolutionize how the city spends money, demand that real school reform continues, rather than stalls and improve our local economy, because we all know we can’t wait for Congress to do that for us,” Grosso said in a speech to supporters.
In his campaign kick-off speech at Colonel Brooks Tavern near Catholic University, Grosso criticized what he deemed wasteful spending by the District.
“A city that spends over $17,000 per resident per year [like D.C. does] should have sidewalks made of gold and a platinum-rated school system.”
Grosso also pledged to help the poorest of the D.C. community in the role of Council member, citing his experiences with service as prerequisites for taking up their cause.
Before attending college, Grosso took three trips to Honduras to help refugees fleeing El Salvador. He also devoted a year to serving homeless women and children in San Antonio, Texas, while living on ten dollars a week.
Grosso attributes much of his understanding of justice and service to his time at Georgetown Law School, where he studied under Fr. Robert Drinin, S.J., a well-known activist for social justice.
“He was a man of service. He was a man of giving back to the community,” Grosso said.
Drinan, who served in the House of Representatives from 1971-1981 until Pope John Paul II declared that no priest should hold office, taught legal ethics for 26 years at the Georgetown University Law School.
As a Georgetown grad and a D.C. native, Grosso also focused on the issues surrounding the 2010 Campus Plan and the District’s push for greater autonomy from the federal government.
He suggested that Georgetown utilize extra space on D.C. public school campuses, offering a unique partnership for city schools while allowing Georgetown to expand its programs.
“We ought to encourage universities to branch out throughout the city,” he said.
As a Washingtonian, Grosso said that he also supports autonomy for the District from federal authorities, another hot-button issue in local politics.
“Until we’re a state, we’re never going to have the power that we need to really make a difference for our people. We need to get radical, and I am ready to get arrested tomorrow,” he said.
Grosso is kicking off his campaign a year before the 2012 City Council elections.
As an independent candidate, Grosso will forego the primary election process and head straight to the November general election. The laws of the D.C. Council dictate that only three of the five at-large seats can be held by a single party, preventing Grosso from running for the Democratic party, which currently holds three seats until 2014. In order to appear on the ballot, he must garner 3,000 signatures by this May.
Grosso said that ultimately his independent campaign will focus on representing all the citizens of the District.
“D.C. may be the nation’s capital, but it’s our hometown,” he said. “I will fight every day to ensure that the D.C. government represents all D.C. residents, that the rights of every person are respected and that this country’s capital can rise to even greater heights.”

The Georgetown Waterfront Park, a neighborhood recreational space that has been undergoing on-and-off renovations for the last 30 years, reopened early last week.
The transformation of the park is a $24 million project funded by a combination of private contributions and grants from the D.C. and federal governments.
The Philadelphia-based landscape planning firm Wallace, Roberts and Todd designed the park to reflect the aesthetics of the Potomac River .
The space features a promenade with three overlooks, a bike trail joining the capital Crescent Trail with the Rock Creek Trail, walking paths, a fountain plaza and an amphitheatre that offers views of boat races occurring on the water.
“The park is wonderful for all the communities in Georgetown,” Ron Lewis, chair of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission for Ward 2E, said. “It’s a place to enjoy a part of the community that has been closed off for a long time.”
The 9.5 acre park, which was aimed at providing additional space for Georgetown’s cyclists, joggers and pedestrians, was constructed in two stages.
Wallace, Roberts and Todd first developed its plan for the park in 2005 and established a budget of $15 million for the construction, which was to be completed in 18 months.
The first phase of construction finished in 2008 and the second began in the spring of 2009.
But the project was significantly delayed in early 2010 after contractors found an underground slab of concrete that prevented any further digging. The completion of the park ultimately required over $2.2 million in additional funds and an extension of the project’s timeline.
Samantha Smolka (COL ’15) said that though she does not travel to the park often, she is interested in spending more time at the waterfront’s newest attraction.
“It’s not somewhere you would frequently visit, but it’s nice to stop by on a sunny afternoon,” she said.
Other students, like Jill Jagoe (NHS ’15), appreciate the benefits of having such a large public space in the neighborhood.
“It’d be a good place to go to get off campus during high-stress times with friends,” she said. “It adds a relaxing atmosphere to sit back and enjoy the beauty of Georgetown.”

Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a major donor to the university and one of the world’s richest men, is under investigation after a Spanish magistrate reopened a sexual assault case against him.
Alwaleed is accused of drugging and raping a 20-year-old model in August 2008 while sailing on his luxury yacht near the island of Ibiza in the Spanish Mediterranean. The renewal of the case comes more than a year after it was closed by a separate magistrate due to insufficient evidence.
Prince Alwaleed, nephew of His Royal Highness King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, is a businessman, investor and major stakeholder in News Corp. and Citigroup. Forbes ranked him the 26th richest man in the world and the richest man in the Middle East, valuing his fortune at nearly $20 billion.
In 2005, the prince donated $20 million each to Georgetown and Harvard to establish academic programs at the schools focused on Muslim-Christian interfaith dialogue.
Georgetown’s program was titled the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding and was later renamed the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal CMCU in his honor.
The donations generated controversy among the GU and Harvard communities, The Hoya reported on Jan. 13, 2006.
Former U.S. House Representative Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) wrote letters to University President John J. DeGioia and former Harvard University President Lawrence Summers protesting the donation.
“Institutions like Harvard University and Georgetown University should not accept funding from a family that bankrolls terrorist organizations,” Weiner wrote.
But the center’s director, John Esposito, said at the time that the donation’s purpose was more important than its origin.
“The issue is not who the donor is but rather what the money is going to be used for,” he said.
In the current case, Prince Alwaleed has maintained his innocence.
In an interview with The New York Times, Heba Fatani, a spokeswoman for his investment affiliate Kingdom Holding Division, said that the assault never occurred. Fatani added that the Prince did not vacation in Ibiza in 2008 nor make use of any yachts.
In the original complaint, the model, identified only as Soraya and represented by Spanish attorney Javier Beloqui, alleged that she was invited to the yacht while at a nightclub in Ibiza. Medical tests later confirmed traces of a sleep-inducing chemical in her system as well as semen. Beloqui has called for the prince to give DNA samples, but none have been provided yet.
Despite the results of the rape kit, officials found no evidence of bodily harm on the victim, prompting their previous decision to close the case.
The accuser also claimed that the dismissal of the case was due to the influence of Prince Alwaleed as a member of Saudi royalty. Prince Alwaleed has been summoned to appear before a Spanish provincial court for the continuation of court proceedings.
The Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding declined to comment.

The university has dropped its proposal to install a loop road parallel to Archibald Glover Park from its 2010 Campus Plan, according to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr.
The original loop road plan had intended to divert Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle buses from neighborhood streets to a new route behind Yates Field House and McDonough Arena. The project’s layout has been altered so that buses are now set to run past Harbin Hall.
The change comes after community groups and the District Department of Transportation opposed the plan in D.C. Zoning Commission hearings last spring.
The initial proposal for the road provoked opposition from neighborhood groups and DDOT because of its potential impacts on parkland and traffic patterns.
The decision to modify the plan for the loop road reflected the university’s efforts to weigh the needs of both the neighborhood and students, according to Kerr.
“Throughout this process, our goal was to balance the interests of our neighbors with the needs of the university,” she said in a university statement. “We looked for alternatives that would meet our goals of pedestrian safety and walkways and centralizing buses in the middle of campus, away from the neighborhood streets. The Harbin location meets those goals.”
University officials hope that the proposed turnaround location will enhance access to campus, in addition to assuaging neighborhood concerns.
“It will allow improved access to the center of campus for our faculty, staff and students in a way that also improves pedestrian walkways and addresses pedestrian safety concerns,” Kerr said.
Citing a lack of detail, neighborhood representatives were hesitant to comment on the new plan.
Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E Chair Ron Lewis said he was unsure of the full implications of the new proposal.
“I haven’t seen the details yet,” he said. “If all of the GUTS buses are going to use the Canal Road entrance … then it would be fine. It could be fine. It’s all in the details.”
Georgetown University Student Association President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) said that he is unsure of how the new plan will affect campus life.
“I’m not too sure what the implications of changing that are,” he said. “Hopefully this situation doesn’t have a negative impact on student life.”
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson declined to comment on the new plan.

By connecting international classrooms through modern technology, the student-led One World Youth Project aims to cultivate global thinking on and off the Hilltop.
Founded by Jess Rimington (SFS ’09), the initiative focuses on bringing college students to public middle and high schools to encourage cross-cultural, global and community awareness, according to communications director Anjali Daryanani (SFS ’11). As part of the learning process, student leaders facilitate face-to-face connections between domestic and international schools via social media platforms such as Skype, Yammer and Chatfe.
While the idea originated in Rimington’s high school, the current version of the program, backed by Georgetown University and the University of Prishtina in Kosovo, began in 2009. Georgetown now partners with Hart Middle School and Columbia Heights Education Campus, while the University of Prishtina connects with Elena Gjika Elementary school in Kosovo.
“[The project is intended for] Georgetown students to feel a sense of community with the entire city, not just Georgetown,” said Zenen Jaimes (SFS ’13), the project ambassador. “Sometimes we get caught up in our own little bubble and fail to see how our talents can help benefit the community,” Jaimes said. “A lot of us can spout off the challenges facing South Sudan or recount the details of the Libyan conflict, [but] many Georgetown students still see anything beyond Georgetown as one big mystery.”
Peer leaders involved do not take the commitment to breaking out of the Georgetown bubble lightly. New recruits are subject to an extensive training program to ensure high-quality instruction. Participating university students engage in three training sessions over two semesters, including a summer session, site visitation and remote instruction via social media.
Despite comprehensive training and general support from schools involved, One World Youth Project has faced several setbacks to its growth. Jaimes cited bureaucracy and budget cuts within the D.C. public school system as recurring problems. Unruly conduct within the classrooms also disrupts the virtual learning process, although some of the volunteers have found ways to counteract bad behavior.
“Many of the students love music and would break out into song during class, so instead of always reprimanding that, we try to incorporate music in a more productive way within the lesson plans,” Avila said.
Avila recounted a time when a Kosovan student on video chat with her classroom began singing Beyoncé’s “Halo” and the entire D.C. classroom joined in.
“It’s really an enlightening moment for them to see how much they share with someone halfway across the world, but also how much they can learn from one another,” she said.
In January, the program plans to add eight more international universities, including Pakistan’s National University of Sciences and Technology, France’s Ecole Normale Supérieure and South Africa’s University of Cape Town, along with domestic partnerships with Franklin & Marshall College, Boston University and College of the Menominee Nation.
According to Daryanani, the organization is also arranging to integrate the program in over 100 cities worldwide, with a target network of over 1,500 university students and 8,000 secondary school students by 2015.
“Our global perspective needs to come from a local focus. Learning more about our own community can only help us as we try to tackle the challenges of the modern world,” Jaimes said.

The Georgetown Voice has been ordered by the Center for Student Programs to vacate their office by Oct. 3 and move into a significantly smaller space after three students affiliated with the newsmagazine recently damaged neighboring Leavey Center offices.
Citing violations of the Student Organization Office Use Agreement, CSP instructed the leadership of the student-run publication to pack up their equipment and head down the hall to Leavey 424, effectively swapping offices with Georgetown University Debate.
The sanction comes after two Voice staffers, Sam Buckley (COL ’14) and John Flanagan (SFS ’14), along with former Voice staffer Eric Pilch (COL ’12), allegedly destroyed a significant portion of The Voice’s ceiling while trying to evade Department of Public Safety officers on Aug. 28. The trio, who allegedly crawled through the ceiling into nearby offices of the fourth floor of Leavey, have been charged with misdemeanors for destruction of property under $1,000. Their first court hearing is Wednesday.
In all, damage to a large number of ceiling tiles and the infrastructure of the surrounding offices as well as The Voice’s space caused over $4,000 worth of repairs.
Flanagan is currently recovering from back and leg injuries after exiting through a fourth-floor window while trying to elude DPS personnel; he and Buckley have since been dismissed from The Voice staff.
According to Erika Cohen-Derr, the director of CSP, every student group is able to apply for space at the end of the school year. She declined to comment on The Voice’s ability to regain their old space.
Further repercussions are possible for the publication. Cohen-Derr said that groups affected by the damage — including The Hoya and the debate team — could choose to file a complaint based on a violation of the Student Organization Standards.
Tim Shine, (MSB ’12), editor-in-chief of The Voice, is petitioning Associate Vice President for Student Affairs Jeanne Lord to repeal the penalty.
“In the short term, we will still be able to get a paper out. … But I don’t know that in the long run it’ll have the same quality as years past,” Shine said.
While he does not currently anticipate that the room change will affect the size or schedule of the newsmagazine, it will greatly alter the publication’s production schedule. According to Shine, the current numbers of 25 to 30 people who come to the office to put out an issue once per week will not be able to fit in the smaller space.
“The impact in the long run will inhibit our ability to retain and develop a large staff of writers and photographers,” Shine said.

The international development certificate in the School of Foreign Service could require an additional course if it receives curricular approval.
Although juniors and seniors will be unaffected by the new changes, underclassmen pursuing the certificate may be required to take an additional class which focuses on building quantitative analytical skills.
“It’s imperative that students graduate with a quantitative tool kit that allows them to respond to and analyze future data,” Dean of the SFS Carol Lancaster said.
Raj Desai, who was appointed director of the IDEV program in July, anticipates that the proposed changes will take effect after receiving the curriculum committee’s approval later this semester.
“We’re being flexible, and as of now, there is no one course that students will have to take. But, we want students to have the skills necessary to thrive in a rapidly changing field,” Desai said.
Once the changes are officially announced, Desai plans to hold an open forum for all students pursuing international development to explain the exact requirements of the certificate and the rationale behind the changes.
“[It is an] interdisciplinary certificate designed not only for economics majors, but rather designed to engage politics, economics, social change, culture, et cetera. We’re not making changes because we see the program as lacking in any way,” Lancaster said. “We’ve been very pleased, and we’re in a position of being able to strengthen all of our programs, particularly the IDEV certificate.”
The IDEV certificate has increasingly attracted students since its creation in 2006, now ranking as the most popular certificate in the SFS. The administration came under fire from student advocates afterDesai was tapped to replace the program’s founding director Maria Luise Wagner in February, sparking rumors that the undergraduate certificate was slated for elimination. At that time, Lancaster assured those concerned that the certificate was not in danger and that Desai, as a tenured faculty member, would strengthen the curriculum.
Desai brings real-world and academic experience to the program. He has worked for the World Bank Group, the Asian Development Bank and the United Nations Development Program. Currently he teaches in both the SFS and the government department and works with the Brookings Institute.
Desai says he is committed to adding value to the certificate and increasing the marketability of the unique Georgetown initiative.
“My objective [is] to carve out the value added so that employers and graduate schools will look at it, and the certificate will signal something extra as far as the Georgetown label goes,” he said.
Correction: This article originally stated that Raj Desai was appointed to his position in February. In fact, he was appointed in July with the change being announced in February. This version has since been corrected.
