The American Dream Accounts Act of 2012, proposed last week by Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), would create a financial network to help lower-income high school students save for college.
The bill aims to make college more accessible by setting up an online platform to track students’ progress through primary and secondary education, establishing college savings plans and awarding grants to organizations that help lower-income students prepare for college.
According to the text of the bill, only 9.8 percent of low-income students attend a four-year college or university.
“Lack of knowledge about how to apply to and pay for an institution of higher education is a barrier for many low-income students and students who would be in the first generation in their families to attend [college],” the bill reads.
The act seeks to address this lack of information by awarding competitive grants to organizations that provide students with opportunities to learn about financial literacy, with preference given to organizations willing to contribute seed money to students’ college savings accounts.
“Dream Accounts” would both track students’ academic progress and serve as college savings accounts.
According to Georgetown’s Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming, while the bill is aimed at partnership with high schools, it is consistent with Georgetown’s mission of facilitating access to higher education.
“[The bill’s] goal of encouraging low-income students to pursue higher education is very consistent with Georgetown’s mission, evidenced in our scholarship programs and … [other] initiatives,” Fleming said. “It’s fair to say we would be sympathetic.”
However, Fleming cautioned that the bill will have difficulty passing through a House of Representatives preoccupied this week by the federal budget proposal, which itself includes possible cuts to federal Pell Grants and a hike in the student interest rate.
“It’s an admirable piece of legislation, but getting attention on Capitol Hill in this environment will no doubt be challenging,” Fleming said.

Founded in the 1970s by students interested in medieval history and culture, the Medieval Club provides an extracurricular outlet not just for Medieval Studies students, but for all students with a penchant for history.
“It’s a gathering of people who are interested in medieval-type things, even if it’s not purely academic,” President Sorina Radu (SFS ’12) said.
Treasurer Melissa Riggio (COL ’14) joined after hearing about the group through the Georgetown Fencing Club, which was a component of the Medieval Club before it split from the group to become a club sport. The two organizations are still connected and have overlapping members.
The cornerstone of the club’s programming is its Medieval Banquet, which features fencing, jugglers, dancers and a falconer to celebrate the Middle Ages.
As in past years, the banquet on April 13 in Copley Formal Lounge will feature free food, including a pig that will be roasted in Red Square. For some club members, this sight alone was an incentive to join the club.
“It has its tradition,” Jonathan Kim (COL ’12), senior adviser to the organization, said. “I joined the club after seeing the Medieval Banquet [which had] a pig roasting in Red Square. I’m a Medieval Studies major, so that also was a really good way for me to explore medieval culture as much as possible.”
Every fall, the Medieval Club travels to a local Renaissance fair and takes advantage of other cultural opportunities in the District. The group recently visited the National Geographic Museum’s “Anglo-Saxon Hoard: Gold from England’s Dark Ages” exhibit.
Medieval Club also hosts two to three movie nights each semester, occasionally accompanied by guest lecturers.
“In the past we’ve had a ‘Braveheart’ movie night where … Professor Jennifer Paxton in the history department [came] and [lectured] about ‘Braveheart’ and the inaccuracies of the movie,” Kim said.
The group has always been small, with active membership of around fifteen students.
“It’s been really hard to expand our membership. There’s this general idea that small clubs cater to [a small group of] people and their friends,” Radu said.
To draw in more students, club leaders hope to branch out and host more programs, possibly including a medieval cooking party in the future.

An anonymous donor has pledged $1 million to the Class of 2012 if more seniors contribute to their class fund than did so last year.
The Class of 2012 has until June 30, the end of the university’s fiscal year, to beat last year’s 68 percent participation rate.
Donations currently total $24,000, representing participation by 42 percent of the class.
In past years, more than 50 percent of seniors have donated to their class fund before graduation in mid-May.
Katie Eisenstein (COL ’12), chair of the Class of 2012 Fund, is optimistic about the project.
“I’m confident that we can meet our goal,” she said. “To put it in perspective, at this point last year the Class of 2011 Fund had 358 gifts and had raised around $8,300.”
The anonymous donor, a parent of a Georgetown student, allocated the potential gift to the 1789 Scholarship Imperative, which aims to fund 1,789 $25,000 scholarships by the end of the current 10-year capital campaign.
While not in contact with the donor, Eisenstein said that the gift was motivated by the current success of the Class of 2012 Fund. Statistics about the fund were shared with many alumni during the public launch of the capital campaign in October.
Georgetown’s Board of Regents, a group of alumni that acts as representatives of the university, has also pledged a donation to match the amount contributed by the senior class.
“This demonstrates that past generations are honoring our current philanthropy by amplifying it,”Eisenstein said. “This presents us with an exciting opportunity to make history as a class and truly give back to Georgetown.”

The Department of Health and Human Services finalized a set of federal regulations on Wednesday that will affect Georgetown and about 2,000 other colleges and universities that offer health insurance plans to students and employees.
The regulations, which will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2013, encompass a wide array of issues. Chief among them is a ban on excluding applicants from health plans based on pre-existing medical conditions. According to the new regulations, insurance companies must also adjust their profit margins for student plans.
In addition, the new regulations require schools to provide coverage of preventative care. This includes contraception, an issue that has stirred debate in recent months since a preliminary version of the policy was announced in late January.
University spokeswoman Stacy Kerr said that the university is monitoring the new regulations closely.
The announcement of these new federal regulations came as the Supreme Court began to hear oral arguments on the health care plan’s constitutionality Monday.
According to H*yas for Choice President Ashley Bradylyons (SFS ’12), several members of the group will be taking part in a Planned Parenthood Rally outside the Supreme Court Tuesday to show support for the act.

The 2012 Lannan Spring Symposium and Literary Festival, “Blueprint for Accountability,” will explore the 2008 financial crisis and resultant Occupy Wall Street movement with a series of discussions and speaker events.
“We believe the financial crisis to be one of our most pressing issues, and that our financial stability is still quite precarious,” Carolyn Forché, director of the Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Justice, the sponsor of the festival, said. “Undergraduates across the country should have a strong interest in this topic, as it affects everything from buying their first house to building their professional lives. I can’t think of anything that a college student should more intensely consume himself with.”
Former New York Gov. Elliot Spitzer, Rolling Stone Magazine contributor Matt Taibbi, Pulitzer-Prize winning author Ron Suskind, Occupy Wall Street activist and writer for the blog “Daily Kos” JesseLaGreca, Demos’ D.C. Office Director Heather McGhee and sustainability activist Van Jones will kick off the festival Tuesday with a panel about the relationship between Wall Street and the federal government. The event, co-sponsored by the Culture Project of New York City, aims to spark dialogueabout the role of financial and economic powers in American society.
Other events throughout the coming week include a breakfast conversation with Suskind and McGhee on Wednesday, a lecture by Booker Prize-winning author Margaret Atwood, a documentary screening and an event about the American debt crisis and Occupy movement.
Members of Georgetown Occupy have been consulted in the planning of the April 3 event, “American Occupations: Debt and the Crisis of Democracy.”
“Whether or not you agree with what the movement is, you have to acknowledge its major impact on national politics in the last year,” Georgetown Occupy member Gina Bull (SFS ’12) said. She added that she expects the national movement to make a spring resurgence and that this academic discussion marks a significant time for the Occupy protests.
Despite the national focus of the events, Forché emphasized the importance of the symposium to the Georgetown community.
“We’re always interested in opening conversations on campus among the disciplines and inspiringundergrads to become involved,” she said. “There are students all over our campus who are engaged in community service and are engaged in social justice.  My dream is a larger and greater conversation that facilitates understanding of the connections between the classroom and the community.”

D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray unrolled a $9.4 billion budget proposal for the fiscal year 2013 that contains no new taxes or fees but includes spending cuts and several initiatives to increase revenue.
The initiatives will aim to close the District’s $172.1 million budget deficit.
The mayor’s proposal, which was released Friday, includes a stipulation that would extend the number of hours permitted for alcohol sales in hopes of generating an extra $5.5 million.
If the budget is approved, bars would be able to remain open until 3 a.m. on weekdays and until 4 a.m. on weekends, and liquor stores would be allowed to open one hour earlier every day of the week.
The budget would also establish a “presidential inauguration week” in January of 2013 and 2017, during which bars could operate at weekend hours all week and restaurants could serve food 24 hours a day.
Other revenue-increasing proposals include traffic measures such as the installation of more speeding and red-light cameras, expected to generate $24.8 million, and changes to the tax code, anticipated to net an additional $28.2 million.
All told, the additional revenue will amount to $69.4 million, or a little over a third of the district’s current budget deficit.
The rest of the deficit will be addressed with $103 million in spending cuts, largely to health care coverage. The largest single cut would be $23 million from the D.C. Healthcare Alliance Program, which provides health care coverage to low-income residents.
“We had to make difficult choices, but we believe this budget maintains the right level of government services, including protecting our most vulnerable citizens, without raising taxes,” Gray said in a statement.
The announcement of the mayor’s budget is the first step in an often-prolonged process involving both the D.C. Council and the federal government.
On Tuesday, the mayor, the district’s chief financial officer, the city administrator and the budget director will testify before the council, which is set to vote on the budget May 15.
After the budget is approved by the council, it must be submitted to Congress for review as part of the federal budget process. This has been problematic in past years; last April, the District was on the verge of a municipal shutdown due to delays in the approval process before Congress came to an11th hour agreement.
According to Georgetown’s Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming, the possibility of a federal shutdown — and therefore a municipal shutdown for the District — is not unlikely.
“Right now … the Senate and the House of Representatives are dealing with two different sets of numbers in terms of overall spending,” he said, referring to the fact that two very different appropriations bills are being considered by the two chambers. “It will be challenging at best to find agreement and …  there is a risk that [a shutdown] could occur.”

Student Association senate voted unanimously to approve its budget for fiscal year 2013 and nominations for a new executive cabinet.
President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and Vice President Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) created three new positions in their cabinet — secretaries of social justice, campus ministry and academic affairs. They did not retain the positions of secretary of career services, secretary of information and technology, secretary of strategic development and director of executive outreach, making this year’s cabinet one seat smaller than the last.
Scott Stirrett (SFS ’13), co-founder and former chair of D.C. Students Speak, will serve as secretary of neighborhood relations.
“Our relationship with the neighborhood has been tense in the past, but it doesn’t mean it has to be that way in the future,” he said. “We look forward to reaching out on a one-on-one basis to establish personal relationships.”
According to Stirrett, members of the cabinet will meet with Center for Student Programs Director ErikaCohen-Derr about the possibility of registering incoming freshmen to vote in the District during the New Student Orientation.
Jon Askonas (SFS ’13), co-chair of the Walsh Exchange Steering Committee, a new intercollegiate international relations conference to be held at Georgetown, will serve as secretary of academic affairs. The position was created to assist the development of an undergraduate academic research symposium. According to Askonas, the goals of the position also include making professor evaluations more accessible to students and reviewing academic policies.
To achieve the latter goal, Askonas plans to establish a relationship between GUSA and the Inter-School Academic Council.
“Right now, the academic policies are fragmented by school. We want to work on making the policies accessible to students on [a] university-wide level,” he said.
Laura West (COL ’13), who will serve as secretary of mission and ministry, plans to work closely with the Interfaith Council and both religious and non-religious groups on campus.
“We will reach out to them to let them know GUSA will support them within our capacity and get a clearer direction of what our role should be,” she said.
West’s immediate goals include supporting religious retreats and continuing the university’s participation in President Obama’s Interfaith and Community Service Campus Challenge, which began in September.
The other appointments include Amanda Kimbers (MSB ’13) as secretary of athletic affairs, JamesSaucedo (MSB ’13) as secretary of diversity affairs, Sophie Guntram (COL ’13) as secretary of student safety, Erin Auel (COL ’14) as secretary of sustainability, Nanase Matsushita (SFS ’13) as secretary of treasury and Neesha Tambe (COL ’13) as secretary of social justice. John Morris (COL ’13) and Sam Schneider (COL ’13), a member of The Hoya’s board of directors, will serve as student advocates general.
The fiscal year 2013 budget, which also passed unanimously, was drafted by the Finance and Appropriations Committee in early March and allocates $960,000 to campus groups. The budget marks a $160,000 increase in available funds from fiscal year 2012 and will fulfill 64 percent of requests submitted by student organizations.
The senate also passed the Omnibus Electoral Accountability and Regulation Act, which clarifies campaigning rules. According to the bill, the GUSA Election Commission must now publish complaints recorded against candidates, and candidates are required to report the cost of creating their websites if they are developed by anyone other than a Georgetown undergraduate.

The $1 million donated by Board of Directors Chairman Paul Tagliabue (CAS ’62) and his wife Chandler to the LGBTQ Resource Center in October will soon become available to its staff.
The donation must be invested and processed fully by the Office of Financial Affairs before funds become accessible. This process usually takes a minimum of four to six months, according to Center Director Sivagami Subbaraman.
The Tagliabue Initiative for LGBTQ Life: Fostering Formation and Transformation, a portion of the Tagliabues’ $5 million donation to the university as part of the current capital campaign, will be distributed to the center in increments of $40,000 to $50,000 a month. Subbaraman plans to set up an advisory group of faculty, students, staff and alumni to govern the use of the donation.
“When the money does become available to us … the advisory committee and myself will have to think of the most thoughtful way to use the money for the betterment of LGBTQ life on campus through the years,” she said.
The Tagliabues will also be involved in decisions about how to use the money, which Subbaraman hopes will increase funding for speakers, events, workshops and student groups.
Tagliabue, a former commissioner of the National Football League and the father of an openly gay son, intends to increase collaboration among the center, the athletic department and students’ parents, according to Subbaraman.
Michael Deneen (COL ’14), a student employee of the center, hopes to use the money to bolster LGTBQ-focused programming.
“I’m looking forward to the money allowing for a wider base of student involvement. Not only students involved in LGTBQ life, but allies and other interested participants, will hopefully be able to help us to cement a larger presence on campus,” he said.

For some women on campus, the inauguration of Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) as the GUSA executive signaled a new era of student leadership at Georgetown.
Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount comprise the first all-female ticket to be elected to lead the Georgetown University Student Association.
Women have recently made strides in campus leadership, but statistically, a gender imbalance persists within the university’s highest profile organizations.
Though women make up a slight majority on campus, four of GUSA’s 16 senators, two of Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union’s seven board of directors members, two of the seven Students of Georgetown, Inc.’s board of directors and four of the 11 members of The Corp’s upper management are female.
While the degree to which these female leaders feel that gender discrepancies are a problem varies, many say they have faced obstacles on the way to their current positions.
“Women frequently fare worse in terms of being taken on for a leadership position,” the International Relations Club Director of Communications Emily Siegler (SFS ’14) said. Four of the 10 executive board members of the IRC, which is one of Georgetown’s largest student organizations, are female.
“Women do not possess the same credibility as do men when it comes to leading,” Siegler said.
For Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount, the idea of an old boys club has historically come across particularly strongly within GUSA. The last female GUSA president before Gustafson was Kelley Hampton (SFS ’05), elected in the spring of 2004.
“While there isn’t necessarily a culture of male domination at Georgetown, there is a history of male domination in GUSA,” Kohnert-Yount, former chair of the Georgetown University College Democrats, said.
She noted that this was particularly clear during elections, when she felt that female candidates were more heavily judged on their appearance than their male counterparts. Gustafson and Kohnert-Yountwere wary about identifying as the all-female ticket, because they did not want their gender to take away from their platform.
“There are different social standards for men and women [who] decide to run for office,” Kohnert-Yount said.
Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount’s executive branch is comprised of 11 women and 13 males. That of their predecessors, Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) and Greg Laverriere (COL ’12), was made up of four females and 22 males.
According to Stephanie Kuo (MSB ’13), executive secretary in Meaney and Laverriere’s staff, female underrepresentation in leadership positions is not just a GUSA or Georgetown phenomenon.
“In past years, it’s been sort of a systemic issue. Even if you look at the U.S. Congress, women are underrepresented. … There is room for improvement, but we’ve made great strides,” she said.
Kuo began her role coordinating the schedules and communication for the GUSA executive cabinet and staff but became increasingly involved in important decisions throughout her term.
Georgetown University College Republicans Chair Maggie Cleary (COL ’14), one of five females among the club’s 11 officers, says that the larger proportion of males in certain groups at Georgetown might be explained by differing preferences between men and women.
“A lot of activities that I am involved with seem to be very male dominated, and I think that is simply because girls aren’t interested in some of these topics,” she said.
According to Heather Seamans (COL ’12), co-president of Georgetown’s chapter of Republican Women, her organization was founded to foster a more moderate political discourse within the Republican party. Seamans stressed, however, that the group does not identify women’s issues as its focus, instead exploring topics including immigration reform and gay rights.
Seamans said that she feels women are well represented in campus leadership positions overall, arguing that the election of Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount was the continuation of progress that female leaders have made at Georgetown over the past year.
Current GUSA Director of Communications KaraBrandeisky (COL ’13) believes that a large part of Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount’s election success can be attributed to targeting students who have been historically underrepresented in GUSA, namely women.
In contrast, female leaders in GUASFCU and The Corp did not report feeling like a minority in their respective student organizations.
According to Chief Lending Officer Catie Barile (MSB ’13) and Chief Communications Officer Mary Bryan Ciarrocchi(MSB ’13), the ratio of male-to-female leadership inGUASFCU’s board of directors fluctuates but does not affect the culture of the institution.
“Every year the composition of the GUASFCU board is different,” Ciarrocchi wrote in an email. “We have seen past boards in which males have been the majority, and we have also seen past boards in which females have been the majority.”
While last year The Corp held information sessions to specifically encourage female students to apply for its board of directors and upper management, the representation of males and females is well-balanced, according to Chief Operating Officer Stephanie Wolfram (MSB ’13).
Outside of student organizations, Kuo noted that many female students serve as leaders in high-level positions within the boards that govern the university and alumni network. Kuo has previously served as a student representative to the board of directors.
“It’s not gender that defines us but shared passions and visions,” Kuo said. “At the end of the day, that’s the most important factor in our successes.”
Brandeisky also thinks that more women will move into leadership positions if a precedent of female involvement is set.
“Older female students encouraged me to pursue leadership positions when I was a freshman,” she said. “Early on, this made a big difference.”
Kuo agreed that it is important to provide women at Georgetown with mentorship and an example of female leadership.
“It’s on us to foster women in engagement and be great advocates for reaching out to more women,” she said.

The Shops at Georgetown Park are set to undergo substantial interior renovations, including the demolition of the entire ground floor of the building.
Vornado Realty Trust and Angelo Gordon & Co., the mall’s owners, received permits from the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs this month allowing them to begin renovating the space.
The permits allow for interior non-structural demolition on the Canal, Wisconsin and M Street levels of the mall, as well as renovations to the lower, middle and upper levels of the parking garage. Only the topmost level of the mall will remain untouched.
Though work can start almost immediately according toDCRA spokesperson Helder Gil, there is no clear timeline for the renovations.
“They haven’t submitted permits yet for what they are planning on rebuilding in the space. That’s not something I think we know at this point,” he said.
Mitchell Shear, president of Vornado, had previously discussed the possibility of converting the many smaller spaces on the ground floor into fewer, larger stores.
“It’ll end up as a prime, large-format, street-driven retail mall with seven to a dozen stores as opposed to 60 or 80,” Shear told the Washington Business Journal in February.
The company has not applied for any permits to modify the exterior of the building. These permits are more difficult to obtain, as exterior renovations require approval from both the Citizens Association of Georgetown and the Commission of Fine Arts.
Only 12 stores remain open in the Shops at Georgetown Park, which once held more than 60 shops and businesses.
According to Robert Bellamy, assistant general manager at Washington Sports Club, the business has not been asked to leave the mall. WSC is located on the top level of the building, which is not slated for renovation.
“It will be open while things are under construction, while they’re making renovations,” Bellamy said.
Bellamy added that the arrival of a large department store would be good for the remaining businesses. Although WSC has not seen a decline in customers, Bellamy said, “It never hurts to have more awareness,” citing that a large store would increase traffic in the mall.
Since being forced to vacate the mall in Dec. 2011, several former occupants, including FornashDesigns and Total Party, have announced the opening of new locations across the Potomac atBallston Common Mall in Arlington, Va.
