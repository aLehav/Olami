After expanding to New York and Boston this year, Sweetgreen has again raised its national profile. Founded by two Georgetown alumni in 2007, the salad chain will receive a $22 million investment from venture capital firm Revolution Growth, the firm announced Wednesday.
Revolution Growth, also based in Washington D.C. and founded by former AOL Time Warner Chairman Steve Case, former Exclusive Resorts CEO Donn Davis and Monumental Sports & Entertainment founder, Chairman and Majority Owner Ted Leonsis (CAS ’77), has thus far concentrated its investments in the tech industry, investing in startups such as Living Social and Zipcar. Sweetgreen marks Revolution Growth’s first investment in the restaurant industry.
Nicolas Jammet (MSB ’07), Jonathan Neman (MSB ’07) and Nathaniel Ru (MSB ’07) opened their first location on M Street in Georgetown shortly after graduating. Two years later in 2009, the trio opened a location in Dupont Circle before quickly expanding up the eastern seaboard; Sweetgreen now operates 22 storefronts.
“Nic, Jonathan and Nate have developed an iconic brand in an industry that is ripe for disruption,” Case wrote in an email to The Hoya.
With funding from Revolution Growth, Sweetgreen will focus on a three-pronged approach to the restaurant’s current team and structure as well as expansion.
“One is to invest in our people, so really invest in building a great team, invest in the culture, invest in training, really build the capabilities of a great company,” Neman told The Hoya. “The second is to invest in our community, to amp up our community efforts. And lastly we are going to expand Sweetgreen, not aggressively but I would say very consciously, both in the markets we are in as well as new markets.”
Case hopes Sweetgreen will become a model for quick dining beyond traditional fast food restaurants. The restaurant uses locally grown ingredients for most items on its menu and sells cold-press juices and frozen yogurt in addition to salad.
“We believe it has the potential to penetrate markets in every city across the country, building community and redefining how people eat, what they eat and what they should expect from fast-casual dining,” Case wrote. “The fast-casual restaurant market is the largest growing segment of the $435 billion restaurant industry, so the possibilities are really endless for the company’s growth.”
Neman shared Case’s optimism, putting forth his expansive long-term and short-term goals for the company’s growth.
“Our vision is to one day be the world’s number one healthy lifestyle brand, but for the near future, it’s to really focus on being the best healthy fast-food company in the country,” Neman said.
The Sweetgreen founders decided to accept Revolution Growth’s investment because of their belief in the two companies’ compatibility.
“We really share a lot of values; they have core values that we believe in, they really believe in our overall mission,” Neman said. “Their whole philosophy is to invest in businesses that will change the world for the better.”
According to technology blog TechCrunch, Case will join the Sweetgreen board and advise Jammet, Neman and Ru.
Neman emphasized that the funding will not affect the company’s values but rather allow it to continue to further develop its sustainable business model.
“The plan is not to go into hyper-growth mode — it’s still to take our time and to do things right and consciously,” Neman said.
Moving forward, the quality of Sweetgreen’s local, sustainable and organic ingredients as well as the brand’s focus on creating an experience sets Sweetgreen apart from other restaurants, according to Neman.
“The biggest difference when you go to Sweetgreen is it’s not just the transaction — we create an emotional connection with our customers and connect with each individual,” Neman said.

The Initiative on Catholic Social Thought held its second dialogue focusing on poverty under the Pontificate of Pope Francis Monday night in Gaston Hall.
The event, “The Pope and the Poor: Challenges of Pope Francis and Catholic Social Thought for American Poverty,” featured Washington Post columnists E.J. Dionne and Michael Gerson, National Review Online Editor-at-Large Kathryn Jean Lopez and Stephen Blaire, the bishop of Stockton, Calif.
The initiative, led by Director John Carr, stemmed from an idea from the Office of University President John J. DeGioia that aims to advance Catholic social teaching in relation to current political, social and economic issues, with the intent to promote the common good.
Speakers asserted Pope Francis is unique in his approach to remediating the challenges of the poor because he is willing to challenge Church convention by emphasizing tenets long ignored.
“The reason that Francis is so powerful and attractive is that he talks like Jesus and acts like Jesus,”Gerson said. “A Church that looked like this could transform the world.”
Conversely, other speakers asserted that the strength of Pope Francis’ approach to poverty does not lie in his strategy, but in the simplicity with which he communicates the problems of the poor.
“Pope Francis is speaking the Gospel in a common language that we can understand,” Blaire said. “He is speaking as a pastor who has been on the streets with his people in Buenos Aires.”
Panelists acknowledged the pope’s dissemination of message through comparatively modern methods, such as interviews with secular journalists, daily homilies and televised acts of charity and compassion.
The panelists also discussed the pope’s call for Catholics to take action against the injustice of poverty in society.
“Catholics all too often do not show lives that are different and conform to the Gospel,” Lopez said. “But if the pope can find time for other people, so can you.”
The speakers also mentioned the implications of the pope’s message, as Pope Francis has emphasized the need for unity between Catholics of both major American political parties in order to ably combat this problem.
Students in attendance felt the discussion caused them to reflect on their own roles in combating poverty and in the church.
“I was motivated to follow the role that Francis gives the Church when he said, ‘I prefer a church which is bruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets, rather than a church which is unhealthy from being confined and from clinging to its own security,’” Patrick Denenea (COL ’17) said.

Mayor Vincent Gray officially announced his bid for re-election Monday after picking up his Petition for Candidacy at the D.C. Board of Elections office, altering a previously wide-open race populated with a number of qualified candidates.
Gray’s announcement has shifted the focus of the race, as candidates are now tasked with unseating an incumbent embattled with legal troubles surrounding allegations of illegal donations to the mayor’s 2010 campaign.
The mayor will likely center his campaign on his successful push for District budget autonomy in light of federal budget cuts, in addition to the economic progress the city has made during his term.
Soon after Gray’s announcement, some candidates took the opportunity to highlight the incumbent’s perceived ethical shortcomings.
“I think it really sharpens the discussion about integrity in government,” Councilmember Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6) said to The Hoya, referring to Gray’s legal troubles during his election campaign.
Councilmember Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4) was also critical of the mayor’s refusal to answer questions stemming from his 2010 campaign.
“[Gray] will have to end his silence and answer the many legal questions about his 2010 campaign,” Bowser said in an email to her supporters following Gray’s announcement.
Mayoral candidate and former State Department official Reta Jo Lewis said that Gray’s decision to run should serve as a reminder to voters of the importance of this race.
“This news simply reinforces the choice facing the people of our city. The mayor and the other four members of the D.C. Council who are running for mayor are part of the status quo,” Lewis said. “I’m the only candidate who is not a politician, and the only candidate who will provide a fresh start and bring a new, inclusive approach to the Wilson Building, the executive office of the D.C. mayor.
As for Gray, he will not be answering any additional questions regarding allegations stemming from his 2010 campaign. Instead, he is focusing on the economic and social gains his administration has made during his current term.
“Look, our record speaks for itself. Look at the fiscal stability in this city, look at the economic development in this city, the educational improvements, the way people are getting back to work,” Gray told a group of reporters Tuesday. “I want to talk about the future of the District of Columbia.”
Candidate and Busboys and Poets owner Andy Shallal painted Gray’s announcement as inconsequential to the focus of his campaign.
“I don’t think it changes much from my perspective; you have another person from City Hall running,” Shallal said. “I see it as business as usual.”
Other mayoral candidates took a less aggressive tone toward Gray’s announcement, welcoming him to a competitive race.
“Welcome to the race,” Councilmember Vincent Orange (D-At Large) said in an interview Tuesday. “I look forward to the dialogue.”
Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) declined to comment on the matter.
While Gray has until Jan. 2, 2014, to gather the 2,000 signatures necessary to enter the Democratic primary on April 1, the Mayor has already tapped longtime D.C. political operative Chuck Thies to run his campaign.
Gray sent an email to supporters urging them to sign petitions supporting his candidacy but said he will hold off on launching his campaign until after the New Year.
“We will formally launch ‘Gray 2014’ next year,” Gray wrote. “This is not the season when people want to hear from politicians. Now is the time for family, friends and celebration.”

No Georgetown students won Rhodes, Marshall or Mitchell fellowships during this year’s application cycle, the results of which were announced throughout the past two weeks.
Between 2001 and 2010, four Georgetown students have won Rhodes scholarships, seven have won Marshall scholarships and nine have been awarded Mitchell scholarships, according to the Georgetown Office of Fellowships, Awards and Research.
The last Rhodes fellowship won by a Georgetown student was awarded to Stephanie Bryson, a former SFS grad student in 2011. Shea Houlihan (SFS ’13) and Benjamin Buchanan (COL ’11, GRAD ’13) won Marshall scholarships and Wardah Athar (COL ’13) won a Mitchell fellowship last year.
In total, 23 Georgetown students have won the Rhodes scholarship between 1903 and 2013, according to the program’s website. Georgetown has had a total of 21 students win the Marshall Scholarship for two years of post-graduate study in the United Kingdom and 14 win the Mitchell Scholarship for post-graduate study in Ireland.
GOFAR administrators, however, do not view this year’s results as an impediment to future students’ ambitions.
“This is certainly not a setback given the rarity of these fellowships,” GOFAR Director John Glavinwrote in an email. “Fellowship winners are the academic equivalent of Olympic medalists.”
Six Harvard University students won Rhodes scholarships this year, more than at any other institution. It was followed by Yale and Stanford, which each had three Rhodes scholars. Director of Fellowships Lauren Tuckley suggested that the rarity of fellowships awarded could be affected by the low number of Georgetown students who apply.
“It helps to understand when one sees that significantly smaller than 1 percent of a class is interested in applying,” she said in an email. “Georgetown will only grow its chances of winning fellowships when more students are interested in competing.”
This year, the committee of faculty administrators and former fellowship winners that recommends students to fellowship committees endorsed nine of the 16 alumni and seniors that applied. The process consisted of applying for university endorsement during the spring of students’ junior years, then interviewing skills over the next few months before the fellowships’ deadlines in October.
GOFAR holds six weeks of mock interviews from October to November that provide feedback and coaching tips on topics ranging from academic reasoning to body language and intonation.
“I felt that I was very well prepared, that the office gives each of us a lot of time and support as we develop our applications and as we prepare for the interviews,” said Andrew Choi (SFS ’14), a finalist for the Rhodes scholarship whose research focuses on energy and paper-based batteries.
Regardless of the outcome, applicants said they believed the process of applying was rewarding and allowed them to develop their academic ambitions.
“I think it was definitely helpful for me personally, to help me to clarify exactly what I wanted to do and study,” said Aamir Hussain (COL ’14), who applied for the Rhodes and Marshall scholarships to examine the use of interfaith dialogue in improving healthcare.
Students noted that GOFAR gave them a consistent amount of support, even after decisions had been made.
“Throughout the process I developed a network and the school professors helped me to prepare for the interview,” Choi said.
Choi expressed the hope that other students will consider applying for these scholarships.
“One thing I would say though is to encourage more people to apply,” Choi said, “I don’t think Georgetown gets enough applicants to apply to the Office of Fellowships and one thing I hope to do is encourage talented sophomores and juniors to start considering to apply and start talking to them.”
Although the Rhodes and Marshall fellowships have completed their application cycles for this year, other opportunities such as the James Madison Memorial Fellowship, the Thomas R. Pickering Fellowship Program and the NIH-Cambridge Scholars Program are still accepting applications.

Epicurean and Company owner Chang Wook Chon has pledged to uphold the university’s Just Employment Policy but has not agreed to change his business practices in response to a petition delivered by student representatives Nov. 11 protesting the treatment of his employees.
“It’s not something I have to change because of the petition or the demonstration,” Chon said. “But we’ve been doing what we are supposed to do to comply with the Just Employment Policy.”
Chon was charged in 2010 with withholding overtime wages from workers and violating the Fair Labor Standards Act. He pled guilty in March to criminal contempt for violating a court order that was issued during a civil lawsuit. The complaints stemmed from practices at Chon’s Connecticut Avenue establishment, which is not beholden to the JEP.
The petition, delivered by a 40-student group led by representatives from the Georgetown University Student Association, the Georgetown Solidarity Committee and Hoyas for Immigrant Rights, sought to bring attention to Chon’s alleged mistreatment of Epicurean workers, expressing “great concern regarding allegations of wage theft, intimidation and the mistreatment of immigrant workers at Epicurean.”
The document called for Chon to publically reaffirm his commitment to the policy, a framework designed to ensure fair wages and access to certain university resources. Additionally, the petition requested that Chon fully cooperate with the efforts of the university administration to ensure transparent and fair business practices.
“I have taken many steps to show my commitment to Epicurean employees, to Georgetown University and to the Just Employment Policy,” Chon wrote in a letter addressed to the Georgetown community Nov. 18. “I will continue to work with the associate vice president of auxiliary services and the greater Georgetown University administration on the Just Employment policy.”
Chon restated his commitment to fair treatment of employees, stating that continued adherence to the JEP guidelines is a required condition of his business practice.
“Right now in this location, it’s mandatory, and I have to do it. We’ve been doing what we are supposed to do to comply with the Just Employment Policy,” Chon told The Hoya. “I am aware of it, so I followed it from day one when I started this business.”
According to GSC member Irene Koo (COL ’16), however, Chon’s treatment of employees on the Georgetown campus did not always adhere to the JEP.
“We were really concerned about the fact that workers on our own campus were being mistreated. We had no way of making sure that the abuses had stopped or that the university could effectively enforce the JEP based on the existing contract,” Koo said. “I don’t agree with his statement that he has complied with the JEP ‘from day one’ because it is clear that in the past, many of his employees had grievances about withheld wages, threats and intimidation.”
Assistant Vice President of Auxiliary Services Joelle Wiese also affirmed that the university has not directly undertaken any new policies towards Epicurean as a result of the student protest against Chon’s treatment of his staff.
“I don’t know if there have been any direct effects of the petition other than a lot of communication back and forth,” Wiese said.
However, she noted that over the past several months, the university has undertaken broader measures to make sure campus businesses are complying with the JEP, although not all efforts have been widely publicized.
Wiese pointed to a compliance hotline, the use of employee surveys, financial audits, town hall-style meetings between workers and administrators and a video outlining the various facets of the JEP to Epicurean workers as parts of a larger effort to include workers in the greater campus community.
GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) described the pace of implementing new university policies in response to the petition and protest as sluggish, saying that student activism is playing a role in making the university a better place for employees.
“It’s been a really great opportunity for [Chon] to publicly commit, which is what we’re asking for,” Tisa said. “Going back to the original petition, we wanted to open up that dialogue and then prove that students are watching, and students are caring about these members of our community.”
Wiese stated that the ultimate goal of any changes to university policy should be to find new ways of supporting the workers.
“Going forward with the Just Employment, we’re coming up with new ways that we can actually ensure compliance,” Wiese said. “That’s one of the ways Georgetown is reaching out to the contracted employees in general, to help make them feel part of the family.”

“Having an academic advisor who acts really surprised when you excel in your classes.”
“When everyone looks at you when the word ‘slavery’ is brought up in discussion.”
“No black hairdressers on this side of town. So you have to trek 30-plus minutes.”
“Having to defend why I am part of student organizations that are predominately white.”
“Being asked to speak for your whole race in an article for The Hoya.”
These tweets, from Shavonnia Corbin-Johnson (SFS ’14), Raquel Caldwell (COL ’16), Kendra Tonette(NHS ’13), Jimmy Ramirez (COL ’15) and Aya Waller-Bey (COL ’14), respectively, were all accompanied by the hashtag #BBGU, short for “being black at Georgetown University,” yesterday. The hashtag was part of a Twitter protest held by the Black House between 11 a.m. and 11 p.m. Thursday, during which students, alumni, faculty and administrators discussed the experience many students of color encounter on campus.
A similar event at the University of Michigan, #BBUM, inspired the Black House’s effort, which Waller-Bey, who is the Black House resident director, organized.
“I wanted to bring that conversation to Georgetown, and I really wanted us to have an outlet to often speak out,” Waller-Bey said.
Students tweeted about racism they have encountered on campus, prejudice in the classroom, uninformed conversations and daily inconveniences — like other students asking to touch black students’ hair — along with the sense of community among organizations like the Black Students Association and the Georgetown chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
“I just wish, you know, the greater Georgetown community can really see… how we feel when someone asks if they can touch our hair,” Waller-Bey told The Hoya.
“If you do something racist or say something racist, and you say ‘I’m so sorry I didn’t know that was offensive, I didn’t know that was racist,’ that doesn’t change the impact that it has,” she added.
Many of the grievances expressed by the student participants revolved around Georgetown’s deficiency of diversity programs, specifically in its lack of a formalized African-American studies department and major and the absence of a diversity requirement for students.
“If Georgetown could really find a way to pull into action and streamline a diversity requirement, have a mandatory experience where students are kind of able to engage in a conversation, I think that would be valuable,” Waller-Bey said.
She said that she hopes that #BBGU will help raise awareness about these issues in the Georgetown community and encourage the administration to become more involved in diversity issues on campus.
“I want Georgetown, the provost and [University President John J. DeGioia] to say ‘We hear you.’”Waller-Bey said. “And I want them to formally say that ‘We hear what you’re saying. We think these are problems. We are going to do whatever we can to make Georgetown more inclusive of all communities, all unrepresented communities.’”
The Georgetown administration gave #BBGU its full support, endorsing the event in a post from the official Georgetown Facebook page, with many individual administrators also joining in the conversation from their personal Twitter accounts.
“Check out #BBGU — An important conversation — voices of students, alumni, faculty, and staff – we all need to listen and engage,” Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson tweeted.
“#BBGU: a powerful reminder that acknowledging privilege and striving for justice is a lifelong endeavor. Never over,” Center for Student Engagement Director Erika Cohen Derr tweeted.
Despite these administrators’ support of the event, Waller-Bey said that university officials have a responsibility to do more.
“I think Georgetown needs to step up,” she said. “These things cannot keep happening. We should have to feel comfortable. I shouldn’t have to feel like I’m on a battlefield.”
Waller-Bey emphasized the importance of holding an event like #BBGU in order to support a sense of community.
“For everyone to be able to partake in this, and for people to give the affirmation to feel like, ‘You are not alone. I’ve experienced this,’” Waller-Bey said. “I really enjoy by having this open forum where you actually can retweet this and say ‘Yes, I understand, I agree, that’s been my experience.’”
Even though many of the posted tweets described negative experiences, Waller-Bey stressed that her intentions for the event are rooted in her love for the university.
“This was organized because we love Georgetown, and because I love Georgetown,” she said. “And the students here really care the experiences of themselves and the experiences of others, and they really want to create an outlet for people to share, you know, their stories and their narratives.”
Waller-Bey hoped that this event will serve as a catalyst for more thoughtful discussion about race on campus that could lead to increase sensitivity and respect.
“I love Georgetown. … Because of that, I challenge it to be a better Georgetown so people behind me can have a better experience,” she said.

The Office of Sustainability and the Freshmen Sustainability Council have worked to introduce 10 water refilling stations next semester.
The Freshmen Sustainability Council, an arm of the Georgetown University Student Association Freshmen Outreach Program, focused on water refilling stations to freshmen dorm lobbies. Darnall, Harbin and New South Halls will each receive a station, but Village C West will not, due to the building’s outdated piping and tendency to flood.
“That was a surefire thing. I know personally, that I would appreciate being able to make a stop on the way to Yates or before going to class,” Freshmen Sustainability Council Chair Olivia Hinerfeld (SFS ’17) said.
The council will make formal recommendations on possible locations for additional water refilling station sites including Car Barn, Walsh and White-Gravenor. The new Healey Family Student Center will also include at least 10 planned hydration systems.
“The rest, which are going around campus, are going to be basically where we think they’re going to get the most use, the most foot traffic, just any way possible to give as many people the opportunity to reuse a water bottle,” council member Willie Landi (COL ’17) said. “We just want to make sure everybody knows they’re available because I think it’s really important that people are aware of resources they have.”
Landi added that the council is considering using QR codes and an online map to advertise the new stations.
Putting the water refilling stations in place has been a collaborative effort between the Office of Sustainability and the Freshmen Sustainability Council. The successful partnership has been a byproduct of the Sustainability Council’s desire to be as communicative as possible with other groups on campus.
“We approached the Office of Sustainability, and they said, ‘Yes, we’re totally on board. We already have this budgeted. We just haven’t put in it into motion, so can you help us put this into motion?’”Hinerfeld said.
“I think just going into the year with that kind of mindset of working as more of a coalition has made the whole process…quite streamlined,” Hinerfeld said.
The water refilling station project marks an ongoing effort between staff and students to create a more sustainable campus.
“This effort is part of an ongoing ‘Think Global, Drink Local’ initiative spearheaded by the Office of Sustainability and our partners across campus to help reduce waste from disposable bottled water by providing convenient access to filtered tap water,” Office of Sustainability Director Audrey Stewart wrote in an email.

Recent graduate Jeff Stefanis (MSB ’13) is revolutionizing the way Washington residents get around their city by introducing Riide, a company that that will sell moderately priced electric bikes that double as bicycles.
“We saw an opportunity, and we decided to make our own electric bike, specifically designed for young urban commuters, as a quicker and less expensive way to get around the cities,” Stefanis said. “What we’re really excited about our bike is that it’s a relatively light bike that maintains the traditional feeling of riding a bicycle.”
The startup will begin fundraising on Kickstarter next week. The page will provide a description of the bike andRiide’s goals.
Stefanis drew inspiration for Riide, cofounded with The George Washington University graduate Amber Wason, after witnessing the proliferation of electric bikes in China.
The electric bike, priced at $1,799, can travel up to 20 miles per hour thanks to a four-pound battery located inside the frame of the bike. The battery lasts about 20 to 25 miles per charge and can be charged at any wall socket in about two to three hours.
Stefanis plans to cater to the District but has hopes to integrate with the Georgetown community, as Georgetown and the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative have been assets to Stefanis andRiide’s conception.
The Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative has been instrumental in the support and development of Riide. The program exposed Stefanis to courses and mentors, in addition to providing seed money for opportunities to pitch business ideas.
“Jeff is the kind of guy you want to root for, and his passion for transforming urban transportation is palpable. I predict that Riide will be very successful,” Jeff Reid, the founding director of the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative, said. “He is using the power of entrepreneurship to create meaningful change in American cities and help alleviate problems such as pollution and traffic congestion.”
For students, Riide will be a useful alternative to the limited public transportation in the D.C. area.
“I think it’s a really good idea, especially because public transportation is really crowded and somewhat unreliable,” Alex Garvey (MSB ’17) said. “I think that if I lived in D.C., I probably wouldn’t want a car just because it would be a big hassle, and I would probably take public transportation, but if there were the bike option, I would definitely consider it.”
Despite the possible utility of Riide, the price of the bicycles remains an important consideration for students on a budget.
“Cost is a big factor. As an urban youth, I may not be able to afford an electric bicycle,” Matt Hinson(SFS ’17) said.
According to Sustainability Fellow Greg Miller (SFS ’14), the option of Riide gives students familiarity with bicycling, thus making the mode of transportation more attractive.
“More and more people are going to ride bikes versus take other forms of transportation cause it really is mostly about convenience and easy access,” Miller said. “[D.C.] is a really bicycle-friendly city; there are a lot of routes for cyclists.”
Ultimately, Riide aims to change the convenience and efficiency of public transportation in cities.
“We really think that electric bikes are not only the quickest way to get around a city, but also the least expensive and most efficient way,” Stefanis said. “We hope to change the way people think about transportation.”

College Democrats and College Republicans will transition their leadership in the coming days, with Chandini Jha (COL ’16) and Patrick Musgrave (COL ’16) winning the chair positions, respectively.
Musgrave, elected Tuesday, ran uncontested and will take over for outgoing chair Alex Cave (COL ’15).
“I was just lucky enough that no one else wanted to throw their hat in the ring,” Musgrave said.
Jha’s election, which took place Nov. 19, was contested, as Kyle Rice (SFS ’16) also ran for the chair position.
Outgoing GUCD Chair Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) had also run a contested race, against two other candidates. He said there has been an increase in competition since he joined GUCD his freshman year, which he characterizes as a good omen for the club.
“I think that says a lot about our club and the desire to kind of take on a true leadership role within it. It shows we’re an organization that’s important to our members,” he said.
While both the GUCR chair and vice chair positions were uncontested, other positions within the club saw increased competition.
“It was a really great election because we had a lot of people running — some spots had like five people running for them — and I think they were the most contested elections in GUCR history,” Musgrave said.
Musgrave interpreted this heightened interest as indicative of the evolving political makeup of campus.
“Campus is more Republican than one may think, but definitely I think that the Democrats are more active and vocal, and a lot of people when they think politics at Georgetown, they think liberal Democratic politics,” Musgrave said. “And I think this is a good sign that the conservative, and especially conservative young people, are gaining a following on campus.”
GUCD’s elections, unlike GUCR’s, take place online via HoyaLink, which Jha said was more efficient and manageable. The campaigns also took on a distinct online presence this year, particularly on Facebook, but not at the expense of face-to-face time with the candidates. Jha held office hours on the second floor of Lauinger Library to allow members to address concerns and provide suggestions.
“When we have more people, there will be even more people contesting elections next year, so we’ll need to go to HoyaLink elections,” Musgrave said. “That was a good idea that the Dems had.”
Musgrave said that another one of his goals for the term is to further improve GUCR’s relationship with the College Democrats. The two clubs already collaborate on the freshman debate, which is sponsored by College Republicans, College Democrats and Hoyas for Liberty.
“We had [the debate] this semester, and it went very well, as it always does,” Musgrave said.
Jha also said she looks forward to strengthening the clubs’ relationship in the future.
“There are common goals that we have to get people involved in the political process regardless of where their ideology puts them,” Jha said.
Tezel said that GUCD fostered cooperation with GUCR during his term by holding events for the two clubs. However, he said the key to inter-club cooperation was also fostering a personal relationship between the chairs.
Musgrave and Jha will be sitting down in a meeting with outgoing chairs Tezel and Cave, who could not be reached for comment, to discuss the upcoming year, a customary practice that has been happening for years.
“Chandini is going to run a great organization,” Musgrave said. “I’d like to think my organization is going to be very well run too. So I think we’re going to have a very good year of GUCR and GUCD relations.”

The world came to a collective pause Thursday to mourn the death of human rights leader Nelson Mandela.
A prolific anti-apartheid activist and the first black president of South Africa, Mandela, 95, died in his house surrounded by family.
In a television address to the South African people Thursday, President Jacob Zuma mourned the leader’s loss he said, “We’ve lost our greatest son.”
Born to a Xhosa chief in South Africa in 1918, Mandela was a restless activist from a young age. First imprisoned for his activism while a law student at the South African University of Fort Hare, Mandela continued his civil rights advocacy by joining the anti-apartheid African National Congress in 1942 and later founding the offshoot MK movement, an armed wing of the ANC. Mandela served as president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
During his time in activism and political office, Mandela never expressed hatred for the white population in South Africa that had brutally enforced apartheid and oppressed the country’s black citizens. His continued resilience and quiet dignity were never on display more than during the 27 years he spent in South African prisons after being charged with sabotage by the ruling pro-apartheid government. An imprisoned Mandela became the raison d’etre and de facto face for the anti-apartheid movement, spurring efforts both within South Africa and abroad.
After his retirement from politics in 1999, Mandela became a human rights icon whose voice was crucial in the movement to combat HIV/AIDS in Africa as well as the campaign for South Africa to host the FIFA World Cup, a feat realized in 2010. Mandela was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize with former South Africa President Frederik Willem de Klerk in 1993 for their work to end apartheid.
Mandela’s actions not only rallied a nation but disrupted an international community’s collective ideas about race and the African people, according to Amadou Kone, a professor in the Department of French from Cote d’Ivoire who teaches African literature.
“Africa needed to show that, like the other continents, it has eminent persons who incarnate the highest values appreciated by men from all over the world,” Kone wrote in an email. “Nelson Mandela is one of these great Africans. He is the purest incarnation of these individuals and his actions, his philosophy, his example are known in his country, in Africa and in the whole world and have changed how Africans are seen.”
At Georgetown, the “Mandela Effect” was no less profound. During the height of the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1980s, Georgetown students engaged in a sit-in on campus to urge the university to divest from businesses that invest in South Africa — a movement that inspired the current efforts of GU Fossil Free.
Georgetown students were also at the forefront of the anti-apartheid movement when, following a rally at The George Washington University in April 1985, they joined students from Howard University, American University and the University of Maryland in a “funeral march” to the South African Embassy, where they protested alongside 4,000 District workers, according to a 1985 American Committee on Africa newsletter.
Students and faculty alike were moved to learn of Mandela’s passing.
African Society President Jescinta Izevbigie (SFS ’14), who is from Nigeria, expressed that Mandela served as a role model for people around the world, not just Africans.
“He wasn’t just a leader but he was a resilient one, and he showed not only what African political leaders should strive to be but what human beings should strive to be. He took the impossible and made it possible,” Izevbigie said.
Gwendolyn Mikell, a professor in the Department of Anthropology and a former chair of the African Studies Program, has begun composing a poem in tribute to Mandela. It is titled “Madiba,” theXhosa nickname bestowed on Mandela by the people of South Africa.
“A massive baobab tree has fallen / this tree that seemed to live for so many lifetimes / a tree that sheltered all South Africa’s people within its trunk / that pushed for racial understanding within South Africa’s midst,” the poem begins.
Matt Chung (COL ’14), who studied abroad in South Africa in spring 2013, commented on what he saw of the country’s perception of Mandela.
“He is as visionary, as impactful as George Washington was for this country. In this same way George Washington built this country, led it through its revolution and was there through its transition to nationhood, Nelson Mandela led his country through an incredible social revolution and administered it through a period of transition until he felt the country could stand on its own two feet,” Chung said.
Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center, was in South Africa the day Mandela was released from prison in 1990.
“Nothing about Nelson Mandela’s life was predictable, not even his passing on his own time. … The world could not have predicted that out of his harsh imprisonment Mandela would become a model of selfless, even self-effacing leadership the world had not seen,” Norton wrote in a statement Thursday.
Mandela extended his vision of hope beyond South Africa, as exemplified by his inaugural address delivered May 10, 1994.
“We know it well that none of us acting alone can achieve success. We must therefore act together as a united people, for national reconciliation, for nation-building, for the birth of a new world,” Mandela said. “The sun shall never set on so glorious a human achievement.”

After expanding to New York and Boston this year, Sweetgreen has again raised its national profile. Founded by two Georgetown alumni in 2007, the salad chain will receive a $22 million investment from venture capital firm Revolution Growth, the firm announced Wednesday.
Revolution Growth, also based in Washington D.C. and founded by former AOL Time Warner Chairman Steve Case, former Exclusive Resorts CEO Donn Davis and Monumental Sports & Entertainment founder, Chairman and Majority Owner Ted Leonsis (CAS ’77), has thus far concentrated its investments in the tech industry, investing in startups such as Living Social and Zipcar. Sweetgreen marks Revolution Growth’s first investment in the restaurant industry.
Nicolas Jammet (MSB ’07), Jonathan Neman (MSB ’07) and Nathaniel Ru (MSB ’07) opened their first location on M Street in Georgetown shortly after graduating. Two years later in 2009, the trio opened a location in Dupont Circle before quickly expanding up the eastern seaboard;Sweetgreen now operates 22 storefronts.
“Nic, Jonathan and Nate have developed an iconic brand in an industry that is ripe for disruption,” Case wrote in an email to The Hoya.
With funding from Revolution Growth, Sweetgreen will focus on a three-pronged approach to the restaurant’s current team and structure as well as expansion.
“One is to invest in our people, so really invest in building a great team, invest in the culture, invest in training, really build the capabilities of a great company,” Neman told The Hoya. “The second is to invest in our community, to amp up our community efforts. And lastly we are going to expand Sweetgreen, not aggressively but I would say very consciously, both in the markets we are in as well as new markets.”
Case hopes Sweetgreen will become a model for quick dining beyond traditional fast foodrestaurants. The restaurant uses locally grown ingredients for most items on its menu and sells cold-press juices and frozen yogurt in addition to salad.
“We believe it has the potential to penetrate markets in every city across the country, building community and redefining how people eat, what they eat and what they should expect from fast-casual dining,” Case wrote. “The fast-casual restaurant market is the largest growing segment of the $435 billion restaurant industry, so the possibilities are really endless for the company’s growth.”
Neman shared Case’s optimism, putting forth his expansive long-term and short-term goals for the company’s growth.
“Our vision is to one day be the world’s number one healthy lifestyle brand, but for the near future, it’s to really focus on being the best healthy fast-food company in the country,” Neman said.
The Sweetgreen founders decided to accept Revolution Growth’s investment because of their belief in the two companies’ compatibility.
“We really share a lot of values; they have core values that we believe in, they really believe in our overall mission,” Neman said. “Their whole philosophy is to invest in businesses that will change the world for the better.”
According to technology blog TechCrunch, Case will join the Sweetgreen board and advise Jammet, Neman and Ru.
Neman emphasized that the funding will not affect the company’s values but rather allow it to continue to further develop its sustainable business model.
“The plan is not to go into hyper-growth mode — it’s still to take our time and to do things right and consciously,” Neman said.
Moving forward, the quality of Sweetgreen’s local, sustainable and organic ingredients as well as the brand’s focus on creating an experience sets Sweetgreen apart from other restaurants, according to Neman.
“The biggest difference when you go to Sweetgreen is it’s not just the transaction — we create an emotional connection with our customers and connect with each individual,” Neman said.

Although college tuitions continue to skyrocket nationwide, the rate at which average college fees rose this year was the lowest in 30 years, the College Board reported Oct. 23.
Georgetown, however, diverged from this trend. Tuition rose 3 percent, 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. This represents a 22.2 percent rise in the rate of tuition increase between 2012 to 2013, compared to 14.3 percent between 2011 and 2012.
Nevertheless, Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (COL ’64, GRD ’69) said that Georgetown has been striving to keep tuition increases under control.
“Overall, Georgetown has been successful, relatively speaking, during the last six or seven years at slowing the [tuition] growth,” Deacon said. “About five or six years ago we were one of the top five most expensive colleges in the country. Now we’re not in the top 50.”
Between the years 2008 and 2011, tuition increases at the university had remained largely around 3.0 percent, representing nearly no change in the rate of tuition increase.
“We’ve found that after three years, that level of increase was not sustainable for the fourth year without creating the possibility that there would be a negative impact on the academic excellence of the institution,” Vice President for Advancement Bart Moore (SFS ’87) said.
Despite an overall slowing in tuition growth across the country, the College Board also found that colleges are becoming less affordable, as the tuition increase rate outpaces the U.S. inflation rate, which was 1.18 percent last year. The net price of tuition, or the fees paid by full-time students after subtracting financial aid, have risen post-recession.
According to Deacon, the financial burden caused by tuition increases strains middle-income families the most. Students with higher demonstrated need receive more aid and therefore pay lower net prices, while students from more affluent families can more easily afford increased net costs. However, middle-income families qualifying for less aid often struggle to cope with tuition increases.
“We’re lucky enough to be in high demand, so people are willing to do whatever they can to do their share,” Deacon said.
But while tuition is Georgetown’s main source of revenue, tuition increases also correlate with higher financial aid costs. Due to the relatively small size of Georgetown’s endowment, these costs largely come from the university’s operational budget. As a result, increased financial aid expenses necessitate the restriction of internal costs so that total annual costs can keep pace with inflation.
“The way that we are making that work for the university is to maintain very close to zero real increase in spending, particularly on administrative and other areas that do not directly impact the student experience,” Moore said.
According to Moore, merit-based salary increases for administrators and other non-academic employees increased by only 0.75 percent this year to adjust for inflation. In recent years, merit increases have been as low as 0 percent.
Nevertheless, Deacon stressed that some spending increases are still necessary in order to retain the best faculty and maintain Georgetown’s academic excellence.
“You can cut costs dramatically, but you also undermine the quality of the experience that you’re getting for students and a place like Georgetown wants a high quality experience,” Deacon said.
As a result, the university is seeking other options to fund increased financial aid commitments.
“We are offsetting all of the increases in year-to-year costs of financial aid for the university through increases in our donor support for financial aid,” Moore said.
Currently, donor support accounts for 29 percent of the university’s financial aid budget, up from 16 percent at the start of the university’s ongoing capital campaign in 2006. The university hopes to raise that number to 45 percent by 2016.
“The leadership of the university continues to hold financial aid as the most important thing that we need to fund,” Deacon said.

The Georgetown University Francis J. Heyden Observatory recently underwent repairs to return the building to its full functionality.
Heyden Observatory, the third oldest observatory in the country and a national landmark, had been in need of repairs and improvements for a number of years. Last year, the observatory failed to win the Partners in Preservation Program community-based contest that would have restored the site with a $1 million grant. The site did win $5,000 for its participation, in addition to a further $5,000 in recognition of campaigning efforts.
The need for repairs to fix the observatory became urgent when the observatory dome’s rotating function broke last May, rendering the facility unusable to the Georgetown University Astronomical Society.
“We couldn’t use the main telescope, which is the whole point of the observatory,” GUAS Secretary Nick Childress (COL ’14) said. “And I think what most people are interested in when they come to the meeting for the first time, that’s what they want to do.”
Although the broken telescope inconvenienced GUAS, the main focus of the recent repairs for Georgetown’s Planning and Facilities staff was the observatory’s lead paint.
Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey said they started to replace the paint on the observatory’s base around four months ago.
Communication between members of GUAS and Planning and Facilities staff, who are in charge of campus maintenance, remained minimal, although GUAS had been attempting to communicate the need for repairs to the observatory since last May.
“We were trying to get in touch with facilities and get the ball rolling on fixing [the dome], not really having much success until maybe a month or two ago,” GUAS President Daniel Dylewsky (COL ’15) said. “And then we had also spoken to a professor in the physics department who’s also our faculty adviser, and he kind of helped us out with that. Then it just kind of out of the blue got repaired one day and they told us, ‘Hey, it’s fixed.’”
Morey emphasized that the staff followed typical procedure in communicating the need for repairs.
“When we do certain hazardous materials abatement, you have to do notifications of the area and the extent of the area because you don’t want someone walking into that. So we had to do onsite notifications of caution, hazardous materials abatement underway, that kind of thing,” Morey said.
The observatory, which is usually kept locked, is open to the public during GUAS meetings. However, because of the facility’s limited access and state of constant disrepair, Dylewsky sees it as an underutilized resource.
“It’s really cool to be able to see you’re looking through the same telescope and the same lens they used 150 years ago. I do feel a lot of people don’t really know about it,” Dylewsky said. “So often we have people come to meetings and say, ‘Oh wow, I never even knew this place existed, and this is so cool,’ so it is always rewarding when people do that, but it would be great if we could have more exposure and have more people come up and see what the building has to offer.”
In terms of future improvements, the university’s financial ability to make repairs remains a question.
“Generally, the way things get funded is there’s a whole bunch of requirements and then less resources to execute those requirements, and we have to go through a prioritization process,” Morey said.
The feasibility of using the observatory for academic purposes is not very significant, especially as Georgetown, which once had a prestigious research graduate astronomy program, no longer has instructional needs for the observatory. Georgetown offers one entry-level astronomy course in the physics department.
Professor Wesley Mathews, who teaches the astronomy course and advises GUAS, could not be reached for comment.
“If we could just have some more classes at least for undergrads, it would be nice,” Childress said. “I would like that to happen because I think it would help give more motives to fix the observatory — and not just fix it, but upgrade it.”

Several universities have announced new degree programs that value competency over time spent in the classroom in response to a proposal from the Department of Education that was released last March.
“The time-centered system just says if you take the coursework, get passing grades and meet our academic standards, you get the degree,” Lumina Foundation President and Chief Executive JamieMerisotis told The New York Times. “Competency is a student-centered, learning-outcome-based model. Where you get the education is secondary to what you know and are able to do.”
Since 1893, to be accredited, universities have based their curriculums on credit hours and years of study, but in light of President Barack Obama’s call for more affordable college educations, educators are seeking to re-evaluate this methodology, particularly for the 37 million Americans who do not have a degree, yet attended college.
Under these new programs, students would be evaluated based on some sort of tangible evidence of learning, such as exams. Generally, students work on their own and at their own pace, and the speed with which a student finishes a degree program affects the cost of the program.
Proponents of competency-based learning point to the discrepancy between sitting in a classroom and measured understanding.
“Now if you can meet the standards without going to college, fine,” Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce Director Anthony Carnevale said. “I mean, I understand that that bothers some people. Obviously this would reduce the demand for college, but if I can take a B.A.-level or graduate-level accounting competency, if I can meet the competency-based criteria for what somebody wants to hire as an accountant, if I never went to college, in the end, who cares?”
But while Carnevale acknowledged the benefits of competency-based learning, he said that the logistics are difficult. How to determine the body of knowledge required for a degree, how to measure a student’s knowledge and skill and how to create the necessary competency exams are all difficult questions that need to be addressed for a competency-based program to work.
“My guess is it’s probably not a substitute for the full experience, that is, there is a part of college education that is experiential, and there’s a part of it that is learning for its own sake,” Carnevalesaid.
Drexel University history professor Amy Slaton, an outspoken critic, agreed.
“It’s a red flag to me,” Slaton told The New York Times. “If you are from a lower socioeconomic status, you have this new option that appears to cost less than a traditional bachelor’s degree, but it’s not the same product. I see it as a really diminished higher education experience for less money and yet disguised as this notion of greater access.”
In addition, critics question the success of exam standardization. Philosophy professor Tom Beauchamp said that when he was in school, he was incorrectly placed into a more advanced German class than was suitable, simply based on the results of an inaccurate competency test.
“My concern here is that these things will become quite routine, as to what your level of competency is, and [the test] really will not gauge it well,” Beauchamp said.
Moreover, the idea of competency-based learning threatens the traditional style of teaching that most university professors are comfortable with.
Overall, while Carnevale said that he did not expect most universities to switch to such a system, competency-based learning has the potential to improve the quality of traditional, classroom learning.
“It will encourage [professors] to focus on what the student knows and can’t do, rather than whether or not they showed up at 7:30 in the morning,” Carnevale said. “The teacher is a problem-solver, not just someone who delivers material.”

The university’s ban on vehicles for undergraduates, instituted this summer, has been minimally implemented, with administrators relying on the ban itself rather than any methods of enforcement this semester.
“The goal here is not to make this a disciplinary issue; the goal is to manage the impact from the number of student cars in the neighborhood,” Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said.
The ban was part of the 2010 Campus Plan agreement Georgetown negotiated with its neighbors in July 2012. Although the Code of Student Conduct now explicitly prohibits students from parking vehicles on campus or on residential streets in Georgetown, Burleith and Foxhall, no disciplinary sanctions for violation of this rule are listed.
“We don’t plan to make any formal changes at this point,” Olson said.
In lieu of any administrative punishment, students cited because of the ban discuss the issue with administrators.
“I’d say at this point that what we have done is just had follow-up conversations about how to resolve the issue with students and that’s been our focus,” Olson said, declining to provide a specific number.
Georgetown University Student Association President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) emphasized the low priority of the ban for student government representatives.
“What we have been doing is focusing on transportation issues in general and just making sure that students have ways to get around,” Tisa said. “At the end of the day, how do you tell if a car is a student car? I haven’t heard of anyone having any issues with the policy.”
Possible enforcement systems to identify student cars could bring up concerns about labeling students.
“If the neighborhood or the university were to somehow label student cars as student cars, I think that you would be completely treating students differently than any other citizen of the city,” formerGUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) said.
According to Student Advocacy Office Co-Director and Disciplinary Review Committee member Ben Manzione (SFS ’15), the Student Advocacy Office has not been involved with any cases involving the student vehicle ban.
Olson additionally stated that there has been a very low number of students that have had to speak with the Office of Student Conduct.
“We’re dealing with the cases that come to our attention. In the Office of Student Conduct, there are not very many that have come to our attention. It has been just a very small number,” Olson said.
In addition, there have been exceptions made to the ban for a few students. Olson noted that some of the students that they have had conversations with due to violations of the ban have been some of the same students who have received exemptions.
The low number of cases seen by the SAO and the Office of Student Conduct has led students to believe the ban is informally enforced.
“At the very least, I think it’s fair to say they are not harshly enforcing the ban, simply because we haven’t seen cases, but that has to be taken with a caveat,” Student Advocacy Office Co-Director Michelle Mohr (COL ’15) said. “Just because we haven’t seen cases doesn’t mean they don’t exist.”

The Mask & Bauble Dramatic Society will have to raise $33,000 to replace the dimmer system in Poulton Hall’s Stage III, but, until its fiscal goals are met, the group has resorted to using ice cubes to keep the lights cool enough to operate during shows.
The performing arts group is fundraising to replace its dimmer system, which controls the changing light settings during its productions.
The current dimmers are 15-years-old and have required extensive maintenance recently, including the application of hair dryers set to non-heat functions to keep them cool during shows, according to M & B’s current Executive and Associate Producers, Harry Wilken (COL ’14) and T. Chase Meacham (COL ’14).
In Meacham and Wilken’s appeal, published on the program’s website, the tiered gift recognition structure revealed that $700 would provide an individual dimmer, while $8,000 would obtain an entire rack, which consists of 12 dimmers; either donation would secure naming rights, among other recognition schemes.
“They’ve just reached the end of their useful life, like everything on this campus at some point,” Department of Performing Arts Administrative Director Ron Lignelli said.
The troupe requires 48 new dimmers. To cover the cost, M & B has already dedicated $5,000 from its gift fund to the project. The Performing Arts Advisory Council announced on Tuesday that it would match M & B’s donation.
Lignelli hopes that the other $23,000 will come from alumni and parent donations.
“The connectedness of the alums is very strong,” Lignelli said. “I think that [raising the total] is very doable.”
For Michael Lokensgard (SFS ’90), a Georgetown and M & B alumnus, the gratitude he feels for the memories he made with M & B compelled him to donate.
“I have a lot of fun memories of it, and I’m able to help out, so why not?” Lokensgard said. “It was a great group of people. I probably keep in touch with more people from that organization than from any other group or class on campus.”
Wilken and Meacham believe that this sense of community continues in M & B today and will help them reach their goal.
“Everybody talks about Mask and Bauble with this insane passion and love, and I can completely relate to that,” Wilken said.
This dedication to M & B is apparent from the rapid speed of the donations made by alumni and others. Only two weeks after launching, M & B is a third of the way to reaching its $33,000 goal, having already raised over $12,000.
M & B leaders have set March 1 as the goal for an end date of the project, but the work will need to be completed over the summer when no shows are in production. The troupe only has two shows left on stage III this season.
For Wilken and Chase, that means that their hard work will come to fruition after they both graduate in May, but they said the timing did not bother them.
“If I can come back and see a show with no flickering lights, I will be so happy,” Meacham added. “It will all be worth it.”

International leaders highlighted the need for the current generation to combat the global HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis epidemics in Copley Formal Lounge Wednesday.
Ambassador Mark Dybul (CAS ’85, MED ’92), the executive director of The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, stated that there is an unprecedented opportunity for the current generation to face these diseases and mitigate their effect on future generations.
“So the real question is, do we want to be the first generation that’s had the ability to control these epidemics?” Dybul said. “Or do we want to be the generation that doesn’t and so that the next generation and the next generation and then the next generation possibly have to continue to deal with these diseases as public health threats?”
Dybul, who is a former Distinguished Scholar and co-director of the Global Health Law Program at the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, said that without action now, it might be too late as resources to contain future outbreaks will become scarce.
“If the infection rates start going back up, I don’t know that we have the science and I know we don’t have the money to bring them back under control,” Dybus said.
Georgetown University Vice President for Global Engagement Thomas Banchoff also acknowledged the importance of immediate action.
“We have a choice to invest now, or pay forever,” Banchoff said.
On Tuesday, President Barack Obama had announced the United States’ commitment to up to $5 billion in AIDS relief efforts.
“From the standpoint of the Obama administration, we are very happy with the results of the replenishment conference. Donors pledged approximately $12 billion yesterday,” The Global Fund Vice-Chair of Finance and Operations John Monahan (CAS ’83, LAW ’87) said. Monahan also acknowledged the importance of The Global Fund and its role in controlling these diseases.
A panel of speakers also addressed The Global Fund’s new approach to giving assistance to countries. The Global Fund hopes to give more power to the countries fighting these epidemics, rather than dealing with the diseases directly.
“I would hope this … dialogue is a way for us to say this is about mutual responsibility,” The Global Fund Chair of the Strategy, Investment and Impact Committee Todd Summers said. “It’s not about the U.S. and Canada and Germany coming to fix Nigeria’s problems.”
Mutual accountability and responsibility are both major parts of The Global Fund’s change in strategy. The aim is to be partners rather than encroaching on the sovereignty of other countries, Dybul said.
“If we respect them as human beings and as partners…that makes a difference,” Dybul said.
However, with mutual accountability comes the issue of who would hold actors responsible.
“The challenge here in this new paradigm, is to figure out who holds that accountability stick and how do you arm them to use it,” Summers said.

Federal budget cuts to the National Institute of Health have already started to take their toll on researchers at the Georgetown University Medical Center.
With a fiscal year 2013 budget of $32 billion, the NIH, the nation’s leading medical research agency, will face a $600 million budget reduction come January. These cuts are in addition to the 5 percent loss that amounted to $2.9 billion the NIH incurred in the fall.
According to Dean for Research Dr. Robert Clarke, the GUMC receives more than 80 percent of all external research funding given to Georgetown University.
“Georgetown faculty members continue to make difficult choices about decreasing the scope of their projects and possibly reducing staff,” Clarke said. “Students probably feel that impact the most because there may be fewer opportunities to participate directly in the work happening in a lab.”
In the wake of these cuts, the NIH has begun exploring the number of grant applications that Georgetown and other universities can submit for review.
According to Sally J. Rockey, the NIH’s deputy director for extramural research, writing and reviewing applications is a costly enterprise.
“We have to think about it as a community, how we control demand, because writing applications, submitting applications and reviewing applications is extraordinarily costly to the community,” Rockey said in a quote to the Chronicle of Higher Education.
Georgetown professor of chemistry Paul Roepe, who recently published a study in the online journal PLOS ONE that explained why drugs designed to fight off malaria sometimes stop working in people, said the issue of decreased funding is being vigorously discussed among research-active professors.
“The feeling is increasingly dismal that our government and other funding sources will ever correct the current situation,” Roepe said.
According to Clarke, funds from approved grants can support the cost of research, including salaries of research staff, costs of research equipment and other expenses, such as travel fees and spending to meeting federal regulatory requirements for research.
“Without these funds, the amount of research we could conduct would be very small in comparison with the amount we actually do,” Clarke said.
While the number of grants approved by the NIH has remained relatively stable in recent years, the success rate of these grants has not. According to the NIH Data Book, which provides summary statistics on grants and organizations supported by the institute, grants had a 32 percent success rate in 2000; today, that rate is hovering above 15 percent, and the NIH projects 640 fewer research grants will be issued this year than in 2012.
Diminished research, according to Roepe, could significantly affect the independent thinking that a research-based learning environment can cultivate in students.
“Good researchers become independent, rigorous critical thinkers, and that’s what we want you to be when you leave Georgetown,” Roepe said.
The decrease in grant approvals could also affect the university’s global ranking, according to Roepe.
“The single greatest factor that yields [college rankings] is not a lower quality of our work but the relatively small volume of research that we produce compared to other top universities,” Roepe said. “Since basic science attracts much more external research funding than most other fields, Georgetown continues to lose ground relative to other universities in terms of overall research productivity,” he said.
According to Roepe, while research continues to lead to new developments paramount to society’s growth, he said he fears the issue of lost research funding continues to be overlooked.
“I worry that in the face of all the other issues that clog our airwaves and political arguments, this one will be lost in the shuffle,” Roepe said.

The Initiative on Catholic Social Thought held its second dialogue focusing on poverty under the Pontificate of Pope Francis Monday night in Gaston Hall.
The event, “The Pope and the Poor: Challenges of Pope Francis and Catholic Social Thought for American Poverty,” featured Washington Post columnists E.J. Dionne and Michael Gerson, National Review Online Editor-at-Large Kathryn Jean Lopez and Stephen Blaire, the bishop of Stockton, Calif.
The initiative, led by Director John Carr, stemmed from an idea from the Office of University President John J.DeGioia that aims to advance Catholic social teaching in relation to current political, social and economic issues, with the intent to promote the common good.
Speakers asserted Pope Francis is unique in his approach to remediating the challenges of the poor because he is willing to challenge Church convention by emphasizing tenets long ignored.
“The reason that Francis is so powerful and attractive is that he talks like Jesus and acts like Jesus,” Gerson said. “A Church that looked like this could transform the world.”
Conversely, other speakers asserted that the strength of Pope Francis’ approach to poverty does not lie in his strategy, but in the simplicity with which he communicates the problems of the poor.
“Pope Francis is speaking the Gospel in a common language that we can understand,” Blaire said. “He is speaking as a pastor who has been on the streets with his people in Buenos Aires.”
Panelists acknowledged the pope’s dissemination of message through comparatively modern methods, such as interviews with secular journalists, daily homilies and televised acts of charity and compassion.
The panelists also discussed the pope’s call for Catholics to take action against the injustice of poverty in society.
“Catholics all too often do not show lives that are different and conform to the Gospel,” Lopez said. “But if the pope can find time for other people, so can you.”
The speakers also mentioned the implications of the pope’s message, as Pope Francis has emphasized the need for unity between Catholics of both major American political parties in order to ably combat this problem.
Students in attendance felt the discussion caused them to reflect on their own roles in combating poverty and in the church.
“I was motivated to follow the role that Francis gives the Church when he said, ‘I prefer a church which is bruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets, rather than a church which is unhealthy from being confined and from clinging to its own security,’” Patrick Denenea (COL ’17) said.

A new summer study abroad option in Amman, Jordan, will replace the Office of International Programs’ offerings in Cairo and Alexandria, Egypt, that were cancelled because of turmoil in the region last year.
Both summer and fall programs in Egypt were cancelled because of unrest with students originally signed up for semesters in Egypt.
The Jordan program will be the sole Georgetown summer provider of training in Modern Standard Arabic.
The announcement comes nearly eight months after the OIP cancelled the 2013 Summer Program in Alexandria due to safety risks, while the fall 2013 study abroad program at the American University in Cairo was cancelled in July in response to the violent protests in the streets against Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi.
“We are sad to leave Alexandria, but obviously circumstances forced us to rethink, and the safety of our students is paramount. Jordan is quite stable,” Amman Program Co-director and department of Arabic and Islamic Studies professor Elliot Colla said.
“Being in Jordan will expose you to Syrian, Palestinian, Iraqi and Jordanian dialects, whereas in Egypt the only dialect spoken on the streets or taught in the classroom was Egyptian,” Colla said.
Even though the OIP has halted programs in Egypt, they hope it is only temporary.
“We hope to reestablish our semester programs in Egypt once the safety and security situation improves,” Director of Overseas Studies Craig Rinker wrote in an email.
In order to participate in the Amman program, students are required to complete at least one year of college-level Arabic study as well as 10 hours of preparatory work on colloquial Jordanian Arabic through Skype sessions with instructors from Amman.
The program’s curriculum offers both second and third level MSA classes, as well as an intensive program worth 12 credits, equivalent to a full year’s worth of Arabic study at Georgetown.
“We believe that a distinguishing feature of this program is the ability for students to earn 12 Georgetown credits of Arabic language credit over a summer, coupled with exposure to the vibrant Jordanian culture,” Rinker wrote.
The Qasid Institute for Classical and Modern Standard Arabic will be the academic home for participants in the program, and students will have opportunities to attend trips within the country- to Petra, the Dana Nature Reserve, Salt, Jeresh and Irbid.
“We encourage [participants] to get out in the street, to have conversations with people. This is a very important part to learning the language,” Colla said.
In order to help introduce students to Arabic culture and Amman’s social life, the expected 20 participants of the program will live in double rooms at the American Center of Oriental Research, with tutors and language partners familiar with the culture and area.
When students are not exploring the region during the nine-week program, they will attend three hours of class each morning from Sunday through Thursday, and study colloquial Arabic for an additional three to fours hours per week. At the end of the program, students are required to take a diagnostic placement test, which will be compared to their original placement test, to determine the progress they made. Total costs for the program are currently estimated at $10,800, not including airfare.
The new program has generated excitement among Georgetown Arabic students.
“I think that living and studying in Amman for the summer would be a really cool opportunity,” Devika Ranjan (SFS ’17) said. “It’s such a culturally rich place, and it’s not as rife with internal political issues or as concerning safety-wise,” Ranjan said. “I’m planning on grabbing the opportunity while I can.”

Georgetown debuted new changes to the Georgetown Mobile App in hopes to make the Georgetown bureaucracy easier to navigate and make the Georgetown-specific website more accessible.
The app now includes tabs for Laundry Alert, Student News, the Student Advocacy Office, Blackboard and travel information features.
“I think that the beauty of what you see now in the app is you see real time data, and it does provide, then, students a more effective way to manage their time,” UIS Deputy Chief Information Officer Judd Nicholson said. “They aren’t, then, spending a lot of time standing in front of a machine or going up and down stairs. You really can look at it, it will alert you when the machine is ready.”
University Information Services worked with student groups and solicited suggestions from the online Georgetown Ideas forum to develop the ideas for implementing changes to the app.
The idea for the integration of Laundry Alert, a program that alerts students of the availability and usage of washers and dryers in residence laundry facilities, originated from Hoya Roundtables and the work of Georgetown University Student Association.
The funding for the Laundry Alert feature was generated by students’ laundry service payments. Amounting to less than five percent of the total revenues, the money is usually used to upgrade dorm facilities.
“We had this much money for those kind of renovations, and we determined we could use this,” Vice President for Planning and Facilities Robin Morey said. “It was probably of better value than adding some furniture.”
As for possible glitches that may occur with the launch of the app, UIS relies on student feedback and testing for future improvements.
The Student News feature will include tabs where students can access articles by The Hoya, The Voice and its Vox Populi blog and GUSA.
The Student Advocacy Office’s section within the app will allow students to access frequently asked questions about the Student Code of Conduct, a feature already available on the office’s website.
“We came up with a list of frequently asked questions and we came up with some responses to them,” Student Advocacy Office Co-Director Ben Manzione (SFS ’15) said. “Then what we did was we abridged that list to put the most important ones, the information that would be most relevant to students on the go, we put that into the mobile app platform.”
The inclusion of the Code of Conduct FAQ on the mobile app allows the SAO flexibility with future changes.
“We ultimately decided on frequently asked questions because we thought we could cover the most amount of information that way,” Co-Director of the SAO Michelle Mohr (COL ’15) said.
The Blackboard capability of the app will also allow students to easily access courses, view announcements, open and view course materials and check grades posted on Blackboard.
The travel information feature of the app consolidates information for international students, showing an overview of visas and travel alerts and paperwork in other countries.
GUSA Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14), who shepherded the Laundry Alert function, feels optimistic about the app changes and the direction of university’s work with students.
“I hope this is part of a bigger trend where little winnings can help make campus, help make student life that much better,” Ramadan said.
