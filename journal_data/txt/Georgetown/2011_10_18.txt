As the Occupy DC movement gains steam more than two weeks after the first protesters headed to McPherson Square, Georgetown students and faculty are being drawn to the movement.
Hundreds of people, including at least 30 Georgetown students organized by the Georgetown Solidarity Committee, marched downtown Saturday to rally on the National Mall and protest in front of the White House and the Treasury Department.
These local demonstrations stemmed from Occupy Wall Street, a larger movement that began in New York City in mid-September. Though the protesters do not have a concrete platform, participants claim to give voice and numbers to the world’s frustration with the sour economic climate.
Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13), who has attended the D.C. protests twice, said that the movement’s value lies in its expression of the bottom 99 percent’s disappointment with the status quo.
“The way that I view the movement is as an expression and not necessarily a declaration of demands. Right now people are expressing their dissatisfaction and sometimes their anger with a system that’s failed 99 percent of them,” she said.
Katerina Downward (SFS ’14), who has participated in both Occupy DC and Occupy Wall Street, said that while her father is an investment banker, she believes it’s important to support the protesters.
“As a Georgetown student, I’m drawn to political causes, and I am in solidarity with working-class people,” she said.
According to Kathleen Smith, a visiting professor in the government department who teaches a class called Social and Protest Movements in Contemporary Society, Occupy DC lacks the leadership and group cohesiveness necessary to enact change.
“The more diverse their grievances [are], the less concrete their demands,” she said. “So far, the Occupy movement has not been able to translate their anger into an effective message. That’s the problem with movements that are hyper-democratic.”
When Reverend Jesse Jackson made an appearance at the protest site Monday afternoon, he criticized the disorganized nature of the movement, saying that it needs to channel its energy toward creating actual change.
“[Dr. Martin Luther Jr.’s] success lies in the fact that he made the oppression we faced illegal,” Jackson told the crowd that had gathered. “At some point we must turn occupation into legislation for protection.”
But Kohnert-Yount said that the movement is united by a common desire to see political and economic change.
“Every single person in McPherson square has a different reason for being there, but they all have one shared reason and that is their desire for justice,” she said.

Former Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi and heartthrob Bradley Cooper (COL ’97) have at least one thing in common: The Georgetown University Lecture Fund has sponsored both of them to speak on campus.
“Georgetown is internationally renowned for our high caliber of speakers, and the Lecture Fund works tirelessly to maintain this reputation,” Lecture Fund’s Vice Chair for Internal Affairs Tommy Evans (COL ’12) said.
Last year, Lecture Fund helped organize over 50 speakers to share their views on politics, current events, life experiences and more. But locking down these figures takes much more than a few phone calls.
From picking up a Hollywood celebrity at the airport to striking just the right amount of conversation with a prominent world leader, the responsibilities of the 14 Lecture Fund associate members vary across the board.
And associate membership in an organization with such a high-profile mission comes with stiff competition. This semester, 35 students applied for five available positions.
The personal interaction between the Fund’s associate members and the speakers allows the students to explore interests that they may not pursue in their academics or other extracurricular activities.
“Lecture Fund has a very dear place for me, mainly for it allows me to bring my ideas into reality and for it is a great platform to stay in touch with all speaking events that happen on campus,” said member Ceyda Erten (SFS ’13), who organized the TEDx Conference on campus last semester. “As a fan of TED Talks, I was able to put together a team of both Lecture Fund members and other members of the Georgetown community and initiated the TEDx Georgetown project.”
In order to conceptualize the arrivals of speakers like Karl Rove and Jane Goodall, Lecture Fund takes internal suggestions and solicits a wide range of speaker ideas from an array of organizations on campus. The Lecture Fund board then reaches out personally to speakers, whether through agents or personal connections. After making contact, the potential proposals are presented to the members of the group, which then vote on whether or not to allocate money from the fund for the proposed event.
The Student Activities Commission earmarked 17 percent of its total budget for Lecture Fund, or $19,067, for this semester. With an average price tag of $647 per lecture, Lecture Fund uses the SAC funds to pay for speaker fees and venues, which range from less than $100 to over $5,000.
On top of the funding, the group must solicit co-sponsorships from other student groups in order to cover additional costs like food and reception needs. Lecture Fund Chair John Gwin (SFS ’12) said they often reach out to groups that back the content of the speech or have a stake in being affiliated with such speakers.
“I guess we’re opportunistic in the sense that we’ll partner with any other group that is interested in covering the costs,” he said.
Gwin also noted that the timeline for securing a speaker and organizing the lecture depends heavily on unpredictable factors.
“It’s wildly variable. Some happen in two to three weeks, … but it could be much, much longer,” he said. “Usually, what takes the most time is if the speaker has a contract they need to have signed. That’s the most common factor. Other things are idiosyncratic or unpredictable. Speakers’ plans change.”
Once guests agree to speak at Georgetown, Lecture Fund focuses on the planning of the event, which can often be as complicated as the initial agreement.
“Booking these speakers is as much about logistics as ideology,” Gwin said. “Given the numerous details that go into the execution of the events, it is no wonder that any number of [things] can go wrong.”
According to Evans, the group dynamic surrounding the planning of events may even be better than the events.
“My favorite part of the Lecture Fund is, by far, working with the associate board to conceptualize, plan and execute events,” he said. “We have such an amazing group of brilliant and diverse people, and to hear their ideas and share my own with them is both an honor and incredibly rewarding.”
Event organization also helps Lecture Fund members feel connected to the campus at large, according to Erten.
“Because every lecture event has to be approved by the Lecture Fund, we also get to hear about all the exciting speaking events that a variety of student organizations put together,” she said. “I learn a great deal from hearing about what happens on campus, and I have attended many events that other student groups have put on. Helping those organizations advertise their events to a greater student audience allows me to give back.”
While Lecture Fund is often credited with bringing primarily political names to campus, the organization tries to hold events that appeal to students whose interests lie outside governmental affairs.
“When we think about the kinds of people that come to speak at Georgetown, we usually think of people from the Washington political arena, so it’s refreshing to have someone like Michael Moore come,” Andrew Markel (SFS ’15) said. “I think we have a pretty diverse range of speakers here.”

Sensitive personal information of 305 students, including names and university identification numbers, was accidentally sent to 26 seniors in the School of Foreign Service Monday.
The SFS dean’s office released the information of the students, who were all seniors in the SFS, via an email attachment sent to 26 recipients. Dean Mitch Kaneda informed the students whose information was disclosed by email Tuesday afternoon. According to Rachel Pugh, director of media relations, those 26 students who received the data were asked to destroy it. All 26 have confirmed doing so with the dean’s office as of Thursday.
“We take the security of student information very seriously, and we deeply regret this error,” Dean of the SFS Carol Lancaster said. “We are reviewing the incident and are taking steps to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. This shouldn’t have happened, and we apologize for it.”
Personal data, including students’ names, Net IDs and academic information, such as GPA and major, were inadvertently shared. More sensitive facts, such as the students’ Social Security numbers, were not disclosed.
“I was pretty upset because I feel like personal data of that nature shouldn’t be in a file that could easily be sent around,” said Emily Bertsche (SFS ’12), whose information was included in the data accidentally released.
“I wish I knew more information about what happened,” said Doug Wolff (SFS ’12), a senior whose GPA was included in the information.
The school sent out a clarifying response to those requesting more information about the error. Lucas Stratmann (SFS ’12), chair of the SFS Academic Council, said he hopes that the dean’s office will release the context of the incident.
“[An explanation] should be sent out to everyone so that there’s no uncertainty [about] what happened,” he said.
Some students, like Bertsche, feared that other personal data of hers could be contained in similar documents that could be similarly disclosed. She suggested that the SFS outline policies regarding the control and distribution of such information.
“It sounds like it was just carelessness … which could easily happen again. It’s hard not to let this affect my perception of the dean’s office,” she said.

A student was forcibly fondled Monday afternoon by an unknown male as she was walking in Burleith, according to the Department of Public Safety.
In a Public Safety Alert emailed to the campus community Monday night, DPS reported that the student was walking in the 3500 block of S Street at 2 p.m. when an unknown male approached her from behind and forcibly fondled her. The student went to the DPS station at 3:30 p.m. and reported the incident. There were no reported physical injuries.
The suspect was last seen running down S Street towards 36th Street, and is described as a black male in his 40s who is about 5-foot-10 with short hair and gaps between his teeth. The Metropolitan Police Department is investigating.
The incident is the second sexual offense reported by DPS this year.

A heated dialogue is mounting on campus as students gear up for conservative commentator Ann Coulter’s speech in Lohrfink Auditorium Thursday.
While students opposed to the event first expressed concern that the university would be paying $20,000 — Coulter’s standard asking price — to secure the visit of the outspoken figure, Lecture Fund clarified that $1,000 will be allocated.
The Georgetown University College Republicans will pay the remainder of Coulter’s negotiated $5,000 cost out of their gift fund, which does not include student fees.
Onni Irish (SFS ’12), Lecture Fund’s vice chair for external affairs, emphasized that the organization strives to remain objective in choosing speakers.
“We promote free exchange, and we are nonpartisan and that is extremely important to us,” Irish said.
Still, some students have taken a stand, sayng the invitation to Coulter is at odds with Georgetown’s ideals.
“I don’t understand why, if we’re a private religious institution, why we’re supporting the visit of a woman who alienates a part of our student population,” said Marissa Brogger (SFS ’13), referring to Coulter’s past comments that some have considered anti-Semitic. To protest Coulter’s visit, Brogger created a Facebook page that had 176 attendees as of press time. She has previously contributed articles to The Hoya and wrote a viewpoint in today’s issue, titled “Coulter’s Words Defy Georgetown Values.”
Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13), president of the College Democrats, echoed Brogger’s disapproval of the public figure. “While we respect Ms. Coulter’s right to free speech, we don’t endorse her values, and we believe it is evident that the majority of the Georgetown community doesn’t either,” she said.
In the wake of 9/11, Coulter was let go from her role as contributing editor to the National Review Online after she made anti-Muslim and anti-Arab remarks. A fierce critic of liberals and mainstream media, she has also jabbed environmentalists for alleged exaggeration of global warming. And during the 2008 presidential race, she used an anti-gay slur to describe former presidential candidate John Edwards.
Reiterating the Lecture Fund’s mission statement, Irish said that the organization approached Coulter’s visit with a commitment to promoting on-campus dialogue in mind.
Part of Young America’s Foundation’s Reagan 100 Scholars Lecture Series, a project to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of President Ronald Reagan, Coulter’s talk aims to foster a broader dialogue, according to the organizers of the event.
Chairman of the College Republicans Joseph Knowles (COL ’12) stressed the merits of bringing a controversial figure to campus.
“I don’t agree with everything that Ann Coulter says, but that’s what it’s about. It’s about … engaging with the speakers, and maybe they’ll respect what we think,” he said.
Knowles also noted that the $10,000 speaker fee for Michael Moore, a liberal filmmaker and commentator who spoke on campus two weeks ago, came entirely from university funds. According to Knowles, the Reagan 100 Scholars includes speakers like Coulter from across the conservative spectrum.
“With Ann Coulter, we move outside of the actual political establishment to conservative media and punditry,” Knowles said.
Thomas Lloyd, a staff writer for The Progressive, the College Democrats’ online publication, said he didn’t see the appeal of a speaker like Coulter.
“She is generally very offensive for the sake of being offensive,” he said. “She’s not an academic.”
However, Lauren McDonald (MSB ’14) was excited about her visit.
“I think it’s nice to hear from someone who’s so honest and also someone who brings some humor to the political talk,” she said. “She just really tells it like it is, and I respect her for that.”

Fresh evidence has renewed an ongoing federal investigation into alleged misconduct by the election campaign of D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray last fall.
On Oct. 15, The Washington Post reported that authorities had found new evidence regarding allegations that the Gray campaign bribed mayoral candidate Sulaimon Brown and illegally accepted campaign contributions.
According to Brown, the Gray campaign paid him in installments to publicly deride then-mayor and political opponent Adrian Fenty. He also claimed that the Gray administration promised him a position at the D.C. Department of Health Care Finance with an annual salary of $110,000.
Gray denies having offered Brown a job in exchange for his denouncement of Fenty, saying that he offered Brown only a job interview.
Sources close to the investigation told The Washington Post that the FBI has obtained the fingerprints of Brown and Howard Brooks, a consultant and friend of Gray’s campaign chairwoman, Lorraine Green. The agency may be able to use this evidence to determine who paid Brown to criticize Fenty.
This development comes after The Washington Post discovered in July that more than 100 cash contributions higher than the municipal legal limit were documented in campaign finance reports.
Interviews with contributors have suggested that the Gray campaign illegally turned cash into money orders, and the FBI has recently confirmed that signatures on some money orders were forged.
Scott Stirrett (SFS ’13), chair of the student advocacy group DC Students Speak, said that those accused must be considered innocent until proven guilty, but described the allegations as shocking nonetheless.
“It’s … concerning that there have been so many different corruption allegations. Students, especially those at Georgetown who have come to D.C. and have only been here for a few years … should expect a better kind of government,” he said.
The mayor’s office could not be reached for comment at press time.

The Student Activities Commission will present a draft of a proposed new funding system to club leaders Wednesday night that features a more flexible allocation system.
If the proposal is met with approval at the forum, commissioners said that they will implement the changes in time for next semester. In the new system, groups would be required to submit a comprehensive budget to the commission but would have more leeway in deciding where to focus their spending, addressing club leaders’ past criticisms of the current system’s rigidity.
According to SAC Chairman Andy Koenig (COL ’12) and Vice-Chair Ruiyong Chen (SFS ’13), commissioners have worked hard to include student group feedback in the new funding system.
“Commissioners have been reaching out to student groups at a personal level,” Koenig said. “We can’t create this system in a vacuum. We definitely understand that student group input is an important part in this. This system is for student organizations.”
Under the current model, student groups submit their programming plans for the semester, listing events by types based on their categories and sizes. The organization is then allocated a set amount of funding for each event.
Koenig and Chen explained that this system’s flaws stem from variances in how much events actually cost. In the potentially revamped system, student groups will submit line-item budgets for each of their intended programs. Groups will not be required to plan for every individual purchase, but instead will budget for general categories such as food or space rental.
“There is an issue that student groups have raised, thinking that we are going to be going through these budgets with a fine-toothed comb saying, ‘You can save eight dollars here and 10 dollars there,'” Koenig said. “However, in actuality, we’re going to allow groups as much leeway as possible.”
Commissioners also said that the new system will increase flexibility when it comes to adding programming requests mid-semester, addressing another major concern that group leaders have raised about the current system.
“Groups will be able to add events midyear, assuming they can meet a certain set of requirements,” Chen said. “But you can definitely present programs midyear with this system.”
Koenig said that he hopes that Wednesday’s forum will allow students to bring up issues to further refine the proposal.
“If things come together and are working well by the beginning of November, we will be set to switch to the new system for the second semester,” Koenig said.
While the discussion about next year’s funding guidelines continues, SAC is also preparing for elections of a new chairman. Each of the three candidates in the election, which will wrap up Thursday, expressed dissatisfaction with current policies and procedures.
The candidates — Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14), Dalvin Butler (COL ’13) and Carlos DeLaTorre (COL ’13) — all said that they will work to continue the reform process. The winner of the election will take the helm of SAC in January.

Opening the university’s celebration of the 150th anniversary of the unification of the Italy, Italian Ambassador Giulio Terzi di Sant’Agata stressed the importance of the ties between Italian and American culture Friday.
The day’s events in Lorhfink Auditorium, which focused on Italian politics, culture and identity, were organized by the Italian Department, the Embassy of Italy and the Italian Cultural Institute in D.C. The conference, which opened to a crowd of around 50 students, was frequented by classes of Georgetown Italian students through the day.
Terzi stressed that the idea of Italian unity had been a cultural theme for several centuries before the country achieved political unification. While the country faces some regional tensions, Terzi said a sense of camaraderie remains highly valued on a societal level.
“This is a strong encouragement for all Italians in the country and worldwide to unify in their culture, if not necessarily politically,” Terzi said.
The ambassador attributed the unifying strength of the Italian culture to the fact that the vernacular has been maintained since the days of Dante.
“The language spoken seven centuries ago can still be understood by most Italians, which is an idea that few cultures can lay claim to,” he said.
American interest in learning Italian has increased by 60 percent in less than a decade, according toTerzi. Effects of this growth can be witnessed in the creation of the Observatory of the Italian Language, the implementation of an Advanced Placement Italian program by the College Board, effective in fall 2011, and other programs that have been spearheaded by the Italian government.
“There is no doubt that learning Italian is increasingly popular in the United States,” he said.
“All of these programs are part of a large initiative which includes many inter-university programs,” Terzisaid.
Learning about the social differences of the European country attracted some students.
“I most enjoyed the presentations by Professors Cicali and DelConno on theater and music during the unification of Italy,” John Collins (COL ’14) said. “Recognizing the importance of entertainment outlets such as theater and music in educating the Italian public about the Risorgimento [Italian unification] wasenriching.”
Emphasizing that the Italian government stays committed to strengthening its relationship with the United States on both a federal and a public level, Terzi credited the development of American interest in Italian society and fusion of the two cultures to Italian-American organizations.
“This gives the impression [that] Italy is on solid ground,” Terzi said.

In an effort to better align themselves with student concerns, the Georgetown University Student Association is developing a website to gather suggestions for potential projects.
President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) and Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) campaigned last winter with the promise to launch a website that allows for student input. Secretary of Information and Technology Michael Crouch (MSB ’13) is now working to bring their pledge to fruition.
“I think this project is significant because it provides a means for the entire undergraduate student body to be able to directly converse with GUSA and for all other students to rate and comment on their suggestions,” Crouch said. “Essentially what it does is create a dialogue between GUSA and the student body.”
Meaney said that he hopes the site will allow GUSA to act as a better advocate for student interests.
“It’s one more way, where if students have an issue and they don’t know where to go or who to turn to, they can go to this website,” he said. “The issue will come to our attention, and we could then bring a lot of the concerns to the appropriate members of the school administration who can actually do some of these things.”
Although GUSA maintains a Twitter feed and Facebook page, Crouch said that these services have so far been one-sided, as they have been used to raise awareness of the association’s activities instead of providing platforms for suggestions from the student body. Crouch hopes to implement more feedback into GUSA’s social media pages in addition to creating the new site.
“Social media is meant to be a place to network, a place to maintain and develop conversations,” Crouch said.
The George Washington University Student Association recently launched a similarly-aimed site using the paid web service UserVoice. The site allows users to post and then vote on suggestions for an organization to implement. The most popular ideas are then featured prominently on the site. GWUSA’s service, known as G-Voice, has collected hundreds of votes for its 15 user-generated proposals.
“It’s … where a lot of student governments are going with how to keep track of the concerns of students, and that’s something that we would like to do as well,” Meaney said of GUSA’s plans.
Crouch said he is considering implementing UserVoice because it has a user-friendly interface and can be easily integrated into the existing GUSA website. The project is projected to be launched next semester.

With the School of Nursing and Health Studies’ Nursing @ Georgetown program, master’s nursing students learn the profession with experts from the Hilltop community from the comfort of their own homes.
The online program, which was instituted in March, gives working nurses the opportunity to obtain their master’s without leaving their clinical posts at 26 sites in 11 states across the country. The program has expanded dramatically since its inception, swelling from an original projected enrollment of 25 students in the spring to a total of 110 this fall.
For students, the program allows nurses to take classes via video chat and submit assignments over the internet, earning a Georgetown degree without the added cost of moving to the District.
Nurses like current student and Texas resident Melissa Pridemore continue to work at clinical sites near their homes while studying through the Georgetown program, gaining firsthand experience that mimics what they would learn on campus.
“It has been a wonderful program. This is the only way I could pursue a master’s degree with a job and family,” she said.
But the model is not without its drawbacks.
Stephanie Tsacoumis, the vice president of the Office of University Counsel, said that the program is working to foster better technology to serve its students’ needs.
“As in anything new there are some snags, but we’ve gotten good feedback from the students and faculty [regarding technology use],” Tsacoumis said.
“We were able to work out any of the issues that did arise,” Pridemore said, noting the flexibility of Georgetown’s online model in comparison to those used by other programs.
“When you really started looking at the other courses [at other universities], most of them were really correspondence-based [and less interactive],” she said.
Jeanne Matthews, the interim chair in the department of nursing, touts the program’s financial benefits for both the university and its students as the key to its dramatic success.
“Successful programs generally provide new revenue, and this new revenue contributes to a greater level of investment back into the program. Our economic model is a strong one since most of the costs associated with the program are variable costs.”
But Georgetown’s program is still more expensive than those run through other universities. The tuition rates for the degree are the same as those for on-campus students, $1,623 per credit hour. Students may also apply for and receive financial aid from the university.
“[Georgetown’s] program is more expensive than the other programs I looked at but for me, it was worth it for the quality of my education,” Pridemore said.
But according to Matthews, all the costs of tuition will go back into funding NHS programs.
“The vast majority of the revenue generated through tuition, like with all of our programs, is invested back into the program in order to provide both current and future students with the highest quality educational experience.”
Matthews said that Georgetown’s program is utilizing an advanced media platform developed by online education software company, 2tor. Other partners with 2tor are University of Southern California and University of North Carolina.
“There have not been any unforeseen drawbacks as we were thoughtful and deliberative in our planning process. We knew that there would be significant hurdles to clear with respect to state regulatory issues … in terms of being approved by a state to operate our program there. But that has moved along quite well,” she said.
According to Matthews, the program is currently approved to operate in 42 states, the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands.
Tsacoumis said that other departments in the university do not have currently have plans to implement similar online programs, but she hopes that Nursing @ Georgetown may someday extend overseas to serve students in developing countries who do not have access to high quality educational institutions.
For the present, she said the program is expanding to serve a practical need for aspiring nurses across the country.
“[The program is] an opportunity to extend the university’s mission,” she said. “We are serving a market of nurses who want to get graduate degrees from a high quality program and high quality institutions.”

After signing up for the Lecture Fund email list my freshman year, I have been to and seen plenty of exciting and informative events and speakers. While serving as a Georgetown University Student Association senator this past year, I admired the Lecture Fund’s ingenuity and the diverse range of guests it brought to campus.
I appreciate that the Lecture Fund sought to bring Republicans, Democrats, comedians, scientists, artists, poets and actors — all in all, an incredibly dissimilar group of people, whose only similarities were that they had been able to address Georgetown’s student body. However, I was a bit taken aback, and frankly saddened, to receive the recent email “proudly announcing” Ann Coulter’s visit to campus.
This is not an issue with Coulter being a conservative or a Republican but rather the fact that she has displayed a record of prejudice and hatred in both her written works and public appearances. I find it troubling that Georgetown is sponsoring a visit by Coulter through the Lecture Fund. In doing so, the Lecture Fund and the university’s administration are betraying and alienating a portion of our student body. I appreciate that the Lecture Fund has invited other controversial speakers in the past — notably Michael Moore — but these speakers have not directed the same hateful statements that Coulter has concerning various minority groups.
Coulter’s demonstration goes far beyond political passion into the territory of hateful vitriol. There is a line between political opinion and bigotry, and she has made a career of crossing that line and attempting to redraw it over and over. Coulter has, on record, made several anti-Semitic and anti-Islamic remarks over the course of her career. Isn’t Georgetown a school founded on the basis of religious understanding? Isn’t it hypocritical for our school to welcome a speaker who believes a significant portion of our student body is religiously inferior?  Coulter has also gone to great lengths to single out the widows of 9/11 victims — meaning parents of several Georgetown students — saying that they “enjoyed their husbands’ deaths.” She also devoted an entire chapter in her last book to claiming that single mothers were the reason for high rates of homicide, rape and other violent crimes.
As the Jewish child of a single mother, I am both a mistake and an imperfection to Coulter. I was under the impression that at Georgetown I was neither. Frankly, I feel betrayed. As a student from the New York area, I was in close contact with many families who lost loved ones on 9/11; none of them enjoyed those deaths. Coulter’s views on Muslims in America are even more disturbing and hateful. She has called the religion of Islam a “car-burning cult.”
I understand the Lecture Fund’s goal is to bring to campus a wide array of individuals with diverse perspectives, and I appreciate that greatly. However, how is bringing a speaker who holds hatred for any part of our student body to campus a fulfillment of Georgetown’s most important ideals? If Coulter had made those remarks as a student here, she would be violating the Student Code of Conduct. Her hatred has no place on the Hilltop. Georgetown’s collective identity doesn’t mean that we all share one political or religious belief but rather signifies a shared understanding that every student at Georgetown is an integral part of our community.
Ms. Coulter would have us believe otherwise. Her remarks and ideals are not only offensive to me but to every student at this school who comes from a single parent family, every student at this school who celebrates the traditions of Judaism or Islam and every student at this school who lost a loved one on 9/11.
This may be a small population of our student body, and although it may be unworthy to Coulter, it is not invisible.
