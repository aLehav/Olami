A fire broke out early Sunday morning at a non-student residence at 1930 37th Street. While the extent of the damage is still unknown, no injuries were reported, according to Oscar Mendez, acting public information officer for D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services.
According to Director of Off-Campus Student Life Anne Koester, the university has no records of any Georgetown undergraduate, graduate or medical students living in the house in Burleith where the fire occurred.
A neighbor who requested anonymity said that she and her family tried to control the fire while two other neighbors rescued an occupant of the burning house, who was found dazed in the burning building according to the interviewed neighbor. These neighbors also notified the interviewed neighbor about the fire and called 911.
The fire was reported at 2:36 a.m., and the fire department responded three minutes later according to Mendez. Six fire trucks and at least two ambulances responded to the scene, along with the standard Metropolitan Police Department deployment. MPD taped off the 1900 block at the time, and fire trucks began to leave the residence at 3:40 a.m.
The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but Mendez said it started in the basement of the townhouse. No residents were found in the house when D.C. Fire and EMS responded to the scene, he added.

The Georgetown University Student Association is working with the Department of Public Safety and the Office of Facilities and Student Housing to implement the installation of GPS trackers in university transport vehicles.
While the initiative is in its early stages, GUSA is looking to partner with DoubleMap, a provider of GPS tracking technology. The objective is to place devices in all GUTS and Safe-Rides vehicles so that students can track the location of these services via a website or smartphone application.
“What is so attractive about this is that it helps to solve a lot of problems in one initiative,” GUSA Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) said.
DoubleMap has worked with transportation shuttles at Indiana University and Butler University in Indiana and has offered to implement the technology at Georgetown free of charge.
Laverriere added that GPS tracking would lessen the time DPS takes to inform students about SafeRides schedules and to dispatch vehicles while also serving as a way to increase student use of the free transportation.
“If I’m in a bar on M Street or in a movie theater, I could use the GPS system to figure out when to leave. … It decreases the number of students walking back late at night, decreasing noise,” Laverriere said.
The program is the latest in a series of GUSA transportation initiatives. Earlier this year, GUSA partnered with the university to add a third neighborhood shuttle on M Street from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m., Thursday through Saturday nights. This Friday, GUSA will also reintroduce a program that allows GUSA members to drive SafeRides vans.
Though the plan was initially put in place by former GUSA President Calen Angert (MSB ’11) and Vice President Jason Kluger (MSB ’11) in 2009, various logistical and administrative hurdles have delayed the initiative’s implementation this semester.
The initiative will have one GUSA member drive one van per weekend, though GUSA is looking to expand the program with the ultimate goal of institutionalizing SafeRides as a fully student-run service.
A GUSA work-study program that would allow non-GUSA members to serve as student drivers is also in the works, though GUSA President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) stressed that the particulars of the project are still being hammered out.
These initiatives would further a growing trend of upgrading Georgetown’s late-night transportation services in order to alleviate noise on weekends.
“The M Street shuttle is one of several initiatives the university is investing in to maintain the quality of life in the neighborhoods around campus,” university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr wrote in an email.
According to Kerr, the shuttle has seen 8,977 riders to date, averaging roughly 309 students per day.
Jake Sticka (COL ’13), the Georgetown student representative on the Advisory Neighborhood Commission, added that the M Street shuttle has been well received by the surrounding community.
Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E Chair Ron Lewis was less certain about the effectiveness of the M Street shuttle in reducing noise and rowdiness in the neighborhood.
“I’m gathering data now from everyone in the community,” he said.

Alcohol-related calls to Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Services have held steady this semester, according to GERMS.
Of the 250 calls GERMS received from early move-in through Halloween weekend, 49 were alcohol-related, representing 19 percent of the total. This rate of alcohol-related calls is 1.5 percent higher than last year’s.
This Halloween weekend alone, GERMS received 22 calls, 32 percent of which were alcohol-related. Homecoming weekend was GERMS’s busiest of the semester, with 28 overall calls, 36 percent alcohol-related.
GERMS Director of Public Relations Emily Malavenda (NHS ’13) pointed out that these figures do not accurately reflect the breakdown for all calls throughout the school year. The student-run EMS adds a secondary crew for weekend nights and holidays when more calls are expected, such as homecoming and Halloween.
Over the course of a school year, GERMS typically receives 900 to 1000 calls. Although GERMS services both the university and surrounding neighborhoods, calls originating from campus are the most common.
Of the total number of calls this semester, 68 percent ended in transport to the Georgetown University Hospital, while the remaining 32 percent of patients refused treatment and transportation to the hospital.
The majority of calls made to GERMS are due to sports injuries, according to the GERMS website.

Students from a neighboring D.C. university were arrested last week by Metropolitan Police for violating the district’s noise ordinance, according to an email sent to Alumni Square and townhouse residents Thursday evening by Hall Director Viraj Patel.
The Office of Off Campus Student Life was tipped off about the arrests by a Metropolitan Police Department source. Though Patel confirmed that students who were arrested were not affiliated with Georgetown, they live in Police Service Area 206, which includes the Georgetown campus.
“As you look forward to …. Halloween festivities this weekend, … we wanted you to be aware that D.C. police are enforcing nighttime noise laws, and these laws should be taken seriously,” Patel wrote in the email.
The Disorderly Conduct Amendment Act of 2010, signed by Mayor Vincent Gray on Jan. 19, 2011, went into effect on Feb. 2, 2011. The ordinance prohibits D.C. residents from making “unreasonably loud noise” between 10 p.m. and 7 p.m. Violators of the law can be fined up to $500 or face up to 90 days in prison.
According to Rocco DelMonaco, vice president for public safety, the university notified students in hopes that they would adjust their noise levels for the weekend with the ordinance in mind.
“We want students to be aware that [Metro] Police are enforcing D.C.’s nighttime noise laws,” he wrote in an email. “In proactively educating our students about this law, we hope to prevent incidents where [Metro] Police become involved and hope to help keep noise levels down in residential areas.”
The law has sparked controversy since its inception with critics calling the language of the statute too vague allowing police subjectivity to be the sole determinant of whether or not a person is arrested.
DC Students Speak, an organization that advocates for the 85,000 college students in the District, said that while the law should be followed, it should be more fully defined.
“A law that is on the books is a law that should be respected and adhered to fully and at all times. That being said, the new amended noise ordinance is too vague and results in a waste of valuable D.C. police resources,” Communications Director Jason Gerson (COL ’14) said.

A teenager shot in the head on the 2800 block of M Street shortly before midnight Monday remains in critical condition in a local hospital, according to the Metropolitan Police Department Public Information Office.
Witnesses reported hearing three gunshots andMPD responded to the scene at around 11:49 p.m.
“People here were enjoying the festivities, and that’s basically all we know right now,” MPD Commander Michael Reese said at the time.
He added that witnesses should contact MPD.
“We know that there were several people in the area, and someone must have seen something,” he said.
So far MPD has no information about possible suspects or motives in the incident, which was one of five shootings that occurred in the District Monday night.
