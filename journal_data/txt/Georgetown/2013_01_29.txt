A room in McCarthy Hall was recently burglarized, according to a Department of Public Safety alert.
Between 12 p.m. Monday and 8 a.m. Tuesday, someone entered a student’s unlocked room and stole a book bag containing a laptop, textbooks and ear buds. There were no signs of forced entry and the victim was not hurt.
The Metropolitan Police Department responded to the incident.

The Georgetown University Student Association has begun research for an Intellectual Life Space Report, which will offer recommendations on how to improve students’ academic experiences on campus.
GUSA Secretary of Academic Affairs Jon Askonas (SFS ’13) said that it is important to draw a distinction between social and intellectual spaces.
“There definitely is often a fuzzy line between the two,” Askonas said. “The point is that viewing it only as social space hides and disguises the intellectual component.”
“The problem is that the Georgetown administration sometimes talks about space as a student life issue but not as educational issue,” he added.
The new report will contain an introduction detailing the background of the report, a history of how intellectual space has been used at Georgetown and a set of recommendations for spaces on campus. It will also feature a comparison of intellectual space usage at five peer institutions: University of Chicago, the University of Pennsylvania, The George Washington University, the Catholic University of America and Fordham University.
“Each [of these universities] share some similar characteristic with Georgetown, perhaps being urban, being in the same city or being a Jesuit school,” said Chris Mooney (COL ’13), chair of the report.
According to Askonas, GUSA is drafting the report after several of its senators overheard discussions about intellectual space on campus. GUSA published a similar report in 2010, which was conducted by the Student Space Working Group.
“This report is more of a follow up of the 2010 report on a smaller scale,” GUSA Chief of Staff JakeSticka (COL ’13) said.“The idea instead is to have a full study of what our spaces inventory on campus look like, especially the space students used in private life other than classrooms for intellectual discussions with both professors and fellow students.”
Mooney acknowledged that the Student Life Report and Intellectual Life Report compiled by the Main Executive Campus Faculty in 2008 both dealt with this issue, but he stressed that the upcoming report has a more specific focus.
“Looking at space is a way that we can look at one unique element of that intellectual life that is both meaningful and manageable,” Mooney said. “It’s like taking the big, broad picture of intellectual life and recognizing how large it is and taking a little chunk of that and working on that.”
GUSA will consult with the university administration to implement the report’s recommendations.
“We hope we can provide a broad set of recommendations that will show to the university that we’re thinking about this reasonably, whether it’s small changes to the way rooms are structured with a few extra chairs or big suggestions in new ways the university can organize some aspect of itself in the next five to 10 years,” Mooney said.
Mooney added that the central goal of the report is to base its recommendations on locations where students already gather.
“We want to think about where students are, which leads us to consider spaces such as the ICC Galleria, which is next to the most trafficked spot on campus,” Mooney said. “We also want to think about what impact will the New South Student Center have on spaces, where students will be, where the traffic will be flowing.”
“Without the right kind of spaces, students can’t have the kind of intellectual experience they should have,” Askonas said.

Yale History professor Edward Rugemer presented a draft of a chapter from his upcoming book to Georgetown faculty and Ph. D students Monday during the Georgetown Workshop in 19th Century U.S. History.
“We try to bring people to campus who are doing innovative work in 19th century American history to have a conversation about what they’re thinking,” said associate professor and director of graduate studies in the history department Adam Rothman, who runs the workshop along with associate history professor Chandra Manning. “There aren’t too many forums for this sort of thing.”
Though the book, “The Politics of Slavery Transformed: The Impact of Abolitionism and the Haitian Revolution in Jamaica and South Carolina,” is still in its early drafting stages, Rugemer expects to publish it in 2015.
The workshop focused on the seventh chapter, which analyzed the strong similarities between slavery in South Carolina and Jamaica. Both regions were “colonies of a colony,” had powerful enemies and were on similar economic tracks, Rugemer said. The differences between the two regions explain the different processes and paths of change within them.
“South Carolina’s ability to use a gag rule allowed them to maintain an argument based on political economy, whereas the Jamaicans were forced into a moral debate,” Rugemer said. “Carolinians wanted to be able to open up the slave trade and stop when they wanted to do it, and they had always done that. There is no moral rationality in that. America as an independent nation was better suited to address slavery.”
Rugemer, also author of “The Problem of Emancipation: the Caribbean Roots of the American Civil War,” said that he wanted to integrate plantation politics with national politics.
“The way I’ve organized the chapters is to organize them around comparable events of comparable developments,” Rugemer said. “It’s possible to go in-depth in these moments of crisis.”
Students noted that Rugemer was successful in balancing his specific subject with the bigger historical picture.
“Comparative history is great, but I think one of the things that can get lost is the larger national story,” Brian Taylor, a third year PhD student, said. “I think the balance here is good.”
Other students, however, said that the narrowness of Rugemer’s focus on South Carolina impeded the work.
April Yoder, a third year PhD student, said that the discussion was more involved than she’d seen in others.
“They challenged him more directly than I’ve seen on other ones,” Yoder said.
Chad Frasier, a first year PhD candidate, said that the discussion was a valuable experience.
“The product that is brought [in the workshops] is usually in some early stage of development,” Frasier said. “As PhD students, I think it’s valuable for us to see that even experienced researchers go through this process.”
Overall, participants felt that the workshop was a success.
“It was very helpful; I got a lot of good feedback,” Rugemer said.

This week, it will not be uncommon to see a Jesuit spiking a volleyball in Yates Field House, playing guitar in McNeir Auditorium or leading a Hindu worship service.
These happenings are among the events of the 13th annual Jesuit Heritage Week, a celebration honoring the Jesuit tradition at Georgetown that began with an opening mass in Gaston Hall Sunday and will continue until Saturday.
“The goal is to help people understand the tradition of which they are a part, and its different aspects: academic, spiritual, artistic and social,” said Vice President for the Office of Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J.
Jesuit Heritage Week was founded in 2000 by students aiming to connect undergraduates with Jesuits. Most Jesuit universities in the United States have similar celebrations of their heritage.
O’Brien advised the Jesuit Heritage Week student committee, which was led by co-chairs MaryaPulaski (COL ’13) and John Collins (COL ’14).
“I chose [Pulaski and Collins] because they are deeply devoted to our Jesuit tradition,” O’Brien said. “They are very active in university life, creative and deeply committed to developing their faith life and putting it into action. They embody the spirit of Georgetown.”
This year, the planning committee reduced the number of events from 28 to 22 after finding that last year’s celebration lacked focus. Specific events included in the week-long celebration will be different this year, with new additions including a Jesuits vs. Students Shootout during the men’s basketball game against Seton Hall University Wednesday and a discussion of Jesuit values and LGBTQ identity.
The committee also increased the event’s social media presence by promoting the week’s events through Facebook and Twitter, as did University President John J. DeGioia, who sent a campus-wide email and mentioned the week’s events on his Facebook page.
Pulaski and Collins worked closely with other members of the Georgetown community, including the department of performing arts, Lauinger Library staff and non-Catholic religious groups.
Pulaski and Collins mentioned Lives of the Georgetown Jesuits, an event where Jesuits will share their stories with students and parents, and the Jesuit Heritage Week Jam, at which Fr. Patrick Rogers, S.J., will perform alongside students and members of Campus Ministry, as highlights.
Pulaski stressed that the Heritage Week is a representation of Georgetown’s core Jesuit values in action.
“I’d like to think that Jesuit values are lived out at Georgetown,” Pulaski said. “This is the perfect opportunity to acknowledge the Jesuit values that we see on a daily basis but don’t always recognize. We can really see these values come alive in the student body.”

The Pentagon announced Thursday that it will lift its ban on women serving in combat roles, prompting debate about gender equality in the military and Reserve Officers’ Training Corps units across the country.
“[Equality] is one of the secretary’s priorities and the rescinding of this policy is all about ending gender barriers to services,” Lt. Cmdr. Nate Christensen, a spokesman for the Department of Defense, said. “The idea is to open up all jobs within the Department of Defense regardless of gender because our goal is to make sure that we have the best qualified, most capable people serving regardless of their sex.”
Each division of the armed services will develop its own plan to implement the decision, which strives to open 237,000 combat positions to women by 2016.
According to Christensen, the military will submit a report to Congress announcing the decision and then must wait 30 days before making changes. He expects that the plan will be fully implemented by Jan. 1, 2016.
Zachary Zimmerman (MSB ’14), a former Marine who served in two combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan from 2006 to 2010, said that the plan is an important step toward granting women opportunities for promotions in the military.
“It’s a difficult situation,” Zimmerman said. “In school, you are measured by your grades. In finance, you’re measured by money. In the military, you’re measured by the combat you’ve seen. You’re not going to find very many generals who haven’t had combat experience, so it’s very hard for women to move up the ranks who don’t have combat experience because they’re not exposed to it.”
Major Karen Saravia, assistant professor of military science and executive officer of Georgetown’s ROTC, expressed her belief that many female members of the military have not received appropriate recognition, especially for their unofficial service in combat.
“There isn’t a single uniformed member of our cadre who hasn’t served in combat with a female officer or soldier — I think all of us know some who have been killed or wounded in the line of duty,” she wrote in an email. “Danger is not something that is limited to one’s occupational specialty.”
However, Saravia said that the change will probably not affect current ROTC members or the curriculum, which requires basic infantry skills, or the willingness of women to partake in ROTC programs.
“The same passion to be part of an infantry company — to challenge oneself, to be part of a high-performing team, to serve one’s country — [is] already what attracts female cadets to ROTC and careers in other branches of our Army,” Saravia wrote. “As future leaders, they have [an] inherent desire to push their limits and enjoy being held to an extremely high standard.”
While he recognized why such a shift might be desirable, Zimmerman expressed concern that the military will not be able to maintain consistent combat standards across all branches of the military.
“If you’re going to bring women into the infantry and the forward operating units, you need to have one standard and it needs to be the consistent male standard,” Zimmerman said. “There’s a reason why we have the most elite fighting force in the world, and it is because we have incredibly high and rigorous standards.”
However, former Georgetown ROTC member Chloe Nalbantian (COL ’15) emphasized that many young women in the ROTC are capable of combat.
“Some of the most impressive and motivated young women I have met were in ROTC, and if they felt they wanted to enter in combat roles, I am sure they would be successful and would also have the support of all of the other members of ROTC, male or female,” Nalbantian wrote in an email.
Major political organizations in Washington have had mixed reactions to the military’s decision.
Ariela Migdal, senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union Women’s Rights Project, expressed her support.
“We are thrilled to hear [Secretary of Defense Leon] Panetta’s announcement today recognizing that qualified women will have the same chance to distinguish themselves in combat as their brothers-in-arms,” she said in a press release on Jan. 23. “But we welcome this statement with cautious optimism, as we hope that it will be implemented fairly and quickly so that servicewomen can receive the same recognition for their service as their male counterparts.”
The Family Research Council, a Christian organization and lobbying group, is opposed to the plan.
“[Women] have fought and served with distinction. However, placing women in infantry and other front-line units is a different issue and it has nothing to do with their courage or capabilities,” retired Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin wrote in a statement.
“The people making this decision are doing so as part of another social experiment, and they have never lived nor fought with an infantry or Special Forces unit.”

A new group of 25 students eagerly awaited their first day of McDonough School of Business classes on Jan. 25. Although their having jobs outside the classroom isn’t particularly unique among MSBgraduate students, the nature of their jobs is quite unusual — principals of Washington, D.C. public schools.
The principals are the first to take part in a specially designed year-long Executive Masters in Leadership program in the McDonough School of Business that was established by D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Kaya Henderson (SFS ’92, G ’07) in collaboration with the university.
Henderson, who is a graduate of the standard EML program, collaborated with University President John J. DeGioia to develop the concept, which is currently the only one of its kind in the country.
According to the MSB’s Senior Associate Dean for Executive Education Paul Almeida, Henderson’s unique educational background made her the ideal candidate to design such a program.
“The D.C. public school system is a challenging one,” Almeida said. “[Henderson] thought her experience made all the difference to her ability to lead this large and complex organization and she wanted to share this experience with her principals so they could move forward in a similar way.”
Principals were initially nominated by District administrators and then underwent a series of interviews and applications before being chosen.
The first round of principals comes from a variety of schools and range from those who have only worked for a few years in their posts to seasoned veterans. According to MSB Dean David Thomas, the main criterion for candidates was the ability to effectively manage schools with economically disadvantaged students.
“These are some of the most talented principals and principals who are oriented toward change,” Thomas said. “This is really a program to accelerate these leaders’ ability to make … lasting change.”
Tuition for EMLs at the MSB typically runs at about $66,000 per student, but this program is funded in part by the university and MSB scholarships, the City Bridge Foundation and a DCPS Teacher Incentive Fund grant. Only a small portion is paid by the participants.
Although administrators incorporated some industry-specific knowledge into the program, the content does not differ extensively from that of standard EMLs. Henderson wanted principals to learn to lead an organization regardless of industry, according to Thomas. Almeida said that while the business world can seem like a far cry from the halls of a public school, the two share many features in common.
“Most urban school systems have organizational, financial and sometimes motivational challenges,” Almeida said. “The [EML] is designed to help people move organizations forward in complex environments. It was a natural fit [for] the situation faced by the DCPS principals on a daily basis.”
The EML students will meet every other weekend and have three local retreats in locations such as Gettysburg, Penn., where they will use techniques including role-playing to identify and understand each perspective of a situation. They will also take classes at Georgetown and schools across the District.
This past weekend, the principals began their studies in a two-day retreat in Virginia.
“There’s nothing like 48 hours with 25 other people to get you connected,” Thomas said.
One of the goals for the small group is to create a close-knit network.
“We hope that two years from now, this first … cohort, they will be a support system for each other,” he said.
Administrators are confident that the principals will be satisfied with the time spent attaining their degrees despite the challenges of balancing the program with their day jobs.
“I told them when we launched it last week, two words will describe them at the end of the program: exhausted and exhilarated,” Almeida said. “It’s a real Georgetown degree. We don’t change our standards. … We don’t dumb it down.”
“Their first few weeks in the program, probably the majority realize that despite the truth in advertising, it’s even more intense than they expected,” Thomas added. “What we find, though, [is that] once the executives are into the experience, they get hooked on the learning.”
After the first group of principals graduates in December 2013, the university hopes to continue to further develop and improve the program.
“I think we have the seeds of something extremely wonderful here,” Almeida said. “Now we have to nurture that and grow it.”

While Dartmouth College announced earlier this month that it would no longer offer academic credit to students for their Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate scores because faculty and administrators do not believe the high-school programs are sufficiently rigorous, Georgetown has no plans to follow suit.
Dartmouth’s decision came after its psychology department administered a condensed final exam to students who qualified for credit based on their Advanced Placement Psychology exam scores. Ninety percent of students who took the exam failed.
According to The Dartmouth, the university’s student newspaper, the school had been considering eliminating pre-matriculation credit for about a decade.
The policy will be implemented beginning with the Class of 2018, but it has already ignited debate among students and faculty.
Although Provost Robert Groves wrote in an email that Georgetown currently has no plans to change how it awards academic credit, others question university regulations..
“If an institution has … pride in what it has to offer, it wouldn’t be giving tons and tons of AP credits,” psychology Professor Steven Sabat said. “That’s like saying what we can offer you here is no better than that [exam].”
Nonetheless, students expressed concern over the possibility of matriculating into Georgetown without AP credits.
Kevin Phelan (MSB ’16) received credit for AP Psychology and since coming to Georgetown has taken abnormal psychology and social psychology in order to potentially pursue a psychology minor. He said that although he would be fine with not receiving credit and being placed into a higher-level course the complete elimination of recognition of pre-college courses would prevent him from pursuing more classes.
“I’d probably be deterred from taking General Psychology again,” Phelan said.
Other students say that AP credits should be considered more holistically.
“I think the entire system is somewhat backwards,” Katie Farrell (COL ’16) said. “As applicants, we feel we have to take a lot of AP classes to get into the top schools or because those were the right level of classes for the challenge we desired, the same drive that brought us to Georgetown. We were not taking them so much for placement or credit; those are just bonuses in case the AP courses helped us be admitted.”

Erin Riordan (COL ’15) and Kat Kelley (NHS ’14) were spending yet another late night lamenting the perception of feminism at Georgetown when they decided to do something about it.
The two students decided to create “Feminists-at-Large,” a blog that aims to examine feminism from a variety of perspectives, discussing everything from gay rights to women in the military to slut shaming. They launched the blog Jan. 22.
“I think there was this frustration that there are a lot of very real issues relating to feminism on this campus: sexual assault, rape culture, all of that sort of stuff that really [is] not talked about or addressed on a wide scale,” Riordan said. “Part of that is because so many people do roll their eyes at those conversations or roll their eyes at feminism.”
For Kelley, the blog responds to her realization that gender equality is at the heart of numerous important academic disciplines and questions.
“As I progressed through my time at Georgetown, I began to realize that women’s empowerment is literally key to everything,” Kelley said. “It’s not this pet project — it’s key to economic growth, it’s key to development, it’s key to health, it’s key to national security.”
The pair also envisions the blog as a resource for those who are not familiar with feminism.
“It’s also about making it accessible to people who aren’t already feminists … [and] who aren’t used to this sort of dialogue,” Riordan said. “They can be a part of it, too, and can gain from it whatever they will.”
While Riordan and Kelley acknowledge that problems like sexual assault and gender inequality run more rampant at other schools in the United States, they maintain that Georgetown must improve its approach to gender equality.
“There’s a lot less impact of gender inequalities on this campus than maybe in other people’s lives, but it’s definitely something that both of us are aware of,” Kelley said. “In many ways, a lot of it is more social than institutional.”
Riordan agreed, citing the university’s dating environment as an example.
“I think you see it in our hookup culture,” Riordan said. “I think there is definitely a lot of negative stuff said about girls who actively participate in hookup culture. There’s a lot of slut shaming. [There’s] the fact that our sexual assault statistics match national averages.”
Additionally, “Feminists-at-Large”tries to engage as many perspectives and subject areas as possible, inviting both women and men to contribute.
Johan Clarke (COL ’15), who writes about pop culture on the blog, stressed the value of involving a variety of people in the discussion.
“I think it’s important because there are a lot of people who have a lot to say, and there are a lot of different voices and I feel like this blog brings them all together,” Clarke said. “Everyone who wants to say something can.”
“Take this gender lens and apply it to any aspect of your life, and we’re happy to post it,” Kelley said. “We want to make feminism accessible to everyone, regardless of their political background or whatever experiences they’re coming from.”
Victoria Moroney (SFS ’15) reads the blog and praised its diverse content.
“I’m glad that the authors are working to make feminism accessible to [people of] all demographics — especially ones that normally would not be included in these kinds of discussions,” Moroney said.

Pro-life advocate Helen Alvaré opened a discussion of ideology and best practices at the Cardinal O’Connor Conference on Life in Gaston Hall Saturday.
The conference attracted about 650 students and advocates from across the country who were already in Washington, D.C, for the March for Life, which took place the previous day.
Co-sponsored by GU Right to Life, GU Knights of Columbus and GU Catholic Daughters of the Americas, the conference was founded in 2000 to educate and promote dialogue about abortion, the death penalty and other life issues.
“The conference is really a Georgetown conference, and we’re proud because we’re able to use the Jesuit values that we have at this university to establish discussion and to focus on the intellectual and academic roots of the pro-life movement,” Conference Co-Director Kevin Sullivan (SFS ’14) said.
Although other conferences, such as the Students for Life of America Conference, focus on similar topics, Sullivan said that this conference’s focus on dialogue, discussion and education makes it unique.
“We really want to understand why we’re pro-life and understand how to discuss with others the academic and intellectual roots of why the pro-life movement is morally just and important for the country,” Sullivan said.
Alvaré, associate professor of law at George Mason University, ABC News consultantand adviser to Pope Benedict XVI’s Pontifical Council for the Laity,described the historic, legal, religious and medical background of abortion before addressing counterarguments from the pro-choice movement and offering a plan of action for the pro-life movement.
According to Alvaré, women who are careless about preventing pregnancy are partly to blame for the rampancy of abortions in the United States.
“Women used abortion as backup for contraceptives,” Alvaré said. “They were bold about it.”
Alvaré also said that modern medical advances have ended the need for abortion when the life of the mother is at risk.
“You don’t see that almost at all anymore,” Alvaré said. “You don’t get into that situation.”
Alvaré argued that one of the root causes of abortion is the deterioration of traditional dating and marriage practices, causing many people wait longer to get married and start a family. She said that many activities are more fun for a woman with a husband and child, adding that she disagreed with arguments that that abortion is part of a woman’s freedom of choice.
“Being alone isn’t the definition of women’s freedom,” Alvaré said. “You are taking what used to be a crime and turning it into a right. Calling it a right is a serious human rights problem.”
Alvaré also blamed the widespread use of contraceptives for a recent spike in extramarital sex that often starts at a younger age and with a growing number of partners.
“People think sex is risk-free. Sex is not tennis,” Alvaré said. “It is not something a man and woman might do for fun.”
Alvaré encouraged the audience to become involved in the pro-life cause because while it can be challenging, it can also be rewarding.
“I am still pretty cheerful about this work,” Alvaré said. “It is about loving people.”
Hospitality Coordinator Louis Cona (COL ’15) took the messages of the conference to heart.
“This is a Georgetown tradition,” Cona said. “It sets a good example for other young people. I think [Alvaré] is a great example of what the conference stands for. She serves as motivation for us all.”
Sullivan agreed, citing his own personal experiences.
“I’m adopted … and the doctors told my mother that she was a young, single mother, she was scared and an abortion was an easy option for her,” Sullivan said. “She chose not to, and now I’m blessed to be at Georgetown, participating in a national discussion and getting an education.”

Students of Georgetown, Inc. founded Corp Ink, a campus printing service, in December 2011. Now, The Corp has expanded the service to include T-shirt design and video production targeted toward student groups on the Hilltop.
According to Corp Ink Director Ian Lundy (MSB ’15), these sectors of Corp Ink are a consolidation of three formerly internal Corp services: high-quality printing and video production from Corp Marketing and Corp T-shirt Art Graphics, or “Corp TAG.”
In 2011, The Corp first made these services available to the public, but combined them within Corp Ink this year.
Along with providing printing services, Corp Ink also employs a design team that helps student groups with organizational branding. Director of Printing Christopher Kennedy (NHS ’14) said that the company is looking for opportunities to expand its services.
“We’re open to any idea as long as it falls in this general category,” Kennedy said. “Our hope is that we will be the first [choice] — over Kinko’s, for example — for student groups to do their printing.”
Part of that expansion strategy involves cutting the turnaround time for orders. While this time is currently at three days for posters and flyers and 10 days for banners, The Corp is aiming to cut down this production period as the business develops more streamlined practices.
“Right now, we’re still in an analysis phase [of] understanding our pricing and product range,” Lundysaid. “We are trying to figure out the most economical way to serve the students.”
Corp Ink is the organization’s first new business to open since Corp Catering, which launched in 2008. The Corp previously operated a photo-printing service, Full Exposure, which began in 2000, but closed within four years because of the rising popularity of digital photography.
Despite its small number of staffers, Corp Ink has already begun to find business among the campus community. The service produced flyers, invitations, programs and video content for Rangila in November.
Rangila Co-Chair Neha Sobti (COL ’13) said she was pleased with Corp Ink’s service.
“It turned out to be a great contract and partnership, and it was also really important to help out another student organization,” Sobti said. “We wanted to work with on-campus groups as much as possible.”
Corp Ink is not limited to student group usage, although individuals who purchase the service must meet a minimum quantity for their order.
Lundy said he hopes Corp Ink can develop into an “obvious go-to” for student groups.
“In five years I want us to be serving half of the organizations on campus,” he said.

About 6,000 protesters rallied on the National Mall for the March on Washington for Gun Control to demand greater restrictions to the access of deadly firearms Jan. 26.
The event began with remarks from politicians and celebrities from across the country, including Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.). Colin Goddard, a survivor of the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, also spoke.
Marchers then walked in silence from the Capitol Reflecting Pool to the Washington Monument while carrying signs bearing names of gun violence victims.
Among the marchers were D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray and residents of Newtown, Conn., along with several Georgetown students.
“I came in thinking it was a march to get rid of the Second Amendment completely but left realizing [that] the aim of the march was revision — getting rid of bullets that shatter when they enter the body [and] having background checks,” Taylor Wolfe (COL ’16), who participated in the march, said.
Wolfe indicated that the event had left her hopeful for reform.
“The majority of Americans support some kind of gun control, so I’m optimistic for [the future]. The majority of Americans want change,” Wolfe said.
According to Georgetown University College Democrats Communications Director Chris Kraft (SFS ’15), the College Dems are planning upcoming events advocating increased gun control.
“There’s a broad recognition across campus about the fact that the current system isn’t working and we need more stringent regulations,” Kraft said. “We’re very supportive of the measures that President Obama announced.”
However, College Republicans Chair Alex Cave (COL ’15) disagreed with Kraft’s assertion that Georgetown students believe increased gun control alone will reduce violence.
“It would not be accurate to generalize to the point of saying that the typical Georgetown student holds a particular position on gun rights,” Cave said. “We need a national conversation on violence, and gun rights are obviously a valid part of that conversation. … I think there’s plenty of common ground to be had, particularly with regard to background checks and stricter enforcement of existing gun laws.”

President Obama announced the selection of Georgetown alumnus Denis McDonough on Jan. 25 to serve as his fifth White House chief of staff.
As the position does not require Senate confirmation, McDonough (G ’96) assumed the position immediately following the president’s announcement.
The appointment of McDonough, 43, who previously was deputy national security adviser and worked on both Obama campaigns, follows the president’s pattern of filling key positions with close confidants.
“President Obama wants people [who] he feels very comfortable with — his inner circle,” said Lynn Ross, who has served in the Executive Office of the President in the Office of Management and Budget and is currently a visiting assistant professor at Georgetown’s Public Policy Institute. “He’s signaling that his relationships and personal trust and comfort level with his key advisers are really going to be paramount in his second term.”
Multiple news outlets, including The New York Times, have reported that Georgetown professor Ronald Klain (COL ’83) was on Obama’s short list to fill the post. Klain, who served as chief of staff for Vice Presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden, declined to comment on whether he had discussed the position with Obama or White House officials.
Klain expressed confidence in McDonough’s appointment.
“Denis is wise, strategic and a superb manager of people and processes,” Klain wrote in an email. “He has the president’s confidence and the respect of key administration officials. He understands Capitol Hill and how to get things done. And he is a great person who is well-liked and well-regarded by his White House colleagues.”
McDonough replaces Jack Lew (LAW ’83), who has been nominated by the president for Treasury secretary. No date has been set for Lew’s confirmation hearing.
The chief of staff is the highest-ranking White House employee and plays both a managerial and an advisory role.
“The chief of staff has to be a political antenna for the president,” government professor Stephen Wayne said. “He’s got to run the White House and get the trains out on time, but he [also] has to understand what’s going on in the Washington community and be a link.”
According to Ross, “The chief of staff is, I think, frankly, the second-most powerful job in Washington, next to the president.”
Obama described McDonough as one of his closest and most trusted advisers.
“Given his humility, I don’t think people always appreciate the breadth of his experience and the range of his talents,” Obama said in a statement. “And it’s precisely because of that intellect, that experience, his dedication, his determination, that I wanted Denis in this job.”
Time will tell what type of managerial style McDonough will bring to his new post.
“Obama is a delegator,” Wayne said. “He’s a big-picture, big-decision-maker kind of guy, but he leaves a lot of the details to others. Jack Lew was very good at that. … We’ll see what McDonough is very good at.”
Based on her initial impression of McDonough, Ross believes that that he will be less concerned with exercising control over the staff and will focus more on fostering communication. “[McDonough is] probably the kind of person that wants to foster collaboration for the president and give the president information about decisions that he has to make.”
Ross also believes that McDonough’s appointment is an early indicator of the president’s commitment to the ambitious agenda that he put forth in his second inaugural address.
“We naturally start most endeavors being idealistic,” Ross said. “[Obama] had great, smart people in his cabinet before, but I think in many ways it was more symbolic — in a good way — and now he’s become more pragmatic. He wants to be really productive in his second term.”
Georgetown administrators expressed enthusiasm about the appointment.
“We are truly excited that MSFS alum Denis McDonough has been selected by the President to serve as White House chief of staff,” professor Anthony Clark Arend (SFS ’80), director of Georgetown’s MSFS program, wrote in an email. “The goal of MSFS is to prepare its graduates to be creative leaders with an understanding of the ethical dimension of international affairs and a commitment to service. Denis’s work on the Hill and [in] the White House demonstrates that he is indeed this kind of creative leader.”
McDonough is the fourth Georgetown alumnus to serve as White House chief of staff. In addition to Lew, Jim Jones (LAW ’64) served as chief of staff to President Lyndon Johnson and John Podesta (LAW ’76) worked under President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68).

The GUSA senate passed a resolution Jan. 20 urging the university to expunge records of Class A violations committed during freshman year for students who do not receive additional citations in the following three semesters.
Under current policy, the university expunges students’ disciplinary records of all categories upon their graduation.
Class A violations, which include possession or consumption of alcohol, disorderly conduct, possession of drug paraphernalia or a fake ID and failure to comply with university officials, are considered the least serious in the Code of Student Conduct. The resolution focuses on consumption of alcohol and noise violations, which are the most common Class A violations. It cites administrators’ efforts to make campus the nexus of social life as part of the 2010 Campus Plan, the educational value of disciplinary experiences for first-year students and requests from employers to see disciplinary records as three main reasons to alter the current disciplinary review system.
According to GUSA senator and Honor Council Executive Committee member Tim Rosenberger(COL ’16), the Undergraduate Honor Council already has a sanction reduction program whereby students whose proposals are approvedwill have their record expunged two years after the end of the semester during which they violated the Honor System.
“I think disciplinary actions should be compared to our Honor Council,” Rosenberger said. “Our Honor Council has a sanction system that is almost identical to this. It’s a wonderful program that many people have learned from.”
Georgetown University Student Association Vice Speaker Zach Singer (SFS ’15), who sponsored the bill, pointed out that the opportunity for students to expunge disciplinary records would provide an incentive not to commit future violations.
“I know that freshmen make a lot of mistakes,”Singer said. “Many get in trouble on their first week on campus and have that hanging over their heads for the next fouryears. If there’s this incentive to be good, to not drink or be noisy on weekend or weekday nights, to not commit further violations, I think people will be more likely not to do it [again].”
Student Advocacy Office senior advocate Constantine Petallides (SFS ’13) agreed that the suggested policy revision would provide students with an incentive to alter their behavior, but expressed reservations about the actual effect of the proposed bill.
“I think it’s a great experiment because the way things have been goingright now, we’ve had the system where it stays with you forever and then the next offense will always be worse, disciplinary-wise,” Petallides said.“It candefinitely spark some people to change … [but] will it work? Only time will tell. Freshmen will be freshmen, but it is definitely worth the experiment.”
The majority of the debate on the bill among GUSA members centered on if Singer’s argument that minor disciplinary records from a student’s freshman year would affect his or her application to graduate schools and jobs is valid.
“I want to have a part of a forgiving educational system, where if law or medical schools ask for the records, it would not harm the student,” Singer said.
However, GUSA senator Abby Cooner (SFS ’16) questioned if disciplinary records play a significant role on a student’s resume.
“I think there is merit to this idea, but I’m not sure, if this were implemented, whether a noise violation in freshman year would be a big difference in the job market anyway,” Cooner said.
GUSA senator BenMishkin(SFS ’13), who voted against the resolution, agreed with Cooner that he has not heard of incidents in which students are turned down by employers due to disciplinary records.
“If you’re applying for a job, your freshman-year drinking shouldn’t make a difference and I haven’t heard that as a problem. In principle, I don’t see why we’re allowing this,” Mishkin said.
Mishkin suggested that further research to prove if disciplinary records have substantially affected job opportunities should be conducted before the bill is seriously considered by students or the administration.
“If we want to be taken seriously, we should take the time to withdraw the bill and do more research to demonstrate there are incidents where an employer says to a student, ‘You were drinking in your freshmen year, so you’re out,’” Mishkin said.
Petallides also pointed out that the resolution will likely require more concrete research before it can be brought to administrators.
“I think it’s an aspirational bill. I think this is a great year of change and experimenting in the disciplinary process. But this one, as it is written right now, may be a bit of a reach. It’s definitely a good idea, it’s definitely something to be explored, but it may need some work if something is actually going to come of it,” Petallides said.

Hema Khan, program attorney for the Stalking Resource Center at the National Center for Victims of Crime, gave a presentation to the Georgetown community about stalking behavior Monday evening.
Khan, an expert on stalking law, said that she aims to improve victims’ safety and well-being and to strengthen the mechanisms for holding perpetrators accountable.
“We have a duty to educate and spread awareness as much as we can in order to get a better understanding of what this crime is,” Khan said. “There is a lot of misunderstanding about what exactly is stalking behavior.”
According to Khan, although stalking is a crime in every state, each jurisdiction has a different definition for it. To clarify the term, the National Center for Victims of Crime has a working definition of “a pattern of behavior directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear.”
“One incident is not enough to be considered stalking,” Khan said. “It is a course of conduct, repeated again and again over a course of time, usually two or more under most state statues.”
The most frequent form of stalking is unwanted phone calls and messages, Khan said. Regardless, stalking can consist of surveillance, vandalism and identity theft, among many other forms.
Although men are occasionally victims of stalking, women under 25 are by far the most targeted group. According to a 2010 Center for Disease Control study, one in six women is stalked at some point in her lifetime. The report also found a high incidence of stalking in the LGBTQ community.
Stalkers are most often males and current or former intimate partners of their victims who resort to stalking because they have an obsessive need for control or are unable to accept rejection, Khan said. There is also a considerable incidence of mental illness among perpetrators.
Khan added that popular culture and discourse tend to portray stalking as a romantic or funny gesture.
“Society maybe presents stalking as something that is socially acceptable,” Khan said. “There are movies like ‘[The] Cable Guy’ with [Jim Carrey] or songs like ‘Paparazzi’ by Lady Gaga. … Why is it that we use stalking so freely as a term? I mean who hasn’t heard somebody use the term ‘Facebook stalking’ in the past month? When we use the term so freely, so casually, it minimizes it. What people need to realize is that this is a very serious, illegal crime.”
Khan told students that whether they have been victims of stalking or know friends who have been victimized, the best thing they can do is take advantage of resources on campus and in the city.
Director of the Women’s Center Laura Kovach said that, in the past few years Georgetown has made a push toward promoting awareness about the stalking problem on campus.
“Our strategy here has been empowering and addressing our community as one of bystanders rather than [of] potential victims or perpetrators,” Kovach said.
She also said that there are nonprofit groups in D.C. that provide resources to victims.
Students were surprised by some aspects of Khan’s speech.
“I thought it was really informative about something that people don’t give a lot of attention to but is experienced by so many of us,” Scott Ruona (MSB ’15) said. “It was nice to give what behaviors exactly constitute stalking some thought and be presented with some ways … to effectively address them both psychologically and culturally.”
Eric Nevalsky (SFS ’16), who occasionally works with stalking victims at the LGBTQ Resource Center, agreed.
“The most interesting thing for me was learning about all the ways you could engage in stalking, [like] sending gifts,” Nevalsky said. “I’d never thought something like that would be considered stalking and that it only takes a few instances for the behavior to be classified as such. It seems to me that stalking in the media is usually talked about over much broader time periods, like over years and years.”
Nevalsky said that he would incorporate what he learned into his work with stalking victims.
“Also, I have a little sister, and I want to watch out for her,” Nevalsky said. “We all have a responsibility to be aware of bystanders when it comes to things as serious as this.”
