Georgetown College’s new minor in journalism, which was approved by the Executive Curriculum Committee in January, is now accepting applications for its first crop of students.
The minor will require six classes, including “Introduction to Journalism,” “Digital News,” “Media Techniques,” a Journalism Capstone and two electives.
Although the minor is hot off the press, classes focusing on journalism have been offered through the English department for years. Barbara Feinman Todd, current director of the university’s journalism program, is leading the new minor.
“I think it’s important because there’s a huge interest in journalism and a desire by the students to have a formal program,” she said.
According to Feinman Todd, the journalism minor is long overdue.
“I wanted this to happen for a long time,” she said. “Georgetown is the perfect place for journalism.”
Chester Gillis, dean of Georgetown College, said the absence of a journalism minor may have kept students from choosing to attend Georgetown in the past.
“It fits well with what we do,” he said. “I’ve had students who were accepted at multiple universities … but wanted this piece of the curriculum. And now that we have it, they’ll come.”
The application deadline for the minor is March 15, and acceptance results will be released beforepreregistration for the fall semester.
Some students interested in the minor were surprised to learn that such a program had not been previously implemented.
“Considering that [Georgetown has] majors like medieval studies, and minors like Russian literature and culture, the idea that Georgetown neglected training in such an essential facet of human culture and society — the art of communication — was mind-blowing,” Lindsey Turner (COL ’14) wrote in an email.
According to Feinman Todd, although the program targets sophomores, some juniors who have taken the requisite courses will also be eligible to apply. She will hold an information session about the new program Feb. 24.

While segments of D.C.’s new streetcar system are expected to become operational by 2013, it is unlikely that routes will ever be expanded to Georgetown.
According to John Lisle, a spokesman for the District Department of Transportation, the ongoing project to restore 150-year-old streetcar tracks on O and P Streets in Georgetown will serve purely historic purposes.
“The tracks we have on O and P Streets can’t be used again. … They’re really there because of their historical value,” he said. “I’d be very surprised if we tried to run a streetcar down O or P Streets like we didbefore.”
The new tracks being installed in other parts of the city are part of a scheme to build up to eight streetcar lines with 37 miles of track. Proposed segments include a route along the H Street-Benning Road corridor in Northeast, a K Street transitway and a corridor between Adams Morgan and Congress Heights.
All of the projects currently underway use new track because it is more cost effective than rehabilitating tracks left over from D.C.’s old streetcar system, which ceased operations in 1952.
Though Georgetown will not benefit from the project, DDOT hopes that the streetcars will provide other neighborhoods without Metro stations improved access to the rest of the city.
“We want to provide more transit options for people to better connect neighborhoods, connect people to their jobs and fill in the gaps in the metro system,” Lisle said.
The H Street-Benning Road corridor, which is due to be operational by summer 2013, will be the first of the new routes, although Lisle cautioned that several steps still remain in the project.
“A lot is still happening to get that lined up,” he said.
Lisle added that streetcars are a useful alternative because they are less disruptive to install than underground rail networks but more permanent than buses.
“[Streetcars] have been shown to have more economic development impact than buses because they’re more permanent,” he said.
Lisle expressed enthusiasm about the return of streetcars to the District.
“We wish the [old] service had never stopped,” he said.

The Department of Public Safety is investigating a string of five thefts and burglaries of items totaling nearly $1,500 from buildings at the Georgetown University Medical Center.
The incidents occurred over a two-day period starting Jan. 26. DPS Associate Director Joseph Smith declined to comment on whether the incidents are connected but confirmed that an investigation is ongoing.
The first two incidents took place at the New Research Building on Jan. 26. Video footage from a surveillance camera showed a man stealing a computer, a computer monitor and a scanner from an open loading dock at 2:25 p.m.  The suspect then loaded the equipment into a white, four-door Toyota Corolla that was parked outside the dock. The total value of the stolen equipment was estimated at $300 but could be as much as $900, according to a Metropolitan Police Department report.
The report describes the suspect as a 35- to 40-year-old black male, about 5-foot-10 and weighing 200 pounds. He was dressed in a black jacket and a blue hat with gray pants and a gray shirt.
A little more than two hours later, a suspect of the same description and an accomplice, who was not described in the MPD report, took two freezers from the same loading dock and loaded them into a white Dodge pickup truck.
Three more offices were burglarized the following day.
At 5:30 p.m. on Jan. 27, an unknown suspect broke into an office on the fourth floor of the Medical-Dental Building and stole a $700 safe. The professor who reported the burglary is licensed to possess controlled substances, including cocaine and morphine, for research purposes. He reported to MPD that the safe was usually used to store those drugs, though it was empty at the time of the burglary.
Another office on the fourth floor of Building D was broken into around the same time.  Though nothing was reported stolen, a desk drawer was broken when the burglar forced it open.
Fifty minutes after the first two burglaries, $235 was stolen from a safe in an office on the second floor of the same building.
No description is available for the suspects involved in any of the Jan. 27 incidents.

For most children, college is at most a vague, unfamiliar concept. But for the children of the faculty- and chaplains-in-residence at Georgetown, this college campus is a warm home.
About 13 children live in student housing on campus as part of the faculty-in-residence and chaplain-in-residence programs. For them, the university is not an institution of higher learning, but a place where they can explore, play and learn.
 
WORK HARD, PLAY HARD
 
Tad Howard, associate dean of Georgetown College, moved on campus with his wife, Susan, in 2007. Their son, Grady, now almost 3, was born at the Georgetown University Hospital and has known no other home than Kennedy Hall.
“I try to get in his imagination, and I think he believes that the whole campus is his yard. So we open up the front door and he’s looking at the football field, and there are people playing sports on his yard,” Howard said.
Students often see Howard and his son frequenting Grady’s favorite places, such as the fishpond next to the White-Gravenor or the fountain in the Dahlgren Quadrangle.
For Maya Roth, the director of theater and performance studies, the greatest benefit of living on campus is the proximity between her workplace and her home. She and her husband, Bill, raise their son, Yul, in LXR Hall. While Roth is at work, Yul spends his days at the nearby Hoya Kids Learning Center, a daycare and preschool facility for children of Georgetown students, faculty and staff.
“It’s just great to walk to work and take Yul to school and pick him up and have that kind of integrated path,” Roth said. “One of the things I love and I think my students love is that my worlds overlap a bit.”
 
KEEPING THE PEACE
 
While university neighbors may complain about rowdy undergraduates, and students may gripe about a lack of social space, parents on campus have few complaints.
While university dorms are not necessarily as spacious as private residences, Howard and his family have been very happy living in Kennedy Hall.
“We’re not exactly near a Babies-R-Us, but then that could be true if we lived in a neighborhood as well,” he said.
Andy Staron, chaplain-in-residence in Henle Village and a professor in the theology department, said he and his wife, Andrea, don’t usually find the noisy campus setting to be a challenge, even when putting their 2-year-old A.J. and 6-month-old Lucia to bed at an early hour.
“Students are pretty considerate when they’re sober,” Staron said. “No one wants to be the jerk who woke up the baby.”
Staron and Roth noted the lack of a typical neighborhood environment and readily available playmates as potential downsides to raising their children on campus.
“The one thing we’re lacking here is a neighborhood, you know, with kids down the street,” Staron said. “But especially over the last couple years, there has been an increase in kids [on campus], so now there are a good number of kids and it’s a lot of fun.”
 
BLOSSOMING RELATIONSHIPS
 
Howard estimates that there is an event for all of the children living on campus about once per semester that allows them to get together and interact with other families.
In October, chaplains-in-residence in Kennedy Hall organized a Halloween party in the Kennedy multi-purpose room, and about a dozen children attended in full costume.
Howard said Georgetown offers a unique sense of community for his family and credits Grady’s social nature to the many opportunities he has to interact with students and faculty on a daily basis.
He added that the ready supply of babysitters is convenient.
“Our friends who don’t live on campus are insanely jealous of that. And it’s wonderful, because it’s not just that they’re easy to find, but that we know who we’re getting and that [Grady will] be loved. We don’t have to worry. That is such a blessing,” Howard said.
For many parents, the importance of interactions between their children and the students they work with has been surprising.
“I didn’t anticipate how important Yul was going to be in my life as a faculty-in-residence,” Roth said. “There are certainly students whom I know he has navigated my relationship with. They might not seek me out if it weren’t for him, but he facilitates interaction.”
Ciara Foldenauer (COL ’14), a resident of Henle Village, enjoys seeing A.J. playing on his scooter and having the opportunity to interact with the Staron family.
“I think it really gives a lot to the college experience, and I think it’s one of the best aspects of residence life,” she said. “You know, when you’re on a college campus you don’t get to see many old people or children or families, so it’s really nice to have a family living close by.”
For Staron, having children on campus adds to the overall sense of community at Georgetown.
“I had an old buddy who said college campuses could stand to have more dogs and babies,” Staron said. “It humanizes the place a little bit.”

Emmanuel Kornyo, former chaplain-in-residence for the third floor of New South Hall, will not return to his position or live on campus after his alleged involvement in an incident of family disturbance Wednesday night.
“These matters are sensitive and appropriate steps are being taken,” Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh wrote in an email.
Kornyo and his wife, Rebecca, had a verbal dispute at around 10:50 p.m. Wednesday. According to a report from the Department of Public Safety, a student called DPS after hearing the couple fighting.
The initial DPS report classified the incident as domestic violence and said that one of the parties was transported to the Georgetown University Hospital for minor injuries.
The Metropolitan Police Department reported, however, that there was no physical evidence of an assault and no charges were pressed against either party.
James Lorello, hall director for New South, sent an email to residents of the third floor Thursday afternoon to inform them that their chaplain would be absent from the floor for the time being.
“The situation has been taken care of and everything is fine,” he wrote. “I apologize that I cannot give more details about this incident, but you can trust that everything has been dealt with.”
Lorello told The Hoya that the incident Wednesday was not deemed to have endangered or negatively impacted students in any way. In his email to students he urged residents to contact Assistant Director of Residence Life Katie Heather or Laura Kovach, director of the Women’s Center, if they still have concerns.
