Nearly 27 years after graduating from Georgetown, Representative-elect Filemon Vela (COL ’85) will return to Washington this January to represent Texas’ newly created 34th Congressional District.
Vela (D-Texas) is one of 14 Georgetown alumni to be elected to the House in the Nov. 6 election — nine are returning incumbents, while Vela and four others are new to Congress.
Vela has spent the two decades since his graduation as an attorney. He has represented many individuals in civil cases against large corporations, including Robert Trevino v. Walmart, in which Hispanic farm workers brought suit against Walmart after they were banned from a Mississippi store because other Hispanics had previously stolen from it.
“As a litigator, each case is a new story and also allows you to connect to your individual client. And many times, my clients are people who have suffered devastating injury,” he said. “Each experience has been a building block.”
For Vela, getting to Washington was not easy. He faced seven other candidates in the primary election, where he received 40 percent of the vote. In Texas, Democratic candidates need a majority of the vote to receive the nomination, so a run-off primary was held in July. Vela defeated his challenger in the run-off and then in the general election, winning his district with 62 percent of the vote. Now, after a year on the campaign trail, Vela is ready to take office.
“The prospect of serving in Congress is very engaging. I take it very seriously. It’s going to be a lot of work, but I am hoping it’s going to be a lot of fun, too,” he said.
While Vela has never previously held political office, public service is a tradition in his family. His father, Filemon Vela Sr., was a U.S. District Court judge for the Southern District of Texas. Vela’s mother, Blanca Vela, was the mayor of Brownsville, Texas, the city where Vela grew up.
Reflecting on the lessons he learned at Georgetown, Vela said that the late professor of government Walter Giles (SFS ’43, GRD ’45), who was assigned as Vela’s faculty mentor, was a significant influence.
“He taught me a lot about how government works. He trained those of us who wanted to go into the field of law very well,” he said.
Outside of class, Vela and Giles bonded over basketball games, where Giles often took his mentees.
“It was an exciting time to be here,” Vela said, referring to the Hoyas’ victory in the 1984 NCAA tournament.
Vela has also remained close with his former housemates and said they were among the first to call and congratulate him on Election Night.
“I learned the lasting value of friendship with the friends that I made here,” Vela said.
When Vela officially begins to serve on Capitol Hill this January, he is confident that can work across the partisan aisle. Although Vela ran for office as a Democrat, his wife Rose, who serves as a judge on Texas’ 13th Court of Appeals, is a Republican.
“We’ve told people during the last nine months [that] if I can live and be married with one for 22 years, I can work with them in Washington,” he said. “I don’t view party labels as restricting me from developing friendships and engaging in dialogue.”
According to Vela, bipartisan cooperation is necessary if Congress is to address the nation’s looming fiscal cliff.
”The one thing everybody can agree on is that if Congress doesn’t begin to work together to fix the consequences of the fiscal cliff, we may be set right back into recession,” he said. “The inability of Congress to work together in the past, ironically, has put us in a situation where we have no choice but to work together to avoid a recessionary crisis.”
In addition to working to solve the nation’s fiscal woes, Vela plans to advocate for issues that are of direct concern to his constituents back home — namely immigration reform and border security.
Vela’s congressional district stretches along Texas’ Gulf Coast and runs from Corpus Christi to Brownsville, which is located just north of the U.S.-Mexico border. According to Vela, Mexican drug cartels have a significant presence across the border and the area is prone to conflict. He hopes to establish border security that protects the people of Brownsville from the violence while maintaining a strong relationship with Mexico.
“It’s important to address immigration and border security, but we can’t lose sight of the fact that Mexico is one of our largest trading partners, and, in the long run, improving the economy of both of our countries helps [them] become economically viable,” Vela said.
Vela also hopes to address the issue of immigration during his term.
“We need to take the president’s directive in the DREAM Act and turn it into law and come up with some sort of comprehensive immigration reform,” he said. “I would hope that most Texas Republicans would agree that we need … turn it into law and come up with some sort of comprehensive immigration reform to the likes of what … former President Bush set forth when he was president.”
This is the first of a three-part feature series on Georgetown alumni newly elected to Congress. The next installment will be published Friday, Nov. 30.

Wardah Athar (COL ’13) was named a recipient of the George J. Mitchell Scholarship, an award that provides for a year of graduate study at a university in Ireland, Monday.
The scholarship is named for former Sen. George J. Mitchell (D-Maine) who helped broker peace in Northern Ireland in the 1990s.
Mitchell Scholars must be between 18 and 30 years old. Georgetown has produced 14 Mitchell Scholars since the program’s inception in 2000. This year, 12 scholars were chosen from a pool of nearly 300 applicants.
Athar, a neurobiology major, will study neuroscience at Trinity College Dublin.
Athar’s academic interests reflect a shift in interests of Mitchell Scholarship applicants and recipients, according to president of the US-Ireland Alliance and founder of the scholarship Trina Vargo.
“When the program was first created, the vast majority of applicants were interested in conflict resolution and the arts. While those areas remain popular, we have also seen a steady increase in interest in the life sciences, math and finance. Irish universities are conducting cutting-edge research in these areas that is being recognized in the [United States],” Vargo wrote in a press release.
Athar expressed her gratitude and excitement about winning this award.
“I’m really humbled, really grateful and super excited to be part of such an amazing community,” she said. “The other [scholars] are incredibly intelligent and down to earth, and I’m excited to learn from them and learn from the program.”

The final New South Student Center forum in Bulldog Alley Thursday included discussions between students, administrators and architects as the university looks to finalize plans for the renovation.
ikon.5 architect Joe Tattoni presented diagrams of the NSSC to a crowd of approximately 40 people.
Tattoni’s designs for the NSSC included a general lobby area and a variety of student assembly, study and lounge areas. He also confirmed that Dining Services will run a pub-style restaurant, tentatively named Healy Pub, and that Students of Georgetown, Inc. plans to open a made-to-order salad and smoothie shop.
“We’re at a schematic level in the design,” Tattoni said. ”It’s a balancing of aspiration, cost and schedule. You’re seeing a snapshot of a work in progress.”
Tattoni added that many ideas proposed by students at previous forum events have been incorporated into the design plans, including additional TVs and power stations.
In response to student and faculty concerns, he emphasized that Healy Pub will not disrupt students studying in the center and living in New South.
“All the things that were talked about were accommodated,” Tattoni said.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said that although the event was advertised as the final student forum on the NSSC, students will have future opportunities to voice their opinions. Georgetown University Student Association Senate Vice Speaker Zach Singer (SFS ’15) and representative Alex Freeman (COL ’14) have been involved in the project as student members of the NSSC Committee.
“[The NSCC] is going to be such a core part of campus for the next 20 years,” Singer said. “The university is really committed to making this building the heart of student life on campus, and from being on the committee you can really see that.”
Singer said he thought students were impressed by the designs they saw at the forum.
“The plans that we showed tonight demonstrated that we have a somewhat concrete, feasible idea right now,” he said. “The designs aren’t finalized and the pictures aren’t necessarily what it’s going to end up being, but the idea, the sentiment of the building is strong. The students seemed to really get the space.”
Some students, however, were worried about space issues.
“There’s some concern about what space will be left for dance,” said Rachel Rodgers (SFS ’16), a ballet student and member of the Black Movements Dance Theatre. Other groups whose space may be jeopardized include the Tae Kwon Do club and Georgetown University Dance Company.
“It’s true that we’re space constrained now and that we’ll add new space and still be space constrained,” Director of Student Affairs Erika Cohen-Derr said. “But this is adding some additional meeting spaces … students will get priority and perhaps exclusive use of these spaces.”
Olson emphasized that though available square footage may decrease, the university will work to accommodate student needs.
“That whole floor is designed for students — that’s the whole idea,” Olson said. “The space will definitely be reservable.”
Student Activities Commission member Dan Silkman (COL ‘15) had a more positive outlook.
“I’ve been really interested in seeing how it will advance our student experience,” he said. “It’ll be nice to see a dedicated space on campus for students to gather that isn’t Lau Two.”

After delaying its early action deadline by a week in the midst of Hurricane Sandy, Georgetown saw a record number of early applications this admissions cycle, with 37 more applicants than last year.
This year, 6,736 students applied for early action admission to the class of 2017, marking a slight increase over the 6,699 applicants who applied last year. Most notably, the School of Nursing and Health Studies saw a 20 percent jump in applications.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (CAS ’64,GRD ’69) cautioned that those numbers are not final.
“These numbers will change based on some who are allowed to apply late from Sandy-affected areas,” he said.
Consistent with a trend seen in past years, the largest number of early action applications was for the College, which received a total of 3,855 applicants. The Walsh School of Foreign Service and McDonough School of Business received 1,337 and 1,196 applicants, respectively. The smallest number of students applied to the School of Nursing and Health Studies, which received 527 applications.
Despite the overall increase, applications to the College were down by 5 percent this year, while applications to the SFS remained about the same. The MSB, however, saw an increase in early applicants, with 12 percent more students applying early.
According to Dean Deacon, these increases are consistent with national trends toward pre-professional programs.
“This continues a trend over the last several years of students increasingly applying to programs where they feel there is more job security,” he said.
According to Deacon, while the distribution of applicants across schools continues to shift, the quality of applicants remains steady. This year’s pool of applicants had average SAT and ACT scores that were almost unchanged from last year.
The geographic distribution of applications also remained consistent. The largest number of applicants this cycle was from California, with 664 applicants. New York had the second-highest number of applicants, with 617, and New Jersey contributed the third-most, with 598 applications.
The 518 international early applicants this cycle represent a 12 percent jump over last year’s. According to Deacon, this increase is probably the result of the larger number of students from Asia applying to schools in the United States rather than any active recruiting efforts on the part of the university.
“The international numbers just keep rising due, probably, to the momentum of students, particularly from Asia, applying to U.S. colleges. We do visit abroad throughout the world but did nothing differently this year,” he said.
Dean Deacon anticipated admitting approximately 1,050 applicants under the early action program this year, resulting in an admission rate of around 15 percent, consistent with the class of 2016’s rate of just over 15 percent.
Georgetown’s early acceptance rate is lower in comparison to those of several peer institutions. At Harvard University 17.9 percent of early applicants were admitted last year, according to the Harvard Gazette. The University of Chicago’s acceptance rate last year was 17.6 percent and Yale’s was 15.7 percent, according to the New York Times’ Choice Blog.
This rate places Georgetown as one of the most selective universities in the nation, and Deacon feels that this will continue to hold true in the future.
According to Deacon, the university’s efforts to improve accessibility for minority students is causing application rates to rise. The number of black and Hispanic applicants increased by 12 and 7 percent over last year, respectively.
“We continue to target low-income, first-generation students who are underrepresented here at all elite colleges, and that I’m sure has helped increase the number of African-American and especially Hispanic-American students,” Deacon said.

Planning is underway for the 11th annual Let Freedom Ring Initiative, which will be held this January.
Based on the ideals championed in Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” which challenged southern clergymen who had asked him to stop advocating for civil rights and desegregation, the initiative will relate King’s activism to social justice at Georgetown.
“The theme for Georgetown is the notion of using social justice and other forms of action to give voice to many silent forms of injustice in our lives,” said Michael Smith, co-chair of the initiative and director of affirmative action programs at the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action.
The event will honor D.C. activist Mary Brown — who works to provide opportunities for local black youth — with the John Thompson, Jr. Legacy of a Dream Award, which was named for the former Georgetown men’s head basketball coach and honors people who fight for social justice.
Past recipients include basketball player Dikembe Mutombo (CAS ’91), speechwriter Clarence Jones and Children’s Defense Fund activist Marian Wright Edelman.
University President John J. DeGioia founded the Let Freedom Ring Initiative in 2003.
“DeGioia wanted members of the university community to celebrate the life and legacy of MLK in a more significant way than we had done in the past — engaging our neighbors in D.C. and our campus community in reflecting on his work and the ongoing work he inspired,” Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh said. “We’ve honored a range of international and national leaders in the past 10 years with the John Thompson, Jr. Legacy of a Dream Award.”
The initiative’s planning process began Nov. 8 with a committee meeting held in the Philodemic Room in Healy Hall. About 25 faculty, staff and students attended the meeting, the first of five spanning from now until January.
The committee is responsible for planning the celebration’s various events, which include a day of community service, a performance at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, an academic event, a spiritual service, a student, faculty and staff reflection event and a final performance event. Meeting attendees formed subcommittees to focus on each of these events.
The committee also talked about organizing a spoken word flash mob in Red Square to promote the event and to raise awareness about its “Letter from Birmingham Jail” theme.
“A lot of the stuff we plan will be based on the letter and what Dr. King wrote,” Hyun-Kyoo Jo (SFS ’13), a student who attended the meeting, said. “So, in Red Square, we were thinking about having people read off different parts of the letter out loud. It’s a way to get attention and to publicize both King’s writings and the events.”
The committee also finalized details for vocalist and songwriter Smokey Robinson, who will perform at the Kennedy Center. Past performers have included Aretha Franklin and Brian McKnight.
Britt Daniels (COL ’16), another student who attended the meeting, expressed surprise and disappointment at the low turnout at the meeting last week.
“Considering that the email about the committee meeting was a school-wide email, I was surprised that only around 25 people showed up,” Daniels said.
But Smith said that attendance of 20 to 40 people is typical for planning committee meetings. In addition, turnout for the planning committee meetings is not an indication of interest in the events. According to Smith, the Kennedy Center performance is always filled to capacity, and on-campus events average between 75 and 200 people.

Georgetown stood among the top producers of Fulbright scholars for the 2012-2013 academic year, with 14 students, faculty and staff receiving the prestigious award, according to a ranking released by The Chronicle of Higher Education on Oct. 28.
Of the 61 Georgetown students who applied for Fulbright grants last year, 23 percent were accepted. This rate ranks Georgetown the 18th-highest producer of Fulbright scholars, tied with American University and Duke University.
With 40 students receiving awards, The University of Michigan topped this year’s list, followed by Harvard University, Brown University and the University of Chicago, which sent 31, 29 and 24 students, respectively.
The Fulbright U.S. Student Program offers merit-based grants for graduating college seniors, graduate students, young professionals and artists to travel abroad and study. The grants also provide opportunities to conduct research or become an English teaching assistant for one year. The Fulbright program offers approximately 1,500 full or partial grants to Americans each year.
The number of Georgetown students that received fellowships peaked during the 2007-2008 school year, with 21 students receiving grants. This was a sharp increase from prior years. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, nine, three and seven students were selected, respectively.
From eight years ago, the number of Georgetown students to receive Fulbright grants has doubled.
According to Lauren Tuckley, the university’s associate director and Fulbright Program adviser in the Office of Fellowships, Awards and Research, Georgetown takes a special interest in coaching Fulbright applicants to success. Her office holds several information sessions and meets with each applicant one-on-one to improve their chances of being selected.
Tuckley said that this unique approach serves as both a strength and a limitation for Georgetown applicants.
“Our fellowship office is quite small compared to our peer institutions,” she said. “While we would like to grow our Fulbright numbers and continually look to improve the processes for doing so, [the] fact remains that we have only one full-time administrative fellowship advisor. As the number of Georgetown-University-endorsed Fulbright applicants continues to grow, as does interest in other fellowships we advise on, we hope that our resources can meet the burgeoning demand.”
Hanna Caldwell (SFS ’11) is one of three Georgetown alumni currently completing a Fulbright program. She says her experiences serving as a teaching assistant in an English program and coordinating a health and wellness program at a refugee camp north of in Amman, Jordan have given her an unmatched opportunity to improve her Arabic.
“I love being able to just soak up the language, whether in a taxi, a cafe or wandering the streets.
I take colloquial Arabic classes and have a private tutor for modern standard Arabic, but I learn the most outside of my formal language education here,” Caldwell wrote in an email. “The opportunity for language practice alone makes the experience of living abroad worth being so far from home.”
Caldwell added that the program has allowed her to remain intellectually stimulated in a similar way to what she experienced at Georgetown.
“I think after college when real life begins, we lose a lot of that intellectual stimulation that we probably took for granted as undergrads, and I feel like I’m getting to continue a lot of the conversations I had in college about politics and culture in the Middle East,” she said.
In addition to furthering Georgetown graduates’ learning, Fulbright programs provide a way for Georgetown’s staff to develop professionally. Sandra Layton, associate director of international student and scholar services at the Office of International Programs, spent two weeks in Korea this summer after receiving the U.S. Korea International Education Administrator Award in June.
For Layton, the fortnight spent visiting U.S. universities, a middle school and the Korean Women’s Development Institute gave her a better understanding of Korean culture and society that has helped her in her job back in D.C.
“I work with scholars coming to Georgetown to conduct research and teach, many of them from Korea,” she said. “[The program] gave me a greater understanding of Korean people, which has really helped me in my job.”
Fulbright scholars stressed that their time spent abroad has provided a welcome push beyond their comfort zones.
“Living abroad and feeling like a bit of an outsider gets me out of my comfort zone, sometimes to the point of being incredibly frustrated, but more often it makes my days really satisfying,” Caldwell said.

A delegation of 21 Georgetown students will attend the 16th annual Ignatian Family Teach-In for Justice, joining representatives from Jesuit high schools, universities, the Jesuit Volunteer Corps and the Ignatian community in Crystal City, Va., this weekend.
The first teach-in was held in 1996 after the 1989 murders of six Jesuits in El Salvador because they were advocating for human rights issues.
Since the first Ignatian Family Teach-In, the event has sought to address a diverse array of world issues that relate to the Catholic faith.
“It’s a call to action … to implement [Catholic values] at our schools,” said Jordan Denari (SFS ’13), a student who has attended the teach-ins since she was in high school.
Denari will be giving a presentation about Catholic-Muslim relations at this weekend’s event.
“It will be about the way in which we, as Catholics, are called to have discourse with the Muslim faith,” she said. “It ties into the 50th anniversary of Vatican II, which was really the first time that relations with Islam were discussed.”
Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) will also give a presentation on the Jesuit Just Employment Project, an initiative spearheaded by the Kalmanovitz Institute for Labor and the Working Poor that aims to enact policies that secure Jesuit standards of treatment — protecting workers’ rights and ensuring fair pay — for university employees.
Kohnert-Yount, who was not raised Catholic, will be attending the Ignatian Family Teach-In for the first time this year.
“If you had asked me my freshman year if I would be speaking at the Ignatian Family Teach-In, let’s just say, I would’ve been very surprised,” she said.
But Kohnert-Yount said her talk, which will use the example of the successful campaign to unionize O’Donovan Hall workers last spring, epitomizes Jesuit ideals.
“It really aligns with Georgetown’s Catholic and Jesuit identity and speaks to a lot of the values that our university, as well as other universities, hold dear,” she said.
Students who attended the event in the past said the teach-in made an impact on their lives.
“I had an amazing experience my freshman year in meeting so many different people,” Marya Pulaski (COL ’13) said. “It helped shape the rest of my years at Georgetown.”
Denari shared a similar sentiment.
“It’s great being able to spend time with those who are passionate about the same things,” she said. “Seeing their enthusiasm makes me want to re-commit myself to social justice issues.”

Of the 13 initiatives that have won ReImagine Georgetown grants in the last five years, eight are still thriving. But funding for some inactive projects have been cut for the first time, and organizers are searching for ways to increase the program’s impact.
RIG, an annual contest that awards grants to student-run initiatives, traces its origins to 2007, when the university approached Students of Georgetown, Inc., the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union and THE HOYA to start a program that would fund undergraduate student life improvements. The credit union and The Corp grant approximately $10,000 each year to fund RIG winners’ proposals, while The Hoya provides marketing and advertising.
“RIG is, for us, a way to pool our resources and get behind projects that are bigger — bigger financially, bigger in scope and we hope bigger in impact,” said Ryan Muldoon (COL ’13), chair of The Corp Philanthropy Committee and a RIG board member.
The Georgetown University Farmer’s Market, Illuminate Lauinger, Breaking the Bubble and Student Workshops at Georgetown were all established with the help of RIG grants and remain active on campus. RIG grant recipients whose projects are unsuccessful, however, risk having their funding cut — an option the RIG board exercised for the first time this year, according to GUASFCU and RIG treasurer Justin Kwan (MSB ’13).
The five accounts that RIG closed this semester — the Beautify Georgetown Project, Student Working Groups, Sustainable Garden Initiative, Saxa Service Feast and Georgetown Alternative Music Series — had been inactive for more than a year and were led by students who have since graduated without handing over access to RIG funds to their successors.
“I think that, as a whole, ReImagine Georgetown hasn’t really reached its full potential,” Kwan said. “In the past five years we’ve given out roughly $50,000 in funding, and you have great byproducts such as the Farmers’ Market and SWAG, [but] if you take a step back and look at what $50,000 means … a lot more can be done.”
Kwan said that RIG could be improved by changing the application and ensuring that there is more communication between the organization and grant winners, such as implementing a more consistent check-in process.
Still, several of RIG’s success stories have left a noticeable mark on student life.
Jack Carlson (SFS ’09) and Eric Wind (SFS ’09) received the first-ever RIG grant, which totaled $2,000, in 2007 to start the Beautify Georgetown Project, which restored works of art and architectural details in buildings around campus.
“We used the fact that we got the grant as a mandate to go speak to administrators,” Wind said. “I don’t think we would have been able to be as successful in terms of getting the administrators to pay … if we didn’t have the ReImagine Georgetown grant.”
One of the major initiatives Wind and Carlson took on was restoring the display of shields in Copley Formal Lounge, which had been falling apart. Wind estimated that the project would have cost $20,000, but the duo found an artisan who donated his time to recast the shields, reducing the cost to $2,500.
Because the group needed university approval to fix the shields, Wind and Carlson were in contact with the administration and O’Donnell eventually offered to pay.
“I think our grant was extremely successful, and the things we did should last at least a century, so we believe that future generations of Georgetown students will benefit from our work,” Wind said.
The Beautify Georgetown project only used $600 of its RIG funds in projects in Sellinger Lounge, the admissions office and other locations but did not pass on access to the funds to anyone after Wind and Carlson graduated.
The account became inactive, and RIG is now taking money from the Beautify Georgetown Project and the other inactive initiatives to fund other grants.
The Farmer’s Market, founded in Spring 2011 on a RIG grant awarded to Bre Donald (NHS ’12) and Melissa Gadsden (NHS ’12), has been a popular mainstay of Copley Lawn all semester thanks to Executive Market Director Alexa Cotcamp (MSB ’15), who took over when Donald and Gadsden graduated.
“I think the Farmer’s Market is one of the most unique things I’ve ever encountered,” Cotcamp said. “I think it really reimagines Georgetown in the chance that it gives students to really come together once every week for the simple purpose of really good, really local, awesome food.”
Melissa Riggio (COL ’14), an employee at Lauinger Library, received $1,000 from RIG last November for Illuminate Lauinger, a project that aims to revamp the interior design of the oft-criticized library. Last month, Illuminate Lauinger put up four art pieces near the writing center on the second floor of the building.
“The goal of Illuminate Lauinger was to bring more art to Lauinger and make it a place that students don’t hate going to,” Riggio said. “There’s a general joke that people don’t like Lau or despise Lau. As someone that spends a good part of the week there, I wanted to make it a place that people wouldn’t mind going to or would like going to just because of the atmosphere change.”
Student Workshops at Georgetown received $2,000 last November to provide opportunities for students and clubs to organize education workshops on topics of their choice. Past workshops have included henna, sushi making, dance and knitting.
SWAG sponsored 10 events last semester — nearly one each week — but aims to cut back on that total this year in an effort to enhance the quality and size of each workshop, according to SWAG founder Christina Cristomo (SFS ’13).
“For the students who lead the workshops, it’s a good way for them to share what they’re passionate about with the Georgetown community as well as have some experience teaching a class, which is something I think a lot of students are interested in doing but didn’t necessarily have the platform to do prior to SWAG’s existence,” Cristomo said. “For people who attend the workshops, the obvious benefit is that … it’s just a cool way to learn something new in a low-pressure environment.”
Cristomo added that SWAG aims to connect people at Georgetown who might not otherwise cross paths.
“Our greater goal is to make these connections across the community, so to have clubs that usually only have programming for people on their listserv to be able to tap into people that are interested in learning and interested in trying new things,” she said.
According to Cristomo, RIG funding was vital to her initiative.
“I think it’s one of the most accessible means of funding for ideas on campus,” she said. “It’s really fast. That’s what you need. It is literally one of the best ways to fund your idea.”
The RIG board is considering alterations to the program to improve the success rates of future grant recipients. One of the proposed changes involves making RIG friendlier to first-year students, who usually aren’t well enough established on campus by the fall application deadline to propose a winning project.
“We are going to be re-looking at the timing of the initiative,” Muldoon said. “For the last several years, it’s been a fall program. And one of the questions we have raised for discussion is … [whether] this program might be better put in the spring, when incoming freshmen and transfer students have had a chance to really establish themselves and make some of those connections that are crucial to success.”

Panelists compared modern veterans to their counterparts from the Civil War at a discussion and film screening sponsored by the Georgetown University Student Veterans Association and the Masters of Science in Foreign Service program Tuesday.
The event, titled “Lessons and Legacies: The Civil War and Veterans Today,” began with a viewing of “Death and the Civil War,” a film directed by documentarian Ric Burns.
History professor Chandra Manning moderated the panel, which was composed of National Guardsman Russell Galeti, Director of the Institute for National Security Ethics and Leadership Albert Pierce and Department of Veterans Affairs’ Assistant Secretary for Public and Intergovernmental Affairs Tommy Sowers.
The panelists first discussed the impact of the Civil War on the United States.
“We will permanently be traumatized by it,” Burns said. “Some traumas we will never get over.”
Pierce also emphasized the lasting effects of the war.
“What survives is an appreciation for the ultimate price we pay, the last full measure of devotion,” Pierce said. “What also survives is a continuing desire to minimize the human costs.”
Galeti went on to discuss how national attitudes toward the military have shifted in the century and a half since the Civil War.
“Some things come into and out of fashion, like romantic notions of war glory, which were definitely stopped at the end of the Civil War. The glory of war or the ugly realities of war kind of wax and wane over time,” he said.
Despite these changes, Pierce acknowledged the universality of the veteran experience.
“Some things never change … such as fears of dying far away from home — dying a violent death,” he said.
The panel also compared the public response to returning veterans in the 19th century with the response to those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan today.
“The public reaction was uneven,” Manning said. “Civil War veterans were looked on in later years, with some suspicion, as leeches.”
All of the panelists emphasized the importance of expressing appreciation for modern veterans.
“We do not know enough about the nature of military experience, the nature of military culture,” Burns said. “The divide is an apparent division … but we need to do active work … to close it.”
Pierce agreed.
“To me it is enormous moral progress of this country that we’ve changed the mindset from the Vietnam War to … even if you hate the war, you respect and even revere the troops,” he said.

Student autism activist Lydia Brown (COL ’15) organized a panel that addressed disability culture in the classrooms and mainstream society in Intercultural Center Wednesday.
The panel, titled “Disability and Inclusion in the Humanities,” included Elizabeth J. Grace, an assistant professor in Diversity in Learning and Teaching at National Louis University, Director of Ableism Awareness and Community Outreach for the Disability Rights Coalition at American University Ki’tay Davidson, Disability Center planning committee member Renleigh Martin Spencer (COL ’15) and Kassiane A. Sibley, associate editor of “The Thinking Person’s Guide to Autism.”
Brown said that her personal experiences motivated her to create the event and encourage more discussion on enabling those who are disabled.
“I wanted to talk about how we can move away from just providing the bare minimum assistance required by law and really create a culture of inclusion for disabled people,” she said.
The panelists discussed the culture of ableism — prejudice against people with disabilities — at academic institutions and ways that schools ignore the needs of people who identify as disabled.
“When you are diagnosed, you are not a person who has agency,” Grace said. “Suddenly you are a person who has behaviors and not a person who has agency.”
Sibley described her own experiences as an autistic student.
“I have to explain to my professors every day that my … condition is the human condition. I am a person too,” Sibley said.
The panelists said that academic institutions are often reluctant to embrace disability awareness.
“We had a large number of [disabled students] at our schools, and they were asked to prove that they needed whatever it was that they needed,” Grace said of disabled students at National Louis University.
Davidson added that society must do more to embrace difference.
“A medical understanding of disability is not enough,” Davidson said. “It’s not enough to say, ‘What services do you need?’ We need to bring it into the cultural realm.”
Spencer added that she thinks the inclusion of disability studies in academia will promote disability culture in larger society.
“Any sort of identity studies should come first,” Spencer said. “We need to understand oppression. That is why disability studies [are] very important.”
The panelists also explained that well-intentioned allies and institutions make mistakes that contribute to the culture of exclusion.
“All of these micro-aggressions happen in places that are very progressive and claim to be very open to disability rights and are very considerate of other identities,” Sibley said.
“Sometimes we don’t want the type of help that you are trying to give.”
Davidson said that self-advocacy, student support and increased understanding can pave the way for a culture of inclusion.
“Self-advocacy is important, when it does not turn into victim-blaming,” Davidson said. “Let’s say, for example that I have a label like Autistic. The way that I would explain autism is [very] different [from] how others would explain it. So we need to stop making it medical, so that it isn’t if you have met one autistic person, you have met all autistic people.”

The Corp Philanthropy Committee has increased its annual scholarship awards by $10,500 this year, according to CPC Chair Ryan Muldoon (COL ’13).
In fiscal year 2012, the Students of Georgetown, Inc.-run committee awarded $20,250 in scholarship funds, a figure that increased to $30,750 in fiscal year 2013. Additionally The Corp has added four additional scholarships to the five existing opportunities, which will allow more students to benefit, according to Muldoon.
“Scholarships are ways to get each individual Corp service involved with the philanthropic work of The Corp as a whole,” Muldoon said. “[They] afford us an opportunity to connect our services to their unique customer base … and to engage the employees of those services in helping determine the final scholarship recipients.”
Each service organizes its own scholarship competition. Students submit pieces online, and CPC and store executives choose the winners.
CPC also offers grants to student organizations. Students can apply online throughout the year, and CPC grants money on a case-by-case basis based on how the organization’s use of the funds will benefit the Georgetown community.
Since July 2012, CPC has received 45 grant applications and approved 28 so far. All grants and scholarships are financed by a yearly budget of $60,000.
“With this budget in mind, we are seeking to have the greatest possible impact on groups applying for funding,” Muldoon said.
CPC assigns two of its members to represent and monitor grant-winning organizations.
“Being a representative for CPC is a great way to connect at a very individual level with student groups and organizations on campus,” CPC representative Daniella Mitchell (MSB ’15) said. “The whole point of CPC is to further The Corp’s mission of students serving students by helping to fund their events and projects that impact the entirety of the Georgetown community.”
Muldoon said he hopes that CPC’s efforts will allow students to consider their purchases as investments in the Georgetown community.
“I hope that increasing numbers of Corp customers enter our services with the understanding that The Corp is more than coffee and grocery products,” he said. “The Corp is dedicated to enhancing our campus in a spirit of students serving students.”

This weekend, students, alumni, faculty and staff will participate in Georgetown’s first Hackathon, an idea development and implementation session.
“Hacking is about identifying [a] problem, breaking [the] problem down to its most essential core and figuring out the solution to it,” event co-organizer Keaton Bedell (COL ’13) said.
Registration for the event closed on Nov. 7 and is open to 130 people, who will be divided into 20 teams. Each team will design an app, service or product that focuses on transforming one of five aspects of community life: living, learning, working, playing or serving.
According to Bedell, the event will allow student ideas to be put into action.
“There’s already a culture at Georgetown of wanting to solve problems and take action,” he said. “TheHackathon will provide an opportunity to really incubate that forward at an accelerated rate because sometimes students feel frustrated with the speed of things that happen at the university.”
According to Program Manager for New Media and Special Projects Michael Wang (MSB ’07), the Hackathon is an expansion of the Innovation Summit that took place last April.
“The Georgetown Innovation Summit was about an exchange of ideas and inspiration,” he said. “This Georgetown Hackathon is about turning those ideas into action.”
Wang was inspired to organize the event after attending a “Reinvent Business” Hackathon in San Francisco, CA in June. That event was sponsored by the World Economic Forum’s Global Agenda Council on Values in Decision-Making, a council that monitors and addresses global challenges.
“It was inspiring to see what groups of engaged teams — made up of designers, programmers, storytellers, business folks and academics — were able to come up with ideas and prototypes. If anything, the ideas were even stronger due to the interdisciplinary skill sets of each team,” Wang said. “That was our ‘aha’ moment. … This is a concept that could work at Georgetown.”
University Information Service Communications Manager Una Hildebrandt agreed with Wang and stressed the importance of widespread student involvement in this weekend’s event.
“The Hackathon will align with the goal of reflecting the diversity of the university community,” Hildebrandtsaid. “So it’s not just computer science students gathering together. It’s larger and broader.”
External mentors from institutions that include Teach for America, software company Palantir Technologies, innovation and design firm IDEO and online travel planning site Travelzoo will hold workshops to discuss specific skills and development.
“We hope that teams will sharpen their products and ideas by constantly getting input and feedback directly from the people who would implement these products,” Wang said.
The top four teams will win cash prizes totaling $2,000 and a chance to sit down with university administrators and companies for an idea-implementation session. Three of the winners will be chosen by a committee comprising Provost Robert Groves, Chief Information Officer Lisa Davis, Chief Operating Officer Chris Augostini, Senior Adviser to the President Victor Reinoso, Program Officer of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Emily Dalton Smith, Georgetown global marketing professor Rohit Bhargava and Chief Executive Officer of Irving Information Group Larry Irving after the event Sunday. The final winner will be picked by the Georgetown community through the IdeaScale website.
“I think it’s a great avenue for the community to say, ‘I see a problem, I have a way to help solve this. Or I see something I think can be better, and I’m part of the solution.’ It’s a great mentality to promote,” Hildebrandt said.

The Georgetown University Student Association Senate began discussions about altering the electoral system for senate elections at its weekly meeting Sunday evening.
Currently, senators are elected via an instant runoff system through which voters rank candidates by preference, and the candidate with the fewest votes at the end of each round is eliminated.
“We just wanted to see if instant runoff voting is still the best way to do it,” Vice Speaker of the GUSA Senate Zachary Singer (SFS ’15) said.
Singer proposed the reform because the amount of people who ran for senate positions this fall made the election process time-consuming and complicated for the two chairs of the GUSA Election Commission, Ethan Chess (COL ’14) and Pavan Raigopal (SFS ’15), who were responsible for calculating votes and determining district winners in the election.
“Right now it is two people running through an enormous amount of data,” Singer said.
Senator at-large and chairman of the Intellectual Life Committee George Spyropoulos Dorian (COL ’14) agreed.
“The elections were the most competitive so far … and it’s OK to assume that it will be more competitive in the future,” he said. “It took longer and was more tedious. Candidates didn’t know until the morning of the first session of the senate.”
However, Chess said that the work load is not his primary concern.
“The real issue is for voters,” he said. “The election commission can pull an all-nighter, but the real issue is for the voters and when they’re voting what is the easiest thing for them to express their rights and to vote for best candidate — the candidate that they want
He added that the increased volume of candidates was a result of the Senate Redistricting Bill last November, which resulted in more equally represented districts. According to Chess, before the bill was passed, student living off- campus were less represented than students on campus.
“We decided that the best way to do it was to have senators from multiple dorms be combined so … votes would count almost equally,” he said.
“The result of that was big districts with people who really want to run,” Singer said. “It works great for the executive elections, and it works great for smaller districts, but it may have gotten a little too bloated with the amount of people.”
An election reform commission, which will include seven students — Chess, Raigopal, three GUSA senators, Singer and one appointed member of the executive — will meet for the first time Sunday to begin gathering research about different election processes to craft a bill, according to Dorian.
Singer said he aims to have research completed by Dec. 7 so the senate can debate and vote on the bill before winter break.
“We want to make sure that how we elect our senators is not only the most efficient process but also produces a result that everyone can be happy with because the last thing we want to do is skew results because of a complicated system,” he said.

More than 300 people attended the third Georgetown Entrepreneurship Day on Nov. 9.
The event, which was sponsored by the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative, the Hoya Challenge and the MBA Entrepreneurship Club, provided students with the opportunity to reach out to business owners in the D.C. community.
According to Director of Entrepreneurship and Real Estate Initiatives Jeff Reid, the event had three goals: to expose students to entrepreneurship, provide students with an opportunity to pitch their ideas to experts and receive feedback and incorporate the entrepreneurial community into campus life.
The two-day event included a career panel series, keynote speakers, small-group breakout sessions and a closing reception.
Sarah Henderson (MSB ’14), leader of the Hoya Challenge, organized a rocket pitch competition, that allowed 18 teams to pitch two minute business ideas in front of a panel of 25 judges.
“It was super exciting and fun to watch,” Henderson said.
Tara de Nicolas (GRD ’13) won the rocket pitch.
“As an entrepreneur, you feel so alone in your own little world with own ideas but to be around people who are really achieving their dreams really opened the door for me to a community of individuals that I can learn from. It was truly inspiring,” she said.
Reid said he was pleased with turnout at the event.
“It was a widely diverse crowd. They gave great feedback about the speakers and really enjoyed hearing the student’s ideas,” Reid said. “I hope it becomes an annual event and the highlight of the fall semester for the entrepreneurial community at Georgetown.”
However, Henderson said she hopes more people attend next year.
“In the future I hope that there is a higher turnout of undergraduates,” Henderson said. “I think that many undergraduates, especially in the business school, don’t think much about entrepreneurship, but it’s a cool day to network and meet people in the field.”

Georgetown University Dining Services held a canned food drive in O’Donovan Hall this week in honor of Thanksgiving.
Donations will be given to Bread for the City, a nonprofit organization that provides food, clothing and other social services to impoverished people in Washington, D.C.
Students, the Georgetown Dining team and other members of the campus community were encouraged to donate nonperishable goods by placing them on a table that was set up in the lobby of Leo’s during the week of Nov. 12.
“We chose Bread for the City for this food drive due to their commitment [to] providing healthy food to vulnerable residents of the D.C. area, and [we] are interested in learning about other area organizations to partner with in the future,” Dining Services Market Manager Kendra Boyer wrote in an email.
However, Bread for the City usually requests monetary donations to purchase turkeys instead of non-perishable goods at this time of year.
“We encourage people to run fundraising drives instead so we can purchase turkeys, which … we need most this time of year,” Development Associate of Communications for Bread for the City Jessica Nazar said. “We will accept food donations, but the reason we encourage people to fundraise is because we promote healthy eating, and a lot of times, people donate unhealthy non-perishable goods for us to use.”
To alleviate this problem, Dining Services is only requesting healthy foods — low-sodium, low-sugar and whole-wheat products.
Boyer said that the goal is to collect several boxes of food by Nov. 18.
“We are anticipating the drive to be [a] success with student involvement and hope that it will become an annual drive,” she wrote.
