Joe Luther (COL ’16) and Connor Rohan (COL ’16) are leading the 2015 Georgetown University Student Association executive race with 23 percent of likely voters choosing their ticket, according to a door-to-door poll conducted by The Hoya on Monday night.
Sara Margolis (COL ’16) and Ryan Shymansky (COL ’16) were a close second, trailing by six votes with 21.5 percent of likely voters. Abbey McNaughton (COL ’16) and Will Simons (COL ’16) tied for third place with Chris Wadibia (COL ’16) and Meredith Cheney (COL ’16), with 15.6 percent of likely voters each. Tim Rosenberger (COL ’16) and Reno Varghese (SFS ’16) came last, with 4.6 percent of the vote. 19.7 percent of likely voters remain undecided.
The poll sampled 616 students, with only 391 identifying as likely voters. Of likely voters, 158 were freshmen, 86 were sophomores, 112 were juniors and 28 were seniors.
“Well, we are happy that people share our vision for a Youtopia on campus,” Luther said.
“I think that this is a great intro to the Stewards,” Rohan said. “I am expecting an email from them. Or a phone call.”
Students polled showed a general apathy toward GUSA, with 7.1 percent citing it as very relevant, 46.6 percent citing it as somewhat relevant, 31.4 percent citing it as not very relevant and 14.9 percent cited it as not relevant at all. The numbers were similar to the 2014 poll in which 9.5 percent called GUSA very relevant to student life, 53.6 percent called it somewhat relevant, 26.7 percent called it not very relevant and 8.2 percent called it not at all relevant.
Students demonstrated a similar apathy toward the current administration of Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) and Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15).
While 27.4 percent of respondents approved of the Tezel and Jikaria administration, compared to a disapproval rating of 2.9 percent, 69.7 percent were unsure. In 2013 the GUSA president and vice president — Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) and Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14), respectively — received a 35.4 percent approval rating and 4.4 percent disapproval rating, with 60 percent uncertain.
“I don’t know if I would describe it as much as apathy, but what is inherently a difficult progress to measure, which is the quality to which we as an organization are advocating on behalf of students,” Tezel said. “I think that if you took a poll of students and said how do you feel about how student affairs has been operating in the last year, I think you would see that the unsure number would go down from there. The energy we’re seeing around this most recent election shows that students have a lot of opinions about how things should be run and that this is the one outlet to it.”
Polling results also varied based on how closely students polled were following the election. Only 61 percent of likely voters were closely following the election.
Of the 150 likely voters not following the election closely, Luther and Rohan again came first with 36 percent, Wadibia and Cheney came second with 15.3 percent, Margolis and Shymansky came in third with 14.7 percent, McNaughton and Simons ranked fourth with 12.67 percent and Rosenberger and Varghese finished last with 3.3 percent, while 18 percent of these voters remained undecided.
Among the 234 likely voters who identified as following the election, Luther and Rohan dropped to fourth with 13.7 percent of the vote, while Margolis and Shymansky came in first with 26.5 percent of the vote, McNaughton and Simons ranked second with 17.5 percent of the vote, Wadibia and Cheney came in third with 15.4 percent and Rosenberger and Varghese stayed in last with 5.6 percent. 21.4 percent of these voters were still undecided.
“I think this is another example of people just being turned off by GUSA and the usual campaign season,”  Luther said of the discrepancy. “Ignorance is bliss, and we hope to talk to the informed voters on why our platform is the strongest.”
Margolis said she believes her team can push ahead by two points to win the election.
“I think it’s encouraging that we’re so close to first place,” Margolis said. “We have a really, really awesome team that has put in an incredible amount of work, and I’m happy that it seems like a lot of Hoyas are really responding to all our ideas. It’s certainly not too late. Two percent doesn’t seem like too much. We have another 36 hours, and I’m optimistic.”
Simons said that although his ticket is in third place, he believes that the team still has ample campaigning time. He and McNaughton will continue to reach out to students in the next 48 hours before the election concludes.
“Obviously, there’s a lot of time left and there’s still plenty of people who are undecided,” Simons said. “We’ve been really inspired by our support up to this point, and think that we are in a fantastic position to win this election. We know that the poll is only a sample of the Georgetown student population and not fully representative, although it has been an indicator in the past years. What I want to stress is that the next 48 hours are going to be crucial for the outcome of this election.”
Wadibia, whose ticket is also tied for third, agreed and said that he and Cheney will continue their efforts by speaking to students and sharing their platform.
“Chris and Meredith remain passionate about the opportunity to serve the student body and win this election,” Wadibia said. “Our hopes could not be higher. Our staff could not be better, and we look forward to getting to know the people over the next couple days before the election.”
Rosenberger, who currently sits in last place, said he remains hopeful, especially after Monday’s presidential debate.
“I think a lot more than 20 percent are undecided at this point,” Rosenberger said. “We just had a big debate; I think we’re going to see a lot of shifting. These polls have a way of suggesting the direction of things up to a point, but I’m not super concerned.”

(Berlin Cheng/The Hoya, Shannon Hou/The Hoya and Alexander Brown/The Hoya)
Methodology: 
The Hoya conducted a campus-wide, door-to-door poll of Georgetown students on Sunday night in advance of the Georgetown University Student Association executive election Feb. 18 to 19.
Although the polling method is not scientific, it was designed to reduce sample bias and provide transparency on demographics.
More than 20 Hoya staff members administered the anonymous survey Monday evening in all 15 campus dormitories and apartment buildings and on five streets in Burleith and west Georgetown selected for their high proportion of student residences. Polling began at 6:30 p.m. and was completed by 8 p.m. The schedule and locations for polling were not announced beforehand.
A total of 616 Georgetown students completed surveys, which asked students about their views on the relevance of GUSA and the performance of the current GUSA executives, their views of the current election — including their vote choice — and a series of demographic questions. Respondents were also asked whether they planned to vote in Thursday’s election, allowing the results of some poll questions to be narrowed to a set of likely voters, which number 391 in the aggregate.
These measures limited readership bias and prevented respondents from being polled twice and was designed to be representative of the student body. However, as was the case last year, respondents to the poll were mostly underclassmen, likely because of the relative inaccessibility of junior and senior housing.

“We really do believe in every single student here,” Shymansky said of his campaign. “I think that the issue is that sometimes when people talk about what is the ‘exec’ going to do on its own, I think part of the ‘exec’ functioning well is believing in students to go out and change things.”
 
“The Chris and Meredith 2015 campaign is not just a campaign, it’s a movement,” Wadibia said. “It’s not just about winning, it’s about how we win. If we win [in the way] every GUSA campaign that has traditionally won has, we’ve done nothing.”
 
“I was asked to work on most of the other major campaigns, and each time I was asked, starting in August, there was no campaign that was really bringing forth the issues I’m passionate about,” Rosenberger said. “There was nobody that I thought I could joyfully throw myself into supporting.”
 
 
“[We want] a cultural change within GUSA, making sure that every student is involved and engaged,” Simons said. “If we can create this new culture – an inclusive, representative, engaging culture – then every GUSA administration after us will be more successful. That is a huge priority.”
 
“I think there’s a very large difference between taking yourself seriously and taking your job seriously,” Luther added. “I think that, for years, people were really alienated by how seriously the GUSA crowd takes themselves, and I think that’s really hindered their ability to do their jobs, so we think, by taking a different approach by how we’re treating ourselves, it has no implication about how we’d treat the job.”

Keith Ellison, the Democratic representative of Minnesota’s Fifth District, chief deputy whip to the house democratic whip, co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the first Muslim in Congress spoke on Feb. 11 about the problems facing America today and what Georgetown students can do to make a positive difference in the political community. The event, co-sponsored by Georgetown University College Democrats, Georgetown University Muslim Student Association, Georgetown University Muslim Life and the Center for Social Justice, was held in the Reiss Science Building.
Matt Gregory (COL ’17), the chairman of Georgetown University College Democrats, introduced Ellison, who focused his speech on the importance of idealism in today’s youth, the steps that must be taken to fix the issues that American political system currently faces and the hurdles he encountered as the first Muslim in Congress.
Ellison began by stressing how important open dialogue with the students would be throughout the event.
“There’s a lot of important things going on in the world right now, and I think that we should talk about them,” Ellison said. “I want you to know that there are no off limit questions … it doesn’t matter to me whether you’re very liberal or very conservative or anything like that. There’s nothing we can’t discuss.”
Ellison emphasized the paramount importance of being optimistic, and said that cynicism does not lead to success.
“Whenever I run into a young person who is cynical and who thinks that you’re a chump or a sucker, if you believe that things can be better it makes me a little sad,” Ellison said. “Whenever young people that I encounter think that it is somehow sophisticated to assume the worst and that nothing’s going to go right it makes me a little sad, because if the youth aren’t idealistic and the youth don’t feel like the world can be a better place heaven help the rest of us.”
Ellison spoke of the great strides that the United States has been able to accomplish as a nation and of how a cynical representation of America’s current state would not be fair or beneficial to the country.
“The fact is, that if you want to tell a tale that America is irredeemably, irretrievably racist; if you want to tell a tale that America is irretrievably religiously bigoted; if you want to say that the class divisions are so wide and the rich will always stomp on the poor there is evidence on the record to stand on, but, what about the other side of the coin too?” Ellison asked. “What about the fact that we used to have segregation in our country and we don’t? What about the fact that to my mother it was inconceivable to her that there could be a black president and there is? … This is progress!”
Ellison stressed the income gap as one of the most pressing issues that our country faces today, and said that the rising cost of education is especially impacted by the income disparity.
“The fact that education is so expensive in the United States, even in public universities, you know it doesn’t have to be that way,” Ellison said. “This is a political decision we have made.”
Ellison claimed that economic growth is halted by the income gap as well.
“One of the reasons that we have had very, in my opinion, anemic economic growth is there are not enough rich people to spend money to fuel this demand driven economy,” Ellison said.
Ellison insisted that economic issues can be fixed by the younger generations.
“This is a problem you and your generation have got to help us solve,” Ellison said.
The representative also discussed campaigning and how to prevent political corruption by encouraging more transparency within campaigns.
In addition, Ellison discussed his position as the first Muslim in Congress, and how he faced intense hate and resentment from some citizens.
“One guy named Dennis Prager … says Keith Ellison is more dangerous to the republic than Osama Bin Laden,” Ellison said.
Ellison said, however that he believes that interfaith dialogue is an extremely important step in making a positive change in the world.
“I’ve always thought to myself we should break bread together, we should share meals together, we should feed the poor together, we should visit the elderly together, we should make the world a better place together,” Ellison said.
Ellison closed by prompting the audience to act.
“Don’t forget we’ve got a world here to fix … go heal the world,” Ellison said.
Enushe Khan (MSB’17), who attended the event, said she appreciated Ellison’s foreign policy points.
“I think that was a very inspiring talk for me personally,” Khan said. “I was very happy to hear his thoughts on foreign policy. … He was a very engaging speaker, and it was a great event and a very great talk.”
Leah von der Heyde (COL ‘15) said she enjoyed Ellison’s talk because of the way he addressed his faith.
“College Democrats advertised it as him being the first Muslim representative, which I think is really important, but then he did not make a big deal out of it until the very end,” Von Der Heyde said. “He actually stressed the interfaith dialogue and that it didn’t matter where he personally came from, but he emphasized a broader picture and I thought that was pretty amazing.”

Chris Wadibia (COL ’16) and Meredith Cheney’s (COL ’16) paths to Georgetown diverged from that of the university’s archetype. For starters, the prospect of attending Georgetown was initially distant to both candidates.
Originally from Mobile, Ala., Wadibia said that he attributes much of his dedication to serving the students of Georgetown to his gratitude toward the university.
“I know what it’s like not to be at Georgetown. I come from southern Alabama, and I was told I wasn’t smart enough to be here,” Wadibia said. “I didn’t have the money be here either, but I’m here today. And Georgetown has been so good to me, and I’ve always sought out ways I could give back to Georgetown and pay it forward. For me, this is my way of seeking to serve my fellow students.”
Likewise, Cheney, who transferred twice, first from Southern Methodist University to Villanova University, then to Georgetown, said that once she arrived here, she realized that she wanted to become a large part of the university, namely through the Georgetown University Student Association.
“I had transferred twice and never really felt that I could find the true college experience and now that I have, and I’m being so happy at Georgetown,” Cheney said. “I didn’t think it was within my ability as a transfer to really have that much of a change. But as time progressed, and I was involved in more things … it became clear that [running for vice president] could be an option.”
The two candidates have also been involved in campus life on many different levels. With no prior affiliations to GUSA, Wadibia has actively served in leadership positions in ESCAPE, the African Society of Georgetown, Lecture Fund and Leaders in Education About Diversity, in addition to a term as a community member on The Hoya’s editorial board. Wadibia is perhaps known best among students for his talk on interfaith understanding entitled “Being Fully Human” that he delivered at TEDxGeorgetown last November.
By contrast, Cheney has devoted much of her time at Georgetown to serving as a GUSA senator, originally representing the Southwest Quad and now Nevils and Alumni Square, in addition to her position as vice chair of the GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee. Outside of GUSA, Cheney is chair of Georgetown Day and a communications coordinator of the Office of Sustainability.
The two met through their work on the Lecture Fund, and developed a friendship and working relationship, which culminate in this campaign.
Despite different backgrounds, Wadibia and Cheney are united in their emphasis on dignity, which has become a buzzword for their campaign on campus since it was unleashed as the pair’s slogan.
After launching their “dignity” campaign, The Wadibia-Cheney ticket has faced recent challenges. Wadibia said his poster in Red Square has been torn down multiple times, his Facebook posts have been flagged as pornography and he has been accused of homophobia and ignorance about sexual assault.
“I have been accused of being homophobic. … I have been accused of being pro-sexual assault, yet every individual on this campus knows that when I speak to persons—particularly women—I speak to every individual with respect,” Wadibia said in the presidential debate Monday.
Despite these setbacks, the pair remains firm in their plans to make students “admire” GUSA, which they believe will restore the association’s “dignity.”
“[Many students] find [GUSA] to be an elitist, distant, aloof institution,” Wadibia said. “[We] wish to restore dignity to the student association, so that students look upon GUSA as something that they admire [and] cherish, because it makes practical, tangible differences in their lives.”
According to Cheney, an important part of dignity is recognizing the voices of all students. Though all campaigns in the race value student involvement and made it a large part of their platforms, Cheney claims that her ticket’s “trickle-down” approach is unique.
“The most important thing with dignity is that leadership is mostly top-down, so you gotta start this movement somewhere,” Cheney said. “This is what Chris and I hope to do, and that trickles down through the rest of the community to recognize that their voices are as equals are ours, and that their knowledge base on specific issues needs to be heard, and we’re just there to reiterate that basically.”
When asked to describe one another, both candidates mentioned the qualities of passion and approachability.
“I think that one of Chris’s most endearing qualities is how deeply loyal he is to whatever he chooses to put his heart into,” Cheney said. “It takes one moment to speak to Chris, then you’re completely captivated by his character and willingness to just listen and to speak with you.”
Wadibia described Cheney as more light-hearted than he is, in addition to being affable.
“Meredith is kind of like the heart and soul of the campaign … You know when I get too serious, she’s the one to kind of go, push me around a little bit and say ‘Loosen up,’” Wadibia said. “When Meredith connects with an individual, she doesn’t just say ‘Hi, it’s good to meet you, let’s get lunch sometime,’ then doesn’t follow up with it. [S]he’ll follow up with you. Meredith is about deep relationships with individuals … and that’s what we want to do with the student association.”
Other members on the Wadibia and Cheney team agreed that the two candidates are interested in the well being of other students.
Underclassmen Campaign Manager Tim Yim (SFS ’17) said that Wadibia’s ability to connect personally with students was evident from his role as a residential assistant.
“Chris was my residential assistant and he was such a genuine person here at Georgetown that it surprised me. He stood out at being warm and welcoming on a campus that was so politically charged,” Yim said. “True, Chris isn’t the political mastermind, but that is his great strength. [He has an] ability [to] transcend politics and return GUSA from its overcharged duties back into an association for students.
Similarly, Chief of Communications and Social Media Natalia Peña (COL ’17) described Cheney to be a good friend above all.
“Meredith has been nothing short of spectacular. Her involvement on campus may be a lot, but she finds time to run and meet up for brunch. Her passion for student issues and well-being is hard to surpass,” Peña said.
Beyond their experience with various student groups and the goals on their platform, Wadibia and Cheney hope to bring this passion for building relationships with students to GUSA if elected.
“When was the last time the student body president or vice president walked by you, shook your hand, looked you in the eye and said ‘How are you doing today, my friend?,’” Wadibia asked. “That’s a foreign concept at Georgetown when it comes to the GUSA executives, but that’s the personability [sic], loyalty and diligence that we want to bring to GUSA.”
Despite Wadibia’s claim, current GUSA executives Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) and Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15) made student and GUSA communication and collaboration a large facet of their campaign, with an entire section called “Connect to Your Community.”
“We want to connect students to both GUSA and the administration, through things like the multicultural council and holding office hours for GUSA,” Tezel said in an interview about his platform in February 2014.
Although other candidates have said they value student participation and collaboration, Wadibia said that he wants to make substantive changes to the way that GUSA operates by championing student relationships, which he believes sets his ticket apart from the rest.
“The Chris and Meredith 2015 campaign is not just a campaign, it’s a movement,” Wadibia said. “It’s not just about winning, it’s about how we win. If we win [in the way] every GUSA campaign that has traditionally won has, we’ve done nothing.”

In the summer before his sophomore year, Tim Rosenberger’s (COL ’16) parents discovered that he was gay.
“Their position was, ‘We aren’t paying for Georgetown,’” Rosenberger said. “‘Georgetown is why you think this lifestyle is OK. Sending you to this school and paying for it would be like giving a heroin addict money for drugs.’ That was the exact analogy. So I had no money.”
Rosenberger moved out of his family home to live with a friend in Cleveland, Ohio and weighed his options. He decided to contact the Georgetown Scholarship Program to see if it was possible to return to school, and was met with a positive response.
“It was like this mysterious process, but everything came around well enough,” Rosenberger said. “I became a [resident assistant], I received much more financial aid. In terms of having money to live with and play with, I got three jobs. Last summer I was working 90 hours a week. It was crazy. But, it all worked out.”
After Rosenberger returned to campus, he involved himself in the gay community by becoming active in GU Pride, which he said taught him about many smaller student groups on campus.
“By becoming a part of that group, through doing programs about intersectionality, I got exposed to a lot of other groups on campus with equally large concerns,” Rosenberger said. “Through GSP, I met a lot of people with a lot of really concerning experiences and I realized that, I thought about my time in GUSA in the senate, we never talked about these students.”
As candidates for the 2015 Georgetown University Student Association executive race began creating platforms, Rosenberger studied them thoroughly, hoping that a ticket would advocate for the groups that he worked with in GU Pride.
“I was asked to work on most of the other major campaigns, and each time I was asked, starting in August, there was no campaign that was really bringing forth the issues I’m passionate about,” Rosenberger said. “There was nobody that I thought I could joyfully throw myself into supporting.
After failing to see a ticket promoting the issues he saw as most important — these particular students and their concerns — Rosenberger decided to enter the presidential race himself.
“We [the senate] were never having conversations about these students in crisis,” Rosenberger said. “I think making their voices heard would go a great way toward making the university more responsive, making students more supportive, making classes better attuned to students.”
When he decided to run, Rosenberger, who has written in The Hoya about his experience working at Town Danceboutique, a gay bar in the District, attracted attention in a Catholic, conservative online magazine called Pewsitter in late January. The article, titled “Militant Gay Republican Set To Become Georgetown Student Body President,” features a letter written from an anonymous, Georgetown-related source calling Rosenberger a “militant homosexual activist” and endorsing candidate Abbey McNaughton (COL ’16) for her Catholic ties.
Despite the article and a barrage of insulting emails sent to his personal account after its publication, Rosenberger continued to build his campaign staff and develop his platform.
Looking for a running mate with experience in the GUSA Senate, Rosenberger chose first-term At-Large Senator Reno Varghese (SFS ’16).
Rosenberger said that Varghese’s experience with a large number of student groups and his understanding of the campus plan — Varghese serves on the senate subcommittee concerning the 2018 Campus Plan — made him an appealing choice.
“I don’t think there’s anybody on campus that gets funding reform, the campus plan and the logistics of running GUSA as well as Reno,” Rosenberger said.
Both Rosenberger and Varghese have involved themselves in a wide range of groups and activities both on- and off-campus over the past three years.
On their campaign website, Rosenberger says his favorite organizations are the Georgetown Scholarship Program and Campus Ministry. Varghese says his favorite part of Georgetown has been his involvement with the International Relations Club, serving on their board last year and travelling with the Model United Nations team.
Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15), who ran in last year’s GUSA executive election, said that Rosenberger has been a close friend and confidante since they met through GU Pride.
“Tim and I have described each other as each other’s arms, as each other’s right hand, for a long time,” Lloyd said. “He’s one of the most caring and giving people I’ve ever known. It’s funny; Tim comes across to people as very cool and very calm and quiet. Being a Republican, people will instantly apply negative stereotypes to him. But there’s really no one I know who would do more for someone they care about without question.”
Zach Busch (SFS ’16) met Varghese during his freshman year at a Model UN conference and has lived with him the past two years.
“Reno is a man of many talents and eccentricities,” Busch said. “He never sleeps. He’s always finding something new to be passionate about and he does always follow through somehow, even with all of his commitments. He is there for his friends. He’s deeply loyal.”
Together, Rosenberger and Varghese have worked to craft a platform “for the love of Georgetown,” as their campaign slogan reads. The pair plans to, first of all, fix certain Georgetown issues immediately.
“I think that what we’re focusing on is that we want all of the things on our platform to be things that can actually happen,” Varghese said. “Things like funding reform, things like inclusion access, even things like expanding What’s a Hoya? We think we can work with the fundamentals and make them better.”
In addition to the “fundamentals,” Rosenberger said that his ticket will work to advocate for students and campus workers.
“We know that Leo’s is abusing their workers. We know that people become ill because of food on campus,” Rosenberger said. “We know that people who have mobility issues get put on the fourth floor of Copley, the elevators break. There are these things that are really problematic and we need to fix quickly, and these are things we’ll focus on first.”
One particularly important area of focus for Rosenberger is reforming mental health and Counseling and Psychiatric Services on campus.
Last year, his close friend Lloyd called CAPS after Daniel Milzman, a then-College sophomore in the Class of 2016 admitted to him that he had manufactured ricin, which he brought to Lloyd’s room. CAPS failed to respond to Lloyd’s call for over an hour, and during that time, Lloyd called Rosenberger for advice.
“In terms of CAPS, no candidate has had a horror story like me,” Rosenberger said. “Nobody else has been called by a friend who has a biotoxin in their room.”
In their platform, Rosenberger and Varghese propose expanding the size of the CAPS office, hiring additional staff for longer-term therapy and prescribing privileges for anti-depressants. CAPS Director Phil Meilman said that, following this incident, the program is working with students like Rosenberger to improve their services.
“We are presently working with a dedicated group of students on strengthening our outreach, more clearly defining on our website the services we offer, and considering new issues and ventures that the students have suggested,” Meilman wrote in an email.
Rosenberger and Varghese are looking to expand a number of programs such as the GU Farmers’ Market, which they say should have expanded seasonal availability given its popularity on campus. Rosenberger and Varghese said they want to bolster Georgetown’s Collegiate Readership Program, as well.
“[We want to] see if we can add to the Colleg[iate] Readership program, by adding the Wall Street Journal, the Economist and Barron’s, as well as perhaps shift some of the paper distribution online for sustainability purposes as well as to save money,” Rosenberger said.
In fact, the print readership program, which provided copies of USA Today, the Washington Post and the New York Times, was cut by the current GUSA executive team in March to preserve its budget. Currently, GUSA provides students with online subscriptions to the New York Times, a service that began in September.
Rosenberger also said he wants to build on the freshman-oriented What’s a Hoya? program with an increased budget, more executive support and the inclusion of sophomores and transfer students.
What’s a Hoya? coordinator Megan Murday (SFS ’15) said that these changes would benefit the program and enable it to better serve the student body.
“It’s a good time for the future of the program when the GUSA executive tickets are talking about it,” Murday said. “A solid relationship with the GUSA executive is paramount to the success of the program and I’m happy to see them paying attention to it.”
Rosenberger and Varghese have also proposed appointing an unrecognized student group adviser to the Council Advisory Board, a move that would allow groups like H*yas for Choice and sororities and fraternities to have more representation.
Rosenberger said that he believes he and Varghese can fix the most pressing problems facing Georgetown.
“The university, for all of its faults, does a decent job of trying to address issues. They just don’t do it very well,” Rosenberger said. “Reno and I have shown in the past, through our work on campus, that we really get these issues and can work to change them.”

Of all the executive candidates contesting this week’s Georgetown University Student Association election, Abbey McNaughton (COL ’16) has the most tangible experience with the organization, currently serving as the vice-speaker of the GUSA senate, in her fourth semester as a senator.
On the other hand, her running mate Will Simons (COL ’16) has none, instead cultivating grassroots student organizations throughout his time on the Hilltop.
In accordance with their opposing administrative and outsider experiences, the ticket has focused on the student experience, promoting student activities and advocating for student rights.
“[We want] a cultural change within GUSA, making sure that every student is involved and engaged,” Simons said. “If we can create this new culture – an inclusive, representative, engaging culture – then every GUSA administration after us will be more successful. That is a huge priority.”
Both members of the ticket explained that their families instilled their beliefs in the role of service in student government.
“[There was] kind of a feeling I had grown up with my parents, with the focus on service and caring about the bigger picture,” McNaughton said. “So Georgetown was a perfect fit for me.”
Simons echoed McNaughton, noting his father’s influence.
“My dad in the past couple of years has gotten really into civic duty. I have a really high value of public service,” Simons said.
Simons also quoted “The West Wing,” in which the fictional president of the United States implores his staff to leave the country better than they found it.
For the candidates, leaving the campus better than they found it will involve a strong focus on empowering students to protect their rights. McNaughton found her inspiration to run for GUSA executive after speaking with one of her friends during the spring of her sophomore year about how difficult it is to get around Georgetown in a wheelchair.
“I was shocked at how little this topic was discussed on campus and how it didn’t seem like a bigger issue,” McNaughton said. “I thought, you know, I think this is the kind of thing that GUSA should be representing, student voices from all different parts of campus that are traditionally marginalized.”
In addition to handicap accessibility, the team’s 25-page platform also highlights socioeconomic changes to increase opportunities available to students on financial aid and mental health advocacy.
The pair will promote these initiatives and many others with the help of other student leaders. This student involvement and their student engagement platform will allow the team to rebuild GUSA’s relationship with Georgetown’s student body and include voices that have so often been ignored in the larger university discussions.
Queen Adesuyi (COL ’16), co-founder and co-president of the Black Pre-Law Association, commended the ticket’s motivation to be a voice for minorities on campus. As part of the socioeconomic change platform, Adesuyi highlighted proposed programs to help low-income students with laundry costs, as well as transportation, clothing and other costs associated with unpaid internships in D.C.
“Pre-professionalism is experienced differently when you do not have enough money to dress and play the part,” Adesuyi said. “I interned for my congressman during my sophomore year and as much as I enjoyed and appreciated my experience, it was a financial burden. I support Abbey and Will’s advocacy of socioeconomically under-represented students.”
Effectively advocating for all students’ rights will require a change in GUSA’s method of operation, which Simons criticized as unable to engage most of the student population. According to the McNaughton-Simons campaign, the starkly different backgrounds of the two names at the top of the ticket could help change that environment.
“Will has been a part of different student organizations than I’ve been a part of. We have a very strong combination of GUSA experience and non-GUSA experience, but [with] student advocacy,” McNaughton said.
McNaughton has served on the finance and appropriations committee as a sophomore and is currently acting as a student representative on the university board of directors in addition to her role as senate vice-speaker. She also was the vice president of Georgetown University College Republicans and a member of the College Academic Council.
“We come from a strong background in working with the administration because of my position with the board of directors,” McNaughton said. “It has allowed me to be involved in discussions about a lot of issues across campus on things like handicap accessibility, sexual assault and Kehoe field. That’s a wide array of different issues and I think that has provided us with many relationships with the university.”
As much experience as McNaughton has working with the administration, Simons has an impressive background in organizing and founding new student groups. Simons co-founded the Georgetown Speechwriting Advisory Group, a communications-consulting group run by students. He also helped found and lead the GU Club Golf team as well as the U.S.-Middle East Youth Network.
The grassroots experience came to the forefront last year, when Simons started the “Students Against Restrictive Housing Policy” social media campaign last January to fight the university’s changing housing policies. Within a week, the campaign convinced the university to postpone the policy change until the following year.
Simons said that engaging in grassroots campaigning could allow GUSA to become more effective at reaching the student populace.
“GUSA is in a unique role to lead student advocacy, mobilize students, get them involved and keep them involved and lead these efforts because its something that affects every student. The university actually listens to us when we have all students behind an idea,” Simons said.
The combination of GUSA experience with input from student organizations at large has attracted support around campus, including Georgetown University College Democrats President Matt Gregory (SFS ’17), who highlighted the combination of backgrounds as crucial to the candidacy.
“I believe that their ticket’s unique combination of prior GUSA experience and input from leaders representing dozens of diverse organizations … would allow them to serve the student body better than any other team in the race,” Gregory said.
Jessica Hickle (SFS ’18) commended the team’s plan to engage more students in the future, noting the candidates’ concern for the school and its students.
“When I first met Abbey we talked about stress and adjusting to college and I could tell she genuinely cared about what I was saying even though we didn’t know each other,” Hickle said. “I really respect her and Will for how much they care about everyone individually.”
As the campaign reaches its last week, McNaughton implored students to pay attention to the election, underlining the impact the executive would have over the next year on student issues.
“I want students to know that their vote matters,” McNaughton said. “The issues coming up in the next year do affect every single individual. Whoever they are voting for, it is important to recognize that you need to pick the people who you trust to represent your interests at the table in these discussions.”

February 17, 2015 by Andrew Wallender 1 Comment 
Two days before going home for Thanksgiving break, Ryan Shymansky (COL ’16) got a text.
Sara Margolis (COL ’16), the Georgetown University Student Association Secretary of Transfer Affairs, wanted meet concerning something related to GUSA. Shymansky thought he would grab coffee with Margolis at Saxby’s, probably talk about a potential workshop hosted by the Student Advocacy Office, of which Shymansky is co-director, and that would be that.
But Margolis sat Shymansky down, told him what led her to transfer to Georgetown and said why she thought she could run for GUSA’s highest position, the presidency. Then Margolis asked Shymansky to be her running mate.
“Truthfully, I was, first of all, pleased that she was running,” Shymansky said. “And that’s how the meeting started. And then she asked me to run with her, and I was even more startled.”
After Shymansky said yes, the gears of the nascent campaign started moving quickly. Preston Marquis (SFS ’16) was selected as campaign manager, a team was put together and an eventual 48-page platform was drafted. Margolis and Shymansky selected Marquis, who is GUSA treasurer and an NSO coordinator, for his calm and encouraging personality, among other attributes.
“Preston is the thread that holds our team together and ensures we stay grounded,” Margolis wrote in an email. “We knew he would do just this. Plus he’s an awesome guy and a super human.”
With some tickets having made GUSA executive ambitions clandestinely known months before, a number of people were taken aback when they heard Margolis and Shymansky were running.
“I was shocked but not surprised, just because it was so sudden,” Marquis said, referring to when he heard about the pair’s GUSA ambitions. “They were folks who took the time to think about whether or not it was the right call for them to make. They came to that realization perhaps just a little bit later than some of the other folks just because, I think, they wanted to really reflect and contemplate what they could really bring to the student government.”
Their campaign focuses on Georgetown’s marginalized student groups. Groups from the LGBTQ community to the transfer students to entrepreneurs are considered in the pair’s extensive platform.
For Margolis, fighting for marginalized groups is personal.
Margolis suffers from severe dyslexia and could not read until she was eight. She rarely talks about her learning disability because of the stigma surrounding it, but she said she feels it is an essential part of who she is.
“I think my dyslexia is one of my greatest strengths because if I weren’t dyslexic, I would not be as persevering, I would not be as hard working, I would not be as organized,” Margolis said. “These are all things that I developed as a kid as a coping mechanism. And as I’ve overcome my dyslexia, I’ve kept these traits.”
Every Sunday night, when the GUSA Cabinet convenes to give progress updates, those character traits show through in Margolis, according to friend and campaign staffer Olivia Hinerfeld (SFS ’17), who serves as undersecretary of neighborhood relations in the GUSA cabinet. Hinerfeld said that she always sat in amazement each week as Margolis listed off her accomplishments.
“I’m impressed with everybody in the cabinet,” Hinerfeld said. “People are doing a lot. But it’s always when it gets to Sara. All of us will have maybe one or two updates and then Sara has a list of maybe six major accomplishments that she’s had in the past week.”
Shymansky, Margolis’ running mate, was also impressed by Margolis’ weekly accomplishments.
“Every single cabinet meeting she’d be rattling of some list of what she has accomplished earlier that week,” Shymansky said. “It was that she either had an admitted transfer student day or she got [Residential] Living to agree to leave some rooms off for incoming transfer juniors. It kind of shocks you after a while because nobody else has that sort of regular progress.”
Margolis, who hails from North Carolina, was motivated in her job as secretary of transfer affairs by her own experience as a transfer at Georgetown. After being rejected by Georgetown during her senior year of high school, Margolis attended George Washington University before transferring to Georgetown in 2013. As a transfer, she saw a number of friends have difficult transitions.
“A lot of students, especially those from schools that are not four-year institutions, and even students who did come from four-year institutions, really struggle academically at Georgetown. They’re not given good peer advising,” Margolis said.
Margolis also said that there is a culture at Georgetown where students do not make enough of an effort to reach out to transfers. Margolis hopes to change that.
But perhaps the biggest thing that Margolis and Shymansky call for in their platform is the creation of a $5 million Student Activities Capital Campaign that would raise $2.75 million in just 5 years by partnering with campus organizations such as the Alumni Association, the Office of Advancement and the 1634 Society to solicit donations from alumni. The funds would go toward funding student groups.
“Everybody knows the problem exists,” Shymansky said referring to how student groups are currently funded. “SAC [Student Activities Commission] is going to meet 71.8 percent of funding requests this semester. That’s just insufficient. That’s 30 percent of programming ideas that are just going unsubstantiated because there’s no funding for it.”
The plan has been criticized by some students and alumni regarding its feasibility and whether it goes beyond GUSA’s reach. Another major concern is that the campaign will cause alumni donations to the university’s capital campaign to falter.
“I think there are a lot of alumni who don’t give at all because they don’t want to just give to Georgetown, they want to give to groups that they were a part of,” Margolis said in response to the criticism. “So, I think this [capital campaign] wouldn’t necessarily take away from alumni who are giving to the general capital campaign. … This taps into a whole different kind of alumni.”
Shymansky currently serves as a student representative on the Alumni Board of Governors, which gives him a unique perspective on the issue.
Margolis and Shymansky’s platform also calls for an increased $5,000 in finances for the GUSA Fund, which distributes money to student groups, including those not recognized by the university.
One of the organizations that would potentially benefit from the increased funding is Cups for Campus, a student group that plans to provide free cups for parties so that they can raise awareness about the dangers of sharing cups.
“We were talking to a group called Cups for Campus, and they’re awesome,” Shymansky said. “They want to provide free cups, basically, for parties because Solo cups are really cheap. We had a meningitis [case] earlier this year. There are serious health risks with sharing cups like that and so if you can make it so that people don’t have to budget so tightly for cups, we can kind of provide that.”
Cups for Campus co-founder Chantal Durgana (NHS ’17) said that the organization met with Margolis and Shymansky to discuss possibilities for funding from GUSA.
“I think [Margolis and Shymansky] are really qualified,” Durgana said. “When they were talking to us about their platform and what they want to try and do for students and the university, I was really impressed and really interested in the way that they want to approach student funding in general.”
Other key components of the pair’s platform, which can be found on their campaign website, include housing reform, more access to mental health resources, expansion of food options and including the cost of laundry and printing in tuition.
Now, nearly three months after their initial conversation at Saxby’s, Margolis and Shymansky are in full-swing campaign mode in anticipation of the elections at the end of this month.
“We really do believe in every single student here,” Shymansky said of his campaign. “I think that the issue is that sometimes when people talk about what is the ‘exec’ going to do on its own, I think part of the ‘exec’ functioning well is believing in students to go out and change things.”

The five presidential candidates in the Georgetown University Student Association executive race participated in a heated debate Monday evening in the Healey Family Student Center.
The debate featured presidential candidates Chris Wadibia (COL ’16), Abbey McNaughton (COL ’16), Tim Rosenberger (COL ’16), Sara Margolis (COL ’16) and Joe Luther (COL ’16). GUSA Election Commissioner Pavan Rajgopal (SFS ’14) moderated the debate, which featured questions from members of campus media and the GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee, as well as those posed through Twitter and written on paper by members of the audience.
Indicative of the divisive nature of this GUSA executive race, supporters of all campaigns flooded the venue, providing resounding applause as candidates made statements. The debate also uncharacteristically provided a venue for candidates to address issues of the character of other candidates, integrity and elitism, with broad generalizations often receiving vocal objections by the crowd. At points, Rajgopal was forced to ask the audience to stifle applause in order to maintain the continuity of the debate.
Opening Statements
The debate began with five-minute opening statements from each candidate.
Margolis, a transfer student from George Washington University, started by explaining her unconventional path to Georgetown, her experience in transfer student advocacy as GUSA’s first Secretary of Transfer Affairs and her and running mate Ryan Shymansky’s (COL ’16) passion for social justice issues and connecting with students through advocacy.
“The strength of our platform comes from acknowledging what GUSA can do on its own and on day one — what we can only achieve through collaboration and advocacy work — and what we can begin to do throughout our term to lay the groundwork for the future,” Margolis said. “I am running for GUSA because I believe every student on the Hilltop deserves an advocate.”
Luther, who initiated his opening statement by ripping up a prepared speech, explained his and running mate Connor Rohan’s (COL ’16) motivation for running for GUSA executive, the legitimacy of their candidacy and their vision for the Georgetown of the future.
"I saw GUSA as a cesspool of self-indulgence. And I thought, 'I want in.'" – Luther #GUSA2015

“The position of GUSA executive is about informing the student body and advocating for them; in order to do that you need an administration that is committed to transparency and to mobilizing the student body about things that they care about,” Luther said.
Rosenberger opened by explaining the significance of the GUSA executive role, the importance of electing an executive that will take bold action and his passion for promoting student funding reform and bringing a voice to students who are underrepresented on campus.
“We have the solutions and we have the vision that will make this university better,” Rosenberger said. “We have a vision that should make you excited about GUSA, because we will be a GUSA that actually matters.”
McNaughton discussed her top policy concerns in her opening statement, citing funding, sexual assault and mental health reforms, as well as her and running mate Will Simons’ (COL ’16) qualifications and plan for representing all communities at Georgetown as executives.
“What matters is who’s in the room when the decisions are made; look at our platform, look at our campaign … we are about changing who’s in the room when the decisions are made,” McNaughton said. “Now more than ever, we need a strong, unified and pluralistic voice.”
Wadibia opened by explaining his experiences in the campaign so far, citing this past week as “the worst week of [his] life.” Wadibia said that he was accused of being a homophobe, that his social media posts were flagged for pornography and that he saw his campaign banner in Red Square torn down multiple times.
“I have been accused of being homophobic. … I have been accused of being pro-sexual assault, yet every individual on this campus knows that when I speak to persons — particularly women — I speak to every individual with respect,” Wadibia said.
Wadibia concluded by explaining his intentions for becoming GUSA executive, outlining his experience working with 11 administrators to create his platform and emphasizing his desire to change the attitude and reputation of the association.
“Most students look down upon the student association because the student association looks down upon them,” Wadibia said. “Unless you elect an individual that has a heart for people, GUSA will remain the same.”
Media Questions
Candidates then answered questions from campus media outlets The Georgetown Voice and The Hoya — the GUTV representative was absent — as well as from members of the GUSA Finance and Appropriations committee and from students via Twitter and paper. According to Rajgopal, Fin/App asked for a seat at the debates to delve more deeply into the candidate’s budgets.
Candidates were allocated 45 seconds to answer each question. The election commission at its discretion allowed an additional two-minute discussion period per question.
The first question referenced the recently created Designing the Future(s) initiative by University President John J. DeGioia and Provost Robert Groves, asking candidates how they see Georgetown in the future, as well as how aspects of their platforms may influence the university in the coming years.
Wadibia emphasized the importance of not regarding the administration as antagonists in order to affect meaningful change, explaining how he and Cheney’s short platform is achievable and substantive, while reaching the “hearts and minds” of students.
“We must be very careful that we don’t take the adversarial approach towards the administration,” Wadibia said.
McNaughton explained the importance of maintaining what makes Georgetown special, while citing her experience actually working on the Designing the Future(s) initiative over the past few months.
“Wherever Georgetown goes in the next 20, 25 years, we need to make sure that we are maintaining what makes Georgetown special,” McNaughton said. “That can’t happen unless we have the resources available to do it; that can’t happen unless we have a unified, strong student voice.”
Rosenberger took a pragmatic approach to the question, citing specific issues with facilities, housing requirements and study-abroad housing issues, as well as continual funding for academics and scholarships as tantamount to maintaining Georgetown’s prominence in the future.
Margolis emphasized the importance of focusing on the next campus plan, encouraging an agreement with the university to push for additional green space as well as a construction plan that mitigates impact on student life.
Luther answered by highlighting continual student input on university decision-making as incredibly important moving forward as an advocacy body, balancing student and administration goals.
“Georgetown is over 200 years old, but it is never too late for a growth spurt,” Luther said. “The administration has been single-handedly making all the decisions, when we’re the student body who actually goes to school here.”
The candidates were then asked to name a reform made by Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) and Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15) that they would change or eliminate as GUSA executive.
McNaughton emphasized her and Simons’ desire to reform the relationship of the existing multicultural council with student organizations, citing the “multicultural” label as potentially being levied upon student organizations without choice.
Rosenberger explained a need to expand the existing “What’s a Hoya?” program, allocating more money from GUSA to it — as well as expanding the program to transfer students and allowing student groups to host events — while proposing far more liberal criteria necessary to participate.
Margolis also advocated for the reform of the multicultural council, expressing an intent to roll back the council, consult with student groups and create a multicultural advisory board.
Luther said that his southward-bound GPA during the time of Tezel and Jikaria’s administration was something he wanted to roll back but also emphasized a need to garner additional student input when making decisions and encouraging greater transparency in the GUSA executive.
Wadibia also advocated for reform of the multicultural council, citing issues of funding as well as relatability and seeing a need to reform both how and from where multicultural groups receive funding, as well as the input that goes into decisions involving multicultural groups.
Candidates were also asked how their positions as either GUSA outsiders or insiders would influence their ability to relate to the current GUSA senate in order to make policy. The GUSA Finance and Appropriations committee also questioned candidates on where additional money to facilitate “big-ticket items” in their platforms would come from.
Weaknesses
Candidates were also asked what their biggest weaknesses as GUSA executive would be.
Wadibia says weakness is lack of involvement in GUSA. Says "fresh mind" will "change the nature of how GUSA operates." #GUSA2015
— The Hoya (@thehoya) February 17, 2015

McNaughton says weakness is not being able to represent all parts of Georgetown, wants student representation from all of campus. #GUSA2015
— The Hoya (@thehoya) February 17, 2015

Rosenberger says weakness is lack of patience, but that Varghese does have patience, will help with administrators. #GUSA2015
— The Hoya (@thehoya) February 17, 2015

Margolis says weakness is lack of involvement in senate, wants to build and change relationships between executive and senate. #GUSA2015
— The Hoya (@thehoya) February 17, 2015

"I'm like super ticklish." – Luther on his weaknesses. Also cites lack of diversity, wants to bring in multiple perspectives. #GUSA2015
— The Hoya (@thehoya) February 17, 2015

Candidate-Specific Questioning
In the audience-solicited questioning period, candidates were asked questions through Twitter and paper in the format of group questioning as well as candidate-specific questions.
Candidates were asked which solutions in their platform addressed sexual assault reform on campus as well as their plans for unrecognized student groups to receive access to benefits.
In the candidate-specific questioning portion, Margolis was questioned on her and Shymansky’s Student Activities Capital Campaign, explaining that young alumni are not necessarily incentivized to donate to Georgetown. According to Margolis, the campaign would allow alumni to donate specifically to groups with which they had an affiliation during their time at Georgetown.
Margolis was asked by fellow candidates about how she would justify the Student Activities Capital Campaign to the University Office of Advancement.
Margolis says that the goal is not too lofty, other student ideas such as The Corp, GUASFCU have succeeded. #GUSA2015
— The Hoya (@thehoya) February 17, 2015

The commission asked Rosenberger as to the reasoning behind committing to the Georgetown Israel Alliance’s leadership endorsement criteria pledge. Rosenberger said that he carefully considered the petition and that it “absolutely falls under GUSA’s purview.”
Wadibia questioned Rosenberger on potentially siding with one side of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by signing the GIA pledge.
“I have so many friends that are Jewish, and so many friends that are Muslim. … This document has no place in GUSA because it is inherently divisive,” Wadibia said. “You signed that document, you cannot sign the document without taking a stance, it is fundamentally impossible.”
Wadibia says GIA petition "promotes one side of the argument," says document is "divisive." #GUSA2015
— The Hoya (@thehoya) February 17, 2015

Rosenberger countered by mentioning Wadibia’s previously panned sexual assault platform and accused Wadibia of misinformation and not fully understanding the complexity of certain issues.
“You know Chris, you signed the thing and then you reneged. You wrote the sexual assault platform that got panned, then you got hung up for it. … You don’t know what you’re talking about, it’s clear — you keep flip-flopping. … We’re not worried about sexual assault because we think you’re pro-sexual assault — we are worried because we feel unsafe,” Rosenberger said. “We wouldn’t feel safe with you as GUSA executive.”
Wadibia was questioned as to allegations of not having enough student-leader input in his platform. Wadibia responded by stating that he consulted with student leaders from many student groups, and wrote his platform together with such leaders.
“The reason that my platform is succinct and yet powerful is because every part of my platform reaches out to all students,” Wadibia stated.
Rosenberger responded by stating that he is on the board of GU Pride and that Wadibia did not attempt to garner input from the organization.
Rosenberger: "Chris, I'm on the board of GU Pride, and you didn't talk to us." Asks why they weren't asked to contribute to platform.
— The Hoya (@thehoya) February 17, 2015

Wadibia explained that Rosenberger’s claims were unfounded and explained that his character is what set him apart from his fellow candidates.
“The reason each of these candidates cannot be elected is that they don’t have the character to lead,” Wadibia said.
Wadibia also questioned Luther and his ability to perform administrative duties as GUSA executive while connecting with certain communities on campus.
Luther responded by saying that a candidate cannot go into the executive race knowing everything, and that he and Rohan will advocate for “all students.”
Luther says "95 percent of the process that goes behind comedy is hard work," that he will take the campaign seriously. #GUSA2015
— The Hoya (@thehoya) February 17, 2015

 
Wadibia responded by questioning Luther’s competency to lead, asking him to explain the difference between the Black Student Alliance and National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, saying that “leadership must be rooted in experience.”
“You have a talent, Joe, that is humor. But it is sad because that is the only talent that you have,” Wadibia said.
"I'm the campus jester but that's a clown move." – Luther to Wadibia on sexual assault platform. #GUSA2015
— The Hoya (@thehoya) February 17, 2015

McNaughton was questioned as to how her experience as a student representative to the university board of directors would prepare her to lead as GUSA executive and responded that her experience is beneficial, as she worked on issues that affected students directly, albeit admitting that there is still much work to do in regards to student-administrator dialogue.
Candidates ended the debate with 2.5-minute closing statements to end the nearly two-hour long event.
The GUSA executive election voting will commence Wednesday night. Ballot links will be sent through HoyaMail.

I thought Tim was probably the most impressive, although he’s probably not a frontrunner for the actual election. He handled himself well and brought up a lot of good points. Luther also did a great job of combining humor and real platform points, although his comments tended to be brief.
I thought it was ironic that Chris built his entire campaign around his personal character and dignity, and then proceeded to mudsling far more than any other candidate. He attacked Sara despite having cross-endorsed with her early. In addition, his questioning of Luther was amateurish and unnecessary. Not only did he look ridiculous when Luther knew the difference between the BSA and and the NAACP, but the question itself was absurd. His comments about Joe having only one talent were openly hostile, and totally betrayed the entire premise of his opening remarks about getting to know people personally. 
It’s safe to say that the GIA discussion was ridiculous, which I think Joe summarized nicely. Chris’s questioning of Tim on the topic is ludicrous considering that he signed and then reneged. Tim seemed far more educated about what the agreement entailed. 
I thought the highlight of the debate was Tim’s closing when he totally put Chris’s “worst week of my life” comments in perspective and generally poked fun at Chris’s repeated attempt to mark GUSA as elitist.

Sara and Ryan do know that we already have the ability to give back to student groups, right? I’ve been giving back to one of my student groups since graduation through the fundraising emails.

Exactly! I don’t understand why they’re just decentralizing the process. The rest of their platform is pretty solid but they lose my vote because of this. I’m voting Abby/Will or Tim/Reno.

Debate Attendee says 
February 17, 2015 at 1:36 pm
Something I thought was pretty telling about how the debate was received: each candidate besides Chris received a small amount of applause from everyone in the room after their closing statements. Chris received a raucous standing ovation from his campaign team, while no one else even thought of clapping. I guess no one else wants to support a guy who says he was personally attacked this week, then proceeds to personally attack all the other candidates.

I genuinely hope Sara Margolis doesn’t win. My few interactions with her have shown her to be rude, cold, and unapproachable. The only thing special that her ticket brings is the capital project, which will fail miserably, because this proposed project already exists. Decentralizing a fundraising center is completely useless and will do more harm than good. Unfortunately, Ms. Margolis is not familiar with the school’s current funding system. She seems to know very little about very important issues. Her familiarity with dining is sad. Most freshmen will and always will care about the dining options on campus. GET ME BETTER FOOD GUSA!!! Unfortunately, she really doesn’t know anything about dining, so you can expect her/her crew not to make any changes on that front next year. Her little dig at the GUSA Senate was very exclusivist. I mean how can she claim to not have any familiarity with a whole branch of GUSA when she claims she’s super involved with GUSA?! I feel like the exec wasted a lot of their efforts on a failed Multicultural Advisory Board (that’s all I’ve ever read about them in campus media…) and the same will happen next year with Sara’s capital  project. Aside from transfer affairs, Ms. Margolis doesn’t seem to be very informed about the core issues. I do think Chris’ elitist dig does sort of apply to the Margolis-Schmansky ticket.

NotIgnorantFreshman says 
February 17, 2015 at 5:16 pm
I suggest before making baseless claims, I would read their platform. Their meal-plan ideas are extensive. The platform covers Leo’s problems in detail and offers several solutions. In fact, it is one of the main freshman focuses of the Marmansky campaign, so your claim is utterly invalid and only shows blatant ignorance of the realities of the GUSA campaigns. This is not to say that other tickets do not support meal plan changes, but to say that Leo’s is not on their radar is just entirely wrong. For more detailed information about this, see page 23 of their platform found on their website. As for her experience in GUSA, an attack on minimal experience on the exec is applicable to almost all of the candidates. Once again, for someone who claims that Sara is uninformed about core issues should refer to a very detailed and passionate platform full of feasible and delineated ideas.

Huh? says 
February 17, 2015 at 10:47 pm
What is a marmansky campaign?

MARgolis + shyMANSKY = marmansky, it’s just a nickname using their last names

Although you’re probably working for a campaign that’s competing against Sara and Ryan, and are therefore not an impartial observer – I have to concur.  There is a frustrating, frightening misunderstanding of the issues in this GUSA Campaign.  Sara and Ryan’s funding reform looks great on paper but is impractical, Chris and Meredith are running on vague platitudes, Abbey and Will have great individual ideas but no big signature one that they’ve pushed, and Tim and Reno are lagging so far behind in support that they’re resorting to reverse hit jobs in arcane internet publications.  Finally, you’ve got similarly good ideas from the Luther-Rohan camp, but no big headliners.  At least they’re entertaining though.
The entertaining part here is that this one is shaping up to be a 3 1/2 to 4 horse race – Abbey/Will, Sara/Ryan, Luther/Rohan, and Chris/Meredith if the fireworks at last night’s debate don’t hurt them too much.  Here’s hoping for a barn burner.

I think Sara and Abbey have similar platforms, but I’m voting Abbey because I don’t think the capital project is doable.

Can someone explain what dignity means to Chris Wadibia?
It does not mean arrogance.
It does not mean that you don’t have to do the footwork to built a legitimate platform.
This is some foolishness.

The award for the most hyperbolic comment of the night must go to Rosenberger:  
“We’re not worried about sexual assault because we think you’re pro-sexual assault — we are worried because we feel unsafe,” Rosenberger said. “We wouldn’t feel safe with you as GUSA executive.”
Seriously, dude?  If you are so unmanly that the you feel “”unsafe” on campus and need to verbalize that you wouldn’t feel safe with Chris as president, then you’re not strong enough to lead the students of Georgetown and perhaps you should get some counseling.  Wow.  And I say that as a Luther-Rohan supporter.  To be fair, Chris showed himself not worthy of the presidency either with his whiny performance, his attacks, and his race-baiting with the BSA/NAACP question. 
The sad thing about McNaughton is she revealed her feminists alliances and proved how the group that yells the loudest get the most attention by citing as her top policy concerns as sexual assault and mental health issues, both of which affect a small subset of students (spare me the “sexual assault is everyone’s problem” line . . . so is poverty, racism, and every other social ill . . . we live in a world with limited time and resources and GUSA has very limited power, so the time, attention, and influence of the GUSA executive can be better used elsewhere).  Bottom line, if you’re a man, you shouldn’t be voting for McNaughton.
Margolis came off sounding the best b/c of the student funds allocation thing, but GUSA is a joke so don’t vote for her, though if Luther-Rohan weren’t running she would be the best.
VOTE LUTHER-ROHAN!

I think it’s unfair to label McNaughton as a feminist that caters to “groups that yell the loudest”. I think it’s refreshing to see a GUSA representative (specifically a Republican) that wants to place some emphasis on creating a safer and happier campus. That obviously won’t be her sole purpose–they have a pretty extensive platform that you may want to look into.

The debate on Monday proved just about everything that is wrong with Georgetown. And GUSA.
