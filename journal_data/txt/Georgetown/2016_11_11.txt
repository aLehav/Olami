Six Georgetown alumni were newly elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and one to the U.S. Senate in Tuesday’s Congressional elections.
The six alumni entering the House of Representatives are Democrat Stephanie Murphy of Florida (GRD ’04), Republican Francis Rooney of Florida (CAS ’75, GRD ’78), Republican Trey Hollingsworth of Indiana (GRD ’14), Republican John Faso of New York (GRD ’79), Republican Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin (GRD ’12, GRD ’13) and Democrat Pramila Jayapal of Washington (CAS ’86).
Jayapal will become the first Indian-American woman to serve in the U.S. House after succeeding Democrat Jim McDermott as the representative for Washington’s 7th district.
Democrat Chris Van Hollen of Maryland (GRD ’90) will join six incumbent alumni in the Senate, including Democrat Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont (GRD ’64) and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska (CAS ’80), who won re-election in their states Tuesday.
These alumni join a total of 22 members in the House and Senate in the 115th Congress who hold degrees from Georgetown, composed of 16 Democrats and six Republicans.
Republican Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois (GRD ’92) is the only incumbent alumnus who did not win his re-election bid. Kirk lost to his Democratic opponent, Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth from Illinois’ 8th district.
Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming expressed pride in the alumni serving in Congress.
“Of course we are tremendously proud of these members of the Georgetown community who are, through public service, living our mission of educating men and women for others,” Fleming said. “We look forward to connecting them to university life as they assume their new positions.”
Government professor James Lengle said he consistently donates his own money to help elect Georgetown graduates.
“I’ve always contributed money to former students of mine who ran for public office regardless of political party. It’s my way of supporting and encouraging their commitment to public service,” Lengle said. “I’m very proud when Georgetown graduates act on ideals instilled by their education and by the values and mission of the university.

Georgetown students protested President-elect Donald Trump’s victory over former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton early Wednesday morning in front of the White House and the Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C., later that evening.
Students made their way down to the White House as early as 12 a.m. Wednesday morning, as it became clear that Trump would gather enough votes from the electoral college to become the next president. They were joined by more than 300 others, including students from The George Washington University, American University and Catholic University, in protest, celebration or observation on Pennsylvania Avenue.
As Trump, Clinton and President Barack Obama called for unity and a peaceful transition of power following the results of the election, protests erupted across the nation, particularly at college campuses. The Georgetown University Police Department has not changed its security precautions, according to GUPD Chief Jay Gruber.
Election Night
One of the students who travelled to the White House, Daniel O’Sullivan (MSB ’20), said he wanted to gauge how the American people would react to the prospect of a Trump presidency.
“Mostly I wanted to see history. I wanted to be down here, I wanted to see what the mood of the country was,” O’Sullivan said. “I’ve seen people really being vicious towards each other, like having to hold each other back, and just shouting matches.”
Maggie Cirrulo (COL ’17), who also headed to the White House, was not there to observe but to celebrate.
“Why we are here tonight is we are celebrating democracy and we are celebrating the Republican Party,” Cirrulo said. “We are very excited about tonight. People think that young people don’t vote for Trump. Well, we did.”
As Trump’s victory became increasingly cemented, peaceful demonstrations by attendees against Trump turned into emotionally charged confrontations.
At 1:45 a.m., a protester from the nonpartisan youth group United We Dream, which interrupted Secretary of State Jeh Johnson’s commencement speech at the School of Foreign Service’s 2016 graduation, displayed a large “Donald Trump is a Racist” banner and began shouting through a megaphone.
“Stop targeting the undocumented community. Stop targeting my black brothers and sisters. Stop targeting my Muslim brothers and sisters. Stop targeting the LGBT community,” the protester said.
As many swing states, including Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin, among others, were called as victories for Trump, students watched on campus in the Healey Family Student Center at an event hosted by Georgetown’s Institute of Politics and Public Service.
Clinton supporter Millie Spencer (SFS ’20), who had been watching the returns in HFSC, said she became too emotional to wait for the final results.
“I’m going to bed. I’ve cried enough and been frustrated enough for like hours and the only thing that’s left to do is get fired up about the fact that we go to a school that cares about politics and social justice,” Spencer said.
On Wednesday night, students joined several hundred others to congregate at the U Street metro station and walk to the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue.
Molly Dunlap (SFS ’19), who attended the protest, described the moment the police overtook their march. Dunlap said she originally thought the police would attempt to stop them, but was instead surprised at their assistance.
“We were walking around and all of a sudden police sirens came from behind and we were all like, ‘Oh they’re coming to stop us,’ but they actually cleared the way for us,” Dunlap said.
Dunlap added that she attended the protest because of her desire to demonstrate her dissatisfaction with the election results.
“What I really liked about the protest was that it was not a bunch of drunk students getting together, because that is a tradition they do every year, but this was people who actually care, who are actually motivated, who went out of their way to mobilize and attend demonstrations,” Dunlap said.
Taking a Step Back 
Though students and professors expressed surprise at Trump’s victory Tuesday, government professor James Lengle said the polls accurately predicted the results of the popular vote, which favored Clinton over Trump 47.7 percent to 47.5 percent. However, Clinton garnered 228 of the necessary 270 Electoral College votes while Trump won with 290 Electoral College votes. This marks the fourth time in America’s history that a presidential candidate has lost the popular vote but won the election.
“In some ways, the poll was reflective of the results, in that Clinton, it appears, has won more popular votes than Donald Trump and that was what polling going into the election had shown,” Lengle said. “They did predict the popular vote winner.”
In reference to Trump’s victory, Lengle highlighted three reasons he believed Trump won — the Republican Party uniting behind him, Clinton’s lack of support from minority communities that previously supported Barack Obama and Trump gaining the backing of the Independent Party.
According to Lengle, because Trump’s views differ from the agendas of many politicians in the Republican Party establishment, he will have to compromise with the Republican-controlled Congress in order to advance his campaign promises.
“He will, in some way, have to adjust to Senate and House Republicans’ views in order to get some degree of his public policy through,” Lengle said. “He’s going to learn awfully quickly that the institutions of American politics are more powerful than an individual. He will have to learn to play within the institutional context and restraints of the political system.”
The Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life and GU Politics hosted a panel Thursday night in Gaston Hall examining the results of the election.
Robert Costa, a national political reporter for The Washington Post and a panelist at the event, attributed Trump’s victory to the rise of populism.
“The populism that I first heard from him so long ago, it truly embraced him,” Costa said. “That is what really lifted him to the White House, thanks to working-class white voters in places like Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania.”
Michael Gerson, a columnist for The Washington Post and another panelist, concurred, warning that the current climate could lead to increased divisions in associations outside of politics.
“The result is pretty dangerous for our public life,” Gerson said. “It has been a hostile takeover of the Republican Party by a populous movement. It has turned a lot of our conflicts in America, conflicts of ideology, increasingly into conflicts of class that are deeply destructive to the fabric of country.”
Gerson added that he had come to realize how disengaged he was from much of the country given the surprising nature of the election’s outcome.
“The first lesson I have drawn is humility and the second is humility,” Gerson said. “The fact of the matter was that there was an elite world that is entirely disconnected from what was going on in the country.”
McCourt School of Public Policy professor E.J. Dionne, another panelist, expressed hope that Democrats could work together to bridge the separation between different communities in the country.
“The Democratic Party needs now what it has always needed, which it is a strategy, a set of policies and a set of candidates who can bring together a significant part of the white working class with African-Americans and now our growing Latino population. In principle, that is very possible,” Dionne said. “We are reminded that the white working class cannot be forgotten about.”

Students and politicians in Congress must work to check President-elect Donald Trump’s power, according to students from political campus groups in light of Trump’s victory over former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton on Tuesday.
Tuesday’s election results were met with heightened tensions on campus Wednesday and Thursday. The Institute of Politics and Public Service brought in six chaplains to offer support to students as they followed the election results in the Healey Family Student Center on Tuesday evening. Counseling and Psychiatric Services also ensured that one or more staff members were available each hour Wednesday during office hours, according to CAPS Director Phil Meilman.
Protestant Chaplain Rev. Brandon Harris recognized Tuesday night as emotional for many students.
“We are here to provide spiritual resources and support for students across political affiliations as a way to provide counseling, somebody to talk to and just a listening ear,” Harris said. “There are a lot of emotions in this election, so we will listen to everyone.”
Some students already seeing CAPS asked for appointments to be moved up, but there has been no increase in first-time visits, according to Meilman.
Clara Mejia Orta (COL ’17), who is a student without documentation, said Trump’s victory represents a victory for a fear-based campaign.
“During the past eighteen months, I have heard our stories being reduced to numbers, our struggles reduced to ‘those people,’ and our power overshadowed by the criminalization of our dreams,” Orta wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The outcome of this election is a reflection of the unfounded fear of the other — Undocumented, Queer, Muslim, Latinx, Black, Disabled, Trans, Womxn.”
Students in the Muslim Students Association have been focusing on self-care in light of Trump’s election, according to MSA Chair Khadija Mohamud (SFS ’17).
“The reality that there can be this much hate and ignorance and fear incited and reinforced in terms of the rhetoric that’s been used through this entire election, and the culmination of the results that have happened, it’s very disheartening. ” Mohamud said.
Mohamud said despite the current heightened racial climate in the United States, the university community remains accepting of her and other Muslims.
“One thing that I can say that is really beautiful about the Georgetown community is that I have never received so many texts from friends who are non-Muslim, friends who are my classmates or haven’t spoken to in a long time who care so much and check up on me,” Mohamud said.
Campaign group Hoyas for Hillary President Grant Olson (COL ’19) said the loss is a setback to Obama’s achievements.
“It was such a blow, because this generation on college campuses right now, it’s probably their first experiences after seeing this drumbeat of succession of things happening first black president elected, gay marriage — but I think people got complacent,” Olson said.
Olson also said Democrats failed to realize many Americans’ desire for concrete change against establishment politics.
“We ignored her, and the fact that there was a very real, very present feeling among a lot of the country that it was time for radical change,” Olson said. “We were all in tears. We were all sobbing. We were all in shock.”
The result was shocking to student groups on both sides of the political spectrum. Georgetown College Republicans Vice Chair Sam Granville (COL ’17) said conservatives on campus hold similar values to other students, even in light of Trump’s victory.
“Tuesday night was really hard. I’ve spent the last year and half trying to convince people that not all Republicans are filled with hate, that not all Republicans are Trump supporters,” Granville wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I just hope my Georgetown peers know that I am equally as upset as they are and as ready to fight for our American values as they are.”
GUCR Chair Megan Pohl (COL ’17) said the group will look to create a positive, open dialogue on campus.
“We will continue in the spirit of this past year by engaging in conversations, inviting discourse, and providing forums for discussion,” Pohl wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are not a party of xenophobes, homophobes, racists, sexists. We are not a party of hatred.”
Trump’s victory has made campus political groups rethink their goals. Olson said Hoyas for Hillary will look for ways to organize against Trump and his policies with which they disagree.
“It’ll take a little time – I’m going to take some time – but I want to come back and start making change and keeping this White House in check,” Olson said. “We can really do a lot of great things; I know we can. I’m not sure where this is going to go, but I know that in the coming days and weeks we’ll figure out exactly what needs to be done and what we need to do for the future.”
In particular, H*yas for Choice Co-President Brinna Ludwig (NHS ’17) said Trump’s victory has made her rethink the political nature of the organization.
“I never had thought of Hoyas for Choice as a partisan organization, but I had a realization that in the state of politics today, we have no choice but to be partisan,” Ludwig said. “The Republican Party is now the anti-choice party, I mean there are a few pro-choice Republicans, but they’re very few and far between.”
Marco Garcia (SFS ’19) said campus has to look the future with optimism.
“I am ecstatic that Trump won the election,” Garcia wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Campus has become so melancholic and somber, and, in my opinion, it’s pitiful.”
Pohl said students must work together to ensure Trump is the president he promised to be in his victory speech.
“If Donald Trump truly desires to ‘Make America Great Again,’ that includes making it great for the entire nation,” Pohl said. “It will not be easy going forward, but I do not believe that hope is lost. We must all remain politically engaged, raise our voices in the name of what we believe in, and work together.”

Students are going barefoot to raise awareness for workers’ rights violations committed by Nike, a licensee of the university, as part of a demonstration arranged by the workers’ rights advocacy group Georgetown Solidarity Committee from Wednesday to Friday.
The university has been in contract negotiations with Nike to allow the company to use the school’s name and logo before the conrtact expires Dec. 31. GSC has advocated for Nike to sign the Code of Conduct for University Licensees, which is a requirement for all university vendors, before renewing the contract.
As part of the three-day demonstration publicized on Facebook, named “Better Barefoot Than Nike,” GSC has requested that senior university administrators, including University President John J. DeGioia and his Chief of Staff Joseph Ferrara, take off their shoes.
No university administrators have participated in the demonstration as of 2:30 a.m.
The code of conduct for licensees includes several clauses related to labor standards, including wages and benefits, health and safety and harassment and abuse. The code also stipulates that workers will cooperate with the Workers’ Rights Consortium, which helps enforce Georgetown’s and other universities’ code of conduct.
Nike has so far declined to sign the code. In a Nov. 17, 2015 memo to member universities including Georgetown, the Workers’ Rights Consortium said that Nike had rejected a request to inspect the Hansae factory, a Nike factory in Vietnam.
Nike has also been criticized for making use of child labor overseas, in addition to other workers’ rights violations.
According to Lillian Ryan (COL ’18), who is participating in the demonstration and is a former member of the nine-person university licensing oversight committee, which advises the university on issues related to licensing, there are also reports of Nike firing pregnant women and unsafe work conditions.
The LOC recommended in late March 2016 that the university require Nike to sign its code of conduct and that Nike open its factories to the WRC.
GSC member David Kilbridge (COL ’20) said the campaign aims to hold both Nike and Georgetown accountable.
“I don’t really feel good necessarily being a part of an institution, being a part of a university, that either explicitly or implicitly, through its contract with Nike, supports the mistreatment of workers this way,” Ryan said. “When it comes to this protest, I think what we’re trying to do is raise awareness, both among the students and among the staff, that we are not OK with this.”
Ryan said Nike must pledge to share Georgetown’s values before the contract is renewed.
“It’s all part of a process that we want Nike to be able to sign onto our code of conduct. They need to share our values, or we don’t want the Georgetown name on their brand,” Ryan said.
GSC member Kory Stuer (COL ’19), who is participating in the protest, said Georgetown, as a leader within the university community on workers’ rights, needs to set a good example with its policies.
“Georgetown, on issues about workers’ and labor rights, has been a leader nationally for years. If Georgetown decides to work with Nike, other schools will follow suit and act like this behavior is acceptable,” Stuer said.
According to Ryan, the code of conduct should be the minimum requirement for companies working with Georgetown.
“Nike should either sign the code of conduct or be cut as a licensee,” Ryan said. “The particular area in the code of conduct we’re focused on is the monitoring by the workers’ rights consortium. But I think it’s pretty easy. All our licensees have signed the code of conduct except for Nike.”
Stuer said going barefoot is an easy yet provocative way to draw attention to this issue.
“The act of going barefoot is so simple to ask of students,” Stuer said. “It might be a little bit uncomfortable to walk around in the cold and on the hard concrete, but to compare that to what workers have to go through in order to produce Georgetown products, it’s nothing. We’re not passing out from heat exhaustion, or being systematically fired because of a pregnancy.”
Ryan said she hopes the campaign will force the university to take concrete action in addressing the issue with Nike.
“We want the university to be tougher. It seems like the university is receptive. They hear where we’re coming from, but it hasn’t been translated into action, and it’s been a year,” Ryan said. “We’ve held multiple actions and I think both the university and Nike are stringing things out. We want to show that students really care about this enough to go out barefoot in the snow and the rain.”

Undergraduate students will vote on a campuswide referendum to abolish the Georgetown University Student Association senate and replace it with a new elected assembly Dec. 1, after the senate voted 21-6 last night in support of the proposal.
GUSA Senate Speaker Richie Mullaney (COL ’18) presented the final version of the restructuring plan to 27 gathered senators and four representatives from the Council of Advisory Boards, the Advisory Board on Club Sports, the Campus Ministry Student Forum and the Lecture Fund.
The final plan would establish a new assembly comprising student advisory board delegates and four student representatives elected based on class year. The proposed assembly would determine student organization funding, a role currently administered by the Finance and Appropriations Committee, known as Fin/App, within the senate.
The responsibility over policy-related issues will shift to policy teams created following GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and Vice President Chris Fisk’s (COL ’17) election consisting of leaders and members appointed by the GUSA executive and senate.
The referendum will present students with “yes” and “no” responses on a ballot.
Fin/App Chair Owen Hayes (COL ’18) said the final proposal will cement the role of advisory boards in the appropriations process.
“What it does to change the constitution enshrines the advisory boards and major groups that receive funding in the funding process,” Hayes said. “That is put in the constitution and because of the threshold to change the constitution, that is going to be very hard to reverse and those groups need to be part of the process, so the fact that they can’t be cut out easily going forward is a very important step.”
Senator Saad Bashir (COL ’19), who voted against the plan, said the new assembly would reduce opportunities for new students to participate in student government.
“GUSA senate was actually a great way for me to get involved with campus as a freshman, but as it is constantly being changed, I don’t see the new assembly providing new students the same opportunities that I was able to have and use,” Bashir said.
Senator Jasmin Ouseph (SFS ’19), who also voted against the proposal, said the final draft of the constitution will be too dense for students to understand, since even some senators could not understand the text.
“The constitution is dense material and I know senators who couldn’t even fully and appropriately understand the nuances of it all so I don’t know how informed the student body’s vote actually will be,” Ouseph wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The senate voted to hold a campuswide referendum for students to express support or opposition to a smoke-free campus, which will also be held Dec. 1. Ouseph said holding the smoke-free referendum on the same day will likely improve turnout and benefit supporters of the restructuring.
Senator Ben Baldwin (SFS ’19), who supported the proposal, said the final version is a compromise between competing concerns.
“I believe that this plan represents the best compromise between the current system of club funding and the issues that countless advisory boards and student organizations have raised against it,” Baldwin wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This plan institutionalizes collaboration between objective, elected representatives from the student body and the institutional experts leading advisory boards and student organizations.”

About 320 members of the Georgetown community have signed a petition calling for the university to launch a disabilities studies minor as of Oct. 27.
The petition, which was created by the Georgetown University Student Association, is looking to push the university to establish an interdisciplinary disability studies minor as a potential six-course academic discipline that will examine issues of identity, body and community through a foundational course, a capstone and electives.
The disability studies program currently exists as a course cluster, with over 200 students enrolled in its seven classes this semester. The course cluster, which is housed in the college, first launched last fall with three classes that engaged students in monthly lectures and interactive workshops with scholars in the field.
GUSA Accessibility Policy Chair Danielle Zamalin (NHS ’18) said although the course cluster already has the funding and number of classes required to constitute a minor, the petition’s goal is to demonstrate to the Office of the Provost that there is enough student interest to formally transition the course cluster to a minor.
“We’ve had a lot of faculty in the course cluster who support the petition for a minor, as well as just other faculty that work on the disabilities working group, and they share that with their students,” Zamalin wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Even other than that, we’ve had just other faculty members sign the petition.”
Zamalin said she was heartened to see the petition gain traction among undergraduates prior to the launch of an official campaign for the minor, which is slated to begin today with tabling in Lauinger Library and Sellinger Lounge.
Currently, 75.5 percent of the 324 signatures come from current undergraduates, 3.4 percent from current graduate students, 12.7 percent from alumni, 10.2 percent from faculty and staff and 1 percent from administrators.
“We haven’t done our dorm-storming or tabling campaign, so we expect those numbers to go up really quickly,” Zamalin wrote. “These numbers are purely from people sharing it through Facebook. So, our actual petitioning and lobbying and tabling haven’t even started yet, but our numbers are already really high.”
The African American studies minor was approved by the Main Campus Executive Faculty, a body consisting of 57 faculty members and two students, in 2005 after a multi-year effort.
A group must bring a proposal before the College Deans’ Office to create a minor, according to Senior Associate Dean for Faculty Affairs and Strategic Planning Maria Donoghue. Subsequently, three or four members of the College Academic Council are asked to review the proposal, followed by a vote on approval or disapproval by the entire executive committee.
Professor of English Libbie Rifkin, who is involved in the Disability Studies Minor Working Group, said challenges remain in attaining the minor. The working group worked with three academic departments to establish the course cluster last fall.
“Some of the issues and challenges we have faced have to do with a broad awareness that disability is an important issue on our campus and that’s an awareness we want to keep generating for the sake of developing a minor and for the sake of creating a more just environment for people with disabilities on campus,” Rifkin said.
Rifkin said a disabilities studies minor would offer an academic discipline similar to other forms of identity studies.
“People with disabilities who have a culture, experiences and a history that is as worthy of study as many of the other interdisciplinary programs that we have like women’s and gender studies and African American studies and U.S. Latino studies,” Rifkin said.
Zamalin said the minor would enhance the diversity of courses available at Georgetown. The MCEF voted in April 2015 to introduce a diversity requirement for the Class of 2020, which requires students to take two courses related to the topic of diversity.
“There’s been a shift in higher education toward diversification, especially at Georgetown with our diversity class requirement. And we’ve embraced that in so many ways,” Zamalin said. “And I think that a marginalized group of Americans and their history and culture often gets ignored.”
Rifkin said disabilities studies helps teach a broader awareness of an issue that can affect everyone.
“Much of what disabilities studies teaches is, first of all, that people with disabilities are part of our human family, and that their claims to rights and justice are important for us to embrace, but also that we are all only temporarily able-bodied, that we will all experience disability if we are lucky to live long enough,” Rifkin said.

According to a food-accessibility survey released by the Georgetown University Student Association, 54 percent of 351 surveyed students said they have experienced hunger but were unable to buy food for cost-related reasons.
The survey points to a lack of accessible food options on campus as 42.2 percent of surveyed students said they experienced hunger without access to food due to cost at least once a week.
Sixty-three percent of the respondents were students on need-based financial aid, while 36 percent were students in the Georgetown Scholarship Program.
According to the survey, three of the main barriers to access food were the time needed to go to a grocery store, the distance required to purchase affordable groceries and the hours of dining options available on campus.
The shortage of affordable food options prevented 68.9 percent of surveyed students from eating as healthily as desired.
GUSA Socioeconomic Inclusivity Policy Team Chair Emily Kaye (COL ’18), who is also a member of the GSP board, said potential solutions include extending O’Donovan Hall’s hours and opening an on-campus food pantry for students. This summer, The George Washington University established a food pantry, where students in need can access free food when they have no other options.
Daniel Marshall (SFS ’19) said it is important to ensure there is no stigma associated with the potential introduction of a food pantry.
“Right now we are trying to figure out what the best plan should be to propose to the administration. Essentially what we are trying to do is isolate the issue that is very apparent within the administration that we don’t have all the resources necessary,” Marshall said.
Marshall said it is important the food pantry be accessible but discrete, to ensure the pantry is useable for all students.
According to Cam White (MSB ’19), who is on the GUSA Socioeconomic Inclusivity Policy Team, the survey results highlight a pressing campus issue that often goes overlooked.
“It’s important because Georgetown, being the inclusive campus that it claims to be, must look at all aspects of the student experience in its pursuit for inclusivity, which definitely extends to food accessibility,” White wrote in an email to The Hoya. “There should not be hungry stomachs at an elite university like Georgetown.”
Following the release of the survey’s results, Kaye met with student leaders including CEO of Students of Georgetown, Inc. Taylor Tobin (COL ’17), Director of Vital Vittles Max Shapiro (COL ’17), GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and GUSA Vice President Chris Fisk (COL ’17) to develop action points.
GUSA is looking into options including Aramark donating its spoilage, Epicurean & Company hosting discount nights to fundraise for food accessibility over breaks at the restaurant and creating a Facebook page of events with free food.
In addition, GUSA is exploring the possibility for students to anonymously transfer meal swipes and researching the feasibility behind Residential Living’s sponsoring kitchenware for residential communities.
The Corp’s external board plans to determine the feasibility of allocating money to invest in food accessibility over breaks for students with high financial need. The Corp will also donate all unsold items to students in need over breaks, according to Kaye.
The Farmers Market has also promised to donate money to the initiative, which GUSA is considering using to buy a freezer to preserve food for students over break.
According to Kaye, the priority for this semester is increasing the available food options for students over breaks.
“Twenty percent of people who took the survey said that they lacked the ability to access food over this break, so we decided to make that a priority, and so right now I’m working with Chris [Fisk] to try and provide more food resources during break,” Kaye said.
Kaye said she is optimistic about the response to the survey results.
“I am astounded by how willing everyone has been to help,” Kaye said. “This really shows that food access isn’t just a one part of the community issue but it is really an entire community issue. It’s nice to see these groups recognize that and I’m hoping this can lead to some lonterm solutions.”

The Georgetown University Student Association Fund, a $15,000 fund intended as last-resort funding for student groups, is looking to grow its budget and shift its focus to be an initial funding source for club events and activities this year.
The fund is allocated annually by the GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee’s student activities budget, which appropriates funds from the student activities fee to student groups. Clubs and groups seeking event funding are able to submit applications, which are then reviewed by a five-person discretionary committee that determines the distribution of funds.
The committee plans to grow the fund’s budget from its current $15,000, according to GUSA Fund Director of Public Relations Olivia Horton (COL ’20).
“We’re having to watch the budget pretty closely, but the goal is that eventually we will be allocated more money,” Horton said.
GUSA Fund Treasurer David Seo (COL ’20) said the committee hopes that increased requests will lead to an increase in funding. The fund would need to receive a larger portion of student activities fees in order for growth to occur, according to Seo.
“Our main goal in growing the fund is to increase awareness of GUSA Fund and its role in fostering student-run events and activities that benefit the Georgetown community,” Seo said.
Though the fund has only been active for about four weeks this academic year, it has already sponsored 10 different events on campus. The fund projects to fund about 40 events this year.
In the past, the GUSA Fund has been known as a source of “last resort funding,” according to its website homepage. Typically, representatives from student organizations apply for funding for their events only during financial strain on a particular event.
Horton said the committee is actively trying to change the nature of the fund.
“One of our goals this year is to make GUSA Fund more of a primary source, so people are coming to us first instead of as a last resort,” Horton said. “Mostly we’re working on getting our name out there and rebranding.”
This rebranding includes partnering directly with more on-campus clubs to sponsor a higher number of annual and recurring events, as well as a greater emphasis on marketing and name recognition.
The fund board members said they are committed to encouraging campus dialogue and supporting programs that highlight social justice issues.
GUSA Fund Chair Aaron Bennett (COL ’19) said spotlighting social justice issues has become the primary focus of the organization.
“This mission that we’ve sort of coalesced around is the idea that we want to shape campus dialogue in ways that promote political justice or social justice and really be a force for good,” Bennett said.
When determining whether an event receives sponsorship, the fund committee looks at factors including accessibility, purpose, need and uniqueness. The committee looks to ensure that they are promoting worthwhile events that have the potential to benefit a significant portion of the Georgetown community, according to Bennett.
“We want to make sure that we’re funding programs that can benefit the entire Georgetown community,” Bennett said. “Is this something that can help everyone, that GUSA can put its name on?”
The GUSA Fund helped sponsor a Lecture Fund event with author and poet Rupi Kaur on Oct. 18. Though the Lecture Fund receives funding from Fin/App, it still required additional support to successfully host the event.
“We felt that it was a need that we could fill and a need that we should fill,” Bennett said. “A lot of organizations could do more with just a little extra money. We want to incentivize them to go for that better program and contribute to the new dialogue on campus.”
The GUSA Fund has supported other organizations, including La Casa Latina, which received money from the fund to purchase food for its members in an event celebrating the dedication of the group
Casa Latina Financial Operations Coordinator Ximena Céspedes (SFS ’19) said receiving funding from GUSA helped establish the group’s relationship with GUSA.
“Having received their help for our event meant a lot to us, as it meant that our community, one that has fought long and hard for our place here on campus, was accepted and supported by GUSA and all the student representatives that comprise it,” Céspedes said.

Washington, D.C. residents may soon be registered to vote automatically through the Department of Motor Vehicles if a D.C. Council bill passed unanimously Nov. 1 becomes law.
In order for this bill to take effect for the next election cycle, the Automatic Voter Registration Amendment must be signed by Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and undergo a congressional 30-day review period. According to federal law, Congress must review all bills passed by the D.C. Council.
Under the automatic voter registration system, D.C. residents would automatically be registered to vote when they receive a driver’s license or government-issued ID from the DMV. The system is automatic but not mandatory. Residents would have the option to opt out of the voting rolls by filling out a Board of Elections form.
Councilmember and Chair of the D.C. Democratic Party Anita Bonds (D-At Large) said automatic voter registration would likely increase voter participation in the District.
“As an elected official and Chair of the D.C. Democratic Party, I’m pleased that we are able to expand voting opportunities for D.C. residents while also maintaining a more accurate voters list which will produce more accurate and likely higher turnout percentages,” Bonds wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Should the bill become law, D.C. would join five states with automatic voter registration systems — Connecticut, Oregon, California, Vermont and West Virginia. Oregon was the first state to pass automatic voter registration in 2015.
Councilmember Kenyan R. McDuffie (D-Ward 5) said the bill is a major reform of the voting system.
“Voting is the bedrock of our democracy, so it is vital that the government do all it can to make voting as accessible as possible,” McDuffie wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The passing of the Automatic Voter Registration Amendment Act does just that and puts the District of Columbia at the forefront of election reform nationally.”
McDuffie also said automatic voter registration measures would particularly benefit D.C. residents in isolated or temporary living conditions.
“The data tells us that automatic voter registration has the highest impact among traditionally marginalized communities as well as transient communities, like students,” McDuffie said.
The bill was first introduced by Councilmember Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) in May 2015, and is backed by Councilmembers Brianne Nadeau (D-Ward 1), Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3), Elissa Silverman (I-At Large), Bonds and former Councilmember Vincent Orange (D-At Large).
The first reading vote of the bill Oct. 11 also saw unanimous approval from the council.
According to the D.C. Board of Elections, 478,093 residents were registered to vote as of Oct. 31. Roughly 76 percent of voters in the District were registered as Democrats, 6 percent as Republicans and 16 percent as Independent.
Of these registered voters, only 60.4 percent, or 286,403, of District residents actually cast their ballots in the November election.
GU Votes co-founder Bethan Saunders (SFS ’17), whose organization helped over 1,600 Georgetown students vote and accompanied them to the polls on Tuesday’s Election Day, said automatic voter registration is a positive step for voting rights activists.
“As someone who has been deeply involved in voter registration initiatives across the country, the passage of automatic registration in D.C. is a huge win for our movement,” Saunders said. “Automatic registration can dramatically increase registration rates and has been approved in five states, with dozens more following suit.”
Saunders added that automatic voter registration goes beyond increasing registration rates.
“It also has the potential to boost registration rates for previously marginalized voter groups, clean up the rolls, save money, make voting more convenient and reduce the potential for voter fraud,” Saunders said. “I very much hope that this becomes the new norm in America, as voting needs to be an automatic and accessible right for all Americans.”

In celebration of Veterans Day, about 50 students, faculty and veterans attended a ceremony on White-Gravenor Lawn yesterday.
The ceremony aimed to bridge the gap between the general university community and Georgetown students in the military.
In a speech at the ceremony, student veterans advocacy group Georgetown University Student Veterans Association President Christine Starke (SFS ’18) said veterans and Georgetown students have more in common than many believe.
“Our experiences, passions and future careers span as wide as the rest of the Georgetown student body,” Starke said. “We hold a diverse set of opinions, political stances and perspectives on our own service and how it should or should not be recognized.”
The ceremony, which was hosted by the Georgetown University Student Veterans Association, is part of November’s Military Awareness Month. A series of university offices and student groups, including the Office of the President, Campus Ministry and the LGBTQ Resource Center, are hosting events on issues ranging from issues facing students in international militaries to transgender rights in the military.
Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Daniel Feehan (SFS ’05), the ceremony’s keynote speaker, said veterans at Georgetown must work to help create unity, especially in light of President-elect Donald Trump’s victory over former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Tuesday.
“I am here to ask you today to continue engaging in that same work to defuse divisiveness that currently exists in 2016. And not just you student veterans, but all of us,” Feehan said. “Political and cultural divisions that we experience aren’t the only challenges that we face on Veterans Day. We also face the need to bring together those in the military and those outside of it.”
A central issue that veterans face is a misunderstanding and lack of communication with others, according to Feehan. Feehan challenged the audience to bridge this divide by engaging in discussions with veterans to tap into those personal experiences.
“Don’t let our troops and veterans feel like they are kept at arm’s length,” Feehan said. “Most veterans don’t want special treatment. They just want to be understood, and that means get to know our military as individuals, not just as the idea of troops of veterans.”
President John J. DeGioia’s Chief of Staff Joseph Ferrara said veterans and other students joining together makes the entire community stronger.
“We are driven by the knowledge that we are stronger and that we are at our best when we work together,” Ferrara said. “As a university we are committed to working together to create the best possible context where veterans can share their talents, develop their skills and leadership and uphold the values that characterize the military.”
Following the speeches, the color guard hoisted an American flag dedicated to Georgetown veterans.
Ferrara said veterans represent the best of Georgetown.
“By celebrating you this afternoon, we celebrate the very best of our community, the core values that animate our tradition at Georgetown,” Ferrara said.
Maire Stierer (COL ’20), who attended the ceremony, said the ceremony was important to raise awareness for veterans issues.
“Using Veterans Day to open a dialogue about veterans in our community and our greater community of D.C. is huge,” Stierer said.
A ceremony in Riggs Library also celebrated the 241st birthday of the Marine Corps. The oldest and youngest Marines present participated in a traditional cake-cutting ceremony with a Mameluke sword.
Beyond organizing the ceremony and reception, student veteran groups and faculty on campus have made efforts to increase an awareness of veterans on campus in recent years. GUSVA Vice President Vivian Cochran (SFS ’18) said it is important to educate the student body on the veteran culture at Georgetown.
“GUSVA works very closely with faculty to better educate them on how to work with student veterans, but we also hold a lot of social events, and a lot of professional networking events for creating a dialogue and letting them know that we are normal human beings, just trying to get an education like everyone else,” Cochran said.
These efforts have not been without visible result, according to GUSVA Faculty Advisor Barbara Mujica, who said the response to Georgetown veterans has become more positive since she came to the university in 2009.
“Over the years what we’ve seen is that there’s been an awareness of all kinds of topics like women in the military, women in leadership positions, the relationship between military and civilians. These things have developed, and I think the talk today about unity and working together show that the discussion has really matured,” Mujica said.

The government must introduce stricter gun-control laws in light of the June 12 Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting, according to a panel on LGBTQ issues Nov. 9 in the Healey Family Student Center.
In June, 50 people were killed at Pulse, a gay nightclub.
Lisbeth Melendez Rivera, the director of Latino and Catholic initiatives at the Human Rights Campaign, said President-elect Donald Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton is concerning for the LGBTQ movement.
“I don’t know about many of you, but it hasn’t been an easy day and I want to acknowledge that off the bat because I know we’re about to have a difficult discussion that was hard yesterday and is terrifying today. At least that’s how I feel,” Rivera said.
Rivera said the Orlando shooting rocked the LGBTQ community and left many fearful of their and their friends’ safety.
“[When] a madman opened fire into an exiting crowd, it was a dwindling crowd at Pulse. It stopped those of us who have always seen the gay club, the lesbian club as a place of refuge,” Rivera said.
The Orlando shooting was the largest mass shooting in the country in the last 50 years. According to Rivera, the shooting inflicted deep wounds on the LGBTQ community.
“For me until today it’s a moment in which if I give it too much thought I still hear these echoes, right?” Rivera said. “I still hear the echoes of the horror, the images, but I also hear the lament of unanswered questions, the potential that was lost, the questions that will never be answered.”
Audrey Juarez, the legal project coordinator for the Center for American Progress, said the Orlando shooting proved that although progress has been made, the LGBTQ community still faces significant challenges.
“I have not been able to stop thinking about all of this because it’s a new reality, I think it’s a reality that has always existed,” Juarez said. “It has existed for all of the groups of people who have been victims and survivors of this sort of violence, but I think it was a particularly rude awakening for our community.”
According to Rivera, the Orlando shooting reveals how current laws fail to protect the LGBTQ community.
“It was a recognition, and I know what I’m about to say is a little bit controversial, that laws might not always protect us and as a matter of fact hardly they ever do, but they serve as recourse once we’ve been affected,” Rivera said.
Jason Lindsay, executive director of the Pride Fund to End Gun Violence, an LGBTQ group advocating for gun control, said the public should not be able to buy military-grade firearms.
Lindsay served in the Army Reserve for 14 years and was deployed to Iraq.
“I am 100 percent convinced that the lethality and caliber of the weapons that I carried on the streets of Baghdad don’t belong on the streets of America,” Lindsay said.
Lindsay said he is confident that Pride Fund is able to successfully influence gun-control reform.
“We can and we will create change in the gun violence prevention arena,” Lindsay said. “We have the political infrastructure, we have the know-how, we have the finances that we can take on the gun lobby and we can win.”
However, Lindsay addressed the group’s significant opposition from Congress and gun-rights advocates, especially the National Rifle Association.
“The NRA and the gun lobby spent more this election cycle trying to defeat candidates who support gun reform than in their entire history,” Lindsay said.
Rivera said people should not focus on the possible religious motivations of the shooter but rather on the damage done to a community that is often marginalized and targeted.
“This is not because of religion,” Rivera said. “What most people start to talk about when they talk about this is what was the faith or practice of the person who perpetrated the crime. That might have or might have not had something to do with that, we’ll never know, he’s not here to answer that question.”
Rivera said the nation must focus a greater amount of attention on educating people in compassion.
“It’s incredibly important that we talk about how do we go about educating people,” Rivera said. “We need to think about how to move forward in a compassionate, intersectional way.”
Rosio Mondragon Reyes (SFS ’18), who attended the panel, said events like the panel are important in bringing the LGBTQ community together.
“The members on the panel were really good at accommodating for the topic, fixing that around what has happened in the last 24 hours and being flexible with that and being welcoming for the feelings that are present,” Mondragon Reyes said.
Steve Reyes (MSB ’17), also an attendee, said the panel was particularly important in light of Trump’s victory over Clinton.
“It was a great way for the community to come together especially after the results of this election,” Reyes said. “I thought it was good to just reflect and know that there are people there who support you and everyone is kind of together and coping with this result.”
