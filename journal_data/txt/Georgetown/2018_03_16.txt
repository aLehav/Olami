Students of Georgetown, Inc., closed its on-campus shops and storefronts for 17 minutes in support of the National Walkout to End Gun Violence on Wednesday morning.
The walkout commemorated the 17 people killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Feb. 14, when a former student opened fire on students and teachers. Exactly one month after the shooting, students and organizers staged walkouts nationwide, including at Georgetown, where student organizers held a walkout in Healy Circle.
Georgetown’s protest advocating for school safety and gun violence prevention was one of 3,136 student-organized marches across the country, according to EMPOWER, the group behind the national school walkout and the organizing group of the national Women’s March activist group.
The Corp’s participation in the walkout demonstrates of its history of activism. As the self-acclaimed largest student-run non-profit in the world, the student group’s history began with advocacy efforts following the injury of multiple students in the May Day Protests against the Vietnam War in 1971.
Roger Cochetti (SFS ’72) and Nancy Kent (CAS ’72), who were student body president and vice president, respectively, created The Corp to provide a legal entity for these protesting students to file lawsuits against the school. The Corp sold food and drinks in Red Square to raise funds to support this legal enterprise. However, as time passed the Corp focused more on providing student services rather than legal support.
Corp CEO Alex Gong (SFS ’20) said the decision to participate in the walkout emerged from social media discourse and requests of participation from Georgetown students. Gong said The Corp’s history of student advocacy and student service has been lost in recent years, but the new leadership is working to return the nonprofit to its original purpose.
“We wanted to return to our roots a little bit and reclaim the advocacy sphere that we were founded in,” Gong said in an interview with The Hoya. “We heard about [the walkout] online through social media, and we thought it would be a really great opportunity to get back to in the spirit in which we started.”
The decision to close its stores for 17 minutes came out of a desire to stand in solidarity with the Georgetown community and support other student groups, according to Gong.
“We thought it would be really cool to stand with other students at Georgetown who had reached out to us and asked us if we wanted to be involved,” Gong said. “We thought that would be a nice, appropriate and symbolic way to show our support for students.”
Ari Goldstein (COL ’18), historian of the Georgetown University Student Association and member of The Corp, was excited by the group’s participation in the walkout.
“The Corp’s involvement today in the walkout for gun violence was awesome. It was a testament to The Corp’s willingness to get involved,” Goldstein said in an interview with The Hoya.
Gong said The Corp’s community-centered ethos is at the core of student group’s activities.
“I’d like to emphasize that, to me, the true spirit of The Corp is giving back and empowering students, not only through professional opportunities by being employed in The Corp, but I think a lot of people don’t know that every year we give out $85,000 in grants and scholarships right back into the Georgetown community,” Gong said.
Goldstein echoed Gong’s views adding that The Corp’s image on campus does not encompass all its social impact efforts.
“The Corp, more so than almost any organization on campus, has a reputation that eschews its actual mission and founding story is extremely rooted in social action,” Goldstein said. “That gets lost in part because of reputational issues, but I also think it’s lost in part because of the cultural issues.”
The Corp plans to celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2021 and tradition in the Georgetown community.
Gong said The Corp’s participation in this walkout is just the beginning of the nonprofit’s efforts to return to its student advocacy and student service roots.
“The Corp is trying to change and is changing,” Gong said. “We’ve started a lot of initiatives internally and externally to improve our inclusivity and our culture and find ways to make us more positive contributors to campus.”

Significant changes to the School of Foreign Service core curriculum are set to go into effect for students entering in fall 2018, including a new mandatory science course and a reduction in the number of required economics courses.
Daniel Byman, senior associate dean for undergraduate affairs, detailed the modifications in the school’s core requirements in a schoolwide email sent Feb. 28. These changes include the implementation of a mandatory natural science course, a reduction in the number of required major courses to 8 to 10 from 10 to 12, a reduction of the economics requirement to three courses from four and a reduction in the number of three or more-credit courses needed to graduate to 38 from 40. The overall credit requirement will still remain at 121 credits.
These changes will not affect current undergraduate students in the SFS and transfer students entering during the 2018-2019 academic year.
With the reduced number of required economics classes, SFS students will still have to take “Principles of Macroeconomics” and “Principles of Microeconomics.” “International Finance” and “International Trade”, previously taught as separate courses, will be combined into one class for SFS students. However, students majoring in international economics or global business will be required to take the courses separately for these classes to fulfill their major requirements.
The changes to the curriculum mark the first time in the school’s nearly 100-year history that SFS students will be required to take a science course. Previously, only SFS students pursuing the science, technology and international affairs major had a science requirement.
Mark Giordano, the program director for the STIA major in the SFS, said this change has been long overdue.
“Science really is a critical part of international relations and life in general. Making sure our students have the exposure and background to know how to approach science issues after they graduate is our responsibility,” Giordano said. “From a purely practical point of view, you can’t go to an employer and brag that you never took science in college.”
SFS students will be allowed to take any undergraduate science course on campus to fulfill the requirement, according to the dean’s office. SFS also plans to offer new courses with policy related themes, which will be organized around pressing topics rather than traditional academic disciplines. Possible courses include “The Science of Global Infectious Diseases,” “The Science of Weapons of Mass Destruction” and “The Science of Climate Change.”
Byman said these science course offerings will be distinct from current policy classes within the SFS.
“To be literate on a serious policy issue, you have to know the science behind it. The policy is the way of focusing the class’ attention, but we are really trying to make sure this is a science class and not a policy class,” Byman said in an interview with The Hoya.
Unlike the College’s science and math requirement, the SFS’s requirement cannot be fulfilled by Advanced Placement credit from high school or by Georgetown courses such as statistics or computer science, according to Byman.
Before these changes, the SFS core curriculum consisted of one freshman proseminar, two humanities or writing courses, two theology courses, two engaging diversity courses, two government courses, three history courses, four economic courses, two philosophy courses, a language proficiency requirement and the one-credit course “Map of the Modern World.”
Though the new science core course will add an additional requirement for SFS students to fulfill, the net number of courses will drop as a result of the changes in economics and major requirements.
Roopa Mulpuri (SFS ’18), SFS Academic Council President, said the best part of the new core curriculum is the increased flexibility for students to take more courses they are passionate about.
“The decrease to the number of courses for majors across the board I see, in particular, as an advantage,” Mulpuri said. “It gives students more opportunity to try out different concentrations in some fields and majors before making a decision.”

The Georgetown University Law Center Civil Rights Clinic is suing right-wing commentator and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for defamation on behalf of a man who posted footage online of white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017.
Brennan Gilmore, the plaintiff, was among the counterprotesters at the white nationalist rally Aug. 12. Gilmore used his phone to record as Alex Fields Jr. allegedly drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing Heather Heyer and injuring 36 others. Gilmore’s footage was picked up by news media outlets after he posted it on Twitter. He was also interviewed as a witness on several outlets.
The footage also caught the eye of Jones — of Infowars and other far-right outlets — who accused Gilmore of being party to a “deep state” conspiracy to sabotage the presidency of President Donald Trump.
Now, Gilmore alleges the claims Jones made about him caused “irreversible personal and professional damage in Virginia, including the loss of business opportunities in Virginia, irreparable damage to his career as a Foreign Service Officer, and the loss of friendships with individuals in Virginia,” according to the suit.
Gilmore further alleged in a Washington Post op-ed that he and his family were “subject to harassments, threats, hate mail and hacking attempts” after the conspiracy theories spread online. He was also mailed an envelope containing a “suspicious white powder residue” and a “four-page diatribe.”
In an interview with The Hoya, Gilmore said he initially decided to post the video online because his footage showed the incident was a deliberate attack. Soon thereafter, he was unwillingly thrust into the online world of right-wing conspiracy websites.
“I became almost immediately the target of numerous conspiracy theories that really gave me a sort of firsthand perspective on what is now seen as a pattern of attacks that politically motivated outlets like Infowars, the Gateway Pundit, and other defendants launch against the witnesses and other victims of tragedies,” Gilmore said.
The Civil Rights Clinic at the Law Center acts as a public defense firm and is supporting Gilmore’s case pro bono.
“Our hope is that we can create more explicit case law and legal precedent that will refine and set the boundaries for what someone like Alex Jones can and cannot say about a private citizen who happens to be a witness to a terrorist attack,” Andrew Mendrala, a supervising attorney with the Civil Rights Clinic, said in an interview with The Hoya.
Other defendants in the case include the parent company of Infowars, Free Speech Systems, LLC; former congressman Allen West; Lee Stranahan, formerly of Breitbart News and currently of RT; Jim Hoft of Gateway Pundit and Infowars reporter Lee Ann McAdoo.
Gilmore sees the case as a way to take a stand against websites that purvey “fake news.”
“Fact-based journalism is essential to a healthy democracy because it provides citizens with objective information on issues of public concern. Infowars and Gateway Pundit do the opposite — poisoning our civic discourse by distorting the truth and blurring the line between news and propaganda,” Gilman wrote in the Washington Post op-ed.
The lawsuit was filed Tuesday; Jones has since posted a video asserting the legal action is itself a deep state conspiracy by Georgetown and the CIA. Gilmore also said online harassment of him has “ramped up considerably.”
“I’ve been getting messages calling me all sorts of profanities,” Gilmore said in an interview with The Hoya.
The Georgetown lawsuit is not the first time Jones has been sued for defamation. In April 2017, the yogurt company Chobani sued Jones for alleging the company’s Idaho factory, which employs refugees, was linked to a 2016 child sexual assault case and a rise in tuberculosis, according to The New York Times. He later settled the suit and made a statement in one of his broadcasts, apologizing for mischaracterizing the company.
Mendrala said settling cases makes sense for many plaintiffs, but would not allow for the kind of impact the clinic is hoping for with this case.
“If he settles an individual case, then that individual case goes away and those people are pacified,” Mendrala said. “But it doesn’t have a larger effect on the future.”
Mendrala also cautioned the case is not meant to undermine First Amendment speech laws.
“We feel like a victory in this case would be a victory for people like Brennan nationwide,” Mendrala said. “And it would shift the paradigm onto which conspiracy theorists operate by holding them legally accountable for their lies.”

Businesses should help the government solve social and environmental issues, said Deval Patrick, former governor of Massachusetts and current managing director of investing firm Bain Capital Double Impact during, a talk in Lohrfink Auditorium on March 14.
Titled “Social Impact Investment and America’s Health: A Fireside Chat with Deval Patrick,” the event was hosted by Georgetown’s School of Nursing and Health Studies and was moderated by Gregory Downing, the executive director for innovation in the immediate office of the Secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services.
Patrick, an active investor in socially conscious projects, said the business community must be involved in helping alleviate social issues, such as social inequities, as the community has been on the sidelines in addressing social issues in the past.
“In many ways we’ve expected government and philanthropy to solve what ails us and tell business, ‘Do what you do’ and, well, clean it up,” Patrick said. “It’s occurring to more of us that the scale of our challenges and the impact of them is so broad, so it’s going to take everyone on the field.”
Originally from the South Side of Chicago, Patrick moved to Massachusetts at age 14 and attended Harvard University for undergraduate and law school. Following his graduation from law school, Patrick launched his career as an attorney and businessman, eventually becoming a senior executive at Texaco and Coca-Cola. Patrick’s career in public service began in 1994 when former President Bill Clinton appointed him to serve as assistant attorney general for civil rights. Patrick later served as a two-term governor of Massachusetts, from 2007 to 2015. He was the state’s first African-American governor.
Today, Patrick works at Bain Capital, where he is involved in social impact investing, which refers to investments made into companies, organizations and funds with the intention to generate a measurable, beneficial social or environmental impact alongside a financial return. Patrick said this is a topic he became interested in while he was governor.
“I got interested in this space through social impact bonds,” Patrick said. “I learned about them in my old job, when the inventor of social impact bonds came to the US and introduced it to various sitting politicians.”
Since arriving at Bain Capital in 2015, Patrick found success with socially conscious projects like Impact Fitness and Springworks Therapeutics, two social impact investment projects. Impact Fitness seeks to implement a series of low-cost gyms in Michigan and Northern Ohio to target gym deserts, areas with few gyms and high incidences of diabetes and heart disease. The initiative included a partnership with local healthcare providers to measure times of week when people experience their lowest heart rates and tailor the gym hours to meet those times, Patrick said.
“The conventional economics of gyms is charge as much as possible and hope nobody comes,” Patrick said. “This is the upside down of that.”
Springworks Therapeutics, another investment project in which Patrick is involved, was founded in 2017 as a therapeutic development company that focuses on bringing faster treatment to patients. Springworks Therapeutics seeks to develop components of drugs at a lower cost than those currently offered by large pharmaceutical companies.
For Patrick, combining the benefits for the recipients of the program with benefits for the community and environment at large is an especially important facet of his work, a goal that he believes is relatively unique in public policy work.
“We are hungry for innovation in public policy,” Patrick said. “Successful innovation requires you raise your tolerance for failure, but politics punishes for failure.”
In addition to measuring the financial success of investments at the time of the project, social impact investing measures the impact of its investments when it comes to solving social or environmental issues to take account for benefits that will be enjoyed in the future, Patrick said.
“[Social impact investing is] an innovation back to the future,” Patrick said. “If you really believe in long-term value, you cannot manage to the financial bottom line alone.”
Despite the benefits that Patrick has noticed from social impact investing, it has not been widely adopted in the United States, though many firms in Europe operate under the social impact investing model.
Patrick believes that this stance is due to the tendency in the United States to separate business work from social justice work, which is a practice he hopes to change.
“Many investors/corporations who believe you make money with one hand and do good with the other, and I’d like to challenge that,” Patrick said.

A second annual UndocuWeek planned for next month aims to raise awareness and garner support for students without documentation, whose futures remain uncertain after unsuccessful congressional efforts to pass a permanent legislative replacement for the rescinded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
This year’s UndocuWeek, scheduled to run from April 16 to 20, is an important step to raise awareness about students without documentation in the Georgetown community and beyond, said Associate Director for Undocumented Student Services Arelis Palacios at an information session held in the Intercultural Center Auditorium on Tuesday.
The week includes a series of educational discussions, movie screenings and community activities designed to actualize the university’s vision of cura personalis, or care for the whole person.
Tuesday’s information session discussed the university’s continuing advocacy efforts and the status of current DACA litigation in response to community concern over the vulnerability of DACA recipients.
Last September, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the rescission of DACA, an executive program put into effect during the administration of former President Barack Obama that temporarily protected about 690,000 immigrants without documentation who were brought to the United States as children from deportation.
Federal district courts in California and New York have since issued nationwide injunctions blocking the Trump administration from ending the program. While the administration appeals the injunctions, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services must continue renewing permits for current DACA recipients but does not have to accept new applications.
Efforts to pass permanent protections for immigrants without documentation have stalled in Congress.
Palacios, who has helped plan UndocuWeek, said her longtime advocacy for immigrants without documentation stems from her hope to reshape the negative societal perceptions around student DACA recipients.
“What I want to do is carve out some of the negativity and toxic rhetoric away from them so they can continue to persist here uninterrupted,” Palacios said.
At Tuesday’s information session, Palacios spoke alongside Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, Vice President and General Counsel Lisa Brown, Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming and Mizraim Belman Guerrero (SFS ’20), a member of UndocuHoyas, a group that advocates for students without documentation.
Palacios said UndocuWeek will not just focus on data alone, which she feels can lead to an incomplete conception about the true significance about the debate on DACA.
“When I think about what it means to teach this to others, understand that it’s about facts and data,” Palacios said, “but it’s also about family, humanity and giving you the tools to understand this data in a very nuanced way.”
Belman Guerrero echoed Palacios’s sentiment and stressed the importance of recognizing the humanity of students without documentation.
“It’s important to humanize the issue and the people being affected, because at the end of the day, we’re humans, we’re students and we’re really here to try to make the best life that we can,” Belman Guerrero said.
Tuesday’s information session and the second annual UndocuWeek mark the latest efforts in a broad campaign by Georgetown administrators and students to advocate for DACA recipients.
Last September, Georgetown students wrote letters to call upon members of Congress to support the Dream Act of 2017 through the Friends of the Dreamers campaign hosted by the Office of Federal Relations and the Georgetown University Student Association.
Also in September, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) (SFS ’66, LAW ’69) — the lead sponsor of the original DREAM Act since 2001 — invited a number of Georgetown DACA recipients to Capitol Hill and delivered a speech to his Senate colleagues championing the Dream Act of 2017.
In December, Georgetown filed amicus briefs in defense of DACA beneficiaries for the cases in California and New York. Seventeen other Jesuit colleges and universities have also filed amicus briefs to demonstrate the interest institutions of higher education have in the case.
“We’re basically saying how important DACA students are to our campuses and what the impact of the revocation of DACA will be, not only on DACA recipients but also on the university and on the nation overall. We’re going to file in the 9th Circuit case as well,” Brown said.
Since September, University President John J. DeGioia has repeatedly lobbied members of Congress to pass the Dream Act of 2017, including in personal letters to alumni lawmakers and in an October op-ed in The Hill with three other university presidents.
Meanwhile, Georgetown’s Undocumented Student Services team has been working to formalize and expand its services for community members without documentation.
The university has also made recent headway in extending its support system for students without documentation to the graduate level.
“The reality of deportation is an overlay that quite literally hangs over the student on top of their financial, academic and familial stresses,” Palacios said. “For graduate students, who are in an even more precarious predicament, I’m very pleased that we have been able to raise enough funds to cover all their immigration fees at this point.”
Fleming said the university will continue its support for everyone the DACA rescission has affected leading up to the Supreme Court’s review of the issue next fall.
“We have to think about how we can keep this issue alive,” Fleming said. “We have many ideas for advocacy between now and then, and we’re in it for the long haul.”
