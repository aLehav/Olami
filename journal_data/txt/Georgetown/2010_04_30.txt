On the first day of classes for the fall 2009 semester, students in the McDonough School of Business no longer departed for five separate classroom buildings on campus and instead convened in the new Rafik B. Hariri building. As we approach the end of the inaugural academic year of the new home of the MSB, students and administrators expressed satisfaction with the new building, but maintain that there is still room for growth for the program.
“Coming together under one roof provides us with the unified space we need to build on our community of achievement that focuses on developing leaders with a global mindset,” Chris Kormis, the MSB’s associate dean for marketing and communications, said in an e-mail.
Kormis said that the new building offers abundant new spaces including 15 classrooms, 34 breakout rooms and a 400-seat auditorium.
The expansion of the business school’s facilities has allowed for significant improvements to existing programs such as the distinguished leader series, according to Ronak Parikh (MSB ’12). Speakers this year have included Richard Branson, Ted Leonsis and former president of India Abdul Kalam.
The new facilities have also improved the academic experience for students, said Lowell Karr (MSB ’11), president of the MSB Academic Council. Karr cited the building’s technology as being helpful in creating a better working environment.
“The building is essentially state of the art in terms of quality and technical aspects. Every breakout room has a large TV that can be connected to a laptop, helping groups better work on their projects and produce better work,” Karr said.
The new building helped to boost the MSB’s undergraduate program ranking to 23rd in the nation this year, one spot up from 2009.While administrators are pleased with the climb in the rankings, students said that the limitations of the curriculum could be a cause for the MSB not being ranked higher.
“Georgetown focuses heavily on finance and to an extent accounting, and not much on majors like marketing, management, international business or operations management,” Parikh said. “We have an exceptional faculty, but the diversity of course selection does not match that of [schools like] NYU.”
While students expressed some dissatisfaction with the curriculum, the main area needing improvement for the MSB seems to lie in assisting students in planning for the future. According to the Career Center’s senior survey from the Class of 2009, 76 percent of MSB graduates found employment after graduation. Eleven percent are still seeking employment. Nine percent went to graduate or professional school.
Parikh said that the MSB had not provided him with guidance about pursuing a master’s degree. Norean Sharpe, an associate dean in the MSB, said that the MSB trains students for professional development, citing the Alumni Mentor Program, which allows for alumni to give career advice to juniors and seniors doing summer internships in D.C. and New York City, and the Professional Development Series, a series of pre-professional panels.
“Judging from the number of internships our juniors obtain, I believe that Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business provides an excellent academic foundation and an extensive alumni network for our students,” Sharpe said.
Students are not entirely convinced of the effectiveness of these initiatives, however, which are mainly geared towards juniors and seniors.
“From what I’ve heard, [the MSB] doesn’t give you direct support with the job search,” Parikh said. “I feel that the MSB should also assist in this aspect of business students’ lives. Much of the success students have with internships is on their own merit or through family or alumni connections.”
Karr said that the MSB is effective in helping people find internships, but indicated that this is largely the result of guidance from faculty.
“The MSB is very good at preparing students to find business jobs and internships. Faculty are an amazing resource for students to help them with contacts, references and advice on how to help get such a job,” Karr said.

From advocating for wage increases for the Department of Public Safety officers to protesting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, this year has been marked by a surge of student activism on campus, with many choosing to hold public rallies or demonstrations to draw attention to their causes.
According to James Reardon-Anderson, senior associate dean and director of undergraduate programs in the School of Foreign Service, peaceful protest and the ensuing dialogue is a large part of being a student at a university.
“When students care enough to get active about something, generally speaking, it’s a good sign. Sometimes it gets a little bit excessive, but that is just the way people are. This is a democracy and you have to allow for a certain amount of give and take,” Reardon-Anderson said.
One particularly highly public demonstration was the protest organized by Plan A: Students for Reproductive Justice during one of the Georgetown Admissions Ambassador Program Open House Weekend in March. Supporters chained themselves to the statue of John Carroll in Healy Circle, shouted chants and passed out fliers to current members of the Georgetown community as well as many prospective students. While some prospective families said they did not support the protest, many said they viewed it as a sign that Georgetown students are active on campus.
“It gives a perspective to a potential student as to how their voices will be heard, given that there is an opportunity to protest. It feels good that groups are comfortable expressing themselves to the administration,” prospective parent Lesli Adams of Anaheim, Calif., said to THE HOYA on March 27.
Bryan Woll (COL ’12), president of Georgetown University College Democrats, agreed. He said that the expression of a diversity of opinions is integral to a democratic society and an academic community.
“There seems to be the general aversion to all things [similar to] public disturbance, things not common place, people making their voices heard in a loud way. The fact that people are uncomfortable about that is something we should get beyond,” Woll said.
The student activism may indicate that Georgetown students, in particular, have a heightened awareness of issues within the community.
“Georgetown students have a very strong sense of social responsibility. That’s part of what we work to imbed in our students. That is something we find to be a very attractive quality,” Scott Fleming, associate vice president for federal relations, said.
But there are many who believe that there is a careful line between productive discussion and disrespect. According to Reardon-Anderson, protest goes too far if there is ever violence or the threat of violence. Others believe that activism takes an adverse form when it infringes on others’ right to free speech.
“Students are not only allowed to express their views but also encouraged to do so,” Will Downes (COL ’11) said. “As a general rule, you have the right of freedom of expression and protest, but not at the expense of others’ right to free speech.”
Those who protested at Gen. David Petraeus’ address in Gaston Hall on Jan. 21 were criticized along these lines by many members of the Georgetown community.
A groups of students, led by Jon Askonas (SFS ’13), organized to form Students for Respectful Dialogue and co-hosted a counterprotest in reaction to the anti-war protests.
“Our issue wasn’t with their message. Our message to them was, You are hurting yourself if you are attacking someone else’s free speech to promote your own,” Askonas said. “It makes yourself look bad.”
Chessa Gross (SFS ’10), a participant in the counterprotest, ultimately deemed the demonstration
successful because they were able to effectively convey their message.
“I think the issue with the negative reaction to the Petraeus protests was the assumption that this speech was intended to be dialogue. Petraeus’ `strategic engagement’ speech to promote the U.S. occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan was not planned as a dialogue,” Gross said. “This was planned as a propaganda event with canned responses to audience questions – by no means is that a `dialogue.'”
any of the protests this year, including the call for a wage raise for DPS officers to improve student safety and Georgetown Divest!, a coalition seeking to persuade the university to divest from companies that violate human rights in Israel and Palestine, demanded response and action from the university administration.
“The university supports the right of everyone in our community to make their views known in a dignified manner,” Director of Media Relations Andy Pino said. “To that end, we offer numerous avenues where our students and members of our faculty and staff can provide insight and input on decisions that affect nearly every aspect of university life.”
In that sense, many of the campaigns have been successful. Plan A was granted a meeting with administrators and continues to engage in productive discussion with the university. And while a compromise has not been reached, LaMarr Billups, assistant vice president for business policy planning, has responded to the concerns of the Divest! coalition.
“To a certain degree, a campus has to tolerate some space there,” Reardon-Anderson said. “[A university] can certainly impose its rules and so forth, but it doesn’t want to be too draconian,” he said.
The push for a DPS wage raise also had real, tangible results. According to Gross, a member of Georgetown Solidarity Committee, new officers were being paid about $15 per hour – lower than any other university safety officer in the District, who largely receive about $18 or $19 per hour. When their contract came up for negotiation, the university offered them a raise of 40 cents.
“They came to us because they were in a bind,” Gross said. “They were under a university gag order against publicly advocating for themselves. In the end, it was students and officers fighting together that made a wage raise possible.”
After writing to the administration, hosting a rally on campus, and engaging in a silent protest during negotiations, the supporters were able to publicize their opinions. In the end, the officers were ultimately granted a raise of $2.50.
While the lasting impact of these campaigns and the future of this trend of student activism is uncertain, the demonstrations have captured the attention of the Georgetown community, fulfilling the ultimate goal of the student participants.
“I am actually attracted to protest,” Reardon-Anderson said, “just to see what students think about and are concerned about.”

As Midnight Madness drew to a close on October 16, rumors swirled around McDonough Gymnasium that a shot had been fired inside the building. Anne Kenslea (COL ’13) didn’t hear a gunshot, but she recalled being on the verge of panic.
“We were all worried that something had actually happened, and part of it was we didn’t think that it could have actually been that serious, because it didn’t seem that real,” she said.
Around 10:20 p.m. that night, then-freshman William Thiele, who goes by Alex, fired a handgun at a toilet in one of the men’s restrooms near the gymnasium’s lobby. He then went to his residence hall, Village C West, according to police reports. Thiele reportedly found the firearm inside the purse of off-duty U.S. Park Police officer Sherice Clanton, who left the accessory on the bleachers.
While Metropolitan Police Department and Georgetown’s Department of Public Safety responded to the incident, attendees remained in the arena, barred from leaving the premises. Their cheers for the men’s and women’s basketball squads continued for several minutes until patience seemed to run short. Dylan Hunt (COL ’13) said many in the crowd swarmed in the lobby of the arena, eager to leave at the festivities’ scheduled end time.
“It was frustrating since no one knew what was going on, so everyone was getting annoyed with being cramped into that pretty small space,” Hunt said.
According to Kenslea, who was in the middle of the gym while the arena’s exits were blocked off, men’s basketball Head Coach John Thompson III started an “impromptu dance party,” ostensibly to stay panic and disorder. But she said it didn’t take long before uneasiness began to set in.
Within about 40 minutes of the gunshot, Thiele – located by MPD and DPS in his residence hall – was in police custody. Those who attended to celebrate the kickoff of official basketball practices were permitted to leave the building at around 11:05 p.m.
A little over four hours after the initial alert of the incident, Rocco DelMonaco Jr. and Todd Olson, vice presidents for university safety and student affairs, respectively, sent an advisory e-mail to the university community. Informing students, faculty and staff that MPD had arrested a suspect, DelMonaco and Olson said the situation was under control.
“Police tell us this appears to be an isolated incident and there is no continuing threat to the university community,” the e-mail stated. “As you know, we take the safety and security of our campus community very seriously and we appreciate the quick and effective work of DPS and MPD officers to resolve this matter expeditiously.”
As MPD conducted a follow-up investigation, the crisis colored ongoing Senior Parents’ Weekend programming; DelMonaco addressed family members of the Class of 2010 about university safety protocol Saturday, according to university spokesperson Julie Bataille.
Looking back, Hunt said he wishes he had been notified sooner of the university response.
Kenslea agreed, citing students’ uncertainty as they made their way out of McDonough late that Friday evening.
“We had all been hearing rumors for those four hours [before the announcement was made]. Everyone’s still talking, and I feel like at that point, the word had gotten out across campus but nobody knew the full story,” she said.
Kenslea added that utilizing the HOYAlert emergency notification service could have helped ease student tension.
Andy Pino, director of media relations, said HOYAlert wasn’t employed due to the effectiveness of the coordinated MPD and DPS response.
“University law enforcement officers were prepared to use the HOYAlert system during this incident, but determined that law enforcement considerations, including the situation’s swift resolution, made it unnecessary,” Pino said.
Following Thiele’s October arrest, he pleaded guilty to carrying a handgun without a license, in a case that led to a sentence of 18 months probation, to be served in his home state of California. He plans to re-enroll in college in the fall. Clanton, whose purse contained the handgun acquired by Thiele, remains a U.S. Park Police officer, according to Sgt. David Schlosser, U.S. Park Police spokesperson.
If anything, Kenslea said, the gunshot fired at October’s Midnight Madness was the final act in a series of unfortunate events.
“I feel like the combination of kids who were all riled up for Midnight Madness, some of whom were probably drunk, and an unattended gun – it’s obviously not an ideal situation.”

The Executive Curriculum Committee for the College passed plans for a business minor Tuesday night, finalizing a year-long process begun when the College Academic Council proposed giving students in the College the option to study business.
According to College Dean Chester Gillis, lengthy negotiations between the College and the McDonough School of Business have taken place to make sure the business minor will be successful.
“It’s taken a whole year to hammer out the arrangements,” he said.
The business minor will be available by application to students in the College starting with the Class of 2012.
College Academic Councilmember David Dietz (COL ’10) detailed the work of the council in creating the new academic option.
“In the last few years it became clear that students in the College wanted a `practical’ minor to pair with their liberal arts majors. This past fall, in response to the growing desire for such a minor, we on the academic council drafted a proposal to allow students in the College to minor in the business school,” he said.
The business minor was previously available to students in the Faculty of Languages and Linguistics, but now the business minor is open to all students in the College.
According to Associate Dean Hubert Cloke, this minor is more than just about “pre-professional credentialing.”
Cloke said that the goal was to integrate liberal arts coursework with business coursework. “We think we have achieved that through the option to include one College elective in the minor and through a common capstone course taken by all students in the MSB along with all College business minors,” he said.
Gillis agreed with Dean Cloke on this front.
“The business minor is not really making the College pre-professional but extending opportunities across schools,” he said.
According to Cloke, the pre-requisites for the minor would include a year of math (one semester of calculus and one of probability and statistics), as well as a year of economics.
“This is to ensure that students have the preparation the MSB faculty thinks necessary for success in their elective courses,” Cloke said. Gillis emphasized that the minor will be just like any other minor in the College, but will have a selection of courses principally in the MSB that emphasize business life.
According to Norean Sharpe, undergraduate dean of the MSB, “both the business and College faculty are delighted to finally see the business minor become a reality.”
The cross-college discussions were facilitated by Deans Cloke and Sharpe, and the major structure and details were decided by the two curriculum committees within the College and MSB.
Sharpe cited professor Pietra Rivoli, who teaches finance and international business inthe MSB, as “being instrumental in helping to move the ball forward on this project,” since she served as chair of the school’s curriculum committee. According to Sharpe, “This new business minor will be a unique opportunity for College students to complement their major within the College and to add to their education by taking courses in finance, accounting, management, operations, strategy, marketing, international business and entrepreneurship.”
Cloke said that the minor will be capped at 50 juniors and 50 seniors in the College, beginning with the Class of 2012.
“The details of the application process will be sent to all rising juniors in the College in the next week or so, and I expect that we will select 50 students early this summer who will begin the minor in the fall,” Cloke said.
Student reactions have been largely in favor for the business minor.
“I think that it creates a wide range of opportunities for those with majors in the College and has practical implications to pair with maybe a less practical major,” Laura Golojuch (COL ’13) said.
Ben Burdick (COL ’13) agreed. “I think it’s a good idea because it gives students in the College who don’t want to major and concentrate on business a solid experience within the business realm of education,” he said.

The administration dealt a blow to Georgetown, Divest!, a coalition of students on campus that wants the university to divest from companies that may profit from human rights abuses in Israel and Palestine, on Tuesday.
Assistant Vice President for Business Policy and Planning LaMarr Billups wrote a letter to Georgetown, Divest! stating that the administration would not modify its investment practices.
Referencing the coalition’s April 9 meeting with a senior team of administrators, Billups wrote, “At that meeting you asked if Georgetown University would divest from managed funds that own stocks in certain companies that do business with Israel. The answer to that question is no.”
The question of divestment is a difficult one, since the university does not invest directly in companies, but rather in managed funds. The Investment Office does not make its investments public.
“Georgetown’s investment practices do not include the selection of individual securities,” Director of Media Relations Andy Pino said. “As a result, the question of divestment does not apply.”
Still, Georgetown, Divest! member and Vice President of Students for Justice in Palestine Jackson Perry (COL ’12) said he knows Georgetown, Divest!’s struggles are not for nothing.
“First of all, [Chief Investment Officer Larry Kochard] told us that he believed we were invested in Caterpillar,” Perry said. Caterpillar is one of the companies that Georgetown, Divest! has asked the university to divest from.
Perry added, “Condoms and cohabitation are not permitted on campus because they are not in keeping with the Jesuit values of the institution, yet the administration thinks our Jesuit values shouldn’t play a role in investment decisions at all? This is hypocrisy.”
Other schools around the country are also pushing university administrations to divest.
According to a press release from the chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine at University of California, Berkeley, students have been working to pass a bill through the UC Berkeley Student Senate on divestment since March.
On Wednesday, the UC Berkeley Student Senate met to vote on a bill that would urge the university to divest from two companies that profit from the manufacture of weapons for the Israeli Army. The student senate failed to override the veto on the bill, falling short by just one vote.
Other American universities that have called for divestment include the University of Michigan Dearborn, Hampshire College and the University of Wisconsin.
“Changing the status quo is one of the hardest things for anyone to do,” Perry said. “However, we are optimistic that the right amount of pressure from various directions, including especially the constant reminder of the moral values of our university itself, will break through the bureaucratic inertia and amoral mindset that is currently dominating the way the university has responded.”
**Correction:** This article stated that the GUSA Senate met to vote on a bill that would urge the university to divest from two companies. The UC Berkeley Student Senate met to vote on such a bill.

As the H1N1 pandemic swept the nation last fall, 738 Georgetown students reported symptoms related to this particular strand of flu to the university, according to James Welsh, assistant vice president for student health. Four hundred seventeen students were treated at the Student Health Center or the Georgetown University Hospital, and an additional 321 students called the H1N1 Nurse Advice hotline.
“We treated or knew of [about] 750 students who were ill with influenza-like illness during the H1N1 epidemic,” Welsh said. “It is likely that there were many more ill who did not seek treatment, but this number is impossible to quantify.”
The symptoms experienced with H1N1 are similar to those of the seasonal flu; the H1N1 virus, however, is considered more severe.
Ashley Davoli (COL ’13) experienced typical flu-like symptoms, but was hospitalized for H1N1’s effect on her lungs.
“As it got worse, my fever pretty much stayed around for three or four days, I was coughing and sneezing constantly and felt like I’d been hit by a truck, my whole body hurt,” Davoli said in an e-mail. “It lasted for about nine or 10 days, and my coughing got so bad I had to go to the [emergency room] because I couldn’t breathe.”
Georgetown started preparing for H1N1 months before the pandemic hit campus early this fall. According to Welsh, the university formed an H1N1 task force in the spring of 2009, when H1N1 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The group worked to implement a plan that included education about preventing the spread of H1N1, isolation plans for ill students and increased sanitization of public space.
Davoli said she believes that the school succeeded in increasing awareness about H1N1 and prevented its further spread by encouraging ill students to stay in their dorm rooms, but she said that in her experience the Student Health Center’s response was slow.
“The health center was incredibly slow in dealing with me, and even though they told me to come in immediately, all they did was tell me to go back and sleep and come back in two days, something they could have told me over the phone,” Davoli said. “I ended up going to the ER because the doctor on call at the health center over the weekend said I’d get faster treatment there than if I came to them.”
The university also worked to provide H1N1 vaccines for students, but received shipments late and in small quantities. According to Welsh, Georgetown originally ordered 9,000 doses of the H1N1 vaccine, but only received 800 doses by Nov. 17, which were given to those in the high-risk category. The high-risk group includes health care workers, medical and nursing students, Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Services paramedics and students under the age of 25 who are at a higher risk of infection.
The university then received 800 more doses on Nov. 19, which were given to all students under age 24 on a first-come, first-serve basis.
“I think the biggest frustration for us was access to vaccine – both the H1N1 vaccine and the seasonal flu vaccine were slow in production and distribution, and much of our epidemic had already peaked by the time we received our first dose of vaccine,” Welsh said. “We were successfully able to give out more than 7,000 doses of both, and I do believe that that effort was particularly effective in helping to make this year’s seasonal flu season relatively mild.”
Although H1N1 affected over 738 students, the university never considered closing due to the threat, according to Welsh.
H1N1 affected other area universities at about the same rate. The George Washington University had about 800 cases of H1N1 last semester, as reported by the GW Hatchet.
As of April 18, 2010, the WHO reported more than 17,853 deaths in over 214 countries.

This fall, students with high school experience in introductory economics will have the chance to take a condensed, one-semester course that comprises both micro- and macroeconomics.
The economics department added the three-credit ECON 003: Principles of Economics to its fall course listings to serve as the introductory class for students who have completed prior economics coursework.
According to economics professor Arik Levinson, director of undergraduate studies for the economics department, “The course will move faster through material than Econ 001 or Econ 002. It is aimed at students who have had some high school economics, but not enough to get a 5 on both AP exams.”
The course, which will be taught by professor Behzad Diba, was conceived in response to a spike in the number of students with high school experience in economics.
“The students in Econ 001 and 002 are quite heterogeneous in terms of their background and facility with the topic,” Diba said. “We hope some students will be better served by the new course.”
Diba said the syllabus would cover the material at a quicker pace, with a more individual reading of the textbook and homework exercises on Aplia, an online coursework supplement.
“We follow the standard textbooks and cover the topics at the same level of depth. It just goes faster and relies more on students to take an active role in learning the material,” he said.
Levinson said he expects the class, which is capped at 50 students, to be a popular option.
“We have tried to boost its chances of success by coaxing one of the department’s most engaging and popular teachers – Behzad Diba – to launch the first semester,” he added.
The class would count collectively for the economics major’s Principles of Microecenomics (ECON 001) and Principles of Macroeconomics (ECON 002) classes; economics majors would still need to take another elective to fulfill the major requirements.
“Students who have the background will be able to move more quickly through the courses about the tools of economics (micro/macro/stats/metrics) into courses about those applications of economics in which they are most interested,” Levinson said in an e-mail.
The School of Foreign Service Curriculum Committee has not approved ECON 003 yet as an option for fulfilling the SFS economics requirement, according to Senior Associate SFS Dean James Reardon-Anderson.
“We really have to see how this works because currently we require a full semester of micro and macro and to put it into one [course] would result in a change in the curriculum,” he said.
Reardon-Anderson said that it was not implausible for the SFS curriculum to accept the course as a prerequisite instead of ECON 001 and 002; since the curriculum committee only received the report last week and the course is a new arrival, however, they would re-evaluate the prospects of utilizing the course during the next academic school year.
Regarding the use of ECON 003 for the McDonough School of Business economics requirements, MSB Associate Dean Norean Sharpe said in an e-mail, “We won’t know until this fall, as our curriculum committee won’t meet again until September. This issue will be early on our agenda, so that we will have a decision in time for pre-registration in October and November. All current students must follow the existing requirements of both ECON 001 and 002.”
She added that since MSB students do not take their economics requirements until sophomore year, the MSB curriculum committee would have some time to figure it out for the incoming freshman class.
Anna Highberger (COL ’13), a prospective economics major, said that after her exposure in high school to economics, some of her economics courses reviewed the same concepts.
“I really wish they would’ve had it for me as a freshman,” she said.
According to College Associate Dean Thomas Chiarolanzio, the course was created after recommendations from an external evaluation facilitated by University Provost James O’Donnell.
Chiarolanzio said he was pleased with the addition of the course.
“I think it’s a welcome course and a welcome change,” he said. “It creates more options overall, and I’m glad they investigated it.”

This month the Georgetown Players voted to split into two groups: the Georgetown Improv Association and Georgetown University Children’s Theater.
“We’ve been informally talking about it for a while and perhaps formally decided to split last spring,” Jed Feiman (COL ’12), the new executive producer of the Improv Association, said. “It’s been a year-long process developing separate constitutions, and each group successfully presented its own constitution to [Performing Arts Advisory Council] this month.”
Both groups decided that the split made sense because the two groups had different missions, according to Feiman.
“Initially there may have been overlap between members in the improv troupe and Children’s Theater, which is why it was under one organization. But over time, the groups have developed two fundamentally different memberships and audiences and ultimately were linked in name only,” he said. “Most importantly, the artistic missions of the two groups, performing improvised comedy and developing theater for young audiences, are truly different.”
Elizabeth Seaman (COL ’12), the acting president of Children’s Theater, said that it became difficult logistically for the two groups to function as one.
“Since both groups now have increased membership and are expanding in the performing arts community, we have different needs,” she said. “One of the largest problems we faced was that when we were one group we only had one board, and it was difficult to have our officers divided between the two groups.”
Next year the Improv Association hopes to expand by creating its own Web site and looking to the greater D.C. area for venues, according to Sean Quigley (SFS ’12), the group’s treasurer.
“We’re also planning on improving our relationship with the Washington Improv Theater – hopefully having some of their troupes over here and performing in their space as well,” he said. “And of course we’ll be maintaining our monthly shows in Bulldog Alley, as well as our annual ImprovFest in February.”
Children’s Theater will begin expanding programming through children’s theater workshops and writing workshops, according to Evan Mousseau (COL ’11), newly elected president of the group.
“Right now we have plans to begin expanding our programming, first of all to include acting workshops for local youth, along with the touring show we perform each semester. We’re also hoping to workshop original student-written material for the group to perform,” he said. “We’re really excited about the growth this will bring, not only to our outreach in the community, but also to our membership, since these new efforts will give more opportunities for involvement.”
**Correction:** An earlier version of this article stated one of the two groups resulting from the split will be called the Georgetown University Improv Group. The group will be called Georgetown Improv Association.

Ending his four-year term as a Georgetown University Distinguished Scholar in the Practice of Global Leadership, former President of Poland Aleksander Kwaśniewski delivered a farewell speech in the Fisher Colloquium, focusing on the future of Poland and Central and Eastern Europe.
Kwaśniewski, who served from 1995 to 2005 as the Polish head of state, highlighted the challenges that Central and Eastern Europe will face in the future.
One challenge, he said, will be the changing cultural and religious demographics occurring in Europe. Specifically singling out France and Spain as major centers of multicultural demographics, Kwaśniewski said that the European Union’s response to these changes would prove challenging for the internal structure of Europe.
“If you want to look at the future policy of the United States or the global order in the world, it’s necessary to count on the European Union as one of the most important partners of these questions [that] we have today,” he said.
Kwaśniewski spoke of the April 10 crash in Smolensk, Russia, that killed Polish president Lech Kaczynski and first lady Maria, along with 94 other Polish dignitaries and passengers. But Kwaśniewski remained optimistic about the future.
“If you see what has happened after the crash, this is of course, extremely sad and painful. But you see that Polish democracy works, and the constitution has remained strong,” said the former president, a co-author of the current Polish constitution.
“We never thought that such drama could happen, but afterward, the Polish state, democracy and institutions are in good shape.”
He also was hopeful about the future of Russian-Polish relations.
“Differences will exist, but in a better atmosphere we can create a serious dialogue and better relationships, what is in favor of Russia, Poland and the European Union. I am optimistic that this accident [the plane crash] can open up a new and better relationship.”
During a Q-and-A session following his speech, the former president discussed a range of issues, spanning from the current financial crisis in Greece to his predictions of the upcoming Polish presidential elections’ outcome.
“In my opinion, more experience is necessary. I think the favorite is quite obviously [Bronislaw] Komorowski [current acting president] and will most likely win.” Acting President Komorowski faces an election against the late president’s twin brother, Jaroslaw Kaczynski.
“I hope that you – the students of Georgetown, who are interested in foreign policy – will continue to study the region during and after your time at Georgetown. I encourage you to understand that Central and Eastern Europe is important, not only in the past, but today and tomorrow.”
Prior to his appointment in 2006 as a distinguished leader by University President John J. DeGioia, Kwaśniewski was one of the founding members of the New Social Democratic Party of Poland, and served as the party’s chairman. He won the 1995 presidential election and was re-elected in 2000, making him the only Polish president to serve two terms.
He concluded, “It was an honor, an adventure and a time that I will remember. I am extremely grateful.”
**Correction:** A previous version of this article incorrectly spelled former Polish President Aleksander Kwaśniewski’s surname as Kwaniewski.

Melissa Anelli (COL ’01), webmaster of The Leaky Cauldron, a popular Harry Potter fan site, bewitched students in Lohrfink Auditorium Wednesday evening with her wizard world expertise.
The event, originally scheduled to occur Feb. 10, was postponed until April 28 due to the record-breaking amounts of snowfall that occurred early in the semester.
Anelli told audience members – some of whom donned Hogwarts outfits – how themes from the series tied into her experiences as both a Leaky Cauldron contributor and a Georgetown alum.
Anelli described Rowling’s humble beginnings, writing her novel in coffee shops while taking care of her baby. Anelli said Rowling was not expecting anything other than a modest income. “She was hoping she’d only have to work part time,” said Anelli.
She also spoke of her experiences at Georgetown.
“I came here with my own perfect flawless plan,” Anelli said.
“I came in to be a doctor, that was my plan, but in my first week, I walked into THE HOYA, and I had a great time, and within a year, I had completely changed my plan, to become a reporter, to be an English major,” Anelli said in an exclusive video interview with THE HOYA after the event.
She told students, “Whatever you spend your free time doing, that might be an inkling about what you should do with your future.”
Anelli, who served as an editor for THE HOYA during her time at Georgetown and now works as a writer for the Staten Island Advance, claimed that she “felt out of the loop” at THE HOYA, but discovered her passion for journalism after discussing several of the Harry Potter novels with a fellow editor. She told the audience that they all needed to experience that “moment you connect with someone over something you love and care about.”
She also talked about technology’s role in the popularity of the Harry Potter series. “Harry Potter [fans were] the first group of fans to seize the Internet and use it for their own means,” Anelli said. She described trying earnestly to find out when the sixth Harry Potter book would be published; along the way, she came across The Leaky Cauldron, which she soon began to write for.
Anelli spoke about the unprecedented popularity of the Harry Potter series, saying, “I don’t know if we’ll ever have a shared text like we did with Harry Potter.” However, she said that the discussions and popularity developed by Harry Potter would need to be continued for future books, which she said was already happening with other popular novels.
She emphasized the importance of staying excited about reading.
Anelli told the audience, “There’s a lot of hubbub about the iPad, and the death of the publishing industry, and the only response is to talk about books . as such fantastic things. We have to be engaged, alert, excited readers.”
The Leaky Cauldron Web site, which was originally founded in 2000 before the release of the fourth Harry Potter book, has rapidly expanded in the past 10 years. Originally just confined to one page, the Web site now has MyLeaky, a social networking program, and Pottercast, a series of podcasts on iTunes. J.K. Rowling has appeared on Pottercast, and according to The Leaky Cauldron Web site, Rowling even declared the Leaky Cauldron her personal favorite.
When asked about the relevance of the site after all the books and movies are released, Anelli said to THE HOYA, “We’re trying to be about more than just the Harry Potter books and the Harry Potter movies, but be about everything that Harry Potter’s been affected by, and everything Harry Potter’s affected.”
Lecture Fund and the Georgetown Program Board sponsored Anelli’s appearance. After the event,Anelli signed copies of her book, titled “Harry, a History.”
Hoya Staff Writer Caitlin Schwind contributed to this report.

This past week, one small Web site detailing the unruly behavior of Georgetown students off-campus garnered national attention (Saxaspeak [first reported](https://saxaspeak.thehoya.com/2010/04/27/drunken-georgetown-students474/) on the site Tuesday morning). While students have expressed outrage at its content, the site’s creator maintains that his target is not students, but rather the university administration.
“I couldn’t get through to anyone at the university. This is a cry for help,” Stephen Brown, the creator of drunkengeorgetownstudents.com, said.
The Web site was created last fall, according to Brown. After April 9, several posts, with photos depicting inebriated students on weekends and admonishing commentary from Brown, gained students’ interest as well as coverage by NBC, FOX and The Washington Post.
On Wednesday, the site’s original server, IBM HTTP Server, forced Brown to censor the site by blurring out faces of students on the pictures and deleting exact location references. Though Brown acquiesced, the server still closed the site at 7 p.m. on Wednesday. Brown said that there was no concrete reason offered by IHS. He then relocated the site to blogspot, another server.
Brown said he has the students’ best interests at heart, adding that the goal of the Web site is to pressure the administration into building more on-campus housing. He said that living conditions off-campus are often unsafe, citing the example of the house across the street from him, which is close to collapsing, according to Brown. Brown said that because there is not enough housing on campus, students are forced to move into unsafe houses owned by corrupt landlords, who are not abiding by safety regulations.
“This is not only about student behavior, but rather it is about Georgetown’s responsibility and the safety of its students,” Brown said.
Students expressed doubt that Brown is actually concerned for their well-being, however.
“Mr. Brown’s intentions sound noble if he actually wants to help Georgetown students get fairer housing, but somehow I don’t think those are his true motivations,” Taylor Lescallette (SFS ’12) said.
The university does not intend to alter its construction plans, despite Brown’s concerns. Andy Pino, director of media relations, said that the university was not planning to build additional undergraduate housing on campus. Eighty-four percent of undergraduates are housed on campus currently.
“We are not proposing to increase our traditional undergraduate enrollment over the 10-year period of the 2010 Campus Plan, and we have not seen any increase in demand for beds that would support the construction of additional undergraduate housing, particularly in light of several other competing projects including, for example, athletic, library and student activity facilities,” Pino said.
Brown opposed the campus plan vehemently, as well as the university’s lack of response to his queries. He said that only now, following the popularity of the Web site, was he granted a meeting with university administrators. Brown said the popularity of the site could prove detrimental to the university, and he was therefore putting pressure on the administration.
While Brown, a former professor at American University, maintained that he loves students, he distinguished between sober and drunk students and said he has no qualms with publishing information about the behavior of intoxicated undergraduates.
“Insisting on rights to privacy is silly. Stand up for your actions. Be proud of what you do. If you’re drunk on the street, then own that,” Brown said.
Brown said that he would continue publishing content on his Web site and students should be aware that when they are on the street, they are in the public domain and can be documented.
“When you see me with a camera pointing at you, expect it to be followed up with a call to the police,” Brown said.
Brown had no plans to put the photos back on the site in their uncensored version, saying he doesn’t have the time to deal with any potential lawsuits that may arise. He is, however, intent upon adding new content to the site, posting advice to other residents on how to best report students, including calling 911, and encouraging them to document students and submit pictures and other information to his Web site.
Walter Hillabrant, vice president of the Burleith Citizens Association, said he expects the site to continue growing, and that he plans to contribute to it.
“[The site is] provocative, interesting, [and] addresses a real problem but probably not in the best ways,” Hillabrant said. “Until a better forum is readily available, we need a way to document and depict and communicate the nature of gatherings that involve binge drinking and alcohol abuse, loud parties, public urination and other antisocial behaviors – all often occurring at late hours.”
Pino concurred that the site was not the best medium for addressing Brown’s concerns.
“We do not believe the site is a constructive attempt to improve safety or quality of life issues in our community, and we believe it runs contrary to the collaborative efforts we’ve engaged in with many of our neighbors,” Pino said.

The oldest LGBT newspaper in the country will hit the stands again this Friday after going bankrupt in November 2009. It has been publishing under a different name since then.
The Washington Blade has chronicled the gay rights movement since its inception in 1969. It is considered America’s gay newspaper of record, reporting LGBT news locally, nationally and internationally. When Window Media, the parent company of The Washington Blade, went bankrupt back in November, the weekly newspaper continued to produce under the name D.C. Agenda. Former editor Kevin Naff indicated that due to emotional ties, however, reinstating the original name of the publication was important.
In February, members of the Blade’s old staff purchased the company and all its assets, including copyright, trademark, archives, computers and office furniture for $15,000, according to The Washington Post. Brown Naff Pitts Omnimedia, founded by publisher Lynne Brown, Naff, sales executive Brian Pitts and other former Blade employees, is the new company that bought the Blade.
The Blade’s 40-year mission of community service and quality, award-winning journalism will continue,” Naff said in an interview with The Washington Post.
As the Blade returns to newsstands on Friday, the D.C. Agenda will not disappear – the revamped Blade will use it as the title of the arts and entertainment section of the paper.
Naff also told The Washington Post that he expected a warm reception for the restored paper.
“A lot of people really have an emotional connection to the Blade, and the outpouring since it closed was overwhelming and was really what led us to carry on,” Naff said.
Brown highlighted goals for the new version of the paper on the Blade’s Web site.
“We now have the opportunity to both restore and refresh a powerful, venerable news gathering institution and to make the treasure trove of our vibrant gay rights and liberation movement history accessible to the public,” Brown said.
Naff is optimistic that the paper’s supporters will help the Blade be successful its second time around.
“We are expecting an increase in readership as we re-launch. We’ve never had more readers and there’s never been more news to cover than now,” said Naff.
However, like any other newspaper, the Blade will have to face the challenge of surviving in a dying industry of print news. Figures released by the Audit Bureau of Circulation last Monday show that average weekday newspaper sales are down by 8.7 percent from last year.
Naff still thinks the Blade can handle the challenge with the help of its readers.
“The Blade is no different from any other media outlet in that we must continue to innovate, adapt and engage our audience to thrive,” Naff said.

From hate crime to “Hate Free,” it was a rollercoaster year for Georgetown’s LGBTQ community. After the events of fall 2009 caused some to doubt whether the university had progressed as far as had been thought, a group of passionate students fought to redefine life on the Hilltop for those who felt unsafe and unseen.
Flashback
Everything changed for Georgetown’s gay community in the fall of 2007 – or so it seemed.
That semester, two students were targeted in anti-gay incidents: one was reportedly assaulted near campus by men shouting slurs, while another was shoved in a similar incident a month later.
These reports prompted an intense push for recognition by LGBTQ students. In Red Square and the office of the university president, participants in the Out For Change campaign petitioned the administration for attention and action.
They were successful. University President John J. DeGioia committed to ensuring that campus was informed more quickly of possible hate crimes, dedicated administrators to meet the needs of gay students and agreed to open a resource center for LGBTQ students. The students behind Out For Change achieved their foremost goal on Aug. 26, 2008, when the center opened.
“This is just a huge victory for us,” GU Pride Co-President Scott Chessare (SFS ’10) said after DeGioia acquiesced to student demands in October 2007. “I don’t think we could be any more happy or thrilled than we are right now.”
It looked like Georgetown’s often tense relationship with its LGBTQ community had turned a corner. “It seemed that things had gotten better,” Lauren Cucarola (COL ’10) said. “It seemed like things were working.”
Déjà Vu
But this past fall, the safety of LGBTQ students at Georgetown returned to the forefront of campus discussion. Over the course of two weeks, a rash of anti-gay incidents seized the Hilltop’s attention.
On Oct. 27, two men allegedly assaulted a female student wearing a pro-gay rights shirt on Canal Road; the men made comments about her perceived sexual orientation before striking her. On Nov. 1, a student was reportedly physically assaulted near the intersection of 36th and N Streets by an assailant who used anti-gay language.
On Nov. 2, LGBTQ Resource Center Director Sivagami Subbaraman found a note containing a slur (which, she said, was directed at her) fixed to the door of the center’s office. On Nov. 11, graffiti containing anti-gay language was discovered in Copley Hall.
The string of “bias-related incidents,” as DPS referred to them, provoked surprise and outrage on campus. “Everyone’s response was, `I thought this was over,'” Cucarola said.
Chessare said he saw parallels to the events of 2007. “What we saw in 2007 is happening again,” he said in November. “Clearly, after two years and the creation of the LGBTQ Resource Center, we haven’t solved the problem.”
“The creation of the resource center wasn’t the end of the issue,” Carter Lavin (SFS ’10) said. “It was the end of the university’s negligence.”
A Community Mobilizes
As in 2007, members and supporters of the LGBTQ community responded quickly and publicly.
On Oct. 30, about 50 students gathered in Red Square for a rally; two days later, after news of the second assault broke, Lavin organized a “flash rally” that took place in Red Square.
“Hate crimes are ridiculous / my Georgetown is better than this,” students chanted as they formed a circle at dusk. The rally ended with a brief march and was followed by a GU Pride meeting at which students discussed steps to ensure the safety of gay students on and near campus.
On Nov. 2, over 150 students, faculty and administrators descended on Red Square for an evening vigil, which featured a visit by a representative of Gay Men and Lesbians Opposing Violence, a D.C. support organization, as well as Jewish and Catholic prayers.
Following the events of late October and November, students formed what Cucarola called an “unofficial working group” to recommend ways for the university to make students safer. Lavin, who was part of this group, stressed that safety – for gay and straight students alike – was the key issue.
“The university needs to take student security a lot more seriously. . There are infrastructural changes that the university could make,” he said. According to Lavin, wage increases for DPS officers (which came to pass in February), heightened neighborhood patrols and greater student awareness were priorities of students in the working group.
Lavin said he has seen improvement. “I’ve seen evidence that the general security problem is becoming more obvious to the student population,” he said.
Come Together
Perhaps the most visible response to the events of the fall came in March, when an unofficial group, Hate Free Georgetown, spearheaded a week of activities to promote unity and respect on campus. If you visited campus this spring, chances are you caught sight of the group’s logo – the Georgetown “G” circumscribing a peace sign – at some point.
Organized by Nomadic Theatre members Joshua Goode (COL ’10), Cucarola and a handful of others, Hate Free Georgetown Week included the distribution of flyers and a petition, an interfaith discussion, a lecture by Fr. Rick Curry, S.J., and a Georgetown University Grilling Society barbecue.
The week sought to promote understanding on campus among different groups, according to Cucarola. “We wanted to do something that could change the culture,” she said.
“[The week] was a response to the attacks in the fall, but it wasn’t just for LGBTQ protection. . It was for respect from every member of this campus to everyone on this campus,” Goode said.
Goode emphasized Hate Free Georgetown’s efforts to engage the entire community by enlisting a number of campus institutions for support. The Corp, the Georgetown University Student Association, Nomadic Theatre, GU Pride and the Diversity Action Council contributed funding.
This support from the broader community suggests Hate Free Georgetown may be a sustainable enterprise, according to Goode and Cucarola.
“We’d definitely like to see it continue,” Cucarola said. “Now we know it can be done.”
“I don’t think we do enough to dispel the misconceptions we have about campus,” Goode said.
Still, Lavin said, Georgetown has more to learn in the wake of the fall’s incidents. “Yes, you can still be Catholic and yes, you can still care about your LGBTQ students,” he said.
Only with a strong commitment on campus can students – of all backgrounds – feel safe, Lavin said.
Only with the sorts of efforts that followed those difficult weeks in October and November can Georgetown ensure that history does not repeat itself again.

Students, faculty and staff celebrated four years of progress by Georgetown’s LGBTQ community at yesterday’s Lavender Graduation in a crowded Copley Formal Lounge.
University President John J. DeGioia praised the work of graduating seniors in establishing the LGBTQ Resource Center and calling attention to issues facing LGBTQ students.
“You each have helped make our campus safer and more welcoming for all students,” he said. “We are a better and stronger Georgetown for your efforts.”
About 40 undergraduates and six graduate students were honored in the ceremony. In particular, Scott Chessare (SFS ’10), Marion Cory (COL ’10), Olivia Chitayat (COL ’10), Jheanelle Brown (SFS ’10), health educator Danielle Desilvis and Outlaw, a Law Center organization, were given awards for their work on behalf of the LGBTQ community.
“I’m very proud to be receiving [an award], but I feel the award is a recognition of the work a whole group of people have done,” Chessare said.
Chessare said his proudest accomplishment was helping to establish the LGBTQ Resource Center, which opened in 2008.
Keynote speaker Kara Swisher (SFS ’84), who writes for the Wall Street Journal and is a former HOYA reporter, spoke about the challenges she endured as a gay student at Georgetown.
“This was about the worst selection that I could have made,” she said of her choice to attend Georgetown. “There were a lot of attacks on gays.”
Swisher, who lived in the neighborhood after she graduated, has only returned to campus twice since she graduated.
“There was an appalling lack of knowledge about gays,” she said. “[The atmosphere] just encouraged behavior that was just appalling.”
She said she left Georgetown “incredibly disheartened,” but is pleased with the changes that have come about in the past quarter century.
“This [ceremony] happening is a shock to me,” she said.
Swisher said she continued to face hostility after graduating, including from her mother, who kicked her out of the house for being gay and initially refused to attend her wedding. Eventually, she furtively watched the ceremony and gave a toast at the reception. Swisher said her mother’s gradual change of heart was emblematic of the country as a whole.
“You make tiny little progresses, and sometimes you make great progress, but there’s always pushback,” she said.
Swisher said in an interview that writing for The Hoya gave her a way to express herself as a gay student.
“It kept me here despite being unhappy being gay,” she said.

A recent study shows that students are finding it increasingly difficult to distance themselves from the extensive reach of social media as technology continues to develop in the Information Age, making life without instantaneous status updates almost unimaginable.
The International Center for Media and the Public Agenda at the University of Maryland conducted a study earlier this year in which it asked 200 students to refrain from all social media for 24 hours. After an entire day of ignoring their Facebook and e-mail accounts and turning off Blackberries and iPhones, the students were asked to reflect on their experiences in a blog. A university news release reported that students claimed they were “in withdrawal,”extremely antsy,”miserable” and “crazy,” according to The Washington Post.
Students reported being disgusted with their dependency on social media, with some noticing physical affects, such as fidgeting, and others claiming they felt completely alone and isolated from other humans, according to The Washington Post.
Diana Owen, associate professor of political science and the director of American studies, did not know of any plans to conduct a similar study at Georgetown, but she appreciated the work done at the University of Maryland.
“I am not surprised by the findings of the UMD study that some students experience physical and psychological withdrawal when they are separated from their digital devices for a single day,” Owen said in an e-mail.
Owen highlighted the positive effects that the technological evolution has had on the learning environment here at Georgetown, but she also noted the drawbacks of having certain devices easily accessible.
“The impact of media and technology on student learning is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, new technologies offer increased learning opportunities, especially as they facilitate access to information, interactive learning, and innovation in the presentation of knowledge. However, they are an impediment to student learning on a variety of fronts,” Owen said.
Georgetown students expressed both amazement and understanding at the reactions of their peers at UMD. Irene Chang (SFS ’10) thought that she would be able to handle 24 hours without any form of social media.
“I think I’ve done it before. It depends. If you’re occupied and have something that you’re doing, then I feel like you wouldn’t really think about it if you’re already with friends or with people, but if you’re not really busy or not with people, it could be more of an issue,” Chang said.
Helen Lee (NHS ’11) believed she could live without some forms of social media, too, but was a little concerned about missing one form in particular.
“I think that [going without] Internet and Facebook and stuff wouldn’t be that bad, but [without a] phone. I’d get kind of antsy,” Lee said.
Sara Nichols (COL ’11) was confident that she could keep herself away from social media for an entire day.
“I could go without social media, but everyone else would miss me too much. Gotta keep the people happy,” Nichols said via text message.

After an academic year that saw a gunshot in McDonough Gymnasium, a string of bias-related assaults against members of the LGBTQ community, a number of burglaries in university-owned student residences and multiple sexual assaults, many Georgetown students are increasingly concerned about their safety and the measures the university is taking to ensure it.
“Maybe crimes are just reported more, but I really think that our campus has gotten less safe, and it seems like more people are able to assault and pinpoint Georgetown students than ever before,” Kirsten Hardy (SFS ’11) said.
While the total number of crimes has not increased from past years, the nature of many of the crimes this year has shaken the community’s sense of security. Department of Public Safety Associate Director Joseph Smith said that there has been an increase in crimes against persons, but also a downturn in property crime, particularly bike thefts.
DPS crime logs for the month of March 2010 include 35 incidents ranging from burglary to sexual assault to theft to drug violations to public indecency. In contrast, the crime log of March 2009 reported a total of 51 incidents; many of these were property damage, such as graffiti or defacement with paint. Comparisons between the crime logs for January and February of the two academic years show similar trends.
Major incidents this academic year included the firing of a gun belonging to off-duty Park Police officer Sherice Clanton during the Midnight Madness rally in October, which led to the arrest of then-McDonough School of Business freshman Alex Thiele. Thiele was later sentenced to 18 months probation and a $100 fine, and is presently in the custody of his parents in California. (See page 11.) In the same month, an employee of the Leavey Center Cosi restaurant was tied to a chair and robbed at knife-point, leading to the theft of nearly $2,000.
Two bias-related assaults against students seen as members of the LGBTQ community occurred near campus in the same week in late October and early November, followed closely by a report of verbal harassment just off campus and the discovery of anti-gay graffiti in Copley Hall. (See page 3.)
Burglaries and robberies have also marred the crime logs of this academic year. The rooms of seven students in McCarthy Hall were burglarized on Halloween, and five juveniles were apprehended and barred from campus for a similar set of burglaries in the building on Nov. 15. On Nov. 30 an employee of Yates Field House was assaulted and robbed. In early December a student was assaulted and robbed at gunpoint in Glover Park. In January, a burglary in Village C West and a robbery on O Street were reported on the same night. At least four burglaries or attempted burglaries took place within two blocks of Healy Gates within a nine-day period in March. Two robberies in the same block in Burleith, one at gunpoint, occurred nine days apart in late March and early April. Most recently, two students were sexually assaulted in a seven-day period, one in a stairwell in Copley Hall.
On the other hand, reports of sexual assaults significantly declined from the previous academic year. Arlington, Va., resident Todd Thomas was sentenced to prison in March for a series of burglaries and sexual assaults, but it is unlikely that all of the crimes colloquially attributed to the “Georgetown Cuddler” were committed by him, based on DPS records.
Over the course of the year, DPS has instated a number of new measures to improve campus safety, according to Smith. These include implementing the Rape Aggression Defense program, assigning a hate crimes and LGBTQ-related crimes officer, creating a team to monitor DPS response to sexual assaults and domestic and dating violence for quality assurance purposes, hiring contract security to supplement DPS coverage during emergency conditions, hiring a new crime prevention coordinator and a supervisory investigator, and enhancing student guard training.
DPS officers also received a $2.50 per hour pay raise under a new three-year contract approved in February, after negotiations that began the previous August. Student rallies had taken place during the fall semester in support of better compensation for officers.
Many students, however, are still unsatisfied with DPS.
Hardy cites a recent incident in which she was studying in Lauinger Library on a Thursday night and allowed a friend to exit and re-enter using her GOCard. A DPS officer arrived on the scene and confiscated both students’ GOCards overnight after filing a report.
“I am utterly appalled that this is the way DPS officers are choosing to use their authority, while I have literally felt unsafe walking from Lauinger to LXR at night recently because of the crime going on,” Hardy said.
The student guard program has also drawn criticism.
“Many friends have told me that they have walked into Copley without being swiped in properly or at all, which is especially disturbing because of the sexual assault that recently took place in the building,” Marc Sella (MSB ’12) said.
About 150 student guards are presently employed to control access to New South, LXR, Darnall, Copley, Harbin, Village C, Reiss, Lauinger, McCarthy, Kennedy, Reynolds and Walsh, according to the DPS Web site.
The Student Guard Office declined to comment for this report.
The swiping system in Copley Hall was changed as of Feb. 1, 2010, in a pilot program to enhance residence hall safety. Student guards must now take entering students’ GOCards and verify them, rather than letting students swipe their own cards, as they do in other residence halls. DPS planned to expand this program to other dorms if it proved to be effective.
“We feel that this may be a more effective method of preventing unauthorized access to the hall,” Smith said at the time.
Despite the new security measures, a student was sexually assaulted in the stairwell of Copley on April 9, the first sexual assault reported to have occurred in an on-campus residence since September, according to DPS crime logs.
DPS hopes to instate a number of additional new safety measures in the future. These include the expansion of the RAD program to include training for men and children, improving the Adopt-A-Cop program, in which officers are assigned to individual residence halls and serve as the main point of contact for the students and Residence Life staff in that building, and installing a new communications and report management system, according to Smith. DPS is also in the project development stage of making their Web site more interactive and easier for students to use, including services such as bike registration, anonymous tips and RAD registration in one location. Smith hopes to have this process completed by fall 2010.
“Maintaining public safety in the open environment of the university presents many challenges to the university administration and the law enforcement professionals at DPS. Although we are making excellent use of our resources, we continually examine our processes, work quality and outcomes in an ongoing effort to improve our service to the Georgetown community,” Smith said.
