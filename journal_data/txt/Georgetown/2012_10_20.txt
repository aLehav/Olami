Two students were assaulted during a burglary of their home on the 3500 block of O Street early Saturday morning, according to the Department of Public Safety.
A DPS public safety alert emailed to the campus community at 9:45 Saturday morning reported that the two students noticed an intruder in their home around 3:45 a.m. The intruder struck both students and then fled toward campus. The students both sustained minor injuries.
The PSA describes the suspect as a 5-foot-10 21-year-old white male weighing about 160 pounds. He is further described as having brown hair and wearing a light blue shirt and blue jeans.
The Metropolitan Police Department is conducting the ongoing investigation of the incident.
