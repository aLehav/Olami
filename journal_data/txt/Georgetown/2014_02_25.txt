Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) and Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15) are in the lead in the race for GUSA executive, with 26.6 percent of likely voters choosing their ticket, according to a door-to-door poll conducted by The Hoya on Sunday evening.
Zach Singer (SFS ’15) and Dan Silkman (COL ’15) ranked in second place, with 18.8 percent of likely voters, and Ben Weiss (COL ’15) and Sam Greco (SFS ’15) came in third with 16.9 percent. Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) and Jimmy Ramirez (COL ’15) received 9.5 percent of the vote, and 28.2 percent of likely voters remained undecided. 
The poll sampled 772 students, 515 of whom identified as likely voters, and from whom this data was drawn. Of these 515 likely voters, 168 were freshmen, 151 were sophomores, 118 were juniors and 78 were seniors. 
“These numbers are encouraging and show that our message is really starting to resonate with Georgetown students,” Tezel said. “That being said, it’s clear that we’re going to have to move full steam ahead. This is going to be an incredibly close election.” 
“The fact that Trevor’s in first is to be expected; he’s been running for the longest amount of time and of all the candidates has the most ingrained support,” Singer said. “The fact that we’re pretty close shows that there are a lot of great candidates out there talking about the issues.” 
While Tezel led the poll when respondents were asked, “Who do you plan to vote for?” many students thought that Singer would be in the lead. When asked, “Who do you think is the frontrunner in the race?” 35.1 percent of all respondents — not just likely voters — answered Singer and Silkman. Weiss and Greco were seen as the frontrunner by 29.4 percent of respondents, and Tezel and Jikaria were seen as the frontrunner by 26.6 percent. 
“I think that comes from the good presence Dan and I have built over two and a half years on campus. Talking to a lot of people, this was a pretty good team we’re putting together — respect for that, respect for the ticket we can bring together, that’s where the frontrunner status comes from,” Singer said. “As GUSA chief of staff, I think it comes with the territory as well. We’ll see how that plays out — now people have seen our name for a while, and hopefully it’ll turn into votes.” 
Tezel suspected Singer’s status as the perceived frontrunner stemmed from his platform. 
“I think that probably speaks to the platform from which Zach and Dan are running. They’re certainly trying to run as the candidate of the GUSA institution of the current administration. That kind of approach might give students that idea,” Tezel said. “However, I’m reassured by these results because it shows that regardless of what students expect the next GUSA administration to look like, they have a very clear idea what they want. What they want is going to be the results we see on election day.” 
Weiss was surprised by his own results in this category.
“I’m very surprised we had a high number of people assume we’re the frontrunners,” Weiss said. “I hope over the next few days I can convince a few of those people we are the right choice to lead the student body next year.” 
The poll also revealed a gender gap between Singer’s and Tezel’s supporters. Among likely female voters, Tezel received 31.3 percent of the vote while Singer received 14.4 percent of the likely female vote. Conversely, Singer received 24.8 percent of the vote among likely male voters, while Tezel took 20.7 percent among men likely to vote. 
“I think a lot’s been made of Omika being the only woman in the field over the last couple of days. News coverage, it’s painted the other candidates in a light that’s a little different. There’s a lot more women on our campaign team. … It’s not from a lack of women on our team,” Singer said. “With a 10-point spread, I think it’s fair to say there’s a gender gap. Ideally we’d seek to narrow that spread a little bit.”
“I think a breakdown like that might in some ways speak to the effort on the part of our ticket, not just in Omika’s gender, but in the policies we’re supporting and the way we’re going about doing that, so that appeals to female voters,” Tezel said. “I don’t think you could entirely contribute that gender gap to the fact that we have a female on our ticket, while at the same time I don’t think you can ignore that fact.” 
Lloyd, who is president of GU Pride, led among voters who identified as LGBTQ, with 36.7 percent of the vote. However, the sample size for this category was small, with only 42 LGBTQ respondents and 30 who identified as likely voters. 
“I would expect to be in the first or second choice of the vast majority of LGBTQ folks on campus,” Lloyd said. 
Lloyd and Weiss also responded to their respective positions in these results.
“It’s pretty much what I was expecting,” Weiss said. “This is one of the more competitive races I remember. Both Trevor and Omika and Zach and Dan have run incredible campaigns. I’m pretty happy we’re right there with them, from what I can tell.”
“Obviously it’s disappointing to us,” Lloyd said. “On one hand, Jimmy and I were the last ticket to assemble — we had the slowest ground game coming out of the gate. The last few days are the time to turn some of those undecided voters. With The Voice endorsement and my performance in the debate, we look forward to picking off parts of the other tickets in other rounds of voting.”

NATASHA THOMSON/THE HOYAAdam Mortillaro (COL ’13) helped sell concessions to benefit Dog Tag Bakery at the men’s rugby fundraiser at MultiSport Facility on Friday.The Georgetown University Rugby Football Club raised $6,000 for Dog Tag Bakery, a nonprofit organization aimed at enabling disabled veterans through entrepreneurship, with an intrasquad round-robin tournament on Friday.
The idea for the fundraiser started a few years ago, when former GURFC President Robert Rosa (COL ’14), as a sophomore, took a class taught by bakery founder Fr. Richard Curry, S.J. Curry approached Rosa and the men’s rugby team this past May and asked to plan an event.
Curry came up with the idea of the Georgetown bakery, located just off of Wisconsin Avenue on Grace Street, in 2011 as an effort to help veterans and their families get back on their feet by working at the bakery. According to Dog Tag Bakery Chief Operating Officer Meghan Ogilvie, 35 years of working closely with veterans has prepared Curry for this venture.
“It’s a work-study program for veterans with disabilities and their spouses. The idea is that they go through a tailor-made program in the School of Continuing Studies in entrepreneurship and small business and communication, and then they work in our bakery so they get the experience of what it is to run a business or start it,” Ogilvie said.
The first employee was hired in 2012, and the bakery, although still under construction, looks to launch this summer and start its program by employing 10 to 12 veterans.
Rosa said the fundraiser, which was finalized in November, spoke to the Jesuit values of the university.
“I wanted to do this because Father Curry has helped so many people and doesn’t ask for anything in return, so we really wanted to give back to him. It was for the veterans, but it was also for him because he’s such an incredible person who has helped so many,” Rosa said.
The team absorbed associated costs to ensure that all ticket sales went to the bakery.
“Any of the costs that we had to pay for referees and things we just kind of took on ourselves, so all the ticket sales and donations went directly to the bakery and the vets,” Rosa said.
In order to create the teams, the rugby captain and President Alex Skarzynski (SFS ’15), rugby captain Conor Shea (MSB ’15), former President Rosa and captain Jack Sheridan (COL ’14) drafted from the roster.
“We went up and down through our players and just drafted the teams, it was pretty subjective. We wanted it to be random,” Shea said.
The four teams played a round-robin format, with no clear winner, but Skarzyinski’s team held the best record of 3-0-1.
Shea noted that the fundraiser was a great way for the entire team to get more experience in the game of sevens, as most rugby games require 15 players.
“We are definitely going to do it again next year because it raised a lot of money, and it was a really good time,” Shea said. “It was really good experience for a lot of the new guys who hadn’t had a game yet this season. Sevens is more ball-handling and passing-related compared to 15s, so they learned a lot more of the fundamentals and got more experience.”
In addition to the games, the Georgetown University Grilling Society contributed burgers to the cause. Rosa hopes that the event, which attracted over 100 people, will be even larger and more successful in the coming years.
“My idea in setting it up this year was to lay the ground work. Next year, my hope is that other teams will come and play, like GW and American,” Rosa said.
Although Rosa is graduating, the underclassmen on the team hope to carry out the tradition and cultivate the success of such fundraising tournaments.
“As a freshman, it was a really fun event. I’m excited that it’s going to become an annual thing because it will only become more successful, so I’m excited to be here to make it grow,” Michael Hosbein (NHS ’17) said.
“All of the guys were really on board just because of what the cause was. It was just a very small thing we can do for these men and women who are willing to sacrifice everything, a small showing of our gratitude for these heroes who have given everything for our country,” Rosa said.
Special to the Hoya

Candidates for the 2014 Georgetown University Student Association executive election have submitted their proposed administrative budgets for the upcoming year. These budgets illustrate similar fiscal plans among the different campaigns regarding aspects of GUSA responsibility, although, in some instances, candidates have chosen to allocate sums of money to fund unique initiatives.
Presidential hopeful Ben Weiss (COL ’15) and his running mate Sam Greco (SFS ’15) requested $49,500 in university funding, the most of any ticket. This was followed by Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) and Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15), who asked for $44,800, and Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) and Jimmy Ramirez (COL ’15), whose budget called for $43,600 in spending. Zach Singer (SFS ’15) and Dan Silkman (COL ’15) requested the least amount of money, asking for $39,800 in funding.
Last year, the current executive pair of Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) and Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) called for $44,600 in their proposed budgets.
Tisa justified the slightly increased budget proposals of the running candidates.
“All four [candidates] budgets are slightly larger than past years’, which seems appropriate. As GUSA continues to grow, it makes sense that our budget also exhibits responsible growth,” Tisa said.
Even though much of GUSA funding is discretionary, all candidate teams are required to allocate $14,000 for Collegiate Readership, which provides copies of The New York Times, The Washington Post and USA Today in selected locations across campus. All candidates have chosen to allocate $1,500 toward the Georgetown University Farmers Market, which is held on Copley Lawn during the spring and fall.
Additionally, Tezel requested $20,000 for the GUSA Fund, Weiss’ and Singer’s budgets called for $15,000 for the fund, while Lloyd’s proposal asked for only $12,000 to fulfill this purpose. On all budgetary proposals, the GUSA Fund occupies the largest non-mandatory allocation for the campaign.
“The GUSA Fund has been a huge help in co-sponsoring dozens of group events and individual initiatives. Right now it receives $15,000, but we think its performance has justified more,” Tisa said.
Weiss and Greco’s budget, in addition to including standard items like $2,000 in executive discretionary funding, also includes some unique proposals, including paying $1,500 for the implementation of a “Food Truck Friday,” $2,500 for a dedicated community service day and $1,000 for the inception and development of Encyclopedia Georgiopolitanica, which according to the platform website will be an “encyclopedia detailing the history of Georgetown’s students, student life and student organizations.”
The Georgetown-centric encyclopedia is just one of Weiss and Greco’s planned innovations. Their campaign also aims to allocate $5,000 towards the creation of a new Georgetown website, hoyalife.com, that would serve as a central location for various services, including a place for study room reservations, an events calendar and job listings.
“Ben and Sam will work to create hoyalife.com, the ultimate website for every student service at Georgetown,” Weiss and Greco’s platform states. “Altogether, hoyalife.com will finally unite all those disparate student services in one, easily accessible service.”
Lloyd and Ramirez’s budget most notably allocates $4,500 toward the “What’s a Hoya?” program, an orientation initiative designed to introduce freshman to university values and opportunities. Under their platform, the current program would be expanded to encompass different events promoting particularly beneficial messages or causes for students. This initiative would “allow student groups to have their events branded by GUSA as ‘What’s A Hoya?’ events,” Lloyd and Ramirez’s platform states. “These events will talk critically about safety, diversity and social justice.”
In addition, Lloyd and Ramirez seek to promote sustainability projects on campus, improve accessibility and hold an art fair and showcase, supporting each of these initiatives with a proposed $1,500 fund allocation. Lloyd’s ticket is also requesting $2,250 to make improvements to Georgetown athletic facilities, including the renovation of North Kehoe Field and the refurbishment of currently underutilized spaces, such as Harbin Patio.
Singer and Silkman’s campaign also specifically allocates funding to expand the “What’s a Hoya?” program, although their proposal only asks for $2,000 for this purpose.
“By expanding ‘What’s A Hoya?’ to partner with more groups and offer new and additional types of programming, GUSA will help expose freshmen to new perspectives,” Singer and Silkman wrote in a campaign statement. “Much of the $2,000 in the budget will go to support these events, organized and executed by other groups.”
Singer and Silkman’s budget also sets aside $1,000 for the Leadership Fund, an institution designed to provide financial support to students seeking to run for various elected positions on campus, and dedicates $2,000 to an “Innovation Fund,” which will provide financial resources for unanticipated projects that develop throughout the year. In addition, their budget allocates $500 for a research symposium and $1,300 for the GUSA senate to use as discretionary funding.
Tezel and Jikaria’s budget allocates $2,000 to the reinstitution of TurboVote, an online program designed to enroll Georgetown students as voters in national, state and local elections. The program was instituted under the administration of Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13), but was not included last year under Tisa and Ramadan.
The pair’s budget also requests funds for an undergraduate research symposium, the “RU Ready” sexual assault prevention initiative, an initiative paying for students to go out for coffee with professors called “ProfCoff” and the conduction of a report on university accessibility, designed to prompt a reconsideration of the university’s disability policy.
Another notable difference in Tezel’s budget is its lack of any funding to the Student Advocacy Office. Lloyd’s campaign has pledged $750 to this organization, which lobbies on the behalf of students charged with disciplinary violations, and Weiss and Singer both plan to provide the SAO with $500.
The SAO, which is officially a part of the GUSA executive, will not endorse a particular candidate. However, organizational advocates are free to work with and support whoever they please. SAO co-Director Ben Manzione (SFS ’15) said that funding is not essential to maintaining their services.
“I appreciate all of the support the SAO has gotten from all of the tickets. An increasing in funding wouldn’t necessarily help. The main reason the SAO has been successful has been because of the dedication of our advocates and the partnerships we have formed with the administration, allowing us to advocate for change,” Manzione said. “The university has committed itself to the success of the SAO, so the increase of in funding is not essential.”
According to Tisa, the actual administrative budget ended up being less than the proposal, after the GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee made cuts, although specific figures were not available as of press time.

All but one of the four campaign tickets running in the 2014 Georgetown University Student Association executive election received endorsements from student organizations, although all have received significant support from individuals across campus.
Last year, 15 student groups officially endorsed candidates, overall, compared to this year’s nine. However, 10 of those 15 groups declined to endorse a ticket this year.
Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) and Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15) received endorsements from Hoyas for Immigrant Rights, Club Boxing, the Secular Student Alliance and the Graduate Student Organization, while Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) and Jimmy Ramirez (COL ’15) received endorsements from The Georgetown Voice, GU Pride and Cristo Rey Tutoring. Zach Singer (SFS ’15) and Dan Silkman (COL ’15) have received official support from the College Academic Council. At this moment, no student groups are publically endorsing the ticket of Ben Weiss (COL ’15) and Sam Greco (SFS ’15), although several individual student leaders have supported their campaign.
Hoyas for Immigrant Rights voiced its support for Tezel and Jikaria’s campaign largely due to hopes for greater representation in GUSA and increased institutional support to address the needs of undocumented students, according to treasurer Chris Wager (SFS ’17).
According to Secular Student Alliance President Dennis Mai (COL ’15), Tezel and Jikaria are best equipped to assist student groups in advocatin against administrative bureaucratic policies, like those concerning room reservations. The SSA also identified with the ticket’s emphasis on free speech.
Additionally, the Graduate Student Organization, GUSA’s equivalent body for the Georgetown graduate student population, endorsed Tezel and Omika’s campaign. According to GSO President Samuel Osea, (COL ’12, GRD ’14), Tezel reached out directly to him to discuss how the groups could work better together if he is elected, an action that prompted Osea to make the first ever endorsement of an undergraduate candidate in the group’s history.
“All these candidates have a vision, a mission of what they want to do with GUSA, but Trevor is the only one who reached out to us,” Osea said. “I think that was really proactive of him and really speaks to his character as a leader.”
According to Club Boxing President Adan Gonzalez (COL ’15), Tezel and Jikaria give voice to a range of students.
“Our club has members from 23 countries; we are the most diverse club on campus and proud of it. Trevor and Omika’s multicultural council gives us a voice in the GUSA system that does not exist. They are leading with a plan, not just lip service by saying ‘we support pluralism,’” Gonzalez said.
In addition to groups, Tezel also received the support of Alex Cave (COL ’15), who served as Chair of the GU College Republicans when Tezel served as chair of GU College Democrats.
“I’m supporting Trevor and Omika because there’s nobody I’d trust more to advocate tirelessly on students’ behalf and achieve results,” Cave said.
Tezel expressed appreciation for the variety of groups and individuals that are supporting his campaign.
“We feel that the diversity of groups and individuals that have endorsed our ticket show that we have a platform to address a wide variety of student interests at Georgetown,” Tezel said. “Groups like HFIR and GSO have never endorsed in GUSA elections before, and we’re proud that our inclusive approach to GUSA is reflected in these endorsements.”
Lloyd and Ramirez received endorsements from several student groups, including GU Pride, of which Lloyd is currently president. Additionally, The Georgetown Voice’s editorial board released an editorial Feb. 20 expressing support for the Lloyd and Ramirez ticket, citing their commitment to representing the entire student populace. The Hoya’s editorial board also endorsed the ticket Feb. 25.
GU Pride released its endorsement, written by Trans* Representative Lexi Dever (COL ’16).
“Having directly benefitted from Thomas Lloyd’s leadership and abilities to advocate for our community at Georgetown, we see how passionate he is about serving marginalized communities and how effective he is at communication solutions,” the statement read.
Cristo Rey Tutoring highlighted the ticket’s attention to service and community outreach, as well as their desire to expand the Community-Based Learning program.
Lloyd noted that the groups who have voiced their support for his ticket embody the priorities he is seeking to emphasize as a campus leader.
“So far, these endorsements point to our bona fides on change making, diversity, advocacy and social justice priorities,” Lloyd said.
Singer and Silkman received the official endorsement of the College Academic Council, of which Silkman currently serves as Treasurer. According to CAC President Kamil Lupicki (COL ’14), Silkman’s work as a member of the organization prompted their endorsement of his campaign for GUSA executive.
“Through his role as treasurer and three years on the College Academic Council, Dan Silkman has shown his dedication to the Georgetown student body,” Lupicki said.“This is seen through his work with administrators to voice student concern regarding on-campus printing options and efforts to create a dialogue between the College Academic Council and the GUSA branch of academic affairs, among other initiatives.”
Singer believes the CAC endorsement brings credibility for academic changes and influence to the ticket.
“One big issue that comes up, especially recently, is that the provost’s decisions obviously have to do with academics, so the fact that the College Academic Council, the largest college of the four, endorsed us, shows that our vision … is something they agreed would be effective,” Singer said.
Individual supporters of Singer and Silkman are confident in the diverse student experience the ticket brings to GUSA.
“I think they represent exactly what GUSA needs right now, a great combination of student groups and GUSA experience. Dan has been involved in every club I think I’ve ever joined at Georgetown, from New South residence hall council, to Relay and [New Student Orientation] to Blue and Gray,” Mara Kelley (COL ’15) said.“He really understands student groups and understands their needs, and I think Zach has the GUSA experience that is also so necessary. I think together they have a great connection with the campus and the students and also have a great idea about the future and aren’t afraid to vocalize it.”
While the Weiss and Greco campaign does not have the official support of any student groups on campus, the campaign released a statement emphasizing their desire to appeal to individual voters rather than larger organizations.
“The Ben and Sam campaign has not actively sought the endorsement of student organizations, preferring to connect with voters on an individual level, rather than assume that common membership in a particular group means votes from group members will be the same,” the statement said. “We are, however, proud to have the support of student leaders from diverse groups across campus.”
Individuals who support Weiss and Greco include club golf vice captain and Georgetown Speechwriting Advisory Group President Will Simons (COL ’16).
“I’m supporting Ben and Sam because I believe that not only are they the most qualified candidates, I believe they have the best platform and the best approach to solving Georgetown’s problems,” Simons said. “I really do believe that Ben and Sam’s vision for Georgetown and where they want to take GUSA will be the most beneficial to students and will help students, as our social media campaign has said, achieve theirs.”
GUSA Senator and Vice Chair of the Committee on Intellectual Life Ken Nunnenkamp (MSB ’16) expressed similar sentiments, and particularly commended Weiss and Greco for their realistic ambitions.
“When I looked at the platforms this year, I was surprised by how much I really felt myself caring about it, I was like ‘this is something that is really effective, this is change that could really happen,’” Nunnenkamp said. “Ben and Sam are not guys who have their heads in the clouds, they’re guys who want to see real change.”
Former vice presidential candidate and former College Republicans Chair Maggie Cleary (COL ’14) also expressed her support for the ticket.
“As someone who is one of the only two-year veterans of the GUSA executive elections, I’d like to offer my endorsement for Ben and Sam. I’ve known Sam Greco since his freshmen year, and I have worked with him extensively during the past three GUSA campaigns,” Cleary said. “I have never met anyone on the Hilltop as effective as Greco. He is determined, hard-working, and knows the issues. I recently got to know Ben, and I’ve been very impressed with him.”

SOFIA LAYANTO FOR THE HOYAProposed ICC renovations include new study-friendly furniture and lighting.After the School of Foreign Service Academic Council rallied support through Georgetown Roundtables, an online forum where Georgetown students can pitch their ideas, renovation plans regarding the Intercultural Center are underway. Renovations will include the addition of student study space similar to that found in Regents Hall and the Rafik B. Hariri Building.
The SFSAC spearheaded these changes, believing the ICC Galleria to be a poorly designed space.
“We call the ICC our home, but no one studies there. It also looks really bad for Georgetown in general and the SFS tours,” SFSAC President Kyle Zhu (SFS ’14) said. “We say, ‘This building is the building for the SFS,’ and then you see students sitting on the ground because there are no seating spaces. It’s just unsavory to look at.”
The SFS Academic Council garnered support through its IdeaScale platform, which earned over 400 votes and strengthened the council’s proposal to the Office of the Provost.
“It’s great for us because we were able to put numbers to interest,” Zhu said.
The office had considered updating the ICC before the proposal’s inception, but it had not proceeded with this planning. After the SFSAC proposed renovating the ICC Galleria, the office expanded the idea to include adding study-friendly furniture to the elevator areas on the first and second floors.
“They’ve talked to the furniture company that did Regents and MSB and are going to contract with them to put those types of furniture in the first two floors,” SFSAC Vice President Megan Murday (SFS ’15) said.
Despite this collaboration, the project suffers from technical setbacks: Updating the building’s electricity and lighting will prove difficult. The ceiling is a skylight, which complicates hanging lights, and the concrete and brick floor needs to be taken apart in order to facilitate the addition of outlets.
“In order to fix some of the issues in the ICC like lighting, soundproofing, acoustics, electrical work, that actually requires a look at the entirety of the ICC and seeing how you would change everything,” Zhu said.
Procuring the desired furniture is also an issue since some fixtures include outlets.
“If they want to get tables that are integrated with the electrical system, so tables have outlets, that also requires looking at it. It’s all related, it’s all intertwined. So it’s kind of like everything is dependent on each other. So you need all your ducks in a row before you can really have a conversation about it,” Zhu said.
An engineering firm is currently exploring other alternatives, but the renovations remain stalled until these problems are resolved.
Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey has confirmed that his department will support the changes.
“We provide the planning, design and construction expertise for our clients. We integrate the clients’ programmatic requirements and, to the extent possible, ensure we meet the project goals, objectives and budget,” Morey wrote in an email.
Planning and Facilities Management will ensure that all codes are followed in order to avoid technical issues.
“Effective programming and planning and design can help mitigate technical challenges during construction activities while ensuring we meet our client’s requirements as well as building code compliance,” Morey wrote.
The first two floors of the ICC are more likely to undergo timely renovations because they do not suffer from the same structural complications as the upper floors.
The complexity of these structural issues precludes the SFS Academic Council from offering a time estimate for the project.
“[The Provost’s Office] doesn’t want us to talk about timeline yet, so out of respect to them we won’t. But the engineering firm is doing the study this semester,” Murday said.
However, the council hopes the new furniture will be moved into the first and second floors by the end of the semester.
According to Zhu, some professors have already raised opposition to the project because of potential noise problems. However, the proposal might include soundproofing offices in order to eliminate this problem.
“This issue of noise because professors who are faculty members who have offices in the space are already complaining about loud noises, and they are afraid that if you increase the volume or usability of the space, that that now is going to get out of control so how do we soundproof their offices or make it so that it’s not a bothersome thing?” Zhu said.
The changes will allow for more student traffic and might also affect More Uncommon Grounds, which is located in the ICC Galleria. The storefront might extend its hours to accommodate student traffic, but the preliminary nature of the plan precludes an imminent decision.
“We would absolutely be open to adjusting our schedule in response to student demand if traffic to the ICC increases, but we don’t need to make any firm decisions on this until the project is further along,” MUG Director and future Corp CEO Sam Rodman (MSB ’15) wrote in an email.
The ultimate goal of the project remains to transform the ICC into a space where student collaboration is possible.
“We see the ICC as a building that houses a lot of these classrooms, but it is a space where students go to class and then leave,” Murday said.
Kristen Sullivan (SFS ’17) expressed support for the project, which also aims to solidify a strong SFS identity through the establishment of a community location.
“I almost feel like each school has its own building. So SFS has ICC, the Nursing School has St. Mary’s or Reiss and then MSB has Hariri, so I feel like SFS students can identify the most with the ICC,” Sullivan said.
However, other students expressed doubts about the effectiveness of this project.
“You can’t add furniture and call something a study area,” John Harrison (COL ’16) said. “More student space is never a bad idea in theory, but ICC just doesn’t have the room to be an actual student space.”
There were also concerns about how long it would take to finish the serious changes like digging into the ICC concrete in order to update the lighting and electricity.
“I don’t really mind as long as it doesn’t exceed the four years, because then just from a selfish perspective, if it’s still under construction when I’m a senior and I just dealt with all the construction it’d be a little annoying,” Kathleen Daly (COL ’17) said.

In an effort to make on-campus housing more enticing to seniors, the university has shifted the housing selection process to favor rising seniors over rising juniors and eliminate barriers to securing housing eligibility for seniors, the Office of Residential Living announced in an email to current freshmen and sophomores Tuesday.
The university will implement these changes over the course of the next two years, and the changes will take full effect in the 2015-2016 academic year.
In the new system, rising seniors will receive priority over rising juniors in the housing selection process — a reversal of the current rules — and rising seniors will all receive equal eligibility points, regardless of whether or not they study abroad in the fall of their junior year. Juniors will, however, retain an advantage in the initial eligibility application.
Currently, rising seniors on campus for junior fall receive three housing points, and those who study abroad during that time receive four points. Juniors also receive four points.
Beginning with the Class of 2016, all seniors will be allotted four housing selection points regardless of whether or not they go abroad; all juniors will receive three points.
Executive Director of Residential Services Pat Killilee saw the change as an opportunity to give approximately 500 eligible seniors the chance to live where they want.
“You could have these senior communities, so a group of seniors who want to live together on campus can all be in a townhouse, they could be in the Village A rooftops, they can be in a Nevils,” Killilee said.
Killilee viewed the study-abroad distinction as unnecessary.
“The students that we worked with — and this is based with their conversations and feedback with their peers — they didn’t feel that there needed to be that differentiation, that you shouldn’t get extra points because you lived off campus the fall semester of your junior year,” Killilee said.
Additionally, Killilee took care to incorporate student preferences into the new housing timeline announced in the email, which will take effect starting with the Class of 2017. The housing eligibility process will now take place during the late spring of sophomore year instead of in October, followed by selection, which currently takes place in March.
“Between 55 and 60 percent, depending on the survey, said they wanted to see the housing selection process all in the spring semester. And only about 30 percent of the students surveyed wanted to keep it the way it was,” Killilee said.
“We sort of looked at the residential experience and how to better that,” Georgetown University Student Association Campus Living External Board appointee Megan Murday (SFS ’15) said. “And so as part of those conversations we started talking about how students pick housing, and how that’s a really disruptive time for students, and that it’s very stressful and that it doesn’t seem to really work well with anyone’s schedule.”
The Office of Residential Living included students throughout the restructuring process, from brainstorming to reviewing potential ideas. The office created a focus group composed of Killilee, Murday, Inter-Residence Hall Council Representative Molly Egilsrud (SFS ’15) and GUSA Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14).
“We would meet with Pat just to sort of figure out how we could make a system that better suits the current and future realities of Georgetown, and how to bring students back on campus and upperclassmen back on campus,” Murday said.
Implementation of the new housing timeline was postponed to next year because of to complaints from sophomores planning to study abroad next fall who would have been excluded from the process, an unforeseen challenge of the new timeline. Although the sophomore housing selection process has not been changed yet, minor changes do remain a possibility.
“The only other thing that we’re looking at right now is to see if we can manipulate the system so that students can pick blocks of rooms with their friends,” Murday said. “We really want to build sophomore communities. And so part of that might be transplanting some of the freshman communities onto a new floor.”
“These policies and procedures that you use … very few are set in stone, you really have to revisit them, because student culture changes and student needs change,” Killilee said.
Students have expressed satisfaction with this change.
“I think that is good, because I know it’s pretty popular for a lot of seniors to live off campus, but that is really expensive. I know a lot of seniors, personally, who can’t afford to live off campus and who are looking to have on-campus housing all four years,” Austin Wolff (COL ’16), who will be a senior when the change takes effect, said. “To me, just to know that there’s more of an appreciation for seniors living on campus, I don’t see a problem with it.”
Molly Robustelli (COL ’16), who will also be a senior during the 2015-2016 school year, has already signed a lease for off-campus housing during that year.
“If I hadn’t already figured out housing, it probably would make me re-evaluate which years I would want to live off campus,” she said. “But I would still want to live off campus either junior or senior year.”

COURTESY AMERICANS DESERVE BETTERNick Troiano (COL ’11, GRD ’13), at a 2013 rally for The Can Kicks Back, is exploring a congressional run for Pennsylvania’s 10th districtTwenty Georgetown alumni currently serve in Congress, 16 of whom were either elected or re-elected in the November 2012 election cycle.
Nick Troiano (COL ’11, GRD ’13) is looking to join that group in 2014; though, at 24, he would stand out from his peers as Congress’ youngest representative. Troiano will become eligible to run upon his 25th birthday.
Troiano announced Feb. 18 that he is exploring an independent, citizen-funded campaign in Pennsylvania’s 10th district, which has been represented since 2010 by Rep. Tom Marino (R-Pa.), who is seeking re-election in 2014.
Should Troiano win, he would join the ranks of Rep. William C.C. Claiborne, a Democratic-Republican from Tennessee elected to Congress at the age of 22 in 1797 as one of the youngest congressmen in history. Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-Fla.), 30, is the current youngest member of Congress.
Troiano is a James Madison fellow with the Millenial Action Project, a nonprofit that supports young, bipartisan leaders in an effort to fight political gridlock. A former Republican, Troiano says on his campaign website that he decided to run for Congress as an independent after the government shutdown in October.
Troiano hopes to become an advocate for millennials from the halls of Congress.
“Our generation is drastically underrepresented,” Troiano told The Hoya. “Six percent of our Congress is under 40, and there are no 20-somethings serving. So I feel that not only is my potential candidacy important for a step toward political reform, but it’s also important to give some voice to a generation that doesn’t have one in politics.”
Jeffry Burnam, a visiting professor in the department of government who taught Troiano several times and a man whom Troiano named as one of his inspirations for entering politics, agreed that Congress needs more youth representation.
“The average age of a congressman is 60, which is grossly unrepresentative of the general population,” Burnam said. “I think there’s a thirst for new faces. I think that people are hungry for new ideas and now solutions; they’re tired of gridlock.”
While 2008 saw a record high 49 percent of voter turnout for the younger generation, Troiano stressed the importance of young people involving themselves in politics beyond the ballot.
“We may have voted in the most numbers ever — for example, in 2008 — but our Congress is steadily growing older and older every year, largely because the people who are there are staying there longer and longer,” Troiano said.
Troiano’s platform, which he described as “a post-partisan platform for generational equity,” centers on fiscal responsibility, economic mobility and environmental sustainability. Troiano hopes to establish an organization that would lend support to young people attempting to enter politics, inspired by EMILY’s List, a political action committee that supports pro-choice, Democratic women.
“I think we need a similar organization just focused on young people to give them the encouragement and the tools,” Troiano said. “I’d like to prove a model for how a young person can successfully run for office, and then maybe in 2016, recruit and support more young people doing the same thing.”
Before Troiano will officially declare his candidacy, he has set benchmarks for fundraising and support, including raising $25,000 in online contributions and getting 1,000 online signatures of support.
“To me, that’s not only a demonstration of the potential support I would have, but also will allow me to launch an effective campaign,” Troiano said.
Troiano acknowledged, however, that as a young candidate he would not have access to the same set of resources as his older competitors.
“One of the biggest barriers is the money in politics,” Troiano said. “I don’t have as large of a network as someone who is twice my age, nor do the people in my network have as much money as someone twice my age.”
Troiano would also face challenges running as an independent. Since 1949, only six congressmen have been elected to the House of Representatives running as an independent, none of whom are currently in office.
During his time on the Hilltop, Troiano served as a Chair of the Georgetown University Student Association Finance and Appropriations Committee and founded The Can Kicks Back, a bipartisan campaign to lower the national debt; experiences, he said, that prepared him well for his campaign beyond the front gates.
“To me, whether it’s in student government or in school or in life or in work, people have to work with each other to get things done, and you’re not all going to agree with each other all the time to do it, but you put your community first,” Troiano said. “And I think that’s what’s wrong with our national politics, how they’re too busy bickering all the time, and doing nothing for the country.”
Former GUSA Vice President Greg Laverriere, (COL ’12) who worked closely with Troiano on the “Do We Have a Deal Yet?” national campaign to push politicians to compromise on the federal debt limit, commended Troiano’s decision to run.
“I have nothing but the utmost respect for him. When I saw on Facebook that he had decided to run for Congress, I was really excited for him,” Laverriere said. “He was always really committed to the issues and fighting for what was right.”
Former GUSA senator Tim Rosenberger and College Republicans board member (COL ’16) was encouraged by Troiano’s run.
“It’s always wonderful to see recent Georgetown alums getting involved in politics,” Rosenberger said.
Rosenberger, who as a member of College Republicans was aware of Troiano’s involvement in The Can Kicks Back campaign, anticipated that his platform would center on national debt issues.
“I think that’s going to be his primary focus, and he definitely is somebody that knows a great deal about that,” Rosenberger said.

As area universities fall victim to sophisticated cyberattacks, the University Information Security Office at Georgetown remains vigilant in its attempts to combat the 2.4 million attempted intrusions Georgetown’s network faces a day.
“The entire environment of cyberattacks against higher education has just simply changed. No longer sort of this lone wolf creating nuisances or viruses, it really is sophisticated, foreign, government-sponsored and organized crime rings that are now focusing their attention on colleges and universities,” Deputy Chief Information Officer Judd Nicholson said.
While 28.3 percent of the attacks are based domestically, an additional 14 percent come from China and 6.4 percent from Russia, according to Georgetown statistics.
The University of Maryland was the latest school to be targeted, after a cyberattack Wednesday compromised the personal records of more than 300,000 students, faculty and staff on its College Park and Shady Grove campuses. The database holds information dating back to 1998.
The database breached contained names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth and university identification numbers, but no financial, health, academic or contact information.
“I am truly sorry. Computer and data security are a very high priority of our university. … We recently doubled the number of our IT security engineers and analysts. We also doubled our investment in top-end security tools. Obviously, we need to do more and better, and we will,” University of Maryland-College Park President Wallace D. Loh wrote in a press statement Wednesday.
The incident coincided with the recent implementation of mandatory bi-annual password changes for all Georgetown students, faculty and staff. In an email Wednesday, Chief Information Officer Lisa Davis wrote that the change was spurred by “increasingly sophisticated phishing and cyberattacks” on Georgetown and other universities.
“We’re just such attractive targets because we have so much data, so many different kinds. It’s kind of one-stop shopping from the point of view of the hacker,” Associate University Information Security Officer Judith House said.
According to Nicholson, hackers are attracted not only by personal information, but also by research information and potential information about intellectual property. Nicholson believes the recent attack at U-Md. resemble the phishing attacks on Georgetown students, faculty and staff in deliberateness and complexity.
Nicholson emphasized the value of risk management and improved practices and procedures for dealing with more advanced threats in maintaining a “balance between openness and security” at Georgetown. Over the past two years, the university has been mitigating risk through the ongoing monitoring of university systems and networks, regular security reviews, system evaluation and analysis.
“It is about risk management, so we do various things here in UIS to really protect the data of the institution. So, on-going monitoring of our systems and our networks. We do regular security reviews so that we can know where the risks are, and we can then proactively mitigate those. So, I think in this case, understanding the risks and then putting in place the best practices and procedures to protect our environment is really our goal right now,” Nicholson said.
The new bi-annual password has been met with a less than enthusiastic response from students.
Christine Kalpin (SFS ’16) saw the change as a mark of inefficiency on the part of university administration.
“I’ve gotten so many spam things, and I feel like they tell me to change the password so many times, so I feel like they need to increase whatever they’re doing, try better measures of combating this,” Kalpin said.
Nevertheless, administrators expressed confidence in the policy as one way to reduce the risk of attack.
“Every computer and every device is an entry point to our network and the best protection is for us to do the pain-in-the-neck things that are securing our passwords. … I do understand that it’s a nuisance, but we really need you to be our partner on this,” House said.
In response to the breach at U-Md., House also encouraged students not to click on links in emails, share personal information over phone, email or text and to delete texts from unfamiliar numbers or names.

Representative John Dingell (D-Mich.) (C ’49, LAW ’52), the longest-serving congressman in history, announced Monday that he would not seek re-election in the fall amid increasingly severe Congressional partisanship.
Dingell, 87, was no stranger to political life. The congressman was first elected to his seat in 1955, succeeding his late father, John D. Dingell Sr., who had held the seat since 1933. Having served in Congress for 58 consecutive years, Dingell is not only the longest-serving congressman, but also the longest serving dean of the House of Representatives and Michigan congressional delegation, respectively.
Serving under 11 presidencies from Eisenhower through Obama, Dingell never shied away from asserting his position. While the congressman supported fellow Democrat and President Lyndon B. Johnson’s civil rights bills, he opposed amendments to the bill that called for mandatory busing in Detroit. The congressman also made news in April 2006 when, alongside 10 other congressmen, Dingell unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of President George W. Bush’s Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 in U.S. District Court.
The congressman’s ties with Georgetown run deep — he attended Georgetown Preparatory and went on to earn both a bachelor’s degree in chemistry and a Juris Doctor from the university. Georgetown President John J. DeGioia expressed his appreciation for Dingell’s service in a statement Monday.
“Through his decades of public service, and his thoughtful, careful leadership, Congressman Dingell has represented the very best of our Georgetown tradition. His longevity of service is a testament to his extraordinary dedication to his constituents and our nation,” DeGoia said.
The feeling was mutual, as Dingell expressed his appreciation for the values he learned at the university in a 2013 statement to The Hoya.
“Georgetown and the Jesuits gave me a great gift. They taught me about values, how to think and reason, and so much more that has benefitted me throughout my whole life. Simply put, Georgetown helped prepare me to become the man that I am,” Dingell wrote.
During his time in Congress, Dingell served as Chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee and as a strong proponent of gun rights and organized labor. Dingell was noted among colleagues for beginning each Congressional term by presenting the same national health insurance bill that his father had proposed during his tenure.
Entering a Congressional landscape shaped by desegregation and the post-World War II communist scare sweeping Congress, Dingell is one of a number of veteran congressmen leaving the legislature amid cries of increasing partisanship.
“I find serving in the House to be obnoxious. It’s become very hard because of the acrimony and bitterness, both in Congress and in the streets,” Dingell said at a luncheon Monday.
While no challengers to Dingell’s seat have emerged in the day since the congressman’s announcement, eyes are currently trained on former General Motors executive and Dingell’s wife of 38 years, Debbie Dingell.
Dingell’s constituents expressed that the congressman’s experience lent him a profound understanding of the workings of the American political system.
“I think that he was a good congressman because he was so experienced, and the important thing about having experienced congresspersons is that they know how to compromise and they know a lot about how the system works,” University of Chicago student and Ann Arbor, Mich. native Mari Cohen said.
Carolyn Gearig, a freshman at the University of Michigan from Troy, Mich. echoed Cohen’s remarks, noting that Dingell’s lengthy tenure reflected well on his work in Congress.
“It means that we voted in a good guy who obviously did a good enough job for a really long time, so it’s a good thing that shows political stability. It’s also nice to have change and progress in our state leadership,” Gearig said.

Over spring break, four Georgetown University undergraduates and one graduate student will take part in the Atlantic Hope humanitarian disaster simulation in conjunction with the Jesuit University Humanitarian Action Network in Fort Pierce, Fla.
The simulation, which will occur from March 6 through 9 at the Public Safety Training Complex of Indian River State College, provides a hands-on field training experience that models what it is like for responders aiding a crisis zone. The program uses the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program.
In order to find interested students, former simulation participant and Atlantic Hope Staff Development Officer Ariana Tuchman (GRD ’15) approached JUHAN on campus.
Mary Oeftering (SFS ’14), Sophia Berhie (SFS ’14), Taylor Griffin (COL ’14) and Zoe Mowl (SFS ’15) are the four undergraduate JUHAN fellows who will be participating. JUHAN is an initiative through the Center for Social Justice and the Institute for the Study of International Migration that works on improving the education of humanitarian issues and awareness.
“We also coordinate response on campus to humanitarian crises,” Oeftering said. “When the disaster in the Philippines happened last semester, we helped coordinate all of the different offices and clubs that would want to raise money so that we could make one big donation as a university. This is so people are not doubling their efforts where work has already been made.”
Participants will take on the role of aid workers operating in Atlantica, a fictional country modelled after many past conflict zones.
“Atlantica has evolved over the years. It used to be somewhat of a post-Soviet Union state. After the Haitian Earthquake, we worked in pieces simulating it. Now it is kind of taking a Syria tone. It is fictional enough where people cannot always know what they are responding to,” Tuchman said.
Overall, the simulation will involve 39 undergraduates from different areas of the country.
“We have students [who] come in with a variety of backgrounds. Some are nursing students [who] want to work in hospitals in the U.S. and for them it is a good experience to learn how to deal with high-stress environments. Some people are political science students who want to join the Peace Corps. We also have nontraditional students who may be in their 30s and 40s who come,” Tuchman said.
The focus on the leadership part of the program ensures that participants are in control of the situations. The staff members act as controllers and evaluators, but do not directly participate in the program. Their role is to make sure that the participants stay safe and that they are completing the learning objectives.
Many past participants of the program have gone on to aid in humanitarian efforts around the world. One former participant is working in Mali with the World Food Program and another is currently completing conflict resolution work in South Sudan.
“After I participated, I worked in Kenya at an internally displaced persons camp over the summer. It definitely was not nearly as intense as Atlantica,” Tuchman said.“There were a few minor emergencies or potential things that could have happened while in Kenya. I just feel like I had a much better reaction, as I was able to take a deep breath and gain some situational understanding.”
Both the participants anticipate personal growth from the coming experience.
“I am hoping that this simulation will help me determine if I am cut out for humanitarian work. I am definitely nervous — I think it is more that I don’t know what will happen. I think they are intentionally vague so that we aren’t prepared for everything that happens because you are not prepared for everything in a crisis,” Oeftering said.
Participants additionally look forward to the practical insight that the simulation will offer.
“I think the simulation will take me out of my comfort zone, which will be incredibly challenging but also [will be] a growing experience for me. It will give me insight into the structural and practical difficulties [that] humanitarian workers face on the ground. It’s an incredible opportunity to apply the theories and practices I learn about in the classroom to a real, simulated event,” Berhie said.

KRISTEN SKILLMAN/THE HOYALeft to right: Christine Fair, Mark Mazzetti, Naureen Shah, Raha WalaThe U.S. government’s drone use as a means to combat global terrorism was one of the main topics at an event hosted by the Amnesty International Chapters of Georgetown University and Georgetown Law Center on Sunday night in the Intercultural Center Auditorium.
The event, titled “Truth and Lies: A Discussion on Drones,” featured Christine Fair, a professor in the security studies program, Human Rights First Law and Security Program Advocacy Counsel Raha Wala, Amnesty International USA Advocacy Advisor Naureen Shah and Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times correspondent Mark Mazzetti.
Mazzetti won his Pulitzer in 2009 for his reporting on the intensifying violence in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
“If you’re going to have a secret war, a drone is a pretty good weapon for it. Because you can carry out strikes in places that are extremely difficult for journalists, human rights groups, international organizations, government officials to get to and actually do hard accounting,” Mazzetti said.
According to Fair, human rights organizations like Amnesty International rely too heavily on first-hand accounts rather than hard data when it comes to verifying information regarding drone strikes in countries such as Pakistan.
“There’s this incredible tendency to believe everything that the interlocutor is telling human rights organizations, and I understand the interest in doing that. We are living in a low-quality information environment, and the stakes are very high. I’m not saying that they have malice, but this is the problem when agenda-driven research dominates the discussion,” Fair said.
In response, Shah asserted the information gathered by Amnesty International remains credited and is the most reliable data possible in the current environment.
“At the end of the day, human rights investigators are not God, they’re not truth-tellers who can claim to have 100 percent knowledge of any incident. But we do this all of the time all over the world, issuing reports on these matters, and we apply the same evidentiary standards here that we do to every other human rights investigation,” Shah said.
Wala touched on the overall issue of the War on Terror, and the difficulty with fighting a war when it is unclear whom the United States is actually at war with, and what the legal boundaries of drone use are.
“We don’t actually know who we’re at war with and who the laws of war supposedly apply to in these circumstances. Those are the key questions and points of ambiguity that need to be focused on in this debate over drones,” Wala said.
A question and answer session followed the discussion. The session allowed the audience of roughly 50 people, mostly members of the Amnesty International chapters and members of the event co-sponsor clubs International Relations Club and GU College Democrats, to expand on the topic.
Andrew Meshnick (COL ’17) asked the speakers about the status of current due process standards for U.S. citizens targeted by U.S. drone strikes and the ability to file death lawsuits in this situation.
While the panelists agreed that legal action is especially difficult due to the secrecy of the U.S. government, Wala cast suspicion on the legal basis for the strikes considering the need for a warrant for most surveillance operations in the United States on its citizens.
“There’s a weird irony here which is that if you want to target an American overseas for surveillance purposes you actually do need to go to a court and get a certain amount of independent judicial review, and the judges in these cases have noted this irony. So it does feel weird that you can’t really surveil someone without judicial intervention, but apparently you can kill them,” Wala said.
In response to a question about the growth of companies that supply these armed drones,
Mazzetti dispelled the notion that these drone pilots are disconnected from their actions and that these targeting killings have become a way to separate soldiers from the horrors of the battlefield.
“I don’t buy the idea of the joystick-mentality for these pilots, the idea that it’s really easy for everyone because it’s like you’re playing a video game. There is that issue of when you’re carrying out an operation you’re seeing it in pretty good definition, and that does have a psychological impact,” Mazzetti said.
The event is part of the “Drone Awareness Project,” conceived by Bassam Sidiki (COL ’16) who thought of the idea after he heard about a similar project at Tufts University where students sent letters to students at a school in Lahore, Pakistan asking them about how drones have impacted their lives.
“I wanted this to be a way to have a transnational conversation about an issue that is affecting so many people’s lives,” Sidiki said. “A university of Georgetown’s stature has to be at the forefront of the discussion on this issue and explore it from many different angles.”
The series continues this Wednesday, Feb. 26, with a discussion on drones and their impact on international law with government and foreign service professor Anthony Arend.

The D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities recently commissioned its second installation of the public arts exhibition, The 5×5 Project, which will place 25 curated art installations around the District this fall.
The project, which runs from September to December 2014, will feature exhibits from five renowned curators: Lance Fung, Shamim Momin, Stephanie Sherman, Justine Topfer and A.M. Weaver. Each curator will choose works from five artists respectively, culminating in 25 art installations to be placed throughout the District’s eight wards.
“It’s like having a canvas in the community where people can enjoy, experience and have civic pride in their neighborhoods. It really helps to spur civic pride within the neighborhoods of the city,” DCCAH Executive Director Lionell Thomas said.
According to Thomas, the project was initiated in spring 2012 in conjunction with the National Cherry Blossom Festival and has served to further develop art in the District.
“It is part of our overall 10-year master plan, and as a part of that, it was cited that we need to do more public temporary art in order to help expand and develop art in the neighborhoods,” Thomas said, as well as to “bring the art to the residents and visitors of the District of Columbia. That’s why we undertook this project, because it was something that was identified as a need from the community.”
The DCAAH has allotted $500,000 to the project to be split amongst the five curators. Lance Fung, Chief Curator at Fung Collaboratives said that the small budget poses a unique challenge for the project.
“Our projects are typically huge,” Fung said. “Fung Collaboratives and I have done public art exhibitions usually in the multi-million dollar range … What is an asset for doing this project in D.C. and with DCCAH is that they really want it to be intellectual — and they want it to be cutting edge: the most interesting, thought provoking art work that we can do.”
Fung’s project, “Nonuments,” will feature five art monuments based on contemporary themes, such as human trafficking and global warming.
“D.C. is known for its monuments,” Fung said. “There are so many historical monuments and many are beautiful and artistic, but in creating ‘Nonuments,’ I felt it would be interesting to give the artists a chance to create these sculptures that relate to their current passions and concerns and things that may not really get addressed for a monument in current day.”
For fellow 5×5 curator Stephanie Sherman, who will explore disparate visions of the future with her project, “Near Future,” the importance of public art lies in its ability to touch the daily lives of D.C. residents.
“I think the most important thing is that lots of people who aren’t looking for art discover it, [which is a] really different situation than a gallery or museum where people have to want to discover art,” Sherman said. “I think public art is something unexpected, sort of a vision of a landscape that is part of the big landscape that we all have in our daily lives.”
Thomas said he hoped the installations would show off a more cultured side of the District.
“That’s what I want people to see: that Washington D.C. is the vibrant cultural capital of the United States, and that there is a lot of art and culture that is really bustling here,” Thomas said. “Our hope is that we touch the lives of all of our residents and visitors, and that in some way, shape or form everyone is touched by this project and that they are really engaged.”
Soraya Eid (MSB ’17) looked forward to seeing the exhibits in the fall.
“I will definitely go see them,” Eid said.“I really appreciate that the District is taking the initiative to promote art, because D.C. is one of those big cities [where] other than the big museums there’s not much art in the city.”

Ikon.5 architects showcased possible furniture options for the Healey Family Student Center in order to gauge student opinion at an open forum in McShain Lounge on Monday evening.
“The challenge of this project is how to transform New South, which is a pretty banal, very functional building, which can be found on any campus … into a student center that feels like it belongs to the culture of Georgetown,” ikon.5 principal architect Joe Tattoni said.
The firm selected furniture options that will serve functionally in the large multipurpose space,which will be utilized as a social, entertainment, study and meeting space.
“There are conflicting ideas that needed to be expressed in the facility as well as accommodated in the furniture,” architect Alan Coopper said.
The large space will be divided into different furniture groupings. Chairs and ottomans that can be grouped together or used individually will line the wall of windows overlooking the Potomac. The center lounge area of the room will include L-shaped couch units, ottomans and tables. Additionally, two rows of restaurant-like booths will be situated near the entrance of the planned pub.
The furniture options that are under consideration are versatile and movable.
“Flexibility is an important aspect. You need to be able to move things around and change things out. You don’t want it all set in one particular way, because it might need to be something else the next day or the next week,” Coopper said.
At the conclusion of the presentation, students were invited to test samples of the chairs and ottomans under consideration and complete a questionnaire indicating their preferences.
About 10 students attended the forum.
“I think [the furniture] fits the area well. They have a variety. … It’s good to have seating for the students reading [as well as] the students who come with a laptop to do homework that way,” forum attendee David Lizza (COL ’15) said.
Architects also presented two design options for a class giving wall that will be located alongside the set of stairs connecting the ground floor promenade to the first floor lobby.
The first option featured several vertical wooden panels of different heights and widths that ascended with the stairs. Plaques showing class gifts would be overlaid on top of the wood.
“We really wanted to try to bring the wood back into the space to warm the space up a little bit,” architect Chris Hayes said. “The idea was to pick up on the walnut that’s being used throughout the space, as well as provide a little bit of protection on the wall as you’re moving up and down.”
The second option featured a display of horizontal white panels and silver plaques. The sides of the panels, which will be visible when walking up and down the stairs, would be blue, which Hayes said was inspired by the Potomac river.
“As sort of a relief for these plaques, the edges are treated in colors of blue to kind of give you that cascade look to reflect the water on the outside,” Hayes said.
Either option will begin with 21 plaques, with room to add more.
After the presentation, administrators took an informal vote to gauge opinion about which option students favored. Initially, almost all students opted in favor of the white and silver option. After a short discussion during which architects pointed out the possibility of including a design on the panels of either choice and the sustainability of the wooden panels, student opinion was more evenly split.
“I liked the wood just because I see that they’re trying to bring wood throughout the entire space with some of the furniture and accents,” attendee Connor Maytnier (COL ’17) said.
While architects have narrowed down the furniture options for the space, final choices will be informed by student opinion.
“I really like that they are asking people’s opinions because I do think that it really does make a big difference,” HFSC Student Planning Committee member Katie Hughes (COL ’16) said.
The HFSC is scheduled to open in fall 2014.

COURTESY GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITYUniversity President John J. DeGioia congratulated the five John Carroll Award winners in Miami, Fla., Saturday.John Carroll Weekend, the annual celebration for alumni, family and friends of the university, was held in Miami, Fla., from Feb. 20 to 23.
The Georgetown University Alumni Association has sponsored the event since 1952.
“John Carroll Weekend has become an increasingly important and well-attended opportunity for the Georgetown community to come together, to be inspired, engaged and reminded of what makes Georgetown so special,” Alumni Association Executive Director William Reynolds said.
The weekend included four days of events ranging from social activities to academic lectures, covering a wide variety of topics including sustainable energy, sports and Latin American business. Most events were held at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel.
The celebration drew distinguished speakers, well-known faculty members, alumni from all undergraduate and graduate schools and Latin American leaders. Notable speakers included former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former National Football League Commissioner and Chairman of the board of directors Paul Tagliabue (CAS ’62) and National Geographic Emerging Explorer and filmmaker Alexandra Cousteau (COL ’98), a water resource management advocate.
“There was one [event] on creating new models for global education that President DeGioia was a part of,” Kirsten Harmon (COL ’09, LAW ’14) said. “There was a really great luncheon on the role of women and business in Latin America and a really fantastic panel on driving business expansion in Latin America.”
The Latin America Alumni Leadership Summit, now in its fourth year, was held Feb. 20 in Miami as well.
“I think having that [the summit] in conjunction with the John Carroll Weekend added a lot of energy and enthusiasm,” Harmon said. “There were a lot of people came who hadn’t necessarily been to John Carroll Weekend before, myself included.”
Since 1952, John Carroll Weekend has travelled to a different city each year to celebrate the best of Georgetown. The weekend offered participants the opportunity to engage with one another, Georgetown faculty and world leaders, while experiencing a new city.
This year, participants experienced the city of Miami through events like Salsa Night at Bongos Cuban Café and the Food Network’s South Beach Wine & Food Festival, which featured tastings tents of Latin-inspired cuisine. Attendees also got the chance to view the championship trophies of the two-time National Basketball Association champions, the Miami Heat.
“Georgetown really pulls out all the stops,” Thomas Lane III (COL ’14) said.
The main event of the weekend was the John Carroll Awards Banquet, where five alumni and one “friend of the university” were recognized for their involvement and dedication to Georgetown. The alumni association bestows this honor to people who have upheld Georgetown’s mission of excellence, service and leadership.
“They weren’t just being awarded for their individual accomplishments so much as that in addition to that, they continued to remain involved and really serving and giving back to the Georgetown Community,” Harmon said.
This year, alumni Jane Hopkins Carey (CAS ’79), John C. Courtin (CAS ’70, LAW ’78), Robert M. Flanagan (GSB ’67), Joseph L. Guarriello (GSB ’71, LAW ’74) and J. Clifford Hudson (LAW ’80) received the John Carroll Award.
“You got the sense that they really felt they had received a lot from Georgetown and had really committed themselves to giving back as they moved on in their lives so that was definitely really inspiring,” Harmon said.
Irene Ryan Shaw, the mother of three Georgetown graduates, received the 2014 Patrick Healy Award, which is the highest honor bestowed by the alumni association upon distinguished non-alumni for whom the university has a deep respect and admiration.
Following the banquet, a cappella group The Georgetown Chimes sang with past members.
“We’ve got a really strong alumni connection,” Lane, a current Chime, said. “We sang together with these guys for about a half hour so it was really quite a treat.”
While the John Carroll Weekend is mainly meant for alumni, there could be benefits to encouraging more graduate, or even undergraduate, students to attend.
“There are very few undergraduate students, but it’s a really cool event all the same,” Lane said.

ALEXANDER BROWN/THE HOYAWhite House Executive Chef Cristeta Comerford, the first minority and first woman to hold the position, spoke at the East Coast Asian American Student Union Conference’s formal gala at the Grand Hyatt on Saturday.Georgetown University and The George Washington University co-hosted the 2014 East Coast Asian American Student Union Conference from Feb. 21 to 23, marking the first time since the conference’s inaugural event 37 years ago that the conference was hosted by multiple universities in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area.
The panel events, workshops and closing ceremony took place in Georgetown’s Intercultural Center, whereas all other events were held on GWU’s campus.
Since 1977, ECAASU has focused on bringing together college students from the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities.
“As its official mission statements says, the ECAASU works to inspire and educate attendees through invigorating cultural performances, numerous workshops and several opportunities to interact with several other AAPI advocates across the East Coast,” APIAVote Director Christine Chen said.
The conference, which drew over a thousand Asian American students and advocates, began with an address by U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan on Friday evening at GWU’s Charles E. Smith Center. Saturday’s events, also held in Foggy Bottom, consisted of group workshops. The night was capped with a formal gala at the Grand Hyatt, during which White House Executive Chef Cristeta Comerford spoke.
Sunday’s events, held on Georgetown’s campus, were based on leadership and professional development.
The event was mainly focused on employment opportunities and experiences for Asian-Americans in the workplace. Georgetown University hosted over 10 workshops, with counseling mentors from diverse backgrounds.
“We need to change the perceptions of Asian- American professionals by some employers,” professor of public communication at American University Scott Talan said. “Branding yourself in a proper way can make potential employers see beyond your Asian stereotypes—stereotypes that can create a lot of stress for Asian-Americans both on and off the workplace.”
Talan also added how crucial the internet is in promoting one’s image to employers and the need to utilize technology accordingly.
“Our lives are becoming more and more connected to the digital world. We can’t ignore that,” Talan said. “That’s why it is especially important to create the right digital brand presence online, since employers are increasingly searching [for] their employees through the Web.”
Pathways Programs Officer at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Piyachat Terrell, a panelist at the event, similarly noted the importance of self-advertising when looking for federal jobs in particular.
“Federal employment opportunities can be a rare opportunity not only for Asian-Americans, but for anyone in general,” Terrell said. “That’s why you need to market yourself properly, and most importantly, look for niche jobs within the federal agencies that you can market your Asian-American identity best.”
Terrell emphasized using the advantage of being both Asian and American, and also cited a need to be proactive in searching for the ideal job.
“The EPA’s goal, ultimately, is to provide access to federal job opportunities and offer environmental education training,” Terrell added. “But it is ultimately you who need to find the appropriate job that you have a comparative advantage in and take advantage of that.”
The relationships forged during the three-day event last far beyond the conclusion of the conference.
“This conference is a great way to meet other Asian American students and form tight-knit relationships with them,” student organizer Grace Tien said. “We are excited to be organizing this year’s event, and I hope many participants will be able to find other peers with similar interests and goals.”
ECAASU Conference Associate Director Annie Yan (MSB ’14) discussed what she hopes participants learned at the conference.
“Our theme this year was ‘Mission Ignition: Champion your Cause’ because we wanted to create a forum of stereotype-breaking discussion, to form a community, and to get people interested in AAPI issues,” Yan said. “We wanted people to experience the social opportunities at the conference, but we also wanted to inspire passion and an engagement in advocacy that helps Asian students feel free to pursue their professional dreams.”
Georgetown students appreciated the advice and expertise shared at the conference.
“Growing up in Tennessee as an Asian-American wasn’t easy, and many people would often expect me to get perfect math or science scores in my high school,” Daniel Kim (COL ’17) said. “I had a hard time dealing with those stereotypes, but this conference helped me a lot with making a brand out of myself so that I can be seen beyond the expectations people might have about me. It was also amazing to share my experiences at a personal level with other peers with similar concerns.”
Correction: Christine Chen is the APIAVote Director, not a panelist and assistant director of the Office of Minority and Women Inclusion at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The theme was “Mission Ignition: Champion Your Cause,” not “Mission Ignition: Championing Your Cause.”

ALEXANDER BROWN/THE HOYAThe usually bustling Georgetown campus can be eerily quiet in the early morning, but for some students, 4 a.m. is the perfect time to complete their studies.Campus is silent. Most buildings are closed. The majority of students have gone to bed with the exception of a few lit dorm rooms and some studying in main buildings, such as Lauinger Library and the Rafik B. Hariri Building. As Thursday melds into Friday, it is too late for most people to be out and too early for most to be awake. This is 4 a.m. at Georgetown University.
4:05 a.m. The second floor of Lau totals 10 students. The students are broken up in two smaller groups and one individual sits in a cubicle working. Three students congregate around a table, staring blankly at textbooks and giggling nervously. They are all studying for a biochemistry midterm later that day. One of the students, Margaret Horak (NHS ’15), describes her increased stress levels the night before an exam.
“I study up to it, but the night before the exam, I’m up all night. I can’t sleep,” Horak said.
The members of the group, mostly majoring in various sciences, all usually go to sleep around 3 a.m., but because of the test, they are hoping to fill their remaining time with more studying. They chose the library because it keeps them from avoiding distractions or falling asleep.
4:11 a.m. The change of setting is a common practice for other students, too.
Phil Cho (MSB ’14) is on his way to the library because he knows he has something to finish.
“I try MSB and other places but usually end up going to Lau. I can’t really work in my room,” Cho said. He rushes to finish his paper by the morning, before his trip to New York.
4:23 a.m. Asahi Nino (COL ’17) does not often pull all-nighters. He usually stays up all night only a couple of times a month, almost always prompted by writing a paper.
“I feel like there’s a certain point where I realize I’m probably going to be up all night and then I get less productive because I know I’m going to be here forever anyways so I have time to spare,” Nino said. “Then, towards the end, I realize that I really do want to get it done, and my productivity goes up again.”
4:30 a.m. In comparison, Nino’s roommate, Matthijs Van Duijl (MSB ’17), stays up until 4 a.m. every school night. He does not work well during the day and feels most productive around midnight. Like the others, Van Duijl leaves his room to study during the wee hours of the night and sometimes feels like the only one on campus.
“People start to leave around 3 a.m,” he said. “I’m either here alone or there is someone else struggling with me.”
4:38 a.m. Campus is dimly lit and students can no longer enter Regents by swiping. Sellinger Lounge and Hoya Court smell of cleaning products and are completely devoid of students, with only the presence of custodial staff.
4:45 a.m. Another student sits writing a paper, but a bit closer to home. Massimo Mazzolini (COL ’17) usually stays in his room, but he decided to work in his common room, tonight. He yawns a few times and comments on his lack of productivity at the moment. Typically, he feels most productive at midnight, but works straight through the night.
“I don’t want to risk not waking up, so I stay up until I finish,” Mazzolini said.
While some students slumber, other students study. This is 4 a.m. at Georgetown University.
