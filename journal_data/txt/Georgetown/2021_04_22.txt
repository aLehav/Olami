The Georgetown University Student Association finalized the student activities budget for the 2021-22 fiscal year, increasing funding for the Student Activities Commission and making cuts to Lecture Fund.
The GUSA Senate Finance & Appropriations Committee, made up of 12 senators, made cuts to the Campus Ministry Student Forum, the Center for Social Justice, Georgetown Program Board and Lecture Fund. Lecture Fund received the highest cut, with a decrease of 20% from FY20-21. The committee allocated more funding to SAC, the Advisory Board for Club Sports, Media Board, Georgetown Opportunities for Leadership Development, Outdoor Education, the Performing Arts Advisory Committee and GUSA. GUSA received the highest funding raise, with an increase of 43.36% from last year.
FinApp allocated just over $1.09 million collected from this year’s Student Activities Fee, a semesterly fee all students pay that covers the cost of student activities. The initial budgeting process began when each of the 12 student organizations presented their budget requests to FinApp. In the following weeks, FinApp released their preliminary budget, and then the advisory board entered an appeals process. The final budget reflects post-appeals changes. 
This year’s budget allocation process was much more congenial than in past years, according to GUSA FinApp Chair James Winston Ardoin (SFS ’21). Last year, some senators raised concerns about allocating more funding to certain Part A applicants, which include the advisory boards and student organizations who can present to FinApp in order to receive funding.
“Compared to past years there wasn’t necessarily the same level of animosity towards any one of the Part A applicants,” Ardoin said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “A big part of that being that over half of our committee was first-time FinApp members and first-year students who just hadn’t been on campus to see how a lot of these organizations have existed in the past or what previous controversies have been.”
SAC, which received a 4.27% increase in funding from last year’s allocation, serves as the advisory board for the majority of Georgetown’s student clubs, funding roughly 125 member organizations. In March 2020, the FinApp committee cut SAC funding by 16.8%, prompting backlash from many member organizations. Later that month, the committee allocated more funding to SAC, transferring $43,500 of the initial $51,048 that was cut back to the organization. 
While SAC received more funding for the 2021-22 fiscal year, the organization will still have to cut funding for its member organizations as it divides up monies, according to SAC Chair Matthew Failor (SFS ’23).
“SAC has no choice but to pass our budget cuts onto clubs to ensure we have sufficient money to fulfill ad hoc requests throughout the year as well as fund budgets in the spring,” Failor wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Thus, we’re imposing a 7% cut to [proposed] Fall budgets across the board.”
Leaders from Lecture Fund, a student organization that arranges forums and brings speakers to campus for these events, are also concerned about this year’s budget cuts. Many GUSA FinApp members believed Lecture Fund could make do with less funding by holding many speaker events virtually next year, according to Ardoin. However, speaker fees typically range from $6,000 to $15,000 and have not significantly decreased, even for virtual events, according to Lecture Fund Vice Chair of Finance Deena Bhatt (MSB ’23). 
“The budget cut has a very direct effect on students because it means we won’t be able to host, as well as co-sponsor, as many events,” Bhatt wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Overall, any cut to our funding directly hinders our ability to carry out our organization’s mission of sparking meaningful dialogue on campus and ‘enriching the academic experience of the Georgetown community.’” 
Lecture Fund also allocates funding to 14 other campus organizations. This year’s budget cuts will also cut the funding Lecture Fund can offer to other student groups, according to Bhatt.
“While we understand the limitations we’ve incurred, and may continue to incur, as a result of the pandemic, we hope we can soon get back to a point where our budget is truly reflective of our organization’s needs,” Bhatt wrote.
In addition to funding separate student organizations, the GUSA FinApp committee also decides how much to allocate to GUSA itself, which Ardoin noted students often see as a conflict of interest, although FinApp always tries to be unbiased when funding GUSA, according to Ardoin. 
“The conversation was very bizarre,” Ardoin said of the FinApp meetings on GUSA’s allocation this year. “There’s obviously a recognition that there’s a bit of a conflict of interest, in that we fund all of these other organizations but we also fund ourselves, and trying to think more critically about what GUSA’s funding means and how to be as objective as possible.” 
In 2019, the FinApp committee cut GUSA’s budget by a significantly large amount, with GUSA only receiving 11% of the funds they requested; GUSA was only allocated $1,735 from FinApp, a small portion of the $26,760 requested that year by former GUSA executives Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20) and Aleida Olvera (COL ’20).
Despite controversy, much of GUSA’s funding goes to other student advocacy groups in the form of assistance funds, which can make the process confusing, since some of these advocacy groups already receive funds from SAC, according to Ardoin.
Some club leaders are also concerned about what the FinApp process will look like after some proposed structural reforms within GUSA. GUSA Senate Speaker Melanie Cruz-Morales (COL ’22) has promised to restructure the GUSA Senate by removing unnecessary hierarchies and titles, which may include restructuring certain GUSA committees such as FinApp in coming years. GUSA President Nile Blass (COL ’22) and Vice President Nicole Sanchez (SFS ’22) have also pushed for GUSA to focus more on student advocacy, and some have suggested abolishing the GUSA Senate altogether. 
While some club leaders support the initiative to center GUSA more around student advocacy, many are also worried this could negatively impact the clubs who receive their funding from FinApp, according to Failor.
“The campus-wide push to abolish the senate and replace it with an advocacy-based student union is an incredible idea and one with the best of intentions, but I worry about what it will mean for pretty much every student on campus if the finapp process is left behind,” Failor wrote.

The Georgetown University Student Association Senate unanimously passed a resolution demanding more university resources for Indigenous students at a meeting held April 11.
The resolution calls on the university to hire more Indigenous faculty, create an Indigenous studies major or minor and establish a designated space for Indigenous students to foster community, among other demands. GUSA Senate Speaker Melanie Cruz-Morales (COL ’22), who is an Indigenous student with past experience advocating for Indigenous rights and the Latinx community, wrote the resolution with her twin sister, GUSA Senator Sheila Cruz-Morales (COL ’22). 
Indigenous students only make up approximately 0.1% of the Georgetown student body, reflecting the lack of academic and cultural resources given to Indigenous students by the university, according to Melanie Cruz-Morales.
“Looking at the Indigenous community, there’s absolutely nothing that they’re giving us — no type of guidance, no type of care for Indigenous students,” Melanie Cruz-Morales said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
GUSA has previously had a poor relationship with the Native American Student Council, a student group that advocates for the Indigenous community at Georgetown, due to what NASC perceived to be past performative statements by GUSA, according to Sheila Cruz-Morales. 
As the only Indigenous members of the GUSA Senate, Sheila and Melanie Cruz-Morales felt compelled to pass a resolution that centered the voices of the Indigenous community at Georgetown, according to Sheila Cruz-Morales. 
“We felt the responsibility to do something and speak up about it, despite GUSA having a previous shaky relationship with NASC and with doing a lot of performative work that talked about Indigenous students,” Sheila Cruz-Morales said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
NASC supports the resolution, which is similar to its own 2019 petition to the university to provide Indigenous students with more resources, according to a statement from NASC.
“This is the first step to address the crisis of apathy that Native students and communities experience on this campus daily,” the NASC wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We urge the University to collaborate with GUSA and NASC to obtain the full inclusion and respect that Indigenous students have always deserved.”
NASC’s petition proposed the creation of a Program Coordinator for Indigenous students and also called for a dedicated cultural sanctuary for Indigenous students, the establishment of a Native studies major or minor and demanded that the university hire more Indigenous faculty. As of now, the university has not officially responded to the petition. 
In their resolution, Melanie and Sheila Cruz-Morales also aim to push the university to adopt policies that would make it eligible to partner with College Horizons, a program that supports Indigenous students in higher education. More than 40 universities have partnered with College Horizons, including Harvard University and Stanford University, to ensure that they meet the educational, financial and cultural needs of their Indigenous students.
While many other colleges have designated resources for their Indigenous students, Georgetown has yet to make significant strides toward fostering a more inclusive environment, according to Sheila Cruz-Morales.
“Even just for me and my sister, coming to this university has been difficult because of the lack of resources, the lack of space that there is for Indigenous students,” Sheila Cruz-Morales said. “If we want to bring more Indigenous students here, we have to make sure that this is a good, safe environment for Indigenous students to be in.”
Additionally, the creation of an Indigenous studies major or minor is crucial to support the Indigeous community, according to Melanie Cruz-Morales.
Georgetown currently has limited classes centered around Indigenous studies and only two Indigenous faculty members, which has created a lack of opportunity for Indigenous students to learn about their identity and has limited the worldview of non-Indigenous students, according to Melanie Cruz-Morales.
“Not only is that failing Indigenous communities in itself, but it is failing everyone because it is denying students the opportunity to learn about Indigenous people and the actual constant violence that Indigenous people face even in today’s age,” Melanie Cruz-Morales said.
GUSA has recently pushed for similar initiatives, such as the creation of a Latino studies minor program and the establishment of an Asian American studies program. Both of these initiatives, along with the push for an Indigenous studies program, have been brought up by various students and student groups over the past several years.
Georgetown University’s Indigenous Studies Working Group, which is composed of students, faculty and supporters from both the Georgetown community and the greater Washington, D.C. area, continues to provide resources to students and faculty interested in pursuing Indigenous histories, politics and cultures, according to a university spokesperson. 
“The University is open to exploring programming, and course options that share our diversity, equity and inclusion values, and reflect the broad interests of our students,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The resolution also calls on Georgetown to acknowledge its occupation of Indigenous land. The university’s campus sits on land originally belonging to the Piscataway and the Nacotchtank, Indigenous tribes that held land in the Washington D.C. area in the 17th century. Some members of the Piscataway tribe still reside in the D.C. area today. 
The university should work to establish a relationship with local tribal communities, many of which already have a relationship with NASC, according to Melanie Cruz-Morales.
“You see the relationship between the oppressor and the oppressed all the way back from the creation and establishment of Georgetown until today’s age, where Georgetown currently continues to sit on stolen land yet continues to deny accessibility to Indigenous students at its own institution,” Melanie Cruz-Morales said.
The university is open to working with local tribes in the D.C. area, according to the spokesperson.
“We deeply respect and are open to engaging with the Piscataway tribe, whose ancestral lands include the District of Columbia,” the spokesperson wrote.
Ultimately, Georgetown must acknowledge its past treatment toward Indigenous people and work to better support its Indigenous students, according to Sheila Cruz-Morales. 
“Georgetown being a white elitist institution that has reaped the benefits of Indigenous lands and only continues to create more damage to Indigenous people, Indigenious students, as a whole,” Sheila Cruz-Morales said. “It is the school’s responsibility as Jesuits, as people with power, to really try to come to terms with their past and try to do better for the future.”

Students are pushing for Georgetown University to establish a metro pass program, which would allow students to ride Washington, D.C. public transportation at a discounted price.
The Georgetown University Student Association published a referendum calling on the university to adopt a University Pass program, which provides access to Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority services to students at participating colleges and universities. American University is currently the only D.C. institution of higher learning to offer the U-Pass program to its students; other participants are universities outside of the District with satellite campuses. 
Georgetown’s campus is separated from downtown D.C., causing students to feel separated from the rest of the District, according to GUSA Senator Lara Santana (SFS ’24). 
“I’m a freshman, so I just went through the whole thing where they present the whole university to you, try to make you fall in love, so you decide to commit. Downtown is not as accessible as it could be,” Santana said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “Obviously, there is the Georgetown transportation, but it only goes so far and to specific places. So it really does make it difficult to commute, especially when there are all these internship opportunities. Even if you wanted to enjoy the D.C. scenery, which is something that they advocate in general, it is not as easily available for students.”
Under the program, each full-time student would have access to unlimited rides on both the Metrobus and Metrorail services throughout the entire semester. In the first year after WMATA began offering the program to D.C. universities in 2018, American University students used a total of 1.5 million Metro rides, giving students more cost-effective travel options for internships, jobs and personal activities.
The GUSA Senate voted unanimously April 11 in favor of implementing a U-Pass program for Georgetown’s main campus students. The undergraduate student body will be able to vote on this referendum during GUSA Senate elections, according to Senator Leo Rassieur (COL ’22), who first introduced the referendum to the senate.
Similar to AU’s program, GUSA proposes the U-Pass cost would be automatically included in student tuition, amounting to roughly $136 per semester. Students who receive financial aid would have a reduced or eliminated fee, depending on the student’s financial aid eligibility, according to the referendum.
GUSA hopes to emphasize to the student body that students on financial aid will not have any additional cost if the referendum is adopted, according to Rassieur. 
“Because the cost is factored into tuition, any student who currently receives financial aid will benefit from that financial aid from this program as well,” Rassieur said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “The whole idea is to help lower-income students. That’s where the impetus behind this project comes from. So we wouldn’t be doing this if we thought this would put a burden on lower-income students who have to pay some or part of this fee.” 
Despite financial aid, the current referendum does not allow students to opt out, which may be one of the administration’s main concerns if students vote to implement the program, according to Senator Rowlie Flores (COL ’22), who co-sponsored the referendum. 
“About half of the students do qualify for financial aid and the other half do not, so there will be a big disparity,” Flores said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “So there might be a bit of a tension between students on financial aid and those who are not. So maybe an opt-out option is something that Georgetown needs.”
While the university has not offered a U-Pass program in the past because it would require an increase in tuition, it is working with students to explore the option of implementing one, according to a university spokesperson.
“We are always looking for creative ways to provide our students with transportation options while safeguarding against increases to the cost of attendance,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We continue to explore new opportunities to connect our campus community to the city via free or low-cost modes of transportation.”
If approved, GUSA projects the U-Pass program would officially begin by the 2022-23 academic school year. Full implementation would follow a trial period during the 2021-22 academic year, which would allow select students to test the program. The data that the university collects from this trial period will be used to gauge student interest in U-Passes, according to Flores. 
“Other officers might have different opinions on this, so if this does pass, this is my idea that I would bring up to the university: that the trial period is more like you can decide if you want to partake in the program for at least a semester,” Flores said. “In my opinion, it should be the same logistics that we have in the referendum, but the only difference is that students can decide if they want to try it out.”
GUSA has not yet directly communicated with WMATA to implement this program at Georgetown and will not reach out until both the student body and administration officially approve the program, according to Flores. 
The push for a metro pass program is not entirely new at Georgetown, but an effort to measure student support of the initiative will bolster the advocacy efforts, according to Rassieur. 
“When we talk to administrators about any kind of big project, their question is, ‘How do you know students actually want this? How do you know this isn’t just you or some small vocal minority?’” Rassieur said. “Which is why we need the referendum, because it completely dispels the myth that this is just a handful of people who want this, when in fact it’s the majority of the school.”

I studied undergrad ad american university where they had the UPass program and it was. A MAKE OR BREAK FACTOR THT GREATLY ENHANCED MY DC EXPERIENCE!!! Imagine going anywhere you want anytime on the metro rail or bus without having to consider the fare price. THAT WAS AWESOME. This will greatly benefit students who decide not to travel to a place (even as simple as going grocery shopping) due to stressing over travel fares.

The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has announced its schedule for the 2021-22 season, following a year of canceled shows in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The season, which will run from Oct. 2021 to Sept. 2022, will include a wide variety of shows, bookended by two Tony-Award-winning musicals, starting with “Hadestown” and concluding with “Dear Evan Hansen.” This announcement comes after the Center canceled hundreds of performances and events because of COVID-19 safety restrictions. The upcoming season will also include programming for the Center’s 50th anniversary.
The upcoming season offers something for everyone with its long lineup of shows, according to Jeffrey Finn, vice president of theater producing and programming at the Kennedy Center.
“I am elated to announce what is perhaps one of our most important theater seasons ever at the Kennedy Center as we return with such a full, exciting program of musicals and plays,” Finn wrote in a press release. “The anticipation of being able to see Broadway productions again — and be in the theater together — is palpable.”
Many of the shows lined up for the new season have previously been performed at the Kennedy Center. These performances include the musicals “Ain’t Too Proud—The Life and Times of The Temptations” in 2018 and “The Band’s Visit” in 2019,  both of which sold out during their runs. The smash-hit show “Hamilton” will also return to the Kennedy Center in July 2021 for a 12-week run. 
Some shows will make their Kennedy Center debut this season as well, with the musical “The Prom” set to perform in January 2022 and the band Blue Man Group set to perform in July 2022. 
The announcement represents hope and recovery, according to Robynn Stilwell, associate professor of music at Georgetown University.
“I think all of us are hopeful, and planning for next year is a necessary step. It’s easier (if perhaps more painful) to cancel than to try and scramble to make plans if things open up at the last minute,” Stilwell wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I think it’s, all-in-all, a hopeful step that many in the arts are making, including Georgetown.”
The Center will also celebrate its 50th anniversary during the upcoming season, which includes plans for a new cultural leadership initiative, four artist residencies and numerous new works, among other celebratory efforts. To begin the season in Sept. 2021, the Center will offer two weekends of performances and activities on the REACH campus, a recent expansion of the Kennedy Center overlooking the Potomac River.
As the Kennedy Center launches its reopening, Georgetown students remain hungry for this same opportunity to celebrate performance, according to Maya Roth, director of theater and performance studies at Georgetown and artistic director of the Davis Center for Performing Arts.
“Already we’ve got some projects envisioned that are collaborations and co-productions. Folks want to work together and seize new ways of working, relish and leverage some of the reimagining we’ve been doing in all kinds of ways,” Roth wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The field — and Georgetown arts — will be different. And, I know, grand, next year.”
Despite health and financial hurdles, the Center hopes to provide a season intertwined with the Center’s history, according to Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter.
“I can think of no better way to reemerge from the darkness of these last many months than to reopen with a vibrant, season-long celebration of the Center’s rich history and the bright future of the arts in our nation,” Rutter wrote in a press release.

Universities have a responsibility to increase the representation of Asian American narratives, scholarship and faculty in academia, panelists said at an event held on April 16. 
The virtual event, titled “Anti-Asian Racism: How Do We Move Forward?” was organized by the Edmund J. Walsh School of Foreign Service’s Asian Studies Program, the Office of the Vice President for Global Engagement, the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action and the Georgetown Medical School Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion following a recent surge in anti-Asian hate crimes in the United States. The panelists discussed the importance of Asian American Studies programs and the inclusion of Asian American narratives into broader university curricula. 
Asian Americans have historically been excluded from academic scholarship in the United States, according to Jenny Xu (COL ’21), the inaugural chair of the D.C. College Democrats AAPI caucus. Schools such as Georgetown University must expand the diversity of Asian scholarship and literature to not remain complicit in perpetuating Asian American erasure, Xu said.
“We know that there is strength in diversity, but there is an even greater strength to be found in integrating this diversity into our curriculum and by extension our institutional culture,” Xu said at the event. “We need courses in all fields to incorporate literature from Asian American scholars to establish norms of including Asian Americans in discussions of race beyond binary understandings, and we need to shake ourselves of complicity in Asian American invisibility.”
Currently, only 25 U.S. universities and colleges offer degrees in Asian American Studies. Georgetown does not offer an Asian American studies major, minor or certificate. In February 2019, the Georgetown Asian American Student Association and Georgetown Asian and Pacific Islander Leadership Forum, two student-run affinity groups, launched a photo campaign called “Georgetown Doesn’t Teach Me” to push for an increase in Asian American focused curriculum. 
The lack of Asian American stories in U.S. history curricula perpetuates the stereotype of Asian Americans as an invisible model minority, according to Beth Lew-Williams, associate professor in the Department of History at Princeton University.
“It also matters what is not being taught. I think, in particular, I would highlight that we have to remember that absences in our classroom also teach our students,” Lew-Williams said. “I’ll pick on my own field, if we teach U.S. history, for example, without Asian Americans as historical actors in this narrative, the absence alone I think is teaching our students lessons, and not the lessons that we want to teach.” 
The concept of Asian Americans as the “model minority” first arose in the 1950s and 1960s, when American media favorably portrayed Asians as “good minorities” who successfully overcame discrimination and assimilated to American culture, as opposed to other people of color who were treated as “problem minorities.”
The model minority myth can also place unrealistic expectations on Asian students to always be successful, and as a result, Asian students are often reluctant to seek help from university resources, David L. Eng, a professor of English and American Studies at the University of Pennsylvania said. Eng cited a Mental Health America report that found Asian Americans were three times less likely to seek mental health services than their white counterparts. 
While universities have become more diverse, they still do not provide adequate mental health resources for Asian students who have to deal with the burdens of racism, according to Eng.
“Asian racism, and hate crimes in general, will not go away without proper education and counseling,” Eng said. “The space of the university today may be more diverse, but is it any less segregated?”
Other panelists at the event included Anges Lee (SFS ’17, LAW ’22) editor-in-chief of the Georgetown Law Review, Karthick Ramakrishnan, a professor in the School of Public Policy at University of California, Riverside and founder of AAPI Data, which publishes demographic data and policy research on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and Marita Etcubañez, the senior director of strategic initiatives for Asian Americans Advancing Justice, which seeks to advance the civil rights of Asian Americans through litigation, education and public policy advocacy. 
Both in and out of the university setting, narratives of Asian racism are often oversimplified to become more easily digestible, according to Ramakrishnan. The media tends to focus only on instances of hate against women and the elderly, Ramakrishnan said.
“The reason why all of this is important is not to diminish the individual examples that we see seemingly on endless loop, but to not have this misleading notion that young people are not affected, that the native born are not affected, that men are not affected,” Ramakrishnan said. “They are not reporting it, not even to these community hotlines, suggests that we need to do a far better job at trying to understand the issue and knowing how to take corrective action.”
Hate crimes against Asians surged by nearly 150% in major U.S. cities in 2020 according to a report by Stop AAPI Hate, even as overall hate crimes fell by 7%. Women were 2.5 times more likely to be targeted than men and 7.3% of reported cases came from victims over 60 years old. However, youth under 20 years old were also disproportionately attacked, making up 13.6% of incidents.
Ultimately, Asian hate is not an isolated problem, so there is an obligation to take action, according to Lew-Williams. 
“We can go to all of our communities, and one of the communities here is Georgetown University, but also the smaller communities matter, and the bigger communities matter,” Lew- Williams said. “I think that each of us are members of these communities and we can demand that people not only denounce this hate, but also have very specific proactive steps that they are going to take in response.”

In 2017, at the age of 63, Mélisande Short-Colomb began unpacking her belongings into the Copley Hall suite that would become her home for the next two years. Looking out of her dorm room window, she had a clear view of the Jesuit Community Cemetery on Georgetown University’s campus. 
Buried in the graveyard is Fr. Thomas Mulledy, S.J., who authorized the sale of 314 enslaved people to a Louisiana plantation in 1838 while serving as the provincial of the Maryland Jesuits, and he later served as Georgetown University’s president. Among the 314 people sold were Abraham Mahoney and Mary Ellen Queen, two of Short-Colomb’s direct ancestors. 
Short-Colomb came to Georgetown as a student to share the story of how her ancestors were sold to fund the university, sent to Louisiana and left to be forgotten from history. After four years at Georgetown, two of which were spent as a student, her journey has led her to a one-person, autobiographical performance titled “Here I Am,” which is a personal interrogation of the university’s institutional mythologies surrounding the sale of the group now known as the GU272, according to Short-Colomb. 
“Everything about my relationship with Georgetown is formed around the reality that my family and other families like mine were the involuntary founders of the institution,” Short-Colomb said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “My coming to Georgetown has never been as an 18-to-22-year mindset, coming to Georgetown to voluntarily get something from the institution. I personally came to bring something to the institution that has been lacking in institutional memory since 1789.”
The play, which premiered virtually on YouTube on April 15, is based on a script Short-Colomb wrote over the course of 18 months. Since the premiere, Short-Colomb has virtually performed “Here I Am” live from her apartment in Washington, D.C. four times, including one preview performance and three formal shows, to a global audience. 
“‘We’re all walking on somebody’s grave.’ My father always said that,” Short-Colomb said in the script for her play during a live preview April 13. “So, I got to stand up and look down on Mulledy, on all of their graves, on the graves of the men who thought it was a good idea, the men who thought it was a good idea to enslave and sell my family. I’m back. You thought you were going to get rid of us, you could write us out of history, out of value, out of importance, out of existence. You were wrong.”
Short-Colomb wrote and performed “Here I Am” with support and funding from Georgetown University’s Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics, a joint initiative founded in 2012 between the School of Foreign Service and Georgetown College that aims to use the power of performance to humanize global politics. 
“Here I Am” is a living, breathing example of The Lab’s mission, especially with the goal of creating a space for the creation of original productions that engage with current issues through the emotions of performance, according to Cynthia Schneider, one of The Lab’s co-founders. 
“I believe that this performance, this personal story, which is in so many ways a global story, can touch people in a way that something purely political cannot and hopefully can then provoke a reconsideration, can provoke deep conversations and real reflection on the legacy of slavery — both at Georgetown and in the United States generally,” Schneider said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
Though Short-Colomb arrived at the university ready to share her ancestors’ stories in an effort to redefine the legacy of Georgetown’s founding, “Here I Am” did not first take form until she registered for the course “Performance, Memory and Witness.”
The course, taught by co-director of The Lab and professor of theater and performance studies Derek Goldman, allows students to develop the skills necessary to perform personal and biographical stories that engage with memory as a living force, according to Goldman. 
Goldman can draw a straight line from the stories Short-Colomb shared in his class to the development of “Here I Am,” he said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. 
“It was those early moments where she would bring in things that were handwritten on her yellow pad and share them with that relatively small group of students, and people were just kind of holding their breath with the kind of power of what she was carrying,” Goldman said. 
For Short-Colomb, though she had never starred in her own play before, transitioning her story to the stage felt like just another way to share a story she knew people needed to hear. 
“I was born for the stage, and that is how I have lived my life,” she said. “The whole world is a stage, and we are all daily choosing the part we play. So I wrote a script, and I did a project. That is what ‘Here I Am’ means.”
In 2019, after two years of taking classes, Short-Colomb transitioned from full-time student to working for The Lab, as being a college student with limited resources was difficult. Working for The Lab was a way to maintain a relationship with the university even though she was not taking classes, according to Short-Colomb. 
While Short-Colomb was working with The Lab in 2019, Georgetown university students voted overwhelmingly in favor of adding a $27.20 semesterly fee in students’ bills to create a fund that would be distributed to descendants. Later that year, however, university officials announced Georgetown would instead create its own fund for descendants and contribute $400,000 annually to the fund to help support community-based projects to benefit the descendant community. The university’s decision to act separately from the student referendum prompted community backlash. 
Last month, the university announced an additional foundation, titled the Descendants Truth & Reconciliation Foundation, which was a collaboration between university administrators, GU272 descendant leaders and leaders from the Jesuit community. While the foundation’s goal is to fund racial healing programs and award scholarships to descendants of the GU272, many descendants have raised concerns about the foundation’s creation and goals.
As much as “Here I Am” is a personal testimony, the show is also meant to recognize and remember the Georgetown student activism that created the GU272 referendum, according to Short-Colomb. 
“We have a convoluted history that has been told by enslavers always,” she said. “The referendum was about creating institutional memory in the foundation of Georgetown students’ undergraduate education. To say that it happened before you got here is an abdication of responsibility because it’s happening now.”
