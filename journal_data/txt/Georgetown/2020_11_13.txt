Growing up, Israa Al-Kamali (SFS-Q ’17) dreamed of being a writer. But the more she wrote, the more she realized how much better the stories she wanted to tell would work as movies. She could imagine the camera, the soundtrack and the score as she wrote. Filmmaking and scriptwriting felt like a natural fit. 
As Al-Kamali, who was born in Iraq and has spent the last 20 years living in Qatar, turned her focus to filmmaking, she started to notice how her own story as an Iraqi was missing from the canon. 
If Iraqis do appear on screen, they fall victim to racist stereotyping as terrorists or untrustworthy criminals, according to Al-Kamali.
“They’re represented as terrorists, as people to be suspicious of, to kill,” Al-Kamali said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “So much has been going on in the country and I didn’t understand why our stories were not being told.” 
So when Al-Kamali’s friend and fellow Iraqi creator Ahmed Habib reached out in March to ask if she would be interested in starting an independent film festival in Iraq, Al-Kamali did not hesitate to join. 
For five months, Al-Kamali worked with a volunteer team of three other Iraqi creatives to launch the International Iraqi Film Festival, which is dedicated to showcasing films from and about Iraq. Over the course of eight days in August, the festival’s first event virtually screened 13 short and feature films free of charge for viewers around the world. 
Despite limited funding or access to paid advertising, the team drew between 200 and 300 viewers per screening by advertising on social media and through word-of-mouth, Al-Kamali said. 
“I wasn’t just proud of us as a team, I was proud of the Iraqi community who spread the word, who came and showed up, the people who still have hope for a better Iraq,” Al-Kamali said. “And that’s exactly what we want to do, is we want to continue building and creating and we don’t want to fall in this is hole of despair and we don’t want to give up.”
The IIFF was entirely organized during global shutdowns because of the COVID-19 pandemic, so no in-person screenings were held. However, the festival’s entirely online presence allowed for it to become a more inclusive space with viewers attending from across the world, according to Al-Kamali. 
As the festival organizers think about the future of the IIFF both for the second edition next year and in a post-pandemic climate, maintaining the inclusivity that online screenings create is important, according to Habib. 
“We will definitely continue to show the films online,” Habib said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I think we’re a part of an emerging trend of festivals post-pandemic where showing films online not only enables organizers to show films in a safe manner but also allows us to reach out to audiences globally, which in the past was not possible.”
For Habib, the success of the festival signified not only the desire among the Iraqi community for a platform dedicated to sharing Iraqi culture but also the importance of grassroots social organizing, he said. 
“I think that the festival was a real testament to the ability of community organizers to create something that competes with well-funded initiatives,” Habib said. “It’s a really cool example of how people can reclaim narratives and how people can share art and beautiful expressions of identity.” 
While much of the festival was dedicated to sharing films representing a multitude of Iraqi experiences, whether that be regional, cultural or linguistic diversity, organizers wanted to stress the challenges Iraqi creatives still face in producing their work, according to Al-Kamali. 
To do that, the festival’s team chose to screen “Iraq: War, Love, God and Madness,” a documentary about director Mohamad Al Daradjii’s return from the Netherlands to Iraq in 2004 and his subsequent experience struggling to create a feature film about his home, as their first film. 
Like Daradjii, who was imprisoned and lost crucial crew members during his filming process, Iraqi creatives face unique challenges in access to funding, support and equipment that filmmakers in other countries do not, according to Al-Kamali. 
“It was a really important first film to show because we wanted to tell the audience that, you know, while watching the rest of the films in this program, keep in mind how difficult it is to make films in Iraq or as an Iraqi,” Al-Kamali said. “When critiquing those films, it’s important to keep that in mind. You can’t expect the same things from other filmmakers in other parts of the world.” 
In December, Al-Kamali is set to move to Los Angeles, where she will continue her work at the New York Film Academy after taking classes online this fall. 
Outside of the IIFF, Al-Kamali hopes her own film career can increase and improve the representation of Iraqis in the film industry, she said. 
“I really believe that film can either protect a culture or destroy a culture,” Al-Kamali said. “We have seen how films can be racist, how they can be negatively presenting a certain race or community, a certain group of religious beliefs, and so what’s important for me is I try to tell more stories from our experiences.”
Iraqi creatives are responsible for ensuring that the history of their people does not disappear with aging generations, according to Al-Kamali. 
“People come and go and we don’t know their stories,” Al-Kamali said. “And of course I don’t want my sole focus to be on the tragedies and the misery, we have enough of that. We have enough of it being put on TV or in cinema. There is much more to Iraqis than that.”

Georgetown University announced a new 15-year Power Purchase Agreement under which the university will source two-thirds of its energy needs through energy produced by solar panels, marking the first time the university has ever sourced energy directly from off-site solar facilities.
The agreement will allow the university to purchase 100,000 megawatt-hours of power annually from 11 plants located in Maryland and New Jersey, according to an Oct. 29 news release. In the news release, Chief Operating Officer Geoff Chatas said the transition to this PPA will lower the university’s operating costs. 
Peter Marra, a professor of biology and the environment and director of the Georgetown Environment Initiative, said he is pleased with the steps the university has taken to become more sustainable and believes the administration is serious about sustainability efforts. 
“I am very happy with what Georgetown has been doing. The COO, the Office of Sustainability, and the GEI are all committed to a green Georgetown and reducing our environmental footprint. Divesting from fossil fuels and sourcing power from solar are just the beginning,” Marra wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I think in the coming years the Georgetown community will be surprised at how seriously the administration is taking our environmental challenges.”
Before the agreement, the university had purchased Renewable Energy Certificates for 100% of electricity needs since 2013. RECs show that the university owns a megawatt of renewable energy even if the energy used by the entity technically came from fossil fuels. Under the new PPA, the university will source energy directly from the renewable facilities.
In 2019, the university originally planned to construct a solar panel plant located in rural Maryland, which would have required destroying trees on 210 acres of land. However, environmental activists voiced their opposition, and the university reversed course. Under its new plan, Georgetown will instead purchase electricity from solar plants while continuing to purchase RECs to ensure that all of its electricity is 100% renewable.
Sourcing power from solar panels follows other recent efforts made by Georgetown toward sustainability. Notably, the university was named the top renewable energy college campus in a national ranking Aug. 19 for its recent sustainability initiatives. 
Additionally, the university committed in February 2020 to divest from fossil fuels over a 10-year period and has installed 800,000 square feet of LEED-certified buildings on campus. The university has also improved environmental studies on campus with a new environmental studies minor, a new Certificate in Sustainable Business and new courses on climate change through the Core Pathways program.
Student activism – including the creation of the student-run campaign GU Fossil Free that pushed and passed a studentwide referendum asking for the university to divest from fossil fuels in February – has played a large role in advancing the university’s commitment to sustainability.
The student-led Green Renewable Energy and Environmental Network expressed appreciation that students were invited by the administration to participate in the process of forging the new agreement in the university’s Oct. 19 news release.
Victoria Boatwright (COL ’22), president of GREEN, said the new contract can set a precedent for students and administrators to collaborate on future sustainability projects.
“Much of Georgetown’s environmental progress has been the culmination of student advocacy, and I’m looking forward to what a stronger partnership between students and administrators will lead to,” Boatwright wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Boatwright also hopes the new initiative will make students more aware of the importance of advocating for sustainable energy sources.
“In terms of energy use, I hope that the University will establish new guidelines on energy use and further educate all students on the importance of investing in a green future,” she wrote. 
Audrey Stewart, director of Georgetown’s Office of Sustainability, said she is thrilled with the community enthusiasm and will continue to seek its involvement in future projects. The university has begun looking into ways to achieve 100% renewable energy usage by exploring options for renewable energy sources to heat buildings and to transition the university’s fleet to electric vehicles, according to Stewart.
“Our approach seeks to be inclusive of all members of our university community and all our physical campuses, both across D.C. and around the world,” Stewart wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We seek to positively impact the external communities and partners with whom we work and to meaningfully and materially improve the planet we call home.” 
Marra hopes more steps will be taken to make campus sustainable, including reducing food and plastic waste, sourcing greener energy for campus buildings and reducing rainwater runoff for improved biodiversity. He expects the environmental studies minor will become a major in the future.  
“I want to see Georgetown thought of as a destination for students who want to learn about all things environmental — from the arts to policy to science,” Marra said.

If you truly desire to get the full benefits of your solar electricity purchase, you should procure the exact RECs created for the electricity.  See the FTC guidelines for making environmental claims about green electricity use and REC.

President-elect Joe Biden named several Georgetown University faculty and graduates to serve as advisers or to play prominent roles in his administration this week, including his new chief of staff.
Biden named Ron Klain (CAS ’83) to be his White House chief of staff Nov. 11. Additionally, 10 Georgetown faculty or teaching affiliates were listed on the president-elect’s list of agency review teams, more than any other university. These teams are composed of experts in crucial policy areas across the federal government in order to ensure a smooth transition of power when Biden assumes office Jan. 20, 2021. 
Rebecca Katz, director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at the Georgetown Medical Center, is one of the Georgetown faculty serving on one of the agency review teams. Katz was also selected Nov. 9 as an adviser on the president-elect’s transition coronavirus task force. Katz will serve as one of two health advisers appointed to help guide Biden’s COVID-19 preparations but will not serve on Biden’s coronavirus task force itself.
In the months before her newest appointment, Katz had been advising Biden during the pandemic, alongside two of the new task force’s co-chairs, Vivek H. Murthy, former surgeon general during the Obama administration, and David Kessler, former Food and Drug Administration commissioner under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton.
At Georgetown, Katz is a professor in the department of microbiology and immunology and teaches courses on global health diplomacy, global health security and emerging infectious diseases in the School of Foreign Service. Katz’s expertise in pandemic planning and common-sense approach will help get the virus under control, according to Ellen Carlin, assistant research professor at the Center for Global Health Science and Security.
“She has long and deep knowledge of public health preparedness at scales that range from cities to the global community,” Carlin wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The Biden team is inheriting a public health disaster, and Rebecca has a very common-sense style to approaching what needs to happen next. I think that will be invaluable for getting us through this and to a place where we can start to see real improvement.”
Katz politely declined a request for comment, citing a busy work schedule.
Klain is a Georgetown graduate who will occupy another prominent position in Biden’s administration as his White House chief of staff. He will be the fourth chief of staff in the past 20 years to have graduated from Georgetown, joining Denis McDonough (GRD ’96), John Kelly (GRD ’84) and Mick Mulvaney (SFS ’89).
Klain has previous experience in the White House, having served as former Vice President Al Gore’s chief of staff from 1995 to 1999 as well as then-Vice President Biden’s chief of staff from 2009 to 2011. During the Obama administration, Klain also helped coordinate the U.S. response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014.
Back in March, Klain was particularly critical of President Donald Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic as he said at a virtual Zoom forum titled “Leadership During Crisis: Combating the Coronavirus,” hosted by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and the Georgetown Global Health Initiative.
“We need transparency. We need candor. We need science-led leadership,” Klain said at the event. “That’s the kind of communication that’s going to reassure people and going to tell people we have a plan in place to fight this thing effectively.”
In a statement, Biden called Klain an “invaluable” adviser, citing the work they did together both during the economic crisis in 2009 and the Ebola outbreak in 2014.
“His deep, varied experience and capacity to work with people all across the political spectrum is precisely what I need in a White House chief of staff as we confront this moment of crisis and bring our country together again,” Biden said.
This is a developing story.

Georgetown University has previously invested millions of dollars in three American fossil fuel companies with track records of violating environmental regulations and polluting the communities they operated in, according to previously confidential investment information disclosed to the federal government this summer. 
Federal financial records also revealed a gradual increase since fall 2019 in the university’s share of a Canadian mining company whose principal investment is the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine in southern Mongolia.
Most of the university’s investments are shielded from public view, and the details of the university’s investments in fossil fuels — long a source of criticism from students and environmental activists — have been shrouded in mystery. Recent investment information reported in a summer public federal government filing, however, sheds light on previously undisclosed specifics about the university’s financial stakes in fossil fuel corporations.
Public Georgetown 13F-HR investment reports from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission released in August disclose previously unlisted university investments in Range Resources, PDC Energy and Antero Resources, three companies that specialize in the exploration and extraction of fossil fuels. 
13F-HR reports, which disclose publicly traded securities, provide a snapshot of the state of university investments at the end of each fiscal quarter. These reports are federally mandated for the management of accounts that meet or exceed $100 million worth of investments during a yearly quarter. 
The university’s 13F-HR filing from the second quarter of 2020, which runs from April 1 to June 30, reveals Georgetown owned a total of 1,952,604 shares, valued at almost $9.6 million, from the three corporations.
Investments in the three companies do not appear on any prior Georgetown 13F-HR reports, which date back to February 2018. 
The university owned 3,904,298 million shares worth $1.855 million in Turquoise Hill Resources, the majority owner of Oyu Tolgoi mine, in November 2019, according to the  school’s 13F-HR filing published that month. Georgetown currently owns 11,194,219 million shares in the mining company valued at around $9.44 million, according to the most recent filing published in November 2020. 
The university adopted a “Do No Harm” investment policy in 2017, which precluded the university’s investment office, in principle, from making any investments in projects that have an “extremely deleterious effect on the environment.” 
Contaminated water and surrounding soil from open-pit gold mining has disastrous effects on the environment, according to peer-reviewed studies. Mercury, hydrogen cyanide and sulfide emissions from mining operations can pollute the air and contaminate waterways. A decrease in human health and unsafe livestock consumption are also directly correlated with open-pit mining. 
The Oyu Tolgoi mine, a combined open-pit and underground mining project, is one of the largest copper mines in the world. 
A university spokesperson declined to provide any specifics about Georgetown’s financial relationship with Turquoise Hill. 
In February 2020, the administration pledged to initiate divestment from fossil fuel companies and halt any new investments in that sector. When asked why the fossil fuel company investments only appeared on the university’s June 13F-HR filing, a university spokesperson said the university took on investments previously managed by an outside investment manager. 
“In the first quarter, the University terminated a relationship with an external investment manager that focuses on public natural resource companies,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The Investment Office opted to receive shares in kind rather than have the manager liquidate certain positions during the turbulence of March this year.”
The university spokesperson declined to clarify exactly when the stocks were transferred from the external investment manager and when the university initiated positions in the companies listed. 
“The University does not disclose specific information regarding investments in the endowment portfolio,” the spokesperson wrote.  
The spokesperson said the university plans on divesting from all of its public and private fossil fuel assets within the next 10 years, as outlined in the university’s divestment pledge. 
The university’s third-quarter 13F-HR filing indicates Georgetown has not yet sold any shares from the three fossil fuel companies or Turquoise Hill since the second quarter of 2020. 
The 13F-HR filings do not specify when the university began making investments in the companies mentioned, and the forms can not provide a detailed history of the university’s finances, according to 13F-HR filing experts who spoke with The Hoya.  
It remains unclear why stocks for the three companies did not appear on the 13F-HR filing for the first quarter of 2020 if they were transferred to the university in March. 
The university did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this matter. 
The Companies… 
Founded in 1976, Range Resources explores and produces petroleum and natural gas. It operates drilling infrastructure in the Appalachia and the Gulf Coast regions of the United States. The Fort Worth-based corporation produces approximately 2.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas daily, according to a recent company investor presentation. 
In 2014, Range Resources paid over $4 million in fines and settlements to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection after a fracking fluid spill. The spill contaminated water sources in the southwestern portion of the state with toxic chemicals such as arsenic, toluene and benzene, according to The New York Times. Three years earlier, Range Resources and two other companies reportedly paid a Pennsylvania family $750,000 to cease any mention that Range Resources had destroyed their property for private fossil fuel development, according to NPR. 
Georgetown owns 1,056,221 shares in Range Resources worth close to $7 million as of November 12, 2020.  
A spokesperson for Range Resources did not comment on the company’s relationship with Georgetown but said the company has adopted a “robust approach to sustainability” with efforts like carbon offset and recycling water.
The second fossil fuel company listed on the SEC filing, PDC Energy, produces nearly 6.2 million barrels of oil daily, according to an internal news release published in August. PDC concentrates most of its operations in the Wattenberg Gas Field in Colorado and the Delaware Basin in Texas. 
In 2017, PDC Energy paid over $22 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which alleged that storage tanks at PDC facilities in Colorado violated state and federal pollution statutes. In a separate incident four years prior, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission fined PDC after approximately 84,000 gallons of fracking solution poured out of a storage well, contaminating the surrounding groundwater, according to a study from Colorado State University. 
Georgetown owns 131,860 shares in PDC Energy worth over $1.6 million as of November 12, 2020. 
A spokesperson for PDC Energy did not respond to a request for comment.  
Antero Resources, which explores and produces natural gas, oil, propane and ethane, encountered similar legal troubles because of its operations. Antero Resources generates approximately 3.77 million cubic feet of natural gas daily, according to the company’s 2020 third-quarter highlights. Based in Denver, Antero Resources is the country’s third-largest producer of natural gas, operating primarily in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. 
Antero Resources paid over $3.15 million in a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in 2019. The settlement surrounded the unauthorized disposal of fracking substances into local waterways, according to Reuters. In 2016, the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection fined Antero Resources nearly $100,000 for waterway pollution caused by a pipeline installation, according to Marcellus Drilling News, a news website focused on shale. 
Georgetown owns 764,523 shares of Antero Resources valued at over $2 million as of November 12, 2020. 
A spokesperson for Antero Resources did not respond to a request for comment. 
Unlike the fossil fuel companies, investments in Turquoise Hill appeared on previous 13F-HR filing forms. Turquoise Hill investments first appeared on the university’s public SEC filings in November 2019, revealing that Georgetown held 3.9 million shares of the Canadian mining company. Turquoise Hill, whose only material asset is the Oyu Tolgoi mine, is a subsidiary of the Rio Tinto mining conglomerate. Ninety-five percent of the population in the South Gobi Desert region in Mongolia, where the mine is located, is at risk of drinking contaminated groundwater polluted by residue from Oyu Tolgoi mining operations, according to a 2016 study published in the Journal of Water and Health. In a separate 2018 study, researchers at the National University of Mongolia found that levels of arsenic and copper in the soil surrounding the mining area significantly exceeded the maximum permissible level set by the Mongolian government, which holds a 34% share in the mine. 
Local herders in the area observed that mining activities put more pressure on existing water supplies, which are already limited in the region. The World Bank issued a report in April 2010 before the mine’s construction indicating that the region’s groundwater reserves would be exhausted between 2020 and 2022. The report suggested the development of the Herlen-Gobi and Orhon-Gobi pipelines for importing water to the region because of the preexisting exploitation of water resources from increased regional economic activity such as mining. 
…and the Confidential
The university’s investment office manages existing shares of Turquoise Hill and the three fossil fuel companies. Select members of the board of directors, the Investment Office and the asset managers chosen by the Investment Office manage the university’s roughly $1.9 billion endowment. The board’s nine-member Subcommittee on Investments oversees the operations of the Investment Office. 
Investments in Antero Resources, Range Resources, PDC Energy and Turquoise Hill belong to the roughly $63 million in assets disclosed through 13F-HR filings, which currently account for around 3.3% of the university’s approximately $1.9 billion in endowment investments. The general public is only privy to these domestic public holdings, which the university must disclose to the SEC every quarter. 
The administration issued its fossil fuel divestment pledge in February 2020 after years of pressure from student organizers, who demanded the university take concrete steps to protect the environment. Approximately 90% of Georgetown undergraduates expressed support for divestment in a student referendum pioneered by GU Fossil Free, a student-led campaign for divestment. 
When the university pledged to divest from fossil fuels, around 5% of the university’s endowment was invested in fossil fuels, a university spokesperson told The Hoya at the time, amounting to approximately $95,000,000 in investments. The university’s investments in Range Resources, PDC Energy and Antero Resources would have accounted for around 10.5% of the $95 million tranche. 
The university did not reply to any questions regarding the lack of information for the remaining $1.8 billion and what independent policies are in place to ensure the Investment Office follows through on its divestment promises.

Thirteen years after Melissa Lavasani emerged from Macalester College as a star on her tennis team, she was crawling up her stairs at the end of every day. It was then that Lavasani, who was suffering from postpartum depression, discovered psilocybin, the psychoactive component found in magic mushrooms. She began to feel human again. 
“My life has transformed,” Lavasani said before the Washington, D.C. Board of Elections in January. “Entheogenic plants and fungi empowered me to take control and to make the necessary changes to save my life.”
Lavasani’s experience of the healing potential of psilocybin inspired her to submit the paperwork to put Initiative 81 on D.C.’s ballots this past Election Day. The initiative makes entheogens, chemical substances with psychoactive effects frequently used for spiritual development or religious rituals, among the lowest law enforcement priorities for the Metropolitan Police Department.
On Nov. 3, voters in the District passed Initiative 81. Now, it moves to the D.C. City Council for review and then to Congress before it can become law, as per the D.C. Home Rule Act.
Initiative 81 does not legalize entheogenic plants and fungi such as psilocybin mushrooms, but instead declares D.C.’s enforcement of drug laws against these substances as the lowest priority. It also calls on the D.C. Attorney General and U.S. Attorney for D.C. to cease the prosecution of residents who engage with these drugs.
Lavasani was inspired by a growing body of research that suggests America’s current mental health treatment system is failing. 
“Right now, we have an illness care system,” Lavasani said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “There are for-profit companies making money off of us being sick.”
Lavasani noted that despite tremendous breakthroughs through antidepressants such as Prozac, depression remains the leading cause of disability worldwide. 
Leading medical institutions such as Johns Hopkins University, New York University, Stanford University and the University of California at Los Angeles are all currently contributing to the growing field of medical literature studying the effectiveness of psilocybin in treating mental illness, according to Lavasani, who is part of the campaign Decriminalize Nature D.C., which hopes to increase accessibility to entheogens. 
“When I was growing psilocybin in my house, I was very fearful that the wrong person was going to find out, and I would have lost my job. Something would have impacted my kids,” Lavasani said. “People who are using this to heal themselves shouldn’t feel the fear from the war on drugs.”
Initiative 81 works to realign policing away from the logic of the war on drugs, according to Lavasani. 
“We are the only police reform measure on the ballot,” Lavasani said. “We need to be looking at what role does police play in our communities and what needs to change with that.”
Lavasani emphasized that police disproportionately enforce strict anti-drug laws against people of color.
“We all know that Black and brown people are subject to policing in very different ways than other groups of people, or other demographics are,” Lavasani said. “White people have the agency to try and experiment with these types of things without really fearing that they’re going to lose a lot in their lives. Why should Black and brown communities be robbed of that experience as well?”
Lavasani’s campaign has not gone unopposed, with area officials like Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD) arguing the measure is inadvisable and reckless. 
“This is a bald-faced attempt to just make these very serious, very potent, very dangerous — both short-term and long-term — hallucinogenic drugs broadly available,” Harris said to the New York Post. 
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser came out against Initiative 81, saying she did not usually endorse measures not created for the District specifically.
“It seems like the issue is not an organically D.C.-created initiative, and I don’t typically favor those. I won’t be voting for it,” Bowser said in a news conference Oct. 26.
Lavasani said campaigning during a pandemic has posed challenges for her and her team. 
“Normally I would be doing events in the evenings. On the weekends I’d be running all over the city being in living rooms of friends who invite their friends over and speaking to them about this issue. We just haven’t been able to do that,” Lavasani said. “It’s forced us to be really creative with how we get the word out about us.”
In the run-up to the Nov. 3 election, Lavasani’s posters hung in nearly every street of the District. The campaign’s outreach led to an endorsement from the Democratic Party and support from the Green Party, Libertarian Party and various environmental and healthcare groups, according to Lavasani.
Lavasani believes Georgetown University students are witnessing a special moment in the nation’s history, with many cities across the country passing similar measures similar to Initiative 81. 
“I think the entire country is watching this right now: Denver, Oakland, Santa Cruz; Oregon has the measure on the ballot; Ann Arbor passed, but Washington, D.C., is the capital of our nation,” Lavasani said. “As a student of Georgetown, you’re in the thick of it, and this is really history being made in your backyard.”
Still, for Lavasani and her team, the focus is transforming the American healthcare system. 
“This movement that’s happening right now, 100 cities have groups formed for Decrim,” Lavasani said. “This could potentially truly change how our entire healthcare system works, and it’s going to improve things for the better.”

The Georgetown University School of Foreign Service hired former FBI agent Peter Strzok (SFS ’91, GRD ’13) as an adjunct professor this semester to teach a course on counterintelligence theory and practice, a move that has received public scrutiny from conservative media outlets in recent weeks after the hiring.
Strzok was the lead investigator on the FBI’s 2015 inquiry into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, and he also served as the most senior FBI agent on special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election. Strzok was removed from the Russian investigation and later fired after text messages between him and an FBI lawyer surfaced that were critical of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. 
Strzok pushed back against those who questioned whether his new teaching appointment is appropriate.
“It’s an unfortunate side-effect of our current political environment that some extreme partisans have raised questions about my teaching, but I’m proud of Georgetown’s Jesuit culture of academic excellence and fearless diversity of opinion, for recognizing the value of my deep career experience and academic history, and allowing me the opportunity to bring that to our classrooms,” Strzok wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I’m really enjoying teaching the course, and I look forward to continuing teaching in the future and encouraging and preparing Georgetown students for careers in public service.”
Strzok’s career in counterintelligence provides students with a professor who has firsthand experience in the field, according to an SFS spokesperson. The spokesperson wrote that students at the SFS have the ability to engage critically with Strzok, especially because they know the identity of the instructor before registering for the course. 
“SFS has always provided students with a unique experience where they can learn from faculty that include former and current global policymakers, regulators, and diplomats from different administrations and political parties, and with different political ideologies,” the spokesperson wrote. “Faculty positions are filled on the basis of expertise and the SFS faculty has always included representatives of widely different political backgrounds and views.” 
Strzok teaches an upper-level seminar that surveys the theory behind how U.S. counterintelligence fits into national security practices, drawing examples from his own experiences. His new teaching role has also drawn attention from right-wing media outlets, with articles from Fox News, the Daily Caller and the National Review reviving discussion online about the Russia investigation and Strzok’s subsequent falling-out with the Department of Justice. 
In 2018, Strzok rose to national attention when testifying before the joint House committee, during which he was criticized by Republicans for showing a bias against Trump in texts publicly released by the DOJ. Trump and his supporters have often casted Strzok as a corrupt actor in an attempt to delegitimize the Russia and Clinton investigations. Strzok himself took the FBI and DOJ to court in December 2019, when he alleged they violated his rights to free speech and privacy.
SFS Dean Joel Hellman welcomed Strzok’s return to the SFS as a professor and acknowledged that, while his appointment is controversial, it is a testament to his school’s commitment to free speech and hearing different viewpoints.
“At SFS, we give our students access to leading practitioners in an increasingly polarized political arena,” Hellman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As a result, many of our faculty have invited controversy over the years from all sides of the political spectrum. We do not shield students from political divisions, but encourage discussion and debate.” 
Strzok has had a long history with the Georgetown community. He graduated in 1991 with a bachelor’s degree from the SFS and then served in the Army before embarking on a 22-year career with the FBI, during which he rose to the rank of deputy assistant director of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division. Strzok returned to Georgetown and completed a master’s degree in 2013.
Strzok said that he has always enjoyed mentoring students interested in careers in counterintelligence and the FBI, so returning to Georgetown allows him to continue work he finds rewarding.
“It’s great to be back teaching at Georgetown. As a double Hoya, I really appreciated Georgetown’s faculty, especially the wealth of experienced practitioners the University attracts,” Strzok wrote in an email to The Hoya, “After a career working some of the nation’s most significant counterintelligence work at the FBI, it’s been great to convey that knowledge and real-world experience to another generation of Hoyas.”

It’s a sad commentary when GU hires a disgraced, fired FBI agent to teach counterintelligence. During my undergrad years at GU we were taught by Henry Kissinger, Jean Kirkpatrick and Jules Davis to think for ourselves and not to be influenced by weaponized political activists.

Can’t tell if serious. This guy was fired, but not at all disgraced. 
War criminal Kissinger, otoh, was entirely disgraced, but never fired.
I guess it’s no puzzle that your comment is ridiculous, if he was your mentor.

Brandon says

If Kissinger is a war criminal, then what is assassination-by-drone Obama?  
And by the way, yes Strzok was disgraced. 
GU has a way of continually embarrassing it’s alumni. I can’t wait to see who they hire next.

The number of uninsured children in the United States increased dramatically during the Trump administration, with 2019 showing the largest single-year increase in uninsured child rates in over a decade, according to a report co-authored by two Georgetown University researchers.
The Georgetown University Health Policy Institute Center for Children and Families released the report, titled “Children’s Uninsured Rate Rises by Largest Annual Jump in More Than a Decade,” on Oct. 8. Researchers Joan Alker, the executive director of the CCF, and Alexandra Corcoran, a research associate at the CCF, utilized data from the American Community Survey, an annual demographics survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, to analyze child uninsurance rates and possible explanations for why children lose insurance.
From 2018 to 2019, the United States saw the largest annual increase in the number of uninsured children. Between those years, 320,000 more children became uninsured, compared with 130,000 more between 2017 and 2018 and 276,000 more between 2016 and 2017, according to the report. These losses occurred prior to the economic downturn brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Before 2017, the rate of uninsured children in the United States had been dropping, meaning these recent findings point to a reversal of earlier progress that was made even under more difficult economic conditions, according to Alker.
“It used to be a good news report. For many years we were making progress and reducing the number of uninsured children and the rate of uninsured children,” Alker said in an interview with The Hoya. “But in 2017 that progress turned around and we started going backwards. It’s very troubling that the trend is now going in the wrong direction because we know how to do this as a country, but now we’re going backwards.”
USCB policies complicate the report’s findings, however. Corcoran said that in 2017, the bureau changed the age cutoff that determines who falls into the category for children. The bureau retroactively updated just one table in the American Community Surveys from 2016 to 2019, according to Corcoran.
“If we’re looking at more detailed breakdowns, we kind of face this challenge where we could only get breakdowns from 2017 to 2019 with the data that we had at the time,” Corcoran said in an interview with The Hoya.
Regardless of these changes, researchers were still able to find that multiple independent factors contributed to the recent decline in children’s health coverage. Efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut Medicaid, cuts in insurance enrollment outreach, lackluster oversight over state Medicaid programs and a hostile climate discouraging immigrant families from enrolling their children in government insurance programs all contributed to the decline, according to a news release from the CCF.
In this most recent report, researchers also included an estimate of child uninsured rates for 2020 based on a model released by the Urban Institute, a social and economic policy think tank. More than 300,000 children could lose their insurance in 2020, according to the model, which looks specifically at job losses caused by the pandemic and the likelihood that people who lose employer-sponsored insurance will end up on public coverage.
These numbers, however, are still  estimates, and ACS will not release 2020 data until September 2021. Regardless, the United States can still expect a large increase in the number of uninsured children because of the pandemic, according to Alker.
Alker said that despite this estimate, there are some mitigating factors that could prevent children from losing insurance, including that Medicaid cannot currently disenroll anyone because of the public health emergency.
The report also examined the politicization of the issues surrounding child insurance rates, with researchers working with several CCF partners to examine state-level data and policy around the issue.
While many states have attempted to make child insurance a nonpartisan issue, the Trump administration and some state governments have done the exact opposite, according to Alker.
“There certainly are certain states that tend to be red states that are doing worse in the south and out west. But there are some exceptions to that, like Alabama, who has always been a real leader in children’s coverage,” Alker said. “It’s not a completely clear-cut situation. But unfortunately, in this administration, they have made repeated attempts to take coverage away from people in different ways, and that includes children.”
Despite the failings of some governing figures, there have been positive steps over the past few years toward improving children’s health coverage, with state legislatures in Ohio and Louisiana using the CCF report to inform policy in their respective states, according to researchers.
Ultimately, researchers hope the report can be effectively used to greatly diminish the number of uninsured children in the United States, according to Alker.
“We have a mission, and our mission is to make sure that kids get good health care,” Alker said. “It’s really a central piece of what we do because it’s not sitting on a shelf somewhere; it’s actually being actively used in state capitals all around the country to promote good policy change for children.”

The Georgetown College held weekly conversations throughout October in a webinar series that invited faculty members to discuss how their research furthers the cause of racial justice.
The series of conversations, titled “‘Such a Time As This’: Racial Justice and the University,” explored how Georgetown University faculty’s research advances racial justice and examined how the pursuit of justice shapes the angles they take in their research. The conversations were held on five successive Wednesdays with the first airing Sept. 30 and the final webinar airing Oct. 28.
The webinar offered an in-depth look into the life’s work of numerous faculty members on campus as well as broader conversations about the intersection of race and academia. Each week’s conversation was organized around a theme and how it related to social justice. The first week centered on ethics and morality, the second on the arts, the third on intersectionality and women, the fourth on science and health and the fifth on spatial politics, a theoretical branch of geography concerning how people relate to others and the world around them. Each webinar featured a faculty moderator, as well as two to three other faculty members who were invited to provide a more in-depth look into their academic careers and how their work related to racial justice.
Professor of African American studies and performing arts and new interim dean of Georgetown College Soyica Diggs Colbert created the webinar series. A summer of protests against racial injustice following the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor pointed to the need for these conversations on campus, according to Colbert.
“The summer after the death of George Floyd, [University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95)] made a statement where he asked members of the community to do some internal work. Really, in the tradition of Jesuit reflection, he asked us to think about how we might understand our own investments and how they might perpetuate racial injustice,” Colbert said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “Initially, we had a teach-in over the summer that was specifically around the death of George Floyd, but then, subsequently, we decided to stage a series of conversations, and that’s where ‘Such a Time as This’ came from.”
History and American studies professor Mireya Loza, who participated in the Oct. 14 webinar, said the series provided a valuable opportunity to discuss the research she and her fellow faculty members are all so passionate about as well as to show that anti-racism should factor into academic work.
“This is a moment where folks who have been doing this research should have a platform to talk and to share their research, their ideas and their teachings,” Loza said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “And for those who haven’t seen this as fundamental to their work, this is a time to reconsider that.” 
Loza, who came to Georgetown just this year, also added that the series helped forge a sense of community between her and her colleagues despite not being on campus.
“It’s been really interesting,” Loza said. “Coming in as a [new] professor during COVID makes the experience strange and [the webinar] makes me feel very welcome that I have a community of scholars to interact with and engage, and there is also a community of students and scholars who are eager to listen to what we have to offer in terms of our expertise.”
Collaborating with colleagues on the series allowed for conversations that are necessary for relating otherwise insular research to the outside world, according to government professor Jamil Scott, who also featured in the Oct. 14 webinar.
“I think a web series like this is important because it puts scholars across fields in conversation with one another and also provides an opportunity for the community to engage with scholars,” Scott wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Opportunities for the students and the community to engage with professors demystifies the work we do beyond teaching and creates open dialogue about how our research relates to what is happening in the world.”
Government professor Terrence Johnson, who joined the first discussion of the series Sept. 30, underscored the integral role Colbert played in making the webinars possible.
“This is the brainchild of Soyica Colbert,” Johnson said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “Without her leadership role as an administrator in the college, I am not sure this webinar would have even happened. Georgetown, I think, is compelled to make decisions like this because of strong leaders like Soyica, who are at the helm and pushing the university to make good on its commitments.”
Colbert hopes that attendees take ideas discussed in the webinar series beyond the gates of the university. The webinar was about applying the work done on campus and in the classroom to the broader social context of racial justice in our everyday life, according to Colbert.
“I hope that the students who watch begin to see how the work we do in the classroom can connect to the work we do in the world. Part of what we wanted the seminar to do is think about the implications of this work for the larger social context of racial justice,” Colbert said. “For Georgetown specifically, that’s mission-centered work because all of our work is for the common good. So hopefully, students who watch it will get a chance to think about their work and relate it to their larger mission as students at Georgetown.”

Georgetown University has implemented a hybrid learning pilot program this November, which includes three undergraduate courses and 14 graduate courses of varying sizes to assess the possibility of reintroducing in-person learning in the spring. 
The university pilot staggered the hybrid courses’ start dates at the beginning of the month to control the number of new people coming onto campus at one time, but each course will end at Thanksgiving break, which begins Nov. 20. 
The classes in the pilot program range in size from seven to 36 students and are arranged to ensure social distancing. These in-person classes are taught at four different locations on the main campus, where the university installed technologies such as microphones and Zoom-compatible projectors to facilitate hybrid instruction, according to a university spokesperson. 
“We are very grateful to the faculty and students involved in the pilots, utilizing our badging and testing systems, working closely with CNDLS and CETS teams, and engaging with the new technologies in the classroom,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “These pilots are an important step in helping us to gain further knowledge about the processes and procedures that might be necessary for future hybrid courses on the Georgetown campus.”
Assistant professor Rahul Gupta is one of the faculty participating in the pilot program. His Strategic Management course transitioned into hybrid learning Nov. 2 and will continue until the Thanksgiving break cutoff. 
The pilot program represents an important opportunity to assess and plan for the possibilities for the spring semester, according to Gupta.
“The idea for the pilot has floated around for some time and involves virtually every layer of the University’s stakeholders and decision makers,” Gupta wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As the University crafts policy for the spring semester, it is important to be able to collect data on how hybrid affects student engagement both for those in person and online.” 
As a first-year professor, Gupta is thrilled with the opportunity to teach on campus for the first time, but he wrote that he understands not all faculty and staff are as eager or comfortable with returning to the classroom.
Future planning must assess students’ responses to the pilot and take into account vulnerable students’ needs, according to Gupta. 
“It is critically important to gauge student interest, learning outcomes, whether virtual students are severely disadvantaged when some of their peers are able to meet in person, and long term compliance with health and safety measures,” he wrote. 
Initially, only students in one section of Gupta’s course were eligible to attend the class in person. Regan Donecker (MSB ’21), however, advocated for seniors in the other sections already living in the neighborhood to also be allowed on campus, which the administration approved. 
“I reached out to professor Gupta about pushing for seniors of all sections to be approved to go on campus because so many of us are already in the neighborhood, so many of us have been tested on a regular basis, and we’re really just looking for that sense of community and just that extra resource of having access together,” Donecker said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Students were notified about the pilot program about two weeks before it began, according to Donecker. 
“We were told to fill out an interest form on Google Forms to see interest in the pilot, and then within two days we were emailed that the pilot was officially starting with a list of all of the different requirements that we had to follow,” Donecker said. 
The regulations for the pilot program come from the Community Compact that other on-campus students have to follow, including daily check-ins on the One Medical app to track COVID-19 symptoms and testing for COVID-19 twice weekly.
As a student already living in the Georgetown neighborhood, the choice to participate in the pilot program in person was a no brainer for Donecker, she said. 
“Personally, I have no underlying conditions, so I didn’t have any concerns in terms of being in person,” Donecker said. “Also, I genuinely think that the school is capable of opening up at least some classes in person because I did not feel unsafe in the slightest going into the classroom. It was definitely a no brainer because working at home virtually has been really, really hard.”
Other students in the course opted to stay online, though, including Christopher Miller (MSB ’21), who lives north of Baltimore, making in-person attendance difficult. 
The class’s switch to a hybrid setting has made the course difficult for Miller when he is still participating on Zoom, he said.
“It’s a little strange, I’ll be honest. If you focus more on looking down at the screen that’s going to benefit us at home, versus if you’re looking up like you would in a regular setting, that’s going to be more beneficial to people there,” Miller said in an interview with The Hoya. “That’s a minor thing, but I think that’s a question of attention and direction of your message. So that’s part of it, but obviously there are no perfect solutions to any of this; it’s all about making it work.” 
There are about 15 students who attend the class in-person twice a week, while the rest tune in over Zoom, according to Donecker. 
Donecker said that her experience of the pilot program has been positive thus far. 
“Overall, the class is going really well. My roommates and I were noting just how much easier it was to pay attention in the classroom and being around a professor, to even interrupt and be willing to ask a question when you were confused because it didn’t feel like you were interrupting as much,” Donecker said. “It was more just like a very traditional classroom setup.”
