A Georgetown University professor authored a book about the history and development of the Chicago Latinx community between World War II and the 1990s, looking at instances of deportation, segregation and oppression. 
Mike Amezcua, assistant professor in the department of history, wrote “Making Mexican Chicago: From Postwar Settlement to the Age of Gentrification” after exploring Latinx history in Chicago through stories about his grandmother, who was deported from Chicago with her parents during the Great Depression. 
“Making Mexican Chicago” examines a tumultuous period in time for Mexican immigrants, according to Amezcua.
“It was a moment when hundreds of thousands of Mexican immigrants and their children, American citizens, were rounded up and repatriated because they were blamed for parts of the ills of the economy during that time,” Amezcua said in an interview with The Hoya. “The idea for the book goes way back to then because it thought about what kind of city my grandmother would have inherited in Chicago. She never returned to Chicago and lived the remainder of her life in Mexico.”
Amezcua spent 10 years writing “Making Mexican Chicago” and spoke with urban historians, Latinx historians and community members in Chicago in order to complete the book. 
“This is something that I not only went to traditional archives for but also that I actually built relationships with Mexican and American communities in Chicago so that those communities would share documents and photos with me so that I could complement my archival research that I was doing with community-based knowledge about the city,” Amezcua said.
The book tells an important history of mid- to late-20th century Chicago through the perspective of Mexican immigrants, according to Brian Hochman, director of American studies. 
“This is what makes Professor Amezcua’s research so impressive,” Hochman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “By centering Mexican immigrants in the remaking of Chicago’s post-WWII geography and politics, he has told a compelling new story that will force scholars of urban America to reimagine the field’s dominant narratives.” 
Chicago is not usually perceived as a city with a large Latinx presence, but it is actually home to one of the first Mexican communities in the United States, according to John Tutino, a professor in the department of history who teaches undergraduate and graduate courses on Mexico in the context of the Americas and the world. 
“What Mike’s book does is really focus on the community organizing itself, engaging to make a strong community within Chicago and doing it by engaging the city’s political powers and other ethnic groups,” Tutino said. “It is not only a pivotally important book in Mexican American history, but it is a pivotally important book in U.S. urban history because it shows the multicultural city being created post-World War II.”
While cities like New York City, Los Angeles and Houston are usually associated with large Latinx communities, Chicago has the fifth largest Latinx population with 774,000 people. 
Amezcua said that Chicago remains one of the most segregated cities in the United States with predominantly white local governments and citizens practicing illegal methods of separation and redlining to resist immigration, a topic covered in “Making Mexican Chicago.” 
“There was this unspoken agreement between neighbors to hold the line, not just against Mexican immigrants, but a belief that by holding the line against Latinx people you would then also be holding the line against African Americans,” Amezcua said. “It was almost like this two tiered form of segregation, and I wanted to make sure to show that on the ground, block by block.”
Amezcua wanted to examine the often overlooked stories of immigrants in Chicago.
“I found the story so profound, and I thought I need to write about Chicago,” Amezcua said. “I decided that while there are cities in the United States with much higher Latinx populations, there has already been a lot of good work on the East Coast and the West Coast but not the Midwest and a big metropolis like Chicago.”

Examining diversity, equity and inclusion is crucial for effective conflict prevention and diplomatic solutions, according to a new book titled “Untapped Power: Leveraging Diversity and Inclusion for Conflict and Development.” 
The book, published Feb. 12, was edited by Carla Koppell, senior advisor for diversity, equity and inclusion in the Walsh School of Foreign Service and a Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security distinguished fellow. 
“Untapped Power” includes contributions from 40 authors, including scholars, policy makers, researchers and activists from around the world. The book covers a variety of topics including gender inequality, LGBTQ rights, disability rights and the liberties of ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities. 
Koppell hopes that by reading the book, people can better understand the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion in global affairs. 
“First, I hope that it makes a persuasive case to show that diversity, equity and inclusion issues are essential whenever you’re engaging globally,” Koppell said in an interview with The Hoya. “The second is that it gives readers an in-depth sense of how to approach these issues of equity and inclusion and the growing diversity of societies in ways that improve the effectiveness of interventions.”
Including diverse identities when practicing diplomacy is essential to creating successful solutions, according to Koppell.  
“Fundamentally, diversity, equity and inclusion issues are always relevant,” Koppell said. “Whether we’re talking about how you negotiate a peace accord and who you think about both in terms of who needs to be at those negotiations, whose interests you need to serve, whose priorities need to be reflected in that accord, whether you’re talking about development and how you promote development in any sector.”
Claudia Escobar, an SFS centennial fellow who wrote a chapter in the book, said diversity is especially crucial in decision-making spaces.
“I would hope that readers will find material to be able to advance in the inclusion of vulnerable groups in the different decision-making spaces, especially in the institutions that promote development, human rights, and the rule of law,” Escobar wrote to The Hoya. “I believe that the book can be a tool to put the problems of discrimination of vulnerable groups in the discussion of the academic sector.” 
Diversity is important in the judicial system which has historically not been diverse and therefore corrupt, according to Escobar, who previously worked as a magistrate for the Guatemalan Court of Appeals.
It is important to hold discussions on inclusion in academia, according to Madison Schramm, who wrote a chapter in the book author featured in the book and a professor at the U.S. Army War College
“Thinking about curricula–what types of research and by whom–are on the syllabus; thinking about how much value we give to work that centers historically marginalized populations; or how much of our understanding of the world centers on the experiences and perspectives of very few. We have a lot of work to do,” Schramm wrote to The Hoya.
Cementing diversity into discussions about security is integral to promoting peace, according to Teuta Avdimetaj, a researcher at the Kosovo-based think tank the Kosovar Center for Security Studies (KCSS) who collaborated on the book
“We already know that peace is more likely to last when women are part of peacemaking processes,”Avdimetaj wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The equal representation and participation of groups that have been traditionally left out at the margins of decision-making ensures that a broader range of issues and perspectives are accounted for in the peacemaking process.” 
These issues are especially important because the absence of diversity in diplomacy can ultimately be harmful and dangerous, Georgetown Vice Dean of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Scott Taylor said. 
“The exclusion of large populations, exclusions of certain peoples, usually leads to conflict,” Taylor said. 
Taylor said diversity facilitates more peace in the world. 
“When more people are at the table, when more viewpoints are represented, and more variety of people and citizens that make up the fabric of this country or another, are part of these conversations, that helps to facilitate more peaceful outcomes,” Taylor said.

The Georgetown University Dance Company (GUDC) performed their annual showcase in person for the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The performance was held in the Gonda Theatre in the Davis Performing Arts Center on Feb. 18 and 19 and featured pieces choreographed by members of the company, guest choreographer Shaun Boyle D’Arcy and Faculty Artistic Director Raina Lucas. This year’s showcase was entitled “re_calibration.”
Despite having to adjust to changing protocols multiple times throughout the season and adapting to a last-minute casting change when a student in the production tested positive for COVID-19 two days before the company’s first performance, the show went on. 
Lucas said she is proud of the work the company has achieved despite the turbulent season. 
“I am so proud of the students, and honestly it was surreal to be back in the Gonda Theatre,” Lucas said in an interview with The Hoya. “We’ve been through a lot of challenges as a company, so I’m just really happy we had the chance to return to the stage with a live, in-person audience.”
Student Artistic Director Michelle Du (COL ’22) said the shows were a success as the theater was sold out both nights. 
“We had to cope with a lot of uncertainties with the virtual beginning to the semester, but I think the company worked really hard as a team,” Du said in an interview with The Hoya. “We were able to pull together with the support of the department, our tech crew and everyone who was involved in the production, and I think it was one of our most successful productions yet.” 
The show, which saw around 500 attendees each night, featured performances from 20 dancers over 10 pieces. 
Cate Walter (COL ’25) said the company was about to start its usual run-through of the showcase when the student received her positive test result.
“We just had a company meeting before rehearsal and talked about what the plan was, and we were all required to get tested Thursday and Friday,” Walter said in an interview with The Hoya. “She was at rehearsal and everyone’s faces just dropped — we were all just like, ‘What are we going to do?’”
But the company adapted well, changing scenes that the student was meant to be in, according to Co-Production Director Christina Dropulic (COL ’22). 
“It was a shock and there were definitely some nerves, but I think that, as usual, we persevered very well through it,” Dropulic said. “Everything ended up looking okay, and that’s a testament to how adaptable this company is, especially after our COVID year and how flexible we had to be during that time.”
The company, which began rehearsal for the showcase in September, was forced to operate virtually for a week in the fall following a COVID-19 exposure during the first two weeks of the spring semester when the university operated virtually, Dropulic said. 
While virtual rehearsals made choreographing more difficult, Co-Production Director Juliana Peacock (COL ’22) said it left more room for individual interpretation of dances.
“That first week back in the studio, we were definitely all a little bit nervous to see if what we think we created we actually had,” Peacock said in an interview with The Hoya. “It ended up being definitely different than I anticipated but in a good way — I think it gave the cast members an opportunity to put a little more of themselves in the dance than they could have otherwise.”
Dropulic said while the first show back was nerve-racking, it was also a bittersweet swan song to the four years she has spent with the company.
“It was a lot of nerves to perform well and present myself well after having missed the stage for a while, but also just the biggest happiness to be back with my company and be back doing what I love,” Dropulic said. “Performing is really one of the primary reasons why I’m a part of GUDC and why I love to dance.”

A Georgetown University graduate instituted a new merit-based scholarship fund for Master of Business Administration (MBA) students at the McDonough School of Business (MSB) to promote diversity, equity and inclusion.
Patrick Sheridan (GRD ’09), CEO of Modus Create, Inc., a consulting firm that works with technology and software companies, established the Patrick Sheridan Endowed MBA Scholarship Fund to increase cultural understanding throughout the MSB. 
The MSB will be able to recruit a student body for its MBA program that is more reflective of different backgrounds, perspectives and experiences as a result of this scholarship, according to Prashant Malaviya, senior associate dean of MBA programs.
“We will be able to invite and attract new perspectives, encourage equitable representation of diverse voices, and adapt our curriculum and policies to the needs and aspirations of a diverse community,” Malaviya wrote to The Hoya. “By attracting students who are passionate about promoting DEI and creating a just and inclusive community, we hope to develop a strong, resilient culture of care and compassion for everyone.”
Sheridan said that his past three years serving on the MBA Alumni Advisory Council (MAAC), the board of graduate representatives that advises deans on MBA programs and promotes alumni engagement, allowed him to work with the school on its diversity initiatives.
“During that time I’ve primarily contributed to the Alumni Mentorship and Creating Equality subcommittees and have been very impressed by the school’s efforts to be at the forefront of the discussion on DEI within academia and the broader business world,” Sheridan wrote to The Hoya. 
The Sheridan scholarship fund will allow the MSB to make an impact in multiple Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) dimensions, according to Malaviya.
“This Fund will allow us to support our initiatives to strengthen the Community and Culture in the program and the school, and support new Co-curricular initiatives created by students, staff, faculty and alumni,” Malaviya wrote.
The MSB lists its comprehensive “7Cs of DEI” goals that the school strives to meet in an effort to promote diversity and inclusion at the school: composition, communication, curriculum, co-curriculum, careers, community and culture.
The scholarship fund represents graduates’ dedication to the student experience at the MSB, according to Paul Almeida, dean of the MSB.
“The Patrick Sheridan Endowed MBA Scholarship Fund is one of many ways he continues to break barriers and improve equity in the pursuit of education and professional growth,” Almeida wrote in an email to The Hoya. “His generosity enables the McDonough School of Business to carry forward on important initiatives to transform DEI in our classrooms and in our communities of influence.”
Modeled after scholarships within Modus Create, this scholarship for MSB students gives top priority to applicants who come from diverse backgrounds or perspectives, according to Sheridan.
“Similar to the previous scholarship we funded via Modus Create, this scholarship is merit based, with preference given to non-traditionally educated candidates or candidates with a career focus on diversity and inclusion,” Sheridan wrote.
The previous scholarship, named the Modus Create Endowed MBA Scholarship, funded another merit-based award to support workforce development in Latin America for international full-time and Flex MBA students, with preference given to residents of Costa Rica, Brazil, Colombia, Puerto Rico and Mexico.
According to Malaviya, this scholarship is a step toward ongoing priorities of promoting diversity, equity and inclusion at the MSB.
“We hope that this Fund will motivate other alumni to support our many diversity and inclusion initiatives,” Malaviya wrote. “We know many alumni care deeply about DEI, and this fund we hope will inspire others to step up and strengthen our efforts to promote diversity in our community.”
MSB graduates and their continued involvement with the school are what make the MSB a positive and fulfilling experience for students, according to Almeida.
“It is through the work of alumni such as Patrick, that we are able to live out our Jesuit values and foster a community in diversity, celebrate unique perspectives, and create a supportive and welcoming culture where everyone has access to the resources they need to further their academic and career-related goals,” Almeida wrote.

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) opened applications for its Direct Impact Initiatives (DII), which aims to provide electronic and physical aid resources to the undergraduate population. 
This year’s resources include 15 Chromebooks, five steerable knee-walkers and five manual wheelchairs, which will be distributed to students on a first-come, first-served basis for either a one or two-week period. Students can also sign up to be put on waitlists if items are completely checked out. The program is still in its pilot stage, and more resources will be made available as the DII expands, according to a post on GUSA’s Instagram. 
GUSA chose to implement the application-based format of the program because of university limitations on aid and logistical concerns, according to GUSA President Nile Blass (COL ’22).
“The application format allows us to monitor who is using the resources and to keep track of inventory,” Blass told The Hoya. “We also cannot give money to individual students or groups. The finance office makes the argument that you can’t actually, as an organization, put money into something that multiple students can’t benefit from all at once.”
GUSA hoped that these resources will serve students for years to come, according to GUSA Senate Vice Speaker Rowlie Flores (COL ’22).
“We already have purchased loaner chromebooks and wheelchairs that GUSA can administer to the greater student body. It’s hard to picture how long DII will last, but we hope that this is something that the executive can push for years to come,” Flores wrote to The Hoya. 
The DII are important for student advocacy as they have the best practical and direct impact on the student body, according to Blass.
“We talk a lot about representations and symbolic gestures for the benefit of the student body, but I think a lot of the work that GUSA has done that is most impactful and most transformative is direct impact,” Blass said. “Supporting students with practical means, especially marginalized and low-income students is important.” 
The GUSA transition committee plans to work with the newly elected Kole Wolfe (SFS ’24) and Zeke Ume-Ukeje (COL ’24) administration, who will assume office in mid-March, to ensure that current GUSA advocacy efforts, including the DII, continue, according to Flores. 
“It’s important to us that we make sure that the Wolfe/Ume-Ukeje administration have all the information they need to be an efficient and effective administration, while respecting the fact that they are the new executives and need to make these decisions themselves,” Flores said. 
The new GUSA executive administration will continue certain projects started by the previous administration, according to President-elect Kole Wolfe (SFS ’24). 
“We are currently working on our budget in preparation for the summit on Saturday. We aim to make Nile’s Farmer’s Market and Minority Business Initiative, which is scheduled to occur this April, a recurring event and hold a similar event in the Fall,” Wolfe wrote to The Hoya. “We have been in contact with her regarding this initiative. We also are in talks with the Corp to establish a joint book affordability scholarship program.” 
Saturday GUSA Fin App summit is where student clubs, including GUSA and campus publications, apply for their annual budgets. 
The Farmer’s Market and Minority Business Initiative was started in collaboration with the GUSA Senate, the Black Student Alliance, the BLF, and the Georgetown Farmers Market, to support more BIPOC businesses at the market, according to Blass. Later this spring the Blass-Sanchez administration is looking to host a block party highlighting local Black culture and vendors, according to Blass.
The Wolfe-Ume-Ukeje ticket campaigned on creating direct impact initiatives, including allocating money from SNAPS, a student neighborhood patrol organization, towards grants for low-income students. 
Despite differences in policy positions between the outgoing and incoming administration, projects dedicated to improving student well-being will not immediately disappear because of differences in policy positions, Blass said. 
“There’s also the Senate, there’s also the SAO, there are a lot of avenues and organizations under GUSA that are dedicated to supporting the student body. So even in the worst case scenario, I think it’ll be fine because it’s not just in their hands,” Blass said.

Students voiced concerns about the lack of public safety threat notifications after an intruder entered a residence hall Feb. 16.
The Georgetown University Police Department (GUPD) responded to a report of an intruder — whom they identified as an individual previously barred from campus — in Loyola Xavier Ryder (LXR) Hall at 6:28 p.m. Feb. 16. The following morning, GUPD Chief of Police Jay Gruber  sent an email to LXR residents about the intrusion. The university did not send a HOYAlert, a message sent to the Georgetown community with guidance in the event of a threat, at any point. 
Brady Stallman (NHS ’24), an LXR resident, saw the intruder in the lobby twice over the course of 45 minutes.  
“I came back from Yates, and there’s this dude just chilling by the printer in our lobby and he’s just mumbling to himself. It was kind of weird, but I didn’t do anything about it,” Stallman said in an interview with The Hoya. “I went up to my room to shower and stuff. I came back down to pick up my order from Wiseys, and there were five GUPD officers around him holding him down and putting cuffs on him.” 
Stallman said that the intruder being in the building for almost an hour before their arrest raises concerns about potential harm that could have been afflicted during that time. 
“If he was a threat, he could have done whatever he wanted. He could have hopped on the elevator and gone up to whatever floor he wanted to,” Stallman said. “My faith in dorm security is not very high.” 
Since the beginning of the academic school year, multiple intruders have broken into campus buildings and the university has sent out belated notifications, notifications only to students in affected residence halls, or no notification at all. 
Katie Sullivan (COL ’24), another LXR resident, saw the intruder when she entered the building after returning from dinner. 
Sullivan, who saw her friend try to escort the intruder out of the building, said that students were not made aware of the intrusion and that no communication about the incident circulated immediately in student group chats either.
“I only know because I saw the guy and I saw my friend take him out,” Sullivan said. “I’ve just been talking to my friend, and in the actual LXR group chat nobody has been talking about it.”
Justin English (COL ’24), who was in LXR at the time of the intrusion and subsequent arrest, had no idea that there was a threat to student safety.  
“I was in my residence, the restroom and in the 2nd floor common room,” English wrote in an email to The Hoya. “There was zero indication that something was going on while I was there alone in the building.”
English only became aware of the incident after the university sent an email to LXR residents over 15 hours after the intruder entered the building. 
“I think that the university failed student’s safety,” English wrote. “The fact that someone was there in the building with zero indication of caution for residents is terrifying.”
English said that the university should have notified students as soon as GUPD was  aware of the intrusion. 
“If someone with violent intent had entered the residence and there was no warning during the time between the police being notified and responding to the incident, people would get hurt in those precious minutes beforehand,” English wrote. “I think that the university could have notified us sooner of the incident and sent out a soft caution notice as the event was being looked into.”
According to a university spokesperson, the university is increasing training for residence hall guards and responds to potential threats in a timely manner.
“The safety of our community is our top priority,” the spokesperson wrote. “When there is an increase in safety incidents anywhere on campus, GUPD increases patrols out of an abundance of caution and takes appropriate steps to respond to ensure the safety of the community.”
Stallman said that students are forced to relay safety threats to each other because of the university’s failure to provide timely notifications. 
“I have no faith in them letting me know of an incident as it’s happening or shortly after it happened,” Stallman said. “Peer communication seems to be very timely and way more effective than GUPD communication.”

Georgetown University announced Feb. 15 the launch of the Earth Commons Institute, which focuses on strengthening the university’s engagement with the environment. 
Through research, education and action, the institute provides an interdisciplinary platform for the study of sustainability and environmental stewardship at undergraduate and graduate levels. Developed from the Georgetown Environment Initiative (GEI), the new institute puts resources and students to work on issues ranging from food and water security to environmental justice and climate change, as well as facilitates degree programs for both graduate and undergraduate students. 
The goal of the Earth Commons is to train the next generation of problem solvers and create a lasting environmental impact, according to Peter Marra, founding director of the Earth Commons.
“There were already a few paths that had started to be paved that I moved forward on, including the development of a new masters program with the business school around the environment and sustainability management,” Marra told The Hoya. “I began thinking more carefully about an undergraduate degree, I began thinking more carefully about bringing on new faculty in particular areas so Georgetown could begin doing research and teaching in particular areas.”
Marra serves as the Director of the GEI and teaches courses about biology and the environment. Marra spent 20 years as the director of the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center.
The Earth Commons has both undergraduate and graduate programs, all of which focus on environmental scholarship and interdisciplinary solutions, Marra said. 
In conjunction with the McDonough School of Business (MSB) and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Earth Commons created a new Master of Science in environment and sustainability management. The program combines science and business and is currently accepting 40 students in advance of its launch in the fall 2022 semester. Graduates will have career opportunities centered around protecting the environment within nonprofits, organizations or the government. 
The new Master of Science in environment and sustainability management gives students the opportunity to engage in a curriculum that includes courses on earth systems, impact investing, the science and economics of climate change and energy, and sustainable supply chains, according to Maria Petrova, co-director of the program. 
“Our unique curriculum combines principles of environmental science with business management skills, delivering the comprehensive knowledge students need to become effective leaders in environment and sustainability,” Petrova wrote. “Key characteristics of the program are its small, 40-person cohort size; two focus areas in climate and energy, taught from both a science and business perspective; and access to thought leaders and business executives that have global and national presence.”
Yasmin Gulamhusein (COL ’24), an intern at the Earth Commons who is working to support the launch of the new master’s program, said that the Earth Commons is already giving her the opportunity to participate in sustainability efforts by conducting her research focused on food waste reduction in higher education institutions.
“From my own experience, the Earth Commons has given me exposure to a community of faculty members and fellow students interested in environmental stewardship,” Gulamhusain wrote. “I would not have previously had the opportunity to pursue my own research nor have had the support of a diverse group of leaders and peers.”
[Disclaimer: Yasmin Gulamhusein serves as a photographer for The Hoya.]
Current undergraduate majors placed within the Earth Commons include environmental biology; science, technology and international affairs with an energy and environment concentration; biology with a concentration in ecology, evolution and behavioral biology; and the earth and environmental engineering program in partnership with Columbia University. 
The Earth Commons will combine academic disciplines and various groups at the university to promote sustainability through academics, according to Meghan Chapple, vice president of sustainability at Georgetown.
“The institute model is a cutting edge approach to environmental and sustainability education and research in that it builds bridges between schools and, through the partnership with the Office of Sustainability, across the administrative practice of the University,” Chapple wrote to The Hoya. “It is a model for the future of higher education, and how working across disciplines is essential to solving our biggest problems on this planet.” 
Shelby Gresch (SFS ’22), an intern at the GEI who will continue her work with the Earth Commons, said the institute is working to engage students from many backgrounds and academic disciplines in environmental protection efforts. 
“It represents the next chapter in Georgetown’s commitment to incorporating environmental issues into every part of the University— academically, socially, and institutionally,” Gresch wrote to The Hoya. “In that spirit, the Earth Commons will offer a variety of opportunities to students, from events to classes to a hub for environmental action.”
Gresch has worked with the Earth Commons to create a living lab consisting of a sustainable garden where students can grow food to be donated to the larger community. The experience also allows students to learn firsthand about sustainable food systems in urban environments by talking to individuals at community gardens, urban farms and university farms. 
Applying solutions through experiential learning is an important part of the Earth Commons’ mission, Marra said.
“The action piece comes from a natural partnership between the need to teach and the need to learn and the need to take action,” Marra said. “Putting students in these situations where they’re problem solving with the faculty and where they’re taking on some of the biggest challenges we have is a perfect way for us to tackle those things through action.”
Marra said that installing a sustainability garden in a prominent location on Georgetown’s campus will allow the community to become more informed about food sources. 
“We’re hoping to put one of these on campus where students are growing food and producing food, not just for themselves but for our community that is struggling with food insecurity,” Marra said. “That’s a big deal, and we want to put it in a prominent location on campus so people are aware of where food comes from.”
In addition to offering academic courses and research, the Earth Commons also draws upon a variety of disciplines, including sections on biodiversity, justice and health. Its undergraduate-led magazine, titled “Common Home,” features writing and art from students, professors and scientists on environmental and sustainability topics. 
Marra said that there are a plethora of options available for student involvement and engagement with the Earth Commons as the institute continues to expand. 
“This is not a siloed institute, this is an institute without walls,” Marra said. “We are an institute that encourages participation from throughout the university. We are a network, not a hierarchy.”
