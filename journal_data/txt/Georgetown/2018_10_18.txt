A drive organized by students who live on Magis Row is set to donate feminine hygiene products to Thrive D.C., a nonprofit organization and the sole provider of homeless services in Washington, D.C.’s Ward 1.
Magis Row, the 16 townhouses located mostly on 36th Street, is one of Georgetown’s independent Living Learning Communities. Reflecting on the Jesuit value of “magis,” residents of Magis Row strive to pursue individual passions while contemplating how to ask “more” of themselves and others, according to the Georgetown University Residential Living website. In line with this core ideal, the Agape, Men’s Socioeconomic Ties and Network of Dialogue, Queen, Frontier and Women in Tech houses sponsored this weeklong drive.
Starting Oct. 9, the Magis Row houses set up a donation station outside of the Agape House on 37th Street to collect individually wrapped pads and tampons; the drive ran through midnight Oct. 16.
Magis Row is set to deliver the supplies to Thrive D.C. at the conclusion of the drive. Founded in 1979 to serve dinner to women experiencing homelessness, Thrive D.C. has grown to become a comprehensive, professionally staffed organization providing a wide range of services to more than 2,000 men, women and children each year.
Feminine hygiene products are often overlooked when assessing the needs of people experiencing homelessness, said Kate Rogers (NHS ’20), co-president of the Georgetown Period Empowerment Project, a student organization that seeks to raise awareness about menstrual hygiene.
“Menstrual products are very expensive, and they are one of the least donated products,” Rogers said. “Without adequate menstrual hygiene, many people are forced to stay home from school or work, and it becomes a vicious cycle.”
Many basic necessities like groceries are tax-exempt in states across the country to prevent excessive costs from harming individuals with lower income, according to The New York Times, but feminine hygiene products used to manage menstrual flow are subject to a value-added tax. Their cost can often be prohibitive for women who are struggling financially, according to Thrive D.C.’s website.
“We really wanted to find a need in the DC community that was not already being met,” Agape resident Ellie Staab (COL ’20) wrote in an email to the Hoya. “Often times homeless shelters receive donations of food, clothing and personal hygiene items such as shampoo or toothpaste. Rarely do they receive donations of feminine hygiene products.”
Through this drive, Staab said, Magis Row aimed to not only collect products for Thrive D.C. but also raise awareness of this issue, which is often considered taboo and goes undiscussed.
Menstruation products are a major component of Thrive D.C.’s aid. The organization has specifically sought donations for tampons and heavy flow/overnight maxi pads.
Many women go without sanitary products because they are too embarrassed to ask for them, forget to get some at a shelter or are unable to obtain the type of product they needed, according to Thrive D.C.’s website.
Georgetown University students sponsored a similar drive last December. As a project for the course “The Political Economy of Entrepreneurship,” students donated 810 tampons and pads to Thrive D.C.
Staab hopes future Georgetown students will continue to stay involved with this cause.
“I think this is definitely something we would consider doing again,” Staab wrote. “Homeless shelters have so many unmet needs besides lack of feminine hygiene products, that this is really just a start.”

Pope Francis accepted the resignation of Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the Archbishop of Washington, D.C., on Oct. 12.
The resignation comes after an August Pennsylvania grand jury report detailed Wuerl’s inconsistent record of handling cases of sexual abuse as bishop of Pittsburgh. Pope Francis’s move was awaited by those who pressured the church to take a harsher stance against officials they see as complicit in the protection of abusers.
Though the pontiff accepted Wuerl’s resignation, he praised the former cardinal and took steps that maintain Wuerl’s influence within the Catholic Church.
“You have sufficient elements to ‘justify’ your actions and distinguish between what it means to cover up crimes or not to deal with problems, and to commit some mistakes,” Pope Francis wrote in a statement. “However, your nobility has led you not to choose this way of defense. Of this, I am proud and thank you.”
Pope Francis also requested that Wuerl, who served as archbishop of Washington since 2006, remain as an interim Apostolic Administrator of the Archdiocese while the church searches for a successor. Wuerl is set to remain in the Congregation for Bishops, granting him a lasting role in shaping the future of the American Catholic Church.
Erica Lizza (SFS ’19), president of Catholic Women at Georgetown, criticized the church’s response as failing to adequately acknowledge the ways in which Wuerl did not hold certain priests accountable.
“This response is discouraging for Catholics who had hoped the church would punish not only abusers, but those who permitted abuse to occur or covered it up,” Lizza wrote in an email to The Hoya. (Full Disclosure: Lizza is a member of The Hoya’s Editorial Board)
The resignation comes amid a movement for the university to rescind the honorary degrees it gave to Wuerl in 2014 and to Theodore McCarrick, who resigned from the College of Cardinals, in 2004. On Sept. 14, ten students delivered a petition to the office of President DeGioia demanding the university revoke those honorary degrees. It has gained 1,507 signatures as of Oct. 17.
The university stated that it will conduct “processes to address the deeply troubling revelations about Archbishop McCarrick” through an honorary degree review process, but did not respond as to whether this included Wuerl. Wuerl has spoken several times at the university, including twice in the fall of 2017.
“As part of our University’s governance practices, President DeGioia has worked with our Board of Directors to assemble an ad hoc Working Group of Board Members to examine the issues related to Honorary Degrees,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This group will focus on the purpose and practice of granting Honorary Degrees; the selection of recipients; and the process around reviewing and rescinding such degrees.”
Wuerl, an ally of Pope Francis, previously developed a reputation as a reformer willing to address sexual abuse in the church. After arriving in Pittsburgh in 1988, he formed a review board for cases of sexual abuse and worked to extend the canonical statute of limitations on allegations from children. He also successfully lobbied the Vatican to prevent the reinstatement of a priest accused of molestation in 1993.
Yet the Pennsylvania grand jury report detailed moves by Wuerl that obscured the extent of sexual abuse and allowed priests accused of sexual abuse to continue in clerical roles.
Wuerl “was actively engaged in the cover-up,” according to the Attorney General of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, in an interview with The Washington Post.
Wuerl maintains a group of supporters that defend his actions in the Pittsburgh diocese. The Archdiocese of Washington released a statement after the report’s release disputing certain elements and defending Wuerl’s tenure.
“While I understand this Report may be critical of some of my actions, I believe the Report confirms that I acted with diligence, with concern for the victims and to prevent future acts of abuse,” Wuerl said in a statement after the report.
Pope Francis’s letter is cryptic, and doesn’t necessarily make clear where the Pope is saying Wuerl did the right thing in resigning, according to Gerard Mannion, Amaturo professor in Catholic Studies at Georgetown University. Mannion also noted that the amount of time before the Vatican took action regarding Wuerl was “a pity.”
“It seems to suggest they do acknowledge Wuerl was not uniformly complicit, nor was he uniformly transparent and doing the right thing neither,” Mannion said in an interview with The Hoya.
Wuerl released a statement after Pope Francis’s acceptance of his resignation, which he offered when he passed the age of 75 as is customary, saying his move allowed the church to move forward.
“Once again for any past errors in judgment I apologize and ask for pardon,” Wuerl wrote. “My resignation is one way to express my great and abiding love for you the people of the Church of Washington.”
The resignation of Wuerl comes less than a week after Pope Francis sanctioned deeper investigation into allegations of sexual abuse against former Cardinal McCarrick. He resigned in July from the College of Cardinals and remains the archbishop emeritus of D.C.

Student activists brought about the establishment of the LGBTQ Resource Center and their energy helped sustain the center, Dan Porterfield (COL ’83), Georgetown University’s former senior vice president of development, said Monday at a discussion in honor of the 10th anniversary of Georgetown’s LGBTQ Center.
The event, cohosted by the LGBTQ Center and the Tagliabue Initiative for LGBTQ Life, featured a conversation between Porterfield and Provost’s distinguished Professor of History and African-American Studies Marcia Chatelain.
Porterfield, president and CEO of the Aspen Institute, an education and policy research organization, helped establish the LGBTQ Center when he served as Georgetown’s senior vice president of development in 2008. The center formed after student working groups that formed as part of the Out for Change Campaign, a campaign in response to a hate crime targeting gay students on campus in 2007, recognized the need for a center to support LGBTQ students. During that year, Porterfield also led a campaign to share the stories of LGBTQ students on the front page of Georgetown Magazine, a university publication highlighting stories about students, faculty and alumni.
The LGBTQ Center officially opened its doors in August 2008 under the leadership of Sivagama Subbaraman, the first and current director of the center. Today, the center includes resources for LGBTQ students, including the Tagliabue Initiative for LGBTQ Life. The Tagliabue Initiative, funded from a gift from Chandler and Paul Tagliabue (COL ’62), who also served as chairman of the university’s board of directors from 2008 to 2015, includes Journeys, an annual LGBTQ center retreat, a discussion based initiative to explore queer identities and a series of workshops to provide LGBTQ students with a space to reflect on and engage with their identities.
Student activism drove the movement that established the LGBTQ Center and has sustained it to this day, Porterfield said.
Student involvement in movements like the one to establish the LGBTQ Center helps cultivate a culture and a community that students need, Porterfield said.
“We have to challenge students to be partners in creating the community that they want,” Porterfield said. “They are people who shape the traditions and the culture of the school.”
While student activism was the driving force behind the creation of the LGBTQ Center, only with university support could the center gain the traction and necessary funding to develop into its current form, according to Porterfield. University President John J. DeGioia’s endorsement of the LGBTQ Center in 2007 jumpstarted the process to establish the center, he said.
“What [President DeGioia] was able to do was frame the work in a way that was coherent with the core values of this institution,” Porterfield said.
Student activists need to work with the school administration if they want to create lasting change, according to Porterfield.
“Genuine, authentic process makes the roots grow deep,” Porfterfield said. “That keeps the tree up.”
DeGioia introduced the Monday event and praised the work of the LGBTQ Center in expanding during its 10 years on campus.
“A decade ago we took one step,” DeGioia said in his opening remarks. “This center is something. This community that the Center has sustained is something. Because of all of you, it is something wonderful.”
Getting students to speak up about their experiences helped cultivate a more welcoming community at Georgetown for LGTBQ students, Porterfield said, discussing the 2008 Georgetown Magazine issue that shared the stories of LGBTQ students.
“Real people talked about how it hurt to be not able to express their identity, to share their whole selves,” he said. “Storytelling is a part of how an institution knows itself, and if we can get ourselves to point where we’re listening to each other, sharing stories human-to-human, some of those seemingly hard positions become a little more flexible.”
Student activism also drives the growth of Georgetown’s community, Angela Maske (NHS ’19), who spoke at the event and is the president of H*yas for Choice, said.
“Change is embedded in this institution, in all institutions,” Maske said. “In order to realize our vision of a truly justice-oriented Georgetown, we must embrace this change with open arms.”

This fall marks the first semester of the new core science requirement for students in the School of Foreign Service.
The Class of 2022 is the first group of students subject to the new core curriculum. Accommodating the addition of a science requirement required a reduction in economics courses, major courses and the three—or more—credit courses needed to graduate.
The SFS science classes aim to explore the intersection between science and international affairs through courses including “The Science of Extinction and De-Extinction” and “Examining Crises Through the Lens of Science,” according to Mark Giordano, Science, Technology and International Affairs program director.
“We wanted to make a set of science classes that were directly oriented toward SFS students,” Giordano said in an interview with The Hoya.
For Christina Luke (SFS ’22), “The Science of Extinction and De-Extinction” was not a class she initially thought she would be interested in. After being in the class for seven weeks, Luke’s perception on science courses has shifted.
“It’s interesting subject matter that I usually would not have picked for myself and now being in the class it actually makes me want to take more SFS science classes and further delve into how science engages with the international community and international studies,” Luke said in an interview with The Hoya.
The course’s varied methods of learning, ranging from using 3D-printers to create prints of dolphin skulls to understanding how to create science-related policy briefs, is what has made the class interesting, according to Luke.
“With the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah there were so many cretaceous fossils and there was an effort to preserve the national monument because Trump wanted to open it up to privatization,” she said.  “We had to write a policy brief as if that had not already happened and it was a way to connect what we were learning to present day events.”
Danny Livingston (SFS ’22) said the connections between science and international relations in his “Examining Crises Through the Lens of Science” class is discussed using different case studies, focusing on topics like biological weapons and infectious diseases.
“It has a lot to do with international events and how different countries are responding and working together to solve these crises,” Livingston said.
Although the courses are meant to spotlight the presence of science in the international community, more emphasis could be put on the science aspect of the course, according to Livingston.
“We had one day in a lab, it would be cool if we had more actual science, more hands-on stuff,” Livingston said. “I’m a STIA major so I’ll have more experiences in the future, but I know for other students who are IPOL or IPEC majors that this could be their only exposure to science.”
Going forward, the School of Foreign Service Academic Council hopes that the SFS science classes continue to be taught by professors who are knowledgeable and passionate about their subject area to make the class interesting for all students, including those who may not wish to pursue a field relating to science, according to SFSAC Vice President Forrest Gertin (SFS ’20).
“This is something that the SFS Academic Council has been pushing for, is that any class that we are requiring you to take—even though, say you’re an IPEC major, so you’re not particularly interested in science—we want the class to be taught by someone who really knows how to teach and is one of the best teaching professors at the university,” Gertin said. “We’ve found some success in lobbying the Dean’s office so that the people who are teaching those courses are, and will continue to be in the future, the best teachers that we have at the university.”
Although the SFS science classes currently have a biology focus, as the program expands, more classes integrating aspects of chemistry, such as a class focusing on weapons of mass destruction or global health, will hopefully be added, according to Giordano.
“It’s not that science and technology issues weren’t always part of international relations, but I think that it is blatantly obvious right now its importance and not having something looked like a big gap,” Giordano said.

Controversial rapper Kanye West delivered a speech on a table at the Georgetown Apple Store last Thursday afternoon, while visiting Washington, D.C., to meet with President Donald Trump.
It was unclear if West planned to give the speech or if it was an impromptu event, Sarah Hirshorn (COL ’20), who was in the store at the time, wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“Kanye was pacing around the back of the store,” Hirshorn wrote. “A few people had their phones out to take photos and videos but the majority of people didn’t seem to care or know what was going on!”
Jack Jenkins, a national reporter for the Religion News Service who was in the store at the time, chronicled the moment on Twitter.
Apple Store patrons gathered around West with phones in hand while he gave a “keynote,” Jenkins tweeted.
West said he made a “Make America Great” hat for Trump, and showed the crowd a picture of him wearing it, Jenkins said.
The original slogan is insulting to black people, West said, according to CNN breaking news reporter Caroline Kelly.
“‘It hurts us as people, specifically black people, the idea, because we say, was America ever great for us?’” Kelly tweeted.
West declared he was heading to Africa before leaving the store, according to Jenkins.
West has delayed his forthcoming studio album “Yandhi” past its expected Sept. 29 release date and is traveling to Africa to record it. The album is set to drop on Black Friday, West said in an interview with TMZ.
Apple Store employees declined to comment on the incident, but one said that West was, “man, I think just being extra,” Jenkins tweeted.
Georgetown’s Apple Store has a history of celebrity sightings. In September, its Genius bar helped Special Counsel Robert Mueller with his MacBook Pro, according to Business Insider. In March 2017, a woman confronted Sean Spicer in the store, calling him a fascist. Back in 2015, Apple CEO Tim Cook visited the day the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus launched.
West’s impromptu speech followed his meeting with Trump in the Oval Office earlier that day. The pair discussed, among other things, North Korea, the 13th Amendment, prison reform, police brutality and crime in Chicago, according to the Oct. 11 White House transcript.
Former Cleveland Browns running back Jim Brown also attended the meeting. Brown has been noted for his conservative views, including his opposition to fellow players kneeling for the national anthem, and for his service work in inner cities with his Amer-I-Can program.
Trump lauded West for his contributions, commenting on the visibility of the meeting, according to an Oct. 11 transcript of the meeting.
“And what Kanye is doing has been incredible,” Trump said. “All over the world they’re talking about this. And I have to tell you, I had important meetings today with senators and with everything. Nobody cared. They wanted this meeting. This is the meeting.”
During the meeting, West pitched his idea for replacing Air Force One with the iPlane 1, a theoretical hydrogen-powered aircraft, which he said would bring jobs back to the United States. It is unclear if his visit to the Georgetown Apple Store is connected to his suggestion at the White House meeting that Apple should produce the iPlane.
West said at the White House meeting black people prioritize owning name brand items over land, in response to a reporter’s question on Trump’s view of the black community.
“I think that with blacks and African-Americans, we really get caught up in the idea of racism over the idea of industry. We say if people don’t have land, they settle for brands,” West said. “We want Polo-sporting Obama again. We want a brand more than we want land. Because we’ve haven’t known how it feels to actually have our own land and have ownership of our own blocks.”
West also argued that black-on-black violence is similarly dangerous to police brutality during the White House meeting.
“You know, we talk about police murders, which we definitely have to discuss, and we have to bring nobility to the police officers and make — the police officers are just like us,” West said in the White House meeting. “But there’s this whole hate-building, right?  And that’s a major thing about racial tension.”
West has drawn criticism in the past for his support of Trump. During a Sept. 29 appearance on “Saturday Night Live,” he gave an impromptu pro-Trump speech on stage after the show, while wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat. Many in the crowd booed West, though one supporter clapped, according to The Washington Post. The speech did not air.
The Oval Office meeting ended with a hug between West and Trump.
“I love this guy right here,” West said of Trump. “Let me give this guy a hug right here.”
West did not respond to a request for comment regarding his visit to the Georgetown Apple Store over Twitter.

David Green, The George Washington University’s former associate vice president of financial operations, began as Georgetown University’s chief financial officer on Oct. 15.
Green has 17 years of experience in higher education, and utilizing this expertise to serve Georgetown is one of his aims. He says he hopes to use financial planning to improve the Georgetown community and enhance Georgetown students’ university experience.
“I hope to support the Georgetown community and ensure that the university stewards its resources and budgets to best support the research, scholarship, and service to our faculty, staff, and student,” Green wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Green succeeds David Rubenstein, whose retirement last month came after 15 years serving as Georgetown’s CFO. During his tenure at Georgetown, Rubenstein advocated for the 4 percent tuition increase for the 2016-2017 academic year. This act was met with a student appealfor university leadership, including Rubenstein, to hold a town hall to discuss the causes for the tuition hike.
Georgetown’s Chief Operating Officer Geoffrey Chatas (COL ’85) expressed his enthusiasm for hiring Green in a Sept. 19 campuswide email.
“It is with great pleasure I write to share that, in consultation with our president and executive leadership team, I have appointed David B. Green as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Georgetown University,” Chatas wrote in the email.
As Georgetown’s new CFO, Green manages the university’s financial position, both in the short- and long-term.
“He will be responsible for managing all central financial functions, including accounting and financial reporting, budgeting and planning, the long-term debt portfolio and treasury services,” Chatas wrote.
According to his university profile, Green’s duties include maintaining and overseeing the internal financial operations of the university and allocating resources to the many programs on campus.
A native of the area, Green graduated from Bishop O’Connell High School in Arlington, Va., later receiving a bachelor’s degree in business from Virginia Wesleyan University and an MBA from The George Washington University. Since 2001, Green held several financial leadership positions at GWU, including head of its Financial Operations team.
Growing up close to Georgetown and later working in Washington, D.C., provided Green with the opportunity to develop a sense of Georgetown’s character and an appreciation for its Jesuit values.
“I have always admired and known Georgetown as a preeminent university,” Green wrote. “I was drawn to the university because it incorporates core values – like service to others, cura personalis, and the common good – to build upon its mission rooted in education and research.”
In addition to the Georgetown community specifically, Green values the power of higher education and the ability to witness the influence students and professors can have on other people and the world. Seeing student and professor accomplishments first-hand is part of what he enjoys about higher education, Green said.
“It’s rewarding to see a student walk across the stage at graduation years after you see them walking on a campus tour.” Green wrote. “It’s inspiring to see how groundbreaking medical research can save people’s lives.”
Outside of his work, Green devotes most of his time to his family. He and his wife, Therese, have four children who are involved in sports, and Green spends time coaching and watching them play. When he’s not with his family, Green likes to relax by playing ice hockey or soccer.
“I have always loved Georgetown and known it to be a dynamic community dedicated to teaching, research, scholarship, and service,” Green wrote. “I’m eager to join the community and maximize its financial services and resources to provide faculty, students, and staff with the excellence they deserve.”

Undocumented immigrant poets face obstacles in the literary world because of their immigration status, poet Marcelo Hernandez Castillo and assistant professor of creative writing at Oklahoma State University Janine Joseph, both undocumented immigrants, said at an event Oct. 16 in Copley Formal Lounge.
Castillo and Joseph lead the national Undocupoets Campaign, which aims to end discrimination based on immigration status in the literary community. Aminatta Forna, Lannan Foundation chair of poetics and interim director, moderated the event.
Undocupoets lobbies for the inclusion of poets without documentation in literary awards, according to Lannan fellow Elizabeth George. It has also partnered with Amazon Publishing to build the Undocupoets Fellowship, which assists undocumented writers with paying entry fees into writing competitions.
The Undocupoets Campaign, which began in 2015, helped bring immigrant authors without documentation into the mainstream literary world, but writers without documentation still face citizenship requirements for publishing, Joseph said.
“People will actually email us and say: ‘Just so you know I tried to submit my work for this particular prize and, you know, I worked on my submission for a long time and right as I was about to hit submit, I realized you could only be a citizen just to submit your work’,” Joseph said.
Literature can be a form of activism, fighting stereotypes and misperceptions about immigrants, according to Joseph. She said she hopes her book “Driving Without a License,” published in 2016, will defy her teachers’ and peers’ expectations for her as a poet.
“I realized that now, I was catering to a type of reader and a reader that was wanting for me to be more ethnic and more exotic … this book is actively resisting all of that,” Joseph said.
Castillo’s poetry emerged out of his experience as an undocumented immigrant, as writing served as an outlet to express his emotions, he said.
“I couldn’t say a lot about me and yeah, I wanted to say all of it but finally I was just tired. I was tired,” Castillo said. “It was cathartic to locate myself in a poem. Just to start there. Not even to locate the poem in a place or in a time but just to locate myself in a poem.”
Teachers’ biases and expectations surrounding themes of immigration in poetry shaped Joseph’s writing, she said. Teachers encouraged Joseph to write more about her Filipino heritage and her experience growing up in America, she said.
“[In workshop] people would ask me to put in more of the Philippines. More of your experience as someone who was born in the Philippines,” Joseph said. “I was largely educated in English so though I understand a lot of Tagalog, it seemed weird to just pick and choose which of these words am I going to switch into another language”.
The challenges with overcoming biases and discrimination that undoccumentd poets face in the literary world begin at a young age, Castillo said.
“[My brother an I] went to the flea market to go buy [my first car] and it was between this red Pontiac and this brown Ford Torres and I was 18, you know, I wanted this red Pontiac but I knew I had to get this brown sudan because it blended,” Castillo said. “That translated over into everything that I did.”
Joseph, who flew to America on a tourist visa from the Philippines, said that the media’s coverage of undocumented immigrants exacerbated the discrimination and fear she felt because of her undocumented status.
“I grew up in Southern California and pretty much every single day there was some kind of story about what was happening in the U.S.-Mexico border and what was happening in Southern California and what was happening in parts of California that I couldn’t go to because I was afraid of checkpoints,” Joseph said. “And so that shaped my understanding of who I was in the eyes of America and in the eyes of America I was someone who had crossed the border by foot.”
The obstacles undocumented immigrants face permeate all parts of life, Castillo said, describing a feeling of having constant supervision as an undocumented immigrant.
“We like to think that the border exists down in the U.S.-Mexico side but, you know, the reality is that the border, we take it with us,” Castillo said. “It’s this overwhelming, oppressive force that always exists on top of you. You think that at any moment, somebody can come.”

Today’s political divisions and partisanship in the United States originate from the fracturing of the moderate political ideology in the 1960s, Sidney M. Milkis, the distinguished teaching professor in the Department of Politics at the University of Virginia, said during an event in the Edward B. Bunn, S.J. Intercultural Center auditorium Oct. 15.
Richard Boyd, the director of the Tocqueville Forum for Political Understanding, moderated the event, titled “What Happened to the Vital Center: The Fracturing of America and the Rise of Donald Trump.” The event’s lecturer, Milkis, authored multiple books about political parties in the United States, including “The Great Society and the High Tide of Liberalism,” and currently teaches American government.
While modern modes of mass communication, such as Twitter, exacerbate the divisions in American politics, divisions originated with the destruction of the center in American politics during the 1960s, Milkis said, referring to what historian and intellectual Arthur Schlesinger Jr. called the tearing apart of the vital center of American politics in 1960s.
“The disruptive 2016 election, and the first two years of the Trump presidency, did not come out of nowhere. In fact, the current circus maximus is the culmination of developments that have been festering for more than five decades,” Milkis said. “The contemporary battles between Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, represent the legacy of the tearing apart of what Arthur Schlesinger Jr. called the vital center of American politics during the 1960s.”
Liberal movements in the 1960s like the civil rights movements, the women’s rights and the anti-war movements pulled apart the center of American politics by criticizing the New Deal state, which expanded national administrative power through bipartisanship, for encouraging indifference to the injustices occurring around the world, according to Milkis.
“Most critics of partisan rancor blame the republicans for fracturing America, but really it was the leftists, especially the leaders of the civil rights and anti-war movement, who first threw American politics off-center, who rejected the working arrangements of the by-then fatigued new deal state that appeared to insulate American government from public accountability,” Milkis said.
The advocacy movements in the late 1960s gave rise to more militant conservatism of politicians such as Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) causing conservatives to stray further from the center and to reject the moderate republicanism that President Dwight Eisenhower advocated, Milkis said.
“Security from domestic violence, no less than from foreign aggression, Goldwater told to the GOP delegates, is the most elementary and fundamental purpose of any government,” Milkis said. “A government that cannot fulfill that purpose is a government that cannot long command the loyalty of its citizens. So Goldwater preached the gospel of law and order that would become a rallying cry for the new right.”
The 2016 presidential election exacerbated partisan divisions, Milkis said. Trump followed in Goldwater’s and President Richard Nixon’s footsteps, presenting himself as the law and order candidate and contributing to the Republican parties’ shift right. Republican politicians’ claim that they will establish security and order, which reflects how the Democrats and the Republicans have moved away from debating the role of a large national government and toward defending one of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s four freedoms: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from fear, and freedom from want, according to Milkis.
“Put simply, the liberals are devoted to the welfare state, they embrace freedom from want, and conservatives embellish the national security state,” Milkis said. “Conservatives embrace freedom from fear. And the politics of fear is at the heart of Trumpism. All this suggests that Trump is a symptom, not a cause, of America’s discontent.”
While Trump pulled the Republican party more to the right, other politicians such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also pulled the Democratic party further from the center, according to Milkis.
“Even though his revolution fell short, Bernie’s remarkable campaign made its impact on the election,” Milkis said. “Hillary Clinton and the Democrats were pushed far more to the left than they would have been in the absence of the Sanders’ campaign on education, on trade, on healthcare policy.”

Iran’s Green Movement in 2009 represents the influence youth can have on a country’s political development, modern Middle East historian Pouya Alimagham said at an event Oct. 3 in the Intercultural Center. 
The Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding hosted Alimagham’s discussion, which examined state ideology and popular protest in Iran since the Iranian revolution in 1979 concluded with the overthrow of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. Alimagham is a Middle Eastern historian specializing in modern Iran, Iraq and the Levant with a focus on revolutions, political Islam and post-Islamism.  
Understanding the Iranian government’s fusion of theocracy and democracy is essential to understanding Iran today, Alimagham said. Under the current system, the president, the parliament and the Assembly of Experts are elected. Religious forces maintain sovereignty through the supreme leader, the head of state, the judiciary and the Guardian Council, which has the power to veto legislation and decide who runs in presidential, parliamentary and assembly elections. 
The Green Movement began when the Iranian government demanded popular participation in elections. In 2009, the government sought to alleviate this tension by encouraging public electoral participation. At the time, restrictions imposed on voting prevented popular participation, specifically youth participation, which led to the rise of conservative parties, Alimagham said. Such restrictions, particularly those on social media, were reduced in 2009 to bolster participation. 
“When the youth don’t participate in elections, typically what ends up happening is a right-wing party comes to power,” Alimagham said. 
The Green Movement was an important opening for Iranians, Alimagham said, as it was one of the first times individual smartphones and SMS messaging allowed the masses to broadcast their resistance to the outside world. The Green Movement was “really the first modern uprising in terms of the means it used to convey it to the world,” Alimagham said.
The state’s response during the Green Movement — deploying security forces and seizing control of the streets — escalated popular political activity, Alimagham said. 
The evolution of the Green Movement, according to Alimagham, represents Post-Islamism, a recognition that politics rather than religion provides for welfare in this life, according to The Guardian.  
“If the Iranian Movement was a symptom of the times, then the Green Uprising will represent a new trend,” Alimagham said.
 The 1979 Iranian revolution marked a period of Islamic revival, while the Green Movement, Alimagham furthered, will show what happens when Islam achieves power. Moreover, the movement has grown to encompass other resistance groups, including those involving women, youth, and religious and ethnic minorities.  
“The Green Uprising is an umbrella movement,” Alimagham said.

You claim that “At the time, restrictions imposed on voting prevented popular participation”. Can you elaborate on what these restrictions were?
