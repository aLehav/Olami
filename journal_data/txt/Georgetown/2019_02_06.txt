Four presidential candidates for the Georgetown University Student Association executive shared their varying policy approaches at Tuesday night’s presidential debate, expanding on issues ranging from the GU272 referendum and student advocacy recognition to the flaws of GUSA.
Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20), Nicki Gray (NHS ’20), Sina Nemazi (COL ’21) and Ryan Zuccala (MSB ’20) detailed their policies on Title IX regulations and tuition during the event. The executive election is set for Friday, Feb. 8.
In his opening statement, Nemazi discredited his opponents for their lack of previous GUSA experience and policy proposals that he said were unrealistic.
“We’re just offering very tangible goals that will make GUSA relevant and actually impact the lives of students,” Nemazi said. “We all want to lower tuition, we all want to make dining better, but actions speak louder than words.”
Zuccala responded in his opening statement that the simplicity of his campaign’s policies are a strength and a result of his GUSA outsider status.
“My answer to him, ‘Why is GUSA inefficient?’ is because GUSA has all these insiders that introduce 20-point, 30-point plans and really don’t get anything accomplished,” Zuccala said. “We just have three points, they’re pretty simple and I think we can accomplish all three of them.”
In her introduction, Gray said her campaign raises relevant student concerns that cannot be ignored. 
“I initially decided to run because I saw issues that needed to be addressed on this campus,” Gray said. “I am staying in this fight because I believe those issues are too important to go unresolved.”
Francis began the debate by describing how he and his running mate Aleida Olvera (COL ’20) plan to be open and honest about their achievements and shortcomings.
“We want to make sure that we are very transparent with you,” Francis said. “We want you to know where we are failing, and where we are getting our work from, and also how we’re succeeding.”
As the debate progressed, candidates offered policy proposals they plan to push if elected. Nemazi’s campaign aims to create a Zen Den meditation room in Lauinger Library for students, while Gray intends to advocate for pro bono legal representation for students pursuing Title IX cases. Francis pushed for the creation of a women’s and gender studies department, and Zuccala’s policy focused on improved responses to facilities requests and increasing the value of student meal plans.
Gray and Zuccala also shared their contrasting views on the upcoming GU272 referendum set for April. The vote will give students the option to support or reject the creation of a semesterly reconciliation fee that would go toward a fund to benefit descendants of the 272 enslaved individuals sold by the Maryland Society of Jesus in 1838 to financially sustain Georgetown.
In reference to the reconciliation fee, Gray argued students have a responsibility to acknowledge the university’s previous wrongs. 
“We all attend a university that was built in large part from the work of enslaved people, and it is our duty as members of this community to recognize that,” Gray said to loud applause from the crowd. “It’s not an ill that you or I committed, but it is something that actively affects our time here.”
In response to a question from the Georgetown Heckler, an on-campus satirical publication, Gray also said she would install 272 benches across campus in memory of the number of slaves sold.
Zuccala argued against a mandatory fee and said his platform includes an “opt-out” option for the GU272 fund.
“Georgetown itself made the mistake, not the current students that attend. As a result they should not be forced to pay for the mistakes of their school,” Zuccala said. “The school should be making sacrifices, not the students.”
The candidates also spoke about the importance of incorporating the voices of student advocates in their policy and legislation discussions if elected. 
Francis advocated for more student activist input in GUSA policies and legislation.
“Personally, I believe that student activism should be better incorporated into the policy pillars and chairs,” Francis said. “The activists are the best people because they are the ones doing the work.”
Gray said she aims to serve as an avenue for student activists to achieve their policy goals.
“Like so many of us have said, the job of the GUSA executive is to be an advocacy wing for the student body,” Gray said. “Allowing students and allowing the people who are trying to make change to do it in a way that is most productive for them and for their goals is absolutely my goal.”
Nemazi’s campaign seeks to work with student advocates by supporting their ongoing policy efforts.
“A lot of getting advocacy groups involved is actually pushing forward a platform that these advocacy group are also interested in pushing forward,” Nemazi said. “When it comes to our platform for standing up for women’s rights and feminine hygiene products, there are already student advocacy groups on campus who are trying to do that, so we would work with them.”
Despite acknowledging the flaws within GUSA, especially amid the student-led Abolish GUSA campaign, the candidates also spoke about the strengths and accomplishments of previous administrations.
Francis said many of GUSA’s previous achievements have gone overlooked, and this oversight gives the organization a bad reputation.
“I think GUSA does a lot of great work that normally a lot of people just don’t know about or other people might have taken credit for,” Francis said. “I was recently speaking with a GUSA senator and I realized that the GoCard came about because of GUSA.”
Nemazi commended the current GUSA President Juan Martinez (SFS ’20) and Vice President Kenna Chick (SFS ’20) for their commitment to amplifying student voices but highlighted the need for the administration to be held accountable for its advocacy promises. 
“I really have the utmost respect for Juan and Kenna for coming in such a disillusioned time and holding everyone together,” Nemazi said. “They did a lot of great work in the sense of empowering advocacy groups to do what they’re best fit to do.”
During audience questions, one student asked Gray to shed light on the reason her former running mate, Sam Appel (COL ’20), dropped out of the campaign. Gray replied she and Appel reached the decision that he should step down from the campaign independently. Gray did not share specific reasonings behind Appel’s departure.
“My former running mate decided on his own to leave this campaign because he was no longer a good candidate for the vice presidency, and that was a decision I made independently also,” Gray said.
The GUSA election commission organized the debate, which was hosted in the Healey Family Student Center Great Room. Representatives of campus media outlets, including The Hoya, the Georgetown Voice, the Georgetown Heckler and the Georgetown Review asked questions, along with Hayley Grande (COL ’21), chair of the GUSA senate’s finance and appropriations committee; outgoing executives Martinez and Chick; and students, both on Twitter and in the audience.

Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called for a second referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom at an event hosted by the School of Foreign Service on Monday. Sturgeon renewed calls for Scottish independence because of rifts between the Scottish and British Parliaments exacerbated by differing views on Brexit.
As the U.K.’s exit from the European Union, scheduled for March 29, draws nearer with no agreement in sight, Scotland must decide how to deal with a forced removal from the EU. However, a majority of Scots who participated in the 2016 Brexit referendum voted to remain in the EU. Sturgeon, who as first minister is the head of the Scottish Government, said the disagreement leads her to believe Scotland’s interests would be best served if it were an independent country.
“I will set out my thoughts and the timing of another independence referendum in the next few weeks, once the terms of Brexit have become clearer,” Sturgeon said. “But amid the confusion and the uncertainty of Brexit, one thing is clearer, I think, than ever: Scotland’s national interests are not being served by a Westminster system that too often treats Scotland an afterthought, or too often sees our interests as not being material.”
Sturgeon is the first woman to hold the office of first minister in Scotland, ascending to the position in 2014. Sturgeon spoke in Riggs at the Feb. 4 event, which was co-hosted by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security.
While the U.K. as a whole voted in favor of leaving the EU with 52 percent of the vote, a majority of Northern Ireland and Scotland voted to stay. The voices of the 62 percent of Scottish voters who voted against leaving the EU have been disregarded by the U.K., according to Sturgeon.
“The U.K. government could have led discussions with the devolved nations and others about how to leave the EU. It could have considered and made compromises that took account of the differing views across different parts of the United Kingdom,” Sturgeon said.  “But instead of that, the vote in Scotland has been ignored, and over the two-and-a-half years since it took place, our interests have been sidelined.” 
The U.K. held the referendum to decide whether to leave the EU on June 23, 2016, with 71 percent voter turnout. The 52 percent vote in favor of leaving the EU was attributed to factors such as economic stagnancy within the EU and rise in U.K. nationalism, according to BBC News.
The U.K. Parliament rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan 10 weeks prior to the scheduled departure date. May survived a vote of no confidence in Parliament on Jan. 16 that could have removed her from the role of prime minister; however, the 325 to 306 rejection of the no-confidence motion showed diminishing support for May, according to The New York Times.
The U.K. Parliament’s lack of reception to Scottish concerns undermines the foundation of governance in the U.K., according to Sturgeon.
“It throws up the fundamental question about the way in which political decision-making is exercised in the United Kingdom, and indeed about the nature of the United Kingdom itself,” Sturgeon said. 
Scottish independence movements have long sought for removing Scotland from the U.K. and  become an independent country. Fifty-five percent of Scottish voters opted against leaving the U.K. in a 2014 referendum, with the uncertain ramifications of Scottish independence on its membership in the EU a major topic of discussion leading up to the November vote. Now, Scotland’s support for staying in the EU has fueled renewed requests for Scottish independence. 
Arguments that leaving the EU will put more money in the pocketbooks of British citizens are unfounded, according to Sturgeon.
“By impeding free trade in order to end freedom of movement, the U.K. is in the bizarre, absurd position of doing something that will harm the U.K. and Scotland in order to do something else that will harm the U.K. and Scotland — that is the absurdity of the position we find ourselves in,” Sturgeon said.
Brexit would create serious economic implications for the U.K., as they would no longer be able to participate in the EU’s single market, resulting in a £125 billion loss. In addition, leaving the EU could hurt the U.K.’s credibility in the international economy, according to the Economist.
Although Brexit will decrease immigration by ending freedom of movement between the U.K. and the rest of the EU, Sturgeon does not believe ending the freedom of movement policy is a good course of action, especially not for Scotland, whose aging population benefits highly from foreigners who come to Scotland for study and work.
Immigration contributes to cultural diversity and is necessary to support the aging Scottish population, according to Sturgeon.
“Immigration has been good for our culture, our economy, and our society as a whole,” Sturgeon said. “Without it, our population will start to decline, and everyone knows the consequences of that.”
The results of the Brexit referendum were evidence of an economic anxiety that’s better addressed through measures reducing income inequality, Sturgeon said. 
“Brexit is the wrong response to inequality, because it’s likely to make people’s living standards worse rather than better,” Sturgeon said. “Scotland’s economic strategy has, for several years now, emphasized so strongly the notion that of inclusive growth: growth which benefits everyone, and growth to which everyone has the opportunity to contribute.”

Following several months of heating concerns in the New South Residence Hall Office, several RHO student workers filed a petition to the Office of Residential Living urging it to address these concerns and work with the Office of Planning and Facilities Management to develop potential solutions for the heating issue.
The recorded temperature of the RHO was over 20 degrees lower than the temperature control range of 68 to 76 degrees Fahrenheit recommended by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor, prompting over 60 student workers to sign the petition.
Students sent the petition to Residential Living and university administrators last Friday. It received a response from Residential Living staff members within two hours.
New South RHO Assistant Emily Schluper (COL ’21) said the students decided to draft the petition because working in such conditions was becoming unbearable.
“We were just kind of getting fed up because it got to the point where, when I went to work, I had to bring gloves and scarves because it was almost colder inside the RHO just sitting there working,” Schluper said.
The demands outlined in the petition are not unreasonable, according to New South RHO Assistant Allie Williams (SFS ’19), who spearheaded the petition. (Full disclosure: Williams previously served on The Hoya’s editorial board.)
“It’s pretty straightforward—all we are asking for is that Residential Living complies with laws and provide us with a healthy and safe workplace that meets the minimum temperature standard,” Williams wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The petition outlined a few demands for Residential Living, which included purchasing more space heaters and providing New South RHO management and staff with regular updates from Facilities about any findings related to the heating and insulation of the New South lobby.
Residential Living responded to the petition, assuring students that they are working on a solution with Facilities.
“The health and wellness of students is a top priority,” Vice President of Facilities and Planning Management Ben Kuo wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We take their concerns very seriously and have taken prompt action to ensure a safe and comfortable temperature in New South.”
Following the demands of the petition, Residential Living has installed a large heater in the lobby area to provide supplemental heating. Residential Living also recommends that residents avoid deploying the electronic doors — which allows for excess cold air to enter the lobby — unless for accessibility purposes.
While student workers appreciate the university’s current efforts to address the heating issue, they are frustrated over the lack of response from Residential Living prior to the release of the petition, according to Williams.
Although Residential Living has started to address the heating issue in the short term, determining how a more long-term solution can be put in place is difficult, according to New South RHO Assistant Andy Marquez (SFS ’21).
“They have been trying to help us with short-term solutions by giving us more heaters, but the long-term solution is, at the moment, complicated and ambiguous because this type of solution requires changes in the infrastructure of the building,” Marquez wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The RHO temperature concerns have been brought up with Residential Living several times over the course of the past few months and have only now been fully addressed, New South RHO Assistant Andrei Bonano (COL ’19) said 
“We’ve been in communication with the Office of Residential Living since October, and it’s kind of frustrating that it takes us to make a petition and to send something to departmental heads in order to get some action,” Bonano said.
Many RHO workers feel Residential Living must now meet students halfway and begin addressing issues that are affecting their student workers, according to Williams.
“RHO workers have done everything we can to communicate with Residential Living,” Williams wrote. “The onus is now on them, as our employer, to protect our health and safety and communicate what they are doing to meet legal standards going forward.”
Residential Living has assured students it will communicate with them on a more frequent basis to keep them updated on the status of the RHO heating issue.
“We are continuing to monitor the temperature, investigate sources of the problem, and address the issue. We will provide updates to the New South community as we continue making progress,” Kuo wrote in an email to The Hoya.

Georgetown University submitted its formal comment regarding proposed Title IX regulations to the U.S. Department of Education on Jan. 31, following months of student activism and input.
The final submission comes after Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and Vice President for Institutional Diversity and Equity Rosemary Kilkenny shared the draft comment in an email to the student body Jan. 23. The university collected anonymous feedback to the comment through an online form.
The proposed regulation changes do not uphold a fair, just and supportive grievance process, the the comment reads.
“Georgetown is concerned that the proposed regulations create an overly legalistic process that will unnecessarily restrain reporting, traumatize students, lead to less accountability, and create inequities,” the comment reads.
Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos released proposed changes to Title IX regulations in November 2018 that include altering the definition of sexual harassment from actions “severe or pervasive” to “severe and pervasive,” a narrowing of requirements.  
The comment specifically highlights the redefinition of sexual harassment and the introduction of cross-examination of both accused students and accusers during Title IX hearings as unwelcome changes to Title IX regulations.
More than 370 community members and student advocates influenced the university’s final comment, according to university spokesperson Matt Hill.
“While the university’s comment cannot effectively do justice to every thoughtful and compelling remark from our community, many individual viewpoints, along with our core Jesuit values, were essential in shaping our comment,” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The university held listening sessions in December where students voiced how they hoped the university would respond to the proposed Title IX regulation changes. The administration waited to formally comment on the Title IX changes until it had gathered student feedback from all 11 listening sessions. Administrators then rebuked the proposed changes at the Students Taking Action against Interpersonal Violence town hall on Jan. 15.
Chair of Georgetown’s women’s and gender studies department You-Me Park expressed appreciation for the university’s comment.
“The University comment is thorough and great,” Park wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I am proud to work for the University that formulated such well-thought-out and unequivocal responses to the new regulations.”
The Department of Education’s focus on the monetary benefits of implementing the changes reveals its flawed priorities, Park wrote. 
“We need to make it clear that our students’ wellbeing and health come before monetary gain, whatever the amount, and that any changes to our policies will be undertaken to improve processes and not simply to save money,” Park wrote.
The Department of Education estimates implementing the regulation changes will save schools $286.4 million to $367.7 million over the next ten years because universities will not have to conduct investigations.
The regulation should be re-evaluated to be more inclusive and equitable, according to WGST major Tina Tehrani (COL ’19). As it stands, Title IX requires that schools do not discriminate against students on the basis of sex, but does not extend to discrimination against pregnant or parenting students or discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.
“I believe the current changes cause more damage than progress,” Tehrani wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “The changes should not go against the entire basis of Title IX. No discrimination means no discrimination.”
Though hundreds participated in forming the university’s comment, many community members submitted separate comments as well. Park also invited students in the WGST senior capstone class, a seminar only open to seniors pursuing a major or minor in WGST, to write a joint letter and publish their own public comment.
The WGST seniors’ comment was submitted to the federal register during the Department of Education’s 60-day public comment period after its Nov. 16 release of its proposed regulation changes. Any individual or group could submit public comments online or by mail for review by the Department of Education. The comment period opened Nov. 29 and officially ended Jan. 30.
The WGST seniors’ letter raised four concerns with the proposed changes. The letter said that the proposed regulation prioritizes money over student well-being, creates loopholes that limit which cases are investigated, neglects to apply to K-12 education and allows for religious exemptions which could disproportionately affect pregnant, parenting or LGBTQ students.
STAIV, a student group advocating for the university to reform its responses to instances of sexual misconduct on campus, also encouraged its members to submit their own comments.
The group held a “Notice and Comment Party” on Jan. 24 in cooperation with GUSA’s Sexual Assault and Student Safety policy team to provide a casual gathering where students could eat pizza while learning how to write a comment.
On Jan. 25, STAIV released a Google form on its Facebook, by which students could write their personal comments on the Title IX changes for STAIV to formalize and submit to the Department of Education on the students’ behalf.
STAIV has engaged in long-term advocacy against the Title IX changes, and has had several meetings with university administrators, according to STAIV member Hanna Chan (COL ’19). These meetings led to the university’s 11 Title IX listening sessions and the STAIV town hall, which facilitated discussion surrounding Title IX and interpersonal violence at Georgetown.
Chan, a Women and Gender Studies major, received help and guidance on her advocacy from Park, who wrote that she is pleased with work of her students who are seniors.
“Our senior class will continue to lead and reflect student activism on campus,” Park wrote.

Georgetown University’s plans to build a solar power facility in Maryland that would clear-cut 240 acres of forest have drawn calls from local environmentalists to change the location of the proposed solar panels.
While the project would contribute to the university’s goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by the 2019-20 academic year, it would also deforest 240 acres of land that act as a carbon sink, preventing the gas from going into the atmosphere.
Clearing the forest to install solar panels may tarnish popular support for renewable energy, according to Bonnie Bick, an activist in the Southern Maryland chapter of the Sierra Club, a national environmental preservation organization.
“This is counterproductive for solar in general because it gives solar a bad name,” Bick said in an interview with The Hoya. “This is not where solar should be located. And by locating it here, they are doing a disservice to solar because the negative impacts are unacceptable.”
A university spokesperson declined to comment on whether the university was changing the location of the solar project. 
Georgetown first partnered with Origis Energy USA, a solar energy company, in September 2017 to build the La Plata, Maryland 32.5-megawatt off-site solar power system. The panels would produce 75,000 megawatt hours of power each year and provide for about 50 percent of the university’s energy needs in the 2019-20 school year, according to a company press release. Origis estimates the project will be operational by June 2019.
Georgetown should have included student voices more in the development of its solar project, as many are unsure of their support of the placement of the panels, according to Samantha Panchèvre (SFS ’19), Georgetown University Student Association senior sustainability chair.
“If the University had been intentional about engaging students and communicating the rationale for choosing La Plata as well as the benefits this specific site would bring, then I think students would feel a lot more comfortable with this project — but most of us are in the dark, so we can’t fully support it,” Panchèvre wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Georgetown Environmental Leaders Network, managed by the GUSA Sustainability division, is set to hold a public forum to gather more student perspectives on the project Feb. 10.
Georgetown is committed to halving its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and will conduct ongoing reviews of the project, according to a university spokesperson.
“We’re engaging a third party expert to assess the existing, extensive studies and review of this offsite solar project to ensure it is conducted in an ecologically responsible way,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The project’s reduction in greenhouse gas emissions would be similar to planting 429,000 trees, the spokesperson wrote. This estimate was found using the Environmental Protection Agency’s emissions reduction calculator.
While installing renewable energy is important, efforts should not be implemented without regard to other environmental considerations, Sierra Club member and nearby resident Ben Hance wrote in an email obtained to GU Fossil Free, a club pushing for the university to divest from non-renewable energy,
“Renewable energy is the future, but its growth must be the result of a thoughtful process that accounts for more than just the carbon balance sheet for electricity usage,” Hance wrote in an email obtained by The Hoya.
The area has been named “the best of the best” by the Department of Natural Resources, and was designated as an Important Bird Area for its role as a habitat for the state’s rarest plants and animals, according to the Maryland Audubon Society, a group that works to protect the habitats of birds.
Origis plans to permanently limit use of more than half of the 537 acres it purchased for conservation purposes. The company also plans to conserve that land through building a habitat and protecting waterways, according to the company’s proposal to the Maryland Public Service  Commission.
Origis chose the location because the land was unfarmed, the company could gain a permit to install solar panels and power lines were nearby, according to Origis spokesperson Glenna Wiseman.
The proposal was unanimously approved by the Charles County Board of Appeals, though a motion for reconsideration was denied, Wiseman wrote in an email to The Hoya.
As part of the agreement, Origis plans to contribute to scholarships for low-income undergraduate students with demonstrated financial need.
The project is critical to Georgetown’s sustainability and carbon emissions goals, according to Robin Morey, vice president of Planning and Facilities Management.
“This strategic partnership with Origis supports Georgetown’s carbon footprint reduction goals while providing long term energy price stability,” Morey said in a Sept. 18 statement announcing the project.
Still, Georgetown should change the location of this solar project due to the environmental harms of deforesting land, Lisa Redding, a resident near the planned site who has been vocal of her opposition, wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“Georgetown University can direct their contractor to find a better location,” Redding wrote. “It may be cheap for Origis to destroy forests but the loss to society is not.”

A group of students that created a program to aid relief efforts for natural disasters won $500 at the fourth annual Hoya Hacks, which lasted from Friday evening until Sunday afternoon. 
The 36-hour event invites undergraduates from any university to compete on teams to design projects and programs consistent with a particular theme. This year, students were encouraged to create projects focused on social impact. The competition offers multiple, more specific subdivisions of the general theme of the event, allowing students to tailor their projects to specific goals.
The winning group, The Plastic Chickens, created Project Reach, a program aiming to make it easier for potential donors to find charities and resources for those affected by natural disasters, according to the team’s website. 
The Plastic Chickens is comprised of Alyssa Schilke, a junior at Loyola University Maryland; Sarah Kiel, a junior at Lehigh University; Collins Nji, a freshman at Frederick Community College and Adeeb Abbas, a freshman at Drexel University. Though many groups come to the competition formed already, the winning group met for the first time and formed at Hoya Hacks.
The project originated from the group’s desire to help those who were eager to provide for people in need, according to Nji.
“We know in Chicago, it’s so cold, and hospitals must be really overworked,” Nji said. “It all comes down to wanting to help people who you want to help but don’t know how. It’s hard when you have the resources and money and want to help people but don’t know how you can help.” 
The website works by connecting people with charities, allowing them to track organizations by location and donate money. 
“You can get close to the disasters happening. There’s a map in our program, where you can find the disaster and find charities where you can send money,” Kiel said.
The team competed in Hoya Hacks simply to enjoy a new experience, according to Nji. 
“Honestly, it was more about just having fun. It was a learning experience, where we all learned something new related to web development and helping people in need,” Nji said. “This event is about working on a team in general, and also just having fun.”
Though proud of their finished work, the team ran into major problems after a glitch caused their entire program to stop working, according to Nji. 
“We had made the whole application by 3:30 a.m., when I went to sleep. I woke up around 7:15, and I came back, did some minor changes, and the whole application broke,” Nji said. “We left 39 minutes to submission, and we literally figured out the problem five minutes before the submission deadline.” 
One of the virtues of this particular hack-athon is the fact that students from multiple universities can meet for the first time and collaborate on a project for 36 hours together, according to co-director of Hoya Hacks Brandon Herren (COL ’21). Hoya Hacks reaches out to students at other universities by reaching out to student computer science organizations, Herren said. 
Hoya Hacks was attended by around 250 people and sponsored by companies including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, IBM, Verizon and Google, according to Herren. Representatives from major sponsors attended the event and provided insight to student hackers, Herren said. Participants in the event also had the opportunity to network with and have their resumes reviewed by sponsors of the event, some of which were prepared to offer internships to participants.
The hack-athon finds many of its participants through connections its established at universities around the country, according to co-director Aleida Olvera (COL ’20).
“We reach out to departments at other schools and their communication services,” Olvera said. “We contact every school in the D.C. area and the big schools on the East Coast. We have an established presence here in D.C. People know that Georgetown has a hack-athon and are interested in what it is.” 
Hack-athons have been around for around 14 years, with the first hack-athon taking place in Calgary, Canada. The goal of a hack-athon is to bring programmers and designers together to complete a functional project in the time allotted. The Bay Area, which is home to companies such as Google and Apple, hosts hundreds of hack-athons. Hoya Hacks was founded four years ago to bring the culture of hack-athons to Georgetown, according to Herren. 
“I’m personally from the Bay Area — I grew up in a culture of hack-athons,” Herren said. “We kind of wanted to bring the same kind of spirit to Georgetown. We wanted to give opportunities to all of these people who came to make projects and make them happen.”
Correction: This article has been updated on Feb. 8 to correct the name of Plastic Chickens team member Collins Nji.
