Nearly two weeks after Jack Jr.’s official departure from campus, the Bulldog Advisory Committee has chosen a new dog to replace the former mascot-in-training.
The bulldog, born June 29, was offered to the university by breeders Janice and Marcus Hochstetler, who donated J.J. last year.
The administration discussed the option of this new dog with the BAC, which Jack and J.J.’s caretaker Fr. Christopher Steck, S.J., formed late last year before any word of J.J.’s removal, through a conference call earlier this week. The collaborative decision came after a strong student and alumni response to the unclear process leading up to the university’s decision to remove J.J. this summer and Steck’s August op-ed in The Hoya calling for the administration to incorporate the committee in future mascot decisions.
“It was very sensitive. They kept coming back to us to ask what the right decisions were to make,” said Georgetown University Student Association Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14), who sits on the BAC and is a student dog-walker for the Jack Crew. “Part of announcing it today was making sure people know what’s happening this time.”
Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh emphasized that the BAC was responsible for the final decision to pursue the opportunity to bring another bulldog to campus as well as the time-sensitive nature of the decision.
“There’s this tiny window where we had this opportunity, but we needed to decide now if we wanted to pursue it,” Pugh said.
Details about the dog’s arrival on campus, such as a prospective timeline or nickname for the future mascot, have not yet been set, but BAC members hope that the lessons learned from J.J., whose departure stemmed partly from an incident in which he bit a child last fall, will ensure a smooth process with the new bulldog.
“A lot of the things that happened that led directly to J.J.’s departure — the incident — it’s an accident. It’s something you can’t predict,” said BAC faculty representative Diana Owen, an associate professor in the Culture, Communication and Technology program. “After having the BAC and the lessons we’ve learned from the way this was handled, I’m very hopeful that there will be a more transparent process going forward.”
Hoya Blue President Joe Fiorica (COL ’14), a BAC member, agreed.
“The concerns with J.J. were kind of isolated to him specifically and not a general trend. This is the only one that’s caused an issue like this,” Fiorica said. “While obviously concerns are there and we’re extra careful now, I don’t think there’s any worry it’ll be the exact same thing all over again because we kind of learned from the past.”
J.J. is now living with a family with experience raising bulldogs close to campus — a move that is still questionable to some and that BAC members hope will inform future decisions.
“I personally had tremendous problems with the way J.J.’s dismissal was handled,” Owen said. “Was it the right decision? I don’t know. But I think right now, J.J.’s in a happy place and we have a new puppy and we’re on the way to having this more open process.”
Owen said that this summer’s events prompted a larger discussion of the mascot tradition and theBAC’s role.
“Sometimes it takes a really big, blown-up incident like this to make people aware of a larger issue,” she said.

The familiar complaint of dropped cell phone calls in Burleith and Darnall Hall will be eased next summer when a Verizon cell phone tower will be installed on the roof of Leavey Center.
The university is currently in the process of obtaining a construction permit from the D.C. municipal government to begin construction of the tower, which is expected to be completed by July 2014. The tower will consist of a set of antennae that are four feet high.
“Verizon Wireless is working with Georgetown University to expand our 4G LTE network coverage on campus to provide students, faculty, medical center staff and patients, as well as the greater Georgetown community, with the best possible wireless coverage,” Verizon spokesperson Melanie Ortel wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Verizon Wireless will pay the cost of installing the antennas and will also pay Georgetown for the use of university property.
“Having these antennas at Georgetown is a total win for the Georgetown community,” Chief Information Officer Lisa Davis said.
The construction of the tower is intended to alleviate the poor signal many Verizon customers receive on campus. According to Davis, the Verizon signal is the weakest of all mobile carriers at Georgetown.
“In some places it’s fine, [but] in general, the service is pretty bad,” Kelli Foy (SFS ’16) said.
Talks between Verizon and the university have been going on for several years. Davis said she prioritized this project when she became chief information officer in January 2012.
“So many of us have Verizon as a vendor,” Davis said. “Any opportunity to increase coverage with any of the vendors is a welcome opportunity.”
There are no plans, however, to install cell towers for other mobile service providers.
“There really hasn’t been a need or requirement from the AT&T or Sprint perspective,” Davis said.
The university will receive $22,000 in revenue and spend no money to complete this project. The surrounding neighbors will also receive a noticeable increase in mobile coverage.
The Verizon tower is part of University Information Services’ five-year modernization plan to increase the university’s capacity for mobile devices, which has focused on Wi-Fi, virtual computing and network connection upgrades since its early 2013 launch.
The network connection upgrade will increase the university’s data transmission capacity by 1,000 percent, and the private cloud upgrade will save the university $700,000.

Hannan Ahmad says 
February 19, 2018 at 9:45 am
Installation of a cell tower requires the roof to be very sturdy; a professional roofer should come to inspect the roofs. Due to urbanization in popular areas there are no locations left other than roof tops for the installation of cell tower and gardens.

Students across all majors will begin to see changes to their writing curriculum this year as part of a transition before writing requirements are completely revamped next fall.
The proposal, passed in February 2013 by the Main Campus Executive Faculty, approves changes to the Humanities and Writing core requirements as well as the treatment of writing across all academic departments.
“We spent about five months really finishing the process of a conversation that has been going on for several years about how to do a better job preparing students at Georgetown as writers,” Director of Writing Curriculum Initiatives Sherry Linkon said.
The first major change, to go into effect in fall 2014, will be the renaming of “Humanities and Writing I” to the “Writing and Culture Seminar,” a small, first-year writing seminar capped at 15 students.
“Right now, only a little more than half of students take the first-year writing course,” Linkon said. “We believe because writing is just so essential that everyone should be exposed to that course and that students who are already pretty good writers really benefit from having someone pay attention to them.”
Currently, students must complete both a “Humanities and Writing I” course and a course that satisfies the more general “Humanities and Writing II” requirement. Students who receive a score of 4 or 5 on Advanced Placement exams in English typically place out of one or both classes.
“Humanities and Writing II” will become a humanities distribution course, allowing students to choose courses from the art and theater or performance studies departments to fulfill their requirements. Students can already take an English or foreign language course for the “Humanities and Writing II” requirement.
Linkon hopes to eventually change requirements so that only a 5 on the AP exam would exempt students from the “Humanities and Writing II” requirement. To fulfill that, however, would require hiring three full-time writing faculty. The university has already hired two new faculty members to help teach the new “Writing and Culture” seminar.
“We’ve not yet been able to find the money to hire the faculty that we need to do that. It’s on the provost’s radar to do this. We’ll get there at some point,” Linkon said.
Writing requirement changes, however, are not limited to “Humanities and Writing” requirements and will affect departments across the university. Part of the proposal was an integrated writing core that will become part of the Georgetown core by fall 2015.
“We’re asking every academic program, every major to have a conversation and think about what students need as writers in their field,” Linkon said. “It will be very rare that any program will add a course to fill this requirement.”
An Integrated Writing Advisory Committee, which includes professors from all four undergraduate schools, was created to ease the transition into the new requirement.
German professor Heidi Byrnes — who serves on the committee — said that the committee will be involved in discussions with Linkon and department heads throughout the coming year.
“I think the push for this academic year will be to encourage all departments to have that kind of internal discussions and begin to lay out its plans with regard to how it will foster the development of writing abilities in this discipline,” Byrnes said. “The committee would be involved in helping to facilitate that kind of discussion within departments.”
Professors across several science departments took part in a “Writing and Disciplines” pilot program this past summer during the Teaching, Learning and Innovation Summer Institute organized by the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship.
“It’s something we’ve been talking about for years,” said Heidi Elmendorf, a co-director of undergraduate studies for the biology department who took part in the TLISI workshop this summer. “Our students do a lot of writing — we had writing expectations, but we hadn’t systematically thought of ourselves as teachers of writing.”
Elmendorf does not believe that teaching writing is limited to the English department.
“We used to think the job of teaching writing was the job of the English department,” Elmendorf said. “It’s the recognition that writing in different disciplines is inherently different. At the same time, we’re realizing, hey, we all believe in thesis statements and paragraphs.”
To that end, Elmendorf hopes to begin incorporating more writing across entry, mid-level and upper-level biology classes this year.
“We’re committed to starting in the first-year course, setting aside time in class and lab for writing [and] peer review,” Elmendorf said. “For their first lab paper this year, students will write it together in the lab. We want our students to start writing, and as they do that they’ll start thinking more.”
Elmendorf and the department are also exploring the idea of attaching a one-credit, “communication-intensive” recitation to a set of second-year courses.
Linkon contends that the importance of writing in everyday life has increased with technology.
“People are understanding that a huge amount of our conversation is in words,” she said. “Writing is a much more accessible thing — just look how many people keep blogs.”

Georgetown students are familiar with social entrepreneurship. Now, a new campus group is committed to helping Washington, D.C. high school students foster an appreciation for the field through projects of their own.
The program, Young Changemakers, is part of LearnServe International, a D.C-based nonprofit dedicated to providing high school students with the skills needed to launch community service projects.
“The goal is to equip them with the knowledge and skills to launch their own ventures to address what really frustrates them in the world, whether it be locally or globally,” said LearnServe Young Changemakers Program Leader Jake Sorrells (SFS ’16), who participated in the one-year LearnServe Fellows Program in high school.
Each fellow learns how to develop business plans, design marketing strategies, fundraise and improve public speaking. Students are also given the opportunity to meet with local entrepreneurs, with the goal of creating their own projects.
Sorrells felt that the knowledge he had gained through the program should be shared with more students and he chose to create a similar program for his personal project.
“Too few teens were able to reap from a similar kind of opportunity,” Sorrells said. “It’s an extraordinary experience, but therein lies the problem — it should be an ordinary experience.”
After piloting the program in his high school during his junior year, Sorrells expanded Young Changemakers to Thomas Jefferson High School in Fairfax, Va. This year, the organization plans to expand into three more area high schools. While the programs were initially run by high school students who were LearnServe Fellows alumni, a team of college facilitators are now helping to lead the program.
In the spring, five students from Georgetown and two students from George Washington University were recruited to serve as leaders. All students chosen had some sort of community participation experience.
“After traveling abroad and experiencing the shortcomings of the developing world … it was difficult to ignore my feeling of helplessness,” said Elizabeth Cunningham (COL ’16), who participated in LearnServe during high school. “I also could not ignore the problems in my own area as well.”
Sorrells partnered with Compass Fellows to seek applicants.
“I applied to Young Changemakers because the mission of the program is the same as that of Compass — they want to inspire students to change the world through social entrepreneurship,” said Cherie Chung (SFS ’16), a former Compass Fellow.
LearnServe International, a decade-old organization with ties to the D.C. community, officially adopted the Young Changemakers program last year. Young Changemakers has expanded LearnServe’s reach from five students at each high school to more than 30.
“How Young Changemakers was implemented at [local high schools] helped the LearnServe fellows be more successful with their work because they had teams helping them out from the start,” LearnServe International CEO Scott Rechler said.
The team is in the process of raising $5,000 through its website to cover seed funds for participating schools and transportation costs, while also applying for grants at both universities.
High school students in the Young Changemakers program have produced 25 projects, including raising money to provide educational funds to students in Ethiopia and developing a nonprofit to provide scholarships for students with incarcerated parents.

Eight new student groups will join hundreds of other groups at the Student Activities Fair this Sunday.
Georgetown University Signs, the Georgetown Development Initiative, Georgetown Individuals Vocal and Energetic for Service, the Pre-Law Society, Riqueza Dominicana, the Chess Club, GSWAG and Tappin’ Jacks were all officially recognized by the Student Activities Commission at the end of last semester.
SAC changed the name of the event from SAC Fair to Student Activities Fair last year, before the spring semester event.
“The name change came about to reflect the scope of the fair and to more actively engage other advisory boards in the planning process,” SAC Chair Jennifer Chiang (SFS ’15) said.
The core mission of the fair remains the same, according to the SAC Commissioner who coordinated the fair.
Philip Dearing (COL ’15), co-founder of GIVES, said that his club had not originally planned to apply for Student Activities Commission recognition, but ultimately realized the advantages of SAC funding and official affiliation with the university.
GIVES, which has approximately 100 members, is dedicated to stewardship, service and random acts of kindness.
“We’re hoping that it will be such a shining light of positivity, that it’s going to shine throughout the entire campus,” Dearing said. “A major goal of ours for this semester is to increase our effect, to make it a little more profound, a little more deep, to make people think about what we’ve been given.”
The Georgetown Development Initiative also emphasizes compassion and service, but on a larger scale. According to co-founder Berk Guler (COL ’14), the group aims to produce and take action on specific, sustainable, small-scale and innovative development projects that will benefit communities in need around the world, while cooperating with local and international NGOs and receiving assistance from experienced faculty.
“Throughout the semester, we will research and choose from several small-scale projects to work on and also try to evaluate the effectiveness of our efforts,” Guler said.
Kelly Kimball (NHS ’16) — founder of Tappin’ Jacks, a tap dancing group — also noted the advantages of full SAC recognition.
“Now that we have access to benefits we are able to get our club into the rehearsal schedule, so we’ll be able to have more consistent rehearsals,” she said. “We want to have a good-sized group performing at Posada.”
While SAC benefits are awarded to these newly recognized groups, some groups, such as fraternities and H*yas for Choice, are unable to gain SAC recognition and can only table in free-speech zones.
Alan Chen (MSB ’14), co-founder of the Georgetown Chess Club, said that his organization has been operating since last fall, but required a full year to meet SAC’s membership requirements.
“Last fall we only had around 12 members,” he said. “Starting last spring we started grabbing a table on Lau 2 once a week and lay out our chess sets.”
Chen hopes that as a SAC group, the club will be able to acquire at least 10 chess sets, have more than 20 regular members and send members to professional chess competitions to represent Georgetown.
Timothy Loh (SFS ’16), co-founder of SIGNS, said he was inspired to help found a sign language and deaf culture club because of his work at a deaf ministry back home.
“Frankly, we the founders were surprised that a sign language [and] deaf culture club like ours did not exist in Georgetown and so we decided to create one,” he said. “We plan to conduct [American Sign Language] classes, raise awareness about deafness and connect with the larger deaf community in D.C.”
Adam Kaldor (COL ’14) said that he founded the Georgetown Pre-Law Society because he felt there was no organization helping students understand the law profession.
“A student group such as GPS will be able to reach out to all these potential law students, and aid them in understanding what exactly they are getting themselves into and how to best tackle each step,” he said. “However, rather than being purely informational, we would also like GPS to act as a place for active discussion of current topics in law.”
GSWAG, the Georgetown Speechwriting Advisory Group, brings together students who are interested in learning more about speechwriting and improving their written communication skills, GSWAG President Will Simmons (COL ’16) said. The group invites speechwriters and communications professionals to campus to share their experiences and stories with its members, and it is planning on running a pilot program for the Annual D.C. Speechwriting Contest this fall.
“GSWAG is about more than just speechwriting,” he said. “While that is our defining centerpiece, we have members who specialize in marketing, strategic planning, operations and finance.”
Riqueza Dominicana, launched in fall 2012, aims to provide a cultural home for Dominicans and Dominican-Americans on campus and to share Dominican culture with Georgetown.

The rewritten and slightly condensed Code of Student Conduct features streamlined guidelines in an effort to increase transparency in the disciplinary process.
The 2013-2014 code, released Thursday night, includes simplified language as well as visual elements to make it easier to navigate and comprehend. At 27 pages, the code is four pages shorter than the previous version. The biggest change is the elimination of the Category A, B and C system.
Previous changes made in the past year — like the elimination of the one-keg limit for on-campus parties and the new parking prohibition for undergraduates — are included.
The changes to the Code of Conduct were taken from recommendations by an external review conducted last fall by administrators from Duke University and Loyola University Chicago.
“As part of their recommendations, they suggested modifying the code of conduct so that it could be more easily accessed by students,” Office of Student Conduct Director Judy Johnson said.
A primary component of the external review concerned the reduction of bureaucracy. To this end, the revised code abrogates the Category C Review Committee, which formerly reviewed category C violations to determine whether the cases merited judicial hearing board review. All cases will now be handled by the judicial hearing board, which is set to expand student involvement.
“The Disciplinary Review Committee concluded that it was an unnecessary additional step. It added time to the process,” Johnson said. “Cases could be resolved more quickly if the Office of Student Conduct could do the same function, eliminating the two-day time frame.”
The Office of Student Conduct is pushing to speed up the disciplinary review process. Complainants will now have two weeks to file the initiation of judicial proceedings form, rather than the previously allotted 30 days.
Certain external review recommendations, however, have not been met with immediate implementation. For example, the revised code did not implement the suggestion of creating a mediation system for resolving disciplinary cases, although Residential Living has a pre-existing mediation process and Johnson is a trained mediator.
The external review also recommended keeping student disciplinary files after graduation for longer than the current period of one day. However, because the university already keeps files of suspended students who later return for two years and it keeps files of students who do not return after suspension or are expelled permanently, they have declined to keep the rest for longer for the time being.
Additionally, elaborating on the speech and expression policy has been tabled for future review. Free speech was a main platform of Georgetown University Student Association President Nate Tisa’s (SFS ’14) campaign platform last year, and Tisa has said he plans to work on expanding free speech zones this year.
While Johnson described the effort as “ongoing,” there is no amnesty clause for reporting sexual assault — another item on Tisa’s agenda.
The DRC is convening to explore further policy changes.
“Now that the stylistic change is complete, we actually hope to be able to utilize more student input and more student energies in looking at the code and making it something that is a reasonable and shared community standard that we all feel is appropriate,” said Tisa, who also sits on the DRC. “Idea number one has always been transparency … and then goal number two is reform.”
The Code of Student Conduct revision was a joint effort by the Office of Student Conduct and the DRC, which includes students. However, it was Olson who meted out final approval for the implementation of these recommendations.
“I think it is going well,” he said. “After the results were shared, there was a lot of discussion. … There have been a variety of changes made and I am very encouraged by it.”
In an effort to increase the accessibility of the code, GUSA’s Student Advocacy Office will release a statement highlighting certain changes and describing the reasoning behind them. The student conduct will be available through the Georgetown mobile app.
The decision to expand the Judicial Hearing Board to hear all cases, undertaken after discussion between SAO and the Office of Student Conduct, aims to amplify student engagement. Each case sits before a board of two students and three administrators.
“The pool of hearing board students is being expanded because we want students to feel connected. We want them to feel like there is student ownership of the process because now that the SAO is involved in that process, there is,” Tisa said.
SAO is attempting to expand the pool of students trained to deal with such matters. The group has received more than 40 applications — a large increase from last year. The application period closes Sept. 11.
“One of the difficulties in addressing changes really quickly is that we didn’t have enough hearing board members for turning cases around very quickly,” Johnson said.
Ultimately, Tisa said, a more accessible student code will help students advocate for themselves.
“We are hoping that students read [the code] and are more active and more knowledgeable about what it says so they can advocate for themselves and then we can be more effective as an institution once the general knowledge is a little higher,” Tisa said.

The number of transfer students admitted to Georgetown this year increased by 81, with transfer enrollment jumping by more than 40 for a total of 228 new sophomores and juniors this year.
This marks the second year of consecutive increase in the number of transfer students entering the university. In 2011, the university experienced an unexpectedly high yield on first-year students, causing the university to purposefully limit transfer student enrollment to 141. Since then, application and enrollment numbers have steadily risen.
The rise to 81 admitted transfer students was not heavily influenced by applications, as only 11 more transfer students applied this year than in 2012.
Senior Associate Director of Admissions Bruce Chamberlin said that this year falls on the higher end of the range of transfer student enrollment, which usually runs from 140 to 230 students.
Chamberlin attributed the jump in transfer admission rate to a slight increase in juniors studying abroad, as well as attrition in the Class of 2017 over the summer, also citing a welcoming attitude toward transfer students.
“We welcome transfer students as a critical mass, and bringing 220-plus students really gives some nice unity and some sense of cohesion and community to the transfer students when they arrive,” Chamberlin said. “We’re not talking about a handful of students. We’re talking about a sizeable portion of the student body … at least the transfer students I’ve talked to, they get an immediate sense of community.”
Keith Bennett (COL ’16), a transfer from Connecticut College this year, agreed and said he appreciated the feeling of coming in with a large community of fellow transfers.
“I didn’t expect the class to be as large as it is, but I’m glad it is — we’re already starting to bond as a transfer class,” Bennett said. “The transfer-only events [of NSO] were particularly good because, well, personally, I turn 22 in October, and meeting new freshmen was strange, being four years older than them.”
Chamberlin added that transfer students approach the admissions process more deliberately because of the difficulty of leaving another school — a sentiment Bennett agreed with.
“It was difficult to say goodbye to my friends,” Bennett said. “But once I got into Georgetown, it was a pretty easy decision in terms of fit — I was looking for a place that had opportunities beyond what was available to me at my old school.”
Matthew Ahern (COL ’16), a transfer from Austin College, acknowledged the differences between arriving at Georgetown as a transfer and a freshman.
“After one year of college, you know more specifically what you want or what you don’t want — you can think about things you definitely need to have in your new institution,” Ahern said. “That can definitely inform where you’re looking. And you’ve already gone through the process once, and while it’s not identical, it’s rather similar. That makes it more straightforward.”

The Dog Tag Bakery, an upcoming addition to the Georgetown dessert scene, will do more than serve cookies — it strives to integrate young veterans back into the workforce through a partnership with the School of Continuing Studies.
The bakery, located at 3206 Grace St. and set to open in Feburary 2014, will serve baguettes, rolls, Danishes, cookies, fudge, dog biscuits and coffee in a space staffed by veterans who simultaneously take SCS courses.
The bakery will employ veterans between the ages of 19 and 25 for four to six months as they take classes in order to earn a certificate in entrepreneurship, business and theater. Dog Tag Bakery founder Fr. Richard Curry, S.J., a Catholic Studies professor at Georgetown, said that he founded the bakery in order to help put wounded soldiers and their spouses back to work and to provide training for successful civilian life.
Curry worked with the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and other veterans’ affairs facilities and also obtained a grant from the Coalition to Salute America’s Heroes, which will fund 12 weeks of SCS education and training for the first veteran hired at the bakery.
Curry stressed the importance of the entrepreneurial skills learned through the bakery.
“We are very excited to get the disabled veterans through our program so that they can go out and start their small businesses,” Curry said.
Georgetown University Student Veteran Association President Zachary Zimmerman (MSB ’14) added that the experience of learning and applying skills would give disabled veterans a needed boost.
“They don’t just learn a new skill as far as baking,” Zimmerman said. “That’s a hard skill, sure, but the soft skills are really going to be important — how do you run a business, what is something that an entrepreneur needs to focus on. It really gives them their own set of tools so they can get back on their feet in a self-sustaining way.”
Near the end of the employment period, the veterans will also utilize their newly learned theater skills to perform their personal stories onstage in the bakery. Curry said this was an important step in the veterans’ mental health.
“Our real goal is to re-integrate the disabled veterans so they get used to their transformation of their bodies, get them very comfortable with the public, re-integrate them into society and get them astute in business, so they can go out and get the employment that they deserve,” Curry said. “I consider the stage as important as an oven.”
Zimmerman emphasized the importance of acknowledging the mental trauma in addition to the physical difficulties that disabled veterans often face.
“You go from being able to do superhuman things to not even being able to tie your own shoes,” Zimmerman said.
Curry added that the bakery would hire Georgetown students as waiters and waitresses. The presence of local students would create a college atmosphere for the veterans and would remind students of the harsh realities of veteran sacrifice.
“I think it’s important for students to realize that fellow students their age are defending our country,” Curry said.

Revised sketches of the Northeast Triangle Residence Hall were received favorably at the second student dorm forum in Leavey Center on Wednesday evening.
After the original design proposal was panned this summer by students and alumni, architectural firm SasakiAssociates and Georgetown administrators held a forum to gather input in July. Sasaki incorporated recommendations from the first forum into its revised designs.
The material for the dorm’s exterior has been changed from gray slate to stone in an attempt to build a dorm more consistent with main campus architecture. The building will also have limestone, wood accents and carder rock, which are used in both Copley Hall and White-Gravenor Hall, along with some glass features.
Sasaki architects cited the Rafik B.Hariri Building’s blend of traditional stone and modern glass design as a main influence.
Other key changes to the dorm included reducing the number of beds from 250 to 225. The height of the building was reduced where it is closest to the walkway from Red Square to Leavey Center to address concerns that the original design was too obtrusive.
As part of a sustainability push, the new dorm designs also include a bicycle storage area that will fit 100 bikes at the back of the dorm. Dorm rooms will be Copley-style suites with one bathroom per suite. There will also be apartments for chaplains-in-residence, as is standard in Georgetown dorms.
To address concerns that the location of the dorm is taking up one of the last remaining green spaces on campus, Sasaki will add green space on the rooftop, though the exact details and the accessibility of the roof have yet to be determined. The design also leaves in place many of the large oak trees that dot the landscape between Intercultural Center and Henle Village. The dorm will create a terraced hill that Sasaki hopes will be more utilized than the current green space.
“What we’ve heard from you is that green space is very valuable,” Sasaki architect Katia Lucic said. “In our design, we are leaving 50 percent of the space open and green.”
Reactions to the new dorm designs were generally positive. Georgetown University Student Association Director of Student Space Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14), who serves on the Northeast Triangle design committee, noted the evident response to criticism received at the previous event.
“There’s still lots to be improved upon,” Appelbaum said. “But almost all of the changes were positive and direct responses to student and alumni feedback.”
The forum comes one week before a meeting of the Old Georgetown Board, which will review these revisions. The board had postponed deliberations on the dorm July 3 until Georgetown and Sasakiwould be prepared to present information about the seven other dorm sites that had been considered.
Adding 225 beds to the north side of campus will be a step toward creating roughly equal population distribution of students between this area and the east and south sides of campus.
“Over the next five or six years, we probably have to add roughly 694 beds to meet the letter of the demand from the city of Georgetown,” Sasaki Principal Architect Ricardo Dumont said. “This first project will give us roughly 225 beds. What we’re looking to do is balance the distribution of beds from this unbalanced distribution.”
The Sasaki architects were pleased with the tone of the feedback at the Wednesday forum, saying it reflected well on the changes made to the design.
“We were encouraged that there was less acrimony today,” Dumont said. “We tried to be very open and honest at the last forum. We did that — it resulted in a lot of good feedback that they gave us and we incorporated into the design. We thought it was positive, and there’s still months left to design.”
Though student feedback was more positive than at the previous forum, some criticism remained. One student had a question about how handicapped accessible the building would be.
“It was a little disconcerting to be talking about the [Americans with Disabilities Act], and for Sasaki to just say ‘Oh, we’ll comply,’” Alyssa Peterson (COL ’14) said. “It really felt like they hadn’t made an effort to reach out to people with disabilities. It feels like they could be doing more.”
The next student forum will be held in September.

An administrative shift this summer eliminated the Office of Off-Campus Life in favor of a new Office of Neighborhood Life, separating off-campus resources from disciplinary action.
The new office will assist students with off-campus life, while disciplinary sanctions off campus will be handled by the Office of Student Conduct.
The separation will refocus the mission of the Office of Neighborhood Life on helping students, Interim Director Cory Peterson, who has worked for Residential Life for the past seven years, said.
“Our mission is really to be a resource for students,” Peterson said. “[The separation allows] our office to be set up as a resource for students about anything, whether from ‘[the Metropolitan Police Department] knocked on my door last night’ or ‘I have an issue with my landlord.’”
The Office of Neighborhood Life will partner with the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, the D.C. Office of the Tenant Advocate and the Georgetown Student Tenant Association, an offshoot of the Georgetown University Student Association launched this summer.
“We really believe students should be living in safe houses,” Peterson said. “Too long have students been paying thousands and thousands of dollars a month to put up with a hole in the ceiling or the wall … or a landlord who’s absentee or just unhelpful. … Our students are people too.”
Peterson — who spoke to freshmen and sophomores about off-campus life at floor meetings this week — said he aims to uphold transparency in communicating the reality of off-campus life to students, despite university efforts to move students back on campus as required in the 2010 Campus Plan agreement.
“There’s no smoke and mirrors …We want to make sure you have all the information to make the right decisions,” Peterson said. “The students are at the table as well.”
Peterson said his experience in Residence Life helps him communicate clearly with off-campus students.
“I feel like I’m a better advocate for students, talking about how we want to free up social space on campus, such as getting rid of the keg limit [and] party registration,” Peterson said. “I lived in that era a few years ago where it was difficult to socialize on campus. It’s important to have that kind of voice at the table who understands both sides … to see what it used to be like and what it could be.”
Some students found the new distinction between off-campus resources and disciplinary action helpful.
“I think Cory has been super helpful and responsive as to what students are looking for and I’m happy that the judiciary side has been moved,” Adaire Carey (COL ’14), who lived off campus last year and this year, said. “Now that I know the punishment side is being handled by another office, I’m more likely to see Cory as an ally.”
Andrew Greenough (SFS ’14), who lived off campus last year, said he was more likely to rely on the new office.
“By and large, I would be more likely to use it just because it’s easy to put more trust into their intentions,” Greenough said.
Other students, however, said the separation was not enough to distinguish the two functions.
“I know that they’re not able to write you up, but a lot of them have old members of the staff team … I personally have an issue distinguishing that they have separate jobs,” Katie Lawlor (COL ’14), who was written up by a current Office of Neighborhood Life staff member when she lived on campus, said.
In his new position, Peterson hopes to improve the sentiment surrounding the Office of Neighborhood Life and to increase the engagement between students and neighbors, potentially by sponsoring community dinners.
“[We want] students and nonstudents to engage not in community-relation conversations, but just conversations,” Peterson said. “It might be about Syria, it might be about the legalization of marijuana … whatever they want to talk about. It’s about building relations and building the community further.”

Students of legal age will now be permitted to consume wine and beer outside in specific areas of Village A and Henle Village as part of a pilot program beginning today.
The Outdoor Student Living Pilot Program, which originated from Georgetown Community Partnership discussions in June, was implemented after summer negotiations among the Georgetown University Student Association, Residential Living and the Department of Public Safety. The policy goes into effect immediately.
According to Director of Residential Education Ed Gilhooland DPS Chief of Police Jay Gruber, students will be able to drink from open containers in groups of fewer than 15 people in the barbecue areas of Village A and Henle. Student can drink outdoors at any time of the day as long as they abide by noise restrictions during quiet hours. There is no campus-wide open container policy, and the pilot program is limited to these two areas.
The success of the pilot program will be assessed by the end of the fall semester and again at the end of the year, at which point decisions will be made about extending the program to areas including the Alumni Square courtyard, the Southwest Quad lawn and the LXR courtyard. Assessment will be based on the number of incidents of noise complaints, underage alcohol consumptions and the frequency ofDPS intervention
“In this pilot, no news is good news,” Gruber said.
Gruber, who has supported the implementation of the pilot program, said that DPS would intervene only if students were not abiding by the designated rules. DPS officers will not ask for proof of age unless there is a disturbance.
“The intent is that if they are going by the spirit and letter of the policy, we’re not going to approach them, we’re going to sort of ignore them,” Gruber said. “But once they bring attention to themselves, we have to intervene and interact, then people who are underage could get sanctioned for possession of alcohol under the age of 21.”
Although beer and wine will be permitted outdoors, Gruber said that kegs are not within the limits of the pilot program.
“If we’re looking at 10 to 12 people, a keg is overkill,” he said. “It invites that party feel and party atmosphere, which is different from bringing a couple of six-packs or a case shared by a small group of people.”
The same reasoning was behind the decision not to permit liquor as part of the pilot program.
In April, the university lifted the one-keg limit for on-campus parties to promote on-campus socializing. Last August, the party registration system, which required students holding on-campus parties to inform the university in advance, was abolished. Students were already permitted to drink outside on Village A rooftops.
“We’ve had a series of policy changes regarding alcohol in the past few years,” Gilhool said. “Each time, we’ve seen the students take those changes seriously and be very mindful of the opportunities to have more socializing on campus and prove in time again that these types of initiatives and us looking at policies a little differently can be really successful on campus and enhance the student experience.”
GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) said he was confident that the pilot would be successful.
“If you give students more control over their lives, it’s a privilege but also a responsibility. We think students are up to the challenge,” Tisa said.
GUSA Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) emphasized that the goal of the pilot program is to make on-campus housing as appealing an option as off-campus housing.
“On campus, the sense of ownership stops as soon as you leave your door, whereas in an off-campus apartment, your backyard and driveway is your living space,” Ramadan said. “What students can do in their off-campus private space, we want to extend it on campus.”
Gruber said the program has the potential to benefit everyone involved, including the neighborhood community, students and DPS. “We’ll hopefully have less large parties that we’ll have to respond to. Upperclassmen who are of age will have an opportunity to use alcohol in a responsible way and won’t have to be in a situation where the drinking light is on or the drinking light is off.”
Although they cited the central goal as making socializing more appealing on campus, both Gruber and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said there was not a direct connection between the pilot program and the 2010 Campus Plan agreement, which mandated drawing social life to campus and away from residential neighborhoods.
“It’s not just about the campus plan. The fact that it juxtaposes with the campus plan, I think is a win-win,” Olson said. “I believe this is an element of that agreement that very much listens to and responds to student interests and student concerns.”
Tisa said that the campus plan was still a vital component when discussing the policy changes of the past year. This year, the Office of Residence Life will meet with InterHall to discuss the possibility of decreasing quiet hours.
“If you look in the campus agreement itself, one of the clauses we’ve really latched onto is you have to equalize policy on campus and off campus,” he said. “It should [be] equally, if not more, attractive to socialize on campus.”
This particular policy change comes in time for the long weekend.
“Happy Labor Day, I guess,” Tisa said.

The familiar complaint of dropped cell phone calls in Burleith and Darnall Hall will be eased next summer when a Verizon cell phone tower will be installed on the roof of Leavey Center.
The university is currently in the process of obtaining a construction permit from the D.C. municipal government to begin construction of the tower, which is expected to be completed by July 2014. The tower will consist of a set of antennae that are four feet high.
“Verizon Wireless is working with Georgetown University to expand our 4G LTE network coverage on campus to provide students, faculty, medical center staff and patients, as well as the greater Georgetown community, with the best possible wireless coverage,” Verizon spokesperson Melanie Ortel wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Verizon Wireless will pay the cost of installing the antennas and will also pay Georgetown for the use of university property.
“Having these antennas at Georgetown is a total win for the Georgetown community,” Chief Information Officer Lisa Davis said.
The construction of the tower is intended to alleviate the poor signal many Verizon customers receive on campus. According to Davis, the Verizon signal is the weakest of all mobile carriers at Georgetown.
“In some places it’s fine, [but] in general, the service is pretty bad,” Kelli Foy (SFS ’16) said.
Talks between Verizon and the university have been going on for several years. Davis said she prioritized this project when she became chief information officer in January 2012.
“So many of us have Verizon as a vendor,” Davis said. “Any opportunity to increase coverage with any of the vendors is a welcome opportunity.”
There are no plans, however, to install cell towers for other mobile service providers.
“There really hasn’t been a need or requirement from the AT&T or Sprint perspective,” Davis said.
The university will receive $22,000 in revenue and spend no money to complete this project. The surrounding neighbors will also receive a noticeable increase in mobile coverage.
The Verizon tower is part of University Information Services’ five-year modernization plan to increase the university’s capacity for mobile devices, which has focused on Wi-Fi, virtual computing and network connection upgrades since its early 2013 launch.
The network connection upgrade will increase the university’s data transmission capacity by 1,000 percent, and the private cloud upgrade will save the university $700,000.
