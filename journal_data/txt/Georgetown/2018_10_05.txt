Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia condemned the use of “violent imagery” Tuesday after professor Christine Fair was criticized for a Saturday tweet that called for violence against Republican senators.
The tweet has come under fire from alumni, students and conservative-leaning media. DeGioia said the university would follow established procedures if comments made by faculty are found to affect student learning.
On Saturday, Fair posted the tweet in response to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s Sept. 27 Senate testimony denying allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford and to Republican senators’ continued support for Kavanaugh.
“Look at [this] chorus of entitled white men justifying a serial rapist’s arrogated entitlement. All of them deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps,” Fair wrote. “Bonus: we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine? Yes.”
Fair clarified in a subsequent tweet Tuesday that she does not actually wish to see violence against Republican senators and that she intended to instill discomfort in readers.
“I do NOT and NEVER have condoned violence. My tweet, as I have explained, was an attempt to make YOU as UNCOMFORTABLE as I am using the language of the abuse I receive by the hundreds,” Fair wrote.
A poster was hung early Thursday morning in Red Square displaying Fair’s initial tweet and questioning the university’s response, reading “Why won’t President DeGioia condemn this?”
DeGioia responded to Fair’s tweets supporting university officials’ right to freedom of speech in a statement released Tuesday. Fair remains employed by the university, Fair wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“We protect the right of our community members to exercise their freedom of expression. This does not mean the University endorses the content of their expression,” DeGioia wrote. “We can and do strongly condemn the use of violent imagery, profanity, and insensitive labeling of individuals based on gender, ethnicity or political affiliation in any form of discourse. Such expressions go against our values.”
Fair says she does not expect any significant changes in her professional life following the attention her tweet has received.
“My dean knows how to reach me,” Fair told The Washington Post on Tuesday. “This morning I’ve been prepping for classes. I’ve not checked my email because most of it is rubbish.”
The media coverage has not affected her classes or student interactions, Fair said. However, she said she has received a large volume of hate mail and two active death threats which she has reported to the Metropolitan Police Department.
“I’m still doing what needs to be done!” Fair wrote.
Fair’s tweet quickly gained attention, and Campus Reform, a conservative news outlet that aims to combat a liberal bias it alleges exists on U.S. university campuses, requested a comment from Fair on her tweet.
Fair published Campus Reform’s request for comment with a 2,400-word post on her personal blog Sept. 30.
Fair criticized the effects of conservative media reporting in her post, underlining the threats she has received.
“For one thing, you intend to outrage CON-servatives (especially those pissed off men who hate women) and thus motivate them to harass me and send me threatening missives,” Fair wrote in her blog post. “If you don’t intend to do this, then you’re ludicrously obtuse because this is the inevitable consequence of your ‘reportage.’ Would you like to see some of the violent missives I get as a result this ‘news’ cycle?”
Fair’s tweet received further coverage and backlash after Fox News host Tucker Carlson accused Fair of advocating for genocide during his Monday night monologue.
Carlson’s comments themselves received significant backlash, including landing him on Southern Poverty Law Center’s “Hatewatch” list, but Fair still found her Twitter account deactivated Tuesday morning, according to The Washington Post. The account was reactivated Tuesday evening.
Despite critiques to her abrasive language, Fair said she believes her methods are more likely to bring about the results she wishes to see.
“The idea you can effect change by using the normative language expected of someone with a Ph.D. is false,” Fair told The Washington Post. “I aim to create language that creates as much discomfort as I am forced to feel in this regime.”
Fair said she strongly objects to attempts to restrict women’s ability to express their anger over sexual assault and rape culture.
“It’s another way to discipline women’s bodies, by asking us to discipline our rage,” Fair told The Washington Post. “I cannot tell you the rage and hurt it feels as all of those men on that Judiciary Committee kicked sexual assault survivors in the gut.”
Fair’s Saturday tweet is not the first time the professor has received significant attention for her commentary. Last year, Fair was accused of calling German police officers Nazis during an altercation at a Frankfurt airport. In November 2015, she came under fire for publicly supporting the use of drones in civilian-inhabited regions.
Coverage of Fair’s tweets follows the suspension of National Catholic School of Social Service Dean at Catholic University of America Will Rainford for his tweets questioning the validity of Kavanaugh accuser Julie Swetnick’s account.

Jack DeGoia should be ashamed. Professor Fair should be fired . As a 1968 graduate of the College I am saddened and angered by her conduct. I will not be making a further financial contribution to the University.

Dr. Fair: As a Georgetown alum and Adjunct Asst. Professor, I agree with you that Judge Kavanaugh should not be confirmed. There are plenty of conservative judges without his baggage that will make the Supreme Court look more partisan. But your language about Senators who support him “dying a miserable death” doesn’t help.
“I Disapprove of What You Say, But I Will Defend to the Death Your Right to Say It.”  Free speech is a priceless right, but it also carries an obligation to use it wisely and for the benefit of mankind. Like a hammer, it can be used to build or destroy. As a lawyer, I’ve never found yelling the best way to settle disputes, discover truth, or provide healing. As to Eric Trump’s attack on you, if he is concerned about intemperate speech, perhaps he could talk to his father, the President, about not using thousands of lies, as reported by the Washington Post, to score political points.  It damages the trust we must have in our political institutions. So, let’s all work a little harder to turn verbal swords into plowshares. More light, less heat! Dave Muchow, BSFS ’66, L ’71.

Fair should be fired for tweeting a call to violence against white men. Is this the role of an academic? Does this show academic “temperament” fit to teach our children? It’s also interesting that the authors say the tweet was condemned “…by..conservative-leaning media…” Why is not the entire media condemning such a violent position? As an Independent voter, i look for verifiable facts before making decisions, not emotional “feelings” toward someone. Please condemn this horrific tweet by removing Fair from her position of power and authority and restoring Georgetown’s good name!

President Jack DeGioia is a total clown and lightweight compared to his peers. As an alum, I love the university but am so disappointed by it in so many ways. If anyone thinks Professor Fair should be a Georgetown professor, I implore you to read here nonsensical Twitter posts. It’s full of lunacy and uneducated points of view that only make Georgetown look bad.
Years ago, I decided to stop donating to Georgetown as long as DeGioia remained president. This all validated that decision.

I, too, was shocked and dismayed by Professor Fair’s comments as reported in the national media. They seem to go against the spirit of what I took away from the school. I was at Georgetown in the 1980s. It was during the Reagan years and conservatives ruled DC. One of the great things at GU was that I had both conservative and liberal professors. Debate and the understanding of points of view that sometimes differed dramatically were encouraged.  Much like the required course, Problem of God, which studied different religions, my government courses explored the two party system thoroughly. Even as a conservative, I remember Professor Elaine Kamarck, a DNC member, being one of my more outstanding professors.  Similarly, I remember a liberal professor talking about how out outrageous it was that Steve Jobs was worth $200 million at age 25,  only to be debated by a 19-year-old student in the business school about why the innovation his company brought to the world was easily worth that much, if not much more.  30 years later, it appears the student was right!
One great gift of Georgetown was it opened me up to learning and understanding disparate views. However, violence was never encouraged condoned,  particularly in such a crude manner. I am stunned and embarrassed for my alma mater.

“A serial rapist’s arrogated entitlement?”
Does Professor Fair understand that not one of the accusers even made a claim of rape,  much less claim that the accused is a serial rapist?  Professor’s should deal in truth.

Georgetown is probably hoping to quietly reinstate her into her position in a few weeks or so after she returns from paid leave. As if someone with such a long history of vile outbursts against those with whom she disagrees can be reformed in that period of time. Are we to believe someone with such lack of self-control will suddenly transform into a calm, fair, and respectful person once she arrives on campus?

“The idea you can effect change by using the normative language expected of someone with a Ph.D. is false,”
Maybe the primary job of a professor is to teach students about the world and not to “effect change” by insulting a bunch of people on the internet. If she really thinks things are so bad for women, then she should pull a Warren and run for office or take a fulltime job at a pro-women NGO.
This isn’t the first time Fair has stirred controversy on Twitter. I don’t think that a professor should get fired just for saying or Tweeting controversial things, even if he or she has demonstrated a persistent pattern of intentionally insulting others. However, at this point Georgetown should mandate that all of Fair’s public statements focus on her areas of expertise (i.e. South Asia and counterterrorism). I suspect that Fair could still find lots of places within those topics to advocate for women.

U.S. democracy is faltering, and citizens must hold their government accountable to rebuild the United States, urged former Secretary of State John Kerry at an event Thursday evening in Gaston Hall.
Kerry blamed the failings of U.S. democratic institutions, in areas ranging from gender equality to election finance, in part on highly partisan politics.
“Our democracy right now is not working; we’re not making decisions,” Kerry said. “What’s happened today is, sadly, we have people who are more beholden to protect their power, party and president than they are to hold their oath of office, the constitution, and to protect the institution in which they serve. And that’s just plain wrong.”
Kerry was joined by retired Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the U.S. Department of State Admiral John Kirby. Kirby is an adjunct lecturer in the journalism program at Georgetown.
The pair spoke about Kerry’s new book, “Every Day is Extra,” an autobiography published Sept. 4, in the conversation hosted by the Georgetown University’s Master of Science in Foreign Service program.
Drawing on historical examples, including the civil rights movement, Kerry said citizens have to engage with the democratic processes of the United States to hold political systems and leaders accountable. Historically, young people have spearheaded some advocacy efforts, he said.
“If you’re going to be a country that is a democracy that lives by rule of law, citizens have to hold the system accountable so that it is genuinely by rule of law,” Kerry said. “It was young people in the 1960s and the civil rights movement, young people in the women’s movement, young people in the environment movement, young people in the peace movement. All this happened because kids actually took time off from school.”
College-age students now more than ever, Kerry insisted, need to use elections to combat corrupting influences in government.
“You all have an amazing power. I hope you will recognize your own power right now. I know you have to study like hell,” Kerry said. “But lots of folks before you have managed to make it through to exams, write their dissertation and still change the nation at the same time, and we need you more than ever. We cannot be a nation where only 54.2 percent of the eligible voters in our nation see fit to come out to vote for the presidency of our nation.”
For the 2016 election, 90.4 percent of Georgetown students were registered to vote prior to the election, with 71.1 percent of registered students turning out to vote, resulting in a student turnout rate of 64.2 percent at Georgetown, according to a 2016 report by the National Study of Learning, Voting and Engagement.
Past elections serve as evidence of the opportunity for social change that can result from voting, according to Kerry. He also emphasized the role that voters can have in the upcoming midterm elections Nov. 6 to hold political leaders accountable.
“In 34 days, we have a course correction election in America, and we have to make sure the candidates are being held accountable on what they’re willing to do and what they’re going to do for the environment, climate change, for energy and for a host of other issues,” Kerry said. “I tell you folks, because I had five elections, I got elected to the Senate five times. There is nothing like your friends losing on a specific issue to stiffen the spine of the people who survived.”
Global climate change is one of the single greatest threats facing the nation and world, Kerry said, criticizing President Donald Trump’s June 1, 2017 decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, an international agreement to reduce climate change by mitigating greenhouse gas emissions passed in December 2015. Signatories of the agreement pledged to limit the global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius.
“We’re not respecting God’s work, creation,” Kerry said. “This is about life and death, and people sometimes accuse me of getting a little bit hot about this, and I do. I’m angry about it because the decision the president made to get out of Paris for ideological reasons was not based on one single scientific fact.”
Still, Kerry said, beyond the Paris Climate Agreement, more drastic measures need to be taken to properly curb global climate change.
“We are not guaranteeing the world we will hold the world’s temperature to a rise of 2 degrees centigrade,” Kerry said. “We’re just not achieving that in this because no country is reducing enough to meet that target.”
Kerry cited damages inflicted by recent natural disasters — including Hurricane Maria, which struck Puerto Rico in September 2017; Hurricane Irma, which hit Caribbean islands in August 2017; and Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall near Houston in August 2017 — as further evidence for a need to shift away from fossil fuels. The three storms required $265 billion for clean-up costs.
“Last year we spent $265 billion on three storms, to clean up three storms: Maria, Irma and Harvey,” Kerry said.
Kerry expressed hope that strengthening the U.S. democratic process is possible, but significant work is needed to return the United States to past prominence, he said.
“We’re the country that invented the internet, the country that went to the moon. We need to rebuild America, and we need to deal with these relentless traffic jams where you can’t move anywhere in our country,” Kerry said.

Beyoncé’s  2017 Grammy Awards performance  of “Take My Hand, Precious Lord,” may not be the typical start to a class at Georgetown University. But for professor Michael Eric Dyson, pop-cultural emblems and music videos regularly feature in his “Sociology and Culture: Beyoncé” class; a course where students often discuss topics such as the political implication of Beyoncé’s inclusion of young black men as backup singers.
Since his arrival at Georgetown  in 2007, Dyson has lectured almost a thousand Hoyas about the fusion  of politics, hip-hop  and race relations. His fame and popularity among students with classes like “Sociology of Hip-Hop,” as well as impassioned sermons  to church congregations, have attracted NBC and Washington Post reporters to his lectures.
Dyson believes art, no matter how subtle, can act as a platform for resistance. His work as a sociology professor blurs into artistic expression: He is a prolific author of more than 20 books, a political analyst for several news outlets such as CNN and MSNBC,  and an ordained Baptist minister since age 19. Indeed, Dyson’s many art forms — teaching, writing, preaching, protesting — all contribute to his political activism.
The Scholarship of Hip-hop
Dyson began exploring the United States’ tumultuous racial divide through hip-hop lyrics during his time at Princeton University, where he earned his doctorate in religion in 1993. At the time, many scholars scoffed at the notion that hip-hop could be perceived as an academic discipline. However, Dyson saw hip-hop — or, as he prefers to call it, the “CNN of the inner-city” — in a different light.
Dyson explained that the genre has historically served as an avenue for young black Americans to express pertinent social issues ignored by mainstream media.
“The racial traumas and crisis of society were being addressed in music,” he said in an interview with The Hoya.
Dyson first brought his scholarly hip-hop analysis to classrooms in 1995 at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill.  Since joining the sociology department at Georgetown in 2007, Dyson has created courses about Jay-Z, Kendrick Lamar and Beyoncé. Enrollment in his courses are healthy by any professor’s standards, with his Jay-Z class attracting 150 students.
Teaching a course about Beyoncé means keeping up with the ever-changing nature of pop culture. Drawing parallels to his personal friend Jay-Z — who Skyped into Dyson’s class a few years ago —  Dyson said he always strives to “learn and grow and be inspired by young people.”
That means listening to the same music young people gravitate towards. When asked what album all Georgetown students should listen to, Dyson said “Illmatic” by Nas because the album is the best hip-hop album of all time. “[‘Illmatic’] is arguably one of the greatest, some would argue the greatest hip-hop album ever produced, ” Dyson said.  Honorable mentions included Lauryn Hill’s “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill”, Jay-Z’s “The Blueprint” and 2Pac’s “All Eyez on Me.”
A Political Preacher
Though Dyson tries to remain politically impartial in his classroom, he regularly expresses his political views elsewhere. In his impassioned eulogy  of Aretha Franklin at her funeral last month, the professor characterized President Donald Trump with a string of alliterative insults, calling him a “dimwitted dictator,” “foolish fascist” and “lugubrious leech.” Merriam-Webster soon after tweeted out that searches on their site  for the word “lugubrious” jumped 3,200 percent during his speech.
The speech elicited a mixed response: some applauded his memorable message, while others accused Dyson of politicizing the funeral. The Georgetown professor came to his own defense, arguing his comments were in the spirit of Franklin’s activism.
“That was the perfect moment, I think — a highly visible, highly audible moment — where I could speak the politics of resistance at a funeral for a woman who not only was a great singer, but socially active, deeply and profoundly resistant to the ideals that Donald Trump represented,” Dyson said in an interview with The Hoya.
Dyson’s sharp and public criticisms of Trump are just one in his long tradition of decrying injustice. An early critic of Bill Cosby, Dyson authored a book back in 2006 titled, “Is Bill Cosby Right?: Or Has the Black Middle Class Lost Its Mind?”
Bill Cosby was charged to three counts of aggravated indecent assault in April 2018, after over 60 women accused him of sexual assault offenses. He will face between three and 10 years in prison. In the book, Dyson accuses the comedian of unjustly shifting blame onto poor black people  for their socio-economic hardships with little regard for systemic injustices.
“I thought it was obscene and profane for a man of extraordinary talent and genius, no doubt, but also wealth, to use his bully pulpit to beat up on poor black people,” Dyson said.
But while demanding accountability for Cosby’s actions, Dyson also noted a racially charged double standard in the #MeToo movement.
“It is rather interesting, striking, that the first major person to go down is a black person in an era when a lot of white guys have misbehaved,” Dyson said.
He alluded to similar hypocrisy in his Beyoncé lecture to Georgetown students this week, comparing the criminalization of black teenagers with another metaphorical  “17-year-old on trial” right now. Studies show the black youth are perceived as older, which has led to a persistent judicial bias in prosecuting them as adults, according to Dyson.
“Is Mr. [Brett] Kavanaugh held to the same degree of expectation and responsibility as Trayvon Martin?” Dyson said. “What is the difference? Why is it we criminalize one group of people and exonerate the other?”
Georgetown’s evolving racial discourse
The acknowledgement of Georgetown’s troubled legacy with slavery has advanced the developing conversation about race on campus, Dyson said.
“We’ve made significant and visible progress in terms of not only acknowledging it, not only studying it, but then trying to make policy and practice as a result of that awareness,” Dyson said.
The Society of Jesus  sold 272 enslaved people from plantations in Maryland in 1838 to keep Georgetown University financially afloat. Beginning in 2015, the university has taken steps to make amends to the descendant community: formally apologizing for Georgetown’s role in the slave trade, granting legacy status to descendants of the 272, and renaming buildings to honor Isaac Hawkins and Anne Marie Becraft.
More recent efforts to advance the conversation around race on campus  include the creation of the department of African American studies in June 2016 and the launch of the Institute for Racial Justice this fall.
Still, descendants have criticized the university for failing to address descendants’ more immediate needs, including access to quality education before college. Noting that challenges remain, Dyson is hopeful in Georgetown’s continued response.
“President [John J.] DeGioia has shown tremendous foresight, courage and vision in straightforwardly addressing this issue,” Dyson said.
Dyson recommended Georgetown provide scholarships for descendants of the 272. “If we derived resources based upon the unjust and anti-human enslavement of black people, we’ve got to extend the same resources,” Dyson said.
Multiple roles, One Cause
In his most recent book “Tears We Cannot Stop,” in which Dyson powerfully calls on the United States to confront and remedy its racial anxiety, Dyson structured the work as “a sermon to white America.” The choice was an homage to yet another role Dyson occupies: an ordained minister, a position through which he regularly celebrates American black power and laments racial injustices in his Sunday church services.
Still, Dyson does not view his many professions, hobbies and roles as distinct from each other. Rather, they blend together through their overlap in artistic expression.
“I’ve never seen a separation between the head I wear as a professor, as a political analyst, as a social activist, as a preacher … as an essayist, as a person who loves poetry. I see those all as fused together,” Dyson said. “Even my politics are inspired by my poetry, are inspired by my preaching, are inspired by my quest for literacy.”
The interconnected nature of his many passions drives him to inspire, speak out and motivate societal change.
“We can rise up again to embrace the politics of cooperation and love and justice,” Dyson said.  “The reason I continue to teach, especially undergraduates, is to be re-inspired with the expectation that human action can lead to social betterment and therefore the redemption of our society.”

Americans are becoming increasingly isolated from people with opposing political ideologies, Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said in an event Monday evening in Lohrfink Auditorium.
Titled “State of the Disunion: A Conversation with Senator Marco Rubio,” the event was hosted by the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service and co-sponsored by the Georgetown University College Republicans. The conversation was moderated by GU Politics Executive Director Mo Elleithee.
The increasing polarization of the two-party system results in part from growing geographical pockets of political homogeneity, Rubio said.
“If the only thing you know about another person is a political issue that you feel passionately about, it’s easy to dislike that person and to be angry at them, and that has become more true recently to the point where we actually have enclaves developing in America,” Rubio said. “People are actually moving to places where there are more voters like them, and less on the other side.”
Despite the development of political enclaves across the nation, Rubio’s home precinct in West Miami voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election while surrounding precincts voted for Hillary Clinton, exposing him to a diverse group of perspectives, according to Rubio.
Politicians with differing political ideologies must learn to work together and compromise on national policy to effect change, he said.
“You’re not going anywhere, I’m not going anywhere. For the rest our lives, we’re going to share this country,” Rubio said. “We’re going to have to, by force, figure out a way to work on something that we can agree on, or it’s going to be bad for all of us.”
Polarization hinders bipartisan efforts, leading political leadership to bear the responsibility of promoting bipartisanship, according to Rubio.
“Your own side will pillory you for selling out, you know, and the other side will say, ‘We don’t want you, because we disagree with you on nine other things,’” Rubio said. “That’s the problem right now, but eventually, that’s got to be broken through, and I think it does start with leadership and setting an example.”
Forty percent of the 245 bills Rubio co-sponsored in 2017 were introduced by non-Republicans.
Rubio introduced a bipartisan bill, the Defending Elections from Threats by Establishing Redlines Act, with Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) this July. The DETER Act uses the threat of sanctions to dissuade involvement from foreign powers in political elections following Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election. The bill was also co-sponsored by senators from across the political spectrum, including Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Mark Warner (D-Va.).
One way to combat political echo chambers is to understand the viewpoints of people with differing backgrounds and political ideologies, according to Rubio.
“Americans have to know other people,” Rubio said. “We have to be more exposed to people that are not like us in America because I think you start to see them as people and not as statistics or a name or a check box on a census document and we used to have that more than we do today.”
Politics has creeped into every aspect of life, removing spheres where people can understand each other on a level outside of their political beliefs, Rubio said.
“The institutions that used to regulate how we treat one another, outside of government, outside of politics, have broken down or frazzled in a way that they no longer regulate how people treat each other in the political realm,” Rubio said. “We are increasingly taking away places where we can get away from it and interact in another realm.”
Rubio also commented on the hearings for Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh, citing politics as a complicating factor in the ultimate decision.
“This is for a position in the government, and the highest court of the land,” Rubio said. “That automatically drags politics into it.”
Many senators had already made their decisions to support or not support Kavanaugh prior to the release of the sexual assault allegations, according to Rubio.
“We should recognize that a significant number of senators that opposed Judge Kavanaugh opposed him before this even happened. They had already announced that they weren’t going to vote for him, obviously this doesn’t make them likelier to vote for him,” Rubio said. “Likewise, I would say that a significant number of senators who supported him had already announced that as well.”
Rubio said his decision on the Kavanaugh case is open to change depending on the results of the FBI investigation.
“You have to make decisions on what you know,” Rubio said. “What we know may or may not change over the next five or seven days, depending on how that process goes.”
Despite increasing polarization and the past week’s controversy, Rubio expressed pride in the United States and a hope for the country’s political future.
“Your business partners, your clients are just as likely to be halfway around the world as they are halfway across town and the ability to have grown up natively with the ability to collaborate with people far away and different from you is going to be one of the key currencies of success in the twenty first century,” Rubio said.

Juan Martinez (SFS ’20) became the first Latinx and undocumented president of the Georgetown University Student Association on Sept. 16 after former President Sahil Nair (SFS ’19) resigned on Sept. 11.
Martinez, the former transition chair of the Senate, became president per GUSA bylaws, due to vacancies in the positions of president, vice president and chief of staff, after the resignations of Naba Rahman (SFS ’19) and Aaron Bennett (COL ’19) on Sept. 14. Nair resigned Sept. 11 amid sexual misconduct allegations.
No complaints had been filed against Nair through the Title IX office or the Office of Student Conduct, he wrote in a May 28 email to The Hoya. A university spokesperson confirmed that, as of May 2019, Nair was not the subject of any complaints through either office nor had he been found responsible for any violations of the Student Code of Conduct.
Kenna Chick (SFS ’20), the former Chair of GUSA’s Mental Health Policy Team, was confirmed as Vice President on Oct. 2. She is the first person of East Asian descent to serve on the GUSA Executive team.
While excited to be the first Latinx GUSA president, Martinez’s appointment highlights a historical lack of representation of marginalized communities in GUSA and on campus, Martinez said in an interview with The Hoya.
“Just acknowledging the fact that there hasn’t been a Latinx president just speaks to the lack of representation that is in the leadership, and also just in general at this university, and in institutions outside of Georgetown and GUSA,” Martinez said. “There is such a lack of representation when it comes to people who hold not-privileged identities. And so while I wanted to be happy about it, I also had to confront the fact that it speaks volumes to the disadvantages that have historically been placed on marginalized communities.”
According to Martinez, he and Chick plan to focus on creating a more inclusive GUSA environment, especially for traditionally marginalized communities.
“I’ve been involved in GUSA since my freshman year as a senator, and since then, every year, I’ve made a big part of my platform ensuring that we’re reaching out to groups that are under-represented in GUSA such as people of color, or minority groups like people who are part of the LGBTQ community, non-cisgender identifying people,” Martinez said. “Now that I’m president, I’m going to continue doing that work to make sure that GUSA is not a space that is perceived to be exclusive to a certain demographic or a certain group of people.”
The lack of people of East Asian descent in leadership worries Chick, because diversity in executive decision-making is crucial, she said in an interview with The Hoya.
“It goes back to how representation is very, very important. I think that sometimes in terms of representation, there are very, very few East Asian people who are involved in policy and governing,” Chick said. “Just given that this is an opportunity, I think that it is important that we have a variety of different identities in office, and I think that those really do carry weight when it comes to policy-making.”
The circumstances surrounding the resignation of the previous administration made his sudden appointment as president bittersweet, Martinez said.
“There’s a lot of conflicting feelings that come from having to ascend to the presidency in this way. It obviously wasn’t something that was at all foreseen by anyone, and when it happened, a lot of people were congratulating me and telling me, ‘Oh, we’re so happy that you’re student body president now, and you’ll do a great job,’” he said. “ But, you know, a lot of bad stuff had to happen. A lot of events had to happen for me to be here, and not good events, so it’s really hard to say that I’m happy to be student body president.”
Martinez’ term will conclude with the election of the next GUSA executive, which typically occurs in the first week of March. Martinez is excited to give back to the Georgetown community and to support students to ensure that their needs are always primary.
“Given all the support I’ve gotten since my freshman year here, I’m glad to be in this position because it makes me feel able to give back to the student body and this university for the ways it’s supported me,” Martinez said. “ I acknowledge that the University has a lot of things it can change in better supporting students of different identities, and I will put in the work to recognize that they can do a lot of good, but also sometimes they need to be pushed a little bit to do that good for students.”

The Washington, D.C. Council voted 8-5 Tuesday to repeal Initiative 77, which would have gradually raised the minimum wage for tipped workers from $3.89 to match the standard minimum wage by 2026.
Initiative 77 was approved by District voters with a 56 percent majority in a June primary election, according to The Washington Post. The subsequent repeal efforts have sparked a larger philosophical debate on the extent to which District politicians are obligated to implement legislation directly sanctioned by the public.
The current minimum wage for non-tipped workers in the District is $13.25 per hour, and is set to increase incrementally until it reaches $15.00 per hour in July 2020. Like most states, D.C. allows employers to pay tipped workers, such as waiters and bartenders, less than the hourly minimum wage. Employers are required to cover the difference if total earnings after tips amount to less than the minimum wage.
Proponents of Initiative 77 argue that tipped workers deserve the financial security of a professional wage in addition to gratuities, arguing that some employers do not fairly compensate workers.
The repeal of Initiative 77 signals the District’s lack of support toward low-income and minority workers, Georgetown University College Democrats President Maria Cornell (SFS ’20) wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“Initiative 77 would ensure that workers in the service industry receive the full minimum wage, and it would close loopholes employers use to undermine workers compensation and rights,” Cornell wrote. “Initiative 77 would have especially helped low-income workers and families of color. The repeal of Initiative 77 would further evidence the District government’s neglect of underserved and marginalized communities.”
Detractors warn that higher wages for workers mean higher labor costs for employers, straining jobs in D.C.’s food services industry.
Proposals like Initiative 77 make it more difficult to find a food service job, Georgetown University College Republicans Director of External Affairs Rowan Saydlowski (COL ’21) wrote in an email to The Hoya, speaking on his personal experience.
“I spent the summer working in Los Angeles, where the tipped minimum wage is the same as the regular minimum wage, and it is near-impossible to get a job waiting tables unless you already have prior experience as a server,” Saydlowski wrote. “Whether you’re a student looking for a summer job or a mother of three without work experience, Initiative 77 could take the option of server completely off of the table.”
Among tipped employees, consensus has been limited. Some servers support wage increases to secure a more reliable income, while others worry the policy encourages an overall decline in tipping, according to The Washington Post.
The repeal billis set to undergo a standard 30-day review period and requires a signature from the mayor to be passed. Bowser has opposed Initiative 77 in the past and signaled she would sign a repeal in a Sept. 28 news release.
The overturn of Initiative 77 is a joint effort between the D.C. Council and the Bowser administration to protect workers, Bowser said at a media event in Dupont Circle Sept. 28.
“Sometimes the council gets it wrong and sometimes the voters get it wrong, and in both cases the council has the obligation to fix it,” Bowser said at the event. “I have consistently stood and spoke for D.C. workers who do not want to see their wages decreased, and that’s exactly what will happen if Initiative 77 goes into effect.”
D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D-At Large) defended the morality of overturning the initiative in a statement during a Sept. 17 hearing.
“If a law is a bad law it should be amended or repealed,” Mendelson said. “It doesn’t matter if the law was adopted by Congress, the voters, or ourselves.”
The D.C. Council attempted a last-minute compromise by incorporating parts of a proposed amendment by Councilmember Elissa Silverman (I-At Large).
The repeal legislation includes measures to address wage theft and sexual harassment in restaurants, but stopped short of Silverman’s goal of preserving Initiative 77 wage increases for tipped workers other than waiters and bartenders, according to The Washington Post.
Mendelson, along with Councilmembers Anita Bonds (D-At Large),David Grosso (I-At Large),Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), Brandon Todd (D-Ward 4), Kenyan McDuffie (D-Ward 5), Vincent Gray (D-Ward 7) and Trayon White Sr. (D-Ward 8) voted in favor of the repeal.
Silverman, along with Councilmembers Robert White Jr. (I-At Large), Brianne Nadeau (D-Ward 1), Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3) and Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) voted against the repeal.
“The city’s regular minimum wage is currently $13.25 but will reach $15 by 2020.”
“Initiative 77 would gradually hike the tipped minimum wage by $1.50 each year until it reaches $15 in 2025. By 2026, the minimum wage would be the same for all workers.”

The Catholic University of America suspended Dean Will Rainford Sept. 28 for tweets questioning the legitimacy of sexual assault allegations brought forward by Julie Swetnick and Christine Blasey Ford against Supreme Court Justice nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
Rainford suggested Kavanaugh was a victim of assault in a Sept. 26 tweet published under his official Twitter account for his position as official Dean of the National Catholic School of Social Service Twitter account, @NCSSSDean, which has since been deleted.
“Swetnick is 55 y/o. Kavanaugh is 52 y/o. Since when do senior girls hang with freshmen boys?” Rainford wrote in the tweet. “If it happened when Kavanaugh was a senior, Swetnick was an adult drinking with &by her admission, having sex with underage boys. In another universe, he would be victim & she the perp!”
More than one hundred students, alumni and members of Catholic University gathered in a campus protest Oct. 1 demanding the resignation of Rainford, according to The Washington Post.
In another tweet Sept. 26, Rainford questioned the validity of Ford’s accusations because of her initial decision to remain anonymous, and the later public disclosure of her identity.
“Riddle me this. Why would the accuser of Kavanaugh take a polygraph, paid for by someone else and administered by private investigator in early August, if she wanted to remain anonymous and had no intention of reporting the alleged assault?” Rainford wrote.
Rainford issued an apology Sept. 27 for his comments about Swetnick’s accusation, according to CNN.
“My tweet suggested that she was not a victim of sexual assault,” Rainford wrote. “I offer no excuse. It was impulsive and thoughtless and I apologize.”
CUA President John Garvey announced Rainford’s suspension in a Sept. 28 statement, writing that Rainford’s tweets do not reflect the values of CUA.
“We should expect any opinion he expresses about sexual assault to be thoughtful, constructive, and reflective of the values of Catholic University, particularly in communications from the account handle @NCSSSDean,” Garvey wrote. “While it was appropriate for him to apologize and to delete his Twitter and Facebook accounts, this does not excuse the serious lack of judgment and insensitivity of his comments.”
Associate Dean Marie Raber is serving as acting dean for the remainder of the semester, according to the statement.
CUA holds a neutral stance on the Kavanaugh hearings, but continues to support victims of sexual assault, Garvey wrote in the Sept. 28 statement.
“The Catholic University of America has no position on the Kavanaugh matter,” Garvey wrote. “But let there be no doubt that our University, and particularly our National Catholic School of Social Service, has a special concern for every victim and survivor of sexual assault.”
Garvey will review the case to repair damage and prevent similar future incident, according to the letter.
“The many letters and phone calls we have received this week have brought up a variety of issues regarding the direction of the school of social work,” Garvey wrote. “I have decided to direct a thorough review of these concerns, led by the Office of the Provost. The scope of the review will be to ensure that we have a clear understanding of the concerns, and to identify areas where we hope to see improvement.”

Religious anti-abortion language damages the pro-life movement, March for Life President Jeanne Mancini said at a panel Tuesday focusing on the intersection of politics, religion and the pro-abortion rights movement.
The event was hosted by the Georgetown University Knights of Columbus, Georgetown University College Republicans, the Francis Project, Catholic Women at Georgetown, the Lecture Fund and Georgetown University Right to Life.
John Carr, the director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life, moderated the discussion, which included Mancini, Reverend Monsignor John Enzler, the president and CEO of Catholic Charities and Charles Camosy, who is part of the leadership team for Democrats for Life and author of “Beyond the Abortion Wars: A Way Forward for a New Generation”
Philosophical arguments and anti-abortion campaigns are more effective than invoking religious language when discussing the pro-life position, Mancini said.
“I do think it’s the human rights abuse of our time, and I am comfortable using that language, although I totally respect coming at it from a theological perspective, which is even more beautiful than speaking from a philosophical perspective,” Mancini said. “But I think that in the public square, using the language of philosophy and natural law is a lot more effective.”
The politics of abortion feed into partisan division that discourages people from supporting the pro-life movement, even if they hold some of the requisite views, according to Camosy.
“The dominant pro-life movement is so tied to a kind of politics that young people are disproportionately rejecting, and young people don’t even identify themselves as pro-life, even though they hold views that you would call pro-life,” Camosy said.
Enzler expressed concerns that controversies about political and religious ideas surrounding abortion obscure the point of the pro-life movement, which she said is to protect unborn children.
“We can take this into politics and religion, but it’s not about politics and religion, it’s about an unborn baby. It’s really about human beings,” Enzler said. “We have a tendency to move away from the humanness of that.”
Democrats have neglected to consider the policy items of the pro-life movement, specifically in regards to abortion, according to Mancini.
“Abortion is the first social justice issue,” Mancini said. “Social justice begins in the womb, and Democrats are supposed to be the social justice party, but at this stage in the game this specific issue has become so nuanced in such a negative and false way that it’s like they won’t even touch it with a ten-foot pole. It really, really breaks my heart.”
Mancini said President Donald Trump won her support through his pro-life stance and rhetoric surrounding the topic.
“He became the first presidential candidate in the history of our country to talk about abortion in a way that was really hard to listen to—and very honest—and to me it meant a lot because candidates usually lack the courage to really address the issue, and he won my vote in that moment,” Mancini said.
Camosy agreed with Mancini that the Trump administration effectively overturned pro-choice policies through positive pro-life rhetoric.
Trump “has been way better on short-term and frankly reversible policies than I expected him to be and he deserves credit for that,” Camosy said.
Despite Camosy’s support for Trump’s pro-life policies, he said that the President should alter his attitude towards women and their role in the abortion issue.
“I don’t even think that we ought to talk about abortion without talking about women in the same sentence. And Trump is a complete disaster when it comes to women,” Camosy said.
Policies such as paid family leave that ease the burden of parenting could help the pro-life movement by reducing the demand for abortions, according to Camosy.
“We’re the only developed country in the world that doesn’t have some sort of paid family leave. We have hopelessly expensive childcare,” Camosy said. “We don’t have enough protections at work for women based on family status. So, these are all things that I think we can do in addition to trying to pass 20-week bans and waiting periods and everything.”
Pope Francis brought discussions about abortion into the mainstream for Catholics, allowing pro-life advocates to use religious language to complement their advocacy efforts, Camosy said.
“Pope Francis gives us the sense that we don’t need to check our faith at the door when talking about these things, we can have the gospel at the front of our lips, not at the back of our minds, and be effective,” Camosy said. “When we don’t do that, when we translate our language and our strategies into the ways that frankly, this town [D.C.] wants us to, I think we risk idolatry.”
Despite the partisan nature of the topic, Mancini said the pro-life movement still has the potential for success due to the position’s backing of the church.
“We’ve got truth. We’ve got beauty. We’ve got the incredible church’s teachings,” Mancini said.
