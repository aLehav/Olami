The university received an unprecedented $50 million donation today, the fourth-largest gift in its history and the largest in support of athletics.
The gift, made by Peter and Susan Cooper of Newport Beach, Calif., will bolster an existing athletics leadership program and fund renovations on the Multi-Sport Facility.
The three-year-old student leadership initiative will be renamed the Cooper Athletics Leadership Program, while the Multi-Sport Facility, which will be entirely renovated in around 12 to 18 months, will be renamed Cooper Field.
University President John J. DeGioia announced the donation in a university-wide email tonight, emphasizing the role CALP will play in supporting the education of Georgetown’s 750 student-athletes.
“The Coopers’ investment in our community will allow us to strengthen opportunities for students engaged in intercollegiate athletics and will help them prepare for leadership throughout their lives,” DeGioia wrote.
The Coopers’ five children attended Georgetown from 2002 to 2010. Four of the five children participated in varsity athletics, with three sons on the football team and one daughter on the swim team. In addition, Peter Cooper has served two terms on the university board of directors from 2001 to 2006 and 2007 to 2013.
Cooper said he and his wife realized the importance of developing leadership in student-athletes after their children had participated in the athletics program.
“Sue and I are thrilled to share in providing a leadership curriculum and experience for student-athletes. We believe that athletics and academics combine to provide an ideal crucible to create future leaders,” Peter Cooper wrote in a statement on the Georgetown Athletics website.
According to the university website, CALP will provide a four-year curriculum to educate student-athletes on elements of leadership, theories of influence and preprofessional skills. The donation will also fund research and professional development training for coaches.
CALP will house the existing Hoyas Lead, a university initiative founded in 2012 that provides academic guidance and support for student athletes. Assistant Athletics Director and Director of Student-Athlete Leadership and Development Mike Lorenzen will lead the CALP initiative, after having served as director of Hoyas Lead.
The Multi-Sport Facility will undergo renovations in its seating areas and locker rooms, in addition to other facility improvements.
In his email, DeGioia said that the field is central to the university community and the planning of on-campus construction.
“The Multi-Sport Field’s location in the heart of the campus is an important focus in our planning for the future,” DeGioia wrote. “As we work to create pathways that connect the academic, recreation and social hubs on campus, improvements to the Multi-Sport Field and the surrounding area will help bring our vision to reality, improving our physical spaces for all members of our university community.”
A full story will appear in Friday’s issue.

Oh goody, more money for sports. Not for improvements to the library or help for low-income students or for academics or anything like that, oh no. It has to be for sports and athletic leadership, whatever that means. I find it hilariously awful that this news comes right after the news of Georgetown’s plummet in rankings for ‘doing enough for low-income students.’
Yes, this family has the right to decide where they’d like their money to go, but I wish they had reconsidered athletics, or that the school had asked them to perhaps direct this to somewhere maybe a little more deserving…somewhere that’s not also getting a brand new facility very soon already.

For what it’s worth, many Georgetown athletes (10% of the school, let’s not forget) are from lower-income families, and many of them would never have been able to attend Georgetown without athletics.  I’m sure they will especially appreciate the ability to participate in leadership education and training that will enable them to succeed later in life.  For generations, sports have been a means of achieving a more diverse campus, and while many colleges have over-emphasized athletics and gone too far down the path of professionalization and money-making, one can hardly say that about Georgetown’s non-scholarship football program or any of its other non-revenue sports (men’s basketball being the only sport that turns a profit).
The MSF as it exists today is an eyesore, and a heavily used one by varsity and club sports and other student uses.  Turning that facility into something worthy of the heart of Georgetown’s campus strikes me as a worthwhile venture, especially when we’re talking about only $10 million (the stadium cost), as compared to the $500 million the University has set as the fundraising goal specifically for financial aid and the $1 billion in the rest of the campaign for other University initiatives.
The New York Times rankings for doing enough for low-income students have some good data behind them, but their methodology leaves a lot to be desired.  For instance, they rank Moody Bible College at #25, 1 better than Yale, even though it costs #13,000 per year more than Yale for a middle income student (the group studied).  And no one in their right mind would say the level of education at Yale is below that of MBC. So take those rankings with a big grain of salt.

“The MSF as it exists today is an eyesore, and a heavily used one by varsity and club sports and other student uses.”
What exactly is wrong with the Harbin MSF? If I were a donor intending to support the athletics program here at Georgetown, I would much prefer to fix the serious hazard posed by Kehoe Field rather than expanding the MSF’s capacity when rarely fill it anyway and it’s already fairly new. Kehoe is in desperate need of replacement and we have exactly 0 outdoor tennis courts on campus now; both of those problems seem like they should be fixed before we start worrying about whether we need more seats for the one day a year when the Harbin MSF bleachers are full.
Then again though, it’s the Cooper family’s money and they’re entitled to do whatever they want with it. I just think there are better uses for that money even if they specifically want to improve the athletics situation on campus.

It’s an unfinished facility with temporary stands that were never meant to be used for years full-time.  It has no permanent restroom facilities, requiring the use of unsightly and undignified portapotties.  It has no concession facilities, leaving provisions to an embarassing tent staffed by Paradise Ice Cream that has an improvised food preparation setup that churns out barely edible junk. It has no locker rooms, forcing the Hoyas to dress in McShane Lounge – a sadder solution than 98% of high school teams face.  It has no permanent paving, instead using gravel that is unstable and potentially dangerous for those wearing heels, using crutches or wheelchairs, etc.  It is surrounded by ugly chain link fence and does not integrate well into the heart of campus from a pedestrian perspective, lacking sidewalk on the side facing Harbin.  It has ramshackle temporary press boxes with jury-rigged wiring.  It has less seating capacity than any other football field in Division I. 
Should I keep going?

After an election season marked by low voter participation, 28 students, including three write-in candidates, were sworn into the Georgetown University Student Association senate Sunday.
Nineteen percent of the undergraduate population, around 1,252 students, voted in the election, in which 46 students campaigned to serve as at-large senators and representatives of the 11 residence-based districts. Last year’s voter turnout was 25 percent.
The GUSA Election Commission posted results on Twitter early Friday morning after a 24-hour online voting window Thursday. Election winners were sworn in at a ceremony Sunday before taking part in their first senate meeting.
According to the Election Commission’s Twitter page, the Freshman South district, which consists of New South Hall and Village C West, had the highest turnout with 46 percent, followed by 36 percent in Freshman North, which includes Darnall Hall and Harbin Hall.
These figures were twice that of upperclassman districts. LXR, Off Campus and Village A had the lowest voter turnouts at 5 percent, 7 percent and 9 percent, respectively.
Correspondingly, Freshman South and North also had the highest number of candidates. Due to a technical glitch, the Freshman North results were delayed until Sunday.
Election Commission Vice Chair Grady Willard (SFS ’18) said that student interest in GUSA elections is typically lower for senate elections but spikes during executive elections.
“Turnout is always very light in the fall,” Willard said. “In the spring, we elect the president and the vice president, and everyone gets really involved in that, so there will be high turnout.”
For the LXR, Off-Campus and Townhouse districts, which did not have official candidates on the ballot, residents wrote in the student of their choice. The seats were filled by Michael Fiedorowicz (COL ’18), Owen Coffin (COL ’16) and Elizabeth Oh (SFS ’16), respectively.
All three write-in candidates indicated their agreement to serving on the senate, which eliminates the need for a special election.
Willard said he would have preferred traditional campaigns over write-in candidates.
“One of our disappointments is that we didn’t have candidates file for every seat,” Willard said. “It’s always better to see candidates running than write-ins.”
Oh and Fiedorowicz decided to run as write-in candidates, because they did not plan to participate until late into campaign week.
Oh, who previously served as GUSA Chair of Intellectual Life, said that she did not anticipate running for the position.
“When other senators told me that no one had officially run for Townhouses, I just asked my friends to vote for me and hoped for the best,” Oh wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In her position, Oh said that she will work on the continued expansion of mental health resources, sexual assault policy reform and improved townhouse maintenance.
Coffin said that he was unaware that his name was being circulated as a write-in candidate until the results were announced. GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff Ken Nunnenkamp (MSB ’16), Coffin’s roommate, orchestrated the campaign to elect him
“I found out when someone messaged me at 2:37 a.m. to congratulate me,” Coffin wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I thought it was funny and immediately asked my roommates who were up if they had anything to do with it.”
After a tweet confirmed his election to the post, Coffin said that he was initially unsure of whether or not to accept it.
“I decided it couldn’t hurt, though,” Coffin wrote. “I hope to bring to GUSA the voice of the student who doesn’t want anything to do with it, which is a lot of us.”
Nunnenkamp said that he was proud of the successful campaign.
“When the opportunity arose to serve as his campaign manager for a riveting 22 hours, I jumped at the chance,” Nunnenkamp wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We worked so hard, came so far and got Owen the win he truly deserved … I think his victory says everything about the future of GUSA.”
Despite his unconventional victory, Coffin said he still hopes to improve GUSA and bring an outsider’s view to the senate.
“I hope to improve GUSA by giving a true outsider’s opinion, free from the bias of those who thought that the best way to affect campus life is through GUSA,” Coffin wrote. “I want to give the perspective of those student leaders who operate in all the spheres outside of GUSA and make an impact on campus.”
Among the other new senators is Freshman South representative Ben Baldwin (SFS ’19).
Baldwin said that he hopes he can collaborate with the other senators to improve the freshman experience.
“I know a lot of kids have been excited about reforming the meal plans, and of course [having] greater opportunities for diversity and cultural groups,” Baldwin said. “I want to … make sure all our dorms are really connected so we can build a freshman identity.”
GUSA Vice President Connor Rohan advised future candidates to improve their campaigning strategies.
“I guess students running for the senate should have used higher resolution photos for their posters,” Rohan wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Senator At-Large and GUSA Student Life Chair Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) was reelected to GUSA after two years of experience.
Khan said that one of the senate’s goals this year is to remodel the Finance and Appropriations Committee.
“There isn’t much of a strong relationship between the Fin/App representatives and the advisory boards that they represent,” Khan said. “One goal for this year is to change that, and to make a more direct line of communication.”
Khan also said that she is excited to work with a group of students from different backgrounds in the senate.
“This is actually a more diverse group of senators this year,” Khan said. “We have a lot of committees historically not represented. … It’s a great year for the senate to rebuild itself.”

The Council of the District of Columbia is currently considering the Neighborhood Engagement Achieves Results Act, which would attempt to reduce violent crime by approaching it as an issue of public health, instead of increasing police presence.
The bill was initially introduced at the first council meeting of the 2015-16 legislative year Sept. 22.
Nearly 70 public witnesses, the Metropolitan Police Department Chief, the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety and the Justice and Department of Health Director testified before the council’s Committee on the Judiciary and 11 of the council’s 13 members.
Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie (D-Ward 5), the bill’s primary sponsor, presented the major goals of the bill at the meeting.
“We have to recalibrate how we look at public safety, which means we have to address not just the symptoms of violent crime but also look to prevent and treat the root causes of violent crime in a long-term, sustainable way,” McDuffie said. “What’s clear is that we cannot arrest our way out of this problem.”
The bill has five specific goals, the most significant of which would establish an Office on Neighborhood Engagement and Safety. This office would identify 50 local individuals who are particularly at risk of committing a violent crime based on past criminal records and guide them through various forms of cognitive-based therapy to discourage future criminal activity.
In a forum on public health held Sept. 16, Councilmember Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), former policy director of the D.C. Primary Care Association, also supported a health-centered approach to reducing violence.
“That’s my background — in public health — and in public health you don’t just diagnose and have one prescription and that’s it,” Allen said. “It’s a very community-based model of how you go about impacting not just a person but a community.”
Another goal of the bill is to establish an Office of Violence Prevention through the Department of Health. This office would be charged with using resources through the Department of Human Services to combat the public health factors such as addiction and mental illness that often lead to violence.
At the forum, Nesbitt described key triggers for future violent tendencies, including past experiences with bullying or neglect, self-esteem issues, academic history and interpersonal skills.
The Act would also address new methods of local policing through the Metropolitan Police Department. The MPD would work with the Department of Behavioral Health and the Department of Human Services to make social workers and counselors more available to those who are impacted by violent crime. Officers would also undergo further annual training on the use of force in arrests and the prevention of biased-based policing.
MPD Chief Cathy Lanier highlighted local law enforcement’s support of the bill in the council meeting.
“Members of the community, no matter where you live, want to be part of the change,” Lanier said. “They are tired of upticks or spikes in violence at any time and they want to be part of the solution. And we feel that in MPD.”
The MPD would also be responsible for collecting more data from “stop-and-frisk” searches and on the use of force in arrests. This includes determining whether or not the search was consensual and if police seized any property. The gender and race of the individual stopped will also be recorded.
Additionally, the bill would amend the current Office of Police Complaints. This office would monitor the impact of citizen complaints more closely, including documenting details such as the discharge of any firearm that resulted in injury during an arrest.
“We also know that measures that make the police department more transparent lead to increased community trust, a key element in the effectiveness of any community policing strategy,” McDuffie said at the council meeting.
Finally, the Act would award the deputy mayor of public safety and justice grant-making authority, which could simplify the process by which grassroots crime prevention organizations receive funding. In doing so, McDuffie and his fellow co-sponsors are hoping to encourage sustainable crime prevention at the neighborhood level.
While violent crime is rare on Georgetown’s campus, Chief of Georgetown University Police Department Jay Gruber said the involvement of public services in policing is an important step toward safety.
“I think it’s great, I think it’s not just up to the police,” Gruber said. “It’s not just up to the criminal justice system to try to reduce crimes and violence. I think that there needs to be a more holistic approach and getting all of these different government agencies together to look at the problem in a different way will be very helpful.”
The bill is under review in the Committee on Health and Human Services and Committee on Judiciary and will face a vote in the next few months.

Georgetown partnered with the White House Smart Cities Initiative on Sept. 14, joining the MetroLab Network, a program that aims to promote university and city collaboration across the nation.
The White House Office of Science and Technology launched the MetroLab Network during the White House Smart Cities Forum. Twenty-eight universities in 21 cities have joined the network, which includes The George Washington University and Howard University, although no specific projects for Georgetown have been planned yet.
Vice President for Government Relations and Community Engagement Chris Murphy said the initiative is still in its early stages.
“Part of the key is that it is very early in the formation of the project,” Murphy said. “We are very much looking forward to working with the city and figuring out where the overlap is between the city’s needs and the university’s areas to contribute.”
Murphy said that as both cities and universities are constantly evolving, they are looking to data analysis to identify potential improvements.
“I think it’s only natural that the city would want to partner with us to help achieve their goals and give Georgetown an opportunity to flex its muscles with data analysis,” Murphy said. “Georgetown has been having conversations about gathering and analyzing data for a long time, and this is an opportunity to partner with the city in a more structured way.”
The entire White House initiative, which includes the MetroLab Network, is a $160 million investment in federal research addressing urban issues regarding economic growth, health, safety and energy.
The MetroLab program is particularly focused on improving infrastructure, city services and other areas of the public sector through university-city collaboration, according to the MetroLab Network website.
“The Network will focus on common challenges facing cities in order to develop shared, scalable solutions that can be deployed across the network,” the website reads.
Uwe Brandes, professor and the executive director of the master’s program in urban and regional planning, will lead the university’s involvement in the initiative once plans begin to take shape.
Brandes explained that part of the university’s research will focus on information technologies and how they are changing collaboration with city governments.
“At its core it involves using new sources of information in a tactile manner,” Brandes said. “It means asking: How do communities advance their goals and agendas though the new wave of digitally generated information?”
He added that although the program is still in an early developmental stage, it will build on Georgetown’s relationship with the greater
D.C. area.
“It is an opportunity to make new connections between undergraduates, graduates and faculty members, both with our colleagues at other universities and with the city,” Brandes said. “This isn’t the creation of an entirely new initiative within Georgetown. It will connect with other activities already occurring at the university.”
Murphy added that the partnership is an opportunity for Georgetown to become more involved with the movement toward addressing key urban challenges.
“As the project develops, we will have a better sense about how faculty and students can be engaged,” Murphy said. “This is an opportunity to directly plug into the city’s priorities in a meaningful way. Cities are grappling with how to use the data they have and how to analyze and think about data differently. D.C. has the opportunity to be at the forefront of this movement that is undoubtedly going to spread throughout the country.”
Brandes said that the involvement of city and university partnerships in the initiative distinguishes the program from conventional research and the broader “big data” conversation.
“Part of the effort is to bring more academic discipline to a dialogue that is largely being had outside the university,” Brandes said. “The goal for the partnership is to bring like-minded individuals together and advance the state of applied research in the field. It is a big work in progress, and now marks that time where we are beginning to roll up our sleeves and define what this really is.”

With the participation of more than 500 members of the community, Georgetown won the Car Free Day College Campus Challenge, a competition between five universities in the Washington, D.C. region designed to encourage students, faculty and administrators to reduce their automobile use.
In its seventh year, the Car Free Day event, which is coordinated by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, encourages participants to take the metro, walk, bike or carpool in lieu of driving to campus.
Georgetown won the challenge Tuesday by amassing ten times as many pledges than last year’s competition which the university also won.
Five other universities, including George Mason University, The University of Maryland, American University, The George Washington University and the University of the District of Columbia, also participated in the challenge.
Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Christopher Augostini invited members of the community to sign the pledge in a university-wide email on Sept. 21, one day before the challenge.
In the email, Augostini encouraged students to use the bicycle racks in front of Lauinger Library and Red Square which were installed three weeks ago.
Director of the Office of Sustainability Audrey Stewart said that the event aligns with Georgetown’s sustainability programs.
“What’s really great about Car Free Day is that it provides a simple and effective way to raise awareness and engagement on sustainable transportation options,” Stewart wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Its goals closely align with Georgetown’s sustainability values and with the university’s ongoing efforts to maximize sustainable transportation choices for the campus community.”
According to Stewart, multiple administrative offices collaborated with the Office of Sustainability to increase the number of pledges from students.
“Georgetown’s participation in Car Free Day is a team effort between many offices and departments across campus who come together to help raise awareness and get the word out to members of the campus community,” Stewart wrote.
Stewart also said that the program provides many benefits for D.C. residents.
“Car Free Day … encourages people to get around by more sustainable modes of transportation,” Stewart wrote. “[This helps] to reduce traffic congestion, decrease air pollution and support healthier communities.”
Georgetown University Student Association Secretary of Sustainability Caroline James (COL ’16) said that although the challenge did not involve most undergraduates, who do not commute, it effectively helped to promote sustainable modes of transportation.
“I can imagine that students’ main reaction when seeing that Georgetown had the most pledges for the car free challenge is the irony that undergraduates are not allowed to have cars on campus,” James said. “However, we have to remember that Car Free Day was not about winning a competition or going car -ree for just a day. Clearly, its mission is to have us examine our own transit situation and habits.”
Gregory Miller (SFS ’14), an office manager in the School of Foreign Service Dean’s Office who participated in the challenge, said that the win shows that Georgetown has made progress in its sustainability efforts.
“Georgetown has made a lot of progress in recent years to encourage alternative and active forms of commuting by steadily improving on-campus infrastructure and resources,” Miller said.
However, Miller said that the late promotion of the event may have led to a lower participation rate.
“[The] lack of concrete day-of programming to help commuters switch from single-occupancy car trips to transit or active commuting gives the impression that the university does not care about creating real change,” Miller said.
Miller recommended that for future Car Free days, Georgetown should begin publicizing the event earlier.
“Georgetown needs to provide more resources for people to plan to go car-free, instead of sending out an email the night before when commuters don’t have time to make the arrangements to change their commuting habits,” Miller said.
Miller said that the university should further increase its efforts to create a more sustainable campus.
“I think that the next step is for Georgetown to start being proactive and thinking outside its gates to improve the safety and accessibility of the surrounding transportation infrastructure,” Miller said.

The Center for Student Engagement, Outdoor Education and the Office of Sustainability collaborated to create HoyaCycle, a bicycle rental pilot program, that launched Sept. 25.
The program will enter a trial period from now until the end of the fall semester. Students will be granted access to 10 bikes, which were donated by Coca-Cola, an official university partner since the early 1990s. The offices will work with the students to determine if the program should be implemented on a larger scale in the future.
“Bicycling is a great example of an integrated sustainability solution [among] people, planet and prosperity,” Director of the Office of Sustainability Audrey Stewart said. “It helps reduce emissions, it’s affordable and it supports an active, healthy lifestyle.”
The HoyaCycle bicycle rental program is the first bike sharing program of its kind on campus. Although Capital Bikeshare provides a similar service to students, Outdoor Education Director Kris Nessler said HoyaCycle is intended to localize the concept for Georgetown student usage.
“We’ve always had students expressing interest in developing a bike share like this,” Nessler said. “We wanted to experiment and see if there was a different formula that would work here.”
The program’s future will depend on how much each bicycle is used by the students. Program directors will check the mileage on the bicycles every week to this end.
“We’re hoping to figure out if a bike share would work on campus,” Nessler said. “This semester we’re really just trying … to see if students are in fact going to utilize [bikes] to get around Washington, D.C.”
According to Stewart, the idea for HoyaCycle arose several years ago during discussions on sustainability at Hoya Roundtable events. However, the idea did not take hold until last year, after student applied for 10 Coca Cola-donated bicycles in the Office of Sustainability.
The program was funded by donations from outside companies and advocacy groups. Nessler said a challenge moving forward will be receiving funding, which will depend on student use on a permanent basis from the university.
“If we’re able to prove that the program was utilized this semester, we will have a better opportunity to … find some dollars potentially for it,” Nessler said.
Since the pilot program began so recently, Nessler explained that there has not been enough time to check any bike mileage to gauge its success. However, Nessler said he was pleased with the initial reaction of the students who volunteered to participate.
“The students who picked them up last Friday were super excited and grateful to be grabbing those shiny new red bikes to get around D.C.,” Nessler said. “We’re hoping that the responses will be positive as the program continues.”
Echoing similar sentiments, Stewart said she hopes that this pilot program will inspire students and administrators to adopt more sustainable habits in the future. Stewart praised the program’s commitment to environmentally friendly means of transportation.
“The program aims to enhance the university’s ongoing bicycle-friendly initiatives,” Stewart said. “All the partners involved are looking forward to what we’ll learn from it.”
Bridget Stanton (COL ’18), an avid bike rider interested in joining the pilot program, said she hopes HoyaCycle will raise awareness of the feasibility of using bicycles as a mode of transport.
“Biking makes it really easy for me to get around school and the city quickly,” Stanton said. “It’s also a good form of exercise.”
Clarification: An earlier version of the article wrote that students lobbied for the Office of Sustainability to convince Coca Cola to donate 10 bicycles. The students from HoyaCycle had to submit an application for the bicycles.

Chemistry professor Christian Wolf and theater professor and Artistic Director of the Davis Performing Arts Center Derek Goldman will receive the President’s Awards for Distinguished Scholar-Teachers from University President John J. DeGioia at the Fall Faculty Convocation next Wednesday.
Since 2013, the distinction has been given annually to recognize excellence in faculty research and teaching. Recipients are selected through nomination and selection processes that involve all faculty members.
DeGioia announced the winners in a university-wide email last Friday, praising the two professors’ contributions to their respective departments.
According to Senior Advisor to the President for Faculty Relations Lisa Krim, there has been a diverse range of faculty members who have won this award.
“In the first two years, the faculty came from wide-ranging fields: history, pharmacology, law, mathematics and pathology,” Krim wrote in an email to The Hoya.
While all faculty members can submit nominations, a committee comprised of senior faculty members and previous award winners creates a shortlist of professors for DeGioia, who makes the final decision from the recommended candidates. Eligible nominees are generally tenured or clinician track scholars.
Wolf, who joined Georgetown in 2000, teaches both undergraduate and graduate chemistry courses, including Organic Chemistry I and II, an advanced course in synthesis and graduate courses on synthesis and stereochemistry.
In his email announcing the winners, DeGioia commended Wolf for inspiring students who are interested in chemistry.
“[Wolf] has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to his students’ learning, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, inspiring many to go on to make their own contributions in the field,” DeGioia wrote.
In addition to teaching, Wolf participated in groundbreaking research in the chiral compound field of organic chemistry.
“Our research is dealing with the making and analysis of organic compounds that are all chiral. Chiral compounds are compounds that exist in the form of non super-imposable mirror images, like our hands,” Wolf said.
Wolf said that he appreciates how the award combines both teaching and research in its selection criteria.
“What I like about this award is that it looks at the whole picture of research and teaching, which in my opinion, belong together. When I do research, I do it with my students,” Wolf said.
Goldman, a theater professor who also serves as founding director of the Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics, joined the university faculty 11 years ago.
DeGioia praised Goldman for his involvement in various performing arts initiatives at Georgetown.
“Professor Goldman’s unparalleled vision, spirit of collaboration and dedication to our students has enriched our community in deep and lasting ways over the course of his time teaching and directing in the Department of Performing Arts,” DeGioia wrote.
Goldman said that he was surprised by the number of students who were passionate about both politics and theater when he first arrived at Georgetown.
“Georgetown has surpassed my expectations in every way because I knew that it was a great university with an international footprint. … I didn’t realize the degree to which students would lead with a dual passion for theater and politics,” Goldman said.
Goldman founded LGPP with Distinguished Professor in the Practice of Diplomacy Cynthia Schneider in 2013 as a means of fostering collaboration with other performing arts institutions around the world. Since it was launched, the LGPP has organized dozens of international performances and workshops.
“Theater is incredibly local on one level. … But it is also connecting the intimately local with the global. Global theater is about what is already global and diverse in the room with you,” Goldman said.
Goldman said that he finds his work at Georgetown meaningful.
“It has been a great mid-life, mid-career learning experience for me … to be able to have projects that are really exploring why theater matters in 2015, what it offers that other art forms don’t, particularly in the landscape of politics and social change.”
Both recipients attributed their success to the students and faculty with whom they work at Georgetown.
“I was very surprised, gratified and humbled because I think theater is so collaborative and it is impossible to think of this work without a whole range of colleagues. … I really share the award with all the people I get to do this work with,” Goldman said.

In commemoration of the 25th anniversary of German reunification, former World Bank President Robert Zoellick and former German Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel discussed the continued implications of the reunification at the sixth installment of the Herbert Quandt lecture series in Gaston Hall Thursday.
Hosted by the BMW Center for German and European Studies, the Hanns-Seidel Foundation and the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung Washington Office, the event marked the first Quandt lecture in six years. The series was established by the CGES in 1997 to promote dialogue on German-American relations.
School of Foreign Service Dean Joel Hellman introduced the two speakers, both of whom were involved in the aftermath of the reunification. Zoellick was the primary negotiator for the United States in the Two-Plus-Four Agreement that created a sovereign German state, while Waigel led efforts to establish the euro in the 1990s.
Chair of the Hanns-Seidel Foundation Ursula Männle and Deputy Chief of Mission of the German Embassy Phillip Ackerman also joined the discussion as guest speakers.
All speakers recognized the key role that the United States, under former President George H.W. Bush, played in the unification of East and West Germany.
“There can’t be any doubt that without the support and help of Washington, it would have been much more difficult to achieve German unification,” Männle said. “This was primarily possible because the United States stood by Germany and gave their full support for unification.”
Waigel said that the establishment of a common currency united the previously separated country.
“It was a stellar effort performed in a short period of time,” Waigel said.
Because the currency treaty was signed in 1990, Waigel said that Germany has seen significant changes to both its political and economic landscape.
“[The press conference that followed] was facilitated by a shy, somewhat reserved lady who was a deputy press spokesman for [East Germany]. Her name was Angela Merkel. That too shows how much things have changed,” Waigel said.
According to Waigel’s calculations, the reunification has cost Germany 1.5 to 2.1 trillion throughout the past 25 years. However, in retrospect, Waigel called the monetary union and the unification “a masterpiece of diplomacy.”
Zoellick, who worked closely with Waigel during the reunification, was responsible for garnering support for the German unification process in the U.S. government.
Zoellick said that the reunification occurred primarily due to the haste with which the negotiating parties acted on the opportunity.
“This was an opening. This was an opportunity. People had to act fast,” Zoellick said.
However, Zoellick said that Germany continues to be confronted with many issues 25 years after the reunification.
“Germany now has still many challenges, but it has a rare and unique opportunity to shape the future of Europe and to shape the future of the transatlantic community,” Zoellick said.
Zoellick attributed some of these issues to the diplomatic relationship between Germany and the United States since the reunification.
“I think this is due to shortfalls on both sides, and both sides taking advantage of each other. I believe, this is [going to be] one of the challenges for the next U.S. president, to sit down with German colleagues and recognize each other’s perspectives, especially the different perspectives,” Zoellick said.
In a question-and-answer session following the lecture, audience members asked questions about the volatility of the European economy and currency today, as well as the professional preparation that allowed Waigel and Zoellick to be at the forefront of the reunification.
Waigel attributed his involvement in the reunification to his longstanding belief in the opportunity for German unity, while Zoellick credited his participation to his knowledge of history, the diplomatic process and calculated risk-taking.
Ann-Kathrin Merz (SFS ’19), who attended the event, said it demonstrated the continued relevance of the reunification.
“It’s amazing to think that it’s only been 25 years since Germany was reunified, and to see how real and still powerful this topic is for these politicians and speakers and all of these people who lived through,” Merz said.

As part of the Cornerstones Initiative introduced this year by District of Columbia Public Schools, all Washington, D.C., public school second-graders will be taught how to ride a bike.
Cornerstones aims to provide all DCPS students in a particular grade level with the same educational experience, streamlining the curriculums. It provides specific sets of lessons that introduce students from every grade to a range of topics, from second- graders riding bikes in physical education classes to high school students building fuel cells in chemistry.
With the help of the District Department of Transportation and private donors, DCPS purchased 1,000 bikes that will rotate between every elementary school each quarter of the academic year.
Bike use in the District is growing rapidly, with bike sharing gaining popularity. According to The Washington Post, approximately 4 percent of District residents commuted to work by bike in 2014, placing D.C. in the top five cities nationally.
However, in wards 7 and 8, which have higher concentrations of low-income residents, DCPS is concerned that children are not learning to ride because the areas have fewer bike lanes and less access to bikes.
DCPS Chancellor Kaya Henderson said Cornerstones is an initiative that seeks to provide equal education for all students, regardless of their place of residence and school.
“Challenging curriculum has always been part of DCPS’ strategy, but going forward, students will receive the same high-quality learning experience, no matter where they live or go to school,” Henderson said in a statement posted on the DCPS website.
Hyde-Addison Elementary School, located in Georgetown, is one of the first schools to receive bikes and begin teaching second-graders to ride.
Hyde-Addison PE teacher Rocky Parish spoke about how the second-graders are learning the basics.
“We glide,” Parish said. “So they push off with both feet, and when they push off with both feet about at the 2- to 5- feet mark, they put their feet down even if they don’t need to, because they’re still a little afraid of falling.”
Each component of the course is prescribed by DCPS to ensure that students across the city have a uniform experience—a key aspect of Cornerstones. The program aims to have all students riding bikes after four classes. This number, however, is flexible depending on how the second-graders progress.
Students will learn not only how to ride a bike but also how to be safe riders, This includes lessons on how to correctly put on a helmet and check that a bike is safe to use. The culminating project of the course is a class bike ride.
“For safety reasons, I’m going to make sure that the kids understand the rules, they understand safety, they understand how to ride the bikes,” Parish said. “The end goal is for me to take each [class] —there’s two second grades here— the end goal is to take them on about a 7.7-mile bike ride.”
Hyde-Addison Principal Elizabeth Namba said the introduction of Cornerstones has been beneficial for students and teachers alike. Namba said that the evidence of success is in the students’ reactions.
“I had a little girl, who said to me this week … ‘I am so happy, I just learned how to ride a bike,’” Namba said. “And to me that’s just amazing. That all kids will learn this life skill. It truly is something that I think is just wonderful for the kids.”
Parish highlighted the merits of the program in providing students the opportunity to learn this life skill.
“The benefit of the Cornerstone is giving not only the kids that know how to ride bikes the opportunity to share what they know themselves with other ones that don’t, but [also] the ones that don’t have the opportunity to ride bikes for whatever reason,” Parish said. “I guess you could say it evens the playing field to give everyone the opportunity to learn how to ride [a] bike.”
According to Parish, learning to ride has been a generally enjoyable experience for the second-graders.
“They love it,” Parish said. “I actually was shocked; even the ones that didn’t know how to ride the bikes, they’re just so eager to get on them. So it’s been positive all around.“

Nigerian entrepreneur Igho Sanomi discussed the rise of entrepreneurship and the challenges faced by business owners in Africa at an event in the Mortara Center on Wednesday.
Sponsored by the School of Foreign Service and the African studies department, the event focused on Sanomi’s own experience with building a business in Africa and the various obstacles that African entrepreneurs often encounter.
Sanomi grew up in Nigeria and pursued a degree in geology before entering the energy sector. In 2004, Sanomi formed Taleveras Group, an energy conglomerate that trades crude oil, jet fuel and petroleum gas. The group’s success launched Sanomi into the public spotlight, and he was profiled in Forbes in 2007. Since then, his company has become one of the largest suppliers of crude oil in West Africa.
African Studies Program Director Scott Taylor, who moderated the conversation, introduced Sanomi’s background as relevant to students.
“Sanomi is part of the new generation of African businessmen that are engaging in all kinds of ventures,” Taylor said. “Because he’s so young, a lot of our students can identify with him and find his story fascinating in the field of African studies and business.”
Sanomi said that his interest in the energy business was piqued when he visited an oil and gas trading company in Lagos, Nigeria, with his friend.
“My journey in the oil and gas business began in the final year of my university,” Sanomi said. “The experience I had in one day actually triggered the passion and the interest I had in the energy business.”
Sanomi also discussed the important role his father played during his initial years working in the energy sector.
“[My father] gave me the moral support that I needed and always taught me to stay humble and focus,” Sanomi said. “He always used to say to me, ‘Always consider your personal integrity and your Catholic faith as your guiding principle in life.’”
Despite the current success of Taleveras Group, Sanomi needed to overcome various obstacles in order to achieve his goals. He argued that these barriers in Nigeria and other African countries continue to deter aspiring entrepreneurs.
“One of the biggest challenges is government bureaucracy and policy inconsistencies,” Sanomi said. “Coupled with the issue of investment funding … it can be very expensive to acquire such investor confidence.”
Sanomi also said that a lack of basic utilities hinders the ability of entrepreneurs to start their own companies. Without essential infrastructure, Sanomi argued, Africa cannot compete against other well-developed markets.
“Africa lacks necessary basic infrastructure like electricity, energy, information technology and telecommunications services,” Sanomi said. “They are developing, but their current state poses barriers to our future business leaders and entrepreneurs.”
In his closing remarks, Sanomi said he is optimistic about the entrepreneurial spirit in Africa. He said that he hopes his experience and influence can shape the future generations of African business leaders.
“We’ve seen a lot of stability in the political space, the drive against [corruption] and the alignment of factors that will lead toward the path of greatness,” Sanomi said. “It can only get better.”
After the speech, Taylor discussed the development issues in Africa, namely the new role that economic liberalization plays.
As a professor of political economy, Taylor said that Sanomi’s story is an interesting portrayal of the effects of market liberalization in an African nation.
“Economic liberalization in Africa has been a double-edged sword,” Taylor said. “We’ve seen liberalization lead a dynamic shift in places such as Nigeria, where there is tremendous poverty, but also tremendous entrepreneurial spirit and human capacity.”
Students who attended the event commented on Sanomi’s humility and eagerness to change the negative perceptions surrounding African businesses.
John Hyman (MSB ’17) said he appreciated the importance of Taleveras Group in its efforts to change global perspectives on business opportunities in Africa. 
“Igho Sanomi has a well-known success story, and it’s an honor to have him here to talk to us about his journey,” Hyman said. “I appreciate how he is trying to counter the still too widely held perceptions that Africa still has a long way to go in terms of business success.”
Rohan Asrani (MSB ’17) also enjoyed the discussion and said that Sanomi’s story and optimism for Africa resonated with his own views on the economic development within the continent.
“The way Mr. Sanomi lays it out, Africa’s future is bright,” Asrani said. “If we can have more inspirational leaders like Mr. Sanomi come to Georgetown … it will improve the perceptions of Africa.”
