When Georgetown’s new mascot John B. Carroll arrives on campus today, he will have only six handlers, down from approximately 20 Jack Crew members who cared for the former mascot-in-training, Jack Jr.
“We’ve agreed to cut down the Jack Crew because it is unhealthy for the dog to have so many masters, especially when he is just getting used to his new surroundings,” Paul O’Neill (CAS ’86), chief operating officer for advancement and a member of the Bulldog Advisory Committee, said last week.
According to Jack Crew members, the reduced size reflects a desire to focus on the consistency of the new mascot’s training. The large size of J.J.’s Jack Crew may have adversely affected his training.
“It’s sad that Jack’s Crew is smal-ler — it reduces the opportunity for students to be on it,” Jack Crew member Rachel Grocock (SFS ’14) said. “At the same time, the focus is on the well-being of the mascot. Part of the reason we had some training issues with J.J. was he was dealing with so many different people all of the time. This way he knows which people he’s responsible to.”
Though the current Jack Crew members care for Jack, the 10-year-old dog does not need to be walked as often as he once did, according to Georgetown University Student Association Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14), a member of the Jack Crew and the BAC.
The six remaining Jack Crew members were informed about the decision on Monday. Ramadan said that after a period of adjustment to campus life, the Jack Crew may be expanded again.
Members of the Jack Crew expressed disappointment at the decision but excitement that the bulldog tradition is set to continue.
“The trimming down is hard because a lot of kids feel passionately about our bulldog tradition, and the decision to reduce the crew leaves them feeling underappreciated and out of the loop,” Jack Crew member Laura Narefsky (COL ’14) said. “However, I’m grateful that we will again have a live bulldog mascot present on campus, and I’m excited to work with the puppy.”
All six remaining members of the Jack Crew are upperclassmen, who generally have more experience in the group and more flexibility in their schedules, according to BAC member and Head of Jack Crew Nevada Schadler (COL ’15).
“Trimming down the crew was best for the puppy, and every student helper wants what’s best for our mascot,” Schadler said. “Giving the bulldog more familiarity and a closer-knit environment with a small number of walkers is the best system for him to acclimate to life on the Hilltop. Everyone understands this, and I’ve received no negativity feedback from the crew.”
Members of Jack Crew who were cut did not respond to request for comment.
The decision to reduce the size of Jack Crew stemmed from bulldog breeder Janice Hochstetler’srequest for fewer people to be responsible for the new Jack’s care. Hochstetler will spend several days on campus starting tomorrow, to see how the new bulldog acclimates to crowds and students taking pictures with him.
The mascot will be at the men’s home soccer game against DePaul University on Wednesday in order to gauge how comfortable he is in front of large crowds. Hochstetler will also walk the bulldog around Copley Lawn and O’Donovan Hall during highly trafficked times to see how he interacts with students.
He is arriving this week because if he were kept in California, where he was born, much longer, there could have been trouble transporting him to Georgetown.
“The bulldog only had a short window of time to get to D.C., because bulldogs aren’t permitted to fly in cargo, and the dog is growing too big for the cabin, so we assessed that this was the best time to bring the bulldog to campus,” O’Neill said on Friday.
Applications for mascot caretaker opened on Friday, and the Bulldog Advisory Committee, a 14-member body comprised of faculty, students, alumni and staff, is expected to make a decision this week. Fr. Christopher Steck, S.J., who cared for former mascot-in-training Jack Jr. along with Jack in New South, declined to take care of the new dog after the university denied his request for assistance from a student should he take on the responsibility.
The responsibilities of the caretaker will include providing daily care for the dog, managing the dog’s schedule of public appearances and training the downsized Jack Crew to assist the bulldog.
“There are many people in our community that are passionate about Georgetown’s bulldog tradition, so I’m sure that we’ll have a long list of good applicants for the caretaker position,” O’Neill said.

Classes that are more than three credits usually involve extra course hours or lab sessions. But for some students, a fourth credit signifies an engagement with social justice rather than more time in the classroom.
Through the Center for Social Justice’s fourth-credit option program, approximately 20 students expand on course material by volunteering for related community-based organizations.
“The goal is to help them understand their material more deeply and reflect based on community experience,” Executive Director of the CSJ Andria Wisler said.
The broad nature of social justice work gives students the flexibility to apply the fourth credit to a range of classes across departments.
Community-based organizations include government agencies, nonprofits, non-governmental organizations or schools. Students can do work ranging from service to policy analysis, research or advocacy work. All students who wish to participate can apply to the program; it is possible to receive a CSJ fourth credit for a class even if the professor does not participate.
“There’s no list of classes that accept the fourth credit,” Wisler said. “Rather, it’s that the course material deepens the student’s community engagement work and vice versa.”
James Gadea (SFS ’16), who is receiving his fourth credit in his “International Trade” class, works with the Kalmanovitz Initiative Day Laborer Exchange Program.
“You gain a deeper insight into the system and gain a more personal touch to your studies,” Gadea said. “You’re actually talking to someone that’s affected by international trade, rather than reading about the effects of international trade in a textbook or doing Aplia problems.”
For many, the work is more fulfilling than simply receiving a grade in a course.
“We’ve had kids who we now see in college or graduating high school. It’s really nice to keep up with someone and see that they’re doing well when all odds are against them,” Chloe Forman (COL ’14) said of her fourth-credit experience in the After School Kids program in conjunction with a sociology class.
Drawing the link between class and service can prove more difficult in some partnerships than others.
“I think some of the other people that were doing the fourth-credit option had classes that were more relatable because they were more directly sociology or social justice classes, and mine was a bit more of a struggle to find the link,” Forman said.
Participant Gilda Gallardo (COL ’17) is working with the D.C. Schools program as part of her linguistics class. Her own experience as an immigrant motivated her to volunteer at local schools.
“When I immigrated to the U.S., I moved into a Latino ghetto in the heart of Orange County, [Calif.], and in my neighborhood, it was hard to come by people that spoke English, so it was an academic struggle for me,” Gallardo said. “There was actually a group of college students from neighboring universities to come tutor us.”
In addition to 40 hours of volunteer work over the course of the semester, participants are expected to engage in three dialogue sessions.
“The dialogue sessions give students the ability to interact with other fourth-credit students, so they can get an even broader and deeper understanding of issues affecting our D.C. community,” Wisler said.
Students are also expected to submit three reflection pieces on their experiences.
“I think it’s important to reflect,” Gallardo said. “It’s practice for the real world when I actually do this, and spiritually, I think it’s fulfilling.”
Participants also believe the program has the potential to engage a larger cross section of the student body in community service.
“I’d like to see it as a catalyst for bringing about a deeper involvement in community service and community interaction,” Gadea said.

Georgetown’s 10-year partnership with Capital One and PNC Bank could come to an end this year.
The partnership, which began as a five-year contract in 2003, was renewed without competition for an additional five years through 2013. This year, the university sent “requests for intent” to vendors other than Capital One, though the bank is still in the running for a continued contract.
There is currently a Capital One branch in Leavey Center, and GOCards can be linked to PNC accounts to function as debit cards.
“We’re looking a little more broadly at what we want,” Associate Vice President for Financial Operations Lennie Carter said.
Qualities that the university is looking for in potential partners include wealth management, reduced fees and increased training and availability, as well as working with students to complete portfolios, manage budgets, establish and maintain credit scores and manage credit cards and credit-card debt.
A review committee composed of financial officers, students and faculty will evaluate a final list of banks to determine which partnership would best serve the university and the student population. The committee intends to make a decision by April 1, 2014, after which the campus community will be notified of any changes to campus banking.
“With our relationships, we wanted to be as transparent as possible, and we want to make sure that we include as many people as possible,” Carter said. “We want to make sure that we’re serving the community, that we’re providing the service and that there is student representation, as well as faculty and staff.”
This announcement to re-evaluate the relationship between Capital One and Georgetown comes soon after congressional scrutiny of the nationwide trend of relationships between banks and universities. In September, seven Democratic members of Congress addressed nine major financial institutions, requesting details about their partnerships with universities. Although Capital One was not among these institutions, PNC was. One of the letter’s primary causes of concern was linking of debit accounts to college IDs, which PNC does at Georgetown with GOCards.
In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau held a forum in early October, during which students testified how they had felt pressured or obligated to sign up for certain bank-offered products without being made aware of other options.
Overall, federal regulators are wary of the marketing arrangements between banks and colleges and referenced recent reports that, through those recruiting techniques, students are saddled with extraneous fees.
“Many see students as nothing more than dollar signs in backpacks,” CFPB Assistant Director and Student Loan Ombudsman Rohit Chopra told ABC News. “Too often, these deals aren’t what’s in the best interest of students.”
Several experts have suggested alternatives, such as implementing a code of conduct for bank-college partnerships, which would generally restrict the ability of lenders to co-brand with universities. Others have suggested banning all agreements between financial institutions and colleges and instead make direct deposit the first suggested option for students.
Some students have encountered this sort of pressure to open accounts with university-sanctioned banks.
“On some level, I feel as though we’re inferior in knowing about banks, and they have the power and control to make us sign documents that we’re not really sure about, but as students, we just see it as a line, and we should just sign it because that’s what we’ve always been told to do,” Tanner Davis (SFS ’17) said.
Congress’s request for information also addressed overwhelming publicity for such campus-partnered financial institutions, which often gives students the feeling that there are no other options.
“I already had Capital One, but I definitely did feel pressure from, not necessarily Georgetown but the advertising that was at Georgetown because the people in Leavey were really encouraging it,” Davis said of advertising at Georgetown. “It just seemed like they were harassing people. It was a little much.”
Nevertheless, some students said they appreciated the guidance.
“Especially for international students or students who haven’t had a credit card, we don’t really know what’s the best bank to go with, so it would be nice to get advice from the university,” Leah Metoudi (COL ’17) said.
Georgetown Capital One Branch Manager April Seymour declined repeated requests for comment.

National Resource Centers that focus on area studies, like Georgetown’s Center for Contemporary Arab Studies and Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies, have faced a series of federal budget cuts that seems likely to continue.
Funded by federal grants through Title VI of the Higher Education Act of 1965 evaluated on a four-year basis, National Resource Centers are centers at private and public universities that offer graduate degrees and language instruction focused on specific regions of the world.
Title VI provides funds for foreign language and area studies scholarships, adjunct professors with region-specific knowledge, region-focused events and community outreach.
In the last cycle, which began in 2010, these centers saw a 49 percent cut in funding, a drop from $34 million to $18 million. In comparison, the Department of Education’s discretionary budget, which also includes funding for these centers, totals more than $68 billion. Last spring’s sequester, or automatic federal budget cuts, caused another 5 percent cut.
A Council of National Resource Center Directors survey recently reported that 28 percent of polled institutions had to cancel language classes, with 84 percent of these institutions unable to find a way to attain additional sources to make up for the lost funds.
At Georgetown, three of the university’s six area studies centers are Title VI National Resource Centers: CCAS, CERES and the East Asia National Resource Center. The East Asia National Resource Center was in the development process around the time of the 2010 cuts, and its offerings were altered accordingly.
Across CCAS and CERES, 10 courses were defunded entirely; an additional two courses had their funding coverage severely slashed. Seven paid positions became unfunded, 10 positions had their funding coverage reduced and three positions were completely eliminated because the loss in funding could not be reimbursed elsewhere. Travel funding, often used for invited speakers, was slashed by 95 percent. Funding for acquiring books, publications and money for paying speakers’ fees faced similar cuts.
The next round of Title VI grant applications will be released later this year. Those funds are also subject to possible further cuts.
CERES Director Angela Stent noted that the current political climate is increasing the likelihood of these cuts.
“The real problem is that there has been this coalition between Republicans in the House, who haven’t necessarily wanted to support international education, and then people in the [Department of Education], who feel the money should go to less well-served populations,” Stent said.
Furthermore, in the area of international affairs research, the methodology of area studies has received less attention and focus in recent years. According to BMW Center for German and European Studies Director Jeffrey Anderson, the study of international affairs is becoming increasingly global in nature, rather than focusing on specific regions.
“Area studies is at risk of being neglected, because at the moment, political science is getting more quantitative, focused on more global issues and there is a strong tendency to not pay attention to countries and regions of the world,” Anderson said.
The cuts, coupled with this intellectual shift, have diminished most schools’ focus on area studies. Nevertheless, Georgetown’s dedication to the regional component of international affairs remains strong, despite the cuts in funding.
According to Anderson, graduate-level area studies programs have had steady application numbers and consistently enroll approximately 40 students each year.
In addition, Georgetown relies on additional sources of funds, such as private donors like Saudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, whose donation formed the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding or organizations like the Rockefeller Foundation and BMW.
“We are almost unique in this area. Regional studies have always had a strong presence here at the School of Foreign Service, and that, coupled with language instruction, which we excel at, sets us apart from a lot of places,” Anderson said. “We are convinced that this is not the only way to deliver international affairs education, but a good way to do it.”
Moreover, while American scholars are turning away from a region-centric approach to international affairs, demand for regional studies in the international community is growing. An International Studies Quarterly study, “What Do Policymakers Want From Us?” to be published in December 2014, surveyed top officials from the Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department and the Department of Defense to determine which social science disciplines they found to be most useful for international affairs research. Area studies topped the charts, with 70 percent of respondents rating the subject as very useful.
Stent agreed with the results of the study, referencing her years of experience in government work.
“When you work in the government, you need people who know practical things, not number crunching,” Stent said. “For that, you need deep area knowledge.”
As a result, some faculty members are optimistic about the future of the discipline.
“I suspect Georgetown is in a position to lead to a renaissance in area studies,” Center for Latin American Studies Director Marc Chernick said. “I think many universities are revisiting the ideas of having regional specialists.”
Georgetown is considering holding a conference during the 2014-2015 academic year to promote the importance of area studies.

In his short time at the Georgetown University Law Center, Mark Edward Waugh (LAW ’16) left behind a legacy of eloquence, dedication and leadership.
Waugh attended Langley High School in nearby McLean,Va., where he befriended classmate Rahul Gupta. Gupta, who received a master’s in physiology at Georgetown in 2013, was charged on Oct. 13 with stabbing Waugh to death after the two had celebrated Gupta’s 24th birthday.
Born June 26, 1990, in Washington, D.C., Waugh was an Eagle Scout who earned the Boy Scouts of America Medal of Honor in 2007 for performing the Heimlich maneuver to save the life of a fellow student choking on a bottle cap. He graduated in 2008 from Langley High School, where he was as a member of the German Honor Society, the Leadership Honor Society, the debate team and Model United Nations. Known for being rambunctious and energetic, Waugh was also a member of the football and wrestling teams.
It was in high school when he befriended Gupta, now 24 and a first-year biomedical engineering graduate student at The George Washington University. Gupta told police that he walked in on his girlfriend cheating with Waugh. The three had been up celebrating in Gupta’s Silver Spring, Md., apartment.
Nancy Waugh, Mark’s mother, told The Gazette, a Maryland community newspaper, that Gupta and Waugh had been best friends since high school.
Waugh attended James Madison University in Virginia, where he quickly found his niche as one of the top members of the school’s debate team, winning the novice tournament with his debate partner as a freshman as well as five other tournaments throughout his college career.
Waugh graduated from JMU with the highest number of debate wins in the team’s history. He was also named a National Debate Scholar and a member of the Cross Examination Debate Association All-American Team, which is composed of the top 30 university-level debaters in the country. On the College Policy Debate Forum, an online discussion board for university-level debaters, several topics have been dedicated to commemorating Waugh’s legacy and memories.
JMU professor Michael Davis, Waugh’s debate coach, attributed the team’s success to Waugh’s commitment and leadership. According to Davis, the team was never ranked higher than it was during Waugh’s tenure, when it was fifth in the country in the National Debate Tournament rankings and second in the American Debate Association rankings.
Davis and former teammates spoke of Waugh’s passion for debate, as well as his commitment to the team. Specifically, they recalled his dedication to advising younger teammates.
“Mark had this uncanny ability to be both completely and totally committed to his goals while at the same time maintaining a healthy perspective that treated each debate as a learning experience,” Davis wrote in an email. “Mark took that same attitude toward everything he experienced in life.”
Georgetown University Law Center professor Nina Pillard, who taught Waugh this semester in her civil procedure class, said that Waugh’s debate skills were noticeable and helped him to stand out in a class of 100 students.
“It showed in how clearly he expressed himself,” Pillard wrote in an email. “He asked the kind of questions that showed a curious mind and a good grasp of the issues.”
Outside of school, Waugh was known for his selflessness and his ability to reach out to others. Friends recalled his ability to relate to others and to make them feel welcome.
“Everyone was Mark’s friend. I am amazed by the number of people who have described Mark as their best friend since his passing,” Davis wrote. “Mark was one of my best friends. … Every time you walked in the room, he had [a smile] for you, and if you did not return it, he would work at it relentlessly until you smiled.”
Davis recalled stories from fellow faculty members or other teammates about Waugh’s acts of kindness, which ranged from getting friends surprise birthday cakes to standing up for a professor who was unjustly treated by her department. Overall, Davis remembered Waugh’s infectious energy.
“Mark was never afraid to hug. His hugs were the kind that let you know he loved you and valued you as a friend,” Davis said at the service. “The great part about his hugs is that he rarely let you come or go without one. If there is one way that we are to honor Mark, I think that it is to give hugs freely.”
Waugh graduated magna cum laude from JMU in May 2012 with a bachelor’s degree in history and as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He taught debate in South Korea for a year prior to enrolling in law school.
Professors said that Waugh was insightful and dedicated to his work. As a first-year law student, he was interested in international law and public policy and often participated extensively in classroom discussions.
“He would have loved being a lawyer,” Law Center professor Diana Donahoe wrote in an email. “I wish we all had more time with him at Georgetown to get to know him better.”
Waugh is survived by parents William and Nancy Waugh, brothers Matthew, James and John, grandmother Elizabeth Merrifield, as well as many extended relatives.
Donations are being made in Mark’s name to the Boy Scouts of America, and Davis is also organizing the Mark Waugh Memorial Fund, which will support Waugh’s beloved James Madison debate program.
“This loss strikes us especially hard because we are not just a bunch of people interested in the same extracurricular activity,” Davis wrote. “We are a family that celebrates each other’s successes like they are our own and suffers in each other’s losses in the same way. Losing a core member of our family is indescribably heartbreaking and a loss that I doubt we will ever get over.”
The JMU debate team is currently selling wristbands in the school’s purple and gold colors that read “Rest in Peace.” All proceeds will go toward the Mark Waugh Memorial Fund.
Waugh’s memorial service was held Sunday in Great Falls, Va.

The nation’s higher education system is exacerbating the disadvantages minorities face instead of alleviating them, a recent study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce found.
The July report, titled “Separate and Unequal: How Higher Education Reinforces the Intergenerational Reproduction of White Racial Privilege,” analyzed the correlation between the race of a student and his or her choices regarding higher education. The researchers found that white students tend to attend selective universities with high graduation rates, while minorities tend to attend open-access colleges, community colleges and other institutions with low graduation rates.
According to CEW Director of Research Jeff Strohl, a co-author of the report, this goes against the typical portrayal of college as “merit-based” and a method of leveling the playing field.
“We were greatly surprised at how significantly different the enrollment flows are between whites and minorities,” Strohl said.
Strohl reported that 82 percent of white enrollment is in the top 468 schools, while African-American and Hispanic students make up 92 percent of enrollment in lower-tier schools.
“There has been a great shift in white enrollment out of the bottom tiers of the education system up to the top, while 72 percent of African-American and 68 percent of net new Hispanic enrollment has gone to the bottom,” Strohl said.
Resident Director of the Black House Aya Waller-Bey (COL ’14) attributed this to a lack of access.
“College-bound students from high-need communities often lack the exposure to institutions like Georgetown, as many of their peers choose not to attend college or attend public, in-state institutions — or their schools may not encourage their students to apply to selective colleges and universities,” Waller-Bey said.
As a result, Dean of Admissions Charles Deacon said that Georgetown has partnered with Knowledge Is Power Program charter schools nationwide and Cristo Rey Jesuit high schools to reach potential applicants who would otherwise view Georgetown as inaccessible. The Georgetown Scholarship Program, which supports approximately 10 percent of the student body, also helps students from underperforming schools navigate the academic environment of Georgetown to promote a higher graduation rate.
“Kids from these schools would graduate nationally at 32 percent, but at Georgetown, they graduate at 95 percent,” Deacon said.
Overall, however, Deacon said that Georgetown tended to fit in with the report’s findings.
“Low-income students, particularly minority students, don’t have access to places like Georgetown,” Deacon said. “For a place like Georgetown, there’s only so much you can do since we are an academic institution, and we need a pool of talented students. The process is watching out through all of the eyes of the people who read applications for interesting, talented people — recognizing that the current odds are tilted against some people.”
The New York Times conducted a study in May that addressed the relationship between black freshman matriculation and overall graduation rates in specific universities. In the study, Georgetown had a 93.8 percent graduation rate and 8.2 percent of the class was African-American. In comparison, Columbia University had a 92.8 percent graduation rate with 10.5 percent of the class African-American. Duke University had a 94.4 percent graduation rate with 11.8 percent black students.
Nevertheless, Deacon said that Georgetown is diverse.
“There are a lot of pretty well-known schools with pretty low percentages of African American and Latino students,” Deacon said. “Georgetown is actually doing well, relatively speaking. We still could do even better, is the point.”
Strohl agreed and pointed to admissions results from the top selective schools in the country, although he would not comment specifically on Georgetown’s results.
“What we have seen is that the most selective schools haven’t cast their net wide enough and are missing a significant number of high-performing, low-income, minority students,” Strohl said.
Waller-Bey agreed and said that she felt Georgetown could do more to reach out to underrepresented communities.
“I think Georgetown could work more diligently to increase its presence in underrepresented communities in urban cities, which as a result could increase the amount of minority students who apply and gain admissions to Georgetown,” Waller-Bey said.
But the issue of reaching out to underrepresented communities has become more complicated in recent years as class is often seen as a better judge of privilege than race.
“In today’s world, there are many students of multiple races, and as time is going on, the blending and blurring of race is becoming more of a complicating factor, which is why we look at class more than race,” Deacon said. “If we are successful at looking at class, we’re going to include everyone because first-generation, working-class, white kids can get passed up by affirmative action programs based only on race.”

Students will offer solutions for federal agencies this Thursday as part of “The Battle of the Beltway,” a government business case competition sponsored by Deloitte.
Competitors will present a week’s worth of research to a panel of judges with the hope of maintaining Georgetown’s top rank from last year.
The competition consists of two rounds; in a preliminary intra-school round, nine Georgetown teams will compete for two slots in the second leg. Georgetown’s winning representatives will then compete against the top two teams from seven other East Coast universities: American University, The George Washington University, Howard University, Princeton University, the University of Richmond, Wake Forest University and the College of William and Mary.
The participants, limited to sophomores and juniors, receive a fake case based on one of Deloitte’s real cases and are given a week to put together a 25-minute presentation proposing a unique solution. The competition forces students to use both analytical and creative thinking when solving problems for different industries.
“It’s a really interesting way to think outside the box, and to be introduced to consulting, or even just problem-solving,” Alyxie Harrick (SFS ’12), federal analyst for Deloitte and co-lead for the Georgetown program of the competition, said.
Last year, a Georgetown team took first prize. Team members Christina Ling (MSB ’15), Brandon Lam (SFS ’14) and Joseph Albanese (SFS ’14) met for several hours a day during the week preceding their presentation.
“It’s very team-driven,” Ling, who will compete again this year, said. “I knew them, but I wasn’t good friends with them, and it definitely pushed us a lot closer together.”
Along with the hours spent strategizing together, Ling also chose to skip one of her midterms to participate in the competition.
“It was a rare opportunity that I wouldn’t get on campus because I go to lecture every day, I take tests every day,” Ling said. “That doesn’t really assess how good you are. It doesn’t showcase if you’re making an impact in life.”
Last year, the group spent the week researching the Drug Enforcement Agency for the first round and healthcare in East Africa for the second round.
“[These are] radically different things, yet these are both things that are handled within the same company by the same people doing it,” Albanese said.
For many students, the competition serves as their first real exposure to consulting.
“I didn’t know what consulting was when I started sophomore year,” Lam said.
Now, Lam has signed a contract with consulting firm PGA.
The competition also gives students interested in consulting as a career the opportunity to network and practice their consulting skills. Like Albanese and Lam, Alexander Keyes (MSB ’15) also hopes to become a consultant after college, and sees the competition as a way to learn more about the practice.
“I’m most looking forward to practicing, or developing the skills that consultants use on their jobs,” Keyes said.
Ling noted that there has been a recent increase in interest toward consulting among upperclassmen at Georgetown.
“For some reason, there’s been some surge of people. When you get to junior year, everyone says — if you ask any junior — I’m interested in consulting,” Ling said. “It’s like a trend. It’s like how Sperry’s are to Georgetown, or like Vineyard Vines and J. Crew [are]; consulting is the job you want to get.”

After an overhaul of the student club approval process over the past year, a Council Advisory Board including representatives from five different advisory boards will now have the final say whether proposed clubs make the cut.
Under the old system, a Center for Student Engagement administrator would review one of the 40 to 60 new club proposals submitted each semester and then direct the proposal toward one of five appropriate advisory boards: the Media Board, Performing Arts Advisory Council, Student Activities Commission, club sports and the Center for Social Justice Advisory Board. That group would then decide whether to approve an organization and help it start out on campus.
“There were a lot of problems with the system. It wasn’t necessarily conducive to good group-forming,” Chair of the Student Activities Commission Jennifer Chiang (SFS ’15) said. “We were given assignments and told, ‘Here’s your group.’”
Additionally, the new system curbs waiting time for groups that do not meet an advisory board’s requirements on their first try.
“In the past, if a group was applying just to an advisory board specifically, that board might review their application and determine, ‘Well, they don’t really meet our criteria for the type of groups we take right now,’” Director of Student Engagement Erika Cohen Derr said. “In the old process, that group would just have to wait until the next development round and then try to reapply to a different advisory board then. We wanted to minimize that experience.”
The new process is also intended to decrease confusion about groups that do not fit neatly under one advisory board.
“Sometimes there are groups that are proposed where it’s not necessarily clear whether, say, they belong to the CSE or the CSJ, and so the advisory board members are the ones that are in the best position to make determinations about which board they’re assigned to,” Cohen Derr said.
While the CAB will increase advisory board collaboration, Cohen Derr said that the specialized advisory boards will remain autonomous.
“They are seeking to strike a balance between the collaboration process that all boards are brought into and honoring the unique characteristics of each board and the fact that each board supports their members in a unique set of realities,” Cohen Derr said.
If a student advisory board does not want to accept a new group under its authority, however, a majority of the advisory boards in the CAB can force them to accept the group anyway.
The new student organization development process allows the CAB to collectively make decisions regarding the benefits given to fledgling clubs, including university-wide recognition, funding, campus resources and use of the Georgetown name.
Alex Skarzynski (SFS ’15), chair of the club sports advisory board, praised the ability of the new club development structure to allow student participation in what had previously been an administration-dominated process.
“Before, the only conversation among boards would really be administrator to administrator. … I would usually never know the chair of SAC, just because there’s not that much that we overlapped,”Skarzynski said. “CAB has been a great way for student leaders of these groups to be the voice, as opposed to just administrators.”
Chiang agreed and said that the enhanced cooperation among different advisory boards was the primary benefit of the changes.
“It’s very helpful to have somebody else at the table to talk it out with,” Chiang said. “It made us more of a cohesive board and made things more consistent.”
While still a new process, the changes have already proven conducive to bringing new clubs into the existing fold, including Hoya Sana, a yoga and stress-release club, and Brilliantly British, a British culture appreciation society
“I’m really happy to say that in the past cycle, each advisory board was able to take at least one new group into the new club development process,” Chiang said.
“It unifies us and presents the united front that you’d want from advisory boards that represent so many groups on campus,” Skarzynski added.

Women business executives and students who hope to one day be in their shoes will gather in the McDonough School of Business on Friday for a new conference aiming to teach women how to succeed in the business world.
The Undergraduate Women in Business Conference is the first of its kind for the MSB. Only a few other universities, including Harvard University and New York University, have held conferences that focus on women in business.
The main goal of the event, according to conference co-chair and MSB Assistant Dean Nicole Houle, is to empower students and faculty, as well as help them network.
“We really wanted this to be an opportunity for our women business students to find a platform in which they can really connect with their peers and other women to find mentors in the field and in industries and … to find out how to become leaders,” Houle said.
To that end, the conference will feature keynote addresses from successful businesswomen, including former U.S. Ambassador at-Large for Global Women’s Issues Melanne Verveer — who is now executive director of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security — Potomac Research Group CEO Suzanne Clark and Deloitte Vice President Cathy Benko. The event will also have an interactive component with opportunities for students to network with the speakers and conference attendees, as well as to attend leadership panels with women executives.
Vice President for Institutional Diversity and Equity Rosemary Kilkenny will deliver an address on women’s leadership in higher education.
“I would like to give people a lay of the land on what the actual representation is of women in higher education in the United States at American colleges and universities, what challenges women face as they navigate those types of positions … and how women can actually position themselves to be successful in positions of that kind,” Kilkenny said.
Planned over the past year by assistant MSB deans and co-chairs Houle and Monija Amani, the conference was a collaborative effort by a committee of faculty and students.
“[Students] really gave us ideas of what they wanted out of the conference, and we took their ideas and hope to materialize them,” Amani said.
Planning committee members Ashley Murdock (MSB ’14), Dana Mitchell (MSB ’15) and Viviana Jaramillo (MSB ’15) worked to make the conference student centered. Murdock attended the Harvard University Women in Business Conference recently to get a sense of how similar conferences function.
“Going to the Harvard Women in Business Conference two weeks ago and being surrounded by thousands of women who are like minded, driven and want to do well within society was just really great,” Murdock said.
MSB Senior Associate Dean and Director of Undergraduate Programs Norean Sharpe said she hopes that the conference will impact attendees.
“I would like to empower women,” Sharpe said. “I would like women to leave the conference feeling confident, feeling motivated and feeling that they can compete in today’s global economy.”
With more than 300 attendees already registered, the conference has attracted the interest of faculty and students from other universities across the country.
“It is hard for women these days, especially within the business world,” Murdock said. “[You can] learn from people in industries that you want to go into. Whether it’s someone who’s the CEO or vice president or high-up executive, you’re able to understand what their journey is and how you can get there.”

Mayor Vincent Gray’s legislative push for sustainability, proposed to the District of Columbia Council on Oct. 1, would ban all Styrofoam food containers in the District beginning in January 2018.
The Sustainable D.C. Legislative Package of 2013, composed of eight bills, would require seven votes of 13 to pass. A date for the vote has not yet been set, and the other bills serve to encourage public transit and alternative fuels and energy sources, to amend the District’s tree-replacement program and to create a youth environmental literacy program, among other things.
The Anacostia Pollution Prevention Act of 2013 seeks to ban all food containers, plates, hot and cold beverage cups, meat and vegetable trays and egg cartons made of expanded polystyrene, or Styrofoam and would be applicable to all businesses that sell or provide food for consumption. It also encourages the use of compostable or recyclable containers.
Environmental rights activists argue that, while polystyrene is generally inexpensive and more insulating than paper, it is difficult to recycle, minimally biodegradable and often ends up in waterways. According to Anacostia Watershed Society President James Foster, the Anacostia River is currently not safe for swimming or fishing due to the high amount of waste and pollution affecting its waters. Currently, Styrofoam accounts for 30 percent of trash caught in the river, and beverage containers make up 40 percent.
Gray is seeking to reduce the amount of waste in the river, which is measured through a trash trap set up on one of the river’s tributaries.
“We’ll see a debate, we’ll see a discussion, and you know, the plastic bag manufacturers and the Styrofoam container manufacturers will push back because, you know, it’s their livelihood,” Foster said. “I hate that we have to take this route, but people aren’t taking personal responsibility for the disposal of some of these materials, and they’re ending up in my river, the Anacostia.”
If the D.C. Council were to pass the legislation, the District would join Seattle and several California and East Coast cities, including Brookline, Mass., and San Jose, Calif., in enforcing such a policy.
Philadelphia, New York, Chicago and Boston, among others, are also currently discussing similar measures.
The legislation would, however, affect several local businesses, including Mai Thai, which would need to reevaluate its packaging.
According to Mai Thai Manager Lloyd Angus, the restaurant’s four highest-selling dishes, which include pad thai, drunken noodle and several appetizers, use Styrofoam packaging. Other forms of possible packaging materials include plastic, banana leaves and foil.
“Plastic packaging is a little more expensive, so we would have to budget in for that,” Angus said.
According to an American Chemistry Council report conducted for New York’s proposed ban, for every $1 currently spent on Styrofoam containers, businesses would have to spend at least $1.94 on alternatives.
In a document prepared for the D.C. Council, D.C. Chief Financial Officer Natwar Gandhi presented similar findings, particularly concerning the financial impact on the D.C. public school system, the Department of Corrections, the public charter school system and the Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services. According to Gandhi, banning Styrofoam could drive up the cost of the public school system food service contract by $400,000, and other contracts would be similarly affected.
Nevertheless, Gandhi stressed that the economic effect could be easily absorbed by the D.C. Department of Environment’s existing resources.
The bill will not, however, highly impact university operations, which does not currently utilize Styrofoam in Grab ‘n’ Go or Epicurean and Co.
“From an environmental standpoint, we are already out ahead on this topic,” Office of Sustainability Program Coordinator for Sustainability Audrey Stewart said.
