O’Donovan Hall workers and the Georgetown Solidarity Committee are collaborating to promote Real Food Real Jobs, a campaign that advocates for improved food quality and food service workers’ rights.
The two groups organized a town hall forum Monday evening to discuss the campaign, which is part of a nationwide initiative began by UNITE-HERE, the labor union that represents Leo’s workers.
The Real Food Real Jobs campaign started in Washington, D.C., last summer when contracts with food providers expired at many local universities, according to GSC member Erin Riordan (COL ’15).
Riordan and several other GSC members heard about the campaign through Local 23, the D.C. branch of the union, at the same time as Leo’s workers began to reach out to GSC members with concerns about the quality of the food they were preparing.
“We all noticed the changes happening at Leo’s this year. Some of the workers reached out to us. They were concerned with the food quality and what they were being asked to serve students — they care that students were upset,” Riordan said. “We recognized that bringing Real Food Real Jobs to Georgetown was something that we definitely needed to do. Workers are absolutely students’ strongest advocates in terms of food quality.”
The campaign aims to give workers a voice in the food-preparation process and facilitate increased training and skill development. Unlike workplace conditions, food quality does not currently fall under protected speech in the workers’ contract, so workers could potentially lose their jobs for speaking about the food which they are preparing.
The town hall meeting gave organizers the opportunity to present the campaign to both Aramarkadministrators and students.
Tarshea Smith, an employee who has worked at Leo’s for 19 years but is currently on leave working with UNITE-HERE, said that the campaign has successfully given a voice to workers’ concerns.
“We already had these same things we wanted — increased hours, worker training, et cetera — and now we’ve put on a name on it,” Smith said.
She said she believes that one of the main issues is a lack of general training about the content of Leo’s dishes for workers.
“They may ask us to work at a [food] station, and you don’t know anything about the food, and you’re scared to say you don’t know what to do,” she said.
The campaign also addresses other concerns, such as ensuring that workers are able to work a full 40-hour work week and that lower-level chefs are able to obtain food-handling licenses.
GSC has identified additional goals for the campaign, which include advocating for the use of local agriculture in Leo’s and paying workers a living wage.
According to GSC member Caleb Weaver (SFS ’16), UNITE-HERE has supported Georgetown students’ efforts to bring Real Food Real Jobs to campus.
“They’re really excited. What they’ve emphasized is that campaigns like this aren’t really effective if they’re an outside party. We emphasize that we this is something we want to come from the Georgetown community with the support of the union, not [something] imposed on us from outside,” Weaver said.
Allison Burket, an organizer with UNITE-HERE, attended the town hall meeting.
“I’m so excited students and workers are standing together to fight for sustainable food and jobs. Georgetown is really taking an initiative in taking part in the campaign especially because [unlike other D.C.-area schools], workers contracts are not currently up for renegotiation,” Burket said.
In an effort to make the initiative a community-wide effort, GSC has reached out to several other student groups on campus to get involved in the campaign. Georgetown University College Democrats and Georgetown Occupy, in particular, have both expressed interest in the campaign.
GSC members were hopeful that this campaign would mobilize the Georgetown community.
“A lot of people are going to be hooked when they hear about how this [campaign] affects food quality. I think that establishing the connection between quality of food and worker justice issues is going to allow the community … to see how bringing about better food quality for the community can lead to a more just workplace and a more firm commitment to our Jesuit values,” Weaver said. “The principles of social justice as part of Georgetown’s Jesuit identity demand that employees of Georgetown are treated in a just manner.”

David Edgar (SFS ’15), Agree Ahmed (SFS ‘15) and Warren Wilson (SFS ’15) entered Georgetown in Up to Us, a year-long national competition among universities to raise awareness about the national debt crisis.
The contest is sponsored by the Clinton Global Initiative University, a college-focused branch of the organization started by former President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68) that gives global leaders a forum to discuss challenges around the world; the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a nonpartisan organization that aims to raise economic awareness in the United States; and Net Impact, a nonprofit organization that promotes socially responsible business practices.
At the CGI U meeting held at Washington University in St. Louis in April 2013, 12 universities will be evaluated based on how well their Up to Us chapters raised awareness about the debt crisis on their respective campuses.
Each group has made a page on Facebook that will be used to measure their impact on campus. The Georgetown Up to Us page currently has 188 members and is in third place behind New York University and the University of Michigan.
The winner will receive a $10,000 prize and will be chosen based on the percentage of the student body that has supported the page, survey responses the groups have received, personal connections the groups have made with their university communities, adherence to CGI U rules, creativity, visibility, learning and the overall success of the campaign.
The Georgetown group has high hopes for their success on campus and at CGI U in the spring.
“I think we at Georgetown are unique in that we’re really organization based as a school,” said OltanAkin (MSB ’15), who joined the Up to Us group soon after the original founders. “The student body is a lot more tight-knit than at other schools. I think students here are very actively involved.”
The groups are only allowed to officially advocate for their cause from Jan. 21 to March 1, according to rules set by the national program. Next semester, the Georgetown group plans to sponsor speaking events, case and essay competitions and social gatherings. Edgar said that he hopes to have a Georgetown professor debate an outside speaker and that the group has spoken with the government department, economics department and the McDonough School of Business about this possibility.
The contest and groups are all nonpartisan, and Akin said that Up to Us Georgetown is planning to reach out to members of both the Georgetown University College Democrats and the College Republicans.
Akin also pointed to Georgetown’s location as an advantage in the competition.
“We have access to really important people in D.C. Other schools don’t have access to that resource, so we should definitely try to take advantage of that,” he said.
Wilson said that the debt crisis has continued relevance to college students.
“I think it mattered, and it matters more than we give it credit for,” he said.
He also joked about another advantage Georgetown may have at CGI U in April.
“If we can’t win with our alumnus running it, we’ve got problems,” he said.

For the first time in six years, Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E held its monthly meeting on Georgetown’s campus Monday night.
ANC 2E04 Commissioner Jake Sticka (SFS ’13), who suggested the meeting take place on campus instead of its traditional location at nearby Georgetown Visitation School, said that the change is indicative of the new partnership the university is fostering with its neighbors.
“It was my thought that a really concrete way to demonstrate that commitment to the campus community would be to have an ANC meeting on campus,” said Sticka, whose recommendation to hold the meeting on campus was supported by the other ANC commissioners.
Sticka said that one benefit of holding the meeting on campus was to give students an opportunity to learn more about how ANC and local governments function. However, he expressed disappointment at the small turnout of fewer than 10 Georgetown students at the meeting.
“It’s not the best time of year for students to come out, obviously, which is a little unfortunate,” he said.
Yet Chair Ron Lewis said the on-campus meeting is a sign of the changing times fuelled by the new compromise on the 2010 Campus Plan. Such cooperation is part of an effort to foster increased direct interaction between the university and its neighbors with the help of the Georgetown Community Partnership.
At the meeting, the commission indicated that all negotiations regarding the university’s campus plan have been finalized and that the implementation phase has begun.
“That, I would say, has gotten off to a very good start,” Lewis said. “The partnership between the ANC and the university has become collegial.”
Commissioners also confirmed that the G2 bus, which had service to the corner of 37th and O Streets suspended for over a year during the reconstruction of O and P Streets, will resume normal operations later in December and will feature a new fleet of smaller hybrid buses.
A regional vice president for Comcast attended the meeting to ensure residents that her company’s telecommunications boxes have been installed below ground. Comcast’s earlier installation on sidewalks had incited ire from some members of the community.
The commission also heard from representatives of Gypsy Sally’s Acoustic Tavern, a proposed new dining and entertainment establishment at 3401 K St. The commission had protested Gypsy Sally’s proposal, concerned that the venue would frequently extend its hours of operation late into the night, yet this protest was revoked during the meeting after Gypsy Sally representatives agreed to add language to their proposal limiting the extension of operating hours to special occasions, such as the Presidential Inauguration.
This month’s meeting was Sticka’s last as a commissioner. His fellow ANC commissioners praised the work Sticka has put in during his two year tenure.
“I want to express my appreciation for the work he has done with us and say what a pleasure it has been having him as part of our team these last two years,” said ANC 2E Vice-Chair Tom Birch.
Newly elected representatives Peter Prindiville (SFS ’14) and Craig Cassey (COL ’15) will begin their terms in January.

After university administrators raised the evidentiary standard for disciplinary proceedings from “more likely than not” to “clear and convincing” in October, the Student Advocacy Office will begin working to extend the new standard to off-campus incidents this spring.
Next semester, SAO plans to work with the offices of Student Affairs and Student Conduct to establish a working definition for “clear and convincing.” The standard will take effect Jan. 1, with all violations before then evaluated under the “more likely than not” standard. Once a definition is established, SAO senior advocate Constantine Petallides (SFS ’13) said he believes the university will be more receptive to extending the standard to off-campus incidents.
“We want to see how it unfolds,” Petallides said. “We’ll work out a compromise with the offices with ‘clear and convincing,’ see how this works for a semester or full year and then we can apply the logic of ‘clear and convincing’ to off campus. After a semester or two, hopefully the evidence makes the case strong.”
According to SAO advocate Jay Factor (COL ’14), the university is still unsure of exactly what “clear and convincing” means, and it may not align with what students expect.
“For us, ‘clear and convincing’ means there was actual evidence — there was something linking you to something, for example if you were charged with drinking alcohol, you were seen drinking alcohol,” Factor said. “For the university it may be closer to a 75 percent chance you were found responsible.”
SAO’s efforts to extend the evidentiary standard are the latest in a series of initiatives to ensure the fair treatment of students off campus.
Last semester, SAO gained a seat on the Weekend Review Council, a body composed of representatives from the Student Neighborhood Assistance Program, the Metropolitan Police Department, the Office of Student Affairs and the Office of Student Conduct. The committee reviews write-ups to gain a sense of what is happening on campus and how the Department of Public Safety responds, but does not control any disciplinary action.
“It’s nice to have a student voice there when the police or [any council members] say, ‘these damn kids today,’” Petallides said. “It immediately changes the dialog because one of us is there and they’re not going to say those things to our faces. It prevents them from bullying the university.”
However, Petallides said this exchange also works in both directions.
“[The neighbors] aren’t all the crazy guys who tried to take pictures and videos of everyone. They do understand that they live in a college town, that the university was here first, but it is also their home,” he said. “It’s nice from our perspective to have a face to put to the demon that is the neighbors and it’s nice for the saner ones who like to talk about the problem to have a face to put to the students.”
Petallides said that SAO’s main contribution to the campus community has been its founding mission: to prepare students for disciplinary hearings with the administration. This semester, the 22 advocates of SAO have handled approximately 20 cases and answered queries regarding the disciplinary system from approximately 40 students.
“We act as defense attorneys during disciplinary hearings for students,” Petallides said. “We help them, tell them what to expect, and offer any help we can. Our experience — we know the precedent — helps them form a defense.”
SAO advocates may attend disciplinary hearings as silent participants. However, in some cases,Petallides said, SAO advocates do not feel equipped to handle disciplinary preparation.
“Someone is putting their trust in you,” he said. “I went through the training but I’m also still a student who has read the code of conduct maybe two to three more times than the average student. In serious cases someone’s future could be riding on you. We’ve had cases where suspension or expulsion was on the table.”
Petallides expects SAO’s role to change slightly after “clear and convincing” takes effect in January.
“We’re going to have a lot less work. At least that’s how I hope it will go,” he said.
Nonetheless, Factor said he hopes to increase SAO’s visibility on campus next semester. For the first time this year, information about SAO was included in the packet that all new students receive when they arrive on campus, which Factor said helped to increase awareness about the resource.
“We’re working to become more institutionalized so more people know about us. When people get written up they think, ‘Oh, I got written up, what do I do now?’ We want them to think, ‘Oh, I got written up, and there’s this resource available,’” he said.

The GUSA senate unanimously passed a bill Sunday to create a pilot program for voluntary composting for residents of Alumni Square.
The program, set to debut in spring 2013, will provide a sealed composting bin to apartments that volunteer to participate. Students will then be able to empty their bins in a central compositing bin located at the trash and recycling collection site in Village B.
The pilot program is led by Georgetown University Student Association senator Vetone Ivezaj (COL ’13), chair of the GUSA Student Life Subcommittee on Sustainability. Ivezaj explained that GUSA will keep tally of participation by requiring students to record their apartment numbers when they empty their bins.
“There will be a log book next to each composting site, so students will have to sign in when the compost,” she said.
Ivezaj said the program will run for three to four weeks before GUSA evaluates whether the project will be extended to other apartments in Village A, Nevils and Henle Village.
The GUSA bill also allocates $100 to establish a raffle for all students who volunteer to compost aimed at providing an incentive for participation.
Ivezaj said a similar program was started by the Magis Row Meditation Houses last year, which inspired her to start the GUSA composting program. The compostable waste is collected by one of the Meditation houses and transported to Kehoe Field to be used for the Georgetown Garden.
“Due to the success the townhouses have found, I believe composting will yield promising results in the apartments as well,” she said.
GUSA Speaker Nate Tisa (SFS’14) stressed that the simplicity and convenience of the program has the potential to promote sustainability.
“These things are so common sense,” Tisa said. “It really helps the environment. It saves some money for the university also because they don’t have to pay another truck to carry to the landfill. I’m very excited about what this can do.”
Dan Mathis (SFS ’13), executive board member of Georgetown Energy, said he was happy to see student leaders take an initiative in this area.
“Green improvements on campus and in student life are always a step in the right direction for Georgetown,” Mathis said.

Several employees in O’Donovan Hall allege that they have not been paid what they were promised for completing special projects.
Jeff Day, who has worked in Leo’s for almost five years,said that he has not been properly compensated for painting part of the dining hall over the summer. Day initially requested $16 per hour for the painting project, but his employers paid him just 50 cents extra over his hourly wage of $11.85, promising him retroactive pay that he has not yet received.
“It was just me and one other employee, and we painted the upper and lower walls of the dining hall,” Day said. “We worked all through the summer until the students arrived, and we were promised higher pay for doing an engineering job. My pay went up temporarily, but then it went back to normal wage, and I still haven’t received the retro pay I was promised during the summer.”
Troy Washington, a Leo’s supervisor and a representative of UNITE HERE, the union under which Leo’s workers are organized, confirmed that employees who work on these special projects are meant to receive higher wages under the terms of their contracts.
“The job you’re doing [when painting] is building-engineering,” Washington said. “Under building-engineering you’re supposed to get the same wages that building engineers get.”
Day said the other employee, who has since left his position at Georgetown, did not receive his retroactive pay either.
Charles Hendricks, a lead organizer of UNITE HERE Local 23, explained, “There’s a system in the contract [in which] employees can file grievances, which ultimately go to a neutral third party called arbitration if the employer and the union can’t reach an agreement.”
Hendricks said that assigning a task to an employee outside of his job description would violate the contract that union representatives at Leo’s negotiated with Aramark, the company that manages Georgetown’s dining services.
“I’ve never heard of an issue of the employer making people do engineering work, but that would certainly be a violation of the contract,” Hendricks said. “That’s a good thing for the employee to go to the employer about, go to the shop steward about and file a grievance about.”
Karen Cutler, director of communications for Aramark, stated in an email that she had not heard about these problems.
“We are unaware of any of these issues, but, as always, are committed to discussing any matters with our employees and their elected representatives,” she wrote. “Our employees at Georgetown are represented by a union and covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We strive to follow all terms and conditions of that agreement, which includes a clear provision for how to address and resolve employee issues and concerns.”
Yet Day said that he and other employees are reluctant to use the grievance system because they feel it could threaten their jobs.
“We’ve heard of the grievance process, but from what I’ve heard, we’ve only used it against each other. I’ve never heard of one of my coworkers filing a grievance against an employer. Basically, they’re afraid of termination,” Day said. “They might be terminated because there is some good management here and there is overbearing management, and many times we feel that if we make a complaint, we risk losing our jobs.”
Hendricks, however, said any retaliation on the part of Aramark against an employee grievance would violate the workers’ contract and is illegal.
“Employees have a right under the law and under their [contracts] to file complaints … through the union contract to enforce their rights,” he said.
Washington said that Aramark has weekly meetings with workers, but these meetings do not necessarily assuage the doubts of workers who are intimidated by the grievance system.
“We came up with this system for better communication,” she said. “We meet with them every week [to straighten] things out and [talk] about things that aren’t right.”
“Some workers go and talk to Georgetown students,” Hendricks said, “thinking that students are going to fix the problems for them rather than [going to] their coworkers and … [bringing] the issues up to management. I keep getting phone calls from students on a regular basis about issues that never get brought up to the shop stewards.
“We don’t have any way to know if [workers are] being paid correctly unless they tell us they’re not being paid correctly,” Hendricks added.
Day said that while he was painting the dining hall, Aramark managers employed a contractor outside of Leo’s to supplement the job.
“I brought many of my own tools from home to complete the job,” he said. “Then they employed an outside painter [who] was paid much higher than I was and they gave him my tools, so I was left to do my part of the job without my tools for lower pay.”
Day said he was assigned these tasks through a system in which management asks interested employees to submit their names to a special projects list. From this list, management selects Leo’s employees based on seniority. Employees typically work these jobs for standard overtime pay, even when the task is not included in their job descriptions.
Additionally, Day said that he has trained several employees without receiving a pay increase. Generally, employees referred to as “leads” are responsible for training new employees and are compensated appropriately for this work, according to Leo’s employee and UNITE HERE representative Tarshea Smith. Day said that although he is not a lead, he does the same work as most leads and was still asked to train other workers without lead pay.
“I have been put in charge [of] training many employees. I spend extra time teaching these employees how to perform certain jobs, but I have not been paid extra for training them,” he said. “Many of these employees are promoted higher than I am even though they have less experience.”
Day said he has not been compensated appropriately because he only made a verbal agreement to offer training.
“They wanted to save some money, but they didn’t pay me what they promised because they were paying me outside of contract,” he said. “They said it was a verbal agreement, but if you verbally agree to do something, then honor what you said you’re going to do.”
In response to the employee’s claim that he was not paid for training other employees, Hendricks stated that he did not know the specifics of the Leo’s workers’ contracts.
“Many union contracts call for a training wage if you are training an employee; many union contracts call for [a higher rate of pay] if you work out of your classification doing a higher-paid job,” he said.
Day said he is still confused as to why he hasn’t been granted promised retroactive pay.
“Everyone else who has worked the entire summer has already gotten paid. I should have been paid right after summer break ended. It doesn’t make sense,” he said.
