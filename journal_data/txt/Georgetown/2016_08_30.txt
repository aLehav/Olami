This year’s New Student Orientation, with its Olympics-inspired “Light Your Torch” theme, welcomed the approximately 1,600 freshmen members of the Class of 2020 and over 200 transfer students to life at Georgetown from Aug. 27 to Aug. 30.
This year’s schedule retained cornerstone NSO events, including the Marino Workshop and mandatory sexual assault awareness session “I Am Ready.”
For the first time, move in took place on one day for all new students Friday, Aug. 26 from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. This year was also the first to lack an International Student Pre-Orientation.
According to Emma Barnitt (MSB ’17), one of five NSO coordinators, the new move-in system was a success.
“It flowed really well,” Barnitt said. “I’m really happy about it and can’t wait to see how it works next year.”
This year also included the first Jesuit Values Panel, which took place Sunday night alongside Hoya Real Talk and “I Am Ready,” to introduce the new students to Campus Ministry and draw out the influences of the university’s Jesuit tradition on daily campus life.
Barnitt said these changes reflect a desire on the part of the coordinators to make the purpose of NSO more clear.
“We were hoping to make things more intentional in the programming to truly introduce our new students into Georgetown, academically, spiritually and communally,” Barnitt said. “I think we achieved that in the programming as well as in the training for our staff.”
Despite the changes, certain programs seen as fixtures of the NSO experience remained. The Marino Workshop, funded by the family of Frederick Marino (SLL ’68), aims to introduce new students to the intellectual rigor of Georgetown through a book discussion.
This year the workshop, which has been a requirement for incoming Georgetown students since 1995, focused on “The Hired Man,” a novel about the impact of war by Lannan Center Chair of Poetics Aminatta Forna.
Communications and Marketing Coordinator for Georgetown University Libraries Katherine Thomas said that, while the selection process was intense, Forna emerged eventually as the right fit.
“We try to make sure that the topic will be challenging but still engaging because we don’t want it to be a slog to read. [Forna] was particularly nice for us because she is the Lannan visiting chair of poetics this year at Georgetown,” Thomas said. “Usually, the author is a one-off experience. But this time, they get to have more face time with the author and they get to follow up on the Marino experience either in class or in a session with her.”
The Marino Workshop is one of the signature programs that also takes place at the School of Foreign Service Qatar campus in Doha during orientation, along with Pluralism in Action. These events help bring together the freshmen class as a whole, according to Thomas.
“We think Marino is a wonderful way to bring everyone together, no matter if you’re pre-med or in the SFS,” Thomas said. “You get to come in and have this shared academic experience with all your fellow students.”
Thomas said the intended outcomes of the Marino Workshop dovetail with those of NSO overall.
“It provokes a lot of interesting discussion and helps develop the mentality that students should be willing and comfortable to challenge one another,” Thomas said. “All of college is a dialogue so it’s helping you develop those tools.”
Mark Camilli (COL ’19), who is an Orientation Adviser for the first time this year, said he has found the experience to be tough but rewarding.
“My experience as an OA has been both up and down,” Camilli said. “It’s been really long days but NSO has given me a new look at Georgetown and has made me realize how much I love it here. It’s reminded me how much this place is a home to me and I really love sharing that with new students.”

This year’s Georgetown Weeks of Welcome, held from Aug. 30 to Oct. 8, will not include the annual Kickback concert as coordinators focus efforts on expanding and improving other events amid low student turnout in past years.
According to the Vice President of the Georgetown Program Board Andrew Minkovitz (SFS ’17), GPB and Students of Georgetown, Inc. both agreed not to host the concert this year. Minkovitz said it is possible the Kickback concert will be brought back in subsequent years.
“GPB made the decision together with The Corp not to host Kickback this year as we both wanted to focus our efforts on other events this fall,” Minkovitz wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We expect in the near future to look into the possibility of bringing back the festival next fall.”
GWOW Coordinator Emily Ma (SFS ’19) said the organizations responsible for hosting the Kickback concert last year collectively decided to cancel this year’s concert due to low student participation and the large effort required to host it.
“I think just as a whole GPB, GWOW and The Corp just decided not to host kickback,” Ma said. “Kickback was probably just harder to get off the ground because it was only around for a few years, and it is difficult to kind of guarantee success or a huge turnout.”
Ma said last year’s Kickback concert was not very successful due to rainy weather that lowered turnout.
“I know last year there were complications with the weather and the turnout and how that was impacted because of the rain,” Ma said.
The Corp confirmed in an email to The Hoya that it would not be hosting Kickback this year.
Ma said there would be no musical replacement for the Kickback concert, but instead the Big Hunt program — a city-wide scavenger hunt that takes a day and allows students to win prizes and explore more of the city outside Georgetown — would be expanded.
GPB President Nick Bailey (MSB ’17), who also works for The Hoya, said the six weeks of GWOW are a collaboration between several campus student organizations to allow all students to enjoy events on campus and socialize with each other.
“Georgetown Program Board partners with [New Student Orientation] and Georgetown Weeks of Welcome to provide fun and low-cost entertainment to all students during the first few weeks of school,” Bailey wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Ma said a variety of signature events are planned for GWOW, aiming to raise student engagement and community involvement.
“We have signature programs like the Welcome Back Jack Barbecue, Taste of the Hilltop, Hoya Tees, Help-a-Hoya,” Ma said.
Another highlight of the Weeks of Welcome is the 5K Charity run. GPB Special Events Chair Stephanie Lu (COL ’18) said the run provides an opportunity for students to raise money for Garfield Elementary, a local school.
“Taking place on campus, the 5K allows Georgetown students to raise money for Garfield Elementary, a local DC school, without having to even leave the front gates,” Lu wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The GPB is also planning the annual Mr. Georgetown pageant, which will be hosted Friday, Sept. 23. It will include individuals from various clubs being judged by Vice President of Student Affairs Todd Olson.
This year will also feature the return of Taste of the Hilltop, in which various food trucks from around the area come to campus and allow students the opportunity to try out new foods.
According to Bailey, GBP is planning on expanding its advertising of its program this year with banners in Red Square and increased social media outreach.
“This year, GPB is taking a refreshed approach to our marketing strategy on campus,” Bailey said. “We are increasing our visibility and awareness in many ways, such as our banner in Red Square.”
Bailey said GPB hopes GWOW creates an inviting environment for students.
“We are excited to welcome new students to Georgetown and to get them involved in the programming we do around campus,” Bailey said.

Students with meal plans will have new dining options this year, including a meal exchange and mobile ordering program with restaurants in Hoya Court and Cosi, expanded menus and takeaway options at O’Donovan Hall and opportunities to purchase additional tax-free Flex Dollars, according to a campuswide email sent by Associate Vice President for Auxiliary Business Services Joelle Wiese on Friday.
Students will be able to use the mobile ordering service Tapingo to purchase meals at Hoya Court, Bulldog Tavern, Starbucks, Cosi and Einstein’s Bros. Bagels in the Car Barn. The Einstein’s kiosk in Regents Hall will be converted into academic space.
Georgetown University Student Association President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said the changes are the result of negotiations GUSA has had with Georgetown Dining since 2013.
“This has been a long time coming. These conversations have been taking place, been a focus, since my freshman year and are finally coming to fruition so it’s great,” Khan said. “We had a lot of people engaged with dining.”
Khan said the options are an extension of a pilot program in fall 2014 in which meal exchange options were offered through restaurants in Hoya Court.
“This is a great win for students who feel like they don’t have time to sit down in Leo’s, but they want that hot meal,” Khan said. “They want all-you-can-eat, but they can’t sit there to eat.”
Khan also said Grab ‘n’ Go menus will be expanded with new sandwiches and salads, in addition to new halal options in Leo’s. Alongside new Grab ‘n’ Go food offerings, students will be given reusable plastic containers at the beginning of the year to choose food from Leo’s to take with them.
“You go in, you take your hot meal, whatever you want, and then you leave. The next time, you can have it washed at a drop- off location. When you drop yours off, you can pick up a new clean one, so it’s sustainable,” Khan said.
Additionally, students will be able to add additional Flex Dollars to make tax-free purchases at locations around campus.
Khan said GUSA looked at dining models from various universities, including New York University, the University of Chicago, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Northwestern University to recommend changes. The 2014 pilot program used a version of Northwestern’s partnership with Sodexo, in which students are allowed a set number of “equivalency meals” — meals from outside locations — per week as a part of their quarterly meal plan.
Khan said the changes are a positive sign of what Aramark Corporation, Georgetown’s dining partner, should do in the future. The contract is currently up for renewal at the end of 2017.
“This will be an interesting trial run to see what Aramark’s potential could look like, especially given the new contracting negotiations. Now that we have other options to look at, we really want to see if Aramark can truly step up with things that are long overdue,” Khan said.
Stephanie Richardson (COL ’17) said the meal exchange program will satisfy students who are unhappy with traditional offerings at Leo’s.
“I think that students will really take advantage of the opportunity to use their meal plan in so many different places on campus,” Richardson said. “I truly believe people will be far more satisfied with the meal plans offered to us.”
Mark Tremoglie (MSB ’19) said he appreciates the increased variety in dining options.
“It will be great to have more flexibility in our meal plans, and I think students will take advantage of the many new places on campus where meal exchanges are now accepted.”
Tremoglie said the expansion of the Flex Dollar program will be especially useful.
“I especially like that we are now able to add to our Flex Dollars, because I know that running out of Flex before the semester ends is something that has been almost unavoidable to students in the past,” Tremoglie said.

The Georgetown University Student Association is seeking permanent funding to renew the university’s online subscription to The New York Times after the subscription expired at the end of the 2016 spring semester.
For the past two years, the subscription was funded on an annual basis. This year, GUSA hopes to secure a permanent source of funding for the subscription to allow for continuous student access to the subscription year round.
GUSA is currently petitioning the university libraries for funding, after the Provost’s Office rejected initial requests.
GUSA Vice President Chris Fisk (COL ’17) said that with the new funding GUSA will not have to raise money annually.
“GUSA and students don’t have to be fundraising on an ad hoc basis for this every year,” Fisk wrote in an email to The Hoya.
GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff Casey Nolan (COL ’17) said the library is the department most well-suited to handle the costs of the subscription.
“We feel that, with the cost of the subscription and the scope of its purpose, the subscription is best borne by the library,” Nolan wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Since its introduction two years ago, the subscription — which cost $3,700 last year — has been funded by varying university offices, including the French department and the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship, on an annual basis.
GUSA previously applied for funding for the subscription each year by contacting all campus departments to request funding assistance, according to Nolan.
Nolan said GUSA relies on funding from university departments to purchase the subscription due to constraints on GUSA’s budget.
“In the past, funds have been appropriated from generous on-campus donors,” Nolan said. “We really don’t receive enough funds to take on the yearly cost.”
This is not the first time GUSA’s subscription to The New York Times has been cut. Students were unable to use the subscription last summer before access was returned in early September.
GUSA’s Collegiate Readership Program previously paid for print copies of The New York Times, The Washington Post and USA Today around campus until March 2014, when the program was discontinued due to high costs.
GUSA introduced online access to The New York Times in September 2014 to replace the print editions.
The New York Times was chosen for its wide coverage and versatility as a news source, according to Nolan.
“We chose [The] New York Times because we feel it has more of a global scope than other papers, in addition to being more of a general purpose paper, as opposed to something like The Wall Street Journal,” Nolan said.
According to Nolan, if GUSA fails to secure funding it will consider other options to renew the subscription, including returning to finding money on an annual basis.
“If we do not receive funding in full, I anticipate that we will meet at the beginning of the school year to talk about next steps, what is best,” Nolan wrote. “We will decide at a later date whether we want to explore ad hoc funding among the various University departments.”
The transition between GUSA administrations contributed to the lapse in funding for the subscription. The previous GUSA administration did not attempt to renew the subscription while it was in office, according to Nolan.
“Unfortunately, our full administration only came into office in late March/April, leaving us little time to look for funding before the end of the year,” Nolan said. “I do not believe the other administration began searching for funding for the new year.”
Graduate Student Government President Alexander Plum (GRD ’17) said the group is working with GUSA to renew the subscription.
“We are still in discussion with GUSA with regards to funding for The New York Times subscription,” Plum wrote in an email to The Hoya. “No further details are ready to be made public at this time. However, we are committed to working with GUSA on these issues.”

Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service unveiled its newest class of fellows Wednesday, a group that is comprised of figures at the forefront of politics and media.
The fall 2016 fellows include former 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley, former Chief of Staff at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing Scott Mulhauser (GRD ’05), The Washington Post’s Deputy National Political Editor Rebecca Sinderbrand (COL ’99), former Senior Policy and Political Adviser to the Jeb Bush campaign Michael Steel and CNN Politics Editor Juana Summers.
GU Politics Executive Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94) said the program strove to recruit a dynamic and diverse cohort for its third class of fellows since the program’s launch last fall.
“With a former presidential candidate and governor, two top political operatives from both sides of the aisle, and two leading political journalists, we think we hit it out of the park with our fall Fellows,” Elleithee wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We hope Hoyas feel the same.”
Over the semesterlong term, the fellows will engage the university community in weekly discussion sessions, hold office hours for students and contribute to the programming of GU Politics’ lectures, panels and events.
The fellows will also spearhead student strategy teams, in which a select group of students collaborate to research a problem endemic to the American political system and develop a solution over the course of the semester.
Elleithee said the forthcoming November presidential election will provide a unique perspective for the fall 2016 class of fellows.
“With the 2016 presidential election, we expect this group of Fellows to take Hoyas on a dive deeper into national politics and the issues that are front and center in November, like political polarization and race and politics,” Elleithee wrote. “We’re excited for these guys to come to campus and get to work.”
GU Politics Operations and Student Engagement Manager Hanna Hope said she is excited to begin working with them.
“It’s been so fun to see students waiting all summer to see who our Fall Fellows would be, and we’re thrilled at the response that we’re seeing to this group,” Hope wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I love seeing that the Georgetown community has already started interacting with our Fellows online, and we can’t wait to have them on campus soon, livening up our new offices.”
Aaron Bennett (COL ’19), who previously served on the student strategy team of spring 2016 GU Politics fellow Daily Beast Editor Jackie Kucinich said he particularly looks forward to O’Malley’s contribution to the program.
“Headlined by a former presidential candidate and a top presidential campaign adviser on board — I think this is the strongest GU Politics class of fellows yet,” Bennett said.

Universities in Washington, D.C., are exempt from $111 million in local taxes as a result of their nonprofit status, despite recent calls by local leaders to cut tax breaks on large, wealthy universities including Georgetown University and The George Washington University.
Currently, both public and private universities file their taxes under a nonprofit status, recusing them from paying any city or state property taxes. As a result, Georgetown University avoided a $9 million sum, while GWU and American University avoided paying $39 million and $11 million, respectively, according to The Washington Post.
Critics advocate for a payment in lieu of taxes, or PILOT, a program previously implemented in cities such as Boston, to allow universities to maintain their tax status while still requiring that they provide funding for their area.
The Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area opposed proposals for reversing the not-for-profit status universities currently hold but declined to be interviewed by The Hoya. However, the consortium’s president and chief executive, John Cavanaugh, submitted a letter to the editor to The Washington Post published Aug. 25 highlighting the benefits universities offer, which might not be possible without their tax-exempt status.
Georgetown University has also stated its opposition to proposals.
On the city level, any effort to change universities’ status or to implement a PILOT program has seen little traction. Public Affairs Officer for D.C.’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer David Umansky said the office is currently only interested in following existing practices and not in changing policy.
“We follow the law in collecting taxes and all of the other focuses of the CFO, and right now the universities are treated as nonprofit organizations and therefore not subject to the real property tax,” Umansky said. “We simply follow the policy. This is one of those issues that is up to the policymakers.”
Daphne Kenyon, a fellow at the independent think tank Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, said she too feels that universities should maintain their nonprofit status due to the volume of services they provide for cities.
“Nonprofits do make very important contributions to people and to society,” Kenyon said. “They’re a good part of our economy, and they do a lot of things the government would have to do if the government didn’t do them.”
However, she did advocate for a PILOT program as a means of justifying the usage of city services by many universities within the District.
“We’ve written a lot on these payment in lieu of taxes. We do recognize that nonprofits do benefit from services that the cities provide,” Kenyon said. “If there is a fire emergency, it could be the case that a district fire truck could be involved, or a police incident, or when it snows. So those services are paid for by property tax payers in the district. So you could say ‘how is this fair? You have this university with mostly pretty well-off students. Shouldn’t they have to pay some of these costs?’”
The District’s government considered implementing a PILOT program in 2013 through the D.C. Tax Revision Commission, an independent committee of 11 members appointed by former Mayor Vincent Grey. However, the commission did not recommend this kind of program due to the complexities that would accompany taxing District property owned by the federal government.
Kenyon said flexibility should be valued above all if universities are called to discuss their tax statuses.
“It’s not useful to threaten their tax exemption, but particularly for very rich universities in poor cities, I hope that those universities would think flexibly,” Kenyon said. “Improvement must be precise and sensible and not upset the apple cart, so I’m against initiatives that would get rid of the tax exemptions and that would be way too radical.”
On the national stage, lawmakers have also contributed to the discussion of higher-education financing. In February 2016, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) and Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) wrote a letter to 56 private universities with endowments larger than $1 billion requesting information on how their endowments are managed and how profits from endowments are spent.
The letter outlines the significant endowments many universities hold in addition to nonprofit tax exemptions and argues that these are not in line with the rising cost of higher education for students and their families.
“Despite these large and growing endowments, many colleges and universities have raised tuition far in excess of inflation,” the letter reads.
Congress is planning on holding hearings to discuss the findings of this requested information this fall.

The newly constructed Pedro Arrupe, S.J. Residence Hall – formerly known as the Northeast Triangle Residence Hall – began hosting its first residents last week.
Completing construction on the residence hall is one of several projects the Office of Planning and Facilities Management has undertaken this summer, including significant infrastructure renovations of Alumni Square and a housing survey conducted by contractors from architecture firm Ayers Saint-Gross and subconsultant Brailsford & Dunlavey.
Additionally, construction on the John R. Thompson Jr. Intercollegiate Athletic Center was completed this summer following a two-year construction project. The new athletic facility provides roughly 144,000 square feet adjacent to the McDonough Gymnasium, which varsity athletes have been using throughout the summer.
The center houses new practice courts, locker rooms, team meeting rooms, lounge areas and coaches’ offices for men’s and women’s basketball, in addition to new weight training and sports medicine rooms. The $62 million building was funded through philanthropic donations.
According to Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey, Alumni Square residences now all have new hot water heaters and air conditioning units, in addition to new roofs.
“Alumni Square is really an infrastructure project,” Morey said. “Students won’t notice any difference when they walk into the apartments, but they will notice the difference when they live in the apartments.”
Morey said the repairs were necessary because of leaking heaters that could flood rooms in lower levels of the residence halls. The new heaters are more efficient and environmentally sustainable.
“They were old. Those things rot out and they leak,” Morey said. “We had several instances of hot water heaters leaking and, as the water heats, it continues to run and it caused problems in floors below.”
Morey said the project is the first step in the university’s fulfilling the housing commitment it formed with the Georgetown University Student Association as a part of 2017-37 Campus Plan negotiations this summer.
The commitment states that the university will prioritize renovations to existing student housing over construction of new housing to meet the 2010 Campus Plan’s requirement to house 90 percent of students on campus.
“The Alumni Square renovation starts that process. So we’re being consistent with what we’re saying by renovating and putting investments into Alumni Square to make sure that we can provide the proper service to those buildings. It’s an investment in an existing student housing unit that we need to be doing more of,” Morey said. “That is the point.”
The Office of Planning and Facilities Management is also awaiting results from the completed housing survey conducted by Ayers Saint-Gross, which is expected to provide a timeline and suggestions for future renovation and construction on campus.
Ayers Saint-Gross has previously conducted similar surveys for other university campuses, including the George Washington University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Prior to conducting the study, Ayers Saint-Gross, university administrators and GUSA organized a steering committee to work on the final report. Jonice Jackson (COL ’18), former GUSA secretary of residential living, Connor Maytnier (COL ’18) and GUSA Residential Life Policy Team Co-Chair Christopher Holshouser (MSB ’18) sit on the committee.
GUSA Chief of Staff Ari Goldstein (COL ’18) said the student representatives are pushing for a timeline that specifies the process for renovations.
“What we have asked of the administration is that at the conclusion of the housing study, they engage with us about putting together a very specific timeline for renovations. It’s an idea that we saw originally at GWU and other schools where they had a cyclical timeline to complete renovations,” Goldstein said.
Goldstein said he hopes a timeline will bind the university to its housing commitment to avoid situations like Henle Village’s deferred maintenance, which caused some students to lose hot water in their apartments last winter. The Office of Residential Living indefinitely delayed renovations of Henle Village in November 2014 due to a lack of resources.
“The point is that if you commit down the road, then you don’t end up with situations like we had with Henle where a planned renovation is postponed and postponed and postponed because the money isn’t there,” Goldstein said. “We said the housing study is about renovating and we want a timeline that lays out when the necessary renovations on campus are going to take place.”
The survey will enable the university to better understand student needs in addition to crafting a timeline for renovations, according to Maytnier.
“The survey engaged students on everything from price and value, to unit typology, to overall housing satisfaction,” Maytnier wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Morey said he expects Henle renovations will be the university’s next project, followed by additional work in Alumni Square and Village A.
“Alumni Square needs more aesthetic renovations of paint, carpet, lighting, kitchens and I think you will see Village A be in that same category. These are things we know. The purpose of the survey was to kind of balance and put some hardcore data behind what we think is true,” Morey said.
The survey results will also provide a roadmap for future master planning ideas, including the proposed Student Life Corridor, which would run north to south along Tondorf Road and the Leavey Center and replace the facilities offices under Harbin Hall along the ground floor.
“Student collaboration space is really the focus of the student life corridor,” Morey said. “The idea is that eventually I would like to be able to relocate my facilities team and then all that becomes student space.”
Facilities also conducted sewer maintenance in Southwest Quad and Darnall Hall to repair damage to sewer lines, while the pathway between Reiss Hall and Pedro Arrupe, S.J. Hall has opened.
Morey said students played a major role in construction and renovation planning.
“Over the past year, we’ve been working with students on the campus plan and the idea there is that we want to invest in the existing infrastructure. That was a student initiative and it aligned with what we wanted to do in investing in our existing infrastructure versus building new housing,” Morey said. “Students were significantly involved in all that strategy and development and as far as we know are supportive of the campus plan.”

John Carlin says 
August 30, 2016 at 4:58 pm
And can we please get rid of the names Village A and B (sound like prison cells) and name them after significant Jebbies like Matteo Richi or Edmund Campion or alums like Robert Collier, Conde Nast or William Corcoran.

SFS 2016 says 
August 30, 2016 at 7:44 pm
Village B is already named after Alums, hence its official name, Alumni Square.

Concerned Hoya says 
September 1, 2016 at 1:38 pm
Did Robin Morey say anything about hiring new facilities staff to cover the new buildings? Or will the current staff be expected to take on this increased workload without new help?

When Anastasia Somoza (COL ’07) addressed the Democratic National Convention in July, she delivered a powerful endorsement of presidential nominee and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from her motorized chair. Born with cerebral palsy with spastic quadriplegia, the New York-based disability rights advocate now serves as a surrogate for the Clinton campaign after graduating from Georgetown College with a major in government and a minor in English. In an interview with The Hoya, Somoza reflects on the vitriolic election cycle, advances in disability activism and her own years at Georgetown.
Your address at the DNC was both a testament to the inclusivity of the Clinton campaign and a searing indictment of Trump’s divisiveness. You said at one point Trump “didn’t see me, didn’t hear me and definitely did not speak for me.” In a campaign characterized by nasty remarks and mudslinging on both sides, how did you draw this distinction?
Donald Trump has made it clear through all of his rhetoric that he doesn’t represent, will not fight for and is fearful of women, African Americans, Muslims, people with disabilities and other religious and ethnic minorities – in other words anyone who isn’t the all-American white male. It’s impossible to even attempt to claim to be the best candidate to address the most pressing needs of Americans and our interests when your core policy proposals are centered on deporting all immigrants and building a wall. Not to mention the fact Republican administrations are characterized by limiting government and, more often than not, the cuts are made in the areas of greatest need, including reducing funding to Medicaid and Medicare, both of which are relied upon by the disabled and elderly nationwide. By contrast, Hillary began her career at the Children’s Defense Fund fighting for the needs of families who have children with disabilities, working to increase the numbers of African Americans and other minorities registering to vote, advocating for women’s rights to be seen as human rights and fighting against all odds to make sure health care is a right for all Americans rather than a privilege afforded to some.
To cite a breaking example of the stark differences between the campaigns and candidates, Hillary has just announced her comprehensive agenda on mental health, which demonstrates her action toward addressing an unmet need. As far as I know, Donald Trump has yet to address this in any substantive way.
You came to the national spotlight when you plead with President Bill Clinton in a televised town hall at age 10 to place students like your twin sister Alba in regular classes away from a special education track. Over a decade later, how do you think policies for disabled students in the classroom have fared?
Families across this country are still waging battles at the school district level to make sure their children are included in mainstream classrooms and then, once they are, that they are given the appropriate support and access to accommodations, which can sometimes include assistive technology and individualized adjustments to their academic program. So the work to level the playing field in the classroom is far from over, but beyond that, as a young woman with a disability, I have struggled in the transition from academia into the work force. I am working on increasing the employment of people with disabilities in private industry through tax incentive programs and creating guidelines for a more inclusive workforce.
How can we best be allies to the disabled community?
In your daily lives, one of the important ways everyone can be an ally to those of us with disabilities is being inclusive of us in all school-related activities, groups and programs. If you notice an elevator on campus or a D.C. Metro station that is out of service, take the time to make the call to get it fixed.
Overall, how would you characterize your experience at Georgetown?
While at Georgetown I felt extremely supported by faculty and staff. What I remember sometimes being an issue was the frequency with which elevators on campus would break down and other physical accessibility-related issues, which from what I’ve heard have improved drastically over the years.
The Class of 2020 begins its freshman year this fall. What advice do you have for incoming students?
My advice to incoming freshmen would be to take every opportunity to meet people and discover ways in which you can become actively involved in campus life and really engage in activities that you are passionate about. As far as academics are concerned, it’s important to make the most of the time you have at the beginning of each academic term to sit in on classes and engage in conversations with professors about the content of the course and how the professor will determine your progress throughout the semester. For example, in my case I knew I was more comfortable writing papers than I was taking multiple choice exams. So to the extent that it’s possible, choose classes that fit your learning style and provide you with opportunities to highlight your strengths. Also, even if you think you’re confident about what you’d like to major and minor in, be sure to allow yourself the time and space to explore a variety of academic disciplines.
What are your plans for the months before the election and beyond?
I’m a believer in living in the moment, so I don’t have a five- or 10-year plan, but between now and the election I am honored and excited to be speaking as a surrogate on the campaign trail in support of Hillary. I’m also looking forward to a handful of speaking engagements this fall, including one that’s bringing me back to the Hilltop at the end of October. There are many thrilling projects and opportunities in the works that I hope to be able to elaborate on at a later date.
I’m consistently pursuing any opportunities to increase the visibility, inclusion and engagement of people with disabilities in everyday life. I’m currently working with a team of colleagues to open a parent resource center for families of children with disabilities in China. Some of my other areas of personal interest include increasing the accessibility of travel both nationally and internationally to people with disability. The most timely concern is increasing the voter registration of people with disabilities and facilitating their ability to vote.
