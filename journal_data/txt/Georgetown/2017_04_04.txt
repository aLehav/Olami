Students are set to vote on a campuswide referendum later this month to elect Georgetown University Student Association senators by class rather than geographic district.
The bill aims to encourage students from underrepresented communities to participate in GUSA, and also updates the student government’s bylaws to prevent exclusion based on discriminatory factors. Proponents of the referendum argue that the changes will make the senate more representative of the student body.
The senate voted unanimously in favor of the referendum Sunday. The session was briefly thrown off course after Deputy Chief of Staff of Health and Wellness Will Emery (COL ’19), who represented the GUSA executive, appeared to suggest the administration was taking a last-minute stance against the referendum.
“After talking to more people, specifically from [Leaders in Education About Diversity] and the [Center for Multicultural Equity & Access], we realized that class year districts would make it more difficult to earn a senate seat, thereby having the potential to decrease diversity,” Emery told the senators, reading from the statement.
Emery added, “Therefore, we cannot support the referendum.”
The final comment was not approved by GUSA President Kamar Mack (COL ’19) and Vice President Jessica Andino (COL ’18). The senate interpreted Emery’s comments as a sudden policy reversal by the executive, which had not previously expressed opposition to the referendum.
Senator Scott Lowder (COL ’17) said the apparent policy change amounted to an insult to the senate lobbed by the executive.
Executive press secretary Aaron Bennett (COL ’19) said the comment was not authorized and the executive would like to continue discussing the referendum. Bennett and Mack were not aware Emery had added the comment at the Sunday meeting when interviewed by The Hoya last night.
“The Executive supports the idea of opening important questions such as this to the student body, but has heard concerns about diversity under this new plan and we would like to hear more open debate/discussion on ways to ensure minority representation in the Senate,” Bennett wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The current senate has 29 senators representing eight geographic districts. If passed, the April 25-27 referendum would allocate 24 seats by class year: six seats for freshman, five seats each for sophomores, juniors and seniors, and three at-large seats open to students from the upper three classes. The referendum requires support from 25 percent of the student body with a two-thirds margin to take effect.
If the referendum passes, senate elections – excluding those for freshmen and at-large senators – would be held in the spring rather than the fall. The referendum also proposes codifying existing GUSA diversity programs, including ElectHer, which seeks to recruit female students for elected positions, and A GUSA That Looks Like Georgetown, which seeks to encourage students from underrepresented populations to run for elected positions.
An additional question on the referendum would update the GUSA bylaws on inclusivity, banning a student’s exclusion from the association on the basis of citizenship status, gender identity or expression, ability or disability or any other characteristics covered by federal or Washington, D.C. law. Voters can vote for the two questions independently and can choose to answer only one.
Lowder said he was pleased to learn the executive did not intend to oppose the referendum outright, but said the miscommunication creates a larger concern about the relationship between the senate and the executive.
“When we have a representative in the senate, we rely on them to speak for the executive, especially concerning something as huge as a constitutional amendment,” Lowder said in an interview with The Hoya. “So the idea that what was said on behalf of the executive in a meeting about amending the entire constitution of GUSA, the idea that that was not accurate, is very concerning to me.”
GUSA senate speaker Richie Mullaney (COL ’18) said the shift to class-year representation are more effective and representative than geographic representation for the senate.
“In my opinion, the Senate’s geographic district system is an example of GUSA taking itself too seriously. While geographic districts might work for the real government, they don’t provide the same benefits for a student association,” Mullaney wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Students have a much stronger connection to their class year than the part of campus they live in year to year.”

Why aren’t senators elected by school or college instead of class year or geographic district?  I would think that we all associate with our schools more than we do class years…right?  As an SFS student I feel that I should be advocating more for my school more than anything. I know my school has different needs than my NHS friends.

Georgetown joined 30 peer institutions in signing an amicus brief condemning the effects of President Donald Trump’s executive order restricting entry of citizens from six Muslim-majority countries Sunday.
The brief is part of other measures announced by University President John J. DeGioia yesterday in response to Trump’s immigration order. Other initiatives include a training session for immigrant students on their rights if they are detained and advocacy for comprehensive immigration reform.
In light of the current national climate on immigration, the university community also came together last night in a vigil organized by the administration in solidarity with vulnerable communities on campus. About 50 students, faculty, administrators and members of the religious community attended the vigil, which highlighted religious teachings on immigration and refugees.
In a campuswide email Monday, DeGioia highlighted the contributions of campus communities now vulnerable under the Trump administration.
“We recognize the invaluable role that our Muslim and international students, scholars, staff, and faculty play — and the importance of protecting the ability of all members of our community to freely practice their religion,” DeGioia wrote.
Trump’s March 6 order cited national security concerns as a reason to enact a 90-day suspension on immigration from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
The amicus brief was filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Maryland, which is set to hear oral arguments in a lawsuit brought against Trump and other members of his administration May 8. The plaintiffs in the case are requesting a stay of the order.
An amicus curiae brief, otherwise known as a “friend of the court” brief, is a legal instrument through which a person or group that is not party to a lawsuit can petition the court on behalf of the plaintiffs or defendants and thus sway the court’s decision.
The brief, signed by institutions including Harvard University, Yale University, Columbia University and Stanford University, specifically cited the benefits gained from the signatories’ diverse student bodies as an interest in the lawsuit.
“Each amicus has a global mission and benefits from the contributions of diverse students, faculty, staff, and scholars from around the world,” the brief reads. “Because amici seek to educate future world leaders, attract the world’s best scholars, faculty, and students, and work across international borders, they rely on their ability to welcome international students, faculty, and scholars into their communities.”
The universities argued in the brief that international students, faculty and scholars are vital to their interests and cited the fact that U.S. universities accepted more than 1 million international students as a reason for suspending the ban. Such students, the brief says, accounted for 5 percent of national enrollment in the 2015-16 academic year.
The faculty senate, which consists of 75 full-time faculty members from the main campus, medical school and Law Center alongside senior administrators, announced in a campuswide email yesterday that they approved a resolution March 20 supporting those affected by the order, citing “America’s proud tradition” of welcoming immigrants.
“It is not for the United States government to adopt one religion and to reject individuals simply because of their religion or nationality,” the resolution reads. “We resolve to support and protect our faculty, staff, and students who have been and will be harmed by the order, and to stand up for their rights, including the protection of personal information, unless required by legal process.”
Director of Jewish Life Rabbi Rachel Gartner, who spoke at last night’s vigil, said the Jewish community feels a special bond of empathy with immigrants.
“We understand ourselves as a wandering people, and we understand what it’s like to be welcomed to a country when it’s convenient for that country and tossed out when it is fashionable,” Gartner said. “The Jewish community stands with our immigrant community because 36 times in our Torah — no less than 36 times — we are exhorted to treat the sojourner who lives among us exactly as we would treat ourselves.”
Although Trump has stated that he seeks to protect individuals present in the United States without authorization who would be granted relief under the DREAM Act, multiple reports of such detainments by Immigration and Customs Enforcement have surfaced in recent days. Against this backdrop, advocacy student group UndocuHoyas launched the inaugural UndocuWeek this week.
Luis Gonzalez (COL ’19), a student without documentation, said this kind of university rhetoric is what has made him feel welcome at Georgetown.
“The fact that as students we are able to put aside our differences and be able to listen and to have an open mind is what continues to convince me Georgetown is my home,” Gonzalez said. “I hope people in our community realize the huge impact they have in making sure those who are affected by drastic policy changes, hatred, among other things, feel supported.”
Aly Panjwani (SFS ’19), a Muslim student who attended the vigil, said the university has a special duty to advocate for the international community because of its religious background and history.
“Georgetown, a Jesuit Catholic university, with its history of participating in these oppressive power structures, has a responsibility to fervently counter this dangerous ideology in the White House,” Panjwani said. “Furthermore, it is these vulnerable communities that bring diversity and value to our Georgetown community and we must do our utmost to protect them.”
DeGioia emphasized other initiatives in the email, including the hiring of undocumented student adviser Arelis Palacios in November. He concluded that the international character of the university is essential to its mission.
“Ours is a global community — one made stronger by our religious, cultural and international diversity,” DeGioia wrote. “Today, and as we have throughout our history, we will make the effort required of us to support, sustain, and advance our global character, our commitment to religious diversity and interreligious dialogue, our commitment to freedom of speech, and our work to promote dialogue and encourage civility.”

Trumps temporary immigration ban on countries with active terrorists training camps is common sense. No one is trying to ban anyone from freedom to practice religion. The US and Europe are being targeted by groups such as ISIS which has a strong presence in all of the countries on the watch list.
 Most if not all of these countries are in a state of chaos if not out right civil war.Yeah it’s just great that everyone hates Trump but in this case he is right. It is also his legal right under the constitution. If Obama were still in office and he made the same request none of you altruistic, liberal minded, ivory tower, students would say a word? You people had better pray that no terrorists come in while this presidential mandate is blocked!

Hey Rachel, how come Israel doesn’t let in this Muslim refugees?  Israel is a lot closer?  Will you advocate for Israel to accept them?  Doesn’t Israel have a responsibility here?  Why is it Jews are all for other groups immigrating to Europe and America, but have very strict, some might say harsh rules when it comes to immigration to Israel?  
You can take all these Muslim refugees in, but you won’t?  Why not?  And if the Jewish state of Israel won’t do it, why should America?

Another maddening article filled with statements that are irrelevant to the Executive Order itself, and give clear and obvious witness that it has not actually been read in its entirety. Georgetown as well as the other entities mentioned as in support of the amicus brief (Harvard, Yale, Columbia and Stanford) are educational institutions, correct? In order for an accurate and valuable commentary on any executive order, surely it would be expected that the document should be read and digested. So please….READ THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. Don’t just rely, as it seems many of you dear students have done, on a couple of media sound bites. READ THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. By the way, there are two Executive Orders with the same title: Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States. The first, issued January 27th has now been rescinded and replaced with a second, dated March 6. Both available on the website whitehouse.gov . But I’m not going to do any more homework for you.  Read the Order and then you will have something worth bringing to the discussion. As a previous commentator noted, the Order is NOT a ban based on religion. There are in fact, forty-two Muslim majority countries that are NOT under the watch list and only six that are.
After you read the Order, to shed some very necessary light on the entire refugee and immigrant issue, I would suggest you bring up a very pertinent article on Imprimis, the publication of Hillsdale College: Who We Are as a People – the Syrian Refugee Question, by Edward Erler. His premise is that Americans and others worldwide have rejected the value of belief in absolute truth based on God and of His natural order in creation and have replaced truth with subjectivism. (My truth is just as valuable and true as your truth.)  Then the only thing that is of real value is tolerance for all viewpoints and a corresponding committment to diversity. Note that it is a COMMITMENT to diversity. Supporting the principle of allowing people from terrorist countries to freely enter the US with improper checks is a clear proof that one is “truly committed to diversity” (willing to make the supreme sacrifice of experiencing possible terrorist activity) This commitment to diversity has replaced commitment to the natural law and the revealed truth of Jesus Christ. So….read the EO and the Erler article, then go grab some beers and have a discussion.

In one of her first speeches since the November election, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged the United States to continue to lead worldwide peace efforts and advance the rights of women in a Gaston Hall speech on Friday.
“We have to ask, will we be left behind or will we continue to lead the way? I hope the answer is that we will do whatever it takes to make our country and the world stronger and more secure,” Clinton said. “Standing up for our values, for human rights and opportunities, security for all.”
The address, part of the awards ceremony for this year’s Hillary Rodham Clinton Award for Advancing Women in Peace and Security, also launched several critiques of President Donald Trump, including his administration’s claims of using “alternative facts.”
“Women are not inherently more peaceful than men,” Clinton said. “That is a stereotype. That belongs in the alternative.”
Throughout her address, Clinton advocated the spread of gender equity in the United States and other nations. Increased worldwide gender equity is in the United States’ best interests, according to Clinton.
“But — and this is what I want to really impress upon you — this is strategic and necessary for matters of peace, prosperity and security. It is not a partisan issue. It’s a human issue,” Clinton said. “A rising tide of women’s rights lifts entire nations.”
The Trump administration’s first budget, released March 16, proposed $54 billion in cuts to the federal government, including to the Department of State. This puts the United States’ success at risk, according to Clinton.
“This administration’s proposed cuts to international health, development and diplomacy would be a blow to women and children and a grave mistake for our country,” Clinton said.
According to Clinton, diplomacy, rather than military power, is the best path to ensure the United States’ security.
“These distinguished men and women who served in uniform recognize that turning our back on diplomacy won’t make our country safer,” Clinton said. “It will undermine our security and our standing in the world.”
Advocating gender equity, Clinton said, must be a focus of U.S. foreign policy resources.
“Standing up for the rights and opportunities of women and girls must be a cornerstone of American global leadership,” Clinton said. “And therefore, it must be woven throughout our foreign policy with the resources, staffing, accountability and attention needed to back up that commitment.”
The United States must also look to ensure that women are included in efforts to create a more peaceful world, according to Clinton.
“If we are to build more just, free and peaceful countries and indeed a world, it’s not enough just to pay lip service to empowering women,” Clinton said. “We have to take seriously their concerns and give them the tools to be equal partners in helping to shape the world they inhabit.”
Clinton also addressed the Middle East refugee crisis. About 5 million people have fled Syria since the start of the civil war in 2011, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson extended a ruling March 31 blocking Trump’s second executive order temporarily barring immigration from six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and suspending refugee resettlement for 120 days.
Clinton said the United States must play a role in supporting refugees.
“This is especially important now, when we have, across the globe, more than 60 million refugees fleeing not only conflicts, but famine and drought and disease,” Clinton said. “And we have to come to terms with that because, again, it’s not just somebody else’s problem.”
This year’s awards went to four individuals whose work ensured women played an active role in peace negotiations between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, a paramilitary group known as FARC.
The Colombian government and FARC signed a peace deal in November 2016, ending almost 50 years of conflict within Colombia.
Peace deals are most successful when women play a role in negotiations, according to Clinton.
“History does show that when women are at the peace table, they bring together coalitions and they work really hard to build consensus,” Clinton said. “And they are the ones most likely to shine a bright light on issues of human rights, transitional justice, national reconciliation and economic renewal.”
Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security Executive Director Melanne Verveer (SFS ’66, GRD ’69), who served as ambassador-at-large for global women’s issues from 2009 to 2013, presented the award to former Vice President of Colombia and lead negotiator Humberto de la Calle, Colombia Deputy Attorney General Maria Paulina Riveros and Colombia Office of the High Commissioner for Peace Thematic Director Elena Ambrosi, who both played a key role in negotiations, and journalist Jineth Bedoya, who advocates against sexual violence.
Verveer said this year’s award looks to honor those who will play a role in creating peace and prosperity in Colombia.
“The torch of reconciliation rests with the women of Colombia,” Verveer said.
Clinton said the peace agreement will require effort from both sides to ensure it is successful.
“Now like so many peace agreements, as hard as it was to get to it after 50 years of war, it is just the first step,” Clinton said. “Implementing peace will be a constant task.”
Prior to the event, students started lining up at about 10:30 p.m. Thursday night for a seat inside Gaston Hall. Students were still waiting in line to enter Gaston Hall when doors closed at 10:20 a.m.

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) emphasized the local values that guide her administration’s policies and affirmed her commitment to resisting congressional interference in local matters during her 2017 State of the District Address, her third such address to the District, on Thursday.
Speaking from the University of the District of Columbia’s campus, Bowser said D.C. continues to be one of the United States’ pre-eminent cities, as well as highlighted rising tension between District and congressional leaders on matters including physician-assisted suicide and assault rifle legislation.
“Because of our D.C. values, we are the human rights capital. Our diversity alone does not make us great; our embrace of it does,” Bowser said. “That’s why, since Election Day this past November, we have worked to ensure that no one undermines our core D.C. values of fairness and equality, of mutual respect and justice, of falling down and getting back up, and of self-determination.”
Bowser also discussed D.C. statehood, one of the defining issues of her mayoral tenure, while underscoring her belief in District autonomy.
“Last November, I was only the second Mayor to meet with the then President-elect Trump. I wanted to make it clear to him who we are,” Bowser said. “We are tax-paying Americans. We are no more dependent on the federal government than any other state. We don’t want anything special, just full access to our birthright, full representation for the taxes that we pay. And the only way to get there  is statehood for the District of Columbia.”
Bowser also called on Trump and Congress to improve D.C. infrastructure, including the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium as well as federal roads, bridges and parks.
She also repeated calls for increased public school funding, affordable housing, arts funding and re-entry programs for prisoners in the Federal Bureau of Prisons.
Bowser said in all local issues, Congress should allow the District to make its own decisions. Bowser also alluded to her speech at the Women’s March on Washington on Jan. 21, in which she argued for District autonomy.
“And as I told 1 million women at the Women’s March  —  if the Congress can’t help D.C. with our priorities, the best thing they can do is leave us alone,” Bowser said.
Bowser went on to stress Washington’s role as a sanctuary city that welcomes immigrants — a status Bowser reaffirmed Jan. 25.
“We are a sanctuary city that’s committed to protecting the rights of our immigrants, the underserved and every single person whose contributions have been discounted or dismissed for way too long,” Bowser said. “This is who we are. These are D.C. values. These are the priorities we are fighting for.”
Bowser also advocated for equal treatment of all children in D.C., citing the recent public outcry about missing black and Latino youth in the District.
“We do all of this because it matters to me as Mayor, and it matters to the hardworking men and women of the Metropolitan Police Department who are bringing our missing children home,” Bowser said.
Since December 2016, MPD has used social media accounts to publicize information for critical missing persons, individuals under the age of 15 or over the age of 65, as well as chronic runaways and those who present an imminent danger to themselves or others.
The initiative has drawn national attention to a perceived increase in missing persons of color, though the MPD maintains there is no significant increase in missing young people in the area.
Bowser also noted that she will soon be presenting D.C. City Council with a budget for the next fiscal year.
Bowser said her budget will make the single largest investment in public education and emergency medical services in the District’s history.
She also stressed the need to invest in child care and paid family leave while creating a greater pool of jobs and promoting small business growth.
Bowser also spoke about her five-year plan to reduce unemployment among black residents of the District and to increase prosperity for all citizens, highlighting her desire to provide solutions for the homeless population in the city.
“We are forging a path to make homelessness rare, brief and non-recurring. We are transforming our family homeless system and together we will end veteran homelessness. But we must do more to protect and preserve affordable housing,” Bowser said.
Bowser indicated she would work with Councilmember Elissa Silverman (I-At Large) to craft a proposal to use D.C. government installations for child care centers. Silverman said she will continue to work with Bowser to promote family-centric laws.
“I look forward to continuing to work with Mayor Bowser and my Council colleagues to advance legislation that will make the District more accessible and affordable for working families,” Silverman wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Silverman, who is a member of the Housing Preservation Strike Force that Bowser created in 2015, said she is glad to hear Bowser remains committed to increasing funding for the District’s affordable units.
“Affordable housing remains one of my top priorities and a necessity for District residents to thrive — both for native Washingtonians and new residents who want to invest in making the District their home,” Silverman wrote.

The university is planning to collect data on April 28’s Georgetown Day conduct violations, including Georgetown University Police Department calls, leading the Georgetown University Student Association to hold a “Save Georgetown Day” event April 28 in an effort to encourage students to be more responsible.
GUSA President Kamar Mack (COL ’19) said the event was inspired by the administration’s desire to address the concerns of Georgetown Day critics, including professors.
“Stakeholders on the university side who do not support Georgetown Day primarily include professors. Classes are interrupted because students show up drunk and because there’s a lot of noise on the front lawn,” Mack said. “Jessica and I inherited a situation where the university expressed that they wanted to start events after 4:00 p.m., and they wanted GUSA to engage in some sort of educational event about alcohol and drug safety practices.”
Main Campus Executive Faculty Senate notes from recent years show discussions over the impact of Georgetown Day on classes, including the formation of a committee in fall 2016 to investigate the consequences of the day. In the March 17 notes, the committee says the university is evaluating Georgetown Day.
“The University will communicate to students through the Provost’s Student Advisory Committee, made up of student government leaders from across the Main Campus, that we are closely evaluating Georgetown Day this year with particular attention to excessive drinking and health and safety concerns,” the notes read.
The notes also suggest faculty should be allowed to reschedule Friday classes, and that “student government leaders will consider what efforts they may make as a group to increase education around the purpose of the day and the risks of excessive drinking,” and that these efforts will be monitored.
Member of the Main Campus Executive Faculty’s Georgetown Day Committee Reena Aggarwal said Georgetown Day serves as a uniting event for the Georgetown community.
“As the semester winds down, Georgetown Day provides a great opportunity for our Georgetown community to come together,” Aggarwal wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Mack said that while the university has not confirmed how it will use the data, students should be on high alert.
“The big goal is to make sure students understand the layout of this year’s Georgetown Day. It’s important to know the university is on high alert,” Mack said. “They’ll be tracking the number of GERMS transports, they’ll be tracking the amount of SNAPS calls, they’ll be tracking GUPD — how much they have to pay GUPD — they’re tracking all of this. What they’re going to do with this data is something we do not know.”
Part of the university’s tracking, which includes counting the number of student volunteers, is in response to changes in the Georgetown Day budget for this year. The GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee, which appropriates the student activities fee, did not allocate Georgetown Day any funding this year after the organizing committee forgot to submit a funding request.
“Jessica and I have been able to get the university to commit to providing money from Student Affairs and the provost office, so we have funding,” Mack said. “What we don’t have is people to put the events on. The university is not going to give us money unless we have adequate volunteers and detailed program proposals.”
Despite the event’s billing to “Save Georgetown Day,” Mack said he’s not worried about the university cancelling Georgetown Day, but rather enforcing a different structure or making it harder for planned events to take place.
“The university can’t ‘cancel’ Georgetown Day. They can’t tell students, ‘Hey, no parties.’ By nature of the fact that it’s at the very end of the school year, it’s very difficult for the conduct office to adjudicate all the cases,” Mack said. “But what they can do is say, ‘We won’t throw in any money for food trucks, or we will shut down parties in a split second.’”
Mack said he hopes the event helps students prepare to safely celebrate the end of classes.
“Students are going to party regardless,” Mack said. “The goal is just to make the day as safe as possible and to make sure we have programming. That’s the difference between a day when people just party and Georgetown Day, as a tradition.”
Student Advocacy Office Director Jack Nalen (COL ’17) said he hopes the event will help students understand their rights and responsibilities as members of the university and neighborhood community overall.
“My goal for this event is to have every person in attendance walking out feeling a lot more confident in their rights as a student, no matter what living capacity they may be in, as well as their responsibilities as a student,” Nalen said. “We’re members of this community and it’s equally important for students to know how to politely stand up for their rights as it is for them to know how to avoid certain situations that are unbecoming to a Georgetown student.”
While SAO normally prepares their advocates for Georgetown Day, Nalen said this event will allow the office’s mission of student safety and appropriate conduct to reach a wider audience.
“This isn’t going to be any different from a talk I would give on Georgetown Day in the past, now there’s just more of an audience. This is the first time that there will be a large format for this talk to go on,” Nalen said. “I know that the event is organized under the ‘Save Georgetown Day’ banner, but I think that especially the conduct portion of it and the student health on that day is something that can be appreciated day in and day out.”
Clarification: This article previously stated the university would collect data on conduct violations, including Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service requests; the university does collect data on GERMS requests, however, this data is not used for information on conduct violations.
Correction: This article previously named Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service as the Georgetown Rapid Medical Service.

Two students are planning to launch an It’s On Us chapter, an initiative that works to have students take a pledge to end sexual violence on college campuses, in conjunction with Sexual Assault Awareness month.
The Obama administration launched It’s On Us in 2014 in an effort to end sexual violence on college campuses as part of former Vice President Joe Biden’s mission to end sexual violence in the United States. The movement declares that sexual assault is not only a crime committed by a perpetrator against a victim, but a broader societal problem involving everyone.
The chapter is set to launch Wednesday on Copley Lawn by urging students to take the pledge — a personal commitment to help keep women and men safe from sexual assault. It’s On Us is also looking to be a visible source of information on campus during Sexual Assault Awareness month, which takes place every April in an effort to raise awareness of the prevalence of sexual violence.
Chapter Coordinator Jessica Scoratow (COL ’18) said the chapter hopes to play an active role on campus.
“We would be a subunit of that broader unit, but I do want to get it registered with the university so that I have those wheels in motion to go ahead and do next year to get funding, to bring speakers, to do consent workshops, to sort of elevate the issue,” Scoratow said.
The Georgetown University Police Department will be providing monetary and marketing support to the campaign launch, including a banner to promote the chapter, according to GUPD Chief of Police Jay Gruber.
Gruber said sexual assault is a persistent problem on all campuses.
“Sexual assault continues to be a problem on college campuses,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is crucial that we continue to educate our community on the issue of sexual assault and look to our community to help end the problem.”
Organizations such as Newsweek and MTV as well as universities such as Syracuse University and University of Utah have already partnered with It’s On Us.
According to Scoratow, the university has been difficult to communicate with in regards to sexual assault awareness initiatives.
“As far as university support, it’s a little bit difficult, to be honest, because I think that the administration wants to be sure that they are not calling attention to things that don’t need to have attention called to them,” Scoratow said. “They don’t want to have too much visibility or sexual violence issues on campus, just because oftentimes it can come off in the media and in a broader national sense that if students are advocating and arousing issues means that that issue is very prevalent.”
It’s On Us Georgetown Chapter Coordinator Melissa Morgan (COL ’18) said Sexual Assault Awareness month is needed to highlight an issue that is not often discussed on Georgetown’s campus.
“How the University actually handles sexual assault and harassment cases isn’t often discussed,” Morgan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We need initiatives like Sexual Assault Awareness Month to remind Hoyas that sexual assault happens here, that we can work to prevent it, and that we should be urging the university to embrace a sexual assault policy that supports victims and combats rape culture.”
Correction: This article previously included a quote stating there are not other advocacy efforts on campus for sexual assault; this is incorrect.

This is the definition of fake news.  Sexual assault is CONSTANTLY discussed at Georgetown.  This is why people don’t believe feminists.  Because there’s the constant hyperbole and lies.  
This new club is just a propaganda effort for feminists to try and get additional funds and attention and push the “women are victims” narrative.  What’s funny is they don’t realize most people see through the b.s.

This is flat-out offensive and so ill-informed. Ever heard of SAPE? Ever heard of Take Back the Night?  Of course not, because that doesn’t fit your narrative of founding an unnecessary new organization to raise your own profile as an “activist.”

In light of proposed budget cuts to the U.S. National Park Service, Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) formally requested that the federal government transfer oversight and management of five land sites operated by the NPS to the District’s control in a letter last week.
In President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for 2018, he proposed a 12 percent, or $1.5 billion, cut to the U.S. Department of the Interior, which oversees the NPS.
The locations Bowser has requested control over include the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium located two miles east of the U.S. Capitol, downtown’s Franklin Square and three public golf courses.
D.C. City Administrator Rashad Young said the properties should be transferred to D.C. to avoid the nearly 12 percent cut to the NPS budget projected under Trump’s proposed 2018 budget.
Young said the District’s government is better equipped to see that these properties are maintained for District residents.
“As City Administrator I believe that the initial budget proposal presented by the Trump Administration is inconsistent with our D.C. values,” Young wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In a March 29 letter to Trump, Bowser said her goal is to renovate the properties for Washington residents and invest in infrastructure projects to spur job growth in the city.
“You have often said that infrastructure investments are key priorities of your Administration. And, as Mayor of Washington D.C., I could not agree more. The rehabilitation of our infrastructure not only strengthens and renews that infrastructure, but it creates jobs and lifts our economy as well,” Bowser wrote. “We stand ready to partner with you to invest in infrastructure and to create more economic opportunities.”
Bowser also argued that the locations have been neglected by the NPS and thus not expanded or invested in.
Bowser doubled down on the initiative during a press conference yesterday, arguing that ensuring infrastructure projects remain innovative is a priority for her administration.
“They have all suffered from the inattention of the National Parks Service, and we are asking the president to work with us on getting control over those properties so that we can make the necessary investments,” Bowser said at the press conference.
Jeremy Barnum, a public affairs officer for the NPS, maintained that the agency has a productive relationship with the District government.
“The National Park Service has a close working relationship with the District of Columbia government and its many agencies,” Barnum wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In her letter, Bowser specified the renovations her administration would pursue if granted control over the properties.
For the RFK stadium, Bowser said she would revitalize the property to sustain a broader range of uses.
Currently, the stadium is restricted by its lease for sports and entertainment uses, but Bowser said the D.C. government would be willing to fund housing, retail and other initiatives on the 100 acres included in the stadium property.
“The site is surrounded by strong, diverse neighborhoods that would greatly benefit from activating the sea of parking lots that divide their access to the Anacostia River,” Bowser wrote. “We believe the site can be transformed to create and preserve green space, add much needed housing and retail, include a sports and/or entertainment purpose and above all generate jobs for our residents and the region.”
Barnum said the NPS does not have the authority to extend the stadium’s lease or to authorize uses for the space beyond those permitted by Congress.
Bowser’s letter also addressed her plans for the administration of Franklin Square, located between I and K streets NW.
According to Bowser’s letter, the NPS failed to complete the functional improvements necessary to adequately serve the high volume of visitors the park sees each year.
In 2012, the NPS and the Washington government worked together to repair the park and bring local vendors to the area, but the project has not moved forward in recent months due to delays that Bowser attributed to the NPS.
Barnum said the NPS is proud of the joint efforts between the agency and the District government.
“This has been a groundbreaking effort that will not just improve a single park, but will reinvent how the city and the NPS can work together to manage the treasures that are the national parks of the District of Columbia,” Barnum wrote.
Finally, Bowser detailed her administration’s plans for the Langston Initiative, which manages renovations to the city’s three public golf courses: the Rock Creek Park Golf Course, the East Potomac Park Golf Course and the Langston Golf Course.
According to Bowser’s letter, her administration would not only make necessary repairs to the courses but also utilize public-private partnerships with D.C. businesses to create a ‘world class urban golf system,’ which would include family entertainment facilities and retail opportunities around the courses.
Barnum said the NPS is supportive of the Langston Initiative, regardless of who leads the project.
“We are hopeful that this initiative will result in revitalized courses that will remain affordable for the golfing community that has enjoyed these courses for generations, as well as increased recreational opportunities for D.C. residents and visitors,” Barnum wrote.

Three Georgetown University Law Center students working with the GULC Appellate Courts Immersion Clinic contributed to the legal defense of students with mental and physical disabilities in a Supreme Court case, which was decided 8-0 in their favor March 22.
Led by Brian Wolfman, a GULC professor who directs the clinic, and clinic teaching fellow Wyatt Sassman, the students, Claire Chevrier (LAW ’17), Anna Deffebach (LAW ’17) and Meghan Breen (LAW ’17) researched and wrote parts of the opening merits brief, which detailed the facts of the case, before the court in Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District.
The court decided on behalf of the plaintiffs, Endrew F., a young boy with autism in Colorado, and his parents, who sued the Douglas County School District under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The plaintiffs argued the education Endrew was receiving did not qualify as a “free appropriate public education” as required by the federal special education law.
Schools must now develop more ambitious plans designed by school teachers and administrators for students with disabilities. Before this ruling, the federal Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, maintained that the law simply demands “de minimis,” or a program that shows the student has made some annual progress.
The plaintiffs argued that this standard allowed for vague interpretations of the law at the detriment to students with disabilities.
According to Chevrier, although the IDEA requires all schools receiving federal funding to provide students with a free, appropriate public education, the case determined what level of benefit fulfilled the act’s requirements.
Deffebach said the case serves as a landmark decision in disability law, because it affects students with disabilities in every public school across the country.
“Almost everybody knows somebody, whether a family friend, or a relative, or a friend’s family member, who needs a unique education, whether it’s ADD or dyslexia or autism,” Deffebach said. “It’s something that affects a lot of people.”
Wolfman began work on the case in 2015 when he was directing Stanford Law School’s Supreme Court Litigation Clinic.
He said he was inspired to join the case because the IDEA did not go far enough in assuring the rights of disabled students.
“Congress said [the IDEA] had ambitious goals for children with disabilities, and the notion that in substance all they had to be provided was educational advancement that was merely more than de minimis, just above trivial, struck me as just outrageous in the moral or ethical sense, and so we wanted to pursue the case,” Wolfman said.
Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts agreed with this sentiment while writing for the unanimous court.
“When all is said and done, a student offered an educational program providing ‘merely more than de minimis’ progress from year to year can hardly be said to have offered an education at all,” Roberts wrote. “The IDEA demands more.”
The Supreme Court’s decision will immediately affect school systems, according to Wolfman.
Wolfman said this decision can help schools make the plans more closely tailored to the needs of students.
“If a school district wants to do the right thing, its legal counsel will inform it of the importance of this decision, and that should have immediate downstream effects on meetings that parents have with teachers to design IEP,” Wolfman said.
The three law students who worked on the case all agreed that an important next step is access to resources to enforce the ruling in low-income school districts.
Breen said education of law is crucial to ensuring all students receive an appropriate education.
“It’s a niche field of law that’s very necessary but also very set on the ground. It’s very hard for those individuals to access those rights,” Breen said.
Chevrier also said the challenges of the case demonstrated the need for greater legal resources for parents trying to defend their children with disabilities.
She will be spearheading free legal clinics in juvenile detention centers and homeless shelters in the coming year to help combat this challenge.
“Endrew’s parents were really champions and they fought for long and were able to put forward so much of their own time and resources into getting what they needed for their child. Not everybody has that opportunity,” Chevrier said. “Systems need to be put in place that make education law more accessible for those who do not have the means to fight for their children.”
Chevrier was a special education teacher before studying at GULC, and focused most of her law school career on education law, which she said granted her the firsthand experience necessary throughout the case.
“I had intended to remain a special education teacher and I never wanted to become a lawyer when I realized that the kids who I was teaching didn’t have access to rights they were entitled to under the IDEA,” Chevrier said.
The GULC Clinic also afforded Deffebach and Breen the opportunity to work on the case, in part because of their focus on appellate litigation.
While Chevrier focused mostly on legal research, Deffebach and Breen were responsible for telling Endrew’s story.
“We got to go really in-depth into reading the documents and the records and painting a picture of who Endrew is and how the case got here,” Deffebach said.
Wolfman said he was highly impressed with his students’ work throughout the case.
“It was an enormous privilege to work on this case and the fact that Endrew’s parents put their trust in us both in the clinical students at Stanford and the clinical students here at Georgetown is an enormous honor,” Wolfman said. “It was an honor to work on this case and to work with students so capable and dedicated.”

Georgetown Right to Life began its annual Life Week yesterday to raise awareness for issues concerning human life from conception to natural death through service projects and speaker events.
The planned events include a talk on the future of anti-abortion legislation and court cases and a diaper drive and bake sale to benefit the Northwest Center, a pregnancy resource center that serves the Washington, D.C. area founded by Georgetown alumni.
Mary Forr, director of the Department of Life Issues of the Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, is slated to speak Wednesday night to offer anti-abortion perspective on disability.
Right to Life Vice President MyLan Metzger (COL ’19) said she is particularly excited for this event, as it highlights a number of issues that Right to Life is concerned about besides abortion issues.
“I am excited for this event because it ties together a lot of complicated issues and discusses what we can do to serve people in need. This event is also important to me because that the Archdiocese highlights the dignity of all human life in a special way,” Metzger wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It frames abortion, the death penalty, and euthanasia as a human dignity issue, not just a political issue.”
While many of the events and speakers change from year to year, certain aspects of the week have remained the same since it was started. According to Right to Life President Amelia Irvine (COL ’19), one annual component of Life Week is Flag Day. Planned for Thursday, the event involves placing 3,562 small flags on Copley Lawn to represent the average number of abortions performed each day in the United States.
Today at 7 p.m., Right to Life will be screening the documentary “Hush,” a film that explores the relationship between abortion procedures and breast cancer.
H*yas for Choice released a statement condemning the planned screening of “Hush,” specifically due to its promotion of the claim that abortion increases the risk for breast cancer.
“Although all of Georgetown Right to Life’s Life Week events are appalling, the screening of the documentary, HUSH, is especially concerning in its direct opposition to proven medical science and facts,” the statement reads. “By hosting a screening of HUSH, Right to Life endorses non-scientific, factually inaccurate health information. Lying and promoting false information is not a Jesuit or Catholic value and Right to Life should be ashamed.”
Life Week comes on the heels of Choice Week, held by H*yas for Choice last week. Irvine said this timing was not planned. However, Metzger said the timing provides an opportunity for continued dialogue on campus.
Metzger, who attended some of the Choice Week events last week, said she hopes that a diverse group of Georgetown’s community will participate in the Life Week events and continue to foster a dialogue on campus.
“I felt like it was necessary to learn from the other side, and because I wanted to represent my opinions and beliefs in these discussions,” Metzger wrote. “I hope that some members of H*yas for Choice will attend our events, either to learn or even to push back against some of our ideas. I believe that this type of cooperation is important for either side to be successful and to promote civil discourse on campus.”

GOD’S BLESSINGS TO GEORGETOWN’S RIGHT TO LIFE, AND ALL ITS FAITHFUL MEMBERS, WORKERS, & SUPPORTERS! 
“The truth is not concerned with how many it persuades.”
The right to Life is what a Catholic University should support, teach, and reinforce always!  Catholic Universities need to pursue the truth, & build solid foundations in faith and morals for all students, based on the infallible teachings of Jesus Christ, His written Word (Bible), & the Catholic Church He founded.  
The Jesuits. administrators, & faculty at GU (and other Catholic universities) have fallen far short of this, and someday will need to give an account to God of their actions & behavior!  The Bible and the Church warn against giving scandal (in the Catholic sense), and causing others to sin grievously.  
Regardless of religious affiliation, a Catholic university’s purpose is the pursuit of truth as found in the natural moral law, and the objective, enlightened, divine law of God.
GU’s failure to do this goes back to the unethical & immoral Land ‘O Lakes Conference in 1967, the Sexual Revolution of the late 1960’s, and  attachment to earthly pleasures, possessions, political correctness, and human pride/prestige, instead of informing young consciences of being faithful and obedient to God, His Commandments, & His Church.
The H*yas for Choice statement above is offensive, hypocritical, and false.  Medical science has proven clearly that human life begins at conception.  Ever heard of human DNA, the building blocks of life?  Or, embryonic cells coming from two humans being human (ask any moral embryologist)?   
The Bible speaks of God knowing and knitting man (in His image) in the womb.  St. John Paul II once said that even if there were any doubt, one needs to always err on the side of human dignity. 
But there is no doubt that abortion kills babies, and harms women physically and psychologically.  For those who say to “judge not”, I’ve attached an article from Catholic Answers below.  
“To one who has faith, no explanation is necessary.  To one without faith, no explanation is possible.”  St. Thomas Aquinas

Having an abortion does indeed raise a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer. There are many studies that support this fact. In laymen’s terms the reason is that during pregnancy, breast tissue undergoes hormonal changes in preparation for lactation but the abrupt disruption of these natural changes due to abortion leaves the breast tissue in a state of vulnerability whereby cells can more easily become cancerous. A spontaneous abortion (natural) does not have this same risk because there are other hormones associated with the natural miscarriage that more gradually act on the breast tissue cell changes.

Sounds like H*yas for Choice is anti-Science.

The results of a collaborative study between the Children’s National Health System and a researcher at the Georgetown University Medical Center, focused on evaluating the effectiveness of an initiative on autism in the children’s show Sesame Street, will be released Wednesday.
Bruno Anthony, the deputy director of the Georgetown Center for Child and Human Development, worked on a study to assess the effectiveness of Sesame Workshop’s initiative Sesame Street and Autism: See Amazing in All Children.
Sesame Workshop is the nonprofit organization that manages the show Sesame Street on Public Broadcasting Service and Home Box Office.
The results of the study may underscore the project’s implications for autism education and awareness.
The initiative follows Julia, a Muppet with autism, and includes online videos, mobile apps, storybooks and daily routine cards surrounding her experiences.
Developed with the help of over 250 experts in the autism advocacy community, including people with autism, See Amazing seeks to celebrate the unique perspectives of each child according to the initiative’s website.
The resources are geared towards children between the ages of two and five.
The study surveyed over 1,000 families, more than one third of whom include children with autism, through three online surveys relating to the effectiveness of the Sesame Street program in building children’s understanding of and engagement with autism.
Sesame Workshop Executive Vice President of Global Impact and Philanthropy Sherrie Westin said the program is experiencing success so far in connecting with the autism community.
Westin said she hopes the show’s addition will continue to promote awareness and understanding of autism.
“The response from the autism community to “See Amazing in all Children” has been extraordinary, and we are committed to continuing our efforts to promote understanding and acceptance of autism, as part of our mission of helping all children grow smarter, stronger, and kinder,” Westin wrote in a March 20 press release.
Jeanette Betancourt, the senior vice president for community and family engagement at Sesame Workshop, said the decision to create Julia’s character came from families with children with autism requesting Sesame Street raise awareness about autism.
“For years, families of children with autism have asked us to address the issue. We heard a call to use our expertise and characters to build a bridge between the autism and neurotypical communities,” Betancourt wrote in a March 20 press release. “So many partners, advisors, and organizations have contributed to the success of this initiative, and we are thrilled to have the benefit of this collaboration as we launch this latest chapter.”
Westin said Julia’s character was crafted to apply to the broadest range of children with autism as possible, with Sesame Street creators consulting with 14 different autism groups in researching for the characters.
Julia, introduced online in 2015, will make her television debut April 10 in the Sesame Street special “Meet Julia.” She will appear first in English and Spanish in the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom and Mexico and will appear later in the year in other languages across the world.
