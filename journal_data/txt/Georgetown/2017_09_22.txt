Opportunities for women in the legal field have improved drastically over the past 50 years, said Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the Georgetown University Law Center on Wednesday afternoon.
Ginsburg, speaking to first-year students at GULC, said the industry has seen a monumental shift toward gender equity in recent years, but that certain underlying issues still pervade.
“When I graduated from law school, there was no anti-discrimination law, there wasn’t even an equal pay act and employers were entirely up front about wanting no lady lawyers. Sign-up sheets for interviews for summer jobs or permanent associates on graduation often said ‘men only,’” Ginsburg said. “I don’t know how many times I heard from potential employers ‘oh we had a woman once at this shop and she was dreadful.’”
The discussion, moderated by GULC Dean William Treanor, covered a broad range of subjects, including the changing role of women in the field and the most notable cases the court has seen in recent sessions.
The second female to receive an appointment to the Supreme Court, Ginsburg praised the fact that the current first-year class of GULC students is majority female — something unheard of in Ginsburg’s time as a student.
“The contrast is gigantic. My entering class at Harvard included over 500 students. Nine of us were women. So we were strange, a curiosity,” Ginsburg said. “To look at a class like this is exhilarating.”
Ginsburg said she credits the anti-discrimination and employment laws in the 1960s for opening the doors of the legal professional world to women. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, for example, included a ban on gender discrimination. Ginsburg recalled a large lawsuit against a dozen top law firms in New York that were found guilty of discriminating against female applicants as a striking example of the shift.
A professor at Columbia Law School at the time, Ginsburg was privy to the early details of the case.
“The women at NYU and Columbia had this collaboration with their favorite male students and they asked the male students, ‘When you interviewed someone for a summer or a permanent job, ask them in their interviews: Level with me, what do you really think of woman lawyers?’” Ginsburg said. “And that’s the basis on which they got the 12 defendants.”
Ginsburg also credits both national and global feminist movements with not only her own success but also the growing number of women in the legal field.
“How did I decide to become a flaming feminist litigator?” Ginsburg said. “I was riding a wave, and was fantastically lucky that in the ’70s the women’s movement was coming alive all over the world.”
Ginsburg said much work remains to be done to achieve full equality in the legal workforce despite the advances that women have made in law over the years.
“There’s the question of having family life and a work life, and having a balance between those two. I’m always sad to hear people say that to climb to the top of the tree … a woman has to forgo her marriage and children,” Ginsburg said.
Ginsburg also devoted a significant portion of her speech to analyzing the cases from last term, systematically reviewing the court’s most contentious decisions.
Only nine cases of the 62 decisions released last term were categorized as a “sharp disagreement,” with the justices split between 5 and 3, or 5 and 4, after the appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch, according to Ginsburg. She also noted that the court reached unanimous decisions in at least 31 of the cases.
“Agreement is substantially higher than sharp disagreement on the court,” Ginsburg said.
Ginsburg said a little-publicized case resonated with her the most — Maslenjuk v. United States, which posed the question, “Couldn’t a naturalized citizen be stripped of her citizenship if she committed an offense and failed to report it on her citizenship application?”
Chief Justice John Roberts was visibly shaken by this question, according to Ginsburg.
“Some time ago, [Roberts] confessed, of course, outside the statute of limitations, he drove 60 miles an hour in a 55. So, would such a confession prompt cancellation of naturalization?” Ginsburg said. “Justice Kagan said ‘I can’t recall how many times I have lied about my weight.’ The council comfortingly responded, unless they did so under oath.”
The next court term will begin on the first Monday in October. While Ginsburg looks forward to court resuming session, she was hesitant to make any definitive claims for the future.
“There’s only one prediction for the upcoming term, and that’s that it will be momentous,” Ginsburg said.

Former acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates will serve as a distinguished lecturer at the Georgetown University Law Center in government during the 2017 fall semester, according to a GULC press release Sep. 21.
“Sally Yates is an extraordinary public servant who has had a career of the greatest consequence,” GULC Dean William M. Treanor wrote in the press release. “It is a privilege to have her join our faculty this fall.”
According to the press release, Yates will be working with faculty to lecture and advise students at the Law Center. In the press release, Yates expressed her excitement to take on the position.
“Georgetown has a long and distinguished history of rigorous and thoughtful academic dialogue and a commitment to social justice. I look forward to being a part of this dynamic environment and interacting with their outstanding students and faculty,” Yates said.
Yates was confirmed as Deputy Attorney General in May 2015, nominated by former President Barack Obama. Yates gained national attention after refusing to enforce President Donald Trump’s executive order banning entry to travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries on Jan. 27.
Before serving as deputy U.S. attorney general, Yates worked at the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia and was the lead prosecutor in the case against the Centennial Olympic Park bomber, Eric Rudolf.
Trump’s immigration measure initially barred visa and green card-holders from entering the United States and prompted protests across the country, including on Georgetown University’s campus. The University submitted an amicus brief arguing against the immigration ban and provided free immigration consultations for those affected on campus by Trump’s ban.
The executive order was halted by federal judges after several states and organizations took legal action against the Trump administration. The Supreme Court reinstated some aspects of the executive order on June 26 and has agreed to review the case later in October of this year.
Yates did not find the ban to be in accordance with the mission of the Justice Department and was therefore terminated from her position, which would later be filled by current Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
Yates is not the first person associated with the GULC to oppose Trump’s immigration ban. Senior United States District Court Judge James Robart (LAW ’73) suspended the ban a week after it was issued on Feb. 3.
On May 8, Yates and former United States Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified in front of the Senate Judiciary’s Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism on Russian interference in the 2016 election. Yates testified on her efforts to warn the Trump administration about then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn’s dealings with Russian officials.
Almost a year after being fired from Trump’s administration, Sally Yates will be joining the Law Center as part of the Distinguished Visitors from Government program, which brings former officials who were recently active in public service to teach students.
Yates will also deliver GULC’s annual Philip A. Hart Memorial Lecture, named after a U.S Senator and Georgetown alumnus.

Why “sacked”?  She was removed for sticking to her principles and serving the country the way she felt was required. Sacked has negative connotations.

She was a political appointee and Obama administration holdover who should have resigned Obama’s last day b/c that’s what appointees do, but was allowed to stay.  Once she publicly stated she would refuse to enforce the law she was fired for cause.  
The acting attorney general and all government officials have a responsibility to follow the laws of this nation, especially if they’re in the Department of Justice.  If they can’t do that they should resign, or be removed, as happened to Yates.  
Question: Why should anyone respect the law or the courts system if we have people like Yates ignoring or violating the law because they don’t like it?   And now that Republicans are in office why shouldn’t they behave like Yates and just say screw the rule of law, we’re going to behave like Yates and the Democrats?  The country depends on following the law, regardless of which party is in power.  But for some reason, only the Republicans follow this rule, as is evident by the strong Democrat support for illegal immigration.

Georgetown University joined 30 other U.S. universities on an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court calling for the invalidation of President Donald Trump’s second executive order restricting travel from six predominantly Muslim countries.
The Sept. 18 amicus brief is the second signed by Georgetown that relates to the Jan. 27 order. Georgetown previously filed a brief to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on Apr. 20. The court ruled in May to keep the travel ban on hold after refugee rights organizations and others argued it was discriminatory and unconstitutional.
Taking all considerations into account, the brief called on the Supreme Court to strike down the executive order.
“The Order falls far short of justifying its ban on individuals from the specified countries,” the brief concluded. “Even in its more limited form, the Order harms American colleges and universities and should be invalidated.”
However, on June 26 the Supreme Court upheld some of the executive order’s restrictions while granting entry to people with “bona fide personal relationships” to U.S. residents, and will begin to hear arguments again beginning on Oct. 10.
Under the status of amici — a group that is invested in the case but is not a party to it — the institutions condemned the order, saying that international students, faculty and scholars make vital contributions to their campuses, to the United States and to the world.
“American colleges and universities have long recognized the importance of attracting international students, faculty, staff, and scholars,” the brief read. “Their work leads to critical advancements across all disciplines, from science and technology to arts and letters, often through cross-border collaborations that enhance their teaching and research.”
By using their educations to benefit foreign countries and communities, international students have contributed to growth across the world, the brief argued.
“International students study here and return home as leaders in business, medicine, politics, and other fields. The benefits of international diversity in American higher education thus inure not only to colleges and universities themselves, but to the country and indeed the world as a whole.”
Throughout the brief, the group further made the case that the executive order undercut their outreach efforts and their institutional values.
“The Order directly threatens amici’s ability to attract persons not only from the six specified countries, but from around the world,” the brief read. “The Order contradicts the values that American colleges and universities have traditionally touted as benefits of studying and working here, including the freedom of religion and equality embodied in the First and Fourteenth Amendments.”
Referring to Georgetown in particular, the brief appealed to the university’s Jesuit identity and values while affirming its commitment to diversity.
“Since its founding, Georgetown University has been a global community, engaged in training future generations of global
citizens to lead and make a difference in the world, and is made stronger by religious, cultural and international diversity,” the brief read.
The brief highlighted the university’s alumni, including Prime Minister of Lebanon Saad Hariri (MSB ’92) and former Deputy Prime Minister of Jordan Nasser Judeh (SFS ’83), to further the case for accepting international students who would move on to become leaders and major contributors to the world.
The 30 schools argued that they have already been adversely affected by the order, saying some international students turned down their offers of admission out of concern for their safety.
They argued that loosening the ban by permitting entry to people with personal connections inside the United States was too vague a remedy to sufficiently compensate for the proposed legislation’s damages.
“This line has not resolved the uncertainty the Order injected into amici’s engagement with international students, faculty, and scholars, who are left to wonder at what point their relationship with amici becomes ‘bona fide,’” the brief read.
University President John J. DeGioia made Georgetown’s position towards the order clear Jan. 29, when President Trump had released the first version of the executive order. DeGioia said Georgetown aimed to provide a space where people from all backgrounds could engage with each other freely.
“We are an institution that values the contributions of our international students, staff and faculty, and we are deeply committed to interreligious dialogue and providing a context in which members of all faith backgrounds are welcomed and encouraged to practice their faith,” DeGioia said.

Despite living in a “more fractious” world, students looking for a career in diplomacy should continue to pursue their dreams, said Ambassador Nancy McEldowney, the new director for the Masters in Foreign Service program, in an exclusive interview with The Hoya.
Before beginning her term at Georgetown this fall, McEldowney served as director of the Foreign Service Institute at the Department of State, where she oversaw the government’s diplomatic training program. She was one of several officials who left the State Department following policy and leadership decisions she said would “make America weaker.”
The Hoya interviewed McEldowney about the state of the foreign service, her goals for the MSFS program, and the future of diplomacy.
Let’s start with a question that a lot of students get asked at the start of the year: Why SFS? 
For me, the answer to that question is two parts: I am in SFS because I believe in international service. People of conscience need to act to help the world and the people in it. I have spent many years trying to support the next generation of global leaders as part of my public service, so this is a continuation of that personal passion.
But I also want to ask a question that you didn’t ask which is, “Why Georgetown?” I wanted to be in SFS but I also wanted to be at Georgetown because I believe that this is a place with values, a place with conscience. This isn’t just a place where you get an education, it’s where you develop your own worldview. Now more than ever do we need institutions like this one that are going to stand for truth, integrity and compassion, and that was the combination that was irresistible.
What do you think is the role of a program like MSFS in today’s political environment? 
There are some enduring qualities about this program: to give people the grounding they need in both theory and practice of international relations [and] to give them specific skills sets in one of our concentration areas — whether it’s business and finance or development or national security.
But there’s an added element now. We are seeing a resurgence of certain things that have been present always in this country and elsewhere, but they are coming out in unexpected ways: racism, misogyny, Islamophobia, xenophobia. We need to position our students to navigate through a world of nationalism and populism where the institutions that governed the post-World War II era are eroding away. Our students need the intellectual agility and the personal confidence to cope and navigate through with some clarity.
What are some of the most significant developments or changes in the foreign service that you have seen in your career? 
I was in graduate school in the late ‘80s and entered the U.S. government when the Cold War was coming to an end … There was great optimism about the fact that we had successfully managed this momentous competition. Few expected the period of chaos and conflict that ensued, and there is a great line that I think is apt here, which is: “fewer dragons, a lot more snakes.” We didn’t have the kind of potential for nuclear cataclysm between the United States and the Soviet Union, but we had asymmetrical conflicts that caused people to go, “Wait a minute. We misunderstood.”
What you see is that actually the world has become more fractious and more fragmented. Many people thought globalization would lead to a sense of global identity, but those who feel disenfranchised and dispossessed as a result of globalization — whether that’s economic social or religious — they’ve actually become more provincial, more parochial, more vested in their localized identity. The institutions have lost credibility and when you see traditional leaders like the United States undergoing their own internal upheaval, people from the German leader to the Canadian leader are all saying, “we need to chart our own path.”
What are some aspects of your experience with diplomacy training that you hope to bring to MSFS? 
I start with a sense of humility and an honor to be here. I am so humbled by the great things that are happening here. I’ve met students and faculty and staff who are truly world class. I have no negative judgments at all, only positive ones to share about the program.
I will share with you a couple of thoughts that I bring with me in terms of general orientation. We are getting people ready to take on not just a job but a lifetime of jobs in global service. We have to think both about the academics but also the skill sets.
I’ll start with the capacity to undertake critical analysis — to understand the biases, both the cognitive biases [and] the unconscious interpersonal biases that each individual inevitably brings to something; but then to be able to look at a problem a phenomenon, and understand the unintended consequences to any action or decision, to recognize history [and] theory applied.
Also, [we have] to make sure that we’re interdisciplinary. It’s one thing to talk about global warming from a scientific perspective, but what about from an anthropological one? How do social relations affect people’s interpretation of or behavior toward a particular issue? What are the narratives, the unwritten social narratives that drive an entire society to make decisions, to act in a certain way?
We also need to look harder at our methodology. The old style of “sage on a stage,” where a learned professor gives a lecture is great for some things, but we need experiential learning, peer-to-peer learning that gets at [students’] needs.
We are training global leaders and they need to have been exposed to leadership theory, but also practice, so that they are able to articulate and to act in the world. I was talking just this morning about creating a module on leadership, incorporating it into the orientation on the very first days of the class and having clinics each semester so that people are able to explore different aspects from communication to problem-solving to building cohesive teams.
How do you hope to allocate limited resources for different student populations with distinct career tracks? 
I am very passionate about and deeply committed to advancing diversity through my leadership. I want to have as many international students as well as people of different races, different sexual orientations [in] students, staff, and faculty so that we are truly representing the totality of what humanity. [We should create] an environment that doesn’t just say, “we’ve let you in the door,” but says “we want you here and we are committed to your success and we are going to cultivate you.”
I have seen over and over again that the best substantive results, programmatic results, academic results come about from creating that kind of environment. As events like [the protests in] Charlottesville[, Va.] happen, as we hear statements coming from senior leaders that convey disrespect for women and ethnic minorities, I redouble my efforts to make sure that this place is a role model for others.
But the other part of your question was about career choices and what we do with the curriculum to set our students up for success. This program gives people [a] foundation, and then it gives them the beginning of a specialization. On the foundational part, I’ve started asking myself the question, are there gaps in what we’re doing? Are there areas that we should be thinking about, like strategic forecasting? Must well educated people with a graduate degree today know about design thinking and systems thinking and big data and how to analyze big data?
We don’t have the concentration on science and technology. It strikes me that if you want to be a global leader you’re going to have to know about issues like global warming, global health, pandemics from avian influenza to Ebola. You’re going to have to know about … technological advances in transportation to manufacturing and agriculture. We want to prepare people for an immediate job, but we want to give them that breadth and depth that will allow them to move in multiple directions and still weave into a coherent journey.
In a July 28 New York Times column, you were quoted calling the State Department a “toxic, troubled environment.” When and why did that opinion continue begin to change? 
Let me begin by saying: Public service is an incredibly noble profession. I want as many people as possible to go into public service … It is hugely important for the world. It has a tremendous positive impact on the individual lives of the people who are doing the public service and those who are benefiting from it.
I made the decision to leave the Department of State, because I was troubled by what I feared was a negative and divisive approach by the new president. I had many colleagues express concern about the rhetoric during the campaign, initial policy decisions, the role that America had traditionally played in the world as a force for good. If it’s zero sum, and I’m going to deny everything from you, you’re going to walk away resentful. I might be able to dominate you in the debate for one day, but you won’t trust me or be my friend unless I am also acknowledging the legitimacy of your concerns.
On top of my concern about the policy line, we had a combination of management decisions — about a one-third budget cut, hiring freezes, transfer freezes, the cutoff of recruitment programs designed to enhance diversity inside the State Department — that we knew, over time, wasn’t a bureaucratic or turf protection issue. The decisions that are going to be taken today are going to undermine America’s capacity to operate effectively. Ultimately it was going to make America weaker and make the world more dangerous.
Finally, there was an issue which is so so important. That’s trust. Trust makes the difference in everything. If you trust your leader, you will follow your leader into incredibly difficult circumstances, you will make sacrifices for your leader, you will take risks because you know your leader has your back. The trust inside the State Department was diminished and damaged, and without that it’s very hard to go on.
What would you say to a student who is debating committing to a career track and working for the State Department?
I would say ‘go for it,’ and here’s why: No one can predict the future. The future is always uncertain. Everything changes, including administrations. In that context, the decision that people have to make for themselves is: What is the job pathway that will be most rewarding?
Even though I chose public service, I have enormous respect for those who make other choices. Civil society and large corporations that now have major philanthropic arms are effecting positive change in the world. It’s not one and done. If you choose to go into government in three years, then you can make another choice and go into the private sector and go back and forth. So I would urge people to be optimistic always because they hold the power of choice in their hands. We have our own agency to determine the path that we want to take and we can make things come out right.
Where do you see the future of diplomacy going?
Diplomacy is enormously important. It is a profession that has been built over many years with a lot of tradition and orthodoxy associated with it and in some respects has been resistant to change. It must change and adapt and modernize if it’s going to help us solve the world’s problems. I think is the very large challenge for diplomats, … to be open to completely unorthodox solutions, because they’re going to come at us anyway.
It’s easy, when looking around the world right now, to be daunted by the challenges. And there are challenges, to be sure. But there are also tremendous opportunities. Poverty is down, the middle class is growing, more people have access to education and health care and the internet. We could end many diseases, we can significantly eliminate poverty, if we do it right. So what I would say to the students all across Georgetown, is they should be excited about what lies ahead and optimistic about the fact that they can shape the future. We need them to.
This interview has been edited and condensed.

International students seeking employment opportunities criticized the Cawley Career Education Center’s Sept. 15 Career Fair for a perceived lack of employers that sponsored work visas for students interested in working in the United States after graduation.
Of the 103 companies listed on the Career Center’s website participating in the event, 38 claimed to offer visa sponsorships, 23 reportedly accepted candidates who possessed a valid student visa and the remaining 52 required proof of permanent work authorization from international applicants.
But upon arriving at the fair, international students realized that the list was inaccurate. Some companies that apparently sponsored work visas denied that they did so, while others that indicated they did not claimed otherwise.
Ingrid Glitz (SFS ’18), an international student from Brazil who is leading a crowdsourcing effort to petition additional information and resources for international students, said she was frustrated by the confusing information and the inconveniences international students had to go through to find out which employers might support them.
“When we got there, some of the companies were mad, actually. Some said they didn’t but they did, and some of the companies said that they did sponsor visas but they didn’t,” Glitz said. “So, the list was not completely correct.”
Glitz recounted her experiences and outlined her concerns and suggestions the next day through a post in a Georgetown Class of 2018 Facebook group. She also wrote that she wanted the support of other international students in presenting a letter to the university highlighting these issues and suggested improvements.
“Together with a group of other international students on campus, I want to write an official letter to the school complaining about the lack of support for students on an F-1 visa and suggesting some measures that they should take to help us out more when it comes to finding jobs,” Glitz wrote in the Facebook post.
As of press time, 191 students, both American and international, had signed onto the letter.
To work in the United States, international students with valid student visas but without permanent work authorization must first obtain an extension to their stay in the United States before they secure a job with an employer who sponsors their work visa by representing them in the application process.
Still, even international students who already possess permanent work authorization may only seek employment with companies that accept their permit.
Cawley Center Executive Director Mike Schaub said the Career Center had anticipated the companies attending the fair would be transparent about their work visa policies.
“It is our expectation that that employers who indicate that they hire international students actually communicate this fact during the fair,” Schaub wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Glitz said some recruiters were not even aware if their companies sponsored visas.
“International students were basically going from one booth to another and having to wait in line for 20 minutes and then just start with a question that is not the most sympathetic question ever, just like, ‘Are you going to sponsor me?’ Glitz said.
Schaub acknowledged the difficulties that international students face when searching for jobs and called for a more coordinated response from the university and recruiters alike.
“We understand the unique challenges experienced by international students who are engaged in the job search process,” Schaub wrote. “There is a need for intentional efforts across the university to assist students, and for recruiters to be more informed about employing students with visas.”
Though Glitz did not attribute any responsibility to the Career Center for the low number of visa-sponsoring employers in attendance, she said hiring an adviser that worked directly with international students could help international students better navigate an at-times complex process.
“The immigration system is not helpful. I just think that the Cawley Career Center could be doing a better job,” Glitz said.
“They should have a person specific for international students, at least one person, like they have one person specific for law school. Because I think that we have a very specific scenario that they should be aware of.”
The Career Center offers resources to support international students, including workshops for networking and interviewing and digital platform PassportCareer for job searching, according to Schaub.
“The Cawley Career Education Center sees first hand the incredible talent represented by our international students through our daily interactions with these students,” Schaub wrote. “We want to make sure that employers recognize this talent pool and are informed about navigating the hiring process for students with visas.”
Glitz said finding employment as an international student is a struggle few others understand.
“It’s very frustrating that no one knows how hard it is to get a job here as a foreigner,” Glitz said. “People just assume because the U.S. is the ‘country of immigrants’ that it is going to be so easy for all of us to get a job here.”

Three student projects have received funding from community donationts through SaxaFund, a student-alumni collaboration launched in the spring.
SaxaFund was launched in March 2017 by a coalition of Georgetown University alumni, the Georgetown University Student Association and Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union and Students of Georgetown, Inc. CEOs to serve as a crowdfunding tool for student initiatives and products.
Projects appealing for donations through SaxaFund are raising money successfully, according to GUSA President Kamar Mack (COL ’19). Successfully funded projects include a student film and a service for building credit history.
The fund’s financial support comes primarily from alumni donations, and three alumni are members of its board, broadening SaxaFund’s reach to potential donors willing to support student initiatives.
“We have alumni sit on the board of the SaxaFund; it’s a partnership between current students and alumni themselves,” Mack said.
One of the first endeavors SaxaFund promoted was an initiative to fund portable field lights for club sports teams after the closure of Kehoe Field. The field was closed in February 2016 after university administrators and club sports teams using the field raised safety concerns about uneven playing surfaces, exposed concrete and large sections of torn-up artificial turf.
The closure left club sports teams without an on-campus playing location, forcing them to practice on off-campus fields, which often lacked lights for nighttime practices. This proceeded until a SaxaFund grant helped fund the portable lights.
GUSA Athletics Policy Chair Daniel Fain (COL ‘18) said using SaxaFund to raise money for portable lights has allowed the various club sports teams to continue in a relatively stable manner.
“While the lights are not a permanent solution to the problem of field space, they are vital to the growth and well-being of the club sports community,” Fain said. “SaxaFund offered the opportunity for the Georgetown community to acknowledge this need and come together in support.”
Fain said that without the help of SaxaFund, raising money for the lights would have been very challenging.
“Without SaxaFund, we would likely have hoped for a single large donation, which would have been unlikely,” Fain said.
Each of the three student-run organizations involved manage a different aspect of SaxaFund: GUASFCU handles the finances, The Corp is involved in the business and marketing side, while GUSA provides institutional support.
“It really stemmed from a sense that a quick, flexible funding source is very helpful. And it is very much student-run and student owned. And I think one of the things that makes Georgetown great is that students take an entrepreneurial initiative and SaxaFund really filled that need as something run by The Corp, GUSA and GUASFCU. And we all kind of support each other and play a role,” Mack said.
Former GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and Vice President Chris Fisk (COL ’17) pushed forward the launch of SaxaFund last year, according to current GUSA Vice President Jessica Andino (COL ’18). This year, Garrett Williams (COL ’18) is one of the principle GUSA members involved in the initiative.
However, with regards to exposure to student groups who need donations from SaxaFund, both Mack and Fain believe there is more that can be done.
“I hope that awareness of SaxaFund continues to increase among the entire Georgetown community,” Fain said.

Tensions between the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority and the largest labor union representing Metro employees tipped over twice this week amid labor contract negotiations, prompting service meltdowns across the rail system and delaying transit operations for hours on end.
Following the discovery of a mechanical hazard that dealt an employee an electrical shock during inspections of WMATA’s new 7000-series railcar last Saturday, the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 689 issued an urgent stand-down safety order for employees Thursday. This was done as a preventative measure until Metro engineers could ensure each railcar was safe for inspectors to work on.
The measure forced Metro leadership to pull hundreds of rail cars from the six-line system and shortened the length of trains to six-car arrangements during the morning rush hour. Service cuts extended into Thursday afternoon.
Metro announced it completed a review of ATU Local 689’s safety concerns at noon, saying its inspection procedures were appropriate and consistent with guidelines set by the railcar manufacturer; they continued inspections into the afternoon.
Metro Chief Safety Officer Patrick Lavin said Metro values safety over service, despite the inconveniences the employee stand-down caused commuters on the Red Line.
“Part of creating a safety culture means taking immediate action to address concerns raised by employees. If a concern cannot be immediately resolved or requires further investigation, sometimes additional steps—such as a safety stand-down—must be taken in an abundance of caution,” Lavin wrote in a statement. “We encourage the reporting of safety concerns, and thank our customers for their understanding as we place safety first.”
Meanwhile on Monday, thousands of Orange line commuters experienced delays as Metro single-tracked service, using only the line’s outbound track from New Carrollton to Cheverly, Md.
The decision to reduce service came after a construction delay Sunday night overran into the Monday morning commute. A mobile concrete mixer broke down during repairs of the Orange line on Sunday, prompting Metro to ask workers to mix concrete by hand and carry construction materials using wheelbarrows.
Still, though Metro leadership blamed its own equipment, ATU Local 689 countered with allegations of planning failures on WMATA’s part and blamed the construction delays on private contractors’ “shoddy” work.
“Metro could have avoided this morning’s delay if they had properly planned for the project and had Metro workers, who understand the work and system, complete it the first time,” the union wrote in a press release. “Here are many instances where contractors do shoddy work and Metro workers have to come back to correct their mistakes; today was one of those instances.”
Earlier this month, Metro announced their self-assessed improvements, stating that they were “showing signs of getting ‘back to good,’” a reference to WMATA’s ongoing “Back to Good” campaign to improve service and reliability. Most recently, WMATA completed its SafeTrack initiatives to improve infrastructure along Metro’s most used rail lines.
WMATA General Manager and CEO Paul J. Wiedefeld said Metro customers have seen fewer train offloads, better on-time performance and fewer unscheduled delays as a result of new railcars and improved maintenance programs.
“Our customers will determine when we are ultimately back to good, but I am confident we are on the way,” said Wiedefeld wrote in a Sept. 11 statement. “I am very proud of the thousands of Metro employees who are working day and night to improve safety and service for our customers.”
Despite these claims, WMATA is engaged in a back-and-forth discussion with ATU Local 689 over safety guarantees for employees, the role of private contractors in the second phase of construction of the Silver line extension to Washington Dulles International Airport and the cost of retirement benefits, wages, healthcare and pensions.
A three-member arbitration panel will now monitor negotiations between the two entities.

The only reason we have on time trains is because we have more time added on to our running time schedules. Also there’s car mechanic on the line to fix minor problems we may have when operating on mainline but its is still unsafe to employees to operate in our cab area because we can’t close our doors where we operate becasuse of smell of bodily fluids, food and condoms in the area we operate from. Its STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOP) TO LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN. We get sick from all that exposure so it’s still not safe for the operators. It’s all for the public and it’s to hell for the operators.

Georgetown University has partnered with Origis Energy USA to build a solar power system off campus that could provide nearly 50 percent of the campus’s electricity by the 2019-20 academic year.
The agreement, announced Monday, aligns with the university’s goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Origis will install 105,000 solar panels on a 518-acre property in La Plata, Md. The panels will be owned and operated by Origis and produce 75,000 megawatt hours of power each year, according to a company press release.
Construction is slated to start in January 2019 after the company completes research and permitting. The system is expected to be fully operational by June of that same year.
The deal involves no up-front costs to Georgetown and is expected to generate significant electricity cost savings in the long term, according to Vice President of Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey.
Morey said the agreement would allow the university to meet its ambitious green goals.
“The initiative helps fulfill Georgetown University’s sustainability mission, including the University’s commitment to reduce its carbon footprint 50 percent by the year 2020 – a goal which we met in 2014 by purchasing 100 percent Renewable Energy Certificates and now strive to meet through new investments in energy efficiency, conservation and new renewable power projects,” Morey wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Johan Vanhee, business development managing director at Origis Energy, said the university made a wise choice in selecting solar energy as a renewable alternative.
“I think we are currently the most cost-efficient energy source there is in the U.S. markets,” Vanhee said. “Because of economies of scale we are able to offer energy prices to the customer, utilities, universities, commercial and industrial customers, that are the most cost-effective in the current energy market.”
Georgetown University Student Association Deputy Chief of Staff Zachary Schroepfer (MSB ’19), who has previously advocated on behalf for sustainability on campus, said the agreement reflected an increased commitment on behalf of the administration to sustainability.
“GUSA definitely views sustainability as a priority. With a policy team dedicated to sustainability issues to focus on making our school more environmentally friendly, we as an organization want to advocate for a more sustainable campus for our student body,” Schroepfer wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Origis deal builds on the university’s smaller, on-campus solar panel projects, Schroepfer said.
“We found out earlier that they would be renewing the solar panels on the [Intercultural Center] and adding additional ones around campus; however, these weren’t to be used to power our school, but to be sold back to the [Washington,] D.C. power grid,” Schroepfer wrote. “However, this new announcement shows the university’s commitment to a more sustainable footprint.”
Vanhee said Georgetown’s status as a leading university greatly motivated Origis to pursue a partnership.
“It is clear that any party in the solar space is very interested in working together with an icon in the academic world such as Georgetown University,” Vanhee said. “I think Georgetown University has an absolute leadership role and many universities will follow the example of Georgetown University.”

Your picture is a little misleading. Unfortunately at this time the university is not updating the solar panel system on the ICC nor adding solar panels to major buildings on the campus proper. Let’s hope they will

I am glad to see that not only in homes or countries or even companies but also universities and many more are contributing to the solar energy revolution, I think it is great to look out for what we already have plenty of like the sun.

The growing and highly educated population of Washington, D.C., makes it the perfect metropolitan area for Amazon to build a second headquarters, Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) announced Sept. 14 while launching the District’s bid.
Bowser officially announced D.C.’s bid though a video titled “Obviously, Washington, D.C.” In the video, Bowser discusses why the District is a good fit for the new headquarters.
“Trying to attract 50,000 more employees, they’re looking for a great place to live and to work. And they want to be able to walk around the city and have great restaurants and arts,” Bowser said in the video. “Well, that’s why a thousand people move here every month.”
D.C.’s bid comes after Amazon’s public request last month for proposals, which asks cities to show the company why they should build their new headquarters there.
Amazon said it is seeking a metropolitan area accessible by public transportation and near a national airport, according to its website.
The company plans to invest $5 billion into the urban area it chooses for its new headquarters and aims to make its new campus “a full equal” to the company’s headquarters in Seattle.
The new headquarters will reportedly take up over 8 million square feet of office space, an area greater than that of the Pentagon. Amazon has said that the headquarters will provide up to 50,000 jobs, raising the stakes for cities that have announced bids. Cities across the United States like Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, and Denver have already announced bids. Toronto and Vancouver have also announced bids.
Citing D.C.’s growing population and tech scene, Bowser believes that D.C. is ideal for a new headquarters.
“With our growing tech scene, talented and diverse workforce and inclusive environment, Washington, D.C., is well-positioned to welcome Amazon,” Bowser said at a press conference Sept. 14.
Bowser also explained that the city is attractive to potential employees.
“People know they’re coming to D.C. to start and grow their businesses and they have access to some of the most talented people and the top universities in the world,” Bowser said in the video.
Washington, D.C., is the world’s first LEED Platinum city, which could be a draw if Amazon wants to increase their focus on sustainability as a company, and is also a hub for technological innovation, Bowser said.
“I’m sure Amazon employees are just as committed as we are to being green and sustainable,” Bowser said in the video. “They’re making big decisions around shopping and changing the world and we do the same thing right here in Washington, D.C.”
Bowser also mentioned Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’s ties to D.C., including his ownership of The Washington Post and a $23 million home in the Kalorama Heights neighborhood.
Bowser is seeking assistance from D.C. residents in integrating community suggestions in the proposal. Given that Amazon’s new headquarters will affect residents, she has also asked for locals’ input.
All suggestions are due by Sept. 22, in advance of Amazon’s Oct. 19 proposal deadline.
“So, in addition to weighing in on social media, I am asking residents and stakeholders in all eight wards to help my team by submitting testimonials about why D.C. is a great place to do business, suggestions for creative [Response For Proposal] response elements that showcase D.C., and any and all ideas you may have for our proposal,” Bowser said on the website.
