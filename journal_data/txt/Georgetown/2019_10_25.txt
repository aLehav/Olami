The Georgetown University Student Association Senate unanimously voted in support of a bill to dissolve the GUSA Fund, a committee that redistributed a small part of the student activities fee to clubs that request additional funding, at its weekly meeting Oct. 20. 
Senators voted to amend the GUSA bylaws to eliminate the GUSA Fund, an executive-appointed, five-member committee to the senate finance and appropriations committee, according to GUSA senator Harrison Nugent (SFS ’20), who introduced the legislation.
Under the new system, all clubs will apply directly to the FinApp committee for ad hoc funding. Granting funds will be up to the discretion of the 12-member FinApp committee, which votes on a majority basis whether to approve a request. 
The FinApp committee is the body that allocates the student activities fee, an $84 semesterly fee paid by students to fund seven student group advisory boards, the Georgetown Program Board, the Georgetown University Lecture Fund and the GUSA executive. 
The GUSA Fund historically managed approximately $15,000 and distributed it to various student organizations that applied directly for additional need-based funding, according to its Facebook page. The GUSA executive’s discretionary funds, which fluctuate yearly based on FinApp committee deliberations, determined the fund’s resources. 
In March 2019, GUSA’s total funding, which includes the GUSA Fund, faced a drastic cut, receiving only 11% of the money requested from the FinApp committee during the club funding process. GUSA executives Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20) and Aleida Olvera (COL ’20) were awarded just $1,735 in the budget approved by the FinApp committee March 17, with the money for the GUSA fund coming from that amount.
The previous year, the FinApp committee granted the GUSA Fund $13,955. 
Dissolving the GUSA Fund will not negatively impact campus organizations that use it for additional club support, Nugent wrote. 
“I think this bill helps clubs in the long run because, if Club X keeps having to request ad hoc funding from FinApp, members of FinApp are specifically equipped to provide a long-term solution to this club by adjusting their advisory board’s allocation,” Nugent wrote. “If clubs are keeping good financial records and show a demonstrated need for ad hoc funding, they will have nothing to worry about.”
The ad hoc funding will still be set by the president and the senate speaker at an annual budget summit, according to Nugent. 
Though Francis and Olvera plan to sign the legislation, the pair expressed concern over the FinApp committee’s ability to fulfill GUSA Fund’s role as an executive-appointed funding source. 
“We made it clear that we want to preserve GUSA Fund as a power that is held within the exec, but we want to respect the Senate’s decision and work with them to find an optimal solution that does not completely erase the executive’s oversight of GUSA Fund,” Olvera wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We believe that by removing the executive team from control of GUSA Fund, we lose out on what GUSA Fund was created for.”
Despite intentions to approve the bill, the administration believes the transition of the GUSA Fund will disproportionately affect underrepresented populations on campus.
“In our conversations with student leaders across campus, many women-led and minority-centered groups that have utilized GUSA Fund in the past have expressed their dissatisfaction with the funding boards,” Aleida wrote.
The structure of the new legislation does not encourage the FinApp committee to disadvantage minority groups on campus, according to Nugent.
“There is no incentive on the part of any FinApp committee to cut costs by rejecting funding to minority and women’s based organizations,” Nugent wrote. “This bill was approved unanimously by the GUSA Senate specifically because it addressed those concerns, and any allegations of this nature are not validated by the facts of the bill.” 
Former senator and transition FinApp chair Matthew Buckwald (COL ’20) introduced legislation to amend the GUSA bylaws to abolish the GUSA Fund on July 29 but resigned before the GUSA senate could officially vote on his legislation. 
After Nugent introduced an act to abolish the GUSA Fund in the transition senate Sept. 15, Francis and Olvera expressed support for the GUSA Fund, arguing that many organizations that benefit from the fund serve women and minority students. That legislation was met with criticism, and Nugent ultimately pulled it from consideration.
Transitioning control of the fund will better meet the needs of the students, because the senators who compose the FinApp committee are directly elected, according to Nugent.
“I think that this bill will truly increase oversight of the money GUSA allocates because FinApp is composed of elected representatives, has weekly public meetings, and publicizes all of its meeting minutes,” Nugent wrote.
During the elections for committee leadership, Nugent and Juliana Arias (SFS ’20) both ran for FinApp committee chair on opposing platforms on the GUSA Fund. While Nugent called for dissolving the fund, Arias supported the GUSA Fund and called for ways to reform it instead. Arias won and became the current FinApp committee chair. 
“GUSA fund will stay, but we don’t have set parameters for how it will be reformed,” Arias wrote in a September email to The Hoya. 
But when Nugent introduced the new legislation Sunday, Arias voted in support of dissolving the GUSA Fund.
The new funding mechanism will support student organizations better than the GUSA Fund, according to Arias. 
“The new bill will help the Senate better represent the student body and its needs when it comes to club funding allocation,” Arias wrote in an email to The Hoya, “As a Result, funding will be allocated more efficiently and distributed based on individual clubs’ needs, catering to the interests of our student body.”

Two elevators in Harbin Hall malfunctioned Tuesday night, with one elevator falling one floor and trapping a student inside for nearly two hours.
An elevator car in the freshman dormitory dropped from the sixth floor to the fifth floor around 11 p.m., according to eyewitnesses Micah Hamilton (COL ’23) and Araya Zackery (COL ’23). Giovonni White (MSB ’23), who was riding the elevator at the time, was stuck in the elevator from around 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. 
Hamilton, who was standing near the elevators on the sixth floor when the accident occurred, said that shortly after White entered the elevator, he heard a loud crashing noise from the elevator shaft. Several other residents also heard the crash and contacted the Georgetown University Police Department.
Zackery, who was in the lobby when she saw that the elevator was stuck on the fifth floor, said students in Harbin have experienced the two elevators malfunctioning since the beginning of the semester.
“I enter the dorms and see 3-4 people waiting for an elevator,” Zackery wrote in a message to The Hoya. “I ask if the elevators are broken or not because it’s such a common occurrence.”
White, who was stuck in the elevator car without his phone and computer, said he ended up napping during the long wait as GUPD, the Office of Planning and Facilities Management, and the fire department worked to free him. 
“I was going down — down the elevator — and I got stuck, and I was just sitting there for like two hours. I was there tired, sleepy — it was late at night.” White said. “It just fell down and stopped working. It was crazy.”
The facilities employees addressed the issue by freeing the student and bringing the elevator back into operation in what they believed to be a timely manner, according to Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Benjamin Kuo.
“We promptly responded to a report of a student trapped in a Harbin elevator,” Kuo wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Facilities was able to successfully release the student and identified the problem as an improperly functioning governor’s switch.”
The governor’s switch, which acts as a stopping mechanism in case the elevator runs beyond its rated speed, was repaired early the next morning, according to Kuo. 
Facilities wants to reassure residents that the elevators in Harbin meet safety standards, Kuo wrote.
“Safety is a top priority for Facilities Management, and we are committed to ensuring all elevators are operational, reliable, and safe to use,” Kuo wrote. “The Harbin elevators remain safe and operational. We encourage any community members to report any issues or concerns to Facilities Management.”
The second Harbin elevator stopped working shortly after midnight due to a bad relay, a device that controls the speed, position and door operation of an elevator. The second elevator was also fixed Wednesday morning, according to Kuo.
Elevators in Reynolds Hall and Darnall Hall experienced similar issues last year, sometimes  suddenly dropping floors and stranding students inside. Between September and November of 2018, facilities responded to about 29 work requests related to elevators, from elevators being out of service to light bulb replacements.
Elevator malfunctions make up only a fraction of facilities issues reported on campus. Last fall, students reported unsafe living conditions and health concerns because of the prevalence of mold in dormitories. In February, 84 residents of top-floor apartments in Alumni Square were forced to relocate for the rest of the semester after structural engineers expressed concerns about water damage and pressure on the buildings’ roofs.
Zackery said the incident of an elevator malfunction was not isolated, noting frequent infrastructural problems that affect the well-being of Harbin residents and claiming that repairs are not made in a timely manner.
“Not only do the Harbin elevators break weekly, but they often fail to get fixed for up to 72 hours,” Zackery wrote. “Considering the people who attend this institution pay tens of thousands of dollars, it would be expected that we would have better facilities to use. Ones that don’t break, flood, or affect our health (mold or drinking water) would seem agreeable, but apparently not.”

Four parents accused of bribery and fraud to gain their children’s acceptance to Georgetown University pleaded guilty for their roles in the college admissions scandal Monday. 
Manuel and Elizabeth Henriquez, Douglas Hodge and Michelle Janavs, who all initially pleaded not guilty, changed their pleas to guilty in a Boston federal court. The plea change comes as trials from the March 2019 scandal are expected to begin soon; prosecutors have warned their clients about potential new charges that might come against parents who do not enter a plea deal, according to The New York Times.
Prosecutors alleged that the Henriquez parents paid $400,000 for their daughter, Isabelle Henriquez, to be fraudulently admitted as a tennis recruit to Georgetown in 2016, in addition to paying for both of their daughters to use a fraudulent test proctor on their college entrance examinations on four separate occasions. 
Attorneys for Manuel Henriquez, former CEO of a financial firm, declined to comment for this story. Attorneys for Elizabeth Henriquez did not respond to a request for comment. 
Hodge, former CEO of a global investment management firm, also pleaded guilty to participating in the scheme. Hodge’s daughter was accepted to Georgetown as a tennis recruit in 2008 but never played tennis at the university. Two of Hodge’s children were also accepted to the University of Southern California as fake athletic recruits. 
Michelle Janavs, whose uncle and father invented Hot Pockets, allegedly paid $400,000 for her son, Grant Janavs (COL ’21), to be admitted as a fake tennis recruit to Georgetown, according to an April 2019 indictment. Michelle Janavs is accused of perpetrating a similar scheme to admit her daughter into USC as a fake beach volleyball recruit, as well as paying for her children to use a fraudulent proctor for the ACT in 2017 and 2019, according to the April indictment. 
Attorneys for Janavs did not respond to a request for comment. Grant Janavs also did not respond to a request for comment. 
During his appearance in court, Manuel Henriquez, who became visibly emotional, conceded that he was guilty but maintained that he did not willfully participate in a bribe, according to The New York Times. Henriquez said he believed he was making a legal donation to Georgetown’s tennis program but was misled by William “Rick” Singer, whose company, Edge College & Career Network, was at the center of the scheme. 
“I am deeply sorry for the actions that I have taken and the awful and destructive impact it has had on the family, my children,” Henriquez said in an exchange reported by The New York Times. “I provided a donation to the foundation rather than to the university directly, because Mr. Singer insisted that that was the way it had to be done.”
Stephen Semprevivo, who paid $400,000 for his son to be accepted to Georgetown as a fake tennis recruit, was sentenced to four months in prison in September. His son, Adam Semprevivo, who would have graduated from Georgetown in 2020, was expelled in May 2019 and filed a lawsuit against the school, which he subsequently dropped. (Full disclosure: Semprevivo formerly served as the cartoonist for The Hoya.)
Former Georgetown tennis coach Gordon Ernst was the key to the success of these schemes, enrolling the four parents’ children as fake tennis recruits. Ernst was asked to step down for his misconduct in admissions before the scandal was made public, according to Associate Vice President for Strategic Communications Meghan Dubyak. 
“In 2017, Georgetown’s Admissions Office discovered irregularities in the athletic credentials of two students who were being recruited to play tennis,” Dubyak wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Neither student was admitted. Georgetown immediately put former coach Gordon Ernst on leave, initiated an internal investigation, established a new policy concerning the recruitment of student athletes, implemented audits to check whether recruited student athletes are on team rosters, and asked Mr. Ernst to resign.” 
Ernst received at least $2.7 million in bribes through Singer to designate his clients’ children as tennis recruits, totaling at least 12 students, according to the March 2019 indictment. 
Following the March 2019 indictment, Georgetown contacted students who may have been involved to give them an opportunity to respond. After the university’s review of information related to the admissions scheme, two students were dismissed from Georgetown, and their admissions offers were rescinded, according to Dubyak. The university has not named the two students, and Georgetown does not comment on individual cases, according to Dubyak. 
Grant Janavs is still enrolled at Georgetown, according to his LinkedIn. 
Knowingly misrepresenting information on an admissions application can be cause to rescind admission or dismiss a student, according to Dubyak. 
“Each student case was addressed individually and each student was given multiple opportunities to respond and provide information to the University,” Dubyak wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our review focused on whether students knowingly provided false information to the University or whether they participated in improper activity during the admissions process.”

The one thing I kept hearing my freshman year at GU was,” If they thought you couldn’t do the work, you never would have gotten in.” That was such a comfort to me as I had my doubts  about being there. Pulling a 97 on David Goldfrank’s World History final and getting an A for the year was such a boost to my ego that I knew I was qualified to be in SFS! The confidence the degree gave me led my becoming a poet as my avocation.

Jean-Pierre Lacroix, Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations at the United Nations, spoke about the challenges and misconceptions of UN peacekeepers at an Oct. 21 event. 
The largest part of the UN is the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, and the Department of Peace Operations budget is more than all other entities of the UN combined, according to the UN’s 2019 annual report. Lacroix, as the head-secretary of this group, is responsible for some of the 90,000 uniformed peacekeepers currently deployed in 13 locations worldwide. 
In his address, Lacroix spoke about both the goals and complexities that peacekeeping operations face around the world. 
“Ultimately it’s about supporting peace and creating conditions for durable peace to prevail,” Lacroix said. “No matter what the mandate is and no matter what peacekeeping operation you’re looking at.”
Lacroix stressed that this aspiration is not something that UN peacekeeping missions can achieve alone. Rather than conducting these missions on its own, the UN is intended to support international partners and efforts, according to Lacroix. 
“I think of peacekeeping as a bunch of people with blue helmets, women and men in uniform with the blue badge of the UN or the blue beret,” Lacroix said. “But it’s essentially a political proposition. It’s about supporting peace efforts.”
The event, held in the Healy President’s room, was jointly sponsored by the School of Foreign Service, the Master of Science in Foreign Service program, the African studies program, the Mortara Center for International Studies, the department of government and the M.A. in Conflict Resolution program. Government professor Lise Howard, introduced Lacroix.
SJ Fernandez, a first-year graduate student in the Conflict Resolution program, found this element of Lacroix’s talk especially compelling. 
“Often time humanitarian aid work is supposed to remain independent and neutral and impartial,” Fernandez said in an interview with The Hoya. “However, this talk really discussed the collaborative efforts between peacekeepers and states in order to sustain peace.”
In its 2019 annual report, the UN underscored the need for action to prevent global trends such as the rise of regional violence, terrorism and violent extremism. During 2018 alone, nearly 71 million people were displaced as a result of violence and persecution, according to the report. The year 2018 also marked the 70th anniversary of UN peacekeeping.
Promoting international cooperation and partnerships is the number one challenge he faces, according to Lacroix.
“It’s an even bigger challenge now because, as I was suggesting, we don’t have a united international community,” Lacroix said. “We have a divided international community less effective in getting together and supporting peace efforts in different places.”
Looking back at the history of the UN’s peacekeeping missions, Lacroix believes there is still work to be done to shift international perception of these UN peacekeepers. 
“To our member states of the UN, to all who have an interest in peacekeeping, there has to be a right understanding of what peacekeeping operations are,” Lacroix said.
Learning about the UN peacekeeping operations in the context of different countries is important because it involves individual motives of leaders, according to Rolf Niederstrasser, a first-year graduate student in the MSFS studying Latin America.
“Whenever the UN is present, there is some time of stability, like [Lacroix] was saying,” Niederstrasser said in an interview with The Hoya. “But also what might be the motive behind a president not wanting to have the UN there?”
While there are examples of the UN successfully ensuring stability in a region, there may be flaws in both how UN peacekeepers are viewed as well why they are deployed, Niederstrasser said.
“We see them as a force of good, but sometimes it didn’t happen,” Niederstrasser said. “Seeing that perspective, from what are their limits, what types of other organizations might resolve it better and does a country have the capacity to do it on their own.”
Howard also stressed the importance of recognizing the successes and failures of past peacekeeping missions when considering the future of the UN, she said.
“I started by saying it’s not so bad and we heard at the end that there are some places where it’s really not working so well,” Howard said. “We acknowledge and try to learn and try to figure out a path forward. That involves you. That involves young people thinking very deeply and seriously about how to help.”

Students lobbied to preserve the Blommer Science Library at a Georgetown University Student Association town hall Oct. 23, in response to an announcement last spring that the library would permanently close within the next year. 
The town hall comes after university officials announced in April that Blommer, which is located in the Reiss Science Building, would permanently close and the library’s collections would be relocated to Lauinger Library because of renovations set for Reiss due to flooding and mold concerns.
After the announcement, students started an online petition to keep the library open, which had obtained 421 signatures at time of print. The library’s relocation was then put on hold over the summer pending reevaluation.
To address the backlash about the closure, the university created the Blommer Library Faculty Review Committee to help decide the library’s future, according to committee member and chemistry department Co-Chair Tim Warren. Committee members include Dean of the Library Harriette Hemmasi and a graduate student representative, as well as select faculty members from each science department, the School of Foreign Services’s science, technology and international affairs major and the School of Nursing and Health Studies.
Relocating Blommer could create conflict for faculty and students who use the library as a collaborative research space, according to Warren. 
“The faculty are concerned as well because it’s used for lots of different ways in teaching and then in our scholarship that we jointly do with students,” Warren said in an interview with The Hoya. “We just want to make sure it doesn’t have a negative impact on all the academic programs and research that’s going on.”
The committee will meet during the spring 2020 semester and offer a recommendation to both the provost and main campus executive faculty, who will then vote to decide plans for Blommer, according to Warren.
If the committee decides to move Blommer’s resources to Lauinger, the Blommer science librarians will be relocated to other Georgetown libraries, according to Blommer librarian Holly Surbaugh. 
“We would try to compensate as much as possible,” Surbaugh said. “Jill and I would still be there would still be primarily focused on serving science students and providing access to science collections.”
The town hall featured a question-and-answer session for attendees with Warren and librarians Jill Hollingsworth and Surbaugh. GUSA historian Henry Westerman (SFS ’21) moderated the discussion. 
The event sought to clarify some of the uncertainty surrounding the future of the library, according to Westerman. 
GUSA vice president Aleida Olvera (COL ’20) frequents Blommer to find many of her science textbooks and use the scientific software downloaded onto the computers. Closing Blommer would negatively impact access to resources for science students, she said at the town hall.   
“I know many science students call Blommer their home, so not having the ability to have our own library is kind of jarring — especially because now we will only have one library,” Olvera said.
Blommer regulars provided a passionate dissent leading to the reassessment, according to Hollingsworth. 
“We had a haiku contest last spring and somebody posted a little haiku about, ‘Oh Blommer, we will miss you so,’” Hollingsworth said in an interview with The Hoya. “That kind of sums it up.”  
Unlike many workspaces in Lauinger, the main library on campus, Blommer is quieter and provides a better study environment, according to Blommer regular Kara Struckman (COL ’22). 
“I think Lau is very overcrowded. And for me having my own space, I can’t focus unless I have a big space, and that’s something I really like about Blommer,” Struckman said at the town hall. “There’s also more natural light and for me, the environment in Blommer is much more conducive to being productive.”
Blommer is currently open until midnight Sunday through Wednesday nights with shorter hours Thursday through Saturday nights, which makes it available later than other alternatives to Lauinger such as the Bioethics Research Library in Healy Hall, which usually closes at 9 p.m. 
The committee will host at least two focus groups to learn more about how students use Blommer’s resources. As the plans for the library are decided, Warren hopes that the student engagement will shape the future of Blommer.  
“Student feedback is crucial for this process to work well for the Georgetown community. I’m excited that we have a chance to talk about the ways that students use the Blommer Science Library,” Warren said. “It’s very heartening to hear it serves as the glue in the community of science students here.”

I loved Blommer while I was on campus. It was a reliable, friendly place to work and study away from the main library chaos. I hope students are able to save it!

The Georgetown University School of Medicine’s Dean for Medical Education Stephen Mitchell will conclude his 20-year term June 30, the university announced in a campus-wide email Oct. 22.
After his term ends, Mitchell will assume the title of dean emeritus, an honorary title for a retired dean. University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95), will conduct a nationwide search for the next School of Medicine dean, along with Executive Vice President for Health Sciences and Executive Dean of the School of Medicine Edward Healton, according to the email. 
Mitchell hopes his successor will continue the growth and success of the medical school he cultivated as dean, Mitchell wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
“I am most deeply grateful for the recent privilege of serving as leader of medical education at Georgetown for nearly two decades,” Mitchell wrote. “Now new leadership will continue building on these improvements that will help maintain our School of Medicine as one of the top medical schools in the world.”
As dean, Mitchell helped create the Longitudinal Academic Tracks, five tracks within the School of Medicine which allow students to engage with various areas of interest in conjunction with the four-year medical school curriculum, according to DeGioia’s email. Mitchell also contributed to establishing the medical school’s academic families, which provide mentorship for first-year and second-year medical students.
Mitchell will continue to serve as a faculty member in the department of medicine while serving as dean emeritus. Mitchell will also continue his work as a clinician in the division of rheumatology at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, Mitchell wrote. 
Mitchell has epitomized Georgetown’s values through his maintained devotion to the school’s success, according to Healton. 
“We’re grateful to Ray for his years of service to Georgetown, his embodiment of the Jesuit principle of cura personalis, and for his passion, enthusiasm and dedication for medical education,” Healton wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are privileged to have him continue as a member of our community.” 
Mitchell has received every residency teaching award in the department of medicine in his tenure at the school, according to the university website. Mitchell’s teaching and mentorship have also been recognized by his students, who nominated him for multiple Golden Apple awards. The Golden Apple commendation recognizes professors with outstanding professional and personal qualities that have enhanced the medical education of members of the class.
Mitchell first joined Georgetown’s faculty in 1988 when he accepted a position providing teaching and care for patients with rheumatic diseases at Medstar Hospital, according to DeGioia’s email. Mitchell began his tenure as dean for medical education in May 2002. 
Mitchell’s dedication to teaching and the practice of medicine has helped shape the course of medical education at Georgetown for over 30 years, DeGioia wrote in the email.
“Over the course of his years of service, Ray’s leadership has had a tremendous impact, both here at Georgetown and throughout the medical community,” DeGioia wrote. “Our University is fortunate to continue to benefit from Ray’s membership in our community as Dean Emeritus, and look forward to his contributions as part of our medical education faculty for years to come.”
During his tenure, Mitchell oversaw an expansion of the Georgetown Experimental Medical Studies program, which prepares underrepresented students for success in medical education, according to DeGioia’s email. He also helped establish the Academy for Research, Clinical and Health Equity Scholarship, a six-week pipeline program for undergraduate students interested in pursuing medical studies. 
Mitchell also played a role in the creation of the Curricular Innovation, Research and Creativity in the Learning Environment grant program, which has awarded $1.5 million in competitive curricular development grants.
Mitchell cites his greatest accomplishment at Georgetown as fostering an environment at the medical school that prioritizes the health and prosperity of students.
“As the nation deals with burn out among health professionals, I am perhaps proudest of work our team has done to focus on student well-being and our learning culture,” Mitchell wrote. “This promotes formation of the whole person as St. Ignatius would want us to do.”

Sports journalist and ESPN panelist Kevin Blackistone stressed the need to address free speech restriction in professional and collegiate sports at an event in the Baker Living Room Tuesday.
Blackistone started his career at The Boston Globe as a city reporter before transitioning to the sports section, becoming an award-winning investigative reporter and sports columnist. He frequently appears on the ESPN “Around the Horn” program, which features roundtable discussions of sports news.
The event, “Free Speech and Sports,” was hosted by the Free Speech Project at Georgetown University, a nonpartisan project launched in 2017 that seeks to highlight issues of free speech around the world. 
Spectators pay for tickets to sports games expecting the event to be a form of entertainment separate from politics, which causes the restriction of free speech for athletes, Blackistone said.
“There are a lot of restrictions, constrictions in sports that you won’t necessarily find other places which is why when an incident, a moment does take place in sports, where someone exercises their freedom of speech, it becomes such a big story,” Blackistone said. “We’ve set this up as an arena, a stage, a platform where this is not supposed to take place, and where you have surrendered your right to freedom of speech in order to participate in these games.”
Beyond the restrictions placed on professional players, colleges also prevent their athletes from speaking on particular issues, according to Blackistone.
“They can get away with what they do in terms of restricting speech,” Blackistone said. “I’m always gleeful when I see an incident where they lose that control, where athletes, sometimes coaches, but often athletes will speak their mind, very intelligently about a particular issue, or take a stance that winds up moving a needle.”
Blackistone highlighted Paul Robeson, a successful college football player at Rutgers whose career was effectively ruined after he praised the Soviet Union’s treatment of black descendants of slaves. He also recounted the story of Rose Robinson, an African American high jumper who refused to stand during the national anthem in protest of American foreign policy at the 1959 Pan American games. Her career was over soon after that, Blackistone said.
On the other hand, sports offered one of the first opportunities for African Americans to express their opinions in ways that they were not able to before Emancipation, Blackistone said.
“Athletics became a way for the enslaved to purchase their freedom, and, in purchasing their freedom, also purchasing some of the liberties that other citizens in this country had been afforded,” Blackistone said. “One of those liberties, within the context of free speech, was the ability to publish and the ability to share your thoughts with others.”
Despite this history of sports serving as an avenue for new liberties, sports are also a domain in which free speech can be heavily restricted, according to Blackistone.
“When you talk about free speech and you talk about sports, you are really talking about an arena within society that may be more constrictive and restrictive on free speech than anyplace else,” Blackistone said.
The intersection of free speech and sports has become more of a topic of discussion in recent years because of protests by professional athletes during the national anthem and other forms of political protest.
Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick received backlash when he refused to stand for the pledge of allegiance in a series of NFL games in protest of police brutality and racism, which sparked a conversation about the participation of professional athletes in political and social issues. 
Earlier this month, Los Angeles Lakers player LeBron James became the center of attention because of his comments about Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, after Morey retweeted a slogan in support of the protesters in Hong Kong.
Despite the recent attention athletes like Kaepernick have received for their outspoken views on free speech, they are not the first athletes to use sports as a form of protest, according to Blackistone.
“Everyone thinks Colin Kaepernick was the first, but he’s not,” Blackistone said. “He’s really just part of a lineage.”
Athletes are held to separate standards from the general public for what they can and cannot say, according to Blackistone.
“Sports is a really tight space in which to exercise freedom of speech,” Blackistone said. “In fact, it’s almost an oxymoron because you really don’t have any, and those who exercise it suffer consequences the rest of us don’t.”

Embrace a diversity of narratives about the American experience, New York Times bestselling author Tayari Jones said at a Georgetown University Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Practice event Oct. 23. 
Jones is the author of four fictional novels, including “An American Marriage,” which was selected by President Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey’s reading lists. “An American Marriage” is her most recent book and has won the Women’s Prize for Fiction, the Aspen Words Prize and an NAACP Image Award. Jones currently serves as a Cornell University professor-at-large and an Emory University professor of creative writing.
Jones’ protagonists in “An American Marriage” are black; however, they do not represent all members of the black community, according to Jones. 
“I came from an era of black writers who don’t have to write about being black persay,” Jones said. “Blackness is the condition of our characters but it doesn’t have to be the exact subject matter. The characters don’t feel like a representative.”  
Although Jones’ works examine the black experience, the author sometimes faces criticism for not highlighting issues such as racism in her books, she said. 
“White writers write stories about families and their emotions,” Jones said. “But I sometimes get negative feedback where they are like, ‘Too much family, not enough racism.’”
The Lannan Center hosted the reading and conversation with Jones in Copley Formal Lounge as a part of its reading and talks initiative, which invites authors to Georgetown’s campus to speak about their works. Aminatta Forna, the visiting chair of poetics and interim director of Lannan Center, moderated the event. 
“An American Marriage” tells the fictional story of a newlywed black couple from Atlanta that faces marital struggles after the husband is accused of rape and sentenced to 12 years in prison. 
When deciding on a title for the novel, Jones initially disliked “An American Marriage” because “American” improperly characterized her story of the young black couple, she said.
“I’ve never been called an American, not without another word in front of it,” Jones said. “I’ve been called a black American. I’ve been called an African American.”
However, the author later warmed up to the title after an unnamed mentor reminded Jones about her American right to assert her citizenship, according to Jones. 
“She said, ‘So many people made so many sacrifices so that you might have the full benefit of your citizenship, and part of the benefit of your citizenship is that you can claim it for yourself,’” Jones said.  
Jones originally hails from Atlanta, Ga. The majority of her books take place in the city, including “Leaving Atlanta,” a novel which tells the story of young Atlantans coming of age during the Atlanta Child Murders, a series of homicides that claimed the lives of 28 black children and young adults between 1979 and 1981. 
Jones’ works explore the Southern experience, which is often wrongly judged by those from Northern states, according to Jones. 
“I realized how misunderstood the South is, particularly the urban South,” Jones said. “They think the South is shorthand for black misery, and so I think at some point I did consciously start writing against that myth.” 
Jones tries to respect the vernacular of minority groups in her writing because people who have had the English language imposed on them reshape the dialect in valuable ways, she said. 
“When I tell people I am an English professor, they think, ‘Oh ,she’s going to be correcting me all the time,’” Jones said. “All over the world, people have taken the language and bent it for their own needs, and I always try to honor the way people speak.” 
While Jones had not received significant recognition or awards before “An American Marriage” gained public acclaim, she always felt that she wrote without an expectation of how many people would recognize her work.
“I think that my invisible girlhood prepared me for the experience of being an invisible writer in writer in America,” Jones said. “I’m really used to satisfying only myself. I never thought anyone would pay much attention to what I did, so I wasn’t disappointed.”

Georgetown University student organizations and clubs protested period poverty at the Washington, D.C. National Period Day Rally on Oct. 19.
Period poverty refers to how economic factors can decrease access to menstrual products for certain individuals. The rally, organized by PERIOD, a global youth-run nonprofit that seeks to end period poverty and the stigma around menstruation, was held in honor of the world’s first National Period Day.
At least nine Georgetown students attended the rally from campus groups including the Period Empowerment Project, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and Hoyas For Immigrant Rights. About 500 people attended the rally, gathering in front of the United States Capitol, according to Politico. 
Demonstrators advocated for an end to the “tampon tax,” a sales tax on feminine hygiene products in 35 states, and campaigned for easy access to menstrual products in all public schools, prisons and shelters, according to rally attendee and Period Empowerment Project Treasurer Rhya Evans (NHS ’22). 
“It is unacceptable that ignorance of such a normal and crucial biological process is so widespread and an accepted norm,” Evans wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is this lack of knowledge that perpetuates myths, stigma and normalizes things such as the tampon tax and limited access to menstrual products in places where they should be free.”
The rally also focused on the lack of access that migrants and refugees at the U.S.-Mexico border and in detention centers have to menstrual products, according to the event’s Facebook page. In a lawsuit filed by 19 states against President Donald Trump’s administration in late August, several migrant girls and women reported the lack of access to menstrual products in detention centers, with many being forced to sit in soiled clothing and reuse products.
The rally’s emphasis on increasing immigrant access to menstrual products was crucial in highlighting the low living conditions and injustices that migrant women face in detention centers, according to HFIR activism co-leader Rimpal Bajwa (SFS ’22).
“As an organization, we think that it is admirable that the rally decided to focus on the intersection of immigrant rights and menstrual justice because migrant women are often the most vulnerable to facing such injustice, which is why we think it is imperative to broadcast the narrative of migrant women and the horrifying conditions down at the border and in the detention centers,” Bajwa wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The issue of period poverty was at the forefront of the rally. One in every four women struggle to afford period products due to a lack of income, and a citywide study on period poverty revealed that 46% of low-income women had to choose between a meal and period products, according to PERIOD.
In addition to the rally’s focus on ending period poverty and destigmatizing menstruation, participants and speakers also represented the diversity and intersectionality of the period poverty movement, according to Georgetown NAACP co-President Brody Cook (COL ’20). 
“We cannot continue to bystand a society that denigrates and marginalizes people who menstruate,” Cook wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Additionally, the event created space for leaders of color to provide nuance on how race and class can create compounding conflicts.”
In an effort to provide students with sustainable menstrual product options, the Period Empowerment Project held its third reusable menstrual product giveaway Oct. 22. The collaboration with the Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching and Service included a giveaway of 16 menstrual cups and 15 reusable cloth menstrual pads.
The Period Day protest brought awareness not only to the inequality created by the tampon tax but also to the need for more reproductive health education, according to Evans. 
“Beyond the inequities reflected and caused by the tampon tax, I hope people recognize the other issues such as the underlying stigma concerning all things ‘period’ and greater lack of reproductive health education,” Evans wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Attending the rally also raised awareness of the need to continue to destigmatize menstruation at Georgetown, according to Cook.
“I believe that we need to take the fight against the period tax and accessibility to products to Georgetown’s campus,” Cook wrote. “We can do this by collaborating with aligned organizations on campus, and building visible awareness.”

Increasing education on nutrition and budgeting for low-income students is a tangible way to combat on-campus food insecurity, panelists said at an on-campus discussion Oct. 23.   
The event, titled “Food for Thought,” featured a panel of Georgetown University faculty, students and other activists in the Pedro Arrupe, S.J. Hall Multipurpose Room. Panelists agreed that university students would benefit from education on nutrition and budgeting when starting at Georgetown. 
University administrators should integrate an informative program about the realities of food insecurity on campus into new student orientation, according to panelist and Hoya Hub student assistant Liz Fieschko (SFS ’20). 
“On a student schedule and on a student mindset, when I was also handling classes and working 15 hours a week, it was more difficult for me to plan that plate and find a good way for me to access it,” Fieschko said. “It’s really, really important, almost in a way, if there was somehow, sometime during orientation — or some sort of week before — all first-years in the school, that we talk about realistically what that looks like.” 
The panel also featured Adanna Johnson, Georgetown’s associate vice president for student equity and inclusion; William Hockaday (COL ’20), a food insecurity advocate; Janis Jibrin, a Georgetown adjunct faculty nutrition instructor in the School of Nursing and Health Studies and Erin McGeoy, the CEO of Last Call, a food technology business that communicates deals on surplus food from local eateries. 
The event was co-sponsored by GU Students Advancing Food Equity, a student group seeking to alleviate food insecurity on campus, and the Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching and Service. Julianne Licamele (COL ’21), president of Hoya Hub, a food pantry which offers Georgetown community members free, nonperishable food options, moderated the panel. 
McGeoy recalled her struggles with food insecurity as a student at George Washington University and called for more transparency from universities to their low-income students around the expenses related to meals while in college.
“When I sat down at my living room table with my family and we were budgeting which universities we could afford, GW seemed okay, but it wasn’t the true price tag that was revealed,” McGeoy said. “Universities are businesses, too.”
In response to food insecurity within the Georgetown community, students launched the Hoya Hub last year, located in the Leavey Center. The panel comes after the pantry doubled in size over the summer. The Meal Swipe Drive, a Hoya Hub-hosted event in which students could donate meal swipes students students facing food insecurity, also doubled in contributions this fall. 
Despite growing on-campus resources for students facing food insecurity, Georgetown could still better combat the issue on campus, according to Johnson. 
“This feels like a band-aid on a bullet wound,” Johnson said. “If we’re not thinking about the larger structures that create the need for a food pantry, we’re missing the point.” 
In 2016, the Georgetown University Student Association conducted a survey that found 54% of the 351 students surveyed — two-thirds of whom received need-based financial aid — experience food insecurity at Georgetown because of the cost of food.
Students especially struggle with food insecurity during breaks or other times when on-campus dining options are closed, Fieschko said at the panel.
“I know from my experience of staying on campus during breaks that when everything would shut down, I would have to figure out where to go to get food as a first-generation low-income student,” Fieschko said.
Johnson and the Office of Student Equity and Inclusion are focusing on the needs of the most marginalized students on campus, particularly on the issue of food security, she said. 
“I believe that when we center those students’ needs, that everyone benefits,” Johnson said.
57% of black students and 56% of Latinx students at American universities report food insecurity compared to 40% of white and 45% of Asian students, according to a 2016 College and University Food Bank Alliance-sponsored study. 
Food insecurity is an intersectional issue worsened for certain students because of multiple other parts of their identity, according to Johnson.
“I see very much the intersection between race, class, gender, and how issues of food insecurity, the presence of food deserts in various communities, is compounded by issues of race and gender,” Johnson said. “I thought that in coming to Georgetown, this would not be as significant of an issue as it is.”

Georgetown’s neighborhood Yahoo group and listserv, moderated by the Citizens Association of Georgetown, long a popular forum for community discussion, will move to a new host site, Groups.io, on Oct. 28. 
Forums across Washington, D.C., are doing the same in response to Yahoo’s decision to scale back its Yahoo Groups service. D.C.’s neighborhood forums date back to the nineties and were brought under the Yahoo Groups umbrella after the service began in 2001. The forums are public message boards that allow users to post text and photos and respond to one another.
On Oct. 28, the group’s over 3,000 users will no longer be able to post content to the site, and Dec. 14 all content will be permanently removed. Users can still save their uploads or download their data before that date and have the opportunity to join the new forum on Groups.io, but the GeorgetownForum and others are already closed to the public.
The forum is a valuable way for people in Georgetown to stay connected to one another, according to CAG Program Administrator Nancy Carpenter.
“We’re just always looking for a way — like a forum — to connect our community and share information, and people really depend on it in a way,” Carpenter said in an interview with The Hoya. “I think when it goes away, they’re really going to miss it, and then they’re going to wonder where the new one is.”
She said that CAG’s main task right now is getting people to sign up for the new forum, although it can be difficult to spread the news.
“It really is just a logistic issue of getting people to join a new forum as opposed to remaining on the one that’s going to close, and it’s easier said than done because you have to reach everybody and motivate everybody and provide signage and reminders, and they still have questions,” Carpenter said. “It’s unfortunate that it’s happening so quickly.”
For as long as they’ve been operational, neighborhood forums in D.C. have accomplished an important public good, according to local Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E Commissioner Kishan Putta. 
“I’ve been a member of Yahoo Groups listservs since the 90s,” Putta wrote in an email to The Hoya. “They have been extremely important and beneficial both to me and my neighbors/constituents. They truly are a form of recorded history of our neighborhoods and neighbors’ lives.”
The forum has served him in more practical ways as a neighborhood commissioner, too.
“As a Commissioner, I have often looked back to see what has been said or done before on local issues,” he wrote. “They say that those who don’t learn from history are destined to repeat it, so I have always tried to look back and learn from the past.”
D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department also operates crime-specific listservs, which email crime reports to residents, and forums for community discussion using Yahoo for different city districts, including District 2, which includes Georgetown. MPD said in a statement Oct. 17 that it will create nine new Google Groups in response to Yahoo’s changes.
Moving to Google will improve functionality, according to the Oct. 17 MPD statement. Posts will be publicly visible to any site visitor, and users can sign up with any email rather than needing a Yahoo email to access the old groups. 
“The MPD police discussion groups were originally created in Yahoo over 15 years ago to virtually share public safety information and strengthen our police-community relationships using technology,” the statement said. “This format should provide better quality of service than Yahoo groups, which have been faltering for some time.”
The university’s Office of Community Engagement subscribes to the GeorgetownForum to keep up to date with neighborhood news and to share information about the university, according to Engagement Coordinator Karen Salmeron.
“Our office engages the community regularly, so we think it’s important for us to stay up to date on what’s going on in and around the neighborhoods,” Salmeron wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our office also will post on these neighborhood listservs. We have a weekly publication called, ‘Georgetown University Neighborhood News,’ which shares information regarding University and community happenings for our local neighbors.”
To join the new forum, email [email protected]. Georgetown students can benefit by joining, according to Carpenter.
“You would find out about community events, you would find about maybe crime that’s happening,” she said. “People post things that are for sale, people post so many things — a lot of information.”

Nearly 60 countries have significantly advanced the wellbeing of women in recent years, according to the 2019 Women, Peace, and Security Index released by Georgetown University’s Institute for Women, Peace and Security on Oct. 22.
GIWPS, which was launched in 2011 by former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95), examines the roles of women in fostering peace and security and growing economies around the world. The 2019 WPS Index compares women’s inclusion, access to justice and security in 167 countries. 
The index evaluates countries on 11 indicators of women’s wellbeing and empowerment, including average years of education, financial inclusion, employment and parliamentary representation. Each country is given a numerical score for each subindex and geometric means are used to aggregate the subindex scores into the WPS Index.
This year’s study saw Norway surpass Iceland in ranking the best for women in the second edition of the index, while Yemen is ranked the lowest. The United States moved up from 22nd to 19th place in the rankings.
Women’s empowerment globally is heading in a positive direction, according to Jeni Klugman, managing director of GIWPS and lead author of the index.
“This is good news for everyone, as the world is more secure, peaceful, and prosperous when women are accorded full and equal rights and opportunities,” Klugman wrote in a GIWPS press release.
Notable improvements for women worldwide include greater access to financial services and education and legal reforms, according to the report. However, progress towards women’s economic participation is still slow. Around the world, 2.7 billion women remain legally restricted from working in the same jobs as men.
The most valuable takeaway from the index is that countries should continue to strive towards bettering the lives of women, as the practice benefits society as a whole, according to Lead Student Research Assistant Elena Ortiz (SFS ’21).
“Data analysis finds that higher (better) WPS scores are correlated with lower rates of current intimate partner violence, political violence against women, and infant and maternal mortality rates,” Ortiz wrote in an email to The Hoya. “These findings in particular underline the importance of multidimensionally measuring women’s wellbeing while reinforcing that when women are doing better, society as a whole does better.”  
The index was developed in collaboration with the Peace Research Institute of Oslo, an independent peace and conflict studies research institution, and was funded by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The partnership between GIWPS and PRIO began in 2016, before the first index was released in 2017.
The 2019 index was presented by representatives from GIWPS on Oct. 22 at the United Nations Headquarters. Before its official release, certain key findings were featured in National Geographic magazine.
Ortiz wrote that she is glad that the index has garnered attention from these major institutions.
“Being part of a project reaching heights such as National Geographic and the UN feels surreal,” Ortiz wrote. “When I first started working at GIWPS at the start of the summer, I had no idea that the Index would be featured in their publication, but I think it’s an extraordinary opportunity for the Index to reach a wider audience, ultimately amplifying the powerful impact I know it will have.”
The new index looks at women’s security on three levels, taking into consideration intimate partner violence, sense of security in the local community and organized violence. The WPS index differs from other existing indexes because it takes into account these security factors, according to Marianne Dahl, who led PRIO’s part of the project.
“If you want to capture how it is to be a woman in these countries, you can’t only focus on inclusion and justice,” Dahl said in an interview with PRIO. “Those are important, but if girls don’t feel safe as they walk home from school, if women are often sexually abused or experience violence in their partnerships, that affects their lives in profound ways.”
Ortiz hopes the WPS Index will inspire more countries to adopt policies addressing gender equity.
“I hope it can be a tool for advocates in enlightening policy-makers on the critical importance of women’s wellbeing for everyone in society,” Ortiz wrote. “Especially for countries that have stagnated or fallen in the rankings since 2017, I hope this year’s results put pressure on them to step up their game and prioritize gender equality at the top of their national agendas.”

Georgetown Heritage, a nonprofit working with the Georgetown Business Improvement District, will host a volunteer canal cleanup Saturday, Oct. 26, as the broader Chesapeake & Ohio Canal revitalization effort continues.
Georgetown BID is a nonprofit that maintains and beautifies Georgetown’s commercial district. Georgetown Heritage, a group associated with Georgetown BID, is working with the National Park Service on a multiyear plan to revitalize the C&O Canal, addressing safety and accessibility concerns to increase more recreation and shopping along the canal, according to the NPS. Georgetown Heritage is hosting monthly volunteer cleanups to maintain the canal during the current phase of the renovations.
The volunteers keep the towpath and the canal clean, according to Jeffrey Nichols, executive director of Georgetown Heritage. Nichols assumed the director position in early September, after serving as the president and CEO of Thomas Jefferson’s Poplar Forest.
“We’ve been doing monthly canal cleanups where we walk along the mile section of the canal in Georgetown,” Nichols said in an interview with The Hoya. “It’s an effort to keep on top of an urban environment where there’s lots of trash and lots of opportunities for things to fall into the canal.”
The C&O Canal operated from 1831 to 1924 as a passageway for cargo ships. The canal runs for almost 200 miles along the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., to Cumberland, Maryland. An NPS Environmental Assessment released this month estimates 1.2 million people walk along the canal yearly.
The canal revitalization project is currently in the planning stage, although two of its locks, which raise and lower boats by controlling the canal’s water level, have recently undergone repairs. This month, the NPS assessment also found that the canal lacks accessibility, lighting, seating and recreational areas, in addition to having uneven and narrow paths.
The Environmental Assessment outlines two solutions; the NPS-preferred choice, as denoted by the assessment, involves widening and paving pathways, increasing bridge accessibility, adding lighting and native riparian planting to stabilize the banks. The no-action alternative extends current management operations and provides comparison for the environmental consequences of the proposed renovations.
The NPS is requesting public comment online until Nov. 16 and at a Nov. 7 public meeting. 
The report concluded that the NPS-preferred plan would involve temporary closures of the towpath and elevated noise levels, but construction-related noise could be kept within D.C. regulatory requirements. 
There is a broad desire for a rigorous planning process, according to Nichols. 
“Georgetown-based groups are very keen on finding a way to preserve and restore and enhance the C&O Canal in the mile-long stretch that goes through Georgetown,” Nichols said. “It’s really taking a very detailed look at the canal itself, the structural integrity, how it’s used by the public, what businesses think about it and want to see happen.”
Georgetown Heritage, NPS and city officials held a ribbon-cutting ceremony in Georgetown in September to mark the completion of renovations on the canal’s first two locks. Workers tested the locks by letting water flow through them back in April, and now water is flowing permanently, according to Curbed D.C.
In August, NPS broke ground on a new headquarters for their operations along the C&O Canal in Williamsport, Md. The canal itself stretches 184 miles from Georgetown to Cumberland, Md. Eventually, NPS hopes to have boats running along the canal again, according to WAMU.
The canal renovation project will potentially lead to local business growth, according to Nichols.
“It can be a great addition to the mix of businesses in a linear park setting. We think that as this becomes more engaging and more welcoming for people, that will naturally spill out into people walking along various side roads, going into restaurants, going into stores,” he said.
The renovations are an opportunity to enhance a forgotten part of Georgetown’s downtown, according to Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E Commissioner Matias Burdman (COL ’21). 
“The C&O canal renovation is very significant in that it has the potential to transform the canal — a neighborhood asset that has traditionally been underutilized and poorly kept — into a central feature of Georgetown that serves students, residents, and visitors alike,” Burdman said.

Activists protested in a “Stop Financing Fossil Fuels” demonstration outside the World Bank and International Monetary Fund buildings on Oct. 18 to object against the organizations’ investments in fossil fuel energy.
The protest included about 50 people and was organized by The Big Shift Global campaign, a movement comprised of over 40 international sustainability-focused organizations, according to protest attendee and GU Fossil Free member Sadie Morris (SFS ’22).
The demonstration occurred during the World Bank’s and IMF’s annual Civil Society Policy Forum from Oct. 15 to Oct. 18, where members met to discuss the overall progress of the organizations on topics including sustainable development and climate change. The protest aimed to emphasize the need for the two organizations to invest in sustainable renewable energy rather than fossil fuels, according to the event’s Facebook page. 
The demonstration, which began at Edward R. Murrow Park at the corner of H and 18th and proceeded past the World Bank, IFC and IMF buildings, shut down a portion of H Street, according to Morris. The protest featured six speakers from developing nations, who spoke out against the World Bank and IMF investing in non-sustainable, environmentally-harmful energy programs in their native countries, Morris said.
“There was a series of speakers from the global south, and the general theme was that they were looking for autonomy over their land,” Morris said. “They didn’t want these businesses coming in that were making decisions that were not good for their land. They didn’t want fossil fuels to be built into the loans and the programs that the World Bank or IMF is setting up in their countries.”
The protest stemmed from activists’ frustration with the World Bank’s history of funding fossil fuel initiatives in developing countries in Asia, Africa and South America, according to Morris. 
The World Bank helped with financing or developmental policies of fossil fuel companies in over 45 countries from 2014 to 2018, according to research from environmental group Urgewald, which is cited in The Big Shift Global’s letter to the World Bank.
However, the Urgewald research does not highlight the changes made to energy financing over the years, according to a World Bank Group spokesperson.
“The Urgewald report is inaccurate in its claims about World Bank Group energy financing, and highly selective in the projects and investments it focuses on,” a spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “By focusing on all open projects in our energy portfolio, including legacy projects where financing was approved many years ago, the report does not reflect the substantial changes that have happened in our energy financing over the past decade.” 
Investment in fossil fuels allows powerful organizations to brush off the responsibility of addressing timely environmental issues, according to Morris. 
“Fossil fuels are not the future,” Morris said. “They are not a sustainable source of energy, so I think any kind of investment that’s made there is both a sign that we’re not really looking to the future and it’s not a sustainable decision for our decision-makers to be making for people and our planet.”
Among the roughly 50 people who participated in the protest, many were college students who are a part of the local chapter of the national organization the Sunrise Movement, which advocates for the Green New Deal, proposed legislation that aims to address climate change.
The balance between college students and seasoned environmental activists created an energized environment at the protest, according to Morris. 
“Even though it was a smaller group, it was a group of people who are really invested in the issue and so there was a lot of energy and knowledge in the space,” Morris said. “The crowd of people was a good combination of younger college students and also people who are more involved in climate organizations in D.C. itself.”
This week’s protest had a tangible impact, as protestors grabbed the attention of both pedestrians and those who work at corporations like the IMF, according to Morris.
“You could actually see people pausing and taking notice. I thought that made it feel very productive, especially because the police let us stay so long outside the IMF in particular,” Morris said. “People were coming and going from meetings and they were stopping and watching.”
The “Stop Financing Fossil Fuels” protest showcases how the younger generation is motivated to address the climate crisis, and more specifically, the need to move away from fossil fuels, according to GUFF core member Juliette Leader (SFS ’20). These protests demonstrate to institutions that environmental issues are important and need to be addressed, Leader wrote. (Full disclosure: Leader is a former member of The Hoya’s editorial board).
“Student protests regarding the climate crisis broadly, and fossil fuel divestment specifically, are important because they are an opportunity to demonstrate that these are issues people are passionate about,” Leader wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Young people care about not being complicit in the climate crisis. It’s important for powerful institutions to understand that.”
This article was updated Oct. 30 to change Georgetown University Fossil Free to GU Fossil Free.

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser helped break ground on the future African American Civil War Memorial Museum housed at the Grimke School in an Oct. 17 ceremony. 
The museum tells the stories of 209,145 members of the U.S. Colored Troops who fought for the Union during the Civil War — stories history has largely ignored, according to the museum website. The museum originally opened in 1999. In April 2011, it moved to the gymnasium of the Grimke School, a historic building near U Street named after prominent abolitionist sisters. 
With the school vacant since 2013, the museum decided to expand to take over the school’s space with the assistance of the D.C. government, according to museum founder and director Frank Smith.
“The building belonged to the city and they simply sold it to us,” Smith said. “It is a historic building that was built in 1870, that over the years has undergone great disrepair and neglect. So, we’re bringing life back to a historic building, and also providing a permanent home to the museum.”
The expansion will create more space for exhibits, including primary and secondary sources from thousands of African-American veterans and their descendants. Growing the museum continues the mission that Smith and his colleagues began over twenty years ago.
“The first thing was to correct the great wrong in history, which was to ignore the contributions of these African-American soldiers in ending slavery and keeping America united under one flag,” Smith said. “They were pivotal to those things, and yet they got very little respect in history, literature, movies, or any of the usual things that we use to celebrate and honor it.”
The additional goal of the museum, Smith said, is to contribute to the U Street corridor’s rejuvenation. In 1968, riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King caused mass property damage and a dozen deaths in the area, and Smith hopes the museum can help contribute to the neighborhood’s ongoing growth. 
“We’ve had a small museum for years, we’ve always wanted to enlarge it, enlarge the story, and also to help improve the neighborhood,” Smith said. “We’re claiming this historic building and turning it into a community resource.” 
Smith noted the museum’s numerous outreach efforts, such as bringing more children to museums, as an example of the way the museum seeks to uplift not just the neighborhood but D.C. as a whole. 
“We have a study that says that children who visit museums do better in school and life than ones who do not, but it says also lower income kids don’t go to museums,” he said. “We have a team of people who go into the schools, work with teachers, arrange with them to bring the students to our museum.”
He hopes that the museum will impact every D.C. student.
“My goal is to, within five years, have every student who goes to a D.C. public school to have had at least one visit to this museum and several other museums,” Smith said. “A rising tide ought to lift all boats. If going to museums helps kids, and we got the best museums in town, we ought to have it at their schools.”
The project will also create 100 new jobs and 68 homes on the property, including 21 affordable units, according to an Oct. 17 news release from the Office of the Mayor. 
“The redevelopment of the historic Grimke School showcases how we can build more housing and create more jobs in a way that preserves our culture and history,” Bowser said in the news release. 
The project at Grimke began as a statue monument to the soldiers on U Street, which Smith said helped to ultimately increase the scale of the endeavor. 
“It’s pretty easy to go from a monument to a museum when you have the attention of the public, and the descendants are bringing in their documents, their artifacts, their uniforms,” Smith said. “We have paid honor where honor was due to the heroic efforts of African American soldiers, and their white colleagues, as were most of the officers that led them into battle.”

Online clothing retailer Everlane, which emphasizes a highly transparent production process, is hosting a denim pop-up shop at 1259 Wisconsin Ave. from Oct. 17 to Oct. 27.
Instagram-based brand Everlane chose to solely feature its jeans, which typically cost about $70, for purchase at the pop-up shop. The first floor showcases a variety of designs and cuts, with styles for both men and women available. The second floor serves as a small event space which featured local style bloggers Sarah Phillips, Sylvia Colella and Rebecca Gallop earlier in the week, according to Washingtonian.
Everlane is a primarily direct-to-consumer online brand, although it has four brick-and-mortar stores across the country. After launching online-only in 2010, it gained traction with a streamlined aesthetic and marketing that prioritizes openness of its factory costs and ethics. 
Everlane partnered with Verb, a marketing and event planning company, to design and create the small pop-up shop and staff the event. The two-story storefront was refurbished and highlighted by bright interior design for the store’s short run. 
The pop-up shop’s marketing design serves both Georgetown’s market and Everlane’s goals, according to Verb Coordinator Lou Becker, who is supervising the Georgetown pop-up.
“A lot of our customers are used to online shopping. So, this gives them an opportunity to try things on, feel the fabric, see what sizes and cuts they are, which can be difficult when you only do online shopping,” Becker said in an interview with The Hoya. “The benefit of coming in with a pop-up like this is that people can get a little more comfortable with our products.”
This event is not Everlane’s first pop-up in Georgetown, as the company hosted a cashmere pop-up last fall, Becker said.
This is not the first event that the company has hosted, Becker added, pointing out a similar cashmere pop-up store that the company hosted last fall.
“They’re becoming more common as we have more companies that are based online. Everlane started online, and then became brick-and-mortar,” Becker said. “Everlane has been here a couple times, once with a cashmere truck, this is a denim truck, so they’re always kind of focused on one aspect of the line.”
The pop-up helps online retailers like Everlane market themselves to students who may not otherwise know who they are, according to Lauren Oliveri (COL ’22).
“I rarely order clothes online, except those stores I know well, because you can never really tell how the item will look until you get it and try it on. I think a pop-up shop makes a lot of sense with the way the world is moving online because it’s a lot cheaper than a permanent storefront for some lesser-known companies,” Oliveri said. “I had never heard of Everlane before a friend invited me to come but I’ll probably look at it online in the future.” 
Pop-up shops have become a popular marketing tool in D.C. and other major cities. They are typically publicized online in advance to build excitement and publicity. Brick-and-mortar locations help drive business to online retailers, according to CNBC.
Other companies have experimented with distinct brick-and-mortar concepts in Georgetown recently. Capital One opened a coffee shop-bank concept that doubles as a communal workspace on Wisconsin Avenue in September.
The Wisconsin Avenue location, which is blocks away from the university and in the heart of the Georgetown shopping district, has drawn a range of customers, Becker said. 
“The price point is definitely attractive to a lot of people because they’re super affordable and they’re really high quality,” Becker said. “It’s a great spot for us. We’ve had a great response so far.”
