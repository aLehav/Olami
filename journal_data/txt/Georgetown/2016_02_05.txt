The 2016 Georgetown University Student Association executive race began as the presidential and vice presidential ticket of Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and Chris Fisk (COL ’17) launched its executive bid at midnight Wednesday in Red Square. They are the only candidates to publicly launch a campaign thus far.
According to GUSA Election Commissioner Grady Willard (SFS ’18), the presidential and vice presidential ticket of Tony Pezzullo (MSB ’17) and A.J. Serlemitsos (COL ’17) has also filed to run.
The 2016 race, with only two tickets, sets a different tone from the hotly contested 2015 campaign of six presidential and vice presidential pairings.
Just before midnight, around 50 students from Khan and Fisk’s team entered Red Square from the Intercultural Center accompanied by a portable stereo with strobe lights and the song “Danza Kuduro” by Don Omar before taping up their poster with the slogan “Breaking Barriers, Building Bridges.”
Alex Bobroske (SFS ’17), Khan and Fisk’s campaign manager, said the slogan is focused on unifying various student groups to come together and advocate on behalf of students when working with university administration.
“There’s a lot of bureaucracy in the administration, a lot of reasons that different communities on campus aren’t connecting with each other, or not getting the best advocacy they can,” Bobroske said. “And so that’s the first part of our campaign, is identifying those barriers, and then the second part is building bridges between different communities on campus to make GUSA more inclusive and actually representative of campus, rather than being perceived as a club itself.”
Khan explained that following last year’s executive election, she and Fisk wanted to focus on bringing the Georgetown community together.
“I think, coming off of last year, there was a really divisive and toxic election; I think a lot of people were dissatisfied with what happened there,” Khan said. “This is student government at the end of the day, and what we saw was all that division was not what was good for Georgetown and we wanted to really see people working together.”
Fisk said that inclusivity will be featured prominently in his and Khan’s campaign.
“We’re also strongly pushing a message of inclusivity overall. Restructuring GUSA is the main way of talking about that inclusivity,” Fisk said.
According to Fisk, inclusivity, restructuring GUSA and socio-economics are three principal topics of the platform.
Kotryna Jukneviciute (COL ’18), executive officer of the GUSA senate and co-director of outreach on the Khan-Fisk ticket, said that the campaign will focus on increasing student body engagement with GUSA.
“I think the central goal of this campaign is student engagement because up until this point, you’ve had a lot of very competitive campaigns that have been focused on winning, whereas our goal is more engaging the student body and getting people to have a voice in GUSA, and to have them heard,” Jukneviciute said.
Khan and Fisk’s campaign is one of the largest in GUSA executive campaign history, with around 200 members.
According to Bobroske, the Khan-Fisk ticket also took a more open approach to policy development.
“One of the differences that we did this year compared to past years was, generally, GUSA campaigns would dole out a platform from one or two key experts in the field and just adopt that as their plan,” Bobroske said. “This year we started with that, we went to the experts, but that was only step one. The next part was sitting down and having a meeting open to anybody in our staff, anybody who are experts in the field.”
Serlemitsos wrote in an email to The Hoya that his team has been preparing its candidacy for months, even though it was unable to launch the campaign Wednesday night.
“Tony and I are very excited to announce our candidacy. We have been working in private with our team for months. We are very excited to roll out the campaign in segments,” Serlemitsos wrote. “We apologize that we couldn’t be at Red Square [Wednesday night], as we were both out of town. But we are very excited about the race.”
According to Pezzullo, his and Serlemitsos’ plans to launch their campaign Wednesday night fell through at the last minute.
“We had sent two of our campaign staff Suneel Mudaliar (MSB ’17) and Jack Maher (COL ’17), but the two of them evidently forgot about campaigning tonight. But we’re looking forward to re-energizing them tomorrow … hopefully getting the campaign started in full,” Pezzullo said.
According to Pezzullo, Mudaliar and Maher will serve as co-campaign managers of the Pezzullo-Serlemitsos ticket.
Willard said that even though this year’s election has fewer candidates, it still stands to be an interesting race.
“I think there’s some good debates that we’re going to have. As you know, there is a referendum on live registration versus pre-registration. … There are also critical issues on [Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle] bus turnaround, dining — we just had some news from [Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students] Todd Olson on Kehoe Field,” Willard said. “A lot of issues to be talked about with a couple of candidates, so I think it will be a good election year.”
Serlemitsos wrote in an email to The Hoya that his campaign will seek to provide students with a greater voice and a better environment in which they can enjoy themselves.
“We believe that there need to be additional changes to empower students and thusly balance the scales,” Serlemitsos wrote. “We understand that Georgetown is a place for education, but there are people that want to have fun, and we want to create the right environment for that fun. We believe this issue is paramount to our campaign.”
While he does not want to publish the campaign’s complete platform yet, Pezzullo said that it includes plans to fight Georgetown University Police Department’s proposal to expand jurisdiction outside the front gates.
“We don’t want to give away our entire platform just yet; we want to roll this out sort of in parts,” Pezzullo said. “Something that we do want to oppose is going to be the … legislature that would expand the GUPD jurisdiction off campus and if we can’t get the full movement on that, we at least want to stop pre-emptive patrolling.”
Pezzullo said that results from the University Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey, which ends Feb. 15, will form a significant part of their platform.
“For [the survey], we’re going to move to a different part, putting forward our platform of how we’re going to work with those results later on in the campaign,” Pezzullo said. “We think that’s an extremely important issue that deserves the attention of an entire interview or an entire day. We don’t think that’s something that we want to address alongside all the other issues because it is so important.”
Pezzullo expressed confidence in his campaign’s ability to win with competitive edge.
“I think right now we are the greatest campaign on this campus,” Pezzullo said. “We respect our competition very much, but we expect to squash them. I’m not worried, and I feel very confident. All I’d like to say is that for too long Georgetown has been mired in slow growth and in policies that haven’t really taken shape in any substantive way. At one time, Georgetown was great and I think what we’re going to do is, we’re going to make Georgetown great again.”
As for the Khan-Fisk campaign, Fisk said the team will take a down-to-earth approach with its campaign.
“Yes, we’re going to be very serious in terms of policy, but we’re also people first, we’re students first. And I think that us approaching this whole situation with the fact that we are just like everyone else and all of us need to work together,” Fisk said. “I think we will just be unabashedly ourselves.”
The McDonough School of Business features prominently in this election compared to years past, with both presidential candidates being in the MSB, and the two vice presidential candidates in the College. Last year, 11 out of the 12 students campaigning were in the College, while in 2014, five students were in the School of Foreign Service and three were in the College.
Micki Gallien (SFS ’17) said that she struggles to see the importance of the GUSA executive campaign.
“I don’t know too much about GUSA as a whole. I have a few friends who are really active in it and they’re all really great people with really great intentions and I respect them and wish them all the best, but I haven’t seen exactly how it matters who’s running any of it,” Gallien said. “Maybe that’s just my ignorance — I don’t know exactly what they do and who exactly can accomplish what difference it makes, if any, who’s in what position.”
The presidential and vice presidential debates will be held Feb. 10 and Feb. 15, respectively, before the election is held digitally Feb. 18.

Georgetown administrators and students discussed the ramifications of the closure of Kehoe Field on Feb. 2 and the potential options for re-developing Yates Field House — including building a new recreational facility and three new sports fields — at a Hoya Roundtable discussion in the Healey Family Student Center Social Room on Wednesday evening.
Director of Yates Field House Jim Gilroy said that the final decision to close the field was made Tuesday night after weeks of discussion.
“We just decided we needed to make a decision, because we were concerned about the safety of the students,” Gilroy said.
According to Vice President for Facilities and Operations Robin Morey, Kehoe Field, which is built on the roof of Yates, was closed when it became no longer safe to use.
“We’ve implemented a strategy to make sure that we test the structural capacity of the roof, so everything inside of the building is safe, but this strategy means that we’ll eventually, and as you saw this week, we will prohibit the use of the field,” Morey said.
Kehoe Field has been plagued by problems since it was first constructed in 1942 and then re-constructed on the roof of Yates in 1979. The field was first repaired in 1987 at a cost of $1.8 million before being repaired again in 2002 for $7 million.
According to Morey, the roof has never functioned properly, causing the concrete underneath the roof to deteriorate, leading to leaks inside Yates and unsafe turf conditions.
“It’s very flat, it doesn’t drain properly and a real field should have probably a four- or five-degree elevation change from the center field out to the edges to control the water flow,” Morey said. “So the problem is that you don’t waterproof to hold water, you waterproof to let the water run off. And the problem here is that the water literally stays on the roof every time it rains.”
Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Todd Olson said that the university has been making an effort to find spaces for club sports to train, including the better use of Cooper Field and attempting to take advantage of nearby fields such as the Jelleff Recreation Center at the Jelleff Community Center, part of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Washington. Jelleff field is approximately a seven minute drive from the front gates of Georgetown’s campus.
“[We’re] trying to work with partners on campus,” Olson said. “We’re also actively looking around not just at the Jelleff Field in the local area and D.C. to see where we can maximize use,” Olson said.
Morey said that there are several short-term and long-term options available to repair Kehoe Field, including the complete re-development of Yates and Shaw Field into a new athletic district at a cost of $75 million.
“It could be the highest and best use of the land that we have.” Morey said.
According to Morey, the new recreational center and three new fields would be able to make better use of the current space, especially as the hospital is considering building a new surgical pavilion where the helipad would relocate, from its current location northwest of Yates Field House.
Other options include repairing the current roof to last approximately 10 years at a cost of $10 million, thus losing the field for a year, or rebuilding the roof to last approximately 30 years at a cost of $30 million and closing the field for 18 months.
Morey said that he sees the school moving in the direction of a complete re-development of Yates, Kehoe Field and Shaw Field.
“I think that we are on a path to re-imagining Yates as a new fitness and wellness center. So phase one is integrated into the master planning work, that’s the way we think about it,” Morey said. “So now what confronts us, the challenge we have, is to continue that aspiration.”
Gilroy said, however, that he thinks the most helpful solution is to perform another temporary fix to the roof.
“I just think that the long-term fix is a long way away. So I think in the meantime we should provide another field for the students to be able to use,” Gilroy said.
According to Olson, a decision about how best to proceed will be made within 12 months.
Kelsey Brown (SFS ’16), captain of the women’s club Ultimate Frisbee team, said that the field had become so dangerous that players were getting injured, forcing the team to change its practices.
“One of our freshmen broke her foot in two places tripping on the turf on Kehoe hill,” Brown said. “It’s so bad that we’ve actually had to alter our practice plans based on what field space we’re using, because when you’re up on Kehoe hill you can’t really do any vigorous activity.”
According to Brown, while the temporary solutions aren’t perfect, in the long term they may be worth it.
“I don’t love the idea of having to travel to an off-campus field, but, that being said [Jelleff field] is close enough and it’s a nice field and we’re going to feel comfortable doing whatever we want on that field, practicing safely on that field,” Brown said. “So if I can get that then, yes, I want that as long as it means that I’m having a more viable long-term solution, sometime within the somewhat near future.”
Matthew Fried (COL ’16), who also plays Ultimate Frisbee, said the loss of Kehoe Field and the manner in which its closure was handled has been frustrating.
“I’ve gone from getting full field space and flexible times to an hour and a half, like, literally we’re out there 10:30 to midnight,” Fried said. “It’s infuriating to me that this was not handled sooner and that there was not some sort of measure in place between closing Kehoe.”
Fried said that no matter what course administration takes on the future of Kehoe Field, it is essential that action be taken quickly.
“The best solution is fast action either way,” Fried said. “One of the frustrating things they said today was that these are the things they’re considering for the next 12 months — that it’s going to take them another 12 months to take action on something like this.”

Georgetown University Women of Color hosted its annual “Race at Georgetown” dialogue in an effort to discuss issues of race and diversity within the larger campus community in the Intercultural Center Auditorium on Tuesday night.
The event was held in conjunction with the “What’s a Hoya?” initiative, focusing on freshman participation, and involved polling and panelists. Approximately 120 audience members were present and able to openly voice their own opinions and questions.
GUWOC is an organization dedicated to providing women of color a space to both gather and network with one another, in addition to providing a platform for the discussion of race and ethnicity.
According to GUWOC Outreach Chair Courtney Maduike (SFS ’17), the event’s theme was “Are You Woke?” The phrase, slang for being socially aware, emphasizes the importance of bridging divides through greater dialogue and awareness.
“I think it’s just the awareness and the fact that the theme for the event for this year is “‘Are You Woke?’”, Maduike said. “It’s this awareness and consciousness that being sympathetic and sensitive to these topics, and building this sense of solidarity and community across these kind of categorizations.”
The event began with opening remarks from moderators Maduike and GUWOC Treasurer Ashlie Williams (MSB ’17), in addition to a video of Yale University students protesting their community’s racial injustices and allegations of discrimination.
Following the video, student panelists Ayo Aruleba (COL ’17), Asha Thanki (SFS ’17), Gilda Gallardo (COL ’17) and Tanner Davis (SFS ’17) presented to the audience their own views on race relations at Georgetown as well as their perspectives on ways for students to enhance the ongoing dialogue.
 
“Working closely with communities of color, but also as a leader, I would say communities of color are trying to bridge the gap,” Aruleba said. “In order to bring sides together, to bring a more inclusive Georgetown community, it’s going to take not only communities of color talking about race. I think everyone has to come to the table.”
Davis emphasized how he became active in dialogue dealing with issues of race and the treatment of minorities after returning from studying abroad.
“I was never really conscious of my race or my whiteness until I studied abroad in [India], and I was a minority there for four months as a white person,” Davis said. “Getting stared at, getting looked at and feeling uncomfortable in social situations, and coming back here after having that experience has really shaped the way I understand how a minority might feel.”
Over the course of the discussion, GUWOC also used a polling system that allowed audience members to answer questions from their phones. Their answers would then subsequently appear on the projector screen in a word cloud with the most popular answers enlarged.
The addition of polling to the overall discussion was part of a broader effort to make sure the dialogue incorporated as much student opinion as possible. Davis explained that discussions on issues of race and discrimination do not happen as often as they should because people can see such dialogues as difficult.
“Having these conversations never really happened in any campus organization I’ve been a part of since I’ve been here,” Davis said. “And when they have, we would talk to each other like ‘This makes us uncomfortable, we don’t want to be talking about this.’”
The panelists continued to explore their own relationship with race-related dialogue, with Gallardo giving an anecdote on how she was treated during a rally in Red Square in November, which called for the name changes of former Mulledy and McSherry Halls, now known as Freedom and Remembrance Halls, respectively.
Gallardo explained how, during a time when students were invited to speak into the microphone and give their own views during the rally, she encountered pushback and criticism.
“I had been the object of critique in one of the classes because I had gone up [to the mic] when they invited people to come forward and share their experiences as minorities with race. The critique was that was not my place or my time to share that experience,” Gallardo said. “I thought that was interesting, but at the same time that invitation was for everybody to share their experiences.”
A student in the audience asked how others could stand with minorities and those facing racial discrimination simply by being active on social media. Aruleba said it is critical for students to read from experts and writers who continue to comment on the issues facing minorities today.
“Especially in this age where there are a lot of movements going on, I would encourage people to do reading on the topics because a part of the movement is being woke,” Aruleba said. “The best advocates of racial justice and the best people to talk on these issues are those who understand, so it’s important to read the discourse on what’s really going on, especially with these issues.”
Thanki said students should move past social media activism by creating tangible change in their communities.
“You can post a status update and still be totally ignorant to the injustices that you see in the world around you,” Thanki said. “So post a status update if you want to, but then take a moment, look around you and see what else you need to do.”
Thanki added that simple acts and efforts on the part of individuals can make significant progress when it comes to assisting those affected by an issue.
“Listen, be genuine and care,” Thanki said. “Those things are so simple-sounding, but the only way to be a true ally, no matter what context, is to hear what people are asking of you instead of not just deciding for yourself what is being asked of you.”
Afras Sial (COL ’19), who attended the event, said he has been involved in dialogues dealing with issues of race and discrimination in the past, but appreciated the value in holding such conversations for those not engaged in the issues.
“I was expecting it to be more structured, for them to have topics specific to Georgetown instead of small anecdotes and large themes,” Sial said. “I didn’t get any new information out of it personally, but it was helpful for people who have not been exposed to the topic before.”
Deniz Yuksel (SFS ’19) said she was happy to see more individuals interact with the topic of race.
“Many people here have their social circles determined by what club they’re in … and friend groups are mostly of the same race, too. It’s bad, and naturally people gravitate to people who look like them,” Yuksel said. “But it’s good that it’s now being noticed, good that people are paying attention to it.”
Winslow Radcliffe-Trenner (SFS ’19) applauded the event’s focus but wished the event itself allowed for more intimate discussion.
“In its objective of making people woke, it was effective because it opened my eyes and the eyes of others to specific issues of racism at Georgetown,” Radcliffe-Trenner said. “But in terms of progressing the conversation, I’m not sure how it went. A conversation has to be a conversation, and there was not really an opportunity to speak back to someone in particular.”
Toward the event’s conclusion, Gallardo emphasized the importance of not being afraid to speak one’s beliefs and engage in issues that may appear difficult at first. She asserted that action needed to be coupled with purpose for effective change to take place.
“Make your beliefs heard. There’s a Japanese proverb: ‘Vision without action is a dream, and action without vision is a nightmare,’” Gallardo said.

“Davis explained that discussions on issues of race and discrimination do not happen as often as they should because people can see such dialogues as difficult.”
It’s not that people see these conversations as difficult, it’s that people don’t see them as dialogues, as opposed to a one-sided “talking to” in which we’re told that everything is white people’s fault, that white people are stupid and bad people who are thieves (just look at Renleigh’s cultural appropriation piece today), and that we should support more affirmative action, more special programs for minorities which are denied to poor white people (even though rich minorities can benefit), more liberal policies, and that we should feel ashamed and responsible for things we haven’t done, that we should shut up unless we’re going to defend the previously stated things, and that we should not complain or speak out when people make fun of us or discriminate against us because of our race.  ‘
There’s a reason why events like the one in this article tend to only have minority groups or white liberals who already agree with the presenters.  It’s because we know better and our time is better spent studying and accomplishing things and having fun with our friends than going to some event where were expected to feel guilty for something we didn’t do and are called racist if we don’t agree with the speakers.  Let’s face it, the biggest dividers on campus are the activist minorities who constantly complain they are oppressed and who demonize white people and instead of trying to make the world a better place for all are constantly demanding special treatment for their tribe.  They’re the ones who make dismissive and derogatory comments toward white people.  We know who they are and what clubs they are in, and when these individuals and and their clubs put on events, we ignore them.  If they were honest and less condescending and students thought they were sincere, and these “dialogues” were actually dialogues, then we might participate more.

University President John J. DeGioia announced a plan for four new commitments designed to address racial injustice and progress for racial equality both on campus and nationally in an address to the community in Lohrfink Auditorium on Thursday afternoon.
DeGioia’s proposed commitments include the proposal for an African American studies department and major, as well as a center for researching racial injustice, a recruitment effort to gather new faculty to support such institutions and the recruitment of a new senior officer to oversee the developments.
“This is the moment to find within each of ourselves, and within our community, the sources of our moral imaginations to determine how we can contribute to responding to this urgent moment in our nation,” DeGioia said.
The address was announced in a university-wide email Wednesday. Throughout his talk, DeGioia noted the significant efforts made to address the university’s history with slavery and racial injustice, including the establishment of the Working Group on Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation in September. However, he acknowledged the need for even more steps to make tangible progress toward racial equality.
“This is a moment for us to say ‘Georgetown is a different place because Georgetown is in the world, which changes and challenges us, and Georgetown has always wished to be engaged in the world,’” DeGioia said.
Following his announcement of the executive board of the College’s decision to establish an African American studies major, DeGioia went on to assert that the university will also establish a department of African American studies. Assisted by University Provost Robert Groves, a working group on racial injustice will be assembled to explore the creation of the department as well as a research center committed to researching racial injustice.
A recruitment effort will be initiated to gather the faculty needed to support both the future department and research center. These initiatives will be handled by a new senior officer, who will directly oversee the commitments while working alongside other senior leadership and research centers.
“These will happen. But we will do this as we do all important and successful work that we have all been a part of here: together, by listening to one another, letting all who can contribute to participate in the new endeavors and working together to achieve our goals,” DeGioia said.
 
[…] the reaction to Mr. DeGioia’s efforts as overwhelmingly positive, pointing out that he is also creating the university’s first department of African-American studies and a center for researching racial […]

Senate Democrats introduced the Reducing Educational Debt Act on Jan. 21 in a campaign to alleviate student debt through a combination of three major bills for which the Democrats have lobbied over the past two years.
The package of bills includes legislation introduced by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in 2014 to allow students to refinance their federal and private loans at a lower interest rate. Further, the act includes a proposal from Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) initiated in 2015 that aims to ensure government aid covers more of the cost of college by indexing future Pell Grant awards to inflation.
The Democrat leaders who support this act are also using it to restate their endorsement of President Barack Obama’s call to make community college free. Obama’s motion is based on the America’s College Promise Act of 2015, introduced by Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) to provide a federal match of 3 dollars for every dollar the state provides to waive tuition for eligible students. If all states participate, up to 9 million community college students could save an average of $3,800 in tuition each year.
Director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce Anthony Carnevale said ensuring that young people receive a college education is paramount to the United States’ continued international success. He emphasized a need for change, noting that the United States has fallen behind other advanced nations in educational achievement.
“We know that one of the major problems holding back growth in the American economy has been our inability to produce a quality labor force on par with other nations,” Carnevale said. “The U.S. is 13th … in the world in terms of our ability to graduate people from two-year or four-year colleges.”
Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming also expressed support for most of the act’s components, highlighting the section allowing students to refinance their loans. He noted that Georgetown students on average have lower student loan amounts and one of the lowest default rates of any university in the country.
“It is only common sense that students should be able to refinance their student loan debt,” Fleming said. “Why this interest rate should be locked in forever doesn’t make a lot of sense. Certainly it would make it possible for students to pay off their loans even sooner.”
Fleming explained that the section of the act that would allow for free community college will be difficult to pass due to its sheer cost. In addition, if the federal budget were to increase to enable more students to attend community college, it is possible that this would leave less funding for federal loans that many Georgetown students depend on.
“The challenge with the proposal is to think about it in the overall context of the federal budget,” Fleming said. “There is reason to make sure that it … would not squeeze out money for other important programs that are important to the university.”
Carnevale also noted that this year’s increased expenditures on elderly care and national defense would hamper Congress’ ability to pay for the measures proposed in the bill. He was doubtful that any bill would be passed this year that would fundamentally alter how students pay for higher education.
“In other times, the [act] is a very good investment and we should be spending more money on this because the returns are high,” Carnevale said. “The problem is, we don’t have the money to spend and this is where all the proposals begin to get doubtful.”
Fleming expressed concern about the congressional leaders’ attempt to simplify loan and grant programs by centralizing them under federal programs such as Pell Grants and Federal Stafford Loans. As a result, he said, federal grant and loan programs such as the Federal Perkins Loan Program and the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants on which some Georgetown students depend might be discontinued.
“The leaders in both bodies have come out in support of what they call ‘student financial aid simplification,’” Fleming said. “[But] what their simplification programs say is that there should be one federal grant program and one federal loan program.”
Carnevale explained that the federal government should also focus on providing information regarding the value of particular fields of study to students, potentially making their decision on which college to attend easier. This would include the publication of research that examines the job prospects for each major and area of study offered in specific schools.
“We want to ensure value and efficiency in higher education,” Carnevale said. “We [should] demand that every college tell their students…what the likelihood is of getting a job and how much money they’re going to make.”
Vice Chair of the College Democrats Aditya Pande (SFS ’18), head of the club’s Higher Education and Economics Working Group, voiced support for these solutions as a way to combat growing problems in higher education. Pande argued that the ability to refinance student loans is a necessity for borrowers.
“Refinancing is critical,” Pande said. “With interest rates so low, it is absurd to think that people who have taken out loans from the federal government would not be able to refinance them at a market rate of interest.”
Pande highlighted the importance of a college education in allowing citizens to be competitive in today’s economy, which is something this bill would allow.
“We want people to have access to tools that will enable them to improve their lives,” Pande said. “If we’re serious about improving people’s life prospects, free community college is something we should do.”

Over 300,000 people turned out to vote at the Iowa caucus Feb. 1, kicking off the 2016 presidential election season with wins for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, prompting student activists to voice their predictions for an increasingly uncertain election.
The Iowa caucus differs from other state primaries in that in each of the state’s 1,682 precincts, voters gather in small locations to cast their votes. Based on these votes, Iowa then allocates delegates to each candidate.
On the Republican side, Cruz won with eight delegates and 27.6 percent of the votes, followed by Donald Trump who garnered 24.3 percent of the vote. Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) were each allocated seven delegates, with Rubio coming in third with 23.1 percent of the vote.
Institute of Politics and Public Service Fellow Patrick Dillon (COL ’99), former deputy White House political director and special assistant to President Barack Obama, emphasized the importance of outreach and voter engagement in ensuring caucus victory.
“I think the caucuses did what they were supposed to do: reward candidates who did the work to get to know voters and build a real organization on the ground,” Dillon wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It wasn’t about who ran the most TV ads or who had the biggest rallies, but about who focused their campaign on field outreach and engaging their supporters.”
Dillon highlighted the strategies employed by Cruz and Clinton that resulted in their eventual victories.
“Cruz beat Trump in part by going county to county and tapping into evangelical leaders who could speak for him everywhere,” Dillon wrote. “For Clinton, in a state almost tailor made for Bernie Sanders to be successful, her deep and strong field organization made all the difference in holding off such a stiff challenge.”
Chairwoman of Georgetown Students for Rubio Alexandra Williams (SFS ’19) said she is pleased with Rubio’s performance in the caucus, adding that she was surprised to see the narrow difference between the percentages of votes won by Rubio and Trump.
“We expected a strong third place but we had no idea he would be so close to second place. That means going forward to New Hampshire, Rubio has an amazing chance,” Williams said. “His momentum has been growing, and although New Hampshire is potentially a more libertarian state, which could harm him, I think he’s going to do well.”
Williams went on to predict that Rubio will continue to do well in the New Hampshire primary Tuesday.
“He’s achieved third in Iowa and now he just needs to get second in New Hampshire. I think he has a great chance going forward,” Williams said. “All the polls you look at, he’s the only one predicted to defeat Hillary Clinton, so we’re optimistic.”
Of the other nine Republican candidates, Ben Carson took third place with 9.3 percent of voters and won three delegates. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Chief Executive Officer of Hewlett-Packard Carly Fiorina and former Governor of Ohio John Kasich each garnered less than five percent of the vote and were allocated one delegate.
During the caucus, former Governor of Maryland Martin O’Malley and former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee suspended their campaigns. Following the release of the caucus results, Sen. Paul and former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) announced the suspension of their campaigns Tuesday.
In a statement released Wednesday morning, Paul said that although he is no longer running for president, he will continue to fight for liberty in his position as senator.
“Although, today I will suspend my campaign for President, the fight is far from over. Today, I will end where I began, ready and willing to fight for the cause of liberty,” Paul said. “I will continue to carry the torch for Liberty in the United States Senate and I look forward to earning the privilege to represent the people of Kentucky for another term.”
In 2012, Santorum won the Iowa caucuses and came in second overall to eventual Republican nominee Mitt Romney. Following the suspension of his campaign, Santorum announced his endorsement of Rubio for president on Fox News’ “On the Record” Wednesday night.
Santorum said that he has decided that the best way to achieve the goals he set out to accomplish would be to end his campaign.
“I think we could be better advocates for that in supporting someone who shared those values and is in a better position to do well in this race,” Santorum said. “That’s why we decided to support Marco Rubio.”
The Democratic candidates saw a tighter race, with Clinton ultimately winning 49.9 percent of votes and 23 delegates and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) garnering 49.6 percent and 21 delegates. In Clinton’s victory speech, she highlighted the importance of solidarity within the Democratic party. “I am a progressive who gets things done for people. We have to be united when it is all said and done. We have to be united when it is all said and done against a Republican vision and candidates who would drive us apart and divide us,” Clinton said. “That’s not who we are, my friends.” Former Georgetown University College Democrats Executive Board Member Scott Lowder (COL ’17) said that he understood why Sanders did so well in Iowa, but that he did not expect Sanders to do as well in other states.
“Going into the election, the polls were very close. I think people are realizing that Bernie Sanders was really well-suited to the state, because it was overwhelmingly liberal and white,” Lowder said. “I think in more diverse states, like Nevada and South Carolina, Bernie doesn’t stand a chance.”

Members of the Georgetown delegation to the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, also known as COP21, discussed their experience and optimism for the new climate deal with the Georgetown community at an event Monday afternoon in the Mortara Center titled, “What Happened in Paris?”
The discussion was part of the Energy and Climate Policy Research Seminar, a program that encourages dialogue between students and faculty on the topics of international and domestic energy and climate change policy.
The delegation that traveled to Paris for the conference included Associate Professor of Science, Technology and International Affairs in the School of Foreign Service Joanna Lewis, Executive Director of the Georgetown Climate Center Vicki Arroyo and students Norah Berk (SFS ’15) and Alexandra Donovan (SFS ’17).
Lewis began the event by addressing the delegation and mainstream climate movement’s mixed reviews of COP21; some have deemed it a landmark achievement while others contest it will not solve climate change.
“I absolutely agree that this is not going to solve climate change but I think this is an extremely important step because we didn’t have a global platform to talk about solving climate change really until this agreement,” Lewis said.
Lewis outlined key factors that have shifted since the Kyoto Protocol was agreed upon., and making the Paris agreement possible, including the lack of country categories, groupings that exist to list countries together by their economic status and emissions targets,and the creation of targets through a bottom-up process, as opposed to a top-down process.
“Bottom-up means each country can look at their own economy and resources and they can say, ‘Well, we may not be able to cap our emissions today but I think we can accelerate a reduction, we can accelerate using renewable energy, we can slow deforestation,’” Lewis said. “So you see that these pledges that countries put forward are very nationally tailored to their circumstances, which ends up working better and getting more participation.”
Lewis attributed the negotiations’ success to the substantially evolved and improved relations between the United States and China as a result of regular meetings and bilateral discussions on climate change.
“Last November, the joint U.S.-China announcement on climate change paved the way for the targets that countries ended up agreeing on in Paris, and the language in that joint agreement ended up mobilizing a lot of the developing world and it led to a more comprehensive agreement,” Lewis said.
Arroyo said the inclusion of countries, businesses, investors, states and equivalent local people resulted in 196 countries joining together and committing to the final agreement, an improvement from past climate talks in Copenhagen in 2009 that ended with virtually no lasting progress.
“It’s not what we need to stay within the two degree Celsius [warming limit],” Arroyo said. “But for the first time you see everybody playing a role, everybody pulling together in the same direction, instead of the finger pointing that we had seen after Copenhagen.”
Arroyo attributed part of the success at COP21 to the intense role of sub-national actors, including nearly 1,000 mayors, governors and other subnational officials from around the world who took part in discussions.
“You see governors or mayors taking time out of their busy schedules, dealing with day-to-day crises, willing to come and talk about something like climate change because they are on the front lines,” Arroyo said.
Arroyo praised President Obama’s climate speech at Georgetown for providing momentum for COP21.
“He set the course for major reductions in this country … really using the full administrative authority of the White House and other agencies to support both reductions in green house gases but also to promote resilience,” Arroyo said. “It really was a turning point in my mind in terms of being able to see the kind of leadership federally which also influences international negotiations.”
Arroyo said although the Paris climate conference was a success, there is still a long road ahead.
“We arrived to 70 degree temperatures in mid-December here in D.C. and realized, ‘Wow, we need to get back to work,’” Arroyo said.
Donovan, a current Georgetown student who attended the conference while abroad in Paris, was impressed by the diversity of representatives at COP21.
“I was struck by how there were so many people there that were so passionate about the same subject. Everyone brought a unique perspective.”
Joan Abbott (SFS ’16) said it was important for students, specifically STIA majors, to attend this event and learn about the intersection of environmental policy and international relations.
“Not every STIA major is necessarily a climate person and I think it’s important that students come and hear about the current events,” Abbott said. “People are focused on the science but they don’t realize the importance of the negotiations and how delicate those situations are.”
Leyla Jiang (GRD ’17) said she was encouraged by the positive outlook the speakers had after attending COP21.
“From my experience views about climate change deals are more negative, criticizing how pragmatic this deal is but being here and listening to [the speakers’] experiences in Paris, it gives me this hope because I believe everyone who is here is very committed to this problem … it motivates you to stay in this business,” Jiang said.

The Georgetown University Student Association senate approved a resolution to hold a campus-wide referendum to gauge student opinions on changes to the course registration procedure in a vote to be held digitally during the GUSA executive elections Feb. 18.
Approved on Jan. 24, the resolution authorizes the GUSA Election Commission to place the following question on the ballot during the ongoing election cycle: “Would you rather keep pre-registration or switch to live registration?” The approved responses are “keep pre-registration,” “switch to live registration” and “no preference.”
The move follows the announcement by former Registrar John Q. Pierce at a GUSA town hall in December that the university was considering upgrading its registration software to the Banner 9 system that uses live registration.
According to GUSA Senator for the LXR district Michael Fiedorowicz (COL ’18), one of the co-sponsors of the resolution, the goal of the referendum is to quantify student views on a possible move to live registration next year.
“We knew that the administration was considering a switch in the registration system so we wanted to be certain of student opinion on the issue,” Fiedorowicz said. “This was the right time for the referendum because the current registrar has stepped down and his replacement will be coming in over the summer, and we’ll be ready to tell them what students think about this.”
According to GUSA Election Commissioner Grady Willard (SFS ’18), the idea for a referendum on course registration originated at the GUSA town hall in December.
“He said that the program that Georgetown uses for its registration is upgrading, and that they are trying to figure what they want to do over the next two years,” Willard said.
One possibility would be to transition to live registration, which would stagger entry to courses by class year and leave courses open in a first-come, first-serve manner within the time given to register. Seats would be reserved in specific classes for majors and underclassmen.
According to Fiedorowicz, live registration would also create specific class sections based on projections of interests that would come from four-year degree plans students previously determined before registering.
The alternative is to keep the preregistration system. Under the current model, course registration staggers distribution of who gets their classes first by class year and major. Upperclassmen who have declared majors in a certain field get their first class first, followed by senior and junior non-majors down to freshmen. The deans are able to adjust class sizes based on preliminary interest.
In an article in The Hoya (“University Considers Live Registration,” Dec. 8, 2015), Pierce said he believed live registration could be a better solution.
“We think the [Banner 9] registration process might be actually better. It would facilitate the mobile app, and if we went to cloud computing where we didn’t have to invest so much money in it … it would cost less to maintain it and thus keep tuition dollars down,” Pierce said.
According to members of the GUSA senate, both models have advantages.
“I personally believe that there are more positives to pre-registration, because students are able to take their time and carefully craft their classes to meet their needs,” GUSA Senator for Alumni Square & Nevils Roopa Mulpuri (SFS ’18) and the second co-sponsor of the referendum resolution said. “However, live registration does provide instant feedback and speeds up the lengthy process considerably.”
GUSA Senator for the Village A district Samantha Granville (COL ’17) said that her previous experience with live registration makes the proposed switch less daunting.
“The school I transferred from had live registration, so for me, it is not that scary,” she said. “We will still have plenty of time to check out the schedule of classes before we have to decide what we want.”
Granville said she also believes the live registration process would alleviate the prolonged waiting times in the current system.
“I like live registration because I know immediately what classes will be available when I sign up and can watch movement in classes on my own time rather than waiting to see what is open with pre-registration,” she said. “The process is also a lot quicker and not dragged out for six weeks.”
GUSA President Joe Luther (COL ’16) said pre-registration has more benefits for students than live registration.
“Personally, I think pre-registration has more to offer students. I can see the appeal of live registration, but I think there is a lot that can be lost in the chaos of live registration,” Luther said. “I understand that there are some financial hurdles to the preregistration model, but I do think that it’s a worthy investment.”
Both GUSA executive tickets believe that student interests should be placed first.
According to Speaker of the Senate Enushe Khan (MSB ’17), a GUSA presidential candidate, Georgetown’s use of pre-registration is fairer than live registration.
“A lot of other schools have live registration where everyone logs on at the same time,” she said. “It’s a first-come, first-serve scramble, which is not as fair of a system.”
A.J. Serlemitsos (COL ’17), GUSA vice presidential candidate, said he hopes that the results of the referendum will facilitate discussion with university administrators.
“Anything that helps students get better matched with the classes they want to take is something that we support,” he said. “And if the university believes that they have found the solution here, we would work with them to make the process as simple as possible for all students.”
The Intellectual Life Committee of the Senate will be leading a two-week information campaign until the Executive Election.
Mulpuri stressed the importance that students vote in the referendum.
“It’s a complex issue that I highly encourage everyone to become educated about and to cast their vote in the referendum on February 18th. We, as GUSA senators, have a responsibility to advocate for the students on this topic, whatever it may turn out to be,” Mulpuri said.

The Council of the District of Columbia unexpectedly tabled a bill initiated by Mayor Muriel Bowser to permanently ban private cannabis clubs Tuesday, unanimously agreeing to uphold a temporary ban lasting no more than 225 days.
The ban includes an amendment establishing a seven-member task force that will investigate the feasibility of allowing cannabis clubs in the District.
Under current D.C. law, possession of marijuana is legal in quantities of up to two ounces for adults aged 21 or above. However, pot consumption is prohibited in all areas open to the public, including private bars, restaurants and social cannabis clubs, leaving few possibilities for pot usage beyond one’s residence.
Bowser currently reserves the right to revoke the business license or certificate of occupancy of any establishment that knowingly services patrons who use the drug on its premises. Advocates of citywide marijuana use argue that the ban restricts marijuana consumers who do not wish to use the substance in front of their children or whose rental leases forbid pot usage.
Drug Policy Alliance policy associate Kaitlyn Boecker said that removing the city’s restriction on pot clubs would permit lower-income families to assume the same rights as their wealthier counterparts. Since only 19 percent of D.C.’s poorest residents own their own homes, Boecker argued that rental leases forbidding marijuana consumption disproportionately affect lower-income people.
“The city is basically telling these residents that you have the right to use marijuana, but they’re not going to give you any space to do so, so basically they’re forcing you to risk doing pot in the street and get arrested,” Boecker said. “It’s an untenable situation, and it’s not a good public policy decision. You should not tell people that something is legal and then not give them the space to enjoy that right.”
The decision follows a series of reversed council rulings and congressional restraints that have dogged marijuana legislation in the District since Initiative 71 first passed. After roughly 65 percent of voters approved decriminalization, Congress passed an omnibus spending bill in December 2014 for D.C. that forbade the allocation of any District funds to enacting laws or regulations to legalize or otherwise reduce penalties for marijuana possession or consumption.
With limited latitude in regulating marijuana without resorting to reserve funds, Bowser proposed emergency legislation in February 2015 to bar pot usage in private cannabis clubs, resulting in a temporary ban. The D.C. Council considered instituting a permanent ban as the legislation was set to expire on Jan. 15, but deliberations for the bill have been postponed as a result of the unanimous vote Feb. 2.
The newly established task force, which includes representatives from the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration, the Department of Health and the Metropolitan Police Department, will issue a report within 120 days advising a course of action for the D.C. Council.
Adam Eidinger, a marijuana advocate who spearheaded the successful November 2014 referendum that legalized pot through Initiative 71, said that, although he wishes the task force included members of the cannabis user community, he views the council’s decision as a victory for pot proponents.
“It’s beautiful that not a single councilmember wanted to oppose this,” Eidinger said. “I would be very surprised if what came out of this task force is a recommendation that we cannot do pot clubs here in D.C. We wouldn’t even have a task force if they didn’t think this was a reasonable thing to try and figure out.”
Boecker added that she hopes the task force will examine existing models of cannabis clubs in Alaska, Colorado, Spain and the Netherlands during its research.
“There are a lot of models that this task force can explore and our hope is that it will get them to take a thoughtful, studied, public policy approach to this,” Boecker said. “I think it’s fairly clear that we need these spaces and these spaces will allow like-minded people to legally congregate.”
The Mayor’s Office declined to comment but affirmed that it is reviewing the council’s proposal and working with stakeholders on both sides of the issue.
Founder and President of Georgetown Students for D.C. Statehood Annie Mason (COL ’16) said Congress’ involvement in D.C.’s marijuana legislation has warped the execution of Initiative 71.
“All of the legal issues surrounding marijuana policy in D.C. would be resolved if Congress affirmed D.C.’s ability to govern itself and the U.S. ratified an amendment to establish D.C. as a state,” Mason wrote in an email The Hoya. “Initiative 71 was passed with well over a majority of the vote, but certain members of Congress acted paternalistically and not in the best interest of D.C. residents to try and prevent the efficient and reasonable implementation of policies outlined in Initiative 71.”
Georgetown has maintained a zero-tolerance policy toward marijuana despite its legalization in the District. The Code of Student Conduct expressly prohibits the possession, use, manufacture or distribution of marijuana.
Celine Calpo (COL ’19) said that D.C. should investigate integrating marijuana use into existing drug locales in the city.
“The definition of what the city considers public and private is very problematic,” Calpo said. “I don’t see why the city can’t regulate cannabis clubs in the same way that it does in hookah bars or vape lounges, where there are legal psychoactive substances but they’re in a controlled environment.”

D.C. Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large) introduced the Protecting Students Digital Privacy Act of 2016 on Jan. 19, which seeks to provide D.C. Public Schools students with additional security and independence when using both school-owned and personal devices.
When Grosso introduced the bill at a D.C. City Council meeting, he said that the bill presents a response to certain challenges that have emerged as technology becomes more active in schools.
Grosso emphasized that lawmakers should push back against school administrators who attempt to use their positions to violate student privacy by tracking their digital movements. Grosso also mentioned the American Civil Liberties Union’s desire to further protect students. The ACLU is a nonprofit that seeks to preserve individual civil rights and liberties and has publically supported Grosso’s bill and those similar to it across the country.
“There’s a push nationally by the ACLU and others to try to do a better job protecting students’ privacy when it comes to electronic devices,” Grosso said. “States and other cities are taking a similar approach where we’re trying to protect this information.”
The bill has multiple components that would establish greater levels of freedom for DCPS students. It would require that any agency that agrees to hold or process student data must implement appropriate security measures such as notifying students and their guardians in cases of a security breach.
The bill would also ensure schools that provide students with technological devices for home use are only able to track or store data that is not considered personally identifiable for a given student. Under this provision, schools will only be able to track how devices are being used and will not have access to student-specific information.
Grosso stressed the importance of these provisions in allowing students more freedom in their personal use of devices.
“Students have been researching something on a computer or trying to engage in political debate on their Twitter account…and have then been basically reprimanded by the schools,” Grosso said. “That, we believe, is hindering free speech in a way that we don’t want to support.”
The final element of the bill would prohibit schools from requiring students to provide usernames and passwords for personal social media accounts. In addition, it would forbid school employees from requesting data stored on a student’s personal technological device. However, the bill does allow these provisions to be waived in certain circumstances, such as cases in which a student is suspected of illegal activity or constitutes a direct threat to school safety.
Georgetown University Law Center Professor Paul Ohm said that he sees Grosso’s bill as a step in the right direction for protecting local students. Students’ online civil rights are not protected by federal oversight because of multiple loopholes in the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act written in 1974, long before the advent of social media and personal portable laptop computers.
“We have a federal privacy law for students called FERPA, but it has a lot of loopholes and limitations largely because it predated so much information technology,” Ohm said. “FERPA is really uncertain about privacy protections in the context of inviting Google and other companies into the classroom, and so I think this law is addressing that.”
Ohm emphasized the importance of the bill in addressing this lack of comprehensive legislation on privacy protection.
“It’s no secret that we live in a time when the federal legislation in Congress can get very little done, and this is especially true with privacy,” Ohm said. “There hasn’t been a major privacy law in over a decade at the federal level. This represents states, and in this case the D.C. government, trying to do what Congress hasn’t been able to do in a fairly measured way. This isn’t sweeping law, but it’s sensible and it does good things.”
Grosso similarly highlighted a lack of federal protection as one of the factors behind the introduction of the bill, stating that since the federal government was unable to come to a consensus on the issue, it was up to local lawmakers to do so.
“We were trying to line up with a national movement on this,” Grosso said. “There’s been some push in the federal government and they’ve gotten nowhere with it, so we decided that it was important to do this on a local basis.”
ACLU-D.C. Executive Director Monica Hopkins-Maxwell emphasized the organization’s support for the bill in a press release published Jan. 20, arguing that students’ privacy should be protected and free from violation by school administrators.
“Every person should have the power to decide who they want to share personal, private information with. Privacy is not about keeping secrets; it is about exercising control over our own lives,” Hopkins-Maxwell said. “We’re grateful to Councilmember Grosso for his efforts, which affirm that privacy remains a core value in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States of America.”

The Office of the Student Worker Advocate has sponsored an ongoing survey to determine the needs and concerns of student workers in the Georgetown community to help inform university administrators as they make decisions affecting student workers, including the potential consolidation of Residence Hall Offices mailrooms into one facility.
Originally created in 2014 to work under the Office of the Student Worker Advocate branch, OSWA counsels students who have labor issues and connects employees to appropriate resources and offices.
To help fulfill these responsibilities, OSWA is conducting its annual survey, called, “The State of the GU Student Worker,” to gauge student worker conditions.
Cassidy Jensen (COL ’18), OSWA co-chair and one of the survey creators, said the survey will provide hard data to bring to the administration.
“It’s really important to us for people to fill this out so that we have the fullest picture and most accurate data,” Jensen said. “If we are going to the administration and saying, ‘look, this is a problem, for this many people, who use their money is these ways,’ it’s helpful to have as many responses as possible.”
According to Jensen, OSWA also hopes to determine where to focus resources moving forward.
This year’s survey features an entire section devoted to collecting information on RHO employees, in response to recent proposals by university administration within Auxiliary Business Services to consolidate RHO mailrooms.
“We would have one giant center and students would go there to pick up their mail,” OSWA co-chair Esmeralda Huerta (SFS ’17) said. “The reasoning for this is that mail trucks clog up traffic around Georgetown, but in any case, we realized it could mean a lot of job losses for students.”
Jensen said OSWA is collecting data to see how this change could impact student workers.
“We are operating under the assumption that if it takes place, it will have some impact on student jobs,” Jensen said. “We want to know who is working in the RHOs, if they are work study and if they will be able to find other work study jobs on campus.”
According to Huerta, OSWA hopes to use the survey results to estimate the number of students who will be affected and how their incomes will be affected by a sudden loss of federal work-study jobs.
“Hopefully we can go to the university and say, ‘Hey, you shouldn’t do this. You’re going to affect this many students in this many ways, and as a university, your primary concern should be the students and not necessarily clogging up traffic in the neighborhood,’” Huerta said.
With the survey, OSWA also seeks to learn how the minimum wage increase in the District has impacted student wages, primarily library workers.
“Student workers in the library used to receive wage increases each semester they worked there. Now there’s a different system because of the minimum wage increase,” Jensen said. “Library workers are trying to fight that and want a return to the old system. We’re trying to see if that is happening anywhere else.”
Apart from the RHO and library wage concerns, Jensen said they hope they can learn if student workers know what resources are available to them and what other issues concern workers.
“We want to know if they are having a problem with a supervisor, if they are experiencing sexual harassment, if they have a question about their duties or are paid consistently late, that they know who to go to,” Jensen said. “It’s good feedback for us and for the Student Employment Office.”
Huerta said the data from previous surveys has been helpful in addressing student concerns in the past.
“One of the facts we realized was that around 70 percent of students weren’t going to the [Student Employment Office] even when they had problems,” Huerta said. “There was a disparity between what’s going on with student employment and access to resources.”
In response to the first survey in 2014, OSWA organized a committee with the SEO to publish a student worker handbook for hourly employees to consolidate rights, responsibilities and codes of conduct for students over the following spring and summer semesters.
According to Huerta, this year’s survey has been adapted after having conversations with student workers and observing campus trends.
Kyle Rinaudo (SFS ’18), an RHO worker in Copley Hall and a Resident Assistant, said he is aware and appreciative of the support offered to him by Georgetown.
“I do love working with the school and have never felt anything but supported by them,” Rinaudo said. “Other than the way my RA benefits are calculated into financial aid, I have no complaints. As for the resources I would need, I theoretically know who to reach out to.”
New South RHO Manager Raven Dunstan (COL ’16) said she has always felt supported as a student worker at Georgetown.
“Personally, I am aware of resources that I could reach out to if I encountered any difficulties in my capacity as a student worker,” she said. “I have always felt supported within my position and for this reason I have felt comfortable working for the university for my four years here.”

Professor emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study Michael Walzer advocated for swift action to end the ongoing crisis in Syria on humanitarian grounds at a lecture for around 150 students and faculty in Copley Formal Lounge on Tuesday. The lecture, entitled “What is the Responsibility to Protect?” was the 2016 Sullivan Lecture, an annual lecture focused on current developments in the fields of government and law.
Chair of Georgetown’s department of government Charles King emphasized the importance of the Sullivan Lecture, which is made possible by an endowment from Daniel and Sheila Sullivan. The endowment supports and promotes the study of ethics in government, law and other professions along with the annual lecture.
“We are very proud of the long tradition at Georgetown of integrating the normative study of political theory with the empirical study of institutions and behavior, a fundamental union that too often in political science today has been allowed to weaken,” King said.
After an introduction from assistant professor at the department of government Joshua Cherniss, Walzer began by explaining how the conflict within Syria — stemming from a civilian uprising against dictator Bashar Al-Assad in 2011 — is complex and that identifying a plausible solution is difficult.
“This is a hard case and I know the maxim that hard cases make bad law, but I don’t think that maxim holds for political theory,” Walzer said. “At least I shall proceed under the view that hard cases make for better, or at any rate, more realistic, theories.”
Walzer emphasized that his views on the Syrian situation have evolved over the years. During the lecture, he read from blogs he wrote over the course of the conflict, commenting on their applicability in light of current events.
In one post from 2012, Walzer expressed how, if unprepared or not forceful enough, any intervention in Syria would be rendered useless without physical ground troops. Otherwise, no effectual gains would be made.
“I can’t see any of these requirements being met without an intervention that puts foreign boots on the ground, and at this moment everyone wants a quick fix, weapons in the hands of the opposition, but which opposition and air strikes against Syrian military bases?” Walzer said.
Walzer said that deep contemplation of the ramifications of a humanitarian intervention is the only course of action.
“Many people have been criticizing President Obama for dithering over what to do in Syria. Not me; dithering seems an entirely rational response to what’s going on there,” Walzer said.
The last blog post Walzer referenced was from October 2013. In the article, he posited that perhaps his previous statements against American intervention in Syria were wrong. With two million Syrians having fled the country, he read how it was not the right choice to oppose American intervention in Syria.
“Many of us who opposed an American intervention in Syria argued from the example of Iraq … the U.S. invasion produced a disaster in Iraq, millions of people displaced outside the country and inside too,” Walzer said. “The most common argument from the left was simply that the U.S. must simply not do anything like that again. Well the U.S. didn’t, yet disaster has struck Syria on an even greater scale.”
Walzer next explored how the debate on Syria has brought to light an important doctrine, “The Responsibility to Protect.”
Included within the Outcome Document accepted by the United Nations General Assembly during the 2005 World Summit, R2P allows the U.N. Security Council to authorize force under certain conditions. If a country fails to protect its nationals from genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity, then the U.N. can vote to carry out the use of force in such countries.
While he appreciated the symbolism of R2P, Walzer stressed how it is distinct from other military action since it is not enforced in cases of ordinary brutality by authoritarian governments or in cases of civil war. He argued how as the conflict within Syria is seen as a civil war, an R2P response has yet to take place.
“Syria today cannot be described in a singular way. There is a civil war, there is tyranny, there is a war of all against all with terrifying consequences for the civilian population, and there is a religious crusade,” Walzer said. “Any intervention would have to be with all of these, which is why it can’t be aimed only with ending the brutality by overthrowing the tyrant.”
According to Walzer, the best actors to take on the job of intervention are neighboring countries, including Turkey and the Arab states. Yet making tangible progress towards peace is unfeasible if both Turkey and the region do not receive the necessary backing from other powerful allies and the U.N.
“‘Whoever can, should,’ is still the relevant maxim. Local responses from relevant actors are probably best,” Walzer continued. “Sometimes the most suitable responder is the old imperial power which may well bear some responsibility for the violence and the victims.”
David Golemboski and Alexandra Stark, doctoral candidates in the department of government, both said they enjoyed the lecture and particularly appreciated the chance to hear from a leader in the field of political science.
“He’s obviously a legend in the field of political theory and in the world of political science, and it’s a pleasure to hear him speak,” Golemboski said. “He does a nice job of wrangling a bunch of moral considerations into a nice package, not necessarily any clearer in regards to coming up with an answer, but helpful in terms of thinking through hard problems.”
Stark agreed.
“It was fascinating to have such a well known and prestigious just-war scholar, to be able to hear his thoughts firsthand, and to ask questions and interact with him,” Stark said.
Cameron Bean (SFS ’18) said he was struck by the opportunity to hear from one of the political scientists often cited in their class, saying that Walzer’s talking points and ideas made an impression on him.
“It was great to hear from the author of one of the books that I’m reading for one of my classes and to be able to get his thoughts on a current issue. It was really powerful,” Bean said.

Congressman Chris Gibson (R-N.Y.) explained the guiding principles of his personal decision-making in office, focusing specifically on how it applies to issues of economic reform and national defense, at an event in Healy Hall on Tuesday
The event, which was co-hosted by the Georgetown University College Republicans and the GU Student Veterans Association, saw Gibson emphasize three major policy points: growing the American economy, drafting a balanced budget and maintaining a strong national defense.
After 29 years of military service, Gibson was elected the U.S. Representative of New York’s 19th Congressional District in 2012.
Gibson currently serves on the House Agriculture, Armed Services and Small Business Committees. He said that he follows two principles to guide his votes on any bills under consideration: whether the bill is constitutional and whether or not it benefits his constituents.
“If the answer is yes to both, then I support it, I vote for it,” Gibson said. “If it’s no to one of the two, then I don’t.”
Regarding his principles, Gibson said that his colleagues have learned to respect his firmness. He further stated that once he makes a decision, the House Republican leadership does not pressure him to change his mind.
“My leadership know that if I say no, I mean no, if I say, yes, I mean yes,” Gibson said. “That means they can count on me even when it gets really hard and I’ll be there with them.”
Gibson said he supports reforming the current health care system to reduce costs and benefit the economy. Currently, the World Bank reported that health care spending by the U.S. government occurs at a level of 17 percent of the United States’ gross domestic product, which Gibson wants to bring down to 3 percent. Gibson also said he backs the easing of regulations for small businesses, which he says suffer under the present system.
“Our small business owners today often get fatigued [by regulatory policies],” Gibson said. “They have a great idea and then they’ll actually walk away from it before they get it started and then for those existing businesses, [the ideas] often get forgotten.”
Gibson said he gave up his military pension before making monetary cuts in his district in order not to give a poor impression of hypocrisy to his voters. Gibson relates his legislative mentality to his experience as a soldier and the sacrifices that one must make when being part of a team.
“Just like when I was an infantry leader, I knew I was going to have to make some hard calls and I wanted to be the first one to take the cut,” Gibson said. “That was important for having the kind of moral legitimacy that we can make these hard calls.”
On the issue of national defense, Gibson asserted his philosophy as one that emphasizes defense spending and is willing to use force if necessary. Gibson noted that the United States should always carefully weigh its options before committing to a major use of force.
“I am a classical conservative when it comes to national security. I believe in peace through strength,” Gibson said. “I’ve fought and bled for this country, but I think that we’ve been too quick to use force.”
In response to the threat of the Islamic State group, Gibson advocated for United States support of all Muslim allies in the region. Specifically, he advocates openly arming the Kurds to fight ISIS militants, as a stronger U.S. presence in the region might undermine the recruitment capabilities of ISIS.
“This enemy is essentially fraudulent,” Gibson said. “They claim they’re advancing the cause of Muslims; nothing could be further from the truth. They kill more Muslims than anyone else.”
Director of Campus Affairs for the GU College Republicans Allie Williams (SFS ’19) wrote that Gibson’s commitment to principles sets him apart from other politicians.
“It was extremely refreshing to hear from a politician who is more concerned with ensuring the best outcome for the citizens of his district than simply pandering to his party,” Williams wrote in an email to The Hoya. “[That] is all too common today.”
Mark Henderson (COL ’17), a member of Georgetown University Student Veterans Association who attended the event, conveyed his admiration for Gibson. Henderson has a personal connection to Gibson, as he served under him in the military and at his office in Congress.
“Having served under Colonel Gibson as a paratrooper and Congressman Gibson as an intern, I’ve been fortunate to witness the caliber of his leadership firsthand,” Henderson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “People should know that he is genuine, and I believe our system could use more of his moderate voice of reason.”
Grace Smith (COL ’18), a resident of Gibson’s district who also attended the event, expressed her appreciation for his work. Despite the fact that she has different political views from Gibson, Smith still respects the efforts made on his part for his constituents.
“Although I am a loyal and proud Democrat, I really respect him and the work he has done,” Smith wrote in an email to The Hoya. “He has served upstate New York well, and I am humbled to be his constituent.”

Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce released its new State Initiative, a web portal housing CEW’s past research on all 50 states and Washington, D.C., on Jan. 21. The new program is designed for state officials and policymakers to easily access data and information to supplement future policy decisions.
CEW was formed in 2008. Affiliated with the McCourt School of Public Policy, the center’s research focuses on understanding the interactions between education and the workforce while seeking to inform policymakers at local, state and national levels.
The State Initiative follows the CEW’s efforts to seek out better ways to accommodate policymakers looking to utilize data collected in past research. The initiative signals CEW’s commitment to making its research more widely available and easier to access as states seek better data to better inform policy decisions.
“We were approached by several governors and the National Governor’s Association over the years to help with building information systems for more effective public higher education management. This helped spearhead this project,” CEW Director Anthony Carnevale wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Over the course of a year, Carnevale desired to see CEW’s research not only inform current education systems, but also influence organizations and institutions within states to conduct their own research.
State Initiative Director Neil Ridley was tasked with building the program in order to influence the research and policy efforts conducted by individual states.
“Ideally, it would be good to see state officials as well as higher education systems using education data more extensively, more intensively than they are now,” Ridley said. “That involves using the research our scholars produce, but that it means building [their state’s] own capacity, at the institution and state level, to analyze data useful to the area.”
The State Initiative web portal can be accessed through the CEW website and is available for public access. The portal displays the entire United States divided along state lines. By clicking a state, web users can access all available research reports developed by CEW relevant to each state.
One of CEW’s most recent reports focuses on Pennsylvania’s state university system, which awarded 10 percent more bachelor’s degrees to students from 2009 to 2014. Through the State Initiative, clicking on Pennsylvania allows users to see the full report, a press release, related research and statistically significant figures.
Ridley said he believes the new program is a progressive step to help policymakers utilize existing data to form effective programs and institutional developments. He said the people involved in the project’s actual development and implementation strengthen the CEW’s new initiative.
“I see this as a natural step to be continuing to work with states and helping states move forward. But also CEW has very knowledgeable and very talented researchers, people who are very well-known in their field,” Ridley said. “We were also able to work with experts outside CEW who have a lot of state experience and it was extremely valuable to learn along side them and pick up what they learn from their fields of experience.”
By compiling research into an accessible web portal, Ridley also hopes the initiative will be utilized by those outside of the policymaking field. He argued anyone can explore the data relevant to their state, education level and occupation while being informed of how such information can affect their lives down the road.
“There’s value for students and those who are looking for better data because states and their data systems are able to produce potentially better, higher quality data on what’s happening to students as they go into the labor market now,” Ridley said. “So I think there’s going to be a great benefit to students who are thinking about where to go to college, or thinking about whether to go to college at all, and what course of study and programs people should take.”
While the new initiative marks a significant development for CEW, others believe the program will be effective and useful for those who seek to better inform their own lives.
Anna Teitler (COL ’18), minoring in education, inquiry and justice, said she is pleased that the data is openly available, acknowledging the potential for ordinary citizens to have greater voice when it comes to educational policy.
“It’s an incredible compilation and definitely holds a lot of potential for anyone in charge of making decisions,” Teitler said. “But imagine what ordinary people could do with it, too. Now normal citizens can click on their state and find reports on how well their state is doing. That’s the most interesting part.”
Miller Bartosz (COL ’18) said she thought the State Initiative, while a powerful development in terms of aggregating data, still has room to fill its full potential. He argued the next goal for compiling and organizing data should be focused at a hyper-local level within states.
“It’s relevant and a comprehensive step in terms of talking about ways to make improvements generally,” Bartosz said. “Maybe the program can give states and Georgetown the incentive to conduct and compile research at county levels. That’s where I believe the best research can be done to help states find the best policies.

The World Health Organization convened an International Health Regulations Emergency Committee on the Zika virus Feb. 1, a week after Georgetown University Law Center professors criticized the organization for responding too slowly to the virus’ spread.
Georgetown’s O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law Director Lawrence Gostin and O’Neill Senior Scholar Daniel Lucey published a commentary in the Journal of the American Medical Association Jan. 27 urging the WHO to take action by raising the international alarm on Zika.
“By many accounts the agency’s failure to act decisively cost thousands of lives,” Gostin and Lucey wrote. “Despite internal reforms, however, WHO is still not taking a leadership role in the Zika pandemic.”
Gostin and Lucey laid out specific strategies that the United States needs to take in approaching the Zika crisis, including risk communication, enhanced surveillance, travel advisories, advanced research and development and public health emergency declarations.
“The International Health Regulations requires every country to develop core health system capacities, but most fail to meet international standards,” Gostin and Lucey wrote in the commentary. To ensure national preparedness for Zika, countries—including the United States—should fund and adopt these strategies, particularly countries already affected and those with significant Aedes mosquito populations.”
Though Zika has mostly impacted countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, the WHO named the virus, which is expected to infect up to four million people by the end of the year, a “public health emergency of international concern” at its Feb. 1 committee meeting. The designation is meant to initiate a worldwide response to prevent the spread of the virus and minimize its threat in countries already affected.
Zika is transmitted from infected Aedes mosquitoes to humans through mosquito bites, and may be sexually transmitted, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is typically considered an insignificant disease with only about 20 percent of affected people experiencing symptoms that last from several days to a week. There is no specific antiviral treatment.
Hospitalizations and deaths rarely occur, but pregnancy losses have been reported. Researchers are currently exploring whether these are linked to the virus. Although very rare, a small percentage of people may develop the autoimmune neurological disease Guillain-Barre Syndrome, which causes paralysis and loss of breathing.
The highest risk Zika poses is to pregnant women. The virus is possibly linked to microcephaly, a condition that causes babies to be born with unusually small heads and, in most cases, damaged brains. In Brazil, where the disease is most prevalent, cases of microcephaly are rising rapidly.
Gostin discussed the possible relationship between Zika and microcephaly and emphasized the need to investigate the connection further.
“We strongly suspect that the association will be proven as a causal relationship. But we need definitive studies and we need them urgently,” Gostin wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Lucey said there is potential for a widespread appearance of microcephaly in Latin American countries.
“Importantly, if Zika virus does cause microcephaly then there will be more epidemic waves of microcephaly in other nations such as Columbia, Venezuela, and El Salvador where the Zika virus went after Brazil,” Lucey wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This would be a nightmare so I hope it does not happen.”
Gostin highlighted the possibility that international travel will amplify the spread of the virus, but expressed confidence in the ability of the United States to combat it.
“It is very likely to come to the United States because we have a lot of international travel with Latin America and the Caribbean and the Aedes mosquito is found in the Southern United States and comes up as far north as Washington in the summer,” Gostin wrote. “Having said that, I think Zika will not spin out of control in the U.S. as it has in Brazil. The main reason is that the United States has an aggressive policy of mosquito control and surveillance.”
However, Lucey emphasized the lack of experience the United States has with the virus and stressed the need to implement an improved strategy in response.
“We have minimal to no experience with Zika in the U.S.A.,” Lucey wrote. “No one has any immunity because Zika has never been in the Americas. … We need to take a more integrate 3-part ‘One Health’ approach (Human, animal, and EcoHealth) to understand and control infectious disease epidemics.”
O’Neill Director of Global Health Law Ana Ayala expressed the urgent need for the United States to be aware of Zika cases.
“It is important that the U.S. continue to monitor Zika cases, including locally transmitted ones, as well as keep the public well informed about basic public health measures to avoid mosquito bites should Zika become a greater threat in the country,” Ayala wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Tashi De Sousa (NHS ’17) said that her professors in the Nursing School have been especially concerned about the dangers that Zika poses.
“We talk about it in all my classes,” De Sousa said. “All my professors are healthcare professionals that are worried about not only the health of people in the United States, but also about global health and the disparities that are particularly prevalent in Latin America.”
De Sousa added that concern should be also focused on the athletes and spectators planning on travelling to Brazil for the Olympics this summer.
“It really worries me that the Olympics are going to be held in Brazil because there will be a large population travelling there,” De Sousa said. “It’s scary that this virus can affect not just the direct people infected but also future generations.”

Two Georgetown University professors published a commentary on Jan. 18 criticizing a section of Congress’ recent spending bill that outlines mammography screening recommendations for women.
Under the Affordable Care Act, private insurers are required to follow the recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task Force, which is comprised of independent experts. However, the recent spending bill, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, overrides the ACA by directing insurers to follow outdated recommendations of the Task Force.
The act instructs private insurers to follow the United States Preventive Services Task Force’s 2002 recommendations with respect to breast cancer screening, prevention and mammography, ignoring a 2009 update to the Task Force’s protocol.
The 2002 recommendations instructed women to get mammography screenings every one to two years beginning at age 40. However, they changed their recommendations in 2009, instead stating that women should get screenings every other year beginning at age 50. The Task Force revisited their recommendations again last year and had findings consistent with their 2009 guidelines.
“While screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years may reduce the risk for breast cancer death, the number of deaths averted is smaller than that in older women and the number of false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies is larger,” the Task Force wrote in its Final Recommendation Statement on Breast Cancer Screening published in January.
The Georgetown University Law Center O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law Director Lawrence Gostin and Georgetown University Medical Center Associate Professor Kenneth Lin published a viewpoint in the Journal of the American Medical Association criticizing the legislation.
“Essentially, Congress is requiring health insurers to ignore modern scientific assessments and instead use 14-year-old guidance,” Gostin and Lin wrote in their commentary. “By declining to acknowledge scientific progress, Congress may do more harm than good to women’s health. … When Congress required DHHS [Department of Health and Human Sciences] to link insurance coverage policy to outdated public health guidance, it was making a scientific judgment for which it is distinctly unqualified.”
Gostin and Lin criticized Congress for ignoring the recommendations of the Task Force and coming to its own conclusions on the issue.
“I would say that if you can discount the science in the case of mammograms it can be done with anything, and that would do a disservice to women and all patients,” Gostin wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Lin also emphasized that women may not be aware of the 2009 guidelines and would simply follow the instruction of their insurers, who would follow the 2002 recommendations.
“The problem is … that women are getting shortchanged,” Lin said.
Gostin argued that the actions of Congress are not only undermining women’s health, but the credibility of the Task Force as well.
“The U.S. should have a scientifically neutral body that is fully respected and adhered to. That was supposed to be the Preventive Task Force, but their judgment is too often overridden,” Gostin wrote. “The actions taken by Congress undermine the Task Force’s credibility and integrity.”
Gostin highlighted the importance of applying scientific evidence to public policy decision-making.
“I’m interested in how science is applied to critical public health policy decisions. We should uphold the role of science and evidence in health policy,” Gostin wrote.
The office of Congressman Charles Dent (R-PA), who sponsored the bill, did not respond to The Hoya’s request for comment.
