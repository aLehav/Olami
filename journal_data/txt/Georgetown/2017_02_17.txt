It was a December evening, and over burrito bowls at Chipotle on M Street, Garet Williams (COL ’18) and Habon Ali (SFS ’18) decided to run for Georgetown University School Association president and vice president.
The meeting was far different from when the two first met almost two-and-a-half years earlier at the Preparing to Excel pre-orientation program.
Now, the two are seeking to realize their vision of a more inclusive, supportive and approachable GUSA – a GUSA rooted in their experiences from before and during their time at Georgetown.
Both candidates are part of the Georgetown Scholarship Program. Ali was born and raised in Nairobi, Kenya and moved to the United States with her family when she was 8 years old as a refugee.
Ali emphasized the value her mother placed on education when she was growing up.
“As a woman who was not educated and denied education, not only from a societal point of view but also an economic point of view, she invested in her son and her daughter and she truly pushed me to value education,” Ali said. “As a child I was taught the only way to survive and the only way to be independent in any society is to have an education, and I valued that from a very young age.”
Williams, who was born and raised in Oklahoma, said Georgetown had seemed out of reach both financially and culturally.
“I was always in love with working in the government, but being in the middle of a red state that Donald Trump won every single county of and growing up as a little queer boy in Oklahoma, you are not exactly thinking ‘Oh, this is such a great place for me to study,’” Williams said. “Financially, it just did not seem possible for me to come to a place like Georgetown. My mom and dad told me not to get my hopes up.”
After Ali moved to the United States, financial difficulties posed a barrier to her chances of coming to the Hilltop, too.
“I moved to Minnesota, so I thought I was just going to go to a state school because that’s what my family could afford. I come from a very low-income family. My mom is a factory worker,” Ali said, “The total yearly tuition of this university is what my mom makes in a year.”
Williams and Ali were among each other’s first friends at Georgetown. They first met during PEP, a pre-orientation program for 40 incoming freshmen and transfer students seeking a head start on adjusting to the campus environment.
“I never had to explain to Garet not being able to afford anything on campus, and he understands that,” Ali said. “Coming from that personal background – it’s beautiful not to have to explain yourself constantly.”
Despite their current position as running for the GUSA executive office and positions in GUSA – Williams is a deputy chief of staff and Ali is a GUSA senator – both Ali and Williams initially had negative views about GUSA and its role at Georgetown.
“I joined the second semester of my sophomore year. And so honestly, at the beginning of this, I too, like many people in the Georgetown community, didn’t see the point of GUSA,” Williams said.
For Ali, GUSA was an empty organization designed for and dominated by white males on campus.
“I saw GUSA as, ‘If you’re a white boy, you can be involved in it. If you’re not, don’t even talk about it,’” Ali said.
If identity played a large role in Williams’ and Ali’s first perceptions of GUSA, it played an even larger one in their decision to run for president and vice president.
“I worked so hard to get through that barrier as a woman of color and being a covered Muslim woman, and then when you get through that barrier, you are in that presence of people to fight to be recognized,” Ali said. “I was sick and tired of my voice not being heard.”
Identity has also shaped Williams’ career at Georgetown and in GUSA as he is a member of G.U. Pride.
Ali, who currently serves as vice president of the Muslim Students Association, said that members of the MSA, as well as those of the greater Muslim community at Georgetown, want better representation in GUSA.
MSA President Khadija Mohamud (SFS ’17), who is Ali’s roommate and has known her since freshman year, said GSP has had a significant impact on the dynamic between Ali and Williams.
“GSP is something that draws her and Garet together. They both have the same experience and same pride of being members of the GSP community,” Mohamud said. “Definitely, I think looking at both of them, the reason they have such a great dynamic amongst them is that they both are aware of the intersectionality of their identities and how that allows them to engage and connect with other people.”
Both candidates understand the importance of representation and speaking up for others, according to Mohamud.
“They draw from a common energy to speak up for others,” Mohamud said. “They both have had experiences where someone has threatened to have their voice taken away from them, so they know the value of being able to speak.”

Although they hail from different backgrounds, Kamar Mack (COL ’19) and Jessica Andino (COL ’18) were drawn to Georgetown for similar reasons.
Both came to Georgetown not only for the school’s academics, but also for the opportunities it affords students outside the classroom.
“I am from Memphis, Tenn., and I originally was looking at a lot of schools in the South, but later in senior year, I was encouraged to branch out,” Mack said. “Georgetown also offered me the chance to be around students who were very passionate about things outside of the classroom.”
Likewise, Andino said she found a home for her advocacy efforts on the Hilltop.
“I’d never heard of Georgetown until the summer before my senior year, and I fell in love with the school,” Andino said. “I knew I wanted to study government. I interned for my councilmember back in high school, and I did advocacy for Latino senior citizens.”
The two decided to form a ticket together because of a joint commitment to change the Georgetown University Student Association, according to Maura McDonough (COL ’18), who is serving as Mack and Andino’s campaign manager.
Both candidates are involved in GUSA, where they work to advocate for increased opportunities for marginalized student groups.
Andino joined GUSA last fall to continue advocating for members of the Hispanic and Latinx community as the Undocumented Student Inclusivity policy team chair.
“Connecting students to administrators is what I see as my crucial role there, because that’s when you see more perspectives and administrators can hear more perspectives from students,” Andino said.
Mack said his role as a secretary of local educational affairs for GUSA’s D.C. and Federal Relations Committee has allowed him to engage with the broader D.C. community.
“I’ve been able to advocate for issues that affect Georgetown students, but not on a campus level, on a national and local level,” Mack said.
According to Mack, the campaign is bound together by shared values and a commitment to key issues.
“We individually started thinking about running before we met each other. We both had the goal of making GUSA more diverse, more representative of the entire student body,” Mack said.
Mack, as a member of the historically black fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha D.C. chapter, and Andino, as a member of Georgetown’s Scholarship Program, believe their on-campus experiences would help them diversify GUSA.
“Being in the executive means that not only do you have the obligation of engaging with administrators, but also building community within campus — and also neighbors — so you’re facing a lot groups to meet with and advocate for,” Mack said. “We want to engage with student groups, and there’s definitely a lot of room to do that with my commitments next year, which as of now are the fraternity and living in the Black House.”
While the rest of the GUSA executive candidates are juniors, Andino thinks Mack’s position as the lone sophomore brings a unique perspective to their campaign.
“When we were first talking about our vision, it was very similar,” Andino said. “He’s a sophomore but he’s shown a lot of work and a lot of passion and that’s a very good thing for GUSA, since we are trying to aim for something fresh and new. So that’s a big benefit.”
McDonough said the pair share a passion to get things done.
“How that works together really well as a team is Kamar is the one who can come up with big ideas and say, ‘This is what I want to do, this is the big long term thing,’” McDonough said. “And Jessica is a little more practical in that she has all the knowledge behind it and she’s like ‘OK, let’s flesh it out, let’s do this.’”
Beyond the policy suggestions and their platform, Mack and Andino share a joint vision for the future of GUSA.
“As a pair we really are able to lift each other up,” Mack said. “At the very end of the day, we both just wanted to see a positive change in campus. We both also have the courage to fight for things and speak up if necessary.”

After receiving 100 signatures to join the campaign race three days after last Wednesday’s election season kickoff, Jenny Franke (COL ’18) and Jack McGuire (COL ’18) launched their self-described grassroots campaign earlier this week.
Franke and McGuire are running as Georgetown University Student Association outsiders, motivated by a mission to bring inclusivity, transparency, accountability and change to the student body.
To McGuire, inclusivity encompasses increasing involvement and awareness in student government for those not typically associated with GUSA. McGuire sees his campaign as an example of outsider involvement.
“We want to get more students involved in student government, not everyone who runs needs GUSA experience with an extensive and lengthy platform and large campaign staff,” McGuide wrote.
Franke sees the pair’s inexperience with GUSA as a strength, adding that their experience as students outside of GUSA will offer them insight into the inner workings of the student body.
“We are free from any pre-existing GUSA political ties and have a better feel for what it’s like to be a part of the general student body versus a member of the student government,” Franke wrote. “So, I think this will better allow us to reach the student body and urge them to take a part in student government and campus life.”
Franke agreed that a priority for the campaign is to build a stronger connection between students and student government, ensuring that students are aware of the resources available to them.
“I want to get more of the student body involved in the decision-making process of student government and for more students to be aware of their resources on campus,” Franke wrote.
Discussing his adjustment to campus life after leaving the swim team for a shoulder injury, McGuire said his rejections from student organizations fueled a desire to promote extracurricular and social inclusivity, prompting his eventual run for vice president.
“I applied to various active groups on campus, but none of which resulted in an acceptance. The exclusivity that I have first-hand experienced on campus has really sparked a desire to address the stress culture surrounding clubs that this environment generates,” McGuire wrote.
In contrast, Franke found inspiration to run for office through her roots in extracurricular life at Georgetown. According to Franke, participation in Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Services and Global Brigades was instrumental in building deep bonds that have since turned into the backbone of the Franke-McGuire campaign.
“Extracurricular organizations such as Global Brigades and GERMS have allowed me to make new strong bonds with peers in all grades who I otherwise would not have gotten to know without participating in these organizations. I am so grateful for my support network,” Franke wrote.
According to McGuire, the pair have been friends since freshman year and have had aspirations to run for the presidency and vice presidency since the 2015 GUSA election.
When asked to describe one another, both highlighted the other’s sense of humor.
“Jack is a savage, he speaks his mind and is unabashedly funny,” Franke wrote.
McGuire had one word to summarize his running mate: “Finsta.”
The campaign to date has largely been ran by Director of Logistics Nick Zeffiro (MSB ’18) and other friends of McGuire’S and Franke’s who have volunteered, according to the candidates. The team has yet to release an official platform.
The two candidates have yet to make a public appearance. McGuire did not participate in the GUSA vice presidential debate Feb. 15, and Franke also does not plan to attend Monday night’s presidential debate.
The Franke and McGuire duo was not available for an interview for this article. All comments were written through emails to The Hoya.

Since John Matthews (COL ’18) and Nick Matz (COL ’18) met on the rowing team during their freshman year, the two friends have been involved in a variety of activities on campus.
Matz, who quit rowing last fall, joined the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union, where he serves as vice president of Information Technology. Matthews continues to row and also works at the Residence Hall Office.
Now, Matthews and Matz are looking to add another activity to their resumes: Georgetown University Student Association president and vice president.
In an interview with The Hoya, the pair said their experiences outside of GUSA will help them target students who may feel disconnected from the institution.
“There’s a big disconnect right now between GUSA and the student body,” Matthews said. “We believe we have the ability to represent people who normally don’t participate in GUSA and what GUSA does to the table. We can represent these people.”
The Matthews-Matz ticket is running with a strategically small campaign staff and a targeted, 10-point campaign platform centered on affordability. Their campaign promises to eliminate the three-year housing requirement, the student activity fee and Yates Field House fee in an effort to make students’ experiences at Georgetown more affordable.
“That’s really one issue that affects every student,” Matz said. “That is the unifying thing that is the driving force behind our campaign and hopefully what we will do next year as president and vice president.”
In addition to their unconventionally targeted platform, Matthews and Matz’s campaign consists of a “core” group of campaign staff, including Campaign Manager Ben Stern (MSB ’18) and about 10 students. Beyond this core staff, the pairing also has a group of students campaigning on ITS behalf, according to Matthews.
“Our campaign team right now, we started off with small group formulating the ideas, like the campaign platform, and we branched out so we have representatives on different teams, different prominent organizations throughout Georgetown, different fraternities and sororities who are reaching out and advocating for our platform,” Matthews said.
The two did not launch their campaign at midnight Feb. 9 in Red Square like two other tickets that had entered the race at the time, Garet Williams (COL ’18) and Habon Ali (COL ’18), and Kamar Mack (COL ’19) and Jessica Andino (COL ’18). According to Matz, this is a reflection of their desire to break away from typical GUSA campaigns.
“Anything we would have said or done at midnight in Red Square is not really going to affect our support. I don’t really see how it’s necessary,” Matz said. “It’s just a tradition.”
As a duo, Matthews and Matz have spent plenty of time spent together on the water and as friends. These experiences have prepared them to lead, according to Matthews.
“Being around each other for so long, we know what we’re thinking. We already have a working relationship,” Matthews said. “It’s been tested.”
Each of them brings different strengths to the ticket, according to Matz.
“John’s very outgoing, people like talking to John. I’m more contemplative,” Matz said. “We play off each other well. We complement each other’s strengths.”
Stern, who lives with Mathews and Matz, said the candidates’ involvement in the community reflects their hard work.
“I wake up with them at 5 a.m. every morning to practice six days a week, with afternoon practices on most of those days,” Stern said. “I’ve not met two more hardworking people, just putting in not only practice hours, but they’re always the ones getting extra hours. Nick is on the board of the credit union. They’re really involved and really hard-working.”
Matthews said the skills he has learned from his different involvements at Georgetown have prepared him to be GUSA president.
“You had to be friendly and outgoing and lighthearted, and that’s kind of how I see myself as president. I’m open, people want to talk to me, I understand, I empathize with people, especially of different backgrounds. It would be helpful to have that dialogue with everyone,” Matthews said.
If anything, the two see their inexperience with GUSA as a benefit.
“Coming from the outside, we’d be able to see everything from a different perspective,” Matz said. “It’s somewhat unusual for an outsider to come into this job, but we’ll be able to make a lot of positive changes just from the outside perspective. The only downside I could think of is that we have a lot to learn, but even that, I’m confident in our ability to catch up.”

Lauinger Library’s budget was cut by $1 million for fiscal year 2016, requiring the library to reduce its principal collections of books to avoid staff layoffs.
In July 2015, the library took a 6-percent overall budget reduction as part of a broader university effort to reduce spending, according to University Librarian Artemis Kirk. In order to retain all library staff, the majority of the cuts were made from the library’s collections budget, which were cut by 17.5 percent.
The reduced collection was announced to university faculty in an email sent from library administrators Feb. 9 obtained by The Hoya.
“Cost-cutting has been a university-wide initiative with a goal of providing high-quality education in a sustainable way,” Kirk wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We focused on the collections budget as an area for increased savings. We did not reduce any library- or student-staffing.”
The library budget was cut as part of a university-wide effort of “providing high-quality education in a sustainable way,” according to Vice President of Finance David Rubenstein.
The cut is part of a larger series of cuts to the university budget, according to the email sent to faculty. K. Matthew Dames, associate university librarian for scholarly resources, said the $1 million reduction is unlikely to be reversed in future years.
“For the past several years, the Library’s budget consistently has been approximately of $17 to $17.5 million. With last fiscal year’s cut, it now is about $16 to $16.5 million,” Dames wrote in an email to The Hoya.
According to Dames, Lauinger will continue to invest in electronic databases, e-journals, e-books and research materials in an effort to remain committed to providing the Georgetown academic community with the resources necessary for learning, teaching and research.
“We have no way of knowing how much material we will be able to restore after we made the necessary cuts from collections to meet the $1 million reduction. The library has not recouped any of the $1 million it lost last fiscal year, and we are expecting that sum will not be restored for the foreseeable future,” Dames wrote.
Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh said the collections reductions were made carefully.
“The library managed the collections reduction very careful by reviewing usage, costs, availability through our consortia and in consultation with stakeholders on campus and off. Many other major research libraries had already reduced their budgets in an effort to contain the rising costs of research materials and to be able to acquire new tools within existing budgets,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Efficient budget management has allowed the library to continue operating with excellent support of faculty, students and staff.”
Faculty can appeal cuts made to the library’s resources in an effort to have them restored, according to the email sent to faculty.
According to Kirk, the cuts mirror a larger trend of cuts to research library spending in college campuses across the U.S. Yale University and Cornell University among others have made cuts to their library collection budgets.
“Many other major research libraries in the U.S. had already had budget cuts for a number of years. Georgetown’s reduction came later than other libraries’,” Kirk wrote.
Sophie Cutler (MSB ’20), who works at the library, said she feels the budgetary cuts place constraints placed on special collections.
“We just have books lying around that have no place,” Cutler said. “It’s still evident on the first floor, where you can go and you could be looking to put a book back and it physically cannot go on the shelf where it’s supposed to go.”
Kirk wrote that the library continues to be committed to excellence regardless of the cuts.
“As with other research libraries, we will continue to review our allocations to assure best use of funds,” Kirk said. “We must manage the rising costs of research materials and still acquire new resources as they are developed.”

Just another step in the corporatization of Georgetown. It not about scholarship any more, its about the “brand” and the profit, aka. the endowment fund and senior administrations obscene salaries. How about a budget cut for DeGoia?

To assist those displaced by the Syria’s civil war, the United States must help establish and maintain safe zones in Syria where civilians will not be in danger, according to a bipartisan panel of journalists, advocates, political commentators and politicians in a panel hosted by Georgetown’s Institute of Politics and Public Service.
The panel focused its discussion on efforts to stop the growing death toll of the Syrian conflict at the event, entitled “Syrian Conflict: Is there a Bipartisan Solution?” in the Intercultural Center Auditorium on Jan. 13.
CNN Contributor Sarah Elizabeth “S.E.” Cupp, who is also a board member for Help Me Go Home and an advisory board member for GU Politics, said the history of the Syrian conflict is essential to understanding the current policy quandaries facing the United States.
In 2011, a protest of the Assad regime in the Syrian city of Daraa turned violent when the Syrian military began an 11-day siege on the city. The military reaction prompted an escalation of the Arab Spring conflicts, which would eventually turn into a Syrian civil war.
The Syrian regime continued the aggressive persecution of its people through the use of chemical weapons, which led to the Obama administration to draw a red line, meaning threatening military action if chemical weapons were used by the Assad regime.
Cupp said that 500,000 Syrians died, 50,000 of which were children, and 8.5 million Syrians are currently in need of immediate aid.
“Syria is a very complicated story to tell, which is probably in part why it doesn’t get told very often,” Cupp said. “Especially as millennials, you are unique and in a uniquely disturbing position of being the first generation to watch a holocaust, a genocide, in real time on your devices, on your television, on your social media. So there’s no excuse for not knowing what’s going on.”
According to Syrian native Nora Barré, who is a board member for Help Me Go Home, a humanitarian advocacy group, the problem originated with the Assad regime and the support it has received from the Iranian and Russian governments. Barré said the first step in assisting Syrians in regaining their lives is the establishment of safe zones in Syria that would be defended by the U.S. military.
“I would love to see a safe zone, a safe zone where people can go home. Right now, if there was a safe zone established in Syria these people would go home. They would go back,” Barré said. “They still have hope despite all of the violence that’s occurred there in the last five years.”
Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), a member of the House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs, said the Obama administration did not establish safe zones because the commitment would have eventually led to larger military involvement in the region and because the zones could not be fully secured.
“The president did not think that the public would support another U.S. involvement and another war in addition to Iraq and Afghanistan,” Richard said. “But there was a great concern that we set up an area, call it safe and then not have it be safe. Making it safe is the part that’s so hard.”
Anne Richard, the former assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration under former President Barack Obama, also said setting up safe zones could lead to the forcing of refugees who have resettled in other countries to return home.
“One of the key humanitarian principles that we adhere to is that people not be forced back, that they be allowed to go home when they choose to go home voluntarily and when it’s safe to do so,” Richard said.
Kinzinger addressed Richard, saying the reservations of the Obama administration were not well-founded, since the public could have been persuaded of the necessity of intervention.
“You’re correct in saying that the American people weren’t ready for a third intervention in the Middle East, but that’s because it wasn’t sold to them,” Kinzinger said. “We are willing to do very tough things, we are willing to do very difficult things, but we have to have it explained to us why that’s important.”
Cupp defended Richard’s assessment, saying during the Obama administration safe zones were not viable seeing as the United States. did not have the domestic or foreign support necessary.
Cupp added that she is hopeful that President Donald Trump can use his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin to cooperate in establishing safe zones. Russia intervened on behalf of the Syrian government to carry out attacks against the rebel groups in Syria.
“It’s not a controversial idea within politics, but the American people were not there and President Obama did not have a particularly good relationship with Russia,” Cupp said. “Trump, for all of his flaws, I am hoping can turn this coziness with Vladimir Putin, which scares me on a number of levels, into an asset.”
Barré said that opportunities for negotiation may be slim and even if safe zones are established, the cooperation between Russia, Syria and the United States would not be stable.
“But I would not trust Assad. Mr. Trump would have to understand that the safe zone would have to have consequences if violated,” Barré said.
Kinzinger advocated for retaliatory strikes against Syria if it breaks the agreement of safe zones and for a greater military presence on the part of the United States in the region.
“What we have to do as Americans, and maybe you’ll call this arrogant, is remember and realize that we are the most powerful country in the world,” Kinzinger said. “On the battlefield we will not be defeated, the only thing that will be defeated is our will.”
CNN Chief National Security Correspondent Jim Sciutto moderated the panel.
In his introduction of the panel, Mo Elleithee, executive director for GU Politics, highlighted the changing purpose of the institute due to the end of the 2016 campaign and election season.
“So much of the existence of the institute, even the timing of our founding, has focused on the presidential campaign. But the campaign’s over, and now we turn to the business of governing,” Elleithee said. “That doesn’t mean politics goes away.”

The civil war in Syria and President Bashar al-Assad’s attempts to quell rebels have led to an increase in extremism in the region, according to a talk by Alexander Marquardt (SFS ’04), ABC News foreign correspondent, Monday evening.
Marquardt has covered significant world events, including the 2008 United States presidential election campaign, and has reported from North Africa and the Middle East since the Arab Spring in 2011.
He has also covered the Syrian Civil War, reporting on both the government and rebel factions, which have been at war since March 2011 for control of the country. Marquardt said the conflict was by far the most difficult and complicated war he could have covered.
“I want to focus on Syria, which is closest to my heart, is a story that I’ve probably spent the most time on since the last 6 years of the Arab spring and frankly is the only place in the Middle East these days where you are seeing an ongoing element of the Arab Spring,” Marquardt said. “Although, for all intents and purposes, the war in Syria is over.”
Assad’s efforts to quell the revolution had a catalytic effect on extremism in Syria and the Middle East, according to Marquardt.
“[Assad] started to propagate that protesters were terrorists and that’s why he needed to crack down,” Marquardt said. “The Assad regime fomented the unrest by cracking down, by fueling the rise of extremism, by fueling secularism, by bringing in people like Iran and Hezbollah from neighboring Lebanon. At the same time on the other side, you had Saudi, the other Gulf countries, Turkey and the U.S fueling the rebels.”
Marquardt saw the rise of extremist Islamism unfold before him while reporting in rebel-held areas. He said Turkey played a key role on the ground supporting rebel factions.
“They would be down there with briefcases full of cash facilitating the buying of weapons and the transfer of soldiers, of fighters – this was a time when Turkey wanted to defeat Assad so they just let anybody across the border willy-nilly,” Marquardt said.
According to Marquardt, the border regions were a hotbed for the rise of extremism.
“We started to see the rise of this extremism, you know, spending time on the border. I would fly down and it would be a bunch of Turks and my team and all these guys who probably shouldn’t have been flying down to the border with bright green Saudi passports and thin wispy beards and sandals – all the tell-tale signs of a jihadist,” Marquardt said.
Sitting in on ABC’s interview with Assad, the first broadcast interview with Assad, Marquardt said that having to hold back a smile was his strongest memory.
“I knew down the line it would come back to haunt me,” Marquardt said.
Additionally, Marquardt has made extensive use of social media in his reporting, using Snapchat to report from Mosul, where Iraqi forces were attempting to reclaim territory from the Islamic State in 2016.
Following the event, Marquardt said in an interview with The Hoya that he uses social media to connect with larger audiences, including those in Syria.
“I put an extra effort into things like social media so that people all around the world start to follow my work, but also when I’m dealing with officials in Aleppo they know who I am, not because they’ve seen me on World News Tonight, but because they’ve followed my Twitter feed,” Marquardt said.
Journalism has an ever more powerful role to play in the world, according to Marquardt.
“You are seeing the best and the worst of humanity, and I think that at the end of the day there is an argument to be made that ignorance is bliss, but I’m just really happy that even if most of the stuff I’m seeing is awful, that I get to see it,” Marquardt said.

Employees in Washington, D.C. will receive paid family leave benefits starting in January 2020 after Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) allowed the legislation funding the new program to move to the U.S. Congress for review.
Bowser, who is a vocal critic of the act’s financial cost and extent of the law’s coverage, declined to veto the legislation late Wednesday evening, allowing the bill to go to Congress without her signature.
Unless the Republican-controlled Congress moves to block the Universal Paid Leave Act of 2015, the bill will become law. The D.C. Council passed the legislation with a veto-proof nine to four vote Dec. 20, 2016.
The plan ensures paid leave for eight weeks to parents of newborns, six weeks to workers tending to an ill relative and two paid weeks for sick leave.
The paid leave plan, one of the most generous of the country, will be funded through a payroll tax that will go into effect January 2019 and will require the formation of a new city agency to oversee the implementation of benefits.
The benefits established by the bill do not extend to federal and District government employees as the city cannot tax federal workers and city employees already benefit from a paid leave program.
According to a statement from Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large), one of the original cosponsors of the bill, the plan is a progressive victory for the District.
“We are now one step closer to relieving D.C. families and workers from the difficult choice between a paycheck and caring for a loved one,” Grosso said in a press release. “Paid leave provides financial stability to workers while allowing them to care for ailing family members. Parents who take leave after the arrival of a new child will return to work in better general health. More women will participate in the work place. Infant mortality will decline.”
Despite the House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee issuing a formal markup of disapproval of D.C.’s Death with Dignity Act on Monday evening, the fourth time Congress has voted down a D.C. law since the passing of the 1973 Home Rule Act, Grosso’s office does not expect congressional intervention. However, neither the full House nor the U.S. Senate voted down the Death With Dignity Act within the 30-day review period.
Grosso’s Communications Director Matthew Nocella said Grosso hopes Congress will not interfere in this local legislation.
“Congress can pass a disapproval resolution which would invalidate it,” Nocella wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Congress has failed to do that as recently as this week with the Death with Dignity Act. The councilmember can’t predict Congress, but he doesn’t believe that this is an issue that they are paying particular attention to.”
Bowser broke with her party to oppose the bill throughout almost two years of negotiations with the city council.
In a letter Bowser sent to Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) on Wednesday, Bowser emphasized that though she agrees with the principle of providing aid to families, she disagrees with the structure of the current plan because it provides greater aid to non-District residents who work in the city.
“[The act] attempts to advance a D.C. Value that we share: that D.C. families should have time to care for themselves and their loved ones,” Bowser wrote in the letter. “As you know, my Administration has been steadfast in our desire and tireless in our work to give all residents a fair shot to achieve and maintain economic security in a thriving D.C.”
The plan will impose a new 0.62 percent payroll tax on all District employers. The tax is expected to create $250 million annually, which will be allocated by the mayor’s office.
Bowser cited this tax increase as a detriment to local businesses. She added that it will impose a significant burden on the city government to create infrastructure to implement the plan, before the tax revenue is collected.
According to Bowser, two-thirds of the recipients of benefits will not be D.C. residents.
Bowser indicated she will continue to work with the council to address these and other concerns, like the creation of new technology infrastructure to collect the tax.

Thousands of immigrants and immigration advocates across the United States participated in a national strike Thursday to protest President Donald Trump’s immigration policies.
The protests, collectively called the “Day without Immigrants,” originally gained traction on social media, informally organized on Facebook and WhatsApp, an instant messaging service.
Organizers said the protests attempted to show the effects of immigrant communities on U.S. companies and local businesses.
In Washington, D.C., the protests had the most significant influence on the restaurant industry, with dozens of restaurants closing their doors for the day.
The Architect of the Capitol, which manages the food and support staff for the Capitol building congressional offices, announced that it would function on a modified schedule to accommodate staff participating in the protests.
According to The Washington Post, nearly 48 percent of restaurant workers are foreign-born in the District area.
Sweetgreen, a salad restaurant chain, closed all 20 of its locations in D.C. The restaurant Busboys and Poets also closed its locations in solidarity with the movement.
Celebrity chef José Andrés closed a few of his District area restaurants in support of the immigrant community. Andrés is currently involved in litigation against Trump after going back on an agreement to open a restaurant in the recently opened Trump International Hotel in D.C. because of Trump’s comments about Mexican immigrants on the campaign trail.
Katie Hurd, a spokesperson for Andrés’ ThinkFoodGroup, said the company closed restaurants to support workers who wanted to participate in protests. Oyamel, Zaytinya and the three locations of Jaleo all closed for the day. Hurd said a number of restaurants remained open during the day.
“In solidarity with the many immigrants on our staff who are passionate about participating in A Day Without Immigrants, ThinkFoodGroup will close most of its DC-area restaurants on Thursday, February 16,” Hurd wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“China Chilcano, minibar/barmini and all locations of Beefsteak will remain open, staffed by a collective team from all of our D.C.-area restaurants so that we can continue to both serve our guests as well as provide for those of our staff who plan to work that day,” Hurd wrote.
The protests also affected District schools. The Latin American Montessori Bilingual Public Charter School closed on Thursday due to protests.
District Public Schools Chief of Schools John Davis emailed DCPS administrators earlier this week in anticipation of the protests, saying that although students and staff have the right to protest, they were still required to come to schools Thursday.
“DCPS schools are and will continue to be safe places for all students and all people in our communities, regardless of immigration status, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression,” Davis wrote. “We highly value and are committed to fostering a learning environment where staff and students feel safe and secure and we respect the right to self-expression and peaceful protest.”
Iranian immigrant Ahmad Erfani also told WAMU, American University’s radio station, he was closing his bakery, La Caprice, for the demonstrations.
“They are hard workers,” Erfani said. “I am not happy when I see they are not very happy these days, because it is difficult. They work hard, they come here [at] six in the morning.”
Clarissa Martínez-de-Castro, the deputy vice president at the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy organization, told The Washington Post the demonstrations presented an inspiring image for immigrant communities.
“In a time when the administration doesn’t seem to see anything positive about the immigrant community, having small-business owners, chefs and their workers challenge that notion and give voice to the very real ways immigrants contribute to society is very significant,” Martinez said.

A professor who combines history and science in one course, a professor who helps students of color adapt to life at Georgetown and another who serves as a faculty adviser to the Georgetown University Student Veteran Association received this year’s Dean’s Award for Excellence in Teaching in the Gonda Theater on Jan. 30.
History professor Kathryn Olesko, sociology professor Leslie Hinkson and Spanish and Portuguese professor Barbara Mujica received the award, which recognizes the efforts of teachers who succeed in enhancing students’ lives both in and out of the classroom.
Faculty members nominated for the award are typically involved with contemporary research, have innovative teaching styles and are available as a resource to students outside the classroom, according to Georgetown College Dean Chester Gillis.
“Professors who can motivate students and excite students about a discipline and engage students in their research and can do it at a very high level and very consistently should be recognized,” Gillis said.
Olesko is known for her unique interdisciplinary courses that fuse history and science. Because her courses attract a diverse group of students, Olesko said her main focus in the classroom is intellectual diversity.
“Different majors in a course latch on to material in different ways. I find that difference has to be recognized from the start to ensure that the course both accommodates diverse intellectual interests and provides an opportunity for all students to appreciate different expressions of intellectual diversity sufficiently well to grow and develop together,” Olesko said.
According to Olesko, she aims to teach students through building on their existing knowledge, and hopes to give students learning experiences that are tailored to their learning styles and academic interests.
As a faculty member of color, Hinkson said she brings a perspective to teaching that is different from that of many of her peers. Hinkson makes herself available as a resource to all students, but said she is often sought out by students of color.
“Being someone who comes from a low-income background, there are things that I understand about the experiences in particular of low-income students of color and first-generation students that a lot of faculty members don’t get,” Hinkson said.
Courtney Maduike (SFS ’17) said Hinkson has had a significant impact on not just her academic experience, but also on her entire Georgetown experience.
“Professor Hinkson helped me navigate the struggles and stresses of being a student of color coming into her racial identity at a predominantly white institution,” Maduike wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Mujica, the faculty advisor for GUSVA, has done significant service in the Georgetown and Washington, D.C. communities. She has done extensive work with the university to incorporate programs for veterans at Georgetown, most notably with academic assistance.
“You come, you serve. It’s not just teaching,” Mujica said. “We have an atmosphere here where if somebody sees something that needs to be done, that person can do it.”
Mujica also takes students’ learning outside of the classroom to further enrich their academic experience, according to Tim Annick (COL ’16).
“Her teaching extends beyond the classroom, with field trips to plays, flamenco shows, and film screenings, which do more than broaden her students’ intellectual horizons. She encourages and facilitates connections between her students by allowing us to share who we are outside of the classroom with those inside it,” Annick wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Hinkson said the relationships built in the classroom are just as important as the information being taught.
“If I’m in a classroom and I’m not connecting with students, then I gotta up my game,” Hinkson said.

The commitment to a fresh, more diverse and representative Georgetown University Student Association is reflected in Kamar Mack (COL ’19) and Jessica Andino’s (COL ’18) platform.
“We have built every single piece of our platform to serve underrepresented populations. That is something that Jessica and I hold dear,” Mack said. “We believe that GUSA traditionally hasn’t shown a full grasp of what it means to be diverse. GUSA should start drawing from different communities, not just different identities.”
On the platform, the Mack-Andino campaign emphasizes three components: entrepreneurship, affordability and student health.
Entrepreneurship
Whereas GUSA candidates generally include entrepreneurship on their platforms, few have placed a stronger emphasis on the topic than Mack has.
“Our planks, we wanted them to be overarching and encompassing a lot of things that wouldn’t necessarily come to mind when you hear the word,” Mack said. “So when you hear of entrepreneurship you think ‘Oh, someone on ‘Shark Tank’ about to start a business.’ But we think of it as something that involves a lot more. What makes it so important is how related it is to students who don’t consider themselves entrepreneurs.”
The ticket has five policy proposals dedicated to spurring entrepreneurship on campus, including establishing a Startup Market similar to the Farmer’s Market for entrepreneurs and centralizing information about available funding for startups.
According to Mack, the university could reap significant financial rewards if it increased its investment in startups.
“We want to see a Georgetown where you get to campus and entrepreneurship is encouraged, not just something that is a feature of the school that we have to offer,” Mack said. “It’s also going to be very good for Georgetown long-term. If we get 10 to 15 successful startups coming out of Georgetown every year, that’s going to do a lot for our endowment and that’s going to make Georgetown a lot more affordable.”
Mack and Andino’s campaign manager Maura McDonough (COL ’18) said the focus on entrepreneurship does not devalue other aspects of the campaign but is worth highlighting because GUSA has not emphasized it in the past.
“We are not prioritizing entrepreneurship in the sense that it is more important than anything else, but it is something that has never been a priority in GUSA like it should have been. So that’s why it’s one of the main pillars,” McDonough said. “It’s an issue that needs to be brought forward. We’re not saying it’s more important, we’re saying it’s not visible.”
Affordability
According to Mack, the high cost of tuition and its effects on the student population should be a concern addressed by GUSA.
“If you look at rising costs of attendance, it’s one of those multifaceted, big, difficult issues to tackle, where you can’t wave your magic wand and make tuition go down,” Mack said. “But there is a lot of opportunity to push back against it and to limit the amount that tuition is going up from a policy standpoint.”
Mack sees more efficient resource allocation especially in terms of utilities as the key to making Georgetown more affordable.
“We want to advocate on behalf of the student body to make the university, on a yearly basis, look at every single line item on the budgets of each department and determine at what is the most efficient way to allocate those resources,” Mack said. There’s also a lot we can do with saving money in utilities because that is an area where students have a direct impact and that can positively affect university expenses.”
Mack said evaluating the amount of money that goes into utilities can directly affect access and affordability at Georgetown. Georgetown has spent more than $27 million on utilities in fiscal year 2016, according to the university’s financial statements.
The pair also wants to ensure that the costs of books and laundry, among other day to day expenses, are included in the calculations for financial aid, and that the university increases transparency around tuition increases.
If elected as president, Mack also hopes to work with the university and Aramark to increase off-hours dining options, especially for low-income students. The university renewed its contract with Aramark for 10 years in November, with plans to expand meal exchange options and convert the first floor of O’Donovan Hall into a food court this summer.
The Mack and Andino campaign see dining as an area that can be more affordable. For instance, the two plan to introduce a food pantry for students from low-income backgrounds, among other solutions.
“With the Aramark contract being signed, there are four main things that we need to focus on. The first is to push for more for a meal swipe, because that’s something you can do within the constraints of the contract,” Mack said. “Second is, ensuring that the upcoming changes that are happening in Hoya Court allow you to use meal swipes. For example, if we get Chick-Fil-A, Jessica and I are committed to pushing very hard for meal swipes at Chick-Fil-A because if we have it and you can only use flex, we’d all be sad.”
The new contract calls for expanded dining options, which Mack believes will improve the variety of food available. Mack said the ticket wants to ensure dining options for all students, including more halal and kosher options, are available.
Beyond campus dining, Mack hopes to make groceries and other necessities more accessible and affordable for Georgetown students, in particular those living in apartments or off-campus housing.
Student Health
The team’s campaign platform includes a number of policies for access to health resources, and mental health and sexual reform.
The Mack and Andino campaign wants to build upon the foundation laid by last year’s survey and memorandum of understanding on sexual assault. The campaign has proposed transparency reports each semester from the Title IX office, containing information on the number of cases initiated and the number of students found guilty of committing sexual misconduct.
The campaign also wants to facilitate easier forms of medical leaves of absence for survivors of sexual assault.
According to Mack, current sexual assault policies should also be revisited to ensure that the Title IX office is as effective as possible.
“One policy we want to work with the administration on is the fact that if a first-semester senior sexually assaults someone on campus, they could take a leave of absence, nothing would happen, they would graduate and then finish the rest of their classes. If someone is not enrolled in the university, you can’t initiate a Title IX process, especially if they have enough credits,” Mack said. “It’s one of those areas where we don’t have definite policy but needs to be addressed.”
The pair’s mental health platform, which includes a provision advocating for the ability of students to drop courses without penalty during their first semester at Georgetown, could provide meaningful change for students, according to Project Lighthouse Founder and President Ben Johnson (NHS ’17).
“I have to give it to Kamar and Jessica as far as having an option that’s effective, but will actually play out within their one year term, they can actually add significant sort of programs and add significant support for this sort of programs,” Johnson said.
McDonough said the campaign wants to take a more holistic approach to student health.
“We are looking at health as not just when you need to go to the health center but student health the way we are approaching it is encompassing everything you need to be a productive, healthy student,” McDonough said. “Mental health, sexual assault reform, accessibility, things like that.”

Of the candidates in this year’s Georgetown University Student Association election, John Matthews (COL ’18) and Nick Matz (COL ’18) have presented students with the shortest platform, which includes a total of 10 policy points.
The platform consists of policies designed to reduce the cost of attending Georgetown, including eliminating the student activities fee, eliminating the Student Neighborhood Assistant Program and introducing oversight of textbook costs.
In addition, the platform pledges to eliminate the three-year housing requirement and cancel random drug-testing for student athletes by the university.
Matthews said reducing the cost of attendance is an issue that affects all students.
“It’s universal, it affects everybody by mitigating costs students have to pay,” Matthews said.
The limited size of the platform does not reflect a lack of commitment to other issues that may affect students, according to Matz.
“The reasons our platform is so narrow is, that’s the goal, as executives,” Matz said. “That’s something that we will make our mission. There are tons of issues on campus. Just because that’s not our primary focus doesn’t mean we won’t do a good job.”
The pair also said they hope their platform appeals to students who may not historically vote in GUSA elections.
“There’s a big disconnect right now between GUSA and the student body,” Matthews said. “We believe we have the ability to represent people who normally don’t participate in GUSA and what GUSA does to the table. We can represent these people.”
Decreasing the size of GUSA plays a significant role in the pair’s platform, as a continuation of their efforts to decrease costs.
The ticket’s proposed budget for GUSA would see about a 28 percent decrease in GUSA’s operating budget, from $21,800 to $15,667.54.
However, the budget does see a 233 percent increase, from $150 to $500, for the Student Advocacy Office alongside smaller increases for online peer-support group Project Lighthouse and Multicultural Week. The GUSA Election Commission sees the greatest reduction in funding, from $400 to $19.72.
“This goes back to the goal of our platform, but throwing more money at a problem will not fix it,” Matthews said. “Our leadership style is one we’re going to expect a lot from people in GUSA to follow through on tasks. If you’re in GUSA, you’re there to serve the community.”
The two are proposing the elimination of the $79.50 student activity fee. According to Matz, moving to more individualized funding for each club would be a more effective solution to club funding.
“There are some clubs that would really benefit from just the participation fee rather than just an overarching $80 fee for all students. That way funds are going directly to what students are involved in without the middle-man,” Matz said. “That way clubs that have a lot of members can have more funds.”
The two are open to compromise on the proposal, however.
“We are still up for compromise because there are certainly clubs that need more funding and don’t have a certain number of funding, so we are open to compromise. But that is the direction we are heading,” Matthews said. “More individualized, focused club funding.”
The pair’s planned elimination of the student activity fee could change the role of the senate, whose current primary focus is appropriating the student activities budget.
“You get to hear a lot of upperclassman and lowerclassman thoughts and it’s definitely valuable to have that discussion and dialogue we think in the senate,” Matthews said. “There definitely will be some role for the senate, just what it is we will find out.”
The inclusion of these largely austerity-focused policies comes at the expense of issues central to most past and current GUSA candidates. Noticeably, the duo’s platform does not include topics such as mental health, sexual assault policy and diversity and inclusivity.
However, the pair said it will commit to addressing issues students care about.
“GUSA represents student interests, and if student interests are sexual assault and mental health, that’s what we have to do,” Matthews said. “The spirit of Georgetown, of course we have to address those issues.”
In the vice presidential debate Wednesday evening, Matz said the pair would look to cost-effectively increase Counseling and Psychiatric Services resources for students.
“Just looking at the current staff that is there, there’s a dozen clinical psychologists and psychiatrists and there’s only one licensed clinical social worker and one licensed independent clinical social worker,” Matz said. “What that means is that those two social workers provide a very comparable level of treatment to the psychologists and psychiatrists at a fraction of the cost.”
This policy could be challenging to execute, according to Project Lighthouse President and Co-Founder Benjamin Johnson (NHS ’17), as CAPS has no more room in its offices available for staff.
Johnson said while the lack of specific mental health policy is disappointing, the team’s inclusion of increased funding for Project Lighthouse is promising.
“I like the fact that the other campaigns have mental health problems, but in my mind I don’t know that the Matthew/Matz campaign is not necessarily thinking about mental health since they have included it as a line in their budget.”
The pair’s proposals to eliminate the three-year housing plan and require residents to pay for SNAPs could face the most challenges if the pair were elected to office.
The university and neighborhood signed a legally binding 20-year Campus Plan in September, which contains the university’s three-year housing requirement. According to former Area Neighborhood Commissioner Reed Howard (COL ’17), who participated in negotiations for the campus plan, this makes eliminating the three-year housing requirement impossible.
“It is locked into a 20-year legally binding agreement, and this is one of the neighbors’ favorite parts of the agreement. There is no way this would ever be renegotiated in the next GUSA administration, or ever within the next 20 years,” Howard said.
Howard said using SNAPs, despite being cost effective for the university to offer at a lower cost than being required to pay Washington, D.C. property taxes to use District services, is advantageous for students.
“I would rather the neighbors call SNAP then have them call MPD, it is much better to deal with the school disciplinary system than get a 61D citation,” Howard said.
According to Matz, students should not have to bear the costs of this service.
“They do great work and they have an important role but the costs should not be reflected on Georgetown students if their main benefactor is the neighborhood,” Matz said.

The policy platform proposed by Georgetown University Student Association executive candidates Garet Williams (COL ’18) and Habon Ali (SFS ’18) focuses on efforts to expand diversity, transparency and mental health.
According to Williams, his and Ali’s campaign focuses on four themes crucial to any Georgetown student’s experience: “Resources, transparency, inclusivity and you.”
Resources
Williams stressed the importance of accessibility of resources to all Georgetown students. Williams said he wants to enable and encourage students to take initiative and find ways to create their own change through the framework of GUSA.
The pair has policy designed to increase available resources for students in 15 areas, from academic affairs to unrecognized student groups.
Williams/Ali advocate the continuation of the Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey every two years, alongside advocating ensuring the recommendations of the Sexual Assault and Misconduct Task Force are acted upon.
H*yas for Choice recently gave three out of the four GUSA tickets grades based on how each candidate’s platform complements HFC’s policy goals. Williams and Ali scored the highest out of the three tickets rated, with an A- grade.
Williams and Ali scored best in the student health center services and Affordable Care Act changes section of the questionnaire. HFC’s executive board wrote that Williams and Ali’s focus on sexually transmitted infections and advocacy for students to maintain access to contraception in light of the Affordable Care Act repeal are what separated them from other candidates.
“We were particularly enthused by their demonstrated understanding of issues at the Student Health Center and support of university funding for free and anonymous STI screening,” the HFC executive board wrote on their blog. “Additionally, their research on the implications of ACA repeal and commitment to pressuring Georgetown University to maintaining current health care standards was evident in their platform and in their response to our questions.”
Another health-related focus of the Williams-Ali campaign is the cultural and ethnic disparity in treatment from the Counseling and Psychiatric Services at Georgetown. The campaign is looking to introduce institutionalized cultural competency training for health staff.
“One issue that — coming from a different background —is that CAPS has not had the capacity to be able to be there for students of different minority groups. I’ve had multiple conversations with the Asian community and the Muslim community and the Latinx community about when it comes to mental health,” Ali said.
Ali said in the vice presidential debate Wednesday evening that the ticket’s mental health strategy centers around prevention. The ticket also plans to advocate to decrease appointment wait times at CAPS and the Student Health Center.
Project Lighthouse President Ben Johnson (NHS ’17) expressed concern over the clarity of Williams and Ali’s mental health policy.
“One thing they said was that they wanted to advocate for increased responsiveness at CAPS, and we really don’t have any idea of what that means or what it looks like,” Johnson said. “I’m sure there is an anecdotal story somewhere, someone calling CAPS and not having the phone picked up or something like that, but do you send them a strong word down the ladder about like ‘are you diverting GUSA funds to hire more receptionists’, like I really don’t understand what that means.”
At the most basic level, the pair hopes to improve infrastructure available for students at Georgetown. Williams and Ali plan to advocate for better technological infrastructure – the campus WiFi infrastructure, the Georgetown smartphone application and the Livesafe application all need revision according to the pair.
Williams and Ali are also interested in affording students the opportunities to take internships for course credits. Students of the McDonough School of Business are already able to take internships for credit, but Williams and Ali want to extend this eligibility to students in the three other undergraduate schools.
Transparency
Transparency is essential to ensuring GUSA can effectively serve the student body, according to Ali.
“We focused on it specifically because the more we engage with the student body, we realize, the less the student body knows about us,” Ali said of transparency. “And that’s a problem, right?  If this is a student association that not only respects and is supposed to be there for the student body, we need to allow that transparency to exist, not just in terms of GUSA, but across campus.”
In keeping with the objective of transparency, Williams wants to continue the town hall structure currently in place and advocate for full tuition transparency, especially in consideration of Georgetown’s annual tuition increases.
Both Williams and Ali praised the internal diversity survey recently performed by Students of Georgetown, Inc. They expressed hope that other clubs, like Blue & Gray and Lecture Fund, perform similar surveys and publish the results for maximum transparency.
“GUSA should be doing the same thing.  And we should be publishing these reports regularly, so that the student body can say, ‘You know what, let’s hold you accountable to this.  You said you were going to make yourself more diverse,” Williams said.
Inclusivity
Williams said the pair plans to increase inclusivity on campus by advocating for students of all identities.
“With these types of issues, there are a number of people who advocate on campus, making sure that we, as GUSA, can support that, instead of working in redundancy to that,” Williams said.
Williams also stressed the campaign goal of making Georgetown a more accessible place for students with disabilities, including advocating for improved sensitivity training for professors and affirming support for the Disability Studies Minor.
About 320 members of the Georgetown community had signed a petition calling for the university to launch a disabilities studies minor as of Oct. 27.
The campaign is also looking to increase racial and cultural inclusivity, alongside support for students without documentation. The pair wants to explore the viability of courses in Latinx studies, Native American studies and South Asian Studies, and push for the creation of a design space for students without documentation on campus.
The pair also wants to hire a full-time advisor for students without documentation. The university hired a part-time advisor for students without documentation in November, after student advocacy group UndocuHoyas launched a petition calling for administrators to hire a full-time coordinator for students without documentation.
Ali explained the importance of their campaign’s slogan in the way they would govern should they win GUSA.
“GUSA needs to stop being about itself, and it needs to actually focus on the people,” Ali said. “Now, what we’re doing is that, by saying “it’s time for you”—it’s time for each individual student on campus and changing it from the structure of governance to a student association.”

After three decades of discussion and environmental concerns, the United States National Park Service approved a Potomac River recreation zone in Georgetown to support non-motorized boat activity Feb. 13.
The zone will stretch from 34th St. NW, which falls within the Georgetown Waterfront Park, to a quarter-mile upriver from Key Bridge.
The NPS first developed the plan for the Georgetown Waterfront Park in 1987 to create a recreational area for Georgetown residents.
Although NPS National Capital Regional Director Bob Vogel signed a Finding of No Significant Impact, environmental groups have expressed concern about the negative effects of increased human activity in the area on wildlife.
District of Columbia Environmental Network Executive Director Chris Weiss said he was concerned about the project’s environmental impact on the canal’s ecology.
“If there’s more people directed to that zone, there are going to be more environmental impacts to trees and wildlife,” Weiss said. “Not that long ago, three or four years ago, I used to walk down the canal and I could count hundreds of turtles. Now there are so many people in boats going up and down the canal, I don’t see turtles anymore.”
NPS Public Affairs Officer Jeremy Barnum said he hopes the boat zone will show how the NPS can preserve land across the country, even in urban areas.
“Sometimes when people think of national parks, they think of Yosemite or they think of mountain ranges out west,” Barnum said. “This a prime example of how the National Park Service brings recreation and access to public lands right in the middle of a big city and how we preserve the historic nature of the area.”
NPS Chief of Planning, Compliance and Geographic Information Systems Tammy Stidham said environmental concerns are minimal and said the project should not have adverse effects on the Georgetown Waterfront Park or the wildlife living there.
“We don’t envision there being adverse impacts to wildlife and most of the vegetation is invasive, Stidham said. “Most of the work will be on the shoreline to make the shoreline a bit more vegetative and resilient.”
Weiss said he does not believe the project should be stopped, but the NPS should take action in preventing environmental risks to the area.
“I believe in connecting people to nature, but it has to go hand in hand with a plan to educate and help people learn to be careful and appreciate the sensitivity of nature in that zone, because it is pretty amazing the damage one person can do if they are not careful,” Weiss said.
Stidham said the NPS has no current plans to educate the visiting public on how to maintain the environment along the recreational zone.
Weiss said greater public education on pollution and land use could minimize detrimental effects along the river.
“Try to create a little appreciation and sensitivity as they participate in this very fragile slither of natural area in the middle of our city — it’s an urban river, and so there are people here, but you’re going to lose that little slither of nature unless you’re careful,” Weiss said.
Stidham said though a boat zone was not originally included in the Georgetown Waterfront Park, the need for boat access has posed a problem since the park opened. Stidham added that the NPS will be working in coordination with District Department of Transportation as well as the public. DDOT will build new sidewalks, a bike lane and perform work on the roadway.
“It’s a balance between providing visitors access to the river but still protecting the national resources,” Stidham said. “We feel like the plan not only represents what the Park Service would like to do there, but what the community would like to see happen.”

Two Washington D.C. Public Schools closed last week after bedbug infestations forced school officials to cancel classes or move students to other facilities.
DCPS officials found bedbugs at both Myrtilla Miner Elementary School in Northeast Washington and Savoy Elementary School in Anacostia.
At Savoy, the school was closed Feb. 6 to clean the facilities and replace all infested rugs, cots, blankets and pillows in the building.
According to The Washington Post, students missed classes for two days before temporarily attending classes at Ferebee-Hope Elementary School.
DCPS Chancellor Antwan Wilson sent a letter to Savoy Elementary School parents Feb. 3 assuring them the school would be cleaned and that DCPS was working to address the infestation.
“At Savoy Elementary School, we are committed to ensuring all students and staff are safe, and that the school environment is conducive to learning,” Wilson wrote in the letter.
At Miner, teachers found bedbugs on students’ clothing Feb. 9, 14 and 15, though school has still not been cancelled.
Miner Principal Andrea Mial said in a letter sent to parents Wednesday that the school was working to ensure the safety of students and staff.
“Here at Miner Elementary School, it is my priority to ensure that all students and staff are safe and the school environment is conducive to teaching and learning,” Mial wrote.
According to Orkin, a pest control and exterminator services, the District and Baltimore ranked first and second, respectively, as the top cities for bedbugs in 2016. The company ranked cities around the country based on the number of treatments for bedbugs conducted between December 2015 and Nov. 30, 2016. The report included both commercial and residential properties.
D.C. rose to second place from its third place ranking last year.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, bedbugs have developed a resistance to many pesticides.
District Department of Health spokesperson Jasmine Gossett said though the department provides District residents with information about bedbug infestations, they have no centralized services dedicated to helping combat infestation because they do not spread disease.
Gossett said bedbugs spread around rapidly, as they hitchhike on their human hosts to new destinations where they hide away until ready to feed again.
National Pest Management Association spokesperson Cindy Mannes said college campuses can be especially vulnerable to bedbug outbreaks, as they spread where people live in close proximity and share clothing, blankets and other fabrics.
“College dorms are a place where we find bedbugs,” Mannes said. “They multiply very quickly and are great hitchhikers, so if they are in one dorm room and they go on someone’s clothing, they can end up in another room as well.”
Mannes suggested that students not purchase secondhand furniture or mattresses to stop the spread of bedbugs.
Ed Koh (NHS ’19) said he was surprised to hear about the growing rates of bedbugs in the District, having bought and used secondhand furniture in his dorm room.
“My experience has been fine so far, but I guess if you’re going to buy and use secondhand stuff, you should be aware of the risks,” Koh said.
