A group of descendants of the 272 slaves whose sale in 1838 benefitted Georgetown University is seeking to establish a $1 billion foundation in partnership with the university and the Jesuits of Maryland to fund scholarships for descendants a week after University President John J. DeGioia announced they would receive an edge in the university admissions process.
The group formed a foundation called GU272 to push the university to pursue a collaborative approach as it seeks to reconcile its history with slavery. Over 500 descendants support the foundation.
On Sept. 1, DeGioia announced that descendants of the 272 would be given the same consideration in admissions as legacies, and released a report — including a series of recommendations — by the Working Group on Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation as well as a series of other measures to begin reconciling Georgetown’s history with slavery.
DeGioia announced the university would offer a formal apology in a Mass of Reconciliation held with the Archdiocese of Washington and the Society of Jesus in the United States, establish an Institute for the Study of Slavery and Its Legacies, increase engagement with descendants of the 272 and seek to increase diversity at the university.
The university will also rename Freedom and Remembrance Halls as Isaac Hall — named after the first enslaved person named in records of the 1838 sale — and Anne Marie Becraft Hall — named after a Catholic sister and educator in the Georgetown neighborhood during the 19th century.
DeGioia approved the working group recommendation to change the names of then-recently opened Mulledy and McSherry Halls to Freedom and Remembrance Halls, respectively, within 24 hours of a student-led demonstration last November. Mulledy and McSherry Hall were named after former University Presidents Fr. Thomas Mulledy, S.J. — who authorized the sale of the slaves to a Louisiana plantation in 1838 — and Fr. William McSherry, S.J., who served as a lawyer in the sale.
Descendants who spoke with The Hoya were concerned that they were not adequately included in the decision process. Six descendants presented a declaration at the Gaston Hall event on Thursday that has been signed by over 350 descendants, expressing their desire to work with the Georgetown community to reconcile Georgetown’s history with slavery.
Joe Stewart, a descendant of the 272 who presented the declaration at the event, said at the event the university has to collaborate with descendants in order to make sure its efforts are effective.
“This is perhaps one of the greatest needs in this nation, at Georgetown, among the Jesuits, and throughout the human family,” Stewart said. “And this university has the gravitas to do that, but you got to listen. And one of the things that has not happened, the reason we rushed to Washington today to participate here, is because we want you to hear.”
Karran Harper Royal, a lead organizer for GU272 and a descendant of the 272, said while the lack of inclusion of descendants in the report process was disappointing, it does not put future progress at risk.
“It was not handled well at all but we can certainly move on from that, because we do recognize that this was a first step and we appreciate this first step,” Harper Royal said in an interview with The Hoya.
She stressed that the foundation sees offering scholarships as a necessary expansion of the university’s plan to offer legacy status to descendants.
“There’s value in that but still schooling has to be paid for,” Harper Royal said. “And we really want to through the foundation provide for the educational aspirations of descendants, regardless of whether they choose Georgetown or any other institution that might better fit their needs.”
DeGioia said in a statement to The Hoya that feedback from the descendant community and other stakeholders is important as the university seeks to make progress.
“We are encouraged by feedback from our campus community, from the descendant community, from our alumni, and from many other stakeholders,” DeGioia said. “This is the phase now where we ask people to engage with the findings and recommendations of the Working Group as we work together to develop a long-term framework for memory and reconciliation.”
History Professor David Collins, S.J., who led the working group, said he believes the working group successfully fulfilled its mandate.
“The working group was convened for one academic year. I think the sixteen-member Working Group fulfilled their mandate very well; and I’m getting exactly that positive feedback in the national and international media,” Collins wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Descendants emerged as important participants in the conversation over the course of the year. We were in conversation with descendants over the course of the year.”
The descendants have so far raised $115,000 – equal to Georgetown’s asking price for the 272 slaves – in seed-funding for the foundation. The foundation expects to work with the university and the Maryland Jesuits to find philanthropic donors for the rest of the fund.
Neither the university nor the Maryland Jesuits have responded to the foundation’s request to collaborate as of 2:30 a.m., according to Harper Royal.
The exact structure of foundation has not yet been decided.
“I think we want to talk with Georgetown and work together to really think about how the foundation’s going to form, but I think because of the way Georgetown submitted and released the working group report, we have to sort of use those recommendations and try thinking about they fit within a framework that we as descendants would like to move forward with and try to put that in the context of the foundation,” Melissa Kemp, a descendant of one of the slaves, said.
Harper Royal said the descendants hope to collaborate with the university as much as possible moving forward.
“We feel that we have a broad base of voices in agreement with what is in the declaration and it’s not opposite of some of the recommendations,” Harper Royal said. “But they certainly do complement the recommendations, so all we’re saying is that we need to partner in carrying out whatever is going to be the path forward. So that’s where we’re at, we want to partner.”
Correction: This article previously stated Georgetown University sold the 272 slaves to a Louisiana plantation in 1838; Georgetown only benefitted from the sale.

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg addressed first-year law students Sept. 7 at the Georgetown University Law Center before opening the floor up to questions from the audience, paying tribute to her late colleague Justice Antonin Scalia (CAS ’57) and reflecting on her commitment to gender equality throughout her career.
In his introduction of the justice, GULC Dean William M. Treanor praised Ginsburg — who has served on the Supreme Court for nearly 23 years — for championing social change and gender equality.
“She occupies a rare space in legal history. Like Justice Thurgood Marshall, Justice Ginsburg would’ve been a historic figure in her case for her work as an advocate for gender equality — she would’ve been a historic figure even if she’d never been a judge,” Treanor said.
Ginsburg has long had a relationship with GULC, where her husband was a longtime member of the faculty until his death in 2010. She spoke to the graduating class of 2015 in February and again at an alumni event in May.
Ginsburg opened the program Thursday by remembering Scalia, who died in October 2015, highlighting the ways in which he influenced her while they worked together on the D.C. Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals and for her entire tenure in the Supreme Court, prior to his death.
“Indeed whenever I wrote with the court and received a Scalia dissent, the majority opinion ultimately released was clearer and more convincing than my original circulation. Justice Scalia honed in on all the soft spots and energized me to strengthen the court’s decision,” she said.
Ginsburg discussed Scalia’s caring nature throughout their friendship, sharing an anecdote from the Bush v. Gore decision, which ruled in favor of George W. Bush in his disputed victory during 2000’s presidential election. Scalia concurred with the majority opinion while Ginsburg wrote a dissent.
“I was in chambers, exhausted after the marathon. Around 9:00 p.m. on Tuesday night, the telephone, my direct line, rang. It was Justice Scalia. He didn’t say, as he often did, ‘Get over it.’ Instead he asked, ‘Ruth, why are you still at the court? Go home and take a hot bath,’” Ginsburg said.
Ginsburg further reflected on the two justices’ unlikely friendship and collegiality.
“Among my favorite Scalia stories — when President Clinton was mulling over his first nomination to the Supreme Court, Justice Scalia was asked a question to this effect: ‘If you were stranded on a desert island with your new court colleague, whom would you prefer, Larry Tribe or Mario Cuomo?’ Scalia answered without hesitation, ‘Ruth Bader Ginsburg,’” Ginsburg said.
Despite their glaring ideological differences, the two were famously close friends.
“Once asked how we could be friends given our disagreement on lots of things, Justice Scalia answered: ‘I attack ideas, I don’t attack people,’” Ginsburg said. “Some very good people have some very bad ideas, and if you can’t separate the two, then you’ve got to get yourself another day job.”
Ginsburg went on to praise Scalia’s work ethic and personality, sharing details about their time together as colleagues and friends.
“I miss the challenges and the laughter Justice Scalia provoked. His pungent, eminently quotable opinions, so clearly stated that his words rarely slip from the reader’s grasp, the roses he brought me on my birthday,” Ginsburg said. “The court is a paler place without him.”
After speaking about Scalia, Ginsburg shifted her speech to a conversation on her advocacy efforts for gender equality as an attorney, such as discrimination in the workplace, unpaid maternity leave for teachers without right of return and lack of family insurance coverage for blue collar women.
“It dawned on me how lucky I was to be born when I was and to be a lawyer, because it was the first time in the history of the United States that it became possible for legislators and judges to respond to the arbitrary gender lines,” she said. “Whatever we were saying in the 70s had been said generations before, but said at a time when society was not yet ready to listen.”
The event concluded with a question-and-answer session for first-year law students, during which Ginsburg was asked if she believes there has been substantial progress in gender inequality issues, particularly in law.
“I am amazed at how quick the progress has been. I think back to the days when I was one of nine women students in an entry class of over 500,” Ginsburg said. “The direction of change is right. Sometimes people ask me, ‘So now there are three of you, when do you think you’ll have enough women in the Supreme Court?’ and I think, frankly, at nine.”
Ginsburg further lauded the strides made in gender inequality issues in her career, but called attention to the difficulties of balancing a career and home life as a working mother along with the unconscious biases that still prompt discrimination in the workplace.
Whitney Greer (GRD ’19) said she found Ginsburg’s friendship with Scalia to be poignant in an era brimming with political discord.
“It was a very valuable topic of conversation because she stressed the importance, particularly in law, which is sort of fundamentally a conflict-based profession, about maintaining professional and personal relationships aside from political conflict. And even as we have polarizing views, the importance of still recognizing the humanity in another person and still valuing them and their opinions,” Greer said. “I thought it was great she used this platform to honor him that way.”
In his comments, Treanor underscored Ginsburg’s influence in everyday culture.
“The justice is a cultural icon. How many of us can say that they have inspired a one-act opera, two coloring books and the phenomenon known as the Notorious RBG?” Treanor said.

A year after the university published a memorandum of understanding addressing sexual assault on campus — a three months after the university released the results of its climate survey in which over a 1,000 female undergraduates reported nonconsensual sexual contact while at Georgetown – administrators and advocates highlight the university’s progress toward fulfilling the goals set in the MOU.
The university and Georgetown University Student Association reached a memorandum of understanding mid-September of last year following two months of negotiations, which committed to advancing sexual assault policy reform, increasing bystander intervention training and promotional material for survivors, hiring of a full-time Title IX coordinator and carrying out a Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey.
The university fulfilled several of its promises, including hiring Laura Cutway in January to serve as the university’s first full-time Title IX coordinator, as well as conducting the university’s first-ever campuswide Sexual Assault and Misconduct Survey.
Notably, Counseling and Psychiatric Services now provides a semester’s worth of free appointments to survivors of sexual assault.
The university also changed the definition of dating violence in the Student Code of Conduct, and emergency resources were added to GOCards as well as on the doors of campus bathroom stalls.
Despite this progress, GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff Olivia Hinerfeld (SFS ’17) said the university did miss certain deadlines on the MOU’s requirements.
“While some of the projects and initiatives took longer than the specific timelines called for, university administrators consistently made an effort to be transparent and to push forward on the various asks outlined in the MOU,” Hinerfeld said.
The need for greater sexual assault reform became particularly apparent after the survey revealed that 31 percent, or 1,131 students, of surveyed female Georgetown students reported nonconsensual sexual contact and 14.1 percent reported nonconsensual penetration during their time at Georgetown.
Former GUSA President Joe Luther (COL ’16), who helped lead negotiations of the MOU, also pointed to the viewpoint “I Stand With Willa,” published in The Hoya last June, one of two pieces published in The Hoya written by sexual assault survivors about their experiences, as a catalyst for the change.
“The piece highlighted a lot of areas where the university was failing to care for survivors of sexual assault,” Luther said. “The resulting document came about through a series of meetings between student activists and senior administrators throughout the summer and beginning of the year.”
GUSA Sexual Assault and Safety Chair Maddy Moore (SFS ’17) praised the MOU as an “incredibly helpful template” for the university to meet necessary goals over the past year.
Cutway said the MOU helped to define shared goals for the administration and students to address.
“The committee met regularly and made great strides in furthering our support of all individuals involved in sexual misconduct on campus,” Cutway said.
However, Cutway said the university needs to continue increasing dialogue regarding sexual assault at Georgetown.
“This is our moment to fully create the campus we respect and want to be a part of, one that doesn’t tolerate sexual assault or misconduct but one that fairly and transparently supports all individuals involved,” Cutway said. “It takes every member of our community to create a culture shift and to raise awareness.”
Beyond increasing awareness of the issue, Moore stressed that the university needs to clarify what constitutes sexual assault.
“There needs to be clearer language around what encompasses a sexual assault, especially in regards to dating violence and stalking,” Moore said.
Hinerfeld pointed to bystander education and awareness as areas that need more attention.
“We need to follow up on President DeGioia’s commitment to fund bystander education for all students,” Hinerfeld said. “This will require developing and operationalizing new curricula and building relationships with stakeholder organizations.”
Luther said while Georgetown had made strides in responding to the needs of survivors, the university should increase emphasis on assault prevention.
“A lot of the provisions in the MOU are about how to best care for students after an assault occurs. It would be infinitely preferable that the assault doesn’t happen in the first place,” Luther said. “I think one of the most important questions, yet difficult ones to answer, is ‘How do you create a culture of consent?’ I believe this will without a doubt continue to be the focus of Georgetown and GUSA for many years to come.”

Activist and author Alveda King, who is the niece of Martin Luther King Jr., advocated the importance of respecting all forms of human life in an event entitled “Civil Rights for the Unborn,” held in the Copley Formal Lounge on Tuesday.
Over 20 people attended the event, which was co-sponsored by Georgetown Right to Life, Georgetown University Women of Color and the Georgetown University Lecture Fund.
After opening remarks, King showed two videos: a trailer for her latest book, “King Rules,” and a music video with a montage of photos of the King family and its involvement in the civil rights movement.
King shared her personal history, which included her own birth as a result of an unplanned pregnancy and a discussion of her own two abortions, saying she hoped her story will be able create new opportunities for conversation.
“I find that when I tell my own testimony, it opens up opportunities for discussion,” King said.
According to King, abortion was illegal at the time of her conception. However, the American Birth Control League, which would later become Planned Parenthood, offered sterilization opportunities and information to young people on college campuses.
King said she agonized over her own two abortions, both of which were kept secret. Both abortions occurred in the 1970s.
“Between the drugs, the shots, the pills — through the years I had several procedures and was sad and depressed,” she said.
King considered herself pro-abortion rights but she said she changed her mind after her first ultrasound during her third pregnancy. At the time, she was considering getting another abortion.
“I saw my first ultrasound, and that baby was younger than the two who had been aborted. And I just thought ‘Oh my god, it’s a baby!’” King said.
Regarding her current anti-abortion stance, King echoed the words of her uncle and talked about his beliefs regarding nonviolence and social activism.
“He said, ‘Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.’ If we forsake respect for the human personality, we’re in trouble,” King said. “When we regard the human personality, we won’t kill anybody, we won’t trample anybody, we won’t oppress anybody.”
King said she views all aspects of the anti-abortion advocacy platform as holding equal importance. King said asserting one method of advocacy’s importance over the other is not helpful for the anti-abortion movement.
“Tonight I can’t even tell you what’s most important because to me it all goes together,” King said. “Arguing about which method is the best becomes extremely divisive to the pro-life cause as a whole.”
King said it would be a mistake to take a strong hardline stance against women seeking abortions and a bigger effort should be made to learn more about their situations.
“You can’t just say ‘Don’t abort the baby, it’s murder and God will be mad at you,’” King said. “What happens to that mother that becomes pregnant and is hopeless? Or how was she in that position? And what about the dad who maybe does want the abortion or doesn’t?”
King said mothers can still make choices about their body as a parent and that the parent’s life and the fetus’ life must be considered equal.
“Women can be empowered and still make healthy choices about motherhood,” King said. “They should sing together in concert. One should never overpower the other.”
President of the Georgetown Right to Life club Amelia Irvine (COL ’19) said she thought King’s past and family connections made the discussion stand out.
“I thought it was a really unique perspective that Alveda could bring with her personal history mixed in with her family’s famous past,” Irvine said.
Richard Howell (SFS ’19), who attended the event, said he found value in King relating her own experience with abortion.
“Her perspective having had two abortions was interesting,” Howell said. “She understood the choice and the pressures behind making that choice.”

Former United States State Department Coordinator for Counterterrorism Ambassador Daniel Benjamin and CNN National Security analyst Peter Bergen discussed the declining threat of foreign terrorism and the need to avoid Islamophobia on Wednesday evening, ahead of the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
Senior Associate Dean for Undergraduate Affairs Daniel Byman moderated the Lecture Fund-sponsored event, titled “Looking Back, Looking Forward,” in White-Gravenor Hall.
Benjamin and Bergen offered a big-picture assessment of terrorism and counterterrorism both before and after the terrorist attacks.
Bergen said that the threat of terrorism immediately following the Sept. 11 attacks seemed much larger and more imminent than what it actually materialized into, largely because of the anthrax attacks that immediately followed.
“If we had this conversation in 2002 and I predicted that in the next decade and a half 94 Americans would be killed by Jihadi terrorists by 2016, that would have seemed an absurdly optimistic prediction,” Bergen said.
Bergen said that although many Americans are pessimistic about the state of terrorism in America today, the U.S. government’s response to the problem has been effective.
“I mean, you are 3000 times more likely to be killed by a fellow American with a gun in this country than you are to be killed by a Jihadi terrorist,” Bergen said.
Bergen explained that the attack, although seemingly a victory for al-Qaida, actually in the long run hurt the group.
“9/11 was a great tactical victory for al-Qaida, but it was a total strategic failure,” Bergen said. “[Bin Laden] made an enormously counterintuitive leap of logic that if we were attacked in Washington and New York then we would pull out of the Middle East. Well, quite the contrary happened — we got rid of the Taliban within three months.”
The threat of foreign terrorism in the U.S. has been successfully mitigated, according to Bergen, but he emphasized the current risk is from attacks from American citizens.
“Since [May 1, 2010] the threat in the United States has been entirely homegrown and so when you hear Donald Trump talk about the threat from refugees or immigrants, this is total nonsense,” Bergen said. “Every lethal terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11 has been carried out by an American citizen or by a legal permanent resident.”
Benjamin attributed gaps in counterterrorism efforts to a lack of training and knowledge in special operations forces.
Benjamin said counterterrorism before 9/11 was simply not a primary priority for policymakers, but that since then, great improvements have been made.
“If you looked at the way the nation established its security priorities, terrorism was what we would call a Tier Three threat and now it is a Tier Zero threat,” Benjamin said. “In the interim we have had a complete and astonishing revolution in capabilities by the military.”
Benjamin pointed to a popular view of counterterrorism that has become highly politicized and a cause for divisiveness and finger-pointing rather than unity and resilience.
“It has created the implication in many people’s minds that we can have zero casualties,” Benjamin said. “That’s been a terrible disservice to the nation, that we have politicized it.”
Benjamin also lamented the growing fear of Islam and its popular association with terrorism in the U.S.
“The other thing that has gone terribly wrong is the way that our politics has evolved to embrace Islamophobia. There is no one who works in counterterrorism, [or] who has in a long time, who doesn’t see the embrace of Muslim communities, and the collaboration with them,” Benjamin said.
Byman said the two panelists were among the few experts in the field who could make such retrospective, long-term comparisons.
“If you turn on television today you know that really everyone and their mother is a terrorism expert, right?” Byman said. “The industry must be of supposed experts, but it’s probably thousands of people. The actual number of people who were following terrorism when 9/11 happened was exceptionally small and we have today two of the great names.”
Alfredo Carrillo (SFS ’20) said he agreed with the panelists’ arguments in favor of the government’s counterterrorism strategy.
“They really had convincing arguments to show that counterterrorism efforts by the United States have been effective and that even though there is a lot of work to be done with regards to this matter, there is a reason to be optimistic about it,” Carillo said.

The Office of Global Services did not host the international pre-orientation program for the second year running, instead choosing to run the program as part of New Student Orientation in an effort to ensure that international students fully integrate into the university community.
OGS is committing to the program for four more years with the potential for further extension if students support the change.
According to OGS Director of International Student and Scholar Services Rachel Rubin, the decision to eliminate IPO as its own program was not financially motivated but driven by feedback from the international community at Georgetown. Rubin said OGS wanted to ensure that students did not get confined to one international friend group.
“It’s really the surveys we have from the international students’ community, which say that by the end of four years, they wish they had met more Americans,” Rubin said. “So we weighed the decision to bring them in early so you have more time to adjust versus you create a friend group that prejudices you against New Student Orientation and makes it so you don’t need to integrate on your floor and so you don’t really need the rest of the Georgetown community.”
The international parent orientation, which includes information specific to international students such as immigration compliance, will remain.
Although the core of previous IPO programming is included in the NSO schedule, IPO is not officially acknowledged as part of NSO, according to Emma Barnitt (MSB ’17), a NSO 2016 coordinator.
“We are not affiliated with any pre-orientation program specifically,” Barnitt said.
Rubin said she hopes the change will eliminate the cliques of international students that have formed in the past and allow them to better integrate into life at Georgetown.
“What we want is one Hoya community, not an international student community that is separated,” Rubin said. “We want them to feel good with each other as internationals and then we want them to be Hoyas.”
Natalia Peña (COL ’17), who is from the Philippines, participated in IPO her freshman year and credits the shared experience with many of her strongest friendships.
“That’s how I made most of my close friends. They were going through the same struggle I was, having family so far away and adjusting to a new culture,” Peña said. “I was going through a different adjustment compared to someone who was just moving from a different state. Having people who shared the same struggle as me really eased my entrance into the Georgetown experience.”
While Peña said she understands that IPO can foster cliques, she said combining it with NSO might rob incoming international students of a foundational bonding opportunity.
“It really helped to have those few extra days of adjustment because NSO is so overwhelming,” Peña said. “I do agree that sometimes the bubble created by IPO isolates internationals but I think that’s also a choice that people get to make.”

The Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service will host National Security Advisor Susan Rice in Gaston Hall on Sept. 14 as part of the first installment in a six-part lecture series entitled “The Exit Interview,” which will focus on the legacy of President Barack Obama’s presidency.
The series will include appearances from an array of Obama administration officials involved in various areas of public policy.
GU Politics Executive Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94) said the Obama years are worth examining because they reshaped American domestic and foreign policy.
“As this presidency enters its home stretch, and we begin to prepare for a new administration to take over, we are thrilled to lead at Georgetown a national conversation about the Obama years, their successes and failures, and their lasting impact,” Elleithee said in a press release.
The series, which will run through January, will include discussions on national security and foreign policy, criminal and social justice, climate change, the economy, health care reform and the political culture in Washington, D.C.
“Even as we are focused on running through the tape in January, this is a perfect time to reflect on the progress under President Obama, from making climate change a global issue, to strengthening our place in the world to bringing our economy back from the brink,” White House Communications Director Jen Psaki said in a press release. “And this is an opportunity for some of the cabinet members and senior officials who have been at the helm to engage in a discussion about the opportunities and challenges that remain in the coming months and for the next administration.”
The events, which will be hosted in a variety of formats, will include segments for members of the Georgetown community to ask the speakers questions.
“The Exit Interview” will also feature contributions from Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew (LAW ’83) and Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Matthews Burwell. GU Politics has not yet announced the guest it will be hosting for the lecture on the political culture in the District.
In order to facilitate discussions and opening remarks, the series will rely on political and policy experts at Georgetown as well as other high-profile journalists and political commentators.  Following each installment of “The Exit Interview,” GU Politics will also host a series of events featuring prominent guests with viewpoints opposing those held by the Obama administration.

Security guards will no longer monitor dorms overnight, in an effort by the Georgetown University Policy Department and the Office of Residential Living to re-appropriate funds toward closed-circuit TV camera maintenance and other security expenses.
Security guards will now monitor dormitories from a new Security Operations Center —located in the Mezzanine Level of the Southwest Quad Parking Garage—between 12:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. seven nights a week via live feeds from security cameras located in dormitory lobbies, entrances and hallways.
In previous years, Allied Barton security personnel have checked GOCards in residence halls from midnight to 8:00 a.m., at which point student guards took over and worked in shifts throughout the day.
Currently, there are two specially trained Allied Barton personnel monitoring the cameras during the night hours.
GUPD Chief Jay Gruber said the guards underwent an intensive weeklong course at the University of Maryland during which they specialized in examining live feeds effectively and identifying suspicious behavior.
“We’re training these officers to work both reactively and proactively,” Gruber said. “So if they see someone looking around the lobby who isn’t really going anywhere, they’ll call down from the Security Operations Center, and we will respond.”
Security guards on shift in the Security Operations Center are required to submit updates on what they have observed every 15 minutes to ensure that the halls are continually supervised.
Gruber said he hopes to use the money saved from staffing overnight shifts to fund security system maintenance. Gruber could not specify the amount of money saved as of 2:30 a.m..
“When cameras died in the past, I had to go shop around and find somebody to give me money for it, which often took months or years,” Gruber said. “I’ve made the investment, and now I can’t just let that investment dry up. I have to make sure everything is working properly.”
Some of the funds will also be directed to the Security Operations Center, which Gruber hopes to eventually staff more heavily and run 24 hours a day.
The student guard program will remain unchanged for the 2016-17 academic year, according to Gruber. However, he expressed interest in eventually expanding the role of student guards: for example, having them monitor cameras during the day.
The Office of Residential Living and GUPD also installed cameras in and around every residence hall, primarily in lobbies and doorways, as well as alarm systems sensitive to the activity of residence hall perimeter doors. Newer residence halls, such as Ryan and Freedom Halls and Pedro Arrupe, S.J. Hall, have cameras mounted at every entry and exit, and, if a door is held or propped open for too long, the department receives a notification and can send a police officer to investigate.
Furthermore, every residence hall, with the exceptions of Copley Hall and LXR Hall, is now equipped with a double barrier system that requires students and other authorized personnel to swipe their GOCards twice: first to enter the building, and once again to access elevators or stairways.
This system is likely to be implemented in LXR by the end of the semester, but security officers will continue checking GOCards in the lobby throughout the night due to its off-campus location, according to Gruber.
Additionally, Gruber said access to residence halls during the day has been limited to students, police officers, Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Services, facilities personnel, chaplains and faculty-in-residence.
Gruber emphasized the importance of student involvement in campus security, especially in closing doors behind them at night to prevent unknown individuals from following students into residence halls without using GOCards, a process known as tailgating. He said students should use the LiveSafe app to notify the police department if someone tries to tailgate into a building or exhibits suspicious behavior.
“We really count on our students to take a stake in their own security and use common sense,” Gruber said. “You have to think of the residence hall as your home. Would you let somebody into your house or your apartment building who you didn’t know?”
Marcos Morales (COL ’19) said he was concerned that a lack of an authority figure who could stop students who appear to be drunk from going back to a dorm room together could be dangerous.
“I’m worried that it’s getting rid of a potential way to prevent sexual assault,” Morales said.
Alexandra Williams (SFS ’19) said the university should continue to make student safety a priority, taking advantage of both video cameras and overnight guards.
“Tuition increases should mean more money is going towards practicalities,” Williams said. “If the department sees the benefit in adding cameras, then they should employ both methods of security.”
However, Will Davis (COL ’19) said he doubts the change will greatly affect students.
“It’s basically impossible to access campus dorms without a GOCard in the first place,” Davis said. “And I’ve seen plenty of guards asleep at the desk at 4:00 in the morning, so I’m not sure how much of a difference this will make.”

The Office of Residential Living increased laundry rates by 25 cents to $1.75 per load of laundry this summer —the first price increase in four years—in an effort to keep up with rising maintenance costs, according to a campuswide email from the Office of Residential Living on Sept. 1.
A full load of washing and drying now costs $3.50, an increase of over 15 percent. Neighboring D.C. institutions such as The George Washington University and American University match Georgetown’s new rate at $1.75 per load of laundry.
According to the Assistant Dean for Residential Living Stephanie Lynch, new laundry room equipment and increasing maintenance costs caused the rate increase.
“The laundry prices have been stable, as there have been no increases in price in the last four years,” Lynch said. “The increase was to help pay for new laundry room GOCard readers and offset other maintenance cost increases.”
The laundry machines in the Southwest Quad were all replaced over the summer, and a new technician was added to the team in response to student concerns during the previous academic year. In addition, new GOCard readers were installed in laundry rooms around campus.
Kate Amarell (COL ’18), a resident assistant in Nevils Hall, said that the price increase could add additional financial burdens on students.
“From the perspective of an RA, it’s really important that we keep these amenities accessible for students,” Amarell said. “Laundry costs should not be a cause of stress for the residents, and I definitely feel like they may be becoming one.”
Nikhil Mendiratta (MSB ’19), however, said the increase in price is worth the improved service quality, especially in the new Pedro S. Arrupe, S.J. Residence Hall.
“I’m happy to pay a little extra for an improvement in functionality — which I’ve actually seen since I’m living in Arrupe this year (the machines are all new),” Mendiratta wrote in an email to The Hoya.
