American values are not always so dissimilar from those in conservative Muslim countries, posits Gary Wasserman (SFS ’66), a former professor of government at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Doha, Qatar, in his recent book reflecting on his experiences living and working in Doha.
Wasserman taught from 2006 to 2014, joining the SFS-Q faculty just one year after the institution opened its doors.
Since his return to the United States from Doha, Wasserman has dedicated his time to writing his book, “The Doha Experiment: Arab Kingdom, Catholic College, Jewish Teacher,” which was published Nov. 14 and discusses his eight years in the region.
Wasserman highlights his efforts to reach across boundaries and describes his experience administering a liberal education in a region of the world unfamiliar to many Americans. Through personal anecdotes, Wasserman discusses not only the lessons he sought to teach but also how his interactions with his students changed his own understanding of the world.
The Hoya sat down with Wasserman to learn more about his experience abroad.
You have previously mentioned the unusual nature of teaching as a Jewish professor at a Catholic school in a predominantly Muslim country, so what inspired you to go to Qatar? 
I had been working mostly in Washington as a political consultant, then I taught for a year in China, and I enjoyed the experience of teaching overseas. It was frankly easier to get a job overseas, and I also thought this would be an interesting, challenging opportunity. Now, unfortunately, when I told my family and friends about this, they all looked at me like I was crazy, you know?
This was a few years after 9/11, and a Jewish professor going to the Middle East to teach sounded to many of them like an act of lunacy, and I began to wonder about my own sanity. I talk in the book about how you have to start out with a kind of “You’re going to do what?” to getting to know real people on the ground and finding that the categories that we use for understanding people we don’t know very well tend to fall away.
Your book talks about the tension between Qatar’s traditional society and Georgetown’s mission of liberal education. Can you elaborate on that?
Georgetown was set up for foreign service, essentially to educate bureaucrats in becoming administrators, but Georgetown itself — the administrators and teachers — saw themselves as providing a liberal education.
Grounding in philosophy and economics and history and politics, which was more oriented to educating the whole person, they weren’t trying to train students into a certain profession. They were trying to educate young people in this tradition of liberal education. There was that disagreement and a kind of implicit misunderstanding, but I think the Qataris and the Qatari leaders were very welcoming of what Georgetown was doing, including courses like the “Problem of God” for instance, and respecting Georgetown’s scholars’ willingness to take on what they were doing. They gave Georgetown a lot of scope to do what they were going to do.
You also talked about how Qatar was very different from its other Middle Eastern counterparts in terms of its willingness to globalize and its acceptance of Western cultural attitudes. Do you think that these schools that are coming in are a positive force in this regard? 
Qatar and many of the nations are in flux. They’re very much sorting through what parts of their tradition they want to retain and what parts have to be adapted to the modern world. We’re not exactly the epitome of liberal societies now in the world. I think all countries adapt themselves in different ways to different pressures, different interests and different values. They are going through that adaptation, and I think they’re doing it with the resources they have. They have a lot of resources, a lot of money, and they have an enlightened leadership that I think understands that Qatar is going to prosper and survive in the world, and in the future they’re going to have to adapt to that globalized world.
Can you share one of those experiences that you thought was one of the more interesting ones you had there or that struck you? 
I had a student in one of my classes who was always kind of bringing up Israel or Zionism in an international relations class; it seemed to always go back to the question of the involvement of Zionists in a little bit of conspiratorial stuff he was thinking. And it came out frequently in class, and we talked about it in private, in quiet, and of course, he didn’t quite see it that way. I suggested he look more into the topic, but I didn’t think it was a very successful discussion that we had.
About a year or two later, he came back, and he had spent a semester at Georgetown’s main campus, and he had taken a class in Jewish civilization. He came back and he said, “You know, I never would have taken this class if I hadn’t been in your course.” It was one of those unexpected benefits. You have those kind of encounters that you don’t think are having an impact, but in fact, they do.
You mention you wanted this to be a positive, vital force in the region. Do you think we’re succeeding? 
I would say it’s incomplete. I think it’s succeeding in that it’s surviving and it’s adapting to the environment, and it’s succeeding in that it’s continuing to educate students. They’re continuing to graduate, and they’re continuing to think well of their experience at Georgetown and influencing the broader society.
I think it is succeeding. Whether it succeeds sufficiently and whether it is preserved remains to be seen, and part of it is how people kind of engage in what’s going on and spread some of the liberal ideas. Does press freedom expand in the society? Do women have more rights than they now have? There will be different markers, and I don’t think you go in there thinking your university is going to change the broader society or the broader region, but you do hope that over time, some of the ideas you’ve talked about have an impact.
What is something that you would like to see mentioned, or focused on more? 
I would like to see more interaction between the campuses. I’d like to see more people not interacting on the basis of religion, but just more connections between the main campus and Doha, between the very active Jewish civilization groups on the campus and more student activities between the campuses — a little bit of understanding of the students — because I think the students there have something to offer the main campus and vice versa, kind of getting away from these stereotypes, getting to know real people.
Is there anything you would like to add? Anything you think is important to you or to the book or to your experience in Doha?
What we’re doing in Doha is lowering walls. I think we came with the idea of being a modern missionary. We were going to deliver the truth in our campuses, and I think over time we’ve seen the importance of listening and trying to lower the walls a little bit between us and the rest of the region.

I did not know Gary very well when we were both undergraduates, except for the classes we shared and his role as the humor columnist for the East Campus student magazine.  I am very impressed with what he has done since we graduated, and especially with his work in Qatar, trying to “lower the walls” (in his phrase) between people of different cultures and political persuasions.

Washington, D.C. officials have begun to use dry ice as a new method to combat the District’s growing rat population, according to Gerard Brown, the program manager of the D.C. Department of Health’s rodent control division, earlier this month.
There was a 64 percent surge in rat sightings and complaints filed by D.C. residents to the 311 city services helpline in 2016. With the city’s rat population reaching a four-year high, the D.C. DOH continues to look for new ways to kill the rodents.
Its latest tool is dry ice, or the frozen form of carbon dioxide, which will be used in conjunction with the poison that city officials currently use in their pest control efforts. Dry ice suffocates the rats when it is placed in their nests, according to Brown.
“It’s just going to be another tool in our toolbox,” Brown said to The Washington Post on Jan. 3. “The CO2 that emanates from the dry ice suffocates the rats, and their homes become their graves.”
Despite Georgetown University’s rat population being similar to that of the District, there have been fewer calls for pest control this year, Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey told The Hoya in October. Morey attributed this trend to Georgetown’s improved response to the rodents.
Still, Georgetown students have expressed concern on social media regarding rat sightings in O’Donovan Hall and in residence halls in recent weeks. A post in an online Facebook group showing rats running around the second floor of Leo’s garnered 613 likes Jan. 13.
Planning and Facilities Management did not immediately respond to The Hoya’s request for a comment on whether Georgetown’s campus will begin to use dry ice.
The use of dry ice is part of an ongoing initiative by the D.C. DOH to combat the growing rat population. Previously, the District installed solar trash cans at a cost of $85,000 per year in areas where rats are found in high numbers.
According to D.C. Councilmember Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), new control initiatives are important, but the greater focus should be on keeping trash contained.
“We need [DOH] to be going as aggressive as they can,” Allen told The Washington Post on Jan. 3. “But it comes down to managing our trash the right way — not having food waste that is out in the alley.”
Officials are encouraging D.C. residents to purchase dry ice to kill the rodents, touting the agent’s relatively low price and ease of use. Tommy Wells, director of the D.C. Department of Energy and Environment, noted that dogs and cats are unlikely to consume the substance, making it a pet-friendly option.
Stephanie Bell, the senior director of cruelty casework for pro-animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said that dry ice is a better pest control option than many other common methods.
“[It’s] more humane than certain poisons and backbreaking or suffocating sticky glue traps,” Bell told The Washington Post on Jan. 3.
As D.C. begins to use dry ice to control the rat population in the District, officials hope to remove D.C. from the “Pest-iest States” list compiled by Terminix, which ranked Washington first in 2017.
Regardless of whether Georgetown University decides to use dry ice, it is very clear that students are not welcoming of their furry neighbors.
“Nothing’s worse than coming back from a late night in [Lauinger Library] and seeing a rat run through the lobby of your building,” Peter Hunziker (MSB ’20) wrote in an email to The Hoya.

Amazon Books’ first Washington, D.C. location is set to open on M Street in Georgetown as the latest installment in the tech giant’s foray into brick-and-mortar retail.
An Amazon representative declined to give details on the opening date of the store, which will be the 14th Amazon Books location nationwide. The storefront is located at 3040 M St. NW, a space previously occupied by Barneys New York. The 10,000-square-foot space is just under a mile from Georgetown University’s front gates.
With the exception of the Barnes & Noble bookstore on Georgetown University’s campus, the Amazon Books storefront will be the closest bookseller to campus marketing new books. The Lantern Bookshop on P Street and Books Used and Rare on Wisconsin Avenue are slightly closer, but only sell used books. The Amazon location will also sell Amazon electronic devices like e-reader Kindle and smart house assistant Echo.
Amazon Books is designed as a bookstore for the digital age. The shop is cashless and does not list prices on products like normal stores, in line with Amazon’s shifting prices – instead, customers can check prices at price check stations in the store or by scanning a book with the mobile Amazon shopping app. Amazon Prime customers are entitled to certain discounts.
Amazon uses customer data to help determine the products it offers at its bookstores, calculating a combination of Goodreads popularity, Amazon.com ratings, sales and customer pre-orders.
Nearly all the books sold in the stores have received over four stars on Amazon.com reviews; however, a quick search on Amazon.com reveals 3,968,154 results for all books rated over four stars. In addition to the algorithm, Amazon employs book curators to select books to stock in store.
Jennifer Cast, vice president of Amazon Books, has referred to the stocking approach as “data with heart.” Amazon Books curators aim to add an element of discovery to the shopping experience, according to Cast.
Micah Musser (COL ’19), president of the Tocqueville Forum Student Fellows, a student group that engages with political philosophy through weekly reading groups and talks by professors on their favorite works, said the group usually purchases its books through Amazon.
“It’s just the most convenient,” Musser said.
Nonetheless, the Tocqueville Forum Student Fellows shows used bookstore appreciation in its programming, hosting a local used bookstore tour at the end of every semester.
Despite Musser’s familiarity with Amazon, he has doubts that the company’s brick-and-mortar outpost will provide the same experience as D.C.’s local bookstores.
“I think one of the greatest allures of the local bookstores is that you don’t really know what you want when you go in,” Musser said. “There’s never really going to be an authentic surprise.”
Musser is not the only one hesitant about Amazon’s move into the physical world. Reviewers of the stores for The New Yorker, Chicago Tribune and The New York Times have all expressed discomfort at the new Amazon model.
A review in The New Yorker ran with the headline, “Amazon’s Brick-and-Mortar Bookstores Are Not Built for People Who Actually Read.” The Chicago Tribune noted the irony of Amazon’s initial crowding out of the physical bookstore market in favor of online shopping, only to later move into the brick-and-mortar space.
With the imminent arrival of Amazon Books, Georgetown may epitomize this phenomenon. The new location on M Street is next door to a Nike store that used to be a Barnes & Noble.
That Barnes & Noble closed in 2011 — the same year Amazon celebrated its fastest revenue growth since 2001, announced the launch of the Kindle Fire e-reader and purchased a rival British bookseller, Book Depository.
Seven years later, it is Amazon’s turn on the block.

SaxaFund, a crowdfunding platform for Georgetown University student initiatives launched last March, announced Thursday five campaigns it is sponsoring for donations on its new website.
The five projects include the Leavey Beergarden, a $3,000 concept that would turn part of the Leavey Esplanade into a social hub for drinking-age students with six beer hall tables, a heat lamp and a set of cornhole boards. A second project, Hilltop Compost, hopes to raise $1,215 to develop an independent composting service for campus events.
SaxaFund is also fundraising for a stipend program for off-campus mental health therapy as advocated by the Georgetown University Student Association, as well as for We for She, a project that aims to install free feminine hygiene product dispensers in all public on-campus restrooms.
Finally, the platform is sponsoring the Citizenship Scholarship, which will subsidize the citizenship process for four immigrant facilities workers. Started by the philanthropy branch of Students of Georgetown, Inc., the scholarship project has been operated since 2016 by The Corp’s Social Impact Committee, a team tasked to implement initiatives dedicated to philanthropic ventures that serve the wider campus community.
SaxaFund is a student-alumni collaboration between GUSA, the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union and The Corp. Projects on SaxaFund receive funding primarily from alumni donations. At press time, the five current projects have raised a total of $490.14. SaxaFund operates as an entity that is independent from the university.
Any Georgetown student or on-campus student organization can submit a project proposal to SaxaFund. The SaxaFund board is composed of students from The Corp, GUSA and GUASFCU, as well as Ann Yang (SFS ’16), Phil Wong (SFS ’15) and George Peacock (COL ’84), all of whom are alumni and faculty representatives. The board reviews and votes on the eligibility of the projects based on criteria established on the SaxaFund website.
A crucial criterion in the board’s evaluation is the magnitude of the project’s impact on the Georgetown community, according to Max Rosner (SFS ’18), executive director of SaxaFund.
Once the SaxaFund board selects a project to feature, it works with the teams behind the projects to ensure that their fundraising plans are feasible. Donations to projects are processed through PayPal and sent directly to SaxaFund’s bank account at GUASFCU, according to the SaxaFund website. SaxaFund then transfers the donations to the project team either after a project meets its goal or passes its deadline.
The fund enables effective and pertinent improvements for the Georgetown community, according to Rosner.
“Normally, GUSA, The Corp and GUASFCU all have their own interests, missions and approaches to improving campus,” Rosner wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Saxafund is so unique because it brings these groups to the table while still improving the campus in a really organic and grassroots way.”
The Citizenship Scholarship project is one of several proposals introduced by The Corp’s Philanthropy Committee that raises funds for other student groups, individuals or the university.
The Corp plans to source funding for the project from SaxaFund temporarily, until it can receive institutional support from the university, Corp CEO Melina Hsiao (COL ’18) said.
“We hope that the Citizenship Scholarship will be similarly supported by Georgetown; however, until this can be confirmed, we want to ensure we could continue to support this scholarship fund,” Hsiao said. “We thought that SaxaFund was the perfect platform for finding this support.”
While only five projects are currently live on the website, the platform plans to expand the campaigns offered once the financial goals of the current projects are reached, according to Rosner.
These five projects are not the first that SaxaFund has sponsored. Three student initiatives successfully received funding from online community donations through SaxaFund last year, including portable field lights for club sports teams, a student-produced film and a GUASFCU program for building credit history.
