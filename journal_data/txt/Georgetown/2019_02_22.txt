When students from top-floor apartments in Alumni Square were relocated to the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center last week, administrators assured them that they were acting with an abundance of caution.
However, university officials failed to act on water damage in Alumni Square they observed as early as last summer, according to an Alumni Square resident who had several conversations with senior university officials.
The Alumni Square relocation has intensified scrutiny of Georgetown’s maintenance and renovation process, exacerbating concerns about delayed responses to urgent safety issues, poor communication and negligence from university administrators. 
These challenges are not only frustrating, but life-threatening for students like former Alumni Square resident Sean Fulmer (SFS ’20). (Full disclosure: Fulmer is a staff writer for The Hoya).  
“I wasn’t told directly, but my roommate was [told] by a contractor that if we had been in the room when the ceiling collapsed that we would have died,” Fulmer said. 
A Feb. 11 notice gave 84 residents of top-floor apartments in Alumni Square four days to find off-campus housing or relocate to the Georgetown Hotel and Conference Center for the rest of the semester after structural engineers expressed concerns about moisture and pressure on Alumni Square roofs, according to a university webpage.
A university official may have known about water damage on roofs of Alumni Square apartments weeks before the first apartment in Alumni Square was ever inspected, Fulmer learned in conversations with Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and Chief Operating Officer Geoff Chatas. University officials did not comment on Fulmer’s claim.
Humeyra Selcukbiricik (COL ’20), who recounted the multiple health risks she encountered as a resident of campus housing in a Feb. 20 op-ed in The Hoya, is among the relocated students from Alumni Square, who feel neglected despite recent efforts to invest in deferred maintenance.
“We were just notified last minute as if we are objects that need to be moved to clear out the way,” Selcukbiricik said in an interview with The Hoya.
Delayed Reaction
Georgetown’s delay in addressing Alumni Square roof damage reflects student criticisms about the responsiveness of Georgetown’s work order system.
Inspections on the Alumni Square rooftops began after a maintenance inquiry in October 2018, according to a university webpage.
Fulmer and his roommates initiated that first inquiry for their top-floor apartment with a series of six phone calls and two work requests to the Office of Planning and Facilities Management, spanning from Sept. 10 to Oct. 2.
Within that three-week span last fall, facilities crews inspected his apartment’s collapsing roof three times, but the first two teams took no action to address the issue, according to Fulmer.
“The first time, they told us the carpentry department would be called and they’d come to work on it, and they never showed up,” Fulmer said. “The second time, they told us it was very serious and then never came back again.”
Understaffing and low wages for facilities workers are key factors behind delayed work requests, according to Chad Gasman (COL ’20), a residential assistant for McCarthy Hall.
“It’s not the facilities workers who are at fault, because they honestly try their best and they do the best they can with the amount of energy they’re given and the wages they’re given,” Gasman said in an interview with The Hoya. “It’s the fact that they’re not paid enough and the management isn’t doing enough to support them.”
Vice President of Planning and Facilities Management Benjamin Kuo did not answer questions regarding causes of delayed responses or whether facilities tracked response times to work orders. Instead, he referred students to the facilities website and encouraged feedback.
“We appreciate all feedback and from faculty, staff, students, parents, and others and take their input very seriously when considering how to improve our service to the community,” Kuo wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Unprepared For Emergency
When dorms pose an immediate health or safety threat to residents, emergency housing may not be guaranteed. When a third facilities crew arrived at Fulmer’s apartment Oct. 2, they told Fulmer and his roommates their ceiling was about to collapse and they needed to evacuate that night, according to Fulmer. 
“They didn’t provide us housing that night, they told us we had to find somebody’s couch to live on,” Fulmer said.
RAs do not have information about procedures for emergency housing in cases of immediate evacuation like Fulmer’s, according to Gasman.
“RAs are definitely kept in the dark about emergency housing,” Gasman said. “I don’t know if that’s on Res. Living or facilities or who is in charge of it. But I definitely think RAs have no idea what’s going on with emergency housing.”
Olson did not answer questions on whether Residential Living maintained spaces for emergency housing or if the Alumni Square relocation would reduce the availability of emergency housing. 
Instead, Olson referenced the medical housing process of the Academic Resource Center, which relocates students for general safety and health concerns.
“In any case where students would have to be relocated due to safety or health concerns, we would take action to make housing accommodations while minimizing disruption as much as possible,” Olson wrote. 
After their evacuation, Fulmer and his roommates stayed for two nights at the Key Bridge Marriott Hotel in Rosslyn, Va., before the university placed them in a Village A apartment.
Soon after Fulmer and his roommates moved in, however, the former residents of their new apartment warned them about the living space’s pre-existing hazards.
“The people previously living there knocked on our door and told us they had to be moved out because of horrific mold problems,” Fulmer said.
Fulmer and his roommates called facilities to measure the humidity in the apartment and ensure the mold had been dealt with, but Fulmer heard that the humidity standard used by facilities might not comply with an advisory from the Centers for Disease Control.
“With the girls who lived in that Vil. A before us, they came in and tested the humidity and said that that level was fine, but it was above what the CDC says is safe,” Fulmer said. “Why are they saying it’s okay if the CDC says it’s not?”
The CDC website states that indoor humidity levels should not exceed 50 percent. In an Oct. 18 op-ed in The Hoya, Luke Duffner (SFS ’20) wrote that facilities workers had approved of the relative humidity level in his apartment when it registered at 57 percent. After mold reports more than doubled last fall, at least one student contracted bronchitis from exposure to black mold in her dorm, leading to two emergency room trips. 
Kuo did not directly respond when asked what standards facilities workers or hired contractors use to gauge the threat posed by mold, but instead described the process completed by Eastern Research Group, a contractor hired last fall to assist with Georgetown’s mold problem.
“They conducted visual inspections and measured air conditions in buildings with high reports of moisture and mold,” Kuo wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In areas where apparent mold growth or other issues were identified, Facilities Management was notified and the required cleaning was completed promptly.”
Nancy Cave, a parent of a Georgetown freshman, sent an email about air quality concerns in her son’s dorm to Gregory Simmons, associate vice president of facilities operations, on Jan. 2. Nine days later, she received a reply from Simmons promising to review the situation. Cave followed up in three more emails over the next four weeks, but received no reply until a phone call from Simmons on Feb. 12.
During that phone call, Simmons apologized for the late response and said cleaning efforts and air quality tests had been completed in her son’s dorm. When Cave asked for test reports from her son’s dorm, Simmons said those reports were not public, according to Cave.
“He tried to assure me that my son’s room is safe,” Cave wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I asked for the air report and he said it was not his call to release it to me or make it public and that there was a committee above him that made the call not to release the reports.”
Simmons did not comment on which committee bans the publication of air quality reports or the reason why reports are not public.
“After any tests are performed, the university thoroughly reviews the findings and takes appropriate actions to maintain the safety and well-being of community members,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.  
Unreliable Communication
After Fulmer and his roommates were relocated to their Village A apartment, they had multiple conversations with Olson and Chatas, including a dinner with Chatas at The Tombs, according to Fulmer.
Through those conversations, Fulmer and his roommates learned that an official from facilities had noticed water damage on Alumni Square rooftops several weeks before their apartment was inspected in September, but had failed to take any action. 
“My roommates and I were informed that an official from Georgetown Facilities had seen the water damage weeks before on the roof and did not act on that observation,” Fulmer wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It was heavily implied in a later conversation with university officials that whoever was responsible for that was actually no longer with Georgetown. However, it is unclear whether Georgetown actually followed through on that, as the official is still listed on their website.”
The university did not comment on Fulmer’s statement and declined to name the university official mentioned by Fulmer. Student conversations with senior administrators to discuss concerns are not uncommon, according to a university spokesperson.
“Senior leaders from across the university meet with students to gather feedback and discuss how to enhance their experiences at Georgetown,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
While the university claims to communicate with students, Selcukbiricik, an international student, felt unprepared to grapple with the challenges of campus housing.
“I had no idea about what I was expecting, I just toured the campus once during the pre-orientation,” Selcukbiricik said. “I wish I had known I was going to sleep with rats for the next two years.”

In November 2018, the valve in the upstairs toilet of Vil A G104 broke, leaking a significant amount of water through the upstairs floor to the downstairs ceiling.  
My roommates and I were not told to evacuate, but voluntarily chose to stay over at our friends’ houses, so we did not have to sleep with soaked carpers and industrial-sized fans in our apartment.  
When we had returned the following morning, the ceiling of our ground floor had collapsed, with debris and a large metal rod on the floor.  Surely, had we been downstairs and had the ceiling fall quickly, we would have been injured.  Unlike the residents in the article, we were not even warned of the likelihood of a ceiling collapse.  
The open ceiling exposed a combination of black and brown and yellow insulation, yellow showing new and dry insulation and the black showing moldy insulation.
Thankfully at this point, we were given housing in the hotel.  However, the lack of warning about the risk of our ceiling collapsing, the black moldy insulation that could not have grown so moldy overnight, and the fact that we later found out that this apartment had a history (at least a year) of leaks and water issues, is highly concerning.

A special election will not be held for the vacant seat of Sam Appel (COL ’20) in the Georgetown University Student Association senate, in a departure from the GUSA constitution.
The GUSA president must call and hold an election for a vacant senate seat within 30 days of a senator’s exit, according to the GUSA constitution. The elected successor would occupy the seat for the rest of that legislative term. For GUSA’s constitution to be upheld, an election to fill Appel’s seat must take place by Feb. 28 following his Jan. 28 resignation. 
No special election is planned for Appel’s seat because of tight timing, according to GUSA election commission chair Minji Doh (SFS ’19). The elected senator would only serve a one- to two-week term before the general GUSA senate election, which is slated for mid-April, Doh said. 
“Because the election procedure itself takes 3-4 weeks to complete, and with the spring break, even if we start the process next week, the earliest the elected-senator would be in the office would be third week of March,” Doh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Because of the new election rules, it makes sense that we do not hold a special election at this time.”
GUSA reformed the senate elections in a February 2018 referendum after two failed referendums on the same issue took place two years prior. Under the new regulations, senators are elected based on class year rather than geographic location and elections for non-freshman senators will be held in April rather than in the fall.
The decision not to hold a special election was made by the GUSA election commission, according to outgoing GUSA President Juan Martinez (SFS ’20), who says the responsibility for special elections has shifted from the GUSA executive to the election commission over recent years.
“Although the Constitution gives the GUSA President the power to determine Election Commissioners and special elections, over time those responsibilities have more directly fallen under the purview of the Election Commission,” Martinez wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This has occurred under previous Executive administrations and Senate sessions.” 
In recent years the speaker of the senate has notified the executive and the election commission about any resignations, and the election commission has made subsequent arrangements pertaining to special elections, according to Martinez.
GUSA senate Speaker Eliza Lafferty (COL ’21), informed both the GUSA executive and election commission of Appel’s resignation at the time and deferred to the commission’s judgement on the matter.
A decision will not be designated as a violation to the constitution until an appeal is submitted and considered by the constitutional council, according to constitutional council chair William Morris (COL ’19). 
“Generally, some combination of the election commission/president decides what is pragmatically the best option,” Morris wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In theory, calling an election has the potential to raise just as many questions as not calling one. Their decision holds unless some party appeals to the Constitutional Council.”
GUSA senators differed on expectations around the vacant seat but confirmed they were not informed about the decision not to hold a special election.
GUSA Senator Harrison Nugent (SFS ’20) said he assumed the special election would not occur because of the close timeline with upcoming senate elections.
“I think most of us assumed the seat would be filled during the usual Spring Senate election due to it being so close,” Nugent wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Conversely, because GUSA constitution specifies a special election in the case of a vacancy, GUSA Senator Winston Ardoin (SFS ’21) assumed that one would be called for Appel’s seat.
Appel resigned from both the senate and the executive race Jan. 28 for reasons that have remained private at the request of a third party. 
Typically, a special election for a vacant senate seat would be put on the same ballot as the executive election, according to Doh.
However, the timeline of the resignation, which happened in the middle of the executive election season, meant the special election could not be held during the executive campaigns, according to Martinez.
“As you know, former Senator Sam Appel’s resignation came about during the Executive campaign period,” Martinez wrote. “This caused complications given that a new election season would have begun during the Executive campaign period or immediately following the Executive election.”
In addition to Appel’s departure from the senate, GUSA has experienced several resignations in recent months. Former GUSA Vice President Naba Rahman (SFS ’19) and 10 other executive cabinet members resigned Sept. 11 as part of a push to force then-GUSA President Sahil Nair (SFS ’19) out of office. Nair resigned later that morning.
After Rahman and staff members tried to rescind their resignations, GUSA senators demanded the resignations go into effect following an emergency session of the senate that night. Rahman and the remaining cabinet members officially resigned Sept. 13. Former Senator Chad Gasman (COL ’20) also resigned after the executive resignations because of subsequent mental health duress, according to a Sept. 12 statement by Gasman.
Special elections are not atypical and have regularly taken place for senate seats, according to GUSA historian Henry Westerman (SFS ’21).
“There have been special elections almost every year for the past 10 years or so, implying that these events are quite common,” Westerman wrote in an email to The Hoya.

A five-year, $75 million maintenance plan to alleviate building maintenance issues — including those in student residences — was approved by the Georgetown board of directors Feb. 14.
A portion of the funds will be used to renovate all Alumni Square west tower buildings after multiple instances of mold were reported by Alumni Square residents. The board also approved repairs of all Alumni Square apartment roofs after safety concerns over their structural integrity caused 85 students residing on the top floor to be relocated Feb. 11. 
The new funds aim to improve student housing and ensure the university is addressing other general maintenance issues through the Department of Planning and Facilities Management, according to university spokesperson Matt Hill.
“The plan includes student residences but will strengthen Planning and Facilities Management’s overall ability to improve our campus infrastructure and enhance the experience of students, faculty, staff, and visitors,” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The board of directors, which is composed of 39 members selected by the university, approves of major policy changes and advises University President John J. DeGioia on university decisions. The board has previously passed a tuition increase that removes a mandatory Yates membership fee for undergraduate students. 
The funds are set to be allocated to the university’s deferred maintenance budget, which includes projects that repair existing buildings instead of constructing new ones. These initiatives consist of roofing repair, resolution of structural defects, repair of utility and distribution systems and other costly projects that are not funded by Facilities’ operating budget.
Facilities problems originate in funding decisions made at higher levels of the administration, according to Jeremy Cohen (SFS ’20), a student who was relocated to the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center from his Alumni Square apartment.
“I would say that with regards to my experience with the Alumni Square move the problems with Georgetown facilities occur on the higher level in terms of funding allocation, rather than on Res Living or facilities,” Cohen wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “The problems with Georgetown facilities come from higher level decisions about what the priorities are and where money is spent.”
The university should urge donors to direct funds to immediate needs such as dorm repairs and facilities management rather than donating money for lofty new projects, according to Cohen.
“Ultimately I think some of the burden falls on alumni as well,” Cohen wrote. “Of course any large donor wants to earmark funds for a shiny new project, but ultimately what we need from them more than fancy programs or athletic facilities are funds specifically for bringing dorms up to a higher standard.”
Georgetown students have experienced other facilities and housing issues in the months leading up to the new maintenance plan approval. Facilities responded to 361 mold-related work requests between August and October last year, more than double the number reported during that time frame in 2017, and black mold in dorms has caused students to face upper-respiratory illnesses.
Oona Nash (COL ’22) told The Hoya that she contracted bronchitis as a result of black mold in her dorm room.
“I had a deep chest cough, and my bronchial tubes were congested, and my sinuses were clogged. I was constantly exhausted, and I got hives occasionally,” Nash said in a November interview with The Hoya. “I went to the emergency room twice. The doctors told me that my illness was being caused by black mold spores.”
Three student residences — Darnall Hall, Arrupe Hall, and Henle Village — experienced water outages Feb. 8, rendering students unable to flush toilets, shower or use water fountains overnight.
The first floor of Darnall Hall, a freshman residence, flooded last month, leading resident Phil Scholer (COL ’22) to sleep on his friends’ floor for two nights before being granted alternative housing.
While facilities workers were committed to cleaning the damage caused by the flood, Georgetown’s Office of Residential Living, which is tasked with housing assignments, remains disconnected from ongoing maintenance issues, according to Scholer. 
“Facilities did an outstanding job, staying here until 11 p.m. on Saturday to clean up. My disappointment is with housing,” Scholer wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The ground was soggy, the fans were loud, all our stuff was on the bed, and the air was heavy, but housing said the rooms were ready. Thankfully we got emergency housing after two nights. I wish housing was more in touch with the living conditions.” 
The board’s approval of the plan demonstrates the university’s commitment to addressing students’ housing issues, according to Hill.
“While Georgetown’s historic campus poses infrastructure challenges, the new deferred maintenance plan demonstrates the university’s commitment to improving our campus,” Hill wrote
The board also approved new campus improvement projects to be completed by fiscal year 2020, including the completion of renovations to Cooper Field’s facilities. The plan will also restore Kehoe Field by completing the installation of artificial turf on the roof of Yates Field House. Intramural and club sports teams that use Kehoe Field have been pushing the university to address structural issues that affect the field since 2014

Free speech and religious expression are under attack in today’s society and merit protection, Jeremy Tedesco, a senior counsel from Alliance Defending Freedom, said Thursday.
The government should never encroach upon citizens’ free speech, even if what they are saying is controversial or divisive, according to Tedesco.
“Dissenting and unpopular voices must be heard,” Tedesco said. “The best response to offensive or challenging speech, even speech that we might despise or hate, is more speech and engagement, never censorship.”
Free speech is a foundational American right, which must always be protected, according to Tedesco.
“America’s freedom is rooted in the principle that all people have inherent dignity and natural liberty, and free speech is essential to this proposition,” Tedesco said. “It secures the freedom of the mind and guarantees each citizen the right to fearlessly think, speak and grow.”
ADF has been labelled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit advocacy organization that specializes in civil rights litigation, because of its advocacy in support of limiting LGBTQ rights.
Calling religious organizations hate groups is merely a tool to censor political opponents, Tedesco said.
“I guess I’m outing myself here, but it’s, if anything, a badge of honor, the Southern Poverty Law Center says we’re a hate group,” Tedesco said. “If you want to talk about the kind of things that happen in culture that really undermine discourse and sow dissent and discord into our culture, it’s using those kinds of labels to weaponize your political disagreements.”
The event titled, “Masterpiece, National Institute of Family and Life Advocates & the Future of Free Speech,” was co-hosted by the Georgetown Lecture Fund, Georgetown University College Republicans, Georgetown Right to Life, anti-abortion student group, and The Free Speech Project, a project which aims to document cases of free speech violations. 
As an ADF litigator, Tedesco represented Masterpiece Cakeshop against the Colorado Civil Rights Commission in the Colorado Court of Appeals. 
The owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop, a bakery in Colorado, refused to create a wedding cake for a gay couple who visited the shop, saying that his religious convictions prevented him from supporting same-sex marriages. The case was eventually brought to the Supreme Court, which ruled in July 2018 in favor of Masterpiece Cakeshop, citing religious freedom protections.
This ruling was met by substantial backlash from the American public, which reflects a concerning trend of growing intolerance and animosity toward people of faith, according to Tedesco.
“Intolerance of those we disagree with is on a precipitous rise in our culture,” Tedesco said. “People of faith are being harassed or punished by the government, simply because they have a dissenting point of view about the prevailing orthodoxy in our culture.”
Jack Phillips, the owner of the bakery, filed suit against the state of Colorado over a second allegation of LGBTQ bias in December. The suit claims that Phillips was bombarded with vulgar and hateful comments over phone and by email following the Supreme Court decision, according to NBC News. Phillips also received numerous death threats directed at him and his family.
The ADF has a history with Georgetown. In 2018, the ADF provided legal counsel to Love Saxa, a student group that advocates for defining marriage as between a man and a woman, over alleged misappropriations of donations to other Georgetown clubs, including the LGBTQ resource center.
Tedesco has also dealt with cases concerning freedom of speech and expression, including a  Supreme Court case involving NIFLA, which provides pro bono legal counsel to anti-abortion pregnancy centers. The court decision overturned a previous California law that required anti-abortion pregnancy centers to display information pertaining to state-sponsored abortion services. The law was struck down as a violation of First Amendment free speech protections.
Tedesco hopes that Americans exercise more tolerance and respect toward people who hold different views, beliefs and backgrounds. 
“America’s diversity is among one of its greatest assets,” Tedesco said. “If we want that freedom, we need to also extend it to those who we disagree with, perhaps vehemently.”

A new Go Plastic-Free initiative will promote sustainable alternatives to single-use plastic products through a pledge for individual students, semesterly training sessions for the leaders of student organizations and a pledge for those organizations.
Launched by the Georgetown University Student Association sustainability policy team, the campaign aims to address global trends regarding reliance on single-use plastic, according to a Feb. 21 campus-wide GUSA email. The project is in collaboration with the Georgetown Office of Sustainability.
The campaign was motivated by low rates of global recycling — less than 20 percent of all plastic — and the fact that eight million metric tons of plastic enter the ocean each year, according to the email. The resolution on a plastic-free pledge for student organizations passed the GUSA senate Nov. 11 with a vote of 25-0.
The team designed the GPF campaign to focus on single-use plastics within their organizations, an aspect of sustainability that students can control, according to Samantha Panchèvre (SFS ’19), chair of the GUSA sustainability policy team. Panchèvre hopes that GUSA’s new campaign will bring environmental advocacy to the forefront of campus dialogue. 
“What I’m most excited about this policy is that it’s opening a huge door for a campus-wide discussion about how we can each do better to be environmentally conscious, while also holding the administration to be accountable,” Panchèvre wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The goal of the campaign is to not only reduce plastic use but also bring the issue of environmental consciousness to the university’s attention, according to Panchèvre.
“It’s not just about plastic; it’s about thinking more broadly about sustainability and showing the University that students care a lot about doing the right thing and that we want our school to make doing the right thing as easy as possible,” Panchèvre wrote.
GUSA and the Office of Sustainability are set to host three training sessions starting Feb. 24 for leaders from student organizations adopting the pledge to learn about green event planning and campus sustainability policies. 
To adopt the Go Plastic-Free Pledge as a student organization, at least one member is required to attend a training. The first 15 student organizations that register to attend a training will receive 15 free sets of reusable bamboo utensils for their members. 
The plastic-free push from the GUSA sustainability policy team comes on the heels of ongoing student activism surrounding environmental issues on campus. 
GU Fossil Free, a campus student group advocating for Georgetown University to adopt socially responsible investment policies, submitted a proposal Jan. 16 for Georgetown to divest from fossil fuel companies. 
Juliette Leader (SFS ’19), a member of GUFF, said that she is impressed by the initiative’s commitment to plastic-free goals (Full disclosure: Leader is a member of The Hoya’s editorial board). 
“Go Plastic Free Initiative is a great idea — it was actually in part spearheaded by a GUFFer — and provides a structured way for students and student organizations to reduce their plastic usage,” Leader wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As a member of other student organizations in the past, I’ve seen how much waste there can be at student events, and I applaud the Go Plastic Free Initiative for helping students take that step.” 
Tangible change around sustainability issues requires participation from the entire Georgetown community, according to Leader.
“I love that students are stepping up and taking action, but I do think actually fixing the sustainability issues requires commitment from students, faculty, staff, and the university,” Leader wrote. “For example, the university and Aramark need to work on reducing plastic usage in dining locations.”
The Georgetown Renewable Energy Environmental Network has been working with the university to promote composting and recycling initiatives in O’Donovan Hall and campus residence halls.
Lucy Chatfield (COL ’22), GREEN co-chair of recycling, said that GPF is an unprecedented and tangible initiative.
“Personally, I don’t think anything like GPF has been done before,” Chatfield wrote. “GPF is different; it’s a campaign that asks ALL Hoyas to commit to make this campus more sustainable by not only signing a pledge to reduce their waste but to also convince their organizations to make their events more sustainable, while drawing more attention to campus sustainability as a whole.”

Georgetown’s board of directors approved a campus weapons policy banning firearms on campus in a Feb. 14 meeting, with signage on the prohibition of weapons set to be posted on campus later this year.
The policy update — known as the Policy Prohibiting Firearms, Weapons and Explosives — clarifies that it is against university policy for students, faculty, employees or visitors to carry weapons of any kind on Georgetown’s campus, at university sponsored events or in vehicles owned by the university.
Though the Code of Student Conduct currently forbids the carrying of weapons, the university has never previously had a policy on firearms applicable to all individuals on campus. The federal court ruling prompted the university to reconsider the clarity of its own policies, according to Hill.
The Senate unanimously passed the weapons policy proposal Nov. 28 and reviewed it Jan. 17. The signage on these policies was approved by a Nov. 1 meeting of the Old Georgetown Board, a council of architects appointed by the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts that oversees design review of proposed projects within Washington, D.C. However, the signs regarding the weapons ban will not be posted until later this year, according to university spokesperson Matt Hill.
“We are posting signage in the coming weeks and months that reminds those entering campus about the provision of the law that prohibits firearms and weapons on private university property, including licensed concealed handguns,” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We’re finalizing the signage and will be posting them throughout campus later this year.”
The update comes in response to a July 2017 federal court decision that deemed unconstitutional a law limiting concealed carry permits. However, the D.C. Circuit Court upheld a provision of the law that prohibited firearms and weapons of any kind at colleges and universities.
“After the Federal Court ruling, Georgetown decided to clarify and consolidate its existing policies prohibiting firearms and weapons and codify it into one, university-wide policy,”  Hill wrote.
The policy update is part of Georgetown’s commitment to community safety, according to the policy.
“Georgetown University is committed to maintaining a safe learning and working environment for all members of the Georgetown Community,” the policy reads.
The policy will be overseen by the Georgetown University Police Department. Violators will be subject to penalties including the confiscation of weapons, suspension, barring from campus and university activities, dismissal and termination. They may also be referred to local law enforcement.
While the policy applies to everyone on campus, there are exemptions for law enforcement and other approved cases, according to a Feb. 14 university news release.
“The policy exempts authorized law enforcement and military personnel and allows Georgetown’s Chief of Police to provide exemptions for firearms and weapons that will be used for academic, artistic or cultural purposes, after being rendered inert and inoperable,” the news release reads.
Response to the university’s policy from anti-gun violence groups on campus has been positive. Chris Stauffer (SFS ’22), co-chair of Georgetown’s chapter of March For Our Lives, expressed support for the administration’s concern for student safety. 
“March for Our Lives supports the administration’s efforts to ban weapons on campus,” Stauffer wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This is a place of learning and we are glad to see the university take the necessary steps to make the campus safer for all.”

Workers rights student activists expressed grievances of low wages on behalf of Georgetown food service workers at a Feb 14. open forum about ongoing labor contract negotiations. 
Georgetown food service workers at O’Donovan Hall, Leavey Court and Einstein’s Bagels in Car Barn are represented by the Washington, D.C. branch of UNITE HERE!, a labor union that assists over 100,000 food service employees worldwide.
UNITE HERE! and Aramark reached a three-year employment contract deal in 2012, which was renegotiated and renewed in 2015 for another three years. The union had its first meeting with the Aramark to renegotiate a new labor contract after its expiration this past December.
The Georgetown Solidarity Committee, a student group committed to promoting workers’ rights, and La Casa Latina, which provides resources for Latinx students on campus, co-hosted an event titled, “Where’s the Love, Aramark?” Students spoke about the menial conditions faced by Georgetown food service employees. No Aramark workers were present at the event. 
La Casa Latina hosted the event to stand in solidarity with dining workers as many of Aramark’s food service workers are people of color, according to La Casa Latina Director Joseph Rodriguez.
“La Casa Latina supports the members of UNITE HERE! Local 23 as they bargain with Aramark,” Rodriguez wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We hope that the workers, many of whom are people of color that work long hours for low wages, can win a contract that accurately reflects the value and dignity of themselves and of their labor.”
Washington, D.C.’s living wage is approximately $37,000 a year, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Living Wage Calculator. On average, Aramark food service workers at Georgetown make around $23,000 a year, according to Glassdoor. 
With labor negotiations still ongoing, students must continue to show solidarity with Georgetown food service employees GSC member Gabriel Berger (COL ’21) said.
“Our general plan is to make sure that the facts are known, students are present, and that our voices our heard,” Berger said. “We know that in the past that has led to change, and we’re confident that it will lead to change this time too.”
Georgetown food service employees are also seeking out better employee benefits, according to GSC member Mariel Mendez (COL ’21).
“Another central thing is that they want their benefits to be continued and to be expanded,” Mendez said. “For their pension to be increased, their Medicare to be improved, their healthcare to be improved. Even simple things like getting parking”
Communication between student-run organizations and union employees often occurs within limited time slots and with limited opportunity for in-depth conversation, Berger said. There are likely plenty more issues that workers have yet to voice.
“It’s really hard to find a manager-free space to talk. And that’s important, because even as we grow more informed, we don’t know everything workers know,” Berger said. “It’s important to keep in mind that we don’t know the whole story here, we are just getting some of the basic facts.”
This is not the first time students have advocated for better working conditions for food workers at Georgetown. In January 2012, students and employees staged a demonstration in O’Donovan Hall for the negotiation of a more fair labor contract between Aramark and the UNITE HERE! union. After a year of prolonged talks, workers were able to secure benefits like pay increases, signing bonuses, and year-round health insurance for all hires. 
In 2015, 30 GSC members marched with 20 Aramark workers to Aramark leadership with a petition. Aramark management eventually agreed to workers’ demands, such as a 40-hour paid workweek, an agreements process to report managerial abuse or discrimination, and a cheaper healthcare insurance plan.
The current negotiations follow a tumultuous few years for Aramark, which recently came under fire with accusations of employee negligence and health violations throughout its service locations in North America, Asia, Europe and South America.
In 2010, Aramark paid $3.9 million to settle a class action lawsuit alleging that thousands of employees in California were not paid for all hours worked. Three years later, Aramark paid $2.75 million to settle a similar lawsuit involving unpaid wages. 
Students need to remember their advocacy is limited by their experiences, Berger said.
“Even as we grow informed, we don’t know everything workers know,” Berger said. “It’s important to keep in mind we don’t know the whole story here. We’re just getting basic facts.”

A bill that would force retailers throughout D.C. to abandon their no-cash policies is being considered by the D.C. Council as part of a renewed effort to ban Washington, D.C., businesses from denying cash payments. 
The Cashless Retailers Prohibition Act of 2019 was introduced Feb. 5 and classifies a retailer as any person holding a business license who “sells products or services in a retail setting in small quantities directly to the ultimate consumer.” 
Cashless policies discriminate against unbanked or underbanked consumers who are not served by banks or other financial institutions, according to the bill’s lead sponsor David Grosso (I-At Large). Forms of discrimination against cash payments include refusing payments in cash, posting signs that indicate cash is not an accepted form of payment or charging different prices to consumers using distinct payment methods, according to the bill. 
In D.C., 10.8 percent of all households were unbanked and 25. 4 percent were underbanked, according to a 2015 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation study. Black households were nearly 20 times more likely than white households to be unbanked, and three times more likely to be underbanked.
The practice disproportionately affects younger and low-income consumers, who are less likely to have credit cards or other means of payment besides cash, as well as customers who choose to use cash for accounting and safety purposes, according to Grosso.
“In addition to the disparate impact on low-income and young patrons, this practice affects other customers who may prefer to pay with cash to better manage their budget, or to avoid the very real risk of identity theft that comes along with credit card use,” Grosso said in a statement before the Council on Feb. 5. 
The bill’s goal is to foster greater financial inclusion in the District and protect vulnerable consumers, according to Grosso.
“Through this bill we can ensure that all D.C. residents and visitors can continue to patronize the businesses they choose, while avoiding the potential embarrassment of being denied service simply because they lack a credit card,” Grosso said.
Practices like discrimination against cash payments serve to divide the city, which should instead work towards fostering greater inclusion, Grosso said in a Feb. 5 news release. 
No-cash policies have become increasingly popular in the District, according to The Washington Post. Several prominent retailers throughout D.C., including Sweetgreen, Menchie’s and Bruery have adopted cashless models. Students of Georgetown, Inc., is also cashless. 
The change has increased profits for some retailers. In 2016, Sweetgreen reported that its locations reported anywhere between 5 and 15 percent more transactions per hour when they turned cashless. 
The Corp adopted a no-cash model in February 2018 to decrease costs and streamline operations, according to the organization’s Facebook page. Josh Sirois (SFS ’20), the chair of The Corp’s board of directors, was not available for comment at the time of press, but wrote in an email to The Hoya that he and the other board members were aware of the bill. 
Councilmember Grosso introduced a similar bill in June 2018 which also attempted to prohibit food retailers from discriminating against cash payments. The latest iteration of the bill expands the prohibition to cover all cashless retailers, not just food establishments. 
The 2018 bill did not pass certain legislative hurdles needed to be brought to a vote, according to Matthew Nocella, Councilmember Grosso’s communications director. 
Before the council can vote on any bill, it must be referred to a committee of jurisdiction. A vote never occurred because the Committee of the Whole, a committee which consists of all councilmembers and is chaired by Chairman Phil Mendelson, never held a hearing on the 2018 bill, Nocella wrote.
The bill’s late introduction to the Council delayed the legislative process, according to The Washington Post. 
Cash should be accepted as a form of currency in all campus stores to promote accessibility, incoming GUSA Vice President Aleida Olvera (COL ’20) wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
“It is important that we acknowledge cash in all stores on campus. It discriminates against students from a lower-socioeconomic status who often do not have the luxury of a bank account,” Olvera wrote.
This article was updated Feb. 24 to correct Sirois’ school and title.

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority is set to propose a $1 million program to subsidize Uber, Lyft and other ride-sharing services for late-night workers in the Washington, D.C., area by March. 
The subsidized trips, which would pay for a maximum of $3 per ride, would compensate for a lack of late-night Metro services, which ran between midnight and 3 a.m. Late-night services have been suspended since 2016 because of construction, according to The Washington Post. The program, which would fund rides within Metro’s area of operation between midnight and 4 a.m., would allow up to 10 weekly rides home per worker.
The proposal comes amid a push to re-institute the Metro’s late-night hours. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) issued a petition calling for a return of late-night services, which were set to be restored July 1. Bowser’s push for the restoration of late-night hours also comes during her Fair Shot February Initiative, which aims to make public transportation in the District more accessible.
However, the Metro board’s safety committee decided to keep the current operating hours, which close at midnight on weeknights, in a preliminary 3-1 committee vote Feb. 14. 
WMATA is still deciding whether to extend operational hours, Sherri Ly, media relations manager for WMATA, wrote in an email to The Hoya. Metro’s board of directors is expected to vote on the operating hours Feb. 28, according to Ly. 
Late-night Metro hours have not been instituted since 2016 because of the agency’s SafeTrack construction effort. SafeTrack is an accelerated rebuilding program that has allowed Metro to renovate its railways quickly and safely by increasing track time and extending maintenance hours into the transit agency’s late-night service hours. By combining maintenance time from weeknights, weekends and midday hours, the program finished three years’ worth of construction in one year.
SafeTrack was implemented after numerous safety lapses, including an accident at L’Enfant Plaza in 2015 which left commuters exposed to smoke for 45 minutes and resulted in the death of one rider and 91 other injuries, according to a June 2017 report by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Safety Center.
After SafeTrack ended in mid-2017, Metro officials have used the extra hours to implement preventative maintenance work. The new program started in July 2017 and included trackbed cleaning, stray current testing, cable testing to avoid smoke and fire accidents and verifying the correct rail alignment among other measures. By restoring late-night hours, the Metro will lose track time, hindering track maintenance and risking the safety of riders, according to Metro general manager Paul Wiedefeld.
“We need to do what it takes to keep the system, keep the people, keep our employees safe in operating our system,” Wiedefeld said at Bowser’s Jan. 29 breakfast with the D.C. Council. 
If Metro restores late-night service hours before ongoing construction is finished, the agency would face financial consequences. The Federal Transit Administration, which gives financial and technical support to local public transportation systems, warned the Metro board that they would withhold $1.6 billion in transit funding from the D.C. area if the late hours are reinstituted. 
The federal funding from the FTA relies on approval from the Metrorail Safety Commission, the oversight group for the process, which must be federally certified by April 15, according to The Washington Post. Returning to the late-night hours would complicate that process because the FTA would need to take additional time to review its budget allocations to ensure that they align with the agency’s safety needs under the new hours.  
Despite an improvement in track outages and on-time train performance, track fires still persist following the Metro’s maintenance program, according to Laura Mason, a manager of SafeTrack and other maintenance programs at Metro. 
“In the last 18 months, we’ve completed a significant amount of work in our system,” Mason said at Bowser’s breakfast.“However, our track fires, one of our most critical types of incidents we track, has only decreased by 20 percent, indicating there is still more work to be done.” 
Continuing the Metro closures harms the D.C. community, according to Bowser. 
“All of us have made a substantial commitment to making sure that Metro has what it needs,” Bowser said. “Metro needs to do a little bit more to make sure that this region has what it needs to stay open.”

A Black Lives Matter activist is awaiting a final judgment for her lawsuit against the Metropolitan Police Department to obtain documents to prove unlawful police surveillance after a Feb. 8 hearing.
April Goggans, a core organizer of Black Lives Matter D.C., first reported experiencing police surveillance in 2015, according to DCist. Goggans said she was followed over the course of several weeks, watched from outside of her home and stopped by MPD.
Goggans is seeking the release of documents relating to her surveillance through the Freedom of Information Act, a federal law allowing an individual to request access to government agency records. Goggans began submitting FOIA requests to MPD after these incidents, eventually filing a lawsuit in November 2017 when the requests were not met. 
MPD has declined to turn over documents that have to do with monitoring Goggans, asserting that Goggans’ speculation does not constitute a valid reason for their release. However, the department has confirmed it possesses 9,000 pages of documents containing Goggans’ address, Twitter handle and documents referring to two different spellings of Goggans’ last name, according to DCist.
D.C. Superior Court Judge William Jackson presided over the Feb. 8 summary judgment hearing, which was held to determine if MPD must provide Goggans with access to the documents. Jackson did not provide an immediate ruling on the lawsuit, with an additional hearing scheduled for April 5.
A representative from the MPD declined to comment on the issue, citing the MPD’s policy of not commenting on pending litigation.
New York Black Lives Matter activists also reported cases of unlawful police surveillance beginning in 2014 and claim the New York Police Department has been using social media software and undercover officers to monitor members of the group, according to The New York Times.
During Black Lives Matter protests after the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, two unarmed black men who were both killed by police officers in 2014, protesters reported their phones were losing reception and switching off, leading them to believe that police were using technology to intercept their communications.
The NYPD refused to confirm or deny whether the records requested by BLM activists existed. After a New York Supreme Court judge ruled that the NYPD had to disclose whether or not they interfered with protesters’ cell phones, NYPD responded that it did not disrupt constitutionally protected activities and would review the decision before moving forward.
Washington, D.C. citizens should encourage their councilmembers and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) to compel the MPD to be more transparent about police surveillance, Natacia Knapper, police accountability organizer of D.C.’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The ACLU has previously worked in conjunction with Black Lives Matter on an information request toward the MPD alongside the Stop Police Terror Project DC, an organization that seeks to combat racialized and militarized policing tactics according to their mission statement. To obtain information, the three organizations requested documents through the Freedom of Information Act. 
Activists need to continue to fight for protections for free speech in order to allow for marginalized voices to be heard, Knapper wrote. 
“We’re gratified that robust activism, led by groups like Black Lives Matter, continues today, and we’ll continue to work with them and other groups through our own advocacy and litigation to ensure government actions against free speech remain checked,” Knapper wrote in an email to The Hoya. “For our democracy to thrive, we need to hear all voices, not just the voice of the powerful.” 
Modern technology presents new problems for black activists to adapt to, Nile Blass (COL ’22), freshman representative for the Georgetown Black Student Alliance, said in an interview with The Hoya.
“It’s not necessarily a surprise so much as it is interesting to see distrust and suspicion of black and pro-black activism to be weaponized in modern ways,” Blass said. “It’s always been a danger to be black and opinionated so I hesitate to think whether this is an escalation of the danger that already exists for black activists or just a facet of it that has to be adapted to.”
Government surveillance of civil rights activists dates back through the 1950s when the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s surveillance of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights activists was conducted under the FBI Counterintelligence Program, COINTELPRO.
The Counterintelligence Program began in 1956 and was initially established to disrupt the activities of the Communist Party of the United States, according to the FBI’s website. By the 1960s, the program was expanded to include a number of other domestic groups including the Black Panther Party, the Socialist Workers Party and the Klu Klux Klan. The program was criticized by the U.S. Congress for abridging First Amendment rights and ended in 1971.
The suspicion of unlawful surveillance could act as a potential deterrent for activists, according to Knapper. 
“When activists see local or federal law enforcement conducting this type of surveillance, it chills First Amendment-protected speech,” Knapper wrote. “It makes those who would speak out hesitate, and makes them wonder: ‘Will I be targeted next?’”

A proposed biking and walking path that would pave over a former trolley line has divided residents of communities near the path’s entrances, many of whom object over the development of the area.
News of the path has been met with different reactions in the various communities possibly affected by the trail. Residents in the Foxhall Crescent neighborhood have voiced opposition to the plan over concerns that the improvements to the trail are unnecessary to satisfy the community’s demands. Residents have posted flyers along the trail saying “The trail is great in its natural state,” according to local news outlet Greater Greater Washington.
The proposal plans to transform the former trolley line into a 3-mile walking and biking path beginning at the intersection of Prospect and 37th streets and extending through the Foxhall Crescent neighborhood to end at Galena Place in the Palisades, according to Greater Greater Washington.
Washington, D.C.’s Department of Transportation plans to hold its first of two meetings on the planned trail March 7.
The Transportation Department has been working on the proposal for the last several months to determine the feasibility of the trail, the extent of work required to create and maintain the trail, and what to do with the trestle bridges that scatter the former trolley line. The proposal is set to be completed in August. However, a date has not yet been set to make an ultimate decision on the proposed trail.
The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal as well as the Capital Crescent Trail, which both run parallel to the proposed path, may affect its popularity, according to Elliot Colla, Director of Undergraduate Studies in the Department of Arabic and Islamic Studies at Georgetown and resident of the Palisades neighborhood. 
“I’m skeptical because I don’t know who would use the bike path to get anywhere, because it’s duplicating one that already exists in the capital crescent and this one joins up with the capital crescent in about a mile and a half,” Colla said. 
Residents of communities surrounding the entrance of the proposed trail that sits near Georgetown have not expressed significant opposition to Transportation Department’s proposal, according to Greater Greater Washington. The trail’s proponents have said that it will provide better accessibility between the the Palisades and Foxhall Crescent neighborhoods
The current trail contains gaps between various sections and overgrown brush along its edges. The trail itself, however, is mowed down to a short grass and maintains a relatively decent amount of traffic in its current state even without consistent maintenance from any government agency.
The Palisades Trolley Trail preliminary design project, which has also funded a feasibility study to identify issues in developing the Palisades Trolley Trail, costs roughly $600,000. Additional funding will be required if the proposal for the trail is approved, according to The Wash Cycle, an organization that promotes cycling in the D.C. area. If approved, the trail would likely gain funding from the “Move DC” initiative, a 25-year plan to modernize transportation throughout the District.
Debates over the proposed trail are raising questions about the use of the former trolley line that previously surfaced in May 2018 when local historical preservation advocates objected to the removal the old Foundry Branch streetcar bridge in the Glover Archbold Park area of the Palisades. Ultimately, the D.C. Board voted against allowing the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, who owns the bridge, to demolish it.
Alyssa Kasher (COL ’15), former captain of Club Triathlon, said the trail would present an exciting possibility for students.
“It would be pretty cool to have access to a trail that starts right on campus,” Kasher said.

Professors at Georgetown University are set to face an expedited application process for tenure following a Georgetown board of directors meeting Feb. 14.
The board approved a series of measures reforming the tenure process for professors and reorganizing academic programs within the university, granting a final seal of approval on these changes, some of which had been under development for years.
Under the new rules, a professor would receive tenure based on the approval of their executive vice president and 75 percent of the university’s Committee on Rank and Tenure. Previously, applications that received at least 75 percent of the vote would still require the university president’s approval.
The board’s decision expedites the previous appeal system under which tenure candidates vetoed by the university president would have to appeal for a formal overruling of the veto with 75 percent approval from the committee.
The tenure changes come from recommendations made by the Presidential Task Force to Examine Tenure and Promotion Policies and Processes, according to Lisa Krim, the senior advisor for faculty relations to University President John J. DeGioia.
“These changes are part of a broader effort to improve the rank and tenure processes at Georgetown,” Krim wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The Task Force’s hope is that the implementation of these recommendations will enhance confidence in the system at all levels.” 
The task force was assigned in May 2016 with finding ways to reform the university’s promotion practices to better support and attract professors. The final report, which was completed in September 2018, included recommendations that the tenure process should be more transparent and conform to the practices of other universities.
The other recommendations made by the presidential task force are being handled through other channels, according to Krim.
The reforms to the application process follow actions the university has taken to address inequalities between tenure and non-tenure-line professors, including granting full parental leave to non-tenure-line professors in November after student petitions.
In addition to restructuring the tenure application process, the board approved measures to reorganize multiple academic departments throughout the university.
The theology department is set to change its name to the department of theology and religious studies. The proposal was the result of a self-study by the department. Self-studies are conducted by every academic department at Georgetown about every 10 years.
The change was part of an effort to recognize the role of non-Christian religions in the department’s scholarship, according to current department chair William Werpehowski and Francisca Cho, who led the department at the time of the self-study.
“We recognized that a unique feature of our department–compared to many other Catholic universities–is that our faculty represents the field of religious studies as strongly as that of theology,” Cho wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Religious studies better reflects the department’s academic approach to religion, Cho wrote.
“Theology is primarily a Christian discipline that employs reason, constructive thinking, as well as criticism to hone Christian faith and community,” Cho wrote. “Religious studies is a much younger discipline that arose in the 19th century as a part of the general rise in modern scientific disciplines, as well as the European discovery of different religions around the world.”
The motion to change the name was first voted on by the department in 2017 before being approved by the Board of Directors this year. The department’s vote was 14 in favor, four against and two abstaining.
Georgetown now joins 12 out of 27 other Jesuit colleges and universities in recognizing both theology and religious studies as academic disciplines, according to the department’s proposal.
Werpehowski and Cho said the name change does not signal a drastic shift in the department’s academic philosophy, but is merely a reaffirmation of its longstanding practices.
“The name change doesn’t signal any major initiatives or changes in programming. Rather, it simply catches up with the reality that has long been in place,” Cho wrote. “Aside from being an accurate title, the inclusiveness of the new department name–which mirrors the inclusiveness of the department itself–embodies the particular capaciousness of the Jesuit heritage.”

Observe D.C. founder Ben Mindes (GRD ’19) testified that the Washington, D.C. Board of Elections effectively conducted the D.C. mayoral election in front of the D.C. Council on Feb. 19.
“Overall, voters experienced an efficient and well-organized election day,” Mindes said in his testimony. 
The testimony follows a 14-hour-long observation of the Nov. 6 election day by Observe D.C., a nonpartisan election observation initiative, in which 83 trained volunteers collected data from a random sampling of polling places to ensure the integrity of local elections. Volunteers observed that most polling stations contained the proper voting equipment, opened by 7:10 a.m., were designed to allow voters to cast their ballots in secret and had disability-accessible entrances, according to the testimony.
Despite these promising signs, the election observation still revealed some issues, Mindes said.
“There’s certainly room for improvement in D.C., and what we found is that there’s certain areas with administrative and procedural issues that can be changed in D.C.,” Mindes said in an interview with The Hoya. 
According to Mindes’ testimony, zero tape, a machine-created printout verifying that no one had voted before 7 a.m., was not posted by the time the polls opened in 28.9 percent of polling places, and 19.5 percent of polling places did not immediately make results public after the polls closed. 
Mindes also testified that 52.4 percent of polling places had voters in line by the time of the polls’ official closing at 8 p.m. and 18 percent of polling places experienced technical difficulties with the voting machines. Mindes notes, however, that all who wished to were still able to vote and that technical issues were usually quickly resolved by the D.C. Board of Elections.
These data were collected by the volunteers, who were stationed at the polling stations from before they opened at 7 a.m. until the last voters had cast their ballots. Findings were reported to Observe D.C.’s call center throughout the day.
Observe D.C.’s assessment marks the first sample-based observation of an election in U.S. history. Sample-based observation has been used by civic groups worldwide to assess and monitor election day practices and to ensure elections are carried out according to proper rules of compliance.
“The data that comes from a sample-based observation is the only independent and statistically valid data about what happens on election day,” Mindes said. 
The diversity of voting procedures within the thousands of voting jurisdictions means that sample-based election observations in the United States must remain hyper-localized. However, observations remain an important tool for identifying and solving problems unique to certain jurisdictions, such as the ones identified in the D.C. mayoral election, according to Mindes.
Sample-based observations could be a useful tool for improving the electoral processes in other jurisdictions, according to Mindes. Observe D.C. is compiling a comprehensive final report to share with the D.C. Board of Elections, D.C. voters and candidates.
“We think that there are places in the United States that could certainly use an injection of public confidence in their election administration, certainly after the 2018 election, and we’re hoping to bring sample-based observation methodology to those places,” Mindes said. 
The results of a Nov. 15 poll by the Pew Research Center revealed that 53 percent of Americans believe elections in their communities were run very well. Confidence in national elections was lower, with 21 percent of Americans responding that elections were run very well.
Mindes worked for the past two years as program officer on the elections and political processes team at the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, which he credits as having a huge influence on his decision to found the intiavative.
Observe D.C. was funded by the Baker Center for Leadership and Governance, a Georgetown center that provides programming in leadership development, as a recipient of a $20,000 Baker Innovation Grant. The Baker Center team expressed a positive assessment of the Initiative’s work in an email to The Hoya.  
“Observe DC gave so many people across the city the opportunity to engage meaningfully in our local elections, and we look forward to seeing Ben expand his initiative to reach new communities in the coming years,” they wrote.

A $20 million donation to Georgetown University will create a new fund to support opportunities for hands-on learning experiences both on and off campus. 
The gift, from Patricia Baker (COL ’64) and John Baker (COL ’64), chairman and CEO of International Planning Group, will form the Baker Trust for Transformational Learning, according to an email sent to students from University President John J. DeGioia on Feb. 13.
 “Their leadership will enable us to provide learning opportunities that extend beyond the classroom, preparing our young people to successfully engage with the complex challenges of our world,” DeGioia wrote. 
The Baker Trust aims to expand opportunities for new approaches to education, including increasing financial support for off-campus credit-bearing internships. Increased diversity among the student body and the need to create affordable opportunities for access to those approaches are essential in the 21st century, according to Randall Bass, vice provost for education and future director of the Baker Trust.
“The Bakers believe that the world is changing faster than universities can respond. Graduates now need a broader range of abilities to be effective in the world than ever before,” Bass wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The Bakers are passionate about wanting Georgetown to be in the forefront of preparing students for a changing and complex world.”
One proposal involves greater access to experiential learning that seeks to connects theory and practice. These types of experiences can range traditional workplace engagements to participation in community programs.
“Georgetown students have all kinds of opportunities like these now but they are unevenly (and inequitably) distributed, and typically marginal to the academic experience,” Bass wrote. “They are also increasingly expensive to provide, disconnected as they typically are from each other and from the core academic enterprise.”
A previous fund, such as the Policy Innovation Lab and experiential study abroad programs.
The Center also includes the Baker Scholars Program, an undergraduate development program for business leadership that selects sophomore students with a strong academic record, interest in business and dedication to service. The program includes mentorship opportunities, retreats, business trips and group projects.
The Trust is to be divided into three separate initiatives: the Collaborative for Experiential Learning, which will involve the connection of university experts from different schools and fields; the Baker Catalyst Fund, which focuses on high-impact educational programs in areas such as the core curriculum; and the Baker Programs, which add to preexisting university opportunities in areas such as experiential learning, according to Bass.
“These three elements are just a way to conceptualize the mechanisms, so to speak, by which to evolve opportunities over time,” Bass wrote. “What the Baker Trust achieves will be shaped through collaboration with scores of faculty, academic leaders, students and academic staff.”
The Capital Applied Learning Lab, an immersive internship program that will be housed within the Baker Programs, will begin in the fall of 2019. This program allows students to spend a semester living and interning downtown, while also meeting for classes and receiving academic credit, according to Matthew Pavesich, co-developer of curriculum for CALL. The CALL will also provide prefilled Metro cards as well as wage replacements for students who have to leave jobs in order to participate in the program. 
“These two examples might at first sound like fairly small-scale value-adds, but they’re precisely the kind of financial intervention that will prevent a lack of funds from keeping students from studying at the CALL,” Pavesich wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Georgetown’s location and identity are essential to the goals of the Baker Trust, John Baker said in a statement to the university.
“This all needs to happen at Georgetown: The Jesuit mission and D.C. location make it a perfect fit,” John Baker said. “If done right, it will be transformative globally.”
