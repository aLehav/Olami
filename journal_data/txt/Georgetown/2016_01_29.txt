When he was not inspiring meaningful conversation in his students, pursuing his passion for baking or empowering the disabled, Fr. Richard Curry, S.J., would give loud and friendly greetings to any passerby, stranger and friend alike.
“How are you, my friend?” he would exclaim, forcing all who passed him to crack a smile. His energy and compassion were contagious. Even after his passing, his compassion lives on in his deeds, relationships and achievements.
The Georgetown community celebrated Curry’s life Wednesday with a memorial Mass in Dahlgren Chapel. Curry, who passed away Dec. 19 from heart failure at the age of 72, was buried in Wernersville, Pa., at the Jesuit center where he was first ordained as a priest in 2009.
Raised in Philadelphia, Pa., Curry suffered from a birth defect and was born without a right forearm. In an attempt to boost his son’s confidence for a potential career in law, Curry’s father sent him to acting classes, inspiring Curry to pursue stagecraft.
Following his graduation from St. Joseph’s Preparatory, Curry joined the Jesuit Order as a brother in 1962 at age 19, though he would not become ordained until many decades later.
“The Jesuits really appreciated the intellect, they taught you how to think. This was something I didn’t have any barriers to,” Curry said in an interview with 60 Minutes in 2002.
While pursuing a Ph.D. in theater arts at New York University in 1977, Curry attempted to make money on the side by acting in commercials. However, when he went to audition for a mouthwash commercial, Curry could not pass the receptionist because of his disability.
“She burst out laughing hysterically,” Curry said in the 60 Minutes interview. “She turned, just like that, and said ‘Oh, I can’t send you upstairs. No, forget it.’”
Though his disability resulted in an unsuccessful audition, Curry was inspired by the ordeal to found the National Theater Workshop of the Handicapped in 1977, an institute dedicated to training those with disabilities in the art of theater and performance.
With campuses in both New York and Maine, the institute has allowed numerous individuals to participate in theater and practice their acting professionally. Curry himself continued to perform, even portraying a psychiatrist in one episode of the television detective series “Monk” in 2006.
Serving Veterans and Serving Bread
Twenty-seven years after founding the NTWH, Curry began the Writers’ Program for Wounded Soldiers in 2003, an initiative dedicated to helping disabled soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with emotional rehabilitation.
Six years after the program’s inauguration, Curry came to Georgetown as a chaplain-in-residence. He organized community support to develop the Academy for Veterans, an organization designed to help disabled veterans rebuild their lives and respond to their emotional needs.
“Eloquentia perfecta, the perfection of eloquence, is the end result of Jesuit education,” Curry said in an interview with PBS in 2010. “The student can stand on his or her own two feet and defend what he or she believes. This is what I wanted to do for the disabled, who have been ignored for so long.
While involved with the Academy of Veterans, Curry was still a Jesuit brother, but this changed when a triple amputee requested him, seeking counsel and absolution.
“I explained that I was a brother and had never been called to be a priest,” Father Curry said in SJU Magazine of Saint Joseph’s University. “He asked, ‘What do you mean? Who has to call you?’ I said, ‘God, or the Christian community.’ He replied, ‘Well, then, I’m calling you. I want you to be a priest.’”
Curry required special dispensation from the Vatican in order to become a priest, due to preexisting rules mandating priests to have two hands to perform Mass, and during the fall of 2009, Curry was finally ordained as a Jesuit Father and priest at the age of 66.
As Curry continued his work within the Georgetown community, he began to search for a way to further help veterans and their spouses with employment and business experience.
Curry had already translated his passion for cooking and baking into two cookbooks, “The Secrets of Jesuit Soupmaking: A Year of our Soups” (2002) and “The Secrets of Jesuit Breadmaking” (1995).
Using his passion for cooking, along with a partnership with local entrepreneur Connie Milstein, he helped found Dog Tag Bakery in 2014 to teach veterans tangible business skills while also providing employment.
The bakery has a partnership with the Georgetown School of Continuing Studies to offer employees night courses in small-business administration and entrepreneurship.
Curry said in a 2014 article in The Hoya [“Bakery Prepares for Launch,” The Hoya, Nov. 14, 2014] that the bakery offers veterans the chance to pursue their dreams.
“Everyone should make the most of this opportunity. All of you veterans have great business ideas and you may find someone here with a similar idea and the means with which to make your dream come true,” Curry said.
Director of the Veterans Office at Georgetown LeNaya Hezel praised Curry for his efforts toward the veteran community.
“Through his work as a Jesuit, professor, actor and military ally, he made monumental positive impacts on so many lives, and I am confident that his spirit will go on through the lives he impacted,” she wrote in an email to The Hoya. “He will be thoroughly missed by the Veterans Office and the many military students he supported on campus, but never forgotten.”
Inspiring Friendship and Reflection
In addition to giving back to the veterans’ community at Georgetown, Curry taught the unique and immensely popular “Theater and the Catholic Imagination” class, notable for its final project, a ‘flash mob’ performance by students in the class around campus.
In previous years, students performed a tap dance in O’Donovan Hall and the Intercultural Center, in addition to an individual final monologue titled “What I believe in,” in which students performed a theatrical piece detailing their deepest passions and motivations.
“The important thing is that you can find God in all things. That’s a Jesuit principle. What you try to do is show how thing scan reflect the goodness of God,” Curry said in an article on The Hoya’s blog, 4E following the Leo’s ‘flash-mob.’ “Performance and tap-dancing can do that, too. It brought an amazing amount of joy to the students and to the audience.”
While students outside of the class recognized Fr. Curry’s teaching for his unique final projects, Curry’s students most fondly remember the class for the bonds they formed with classmates.
Derek Embry (MSB ’15), a friend and former student of Curry’s, recounts his uncanny ability to bring people together as one of Curry’s greatest attributes.
“He was able to deliver his material successfully and in a way that got everyone in the class to become really close friends,” Embry said. “I’m glad I learned everything that I did in the class but more important than that was that I was able to make a very good group of friends and share with them personal information about myself and my experiences in life and still maintain a relationship with the professor, who ended up being an important part of my life.”
“I think the most impactful moment with Father Curry was him telling us to memorize everyone in my class. I have never known all of the students in my class since I have been at Georgetown and I think that was the moment I knew he was an exceptional guy,” former student William Dean (MSB ’16) said.
While Curry experienced many health problems during his final years, he never let his physical ailments come in the way of inspiring passion in his students.
“When he became seriously ill a few years ago, I was asked to take over his class. … When I walked into the classroom and saw 87 devastated students, I realized I would never be able to replace this formidable man,” professor of Spanish and Portuguese and faculty advisor for the Georgetown Student Veterans Association Barbara Mujica said at Curry’s memorial service.
Fr. Curry’s former student Daniel Wright (MSB ’16) echoed Mujica’s praise.
“He would show up to class with every ounce of energy he had even though he was sick, and he gave it to us, and then … even when he wasn’t there for us we gave every ounce of energy that we had in that hour and 15 minutes to each other,” he said. “And now I think all of us have a family of bonds that we will never forget.”
Chris Yedibalian (COL ’13), who currently works as business manager of Dog Tag Bakery, recalled Curry sacrificing his own health to do what he loved.
“He loved his class so much that he refused to miss it. Barely able to walk this past semester, he showed up to class week after week in a wheelchair, oxygen cans at his body’s side, knowing full well this level of exertion would put him back in the hospital the next day,” Yedibalian said. “Yet he would repeat this routine week after week, class to hospital, class to hospital. It simply was not an option that he was ever not going to be there for his students.
Curry’s Legacy of Compassion
Through Curry’s passion, drive and genuine caring, he has inspired students and faculty alike to live out Jesuit ideals.
Wednesday’s memorial service featured remarks and prayers from Jesuits, including Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J and Fr. Joseph Lingan, S.J., as well as Mujica and former students Yedibilian and Will Wrotniak (SFS ’18).
In attendance were Curry’s family members, including his sister Sr. Denise Curry from Notre Dame de Namur University who gave a reading at the service, his cousin Jim Curry and many students from his fall semester class.
“Fr. Curry was a good friend and an exemplary Jesuit,” O’Brien said at the memorial. “He was able to reach all different kinds of people, and, above all, helped each person find their distinctive, God-given voice. His sense of humor was contagious, and his love for God and his vocation as a Jesuit was clear to anyone who knew him.”
In his remarks, Lingan reminded attendees to acknowledge the purpose behind the gathering and look to Curry’s life as one to be celebrated.
“We gather to remember and celebrate a remarkable man of compassion and ideals, a man of courage and intelligence, a man of depth and generosity, a man of faith and a man of humor,” Lingnan said. “We gather to remind ourselves of this truth: That love endures, even after death.”
Curry inspired many through living by example in genuine caring for all people. Embry said that the greatest lesson he learned from Curry was to value the experiences and stories of all people, regardless of ability, age or creed.
“He taught me that every single person on earth, whether you realize it or not, has some sort of very magnificent and complicated story that if you give them a chance to tell, will blow you away,” Embry said.
Fr. Patrick Rogers, S.J., said that Curry’s unyielding passion for life continues to inspire him.
“His enthusiasm for life was something that always stuck with me no matter when I saw him; even from his hospital bed I would walk in and he’d say ‘Hey Patrick, how are you doing?’ or ‘Hey handsome how are ya it’s good to see you,’” Rogers said. “He connects to people in ways that they haven’t and that teaches you to — no matter how you feel and what your perspective is — to find the good in others.”
Yedibilian emphasized that Curry personified the Jesuit ideal of caring for others.
“If there is one single recurring sentiment I’ve heard from friends and families from different stages of his life, it’s gratitude for how singularly impactful this man was to each of them,” Yedibilian said. “He had a heart of gold and truly gave himself to everyone around him. He was a man for others.”

The Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service hosted a simulation of the upcoming Feb. 1 Iowa caucus that culminated with victories for Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the Copley Formal Lounge on Wednesday.
The event, titled the “Iowa Mockus,” featured former Associated Press White House Correspondent Nedra Pickler moderating the discourse between IPPS fellow Patrick Dillon, the former Deputy Political Director for President Barack Obama, and Sara Fagen, the former White House Political Director for President George W. Bush.
The event began with opening remarks from IPPS Executive Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94) and Will Simons (COL ’16), a member of Dillon’s student strategy team. Fagen then opened by defending Iowa — a small agrarian state whose population is over 90 percent white — as the locale for one of the most pivotal events of the general election.
“As an Iowan, I am quite proud of the Iowa caucus and I think there is a robust defense of why Iowa goes first and why it should continue to go first,” Fagen said. “In Iowa, it is not unusual for candidates to do events that are with 10 to 15 people, which is unheard of in presidential politics, and sometimes gaffes occur and you really get the sense of how someone’s mettle is tested.”
The speakers then outlined the different structures of the primary elections for each party. Dillon described the chaos that occurs on the Democratic side due to the party’s minimum viability threshold of 15 percent. The threshold is the minimum number of caucus attendees required for a candidate to be registered as viable and to advance to the next convention. Depending on which candidates are able to meet the threshold, attendees realign themselves in support.
“This is the principle of the caucus: If we’re going to reward you with delegates and advance you to the next stage on the Democratic side, you can’t just show up. You need at least some of level of organizing to make sure you have a real presence in the room,”
Dillon said. “So hypothetically, if candidates A and B have enough people, and you’ve got a candidate C who doesn’t, there is a phase called realignment, which is essentially taking all the people who are not viable and throwing them to the wolves.”
According to Fagen, the process for selecting a Republican winner is less dramatic.
“We’re a little neater and tidier on the Republican side,” Fagen said. “You can just show up and you have to sit through the process of the election of the chair, and listen to the candidate representatives speak on behalf of their favorites, but then you can vote and leave. Only the true die-hard activists tend to stay for the party business, the election of the delegates and the discussion for any recommendations for the county platform. We, effectively, have more of a preference poll.”
Pickler highlighted the Iowa caucus’ failure to select the Republican candidate who eventually snagged the party nomination in the last two election cycles, which saw Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum clinch victories in 2008 and 2012, respectively.
“New Hampshire goes second, although they like to call themselves first because they are the first primary, but they like to say that ‘Iowa picks corn and New Hampshire picks presidents,’” Pickler said.
Fagen and Dillon also shared their predictions for the upcoming caucus and the implications of each candidate’s win. Dillon said that contrary to prevailing pundit opinion, he believes Clinton will edge over Sanders despite his recent surge in polls.
“Hillary has not taken anything for granted in Iowa and has taken a sort of serious precinct caucus operation since day one, and that sort of does matter at the end of the day,” Dillon said. “The Sanders campaign is trying to bottle some of the same magic that the Obama campaign did in 2008, but I think the difference was that the Obama campaign had some of the best organizers in a generation and I’m not sure that is the case with the Sanders campaign.”
Fagen predicted Ted Cruz (R-T.X.) would defeat Donald Trump, citing her belief that Trump’s supporters will be less inclined to take on the commitment of attending the caucus.
“While Trump has enormous support and enormous energy around his campaign, many of his people are new,” Fagen said. “Keep in mind, in a caucus, you have to come out on a cold night in January, go to a place you may or may not be familiar with, sit around in a room with a bunch of people you may or may not know and be willing to listen to people talk about their respective candidates.”
In the latter half of the event, Democratic- and Republican-affiliated students participated in their own caucus, arguing on behalf of their candidates to sway undecided voters. Clinton’s campaign boasted a sweeping 89 vote percent victory over Sanders’ 11 percent. Among Republican voters, the vote was more brokered: Marco Rubio earned 30 percent, John Kasich 20 percent and Jeb Bush 15 percent. Dillon and Fagen led each side and conducted the voting.
President and founder of Hoyas for Hillary Amanda Shepherd (SFS ’18) spoke on behalf of Clinton while Georgetown for Rubio Campaign Manage Hunter Estes (SFS ’19) spoke on behalf of Rubio.
Shepherd emphasized her excitement at having the chance to convince undecided students to vote for Clinton.
“I wanted to show how passionate I am about her, while also making it clear that she is the most knowledgeable and most qualified,” Shepherd said. “When the time came to sway some of the undecideds, I listened to their particular concerns. Georgetown students are very knowledgeable on the issues, so the questions were very substantive and I welcomed the opportunity to address their concerns.”
D.C. Students for Rubio board member Zach Hughbanks (COL ’18) said that although he is confident about Rubio’s prospects as the GOP nominee, he is skeptical that the results at the actual Iowa caucus will resemble those of the Georgetown Mockus.
“Obviously, the rhetoric here is different, the vocabulary is different, and so they touched on things like college affordability which I don’t think would be the same in a town hall in Iowa,” Hughbanks said. “But a lot of the effectiveness you can tell was just better orators, people who were very prepared in their speech.”
Elleithee, who previously attended the Iowa caucus as Clinton’s spokesperson during her 2008 campaign, said that the degree of energy present at the Mockus was comparable to the actual event.
“I just loved the passion in this room tonight,” Elleithee said. “The Georgetown students came to play, they came to win, they were fired up and I think they learned something in the process. I think a lot of students were very hazy on the whole viability thing on the Democratic side or the differences in the caucus between the two parties, so everyone got something out of it.”
Correction: An earlier version of this article indicated that Fagen was the former Deputy White House Political Director. She was the Political Director.

Rubio is our JFK  and he’s a phenomenal  candidate  that the Republican Party hasn’t seen  in a long long time! Rubio is the only Republican candidate that can defeat Hillary Clinton in a general election! Rubio brings in the most Hispanics, Millennials and women voters to the Republican Party. If the Republican party elects another rich old white guy then our party will be done for decades! Just look at the demographics. And I can say that because I’m a white guy…

A recent D.C. Department of Human Services survey found that 43 percent of the District’s 330 homeless youths identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, according to D.C.’s first Homeless Youth Census released Jan. 13.
The youths surveyed were living on the streets, in a housing program or without a permanent home. Ninety percent of those surveyed were black, 5.5 percent were Hispanic, 3.4 percent were multiracial or identified as other and 1 percent was white.
The District announced that Verizon Wireless will donate $45,000 in grants to two nonprofit organizations, the Wanda Alston House and Supporting and Mentoring Youth Advocates and Leaders, which assist LGBTQ youths, and that the city will award five grants of around $5,000 to organizations with similar goals. D.C.’s annual budget for homeless youth programming has been increased by $1.3 million, bringing the funding to over $5 million.
According to Assistant Director of the Georgetown LGBTQ Resource Center Julian Haas, the census is reflective of what similar studies have shown in past years. Haas affirmed that a significant factor behind youth homelessness is family rejection.
“For many it may be safer to try to survive on their own than to stay at home,” Haas wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Some do not even have the option of staying at home and are forced to leave by their family. While the numbers vary state to state, we can also see that foster care systems disproportionately fail LGBTQ youth as compared to their heterosexual peers, often forcing youth to experience homelessness.”
Assistant professor of sociology Leslie R. Hinkson expressed her astonishment that this census marked the first survey for homeless youths in D.C.
“Nonprofit organizations have been created specifically to deal with this issue of homeless youth,” Hinkson said. “This is a problem that we have had in American society for a very long time and a problem that we definitely started admitting to by the 1970s, so it’s unbelievable to me that this is the first time there would be a census of homeless youth in the District.”
Hinkson mentioned that the 330 homeless youths surveyed by the census was a fraction of the actual number of homeless youths in the District.
“Looking at this definition of ‘homeless youth’ specifically, it’s important to note that there is a larger population of homeless youth in D.C.; it’s just that they are with their families in being homeless,” Hinkson said.
Carlo Izzo (COL ’17), a leader in the D.C. Hunger and Homelessness Alternative Spring Breaks Program, also emphasized the unique problems that homeless LGBTQ youths face.
“One of the main reasons why queer youth leave is one, that they don’t feel safe in their house or that two, people are uncomfortable being themselves,” Izzo said. “It’s a lot of different intersecting issues and you can’t just isolate queer youth. Specifically, queer people do get kicked out more often and that’s why services should reflect the fact.”
Haas explained that the LGBTQ youth population experiences many different forms of oppression and stressed that when examining this issue, it is also important to take into account other marginalized identities that the youths represent.
“Many of the youth in the census were also people of color,” Haas wrote. “LGBTQ youth of color face discrimination for their sexuality, gender expression and race. These intersecting forms of oppression magnify the negativity expressed towards LGBTQ youth represented in the census and are significant factors in why these youth end up experiencing homelessness.”
Hinkson said that the grants are a positive move, emphasizing that they must be used to gain a better understanding of demographics of the homeless youth population so that its needs can be met in the most efficient way possible.
“I think it’s a step in the right direction if the vast majority of those resources are going to be used as ways to figure out who these youth are and why we have them,” Hinkson said. “What’s the underlying cause of their homelessness? Is it poverty? Is it lack of education? Is it religion? I think there are a host of factors that you need to invest money into understanding.”
Hinkson pointed to the fact that grants and budget increases need to be put towards safety measures as well as funneled into assistance programs.
“These are individuals who don’t have places to live or sleep, who, because of their youth, are very, very vulnerable. There should also be money set aside for them to have assured places to live,” Hinkson said. “I don’t think that we should make assumptions that housing LGBT youths with other homeless youths would put them in danger, but I think that we do have to be very careful about ensuring their safety.”
Haas stressed the importance of the larger D.C. community recognizing homelessness as a major issue and sharing the responsibility of aiding those in need.
“I think it is easy for us to make the population of people experiencing homelessness seem invisible, or to pass judgment,” Haas wrote. “I would encourage your readers and all D.C. residents to make themselves familiar with the resources near them for people who are experiencing homelessness and do what they can to support those resources as we work together to make D.C. a safe place for all.”
Izzo said that he believes the funding will be used efficiently but that it will not solve the problems that cause homelessness in the LGBTQ community.
“They are definitely putting money in the right places. I think that the funding though, that’s just the beginning. We also have to start working in other ways,” Izzo said. “While money is great at getting attention, I think it’s also sustained effort to talk about queer youth, that being queer is okay as a child.”

When former University Registrar John Q. Pierce (CAS ’72) first came to Georgetown in 1968 as a “day hop,” or a commuting student, Healy Hall — now an administrative and academic building — was the center of student life. Campus served as refuge for Vietnam War protestors and course registration was a grueling process that involved computer punch cards in a sweltering McDonough Arena.
After 46 years at the university, during which time he has both witnessed and helped shape a changing Georgetown, Pierce announced in a campus-wide email Jan. 8 that he would retire from his position as registrar effective immediately and would retire from his position as assistant provost in June, transitioning into a part-time role. Dr. Walter Rankin has been appointed as interim registrar.
* * * * *
Pierce became acting registrar in November 1983, and was appointed Registrar in May 1984. In the early 2000s he was made assistant provost in addition to university registrar.
President John J. DeGioia’s Chief of Staff Joseph Ferrara emphasized Pierce’s significant contributions to the university in his variety of roles.
“For nearly five decades, John Pierce has enriched life at Georgetown — as a student and parent, a colleague and a university leader,” Ferrara wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The President’s Office is grateful for his dedication and the many ways he has contributed to our community.”
Pierce was also recently recognized with the Georgetown Alumni Admissions Program Board of Advisor’s Award for his long-standing contributions to the university.
Though he is retiring, Pierce said he hopes to stay on at Georgetown in a part-time capacity.
“The Provost just invited me to stay for another two years in a part-time job, no more than half time, but to continue to be involved in the planning and execution of academic ceremonies,” Pierce said.
His post-retirement plans also include taking care of his twin granddaughters, who will be entering kindergarten in the fall.
“They can come home and Grandma will try to make things be the way they’re supposed to be and Grandpa will spoil them,” Pierce said.
He would also like to audit a Latin class at Georgetown.
* * * * *
Pierce said when he was a student at Georgetown, student life was markedly different than it is today. Unsatisfied with the space in Riggs Library, students spilled over into other parts of Healy as the university grew. After the construction of Lauinger Library, students not only had a new study area, but a repurposed space to call their own in the Healy basement.
“After Lauinger opened, the students had a student center in the basement of Healy, and that was very successful,” Pierce said. “And then they opened Leavey and somehow Leavey didn’t provide the same kind of experience as Healy basement did. And so now I think we’ve come full circle with the opening of the Healey Family Center.”
Pierce attended Georgetown at a tumultuous time in both the university and nation’s history, as demonstrations in D.C. against the Vietnam War grew violent.
“We had National Guard Troops with their bayonets fixed on the Key Bridge and demonstrators starting fires on the streets of Georgetown,” Pierce said.
Pierce recounted how protestors sought refuge in Georgetown’s dorms as they fled law enforcement one Sunday night. At about 5 a.m. the next morning, law enforcement helicopters dropped tear gas on the dorms, affecting protestors, students and Jesuits alike. This was followed by news the National Guard would come on campus to remove demonstrators.
“[Then-Academic Vice President Fr. Kevin Fitzgerald, S.J.] got his Jesuit confreres to put on their Roman collars and they all went down to the main gate, and Father Fitzgerald said, ‘You may not come on my campus.’ And he stopped what would have been a horrible situation. So he’s always been my hero since then,” Pierce said.
After graduation, Pierce began work in the registrar’s office in November 1973, and was promoted to assistant registrar in June 1976. The raise that came with this promotion allowed him to propose to his then-girlfriend; now his wife of 40 years.
“I went from here to the apartment of my girlfriend of the time, Mary Fran Chalmers, with my letter of appointment from Father Kelly. And she said, ‘Oh, that’s nice.’ And I said, ‘So now that I have the money, will you marry me?’ And she said yes, forgetting to tell me I should get down on my knee,” Pierce said.
* * * * *
Much has changed in the Registrar’s office over the course of Pierce’s tenure. Before the automation of course registration, students registered in person in McDonough Arena. Registration consisted of a system involving computer punch cards corresponding to seats in a given class, which were then input into a computer along with a student’s ID number.
“Two-thirds of the way through the semester we would send out notes to the students saying, ‘this is what we think you’re registered for,’ and everyone would come back and say ‘no, this is what I’m supposed to be in,’” Pierce said.
The introduction of an online Degree Audit marked a major change in the process of student advising and registration.
“Before that you would just have a paper in the deans’ office to check off what you took but it was much easier to come to the end and you’d missed this requirement or that requirement,” Pierce said.
Pierce credits these advances for Georgetown’s steady four-year graduation rate. While Pierce initiated several changes in the registrar’s office, he still has a vision for the future of course registration.
“[I would like] to make the registration more of a decision support mechanism that is helping the student decide what to take, rather than a mechanism for recording what you’ve already decided on,” Pierce said.
He envisions a search engine that would allow students to discover classes in their topics of interest that also fulfill requirements. Looking forward, he also hopes there will be sufficient resources to continually upgrade the classrooms with technology to support faculty and students.
Although much has changed throughout the years, Pierce said Georgetown’s Jesuit heritage and ideals have been a constant throughout the decades.
“I would say that the essence of the place hasn’t changed. The size of the Jesuit community is much smaller, but their impact is, I think, the same or greater in many ways,” Pierce said. “I think that we’ve managed to maintain the traditions of the institution and the commitment to Jesuit education, and to education of the whole person, and to our engagement with the United States government, which was John Carroll’s vision.”
Bill Licamele (CAS ’68, MED ’72), one of Pierce’s friends and a member of the Georgetown University Board of Governors, said Pierce is a passionate member of the Georgetown community and a committed administrator.
“He’s one of the most enthusiastic Hoyas, not just on the academic side, but also on the emotional side and truly breathing blue and gray,” Licamele said. “He’s well respected by all the faculty and administrators for how efficiently he’s run the registrar’s office, and done that trying to modernize, trying to be fair to students.”
Catherine Summa (COL ’18) said Pierce had unique traits as an administrator.
“Georgetown will miss him,” Summa said. “From what I’ve seen, he has allowed Georgetown to grow by being truly receptive to the needs and voices of the students, which is a very special and rare thing to find in an administrator.”
Sarah Ciresi (COL ’18) said Pierce will be remembered for the manner in which he ran the registrar’s office and his community involvement.
“He has been such an integral part of the community, working with deans, faculty, and us students to ensure that things were always running smoothly. The whole Georgetown community will truly miss him,” Ciresi said.

Georgetown University offered students affected by the mailing of their W-2 forms to the incorrect addresses a free year of identity theft protection, according to an email sent to effected students by Associate Vice President for Benefits, Payroll & Wellness and Chief Benefits Officer Charles DeSantis yesterday.
The university has arranged for Experian to supply a year of their identity protection service to the affected students. Students who have already purchased identity protection can request to be reimbursed by the university.
The university accidentally sent student workers’ W-2 forms, which include sensitive personal information including Social Security Numbers, to incorrect addresses last week. According to DeSantis, the university has now sent W-2 forms to their correct address and they should arrive by today.
Gina Kim (SFS ’18) said while the move helps to address her most pressing concerns, she still wishes administrators handled the situation more diligently.
“It does kind of give me a peace of mind,” Kim said. “But I still think it was kind of confusing for my parents particularly when they received the wrong W-2 form — you never know who the form goes to, or where it went, if it went to another Hoya or not. So it is still kind of concerning, but I would say it’s a step in the right direction.”
She added that she wishes Payroll Services had contacted affected students individually.
“I think that they could have either reached out personally to any of the people who were affected so that those people could either make a time to talk about what happened or just get an understanding of it,” Kim said.

In the months leading up to the United States’ presidential primary elections, politically affiliated student groups on campus have increased activities to galvanize support for their respective candidates. These groups, which support candidates like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-V.T.) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-F.L.), have approached political activism by get-out-the-vote volunteering, fundraising and media interaction.
Hoyas for Hillary, a pro-Clinton group, has focused its efforts on a ground campaign both within and outside of the Georgetown community. Founded and led by Amanda Shepherd (SFS ’18), the group is officially affiliated with Clinton’s national campaign.
Led by former Hillary for Iowa intern Kevin Lo (COL ’16), several members of the group traveled to Iowa during winter break and volunteered for the “Get Out the Caucus” effort in support of Clinton’s campaign. Most of the group’s ground efforts during this period consisted of phone banking, knocking on doors and participating in campaign events.
Jack Dobkin (SFS ’19) traveled to Iowa and will also participate in Hoyas for Hillary’s upcoming trip to New Hampshire for Clinton’s get-out-the-vote effort.
“Something I think I’ve gained from these experiences is learning how to talk to people about the things I believe in,” Dobkin wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Most importantly, it’s just been a great experience getting to meet and talk to people that I probably never would have been able to otherwise.”
GU Students for Rubio, another student campaign activism group, chaired by Allie Williams (SFS ’19), is one of four student groups affiliated with the senator’s campaign in the Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia area. GUSFR has focused much of their efforts on local activism, which includes canvassing in the D.C. area, tabling on campus and recruiting additional members.
While the Georgetown chapter planned to rally for Rubio in New Hampshire, they were forced to cancel their trip because of insufficient funds from the national campaign. However, the cancellation has not affected the consistent efforts from the group.
“He’s the new face of the GOP,” Williams said. “He wants to do something for America that supports minorities and lower economic groups. He’s also just an amazing orator.”
Georgetown Students for Bernie focuses efforts both nationally and locally. The group actively works with outside media groups, making itself available for interviews and campaign events. During the fall, Al Jazeera America shot footage of the group tabling on campus as part of a story on Sanders.
The students have primarily engaged in phone banking on behalf of Sanders, targeting voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, reminding those individuals of voting dates and locations while advocating for Sanders. The students have also called voters in the DMV area, ensuring residents know how to register to vote.
Caleb Weaver (SFS ’16) — along with the two other co-founders of Georgetown for Bernie — is also working with GU College Democrats and Hoyas for Hillary to hold a mock Democratic debate.
Weaver said that he supports Sanders because of his boldness and unorthodoxy.
“He’s putting out Democratic policy that we want to see … and not saying to aim low, like a $15 minimum wage, universal access to higher education [and] getting big money out of politics,” Weaver said.
Unlike other campaign-affiliated student groups, Georgetown Students for Carly, which advocates for former Hewlett-Packard Company CEO Carly Fiorina, does not work with Fiorina’s official campaign, but with her super PAC, Carly for America.
Students from the D.C. area will travel to Iowa and New Hampshire in the coming weeks to volunteer for Fiorina’s campaign, mostly attending rallies and following Fiorina on campaign stops.
While no Georgetown students from the group will be participating in such upcoming trips, Georgetown Students for Carly has been active in different ways. The group recently provided a screening of “Carly Fiorina the Movie,” which was created by her super PAC in order to solicit support.
Alexander Bobroske (SFS ’17), a chairman for Students for Carly in the D.C. area, said that he admires Fiorina for her ability to pull people together and for her knowledge in global affairs.
“I think she is the best candidate to pull all factions of the Republican Party together. … She also is the most experienced in foreign policy,” Bobroske said.
Despite these groups’ efforts to impact students, many students have said that they are uninfluenced by their activities. Jack Pelose (COL ’19) said that he has learned more about prospective presidential nominees from his own independent research and faculty members than from student groups.
“I have learned a lot about politics from professors and other adults at Georgetown, such as the [Institute of Politics and Public Service] of fellows,” Pelose said. “While I admit I enjoy talking politics with friends at Georgetown, most of my political knowledge has come from listening to adults via speeches, internet articles and lectures.”
Emma Pettinga (COL ’17) is not involved with any of the groups advocating for candidates and has not experienced any candidate-specific political discussions during her classes. Instead, she said that she prefers to receive information about candidates from print and digital news media.
“I am a government major, [but] mostly I just read The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Politico,” Pettinga said. “Not in the courses I am taking has [current events] been something [professors have] discussed.”
Paola Peraza (SFS ’17) also said that the political activism groups on campus have not influenced her. In addition to reading digital news outlets, she has formed many of her political opinions during informal conversations with friends.
“I think, in general, Georgetown culture tends to be on the more liberal side, which has influenced my thoughts, but that’s more just part of an informal setting during talks with friends,” Peraza said.

Facing concerns over Washington’s past unpreparedness for its presidential primary, the D.C. Board of Elections has assured that the District is ready for this June’s primary.
The worries are due in part to past elections impaired by faulty voting machines, insufficient polling staff, inaccessible polling stations and delays in counting votes, according to The Washington Post.
The primary will mark D.C.’s first major electoral event since the 2014 mayoral elections when issues regarding the voting system in the District were brought to light, particularly the process of acquiring new voting machines.
In an effort to improve the voting process, the board will lease voting machines to replace old ones and use a new electronic pollbook system to allow for an expedited voting process. The ePollBook software uses electronic registration for voters and aims to increase the efficiency of voter check-in and verification.
Board of Elections spokeswoman Margarita Mikhaylova highlighted the board’s reluctance to implement a complete overhaul of the voting machine system, citing the lack of approved testing for newer systems.
“Although new machines have become available on the market, it is unknown … [which] ones will be certified under the new anticipated standards,” Mikhaylova wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Thus, the Board has felt it unwise at this time to purchase outright an entirely new system that has not yet been tested and approved under the new standards.”
In addition, Mikhaylova explained that the board plans to employ specifically trained “technical rovers,” software experts who will seek to resolve any difficulties that may occur on the day of the primary.
“DCBOE has deployed specifically trained personnel to assist with any technical questions or issues,” Mikhaylova wrote. “If a problem were to arise, the precinct captain can immediately contact a technical rover. … Response time should be extremely efficient.”
Doubts surrounding the board’s financial accountability in regards to purchasing new voting machines were pursued during a D.C. Council Judiciary hearing last month, during which Council Member Kenyan McDuffie (D-Ward 5) questioned acting Board Chairwoman Deborah Nichols, The Washington Post reported.
Board members have complained for years that they are unable purchase new voting machines because of inadequate funding when, in reality, the board was in possession of $4.9 million in federal funds – enough to purchase new voting machines.
Nichols defended her actions by explaining that she was unaware of how much money the board actually possessed.
“I thought we needed funding,” Nichols said during the Judiciary Committee hearing. “It wasn’t until six to eight months ago that I really found out the magnitude of what we had.”
According to The Washington Post, McDuffie asserted that the board is responsible for knowing what funding is available.
“You are the folks charged with administering the elections, and the issue you presented [in the past] was the equipment was outdated. Today you have the funding,” McDuffie said at the hearing. “Who was supposed to know the funding exists, if it’s not you all?”
Mikhaylova explained that the board had only recently undergone an audit of its finances at the time of the hearing.
“The District of Columbia, along with other jurisdictions, recently underwent an Election Assistance Commission Audit of its … funding,” Mikhaylova wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It wasn’t until a final report of the accounting was issued that Mrs. Nichols had an up-to-date amount of the funds.”
Member of activist group D.C. Watch Dorothy Brizill, who has monitored elections and attended board meetings for years, expressed concern with the board’s lack of transparency over its finances.
“If you look at the budgets that were submitted by the Board of Elections to the council, you will never ever see an indication that there was federal grant money available,” Brizill said to The Washington Post. “Now it turns out they were given money for new voting machines. . . . Why weren’t they ever acquired?”
The U.S. Election Assistance Commission, an independent body tasked with monitoring adherence to voting system guidelines, found that in September 2014 the board had $3 million in unspent federal funds. Another report on the EAC’s website explained that the board had $11 million in unspent funds. It is unclear why there is a disparity between these numbers.
In addition to the budget accounting issues, technical problems with voting machines occurred during the 2014 election. According to the D.C. Auditor’s Office, more than 64 percent of precinct machines it inspected during this time experienced various malfunctions.
According to The Washington Post, during the 2014 elections, over 40 percent of voting precincts were at least partially inaccessible for disabled voters. Mikhaylova said that the board is currently working with D.C. Public Schools and the Office of Disability Rights to provide accessible equipment and to deploy Americans with Disability Act compliance experts on election day.
“We cannot emphasize enough our goal to provide all voters … access to our voting program,” Mikhaylova wrote. “Our entire agency is committed to removing barriers to access at our polling sites.”
Despite these promised steps, the D.C. Council remains skeptical that these issues will be resolved. McDuffie is attempting to work with the D.C. Board of Elections to improve the District’s voting infrastructure, but it is unknown if the council will take any legislative action at this time to further the process.
“The folks charged with administering the elections [must work hard],” McDuffie said to The Washington Post. “I think the public’s confidence in the board’s ability to administer an election will depend on how the board administers the 2016 primary in general.”
Hoya Staff Writer Aly Pachter contributed reporting.
Correction: An earlier version of this article indicated that the D.C. Board of Elections plans to use a Scytl ePollBook system. The Board has not yet decided on which ePollBook system it will be using.

Quin Hillyer (CAS ’86), contributing editor for the National Review and senior editor for The American Spectator, criticized attacks on free speech at Georgetown and other college campuses and spoke about the true purpose of a university at a discussion in Maguire Hall Tuesday.
The event, titled “Free Speech at Georgetown,” was hosted by the College. Hillyer, who majored in government and theology while at Georgetown and served as an editor for The Hoya and a member of the College Republicans, has published articles in the Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, and has appeared on Fox News, CNN and MSNBC.
Hillyer said the ideas that underlie a university, such as free speech and enquiry, are under attack today. He noted that the danger of stifling free speech is present at universities nationwide and is one that must be resisted and defeated.
“Campuses across the nation are suffering attacks from groups of students, faculty, administrators, and outside agitators against the very idea of a university,” Hillyer said. “The assault is against free minds, free speech, free inquiry within the world of ideas, and thus, against the enterprise of higher learning itself.”
Hillyer emphasized that attacks on free speech occur at Georgetown as well. According to Hillyer, events like the protests against Christina Hoff Sommers — a scholar and lecturer who visited Georgetown last spring to speak about feminism — are particularly concerning.” A reaction in which student activists and the main campus paper argued that a respected, mainstream speaker should not even be allowed a forum because her views were hurtful, and in which, even worse, an official university office threatened to force the selective editing of a video of the event,” Hillyer said.
Hillyer said The Hoya’s editorial board’s coverage — which labeled the Hoff Sommer’s talk as harmful — is evidence of the dangers of the current campus climate.” If you don’t even understand the absurdity and Orwellian double speakery of The Hoya’s editorial, complaining of ‘obstructive dialogue’ and ‘harmful conversation,’ it’s tempting to already say you’re too far gone and there’s no hope for you,” Hillyer said. “On the other hand, if you have a mind good enough to be accepted into Georgetown, surely you have the capability of reassessing absurdity.”
Hillyer said trigger warnings should not be used, as students should be exposed to uncomfortable ideas while in college.
“And the very notion of a so-called, trigger warning, against supposedly hurtful speech is almost laughable, because it should be obvious that the university, more than any other place, is where students should come to be challenged, to be confronted with unfamiliar ideas, and even to be made somewhat uncomfortable by notions that may wrinkle, that may bring unwelcome emotions, and may, at first hearing, seem to offend,” Hillyer said.
Hillyer said the point of a college environment is to test ones intellectual beliefs in order to develop students’ characters and minds.
“Somebody daring to voice an unpopular opinion is the one who needs safety, not the one who finds the opinion disturbing,” Hillyer said. “Only by testing our own beliefs, risking exposure of our own biases, and leaving ourselves not just intellectually, but emotionally vulnerable, do we exercise our minds and develop our characters.”
Hillyer also discussed the recent occurrences at University of Massachusetts-Amherst, where a politically neutral debate club was unable to find a conservative professor on campus for an event. Instead, they had to seek out a professor from Smith College, to lead the conservative side of the event.
“A university is a special and abiding place because this is where ideas are free to wrestle with each other in honorable combat so that knowledge and reason can grow,” Hillyer said.President of the College Republicans Meghan Pohl (COL ’17) said the event was particularly relevant in light of the recent issues pertaining to free speech in universities lately.
“I found Mr. Hillyer’s argument to be well-founded as it pertained to the shutting down of expression from both the liberal and conservative sides,” Pohl said. “He summed it up best in his final response to a question when he addressed the growing polarization in Congress: the elimination of free speech and dialogue on college campuses today will only further impede bipartisan dialogue and productivity in the future.”
Erica Lizza (SFS ’19) said the event appealed to her interest in free speech, particularly in relation to the dynamic of college campuses.
“Coming to a college campus where everyone has an opinion about everything, which can be wonderful but also a little complicated, I thought it would be interesting to see what someone in the political arena would have to say about how we, as college students, tend to view free speech,” Lizza said.
[…] Georgetown Voice did a good job covering it. I just now see that The HOYA covered it too. Both were straightforward, just-the-facts, fair news stories, which I appreciate. I like seeing […]

The Georgetown University Student Association and StartupHoyas will implement a new weekly marketplace for the student body in the Leavey Center this spring. The market, which will serve as an indoor version of the Wednesday Farmer’s Market in the fall and spring months — named the Startup Market — will feature goods for sale from student entrepreneurs every Friday during the spring semester. While the initiative is still in its development phase, the effort to bring the Startup Market to the Leavey Center is designed to give Georgetown students the opportunity to sell original products through their independent small businesses. GUSA Secretary of Entrepreneurship Jake Maxmin (COL ’17) spearheaded the project on behalf of GUSA and is optimistic that the market will open in the spring semester.
Maxmin, who holds experience with independent small businesses as founder and CEO of Wearable Justice, said he sees the project as an opportunity for students like himself to run businesses on campus through different outlets other than The Corp and the Farmer’s Market. Such avenues were the only options available to Maxmin during his first years as a student business owner.
“Through my position I wanted to work more with the [Center for Student Engagement] to create a way where we can really validate student businesses, to give them something to say that ‘We at Georgetown University endorse you,’ and then create a space for them to be able to sell their product,” Maxmin said. “The idea came from brainstorming sessions with myself and StartupHoyas.”
Maxmin said the Startup Market strives to engage the student body in entrepreneurship and provide greater exposure to existing student businesses.
“We’re trying to gear the Startup Market to be a space where people who are also interested in entrepreneurship can come and speak to different businesses,” Maxmin said. “We’re creating more of a space and a gathering for not only buying and selling but also for learning more about what entrepreneurship looks like on campus and to talk to people who are involved in it.”
Founding director of the Georgetown Entrepreneurial Initiative and McDonough School of Business professor Jeff Reid praised the efforts made so far to establish the market while highlighting its importance to students interested in entrepreneurial endeavors.
“StartupHoyas is happy to support efforts like this one that help student entrepreneurs,” Reid wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The Division of Student Affairs, GUSA and Auxiliary Services are working hard to create the Startup Market. This is a good example of how many different campus organizations can come together to support students’ entrepreneurial interests.”
Student businesses that operate within reasonable cost and are not affiliated with Georgetown are eligible to apply for a spot within the Startup Market.
“We’re looking at whether all of your [businesses’] workers are Georgetown students,” Maxmin said. “We then ask questions like where are your sourcing your products from, what’s your average cost per product, what’s your mission statement, what do you hope to gain from this market in terms of educational experience. We make sure these businesses aren’t in any way promoting hate or exclusion.”
Associate Director of StartupHoyas Alyssa Lovegrove said the project’s value for the Georgetown community is aligned with StartupHoyas’ central mission to provide prospective student entrepreneurs with the resources and programs to inspire entrepreneurial initiatives.
“We want students to think ‘entrepreneurially’ about their own personal brand and their careers, to be proactive and to create opportunities for themselves, based on their life goals,” Lovegrove wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We believe that entrepreneurial problem-solving should be something that every Georgetown student understands and practices.”
In addition to establishing the Startup Market, StartupHoyas will also host startup career fairs, pitch competitions and chalk talks with their Entrepreneurs-in-Residence this semester. These interactive programs are designed to expand the culture of entrepreneurship and idea-sharing throughout the student body.
Sara Clark (COL ’19) said she supports the implementation of the Startup Market and sees it as a valuable outlet for entrepreneurial activity.
“I think there’s a lot of demand for student businesses to be able to sell their products and grow as a business while engaging with Georgetown students as customers. A marketplace exclusively featuring student ideas sounds like an interesting outlet for that,” Clark said.

Mayors Muriel Bowser of Washington, D.C., Mick Cornett of Oklahoma City, Okla., Sly James of Kansas City, Mo. and Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio discussed strategies to combat economic inequality, increase the quality of education and reduce violence in their cities at a panel discussion hosted by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service in Copley Formal Lounge Jan. 20.
Over 100 students and faculty attended the discussion, titled “Building Cities of Opportunity for All: Policy Solutions for Equitable Economic Development”, the first event featuring 2016 IPPS fellow Alvin Brown, the former mayor of Jacksonville, Fla. The panel coincided with the 2016 U.S. Conference of Mayors in Washington, D.C. and was moderated by Brown and Erin Mullally (GRD ‘16), editor in chief at the Georgetown Public Policy Review.
Executive Director of IPPS Mo Elleithee opened the event by emphasizing that the panel was formed as a result of McCourt School of Public Policy students’ desire to hear from U.S. mayors during the 2016 U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting.
Executive Director of the U.S. Conference of Mayors Tom Cochran, who coordinated the mayors for the event, and President of the Georgetown Public Policy Student Association Jessica Clarke (GRD ’16) introduced Bowser, Cornett, James and Whaley.
Cochran emphasized the important role that mayors play in local government in their ability to affect meaningful and lasting change in their communities.
“What’s so beautiful about the mayors is that you can work for a congressman, you can work for a governor, but when you’re working for a mayor you’re making changes in people’s lives and also creating beautiful cities [like we have in the United States],” Cochran said.
The four mayors responded to questions on how to address high crime rates, spur economic development and increase educational quality in their cities. Cornett, a Republican, said Oklahoma City has relied on philanthropic endeavors to solve his cities’ social issues.
“Our efforts to try and keep taxes low, but get the philanthropy and the strong economy to support the social organizations that can help us with a lot of these issue, is a model that’s worked for us,” Cornett said.
Bowser, a Democrat, said D.C. is in a unique position as a city outside of state-level jurisdiction, but faces challenges dealing with Congress.
“We can actually push innovation through our system and really call on and call out our federal government for not the things that are so important,” Bowser said.
Bowser outlined three priorities the city will implement to facilitate D.C.’s economic transformation, including a $100 million commitment to low income housing, expansion of summer youth employment programs to allow employment for individuals up to age 24 and a five-year plan to end homelessness.
Bowser also emphasized the District’s growing problem of income inequality as a barrier to future success.
“We’re in a place in our city where [fighting] income inequality is one of the major reasons why I ran for mayor and I believe I was elected. People love the prosperity that is happening in Washington, the renaissance is tremendous,” Bowser said.
“We want to make sure that the people who stuck around for the hard times are able to stick around for the good times.”
James, an Independent, said the problems of income inequality and crime are symptoms of three larger issues in the United States laid out by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: racism, poverty and militarism.
“Education, housing, poverty, all of those things are born of something, and we need to address those core illnesses before we can get rid of the symptoms,” James said.
Whaley, a Democrat, said the issues of income inequality and improving education can be solved by encouraging job growth in her city.
“Ninety-two percent of the economic impact comes from cities … we have a challenge in making sure that the jobs that are creating wealth are staying in our community,” Whaley said.
The mayors were then asked to explain the merits of working in local government compared to a job at the federal or state levels.
Whaley said the level of intimacy in public service is unmatched when compared to big government.
“If you’re interested in public service, you will not get that direct back and forth like you do on the ground in local government,” Whaley said. “We need smart, committed people in local government.”
Bowser said working in local government compared to state or federal government comes down to personal preferences.
“I think that each of you will have to decide what it is you like about serving,” Bowser said. “I like being on the executive side of local government as that is where you can make change … you get to make the decisions and you’re accountable for all of the decisions being made.”
The panel discussion was followed by a question-and-answer session with the audience. Mariam Ghavalyan (GRD ’17), a first year Master’s in Public Policy student at McCourt School of Public Policy, praised the four mayors for showing the devotion it takes to be a successful mayor.
“You hear a lot of different politicians, especially in Congress, they’re pessimistic and they’re cynical, but I think mayors are actually devoted to making real difference happen, and they sound very passionate about the things they talk about,” Ghavalyan said.
Chris Gray (GRD ’17), who also attended the event, said he was surprised by the similarity of solutions to problems such as income inequality across cities.
“It was interesting how similar a lot of the views are, since at the core of it, the individual politics don’t matter as much as taking care of the issues in the cities,” Gray said. “I think the argument that you can have a bigger effect in the local government is definitely valid.”
Ghavalyan said the mayors’ pitches for working in local government confirmed her desire to make a tangible impact on people’s lives.
“I think her pitch was really effective, and especially for someone like me, who is already interested in working in local government, it confirmed my desire to go back to Los Angeles where I am from and get involved in local politics,” Ghavalyan said. “I think that’s where real change happens.”

The District of Columbia Public School Global Education Program recently launched its first-ever study abroad initiative, set to begin in the summer of 2016.
Four hundred students and teachers will have the opportunity to spend eight to 19 days in one of 12 countries this June and July, free of charge to the participants. The trips, which focus on service, leadership and language immersion, are open to students in 8th or 11th grade enrolled in a world language course.  D.C. public schools offer at least one of these seven language courses: American Sign Language, Arabic, French, Italian, Latin, Mandarin Chinese and Spanish.
The study abroad program is funded by the D.C. Public Education Fund, a local nonprofit that covers transportation, housing and meals, as well as passport and visa fees for all participants. The comprehensive funding aims to make the program accessible to students from all backgrounds and varying financial means.
The Public Education Fund is contributing $2.78 million in total to fund DCPS Global Education Programs.
Portfolio Director for the Public Education Fund Katie Aiello-Howard said that the program is part of DCPS’s aim to provide the best possible learning experience for its students.
“Every DCPS student should be excited to come to school every day, and DCPS knows that a student who is motivated to learn is one who is also exposed to enriching educational experiences,” Aiello-Howard wrote in a press release published in January 2016. “By creating more rigorous world language programs through an increase in current content offerings, DCPS can better prepare students to be globally experienced graduates.”
DCPS hopes that the program will not only expose the students to foreign cultures but also improve their linguistic skills and prepare them for their future after graduation, be it in college or for a career.
DCPS Press Secretary Michelle Lerner highlighted the importance of educating students about the global community.
“DC Public Schools is committed to providing a world-class education to its students. The opportunity to better understand a more global world is an imperative part of that strategy,” Lerner wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We want every DCPS graduate to be an inquisitive, informed and active world citizen, prepared for an increasingly diverse international community.”
To be considered for the program, students must submit an application that includes short essay questions and a reference from a non-family member by Feb. 15. In addition to the language course prerequisite, students must demonstrate their commitment to the program’s various requirements.
Applicants in the 8th grade can apply to attend one of five trips offered to Costa Rica, Ecuador, Spain, China, France or Italy. The trips to China and Ecuador emphasize connecting culture to service, while the other three are primarily intended for the purpose of language immersion.
The 11th graders, on the other hand, can choose from 11 locations: Belgium, Chile, China, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, France, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Peru and Spain. Out of the 11 programs, five focus on language immersion, five are service learning-oriented and one is designed to foster global leadership.
Lerner stressed the importance of making the program available to students of all economic backgrounds in order to expose them to opportunities to travel internationally.
“Every student deserves a world of possibilities; that’s why DCPS developed a study abroad program,” Lerner wrote. “DCPS Study Abroad helps ensure that our global citizens have access to global experiences, so that travel becomes the expectation rather than the exception for students.”
Additionally, DCPS partnered with other organizations to offer cultural communication and general safety training to better prepare students for the experience of being abroad. These training sessions are led by “teacher ambassadors” appointed by the DCPS who will attend monthly meetings with the DCPS Global Education Program.
Lerner emphasized the preparation process as part of DCPS’s effort to cater to the whole student, highlighting how these trips may be the first international ones for some students.
“When we think about providing a rich education to every student, we think about the experiences, curriculum and tools our students need to be successful graduates of DC Public Schools, prepared for college or career,” Lerner wrote. “The chance to study abroad and see a part of the world fits into that frame.”
D.C. native Meghan Zorc (NHS ’19), who attended a private school, said that she wholly approves of this initiative as a means to expose students to new experiences.
“At my school, I did have an exchange program. When I was a sophomore in high school I got to experience learning in a different city before going to college and I think that’s a worthwhile experience,” Zorc said. “Hearing about the D.C. Public Schools’ initiative is remarkable, I think, because it gives kids the opportunity to travel that wouldn’t have the means to do it otherwise, and to experience these service opportunities before they’re exposed to it in high school.”
