Former white nationalist Derek Black, in his first public event since denouncing his formative community in 2013, argued against the belief that civil discourse alone can combat racism at Copley Formal Lounge last night.
Black, whose father is the founder of the white nationalist website Stormfront, and whose godfather is former Ku Klux Klan Imperial Wizard David Duke, was poised to be the heir to his father’s white nationalist organization before renouncing the movement in the summer of 2013 with a letter posted on the Southern Poverty Law Center website.
“White nationalism supports the premise that multiculturalism is a failure, and that politicians trapped in a multicultural status quo are oppressing white people in ‘their own country,” the letter reads. “I now consider this belief system principally flawed.”
In an exclusive interview with The Hoya following the event, Black said that it is imperative to examine all sides of foundational white nationalist claims.
“Context — I’m more and more convinced — is the largest thing. If you are willing to look at it, all this stuff falls apart,” Black said. “I’d confess, ‘That doesn’t work,’ so I’ll take that block out. And eventually, I didn’t have any blocks left.”
According to Black, the white nationalist community serves as an echo chamber for its own ideology.
“You have everything figured out and you just have to be sure that other people figure it out, too. They’re going to reject it, but you’re right,” Black said. “That makes it easier to go into the world. I mean, I knew everything.”
As a child, Black was a public face of the movement’s future, giving interviews to various media outlets including USA TODAY. Black said that although he grew up engaging with the media, he now perceives overexposure as a distraction from critical thinking.
“As a white nationalist, you can play the news really well,” Black said. “Just do something controversial, and you can get national news.”
Georgetown history professor Marcia Chatelain moderated the question-and-answer session hosted by the Georgetown University Lecture Fund and co-sponsored by The Hoya, Students of Color Alliance, Black Student Alliance and the Jewish Student Association.
Citing the national attention garnered by the annual D.C. conference of the self-described “alt-right” movement, Black said the impact of the white nationalist movement can be easily sensationalized. A video of an “alt-right” conference in Washington, D.C., went viral last November after some attendees were recorded performing Nazi salutes.
“If you weren’t paying attention, you could think this was something that was happening. It was irresponsible,” Black said during the event. “They were trying to be scandalous. They need to give context, rather than doing an ‘Ebola freak-out.’”
Despite the historic role violent action has played in the white nationalist movement and specifically in the KKK, Black said the movement he knew as a child centered on discourse.
“It made it easier for me when I was younger because there was never any violence around me. What I grew up with was going to conferences and hearing people talk about IQ differences between African countries and European countries,” Black said. “It was this pseudo-intellectual thing. I was aware that the news presented it as violent.  I viewed it as really civil discourse, and I didn’t know why people reacted so strongly to it.”
Black said that though he believes that civil discourse alone is not sufficient to combat racism, he was forced to engage in it following his departure from white nationalism because of his unique personal background.
“It’s not that civil discourse wins,” Black said. “That’s not the lesson here. It’s important to talk to people, but the only reason that happened was because it was the biggest uproar of my life. I had to engage with it.”
Black said the political climate during the recent presidential election influenced him to pen an op-ed in The New York Times published last December. In the piece, Black explained the reasons that led to his “flight from white nationalism.”
“Through many talks with devoted and diverse people there — people who chose to invite me into their dorms and conversations rather than ostracize me — I began to realize the damage I had done,” Black wrote in reference to his time at New College of Florida. “No checks and balances can redeem what we’ve unleashed.”
Black added that the political climate during the recent presidential election was the impetus for him to pen the op-ed.
“Maybe America is changing for the worse and they’re not saying racist things, but that’s the difference between white nationalism and political discourse — that they don’t say ‘white.’ You have these little tiny communities having their little tiny conferences, and they don’t have power yet, but their ideas are certainly center stage,” Black said.
Though Black has been removed from the movement in recent years and immersed in academia, he said his familial ties inevitably bind him to the community.
“I can definitely relate to people who went to college and learned some stuff and went back home and suddenly the things they hear make them cringe,” Black said. “I have to wonder whether what my loved ones are doing is damaging the nation more so than the fact that Thanksgiving is uncomfortable.”
Lecture Fund Chief of Staff Aiden Johnson (COL ’19), who organized the event, said that Black struck the appropriate balance between addressing the current political atmosphere and sharing a personal narrative.
“I always kind of religiously keep my personal eyes out saying, ‘what is a story that catches my eye that has a relevant conversation,’ and when I first saw this it hit both of those check marks,” Johnson said. “It was an opportune moment.”
Director of Protestant Chaplaincy Rev. Bryant Oskvig, who attended the event, said that discourse — civil or otherwise — is a key tenet of the university’s philosophy on contemplation.
“He was clear that it wasn’t always civil discourse, but it was discourse nonetheless. So this question of how we engage the engage of ideas becomes really important,” Oskvig said. “Here at Georgetown where we talk about becoming contemplatives in action, we don’t just take the values that we enter into at face value, we actually examine everything and allow those perspectives to be challenged and deepened in many cases through the engagement of ideas.”
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said that though Black shied away from the idea that all effective discourse must be civil, his message should not be interpreted as a call to violence.
“What I heard him say was, ‘You don’t always need to be polite and considerate,’” Olson said. “I think a lot of people in our community will be digesting that very thoughtful, robust exchange at this program tonight.”
According to Director for Jewish Life Rabbi Rachel Gartner, who offered introductory remarks, Black’s story highlights the danger of echo chambers in today’s political and cultural climate.
“As a Jew, I know the danger of speaking in echo chambers to people who only think the way we do,” Gartner said. “For someone from one side to break through those walls in a way that honors the others is such a powerful story that I believe is the hope for our future.”

While from what little I know of where Derek Black’s politics have gone, I can guarantee that we would disagree on many things (I’m a libertarian).
However, we definitely seem to agree more when it comes to how to deal with our shared, former associates… and the fact that white nationalism just doesn’t work. One reason it doesn’t work, is white nationalists themselves, IMO. Take the irony that WNs focus on family and ‘keeping white children safe’… yet most WNs are people that are likely never going to have a family… and are also not the type of people that most people want as neighbors or to be around their families.
That said, I have met a lot of WNs that I do respect even now… I still talk to a few. All know how I feel. Not all are bad people. Many are decent people that wear blinders when it comes to the types of people that dominate that movement. Some are just misguided. Some, that I have noticed in very recent discussions with WNs… acknowledge all the problems with white nationalism… but are simply continuing to be a part of it either by habit.. or as a kneejerk reaction to the anti-WN crowd….
[…] after the inauguration, the Georgetown University Lecture Fund hosted former white nationalist scion Derek Black. The one-time rising star of the white nationalist movement explained that while he was in college, […]

In a recent study by The New York Times, Georgetown University ranked 12th out of a list of 38 schools with more students in the top 1 percent of the income scale than in the bottom 60 percent.
While Georgetown ranks poorly for socioeconomic inclusivity, the report also showed that at Georgetown a poor student has a better chance of ending up in a higher income quintile than at other schools.
In a series of interviews with The Hoya, university administrators discussed how the country’s education system is skewed toward the upper classes, as well as the administration’s efforts to improve socioeconomic diversity at Georgetown.
One of Many
According to the Jan. 18 study, which was based on anonymous tax records, the median income for a parent of Georgetown’s class of 2013 was $229,100, the eighth-highest of the 2,395 colleges surveyed. Twenty-one percent of Georgetown’s approximately 6,700 undergraduates are from the top 1 percent, which is among the highest for the 10 member schools in the Big East Conference.
Students whose families make $630,000 or more per year are considered part of the 1 percent, according to the Times’ methodology. Students whose families make less than $65,000 annually are classified as part of the bottom 60 percent, which accounts for 13.5 percent of undergraduate students at Georgetown.
While the data in The New York Times study spans students born between 1980 and 1991, the number of students from the bottom 60 percent and top 1 percent remained consistent for every year.
Seventy-four percent of Georgetown’s undergraduate student body come from the top 20 percent, with the average Georgetown student in the 85th income percentile.
This situation is not unique to Georgetown, however. Across the country, approximately 25 percent of students from the top 1 percent enroll in an Ivy League or some other elite university, whereas less than 0.5 percent of students from the bottom 20 percent attend a similarly elite college. Furthermore, fewer than half of students from the bottom 20 percent even attend college.
The New York Times broke down the colleges into several groups, with Georgetown in the “elite schools” category along with universities such as Tufts University and the University of Notre Dame. The selectivity tiers used in the report are based on a 2009 index created by college ranking guide Barron’s, and the report’s rankings are based on incomes calculated using records of 30 million students who graduated between 2002 and 2013 from more than 2,000 American colleges.
Georgetown’s socioeconomic demographics are far from representative of national trends. In 2013, 4.8 percent of the U.S. population had a household income over $200,000, and 48 percent of the population had a household income below $50,000. At Georgetown, 74 percent of students come from households with an income above $110,000, while 3.1 percent come from families with an annual income of $20,000 or less.
Moving Across Income Boundaries
In addition to shedding light on the socioeconomic backgrounds of Georgetown students, the study also showed signs of mobility: After graduation, 1.9 percent of Georgetown graduates between 2002 and 2013 moved from the bottom to top income quintile, and 11 percent of students moved up at least two income quintiles.
While 3.1 percent of Georgetown students are from the bottom 20 percent, a student from the bottom fifth of incomes has a 61 percent chance of moving up to the top 20 percent of incomes after graduation, according to the study.
In fact, 69 percent of Georgetown alumni end up in the top 20 percent after graduation. By the time they are 34 years old, the median individual income for Georgetown alumni is $84,400.
Compared to other universities, however, Georgetown still lacks socioeconomic mobility. Georgetown has the lowest number of students who end up in bottom 20 percent after graduation among all universities in Washington, D.C., with only 8 percent of its undergraduates falling in that income bracket.
In the Times’ mobility index, which incorporates both access and outcomes to illustrate the likelihood of a student moving up two or more income quintiles, Georgetown is ranked 1985th out of 2,137 colleges. This puts Georgetown on par with or better than other elite schools, with Princeton ranked 2,096th and Duke at 2,014th.
Attempts to Diversify
Although Georgetown’s class size is similar to schools like Notre Dame, Dean of Admissions Charles Deacon said the university competes for admissions with schools in most selective category, dubbed “Ivy Plus.” Among these schools are institutions such as Princeton University, Stanford University, the University of Chicago and Duke University. Deacon said this fact makes Georgetown less socioeconomically diverse.
“Georgetown’s status as essentially an Ivy Plus school attracts people from the highest end, who can pay,” Deacon said.
Senior Director of Communications Rachel Pugh said the university is committed to fostering a student body that is as diverse as possible through a series of programs intended to increase socioeconomic diversity at the university.
Georgetown has a series of programs intended to increase socioeconomic diversity at the university, including the Community Scholars Program, which seeks to create a more diverse student body, the Georgetown Scholarship Program, which targets first-generation and low-income college students, and the American Talent Initiative, a nationwide effort to increase access for low-income students.
“Georgetown is committed to recruiting and supporting a diverse student body through a range of programs and initiatives, including the Community Scholars Program, the Georgetown Scholarship Program, and American Talent Initiative among others,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Pugh said Georgetown’s need-blind, full-need admission and financial aid policies allow the university to meet the financial needs of its students.
“The university’s commitment to financial aid remains strong for the next fiscal year, with funding budgeted at more than $180 million,” Pugh wrote. “Nearly 40 percent of the undergraduate student body received need-based scholarship aid in the last fiscal year.”
Georgetown is one of only a few dozen colleges that provides need-blind, full-need admission and financial aid policies.
The Georgetown Scholarship Program, beyond seeking to increase the number of first-generation and low-income students at Georgetown, also helps those students transition to the university. Ninety-six percent of GSP students graduate within four years, while nationally, 64 percent of first generation students graduate within four years, according to a 2011 study by the Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA.
GSP Director Missy Foy (COL ’03) said that the university’s efforts are commendable given the size of its endowment compared with other schools it competes with for applicants.
“You have a lot of students coming in from that top 1 percent, perhaps more so than peer institutions, but other than that we are not out of line from our peer schools, and we have a fraction of the endowment,” Foy said. “Even schools that have a huge endowment are struggling to get students from the bottom fifth to apply and enroll.”
A Limiting Endowment
Georgetown’s socioeconomic situation is complicated by the university’s endowment, which amounts to about $1.5 billion as of the 2015 fiscal year. According to a 2015 Study of Endowments by the National Association of College and University Business Officers, Duke has an endowment of about $7.3 billion and Notre Dame’s endowment is about $8.6 billion. At the highest end end of the spectrum, Stanford University and Harvard University have endowments around $22.2 billion and $36.5 billion.
While Notre Dame’s endowment is approximately six times that of Georgetown, 75 percent of its 8,448 undergraduates come from the top 20th percentile, 1 percent more than at Georgetown, but only 1.6 percent come from the bottom 20 percent.
At Duke, 69 percent of its 6,471 undergraduates come from the top 20 percent. About 1.6 percent of students at Duke who are from the bottom 20 percent end up in the top 20 percent after graduation, 0.3 percent less than the Georgetown students who make the same socioeconomic jump.
Deacon said top universities must make a concerted effort to attract students from across the income spectrum.
“For the elite schools in particular, there are not as many students who have the same kind of credentials, so you have to essentially put a thumb on the scale to look past lower scores and see the whole story,” Deacon said.
Toward a Less Disparate Future
Some Georgetown administrators believe the school’s endowment puts a limit on socioeconomic diversity, and have identified steps to make improvements.
Foy said she believes the main issue causing Georgetown’s lack of socioeconomic diversity is a lack of sufficient scholarship funds. For the 2016 fiscal year, 23.2 percent of Georgetown’s endowment contributed to undergraduate student scholarships, which includes the funds for GSP.
“Where we are truly struggling is in terms of money,” Foy said. “I would like to see more donations to current use or the endowment so we can enhance our scholarship packages and bring in a more diverse population.”
According to Foy, the percentage of students on financial aid is a more detailed indication of a school’s socioeconomic landscape than the income percentiles and quintiles used by The New York Times.
“From what we’re seeing, 10 percent of students can identify with a low-income experience. Forty-five percent of Georgetown students are receiving some form of financial aid,” Foy said. “Financial aid is a bit more nuanced than income quintile.”
Georgetown University Student Association Vice President Chris Fisk (COL ’17) said as Georgetown expands its endowment, he expects the university to become more socioeconomically diverse.
“As our capacity to offer financial assistance to prospective students expands, I’m sure Georgetown will be able to shift the scales a bit more with regard to the socioeconomic diversity of its student population,” Fisk said.
Looking ahead, Foy said The New York Times report should not be perceived as an attack on wealthy students, but instead spark a conversation about socioeconomic diversity at Georgetown.
“This isn’t to vilify wealthy students,” Foy said. “We want them here. But I think the question is: What should the distribution be?”

Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) reiterated Washington, D.C.’s status as a sanctuary city at a press conference Wednesday after President Donald Trump’s administration threatened to strip sanctuary cities of federal grant money the same day.
Sanctuary cities and states refuse to hand over individuals who entered the country illegally to deportation forces when they are arrested for unrelated charges.
Bowser’s statement is the latest from local government officials pushing back against the new administration’s conservative policies.  As a federal and majority Democrat territory, the District’s lawmakers cannot spend local tax dollars in ways that conflict with the federal government’s spending rules.
Her announcement took place before House Republicans who have oversight over District affairs sent Bowser a letter Thursday warning her that the plan could violate federal law.
In the letter, House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), head of the subcommittee for District affairs, warned Bowser that the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 prohibits government officials from using taxpayer funds to assist individuals without documentation from legally challenging deportation orders.
Trump’s executive order, issued Wednesday, mandates cutting off federal funds for cities that refuse to inform federal immigration officials about individuals without documentation in police custody.
The order, titled “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,” states that local law enforcement officials who do not ask about citizenship status are will fully violating federal law. According to the American Immigrant Council, one in seven D.C. residents is an immigrant.
In response to the executive order, Bowser said Wednesday that maintaining D.C.’s status as a sanctuary city is especially important because of the fear she has observed among immigrant communities in the District in recent weeks.
Bowser said D.C.’s status becomes a matter of public safety in the event that immigrants without documentation are facing domestic abuse, illness or addiction issues, but are afraid to seek municipal resources out of fear of deportation.
“The values, laws, and policies of Washington, D.C., did not change on Election Day,” Bowser wrote in a press release. “We are a sanctuary city because we know that our neighborhoods are safer and stronger when no one is afraid to call on our government for help, and when our police can focus on protecting and serving.”
Bowser also faces opposition in Congress from Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Penn.), who introduced the Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Act on Jan. 3 to implement Trump’s plan to ban all federal funds from being used in sanctuary cities.
Barletta’s spokesperson Tim Murtaugh said the bill was important in establishing the federal government’s central role in enforcing border security.
“No mayor of any city or town in the United States can pick and choose which federal laws to obey,” Murtaugh said in an interview with The Hoya. “It is a federal responsibility to police the borders of the United States, and to openly defy federal immigration laws is irresponsible. And there should be repercussions.”
At the press conference, Bowser emphasized she is opposed to any federal policy that prohibits D.C.’s local government from providing services to its residents.
“Anything that would suggest that the government not work with an American city is worrisome,” Bowser said at the press conference. “Obviously, there are a lot of things that we do in cities in partnership with our government, and we would object, and we do object, to anything that the federal government wants to do to a local jurisdiction that would make it less safe.”
United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which oversees deportation programs across the country, has yet to implement any new policies regarding illegal immigration under the Trump administration.
ICE Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Rodriguez said ICE is not anticipating major policy changes. According to Rodriguez, the organization will continue their administration of the Priority Enforcement Program, which identifies potential immigrants without authorization among those who are under attest or sentenced to a crime, in addition to maintaining their support for local law enforcement.
“PEP is a balanced, common-sense approach that places the focus where it should be: on criminals and individuals who threaten the public safety,” Rodriguez said in an interview with The Hoya. “ICE is committed to working with its law enforcement partners nationwide to achieve that mission.”
D.C. Metropolitan Police Department Chief Peter Newsham also reaffirmed that MPD is not anticipating any major policy changes and will continue acting under the directives of the Bowser administration.
“One of the messages that we wanted to send to folks was that in Washington, D.C., things are not going to change,” Newsham said in a press conference Jan. 20.
However, some immigration activists feel Bowser’s statements fail to fully protect immigrant communities in the District. Sapna Pandya, executive director of Many Languages One Voice, an immigration advocacy group, said she would like Bowser to commit to providing more tangible resources to area immigrant groups.
“I didn’t like that she didn’t add any stronger policy pieces. It was merely a statement that we’re a welcoming city, and we’re a diverse city, but that’s about it. My reaction, as well as the reaction of the people I work with, was that that’s just not enough,” Pandya said.
Pandya added that she hopes the local government will put aside funds for housing, healthcare, education and the implementation of labor laws.
Luis Gonzalez (COL ’19), a student without documentation, said he was pleased to see Bowser committing to the District’s status as a sanctuary city, because of the large immigrant population in the District.
“D.C. has a significant immigrant community and these people are part of the broader community and they should be protected,” Gonzalez said. “I really like that Mayor Bowser reaffirmed her commitment to a key constituency, a key part of the city. This makes me think that Mayor Bowser really knows where D.C. stands and what we value.”
On Thursday, Georgetown’s Senior Director of Communications Rachel Pugh confirmed the university is committed to supporting students without documentation following the hiring of an advisor for undocumented students on campus last year.

As Washington, D.C., prepares for today’s March for Life, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced an increase in its midday service throughout the city. The D.C. Metropolitan Police Department announced the closure of a number of streets between the White House and the U.S. Capitol Building.
The annual anti-abortion rights march is scheduled to begin with a rally at noon near the corner of 15th St. and Constitution Ave., north of the Washington Monument. Protesters plan to march east along Constitution Ave. toward First St. NE and plan to end in front of the U.S. Supreme Court building.
The gathering, which is motivated by the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision on abortion, is expected to draw tens of thousands of demonstrators to the city where an estimated 500,000 protesters gathered to attend the Women’s March last Saturday.
WMATA General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld said that Metro will boost service between the morning and evening rush hours, meaning trains on each line will run about every eight minutes, resulting in service every two to four minutes at downtown stations. Metro will run more eight-car trains — the longest train length possible — in addition to cancelling all midday track work and staffing stations with additional employees to assist visitors.
The march’s main impact on D.C. commuters is predicted to be during the afternoon rush hour, with most street closures taking effect after 8 a.m. Police will close streets along Constitution Avenue from 17th St. to First St. from around 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. as the march proceeds.
Multiple Georgetown groups are planning or participating in the march and counter-protests around the Mall.
Georgetown Right to Life President Amelia Irvine (COL ’19) said that though she was disappointed by the lack of university support, the group is attending the march.
“We at Georgetown Right to Life are proud to attend the March for Life every year despite lack of support from the Georgetown administration. We petitioned the university for an excused absence for students who wish to attend the March, but our request was denied,” Irvine wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Still, dedicated, pro-life students will join the march tomorrow.”
H*yas For Choice Co-President Emily Stephens (SFS ’17) said that the group’s members will participate in counter-protests especially given several executive actions of President Donald Trump, including banning U.S. aid to support abortion services overseas.
“We view this as an opportunity to register our dissent with the anti-choice values the march promotes, and to show our continued support for abortion access nationwide,” Stephens wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Just in the last few days, several violent and virulently anti-choice policies have been introduced by Donald Trump and anti-choice politicians in the U.S. Congress and state legislatures.”
Stephens said her group’s presence is important to demonstrate opposition to Trump’s actions.
“These policies will unequivocally place the lives and quality of life of millions of people in jeopardy, particularly people of color, low-income people and people living in rural communities,” Stephens wrote. “We feel that now, more than ever, showing up in person at this type of event helps to demonstrate that, in fact, the majority of Americans, like H*yas for Choice, recognize the danger of overturning or lessening the protections afforded by Roe v. Wade.”
Georgetown University College Republicans President Alexandra Williams (SFS ’19) said that she encourages students to demonstrate with Right to Life.
“We are expecting many members of GUCR to participate and are in full support of their right to do so. We have coordinated with Right to Life and are proud of our members who will be marching in the pursuit of protecting unborn lives,” Williams said.
Georgetown University College Democrats Chair Meredith Forsyth (SFS ’19) said she encourages students to demonstrate against the March for Life.
“GUCD encourages members to attend the counter-protest at the Supreme Court, along with H*yas for Choice, in support of Planned Parenthood and other organizations fighting for reproductive freedom, in celebration of the anniversary of Roe v. Wade and with the view that the rights the decision enshrines may be under threat in the near future,” Forsyth wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Georgetown Right to Life Vice President MyLan Metzger (COL ’19) said that although she is a registered Democrat and supports much of the Democratic Party’s platform, her religious beliefs prompt her to attend the March for Life.
“I’m attending the March for Life because I think that it is an important human rights issue. I first and foremost consider myself a supporter of Catholic Social Thought, which upholds the dignity of all human life from conception to natural death,” Metzger said. “For this reason, I have always considered myself pro-life and will be attending my third March for Life.”
Metzger added that the discussion around abortion does not have to be a polarizing issue.
“There is a shrinking number of pro-life Democrats in America due to increased polarization,” Metzger said. “By attending the March for Life, I hope to convey that I support many of these more ‘progressive Democratic’ principles not despite being pro-life, but because I am pro-life. However, the Democrat’s care for the poor, sick or displaced should start at conception.”

Lonnie G. Bunch III, founding director of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture, received an honorary degree from Georgetown University in a ceremony in Gaston Hall on Jan. 25.
Since its opening on Sept. 24, 2016, the museum adjacent to the Washington Monument has welcomed about 1 million visitors, according to the university’s website.
The degree ceremony included musical performances by the Georgetown University Concert Choir and a composition by Nolan Williams Jr., “We Choose to Remember,” which was first performed at the Let Freedom Ring! celebration in the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Jan. 16.
Associate professor of history Marcia Chatelain stressed the need to confront the legacy of slavery as well as the violence African Americans still face today in the ceremony’s opening prayer.
“We pray that we continue to honor the legacy of the slave, the sharecropper, the marcher, the marginalized, the incarcerated and the ignored,” Chatelain said. “Let us pray for the peaceful rest for those we lost to violence and comfort the families who weep. We pray for the souls of Tanisha, of Sandra, of Freddie, of Trayvon, of Michael, of Renisha, of LaQuan, and of Natasha.”
Maurice Jackson, associate professor in the history department and African-American studies program, delivered Bunch’s honorary degree citation. Jackson emphasized how Bunch’s grandfather and father, Lionel Bunch Sr. and Jr., sparked a passion for history in Bunch from a young age.
“It is Georgetown University’s honor to recognize an extraordinary historian and human being who shares with us a complete understanding of our nation’s history,” Jackson said. “As a young man, Mr. Bunch developed a passion for history inspired by his family.”
University President John J. DeGioia praised Bunch’s efforts at delivering the truth and showcasing the relevance of history.
“It is a privilege to have this opportunity to celebrate this extraordinary individual and his life-long commitment to helping us more fully understand that basic truth,” DeGioia said in reference to the importance of history.
Bunch said his honorary degree was not just honoring him, but rather the many people who had supported his efforts in creating the museum.
“This honor means so much to me because it is an affirmation of the efforts of so many,” Bunch said. “While you hear stories about me, it’s really because of the work of so many people. The fact that thousands of people supported this museum, gave money, gave collections, gave their stories, gave their trust, because of that we were able to birth this museum.”
Bunch said the museum seeks to remember all aspects of the history of African Americans.
“It is crucially important at this museum to tell the unvarnished truth. It must be a place where you are going to cry when you ponder the pain of slavery and segregation,” Bunch said. “It has to be a place that says America must confront itself. For us, this museum had to be a place where people actually found the truth.”

The Georgetown Scholarship Program is working toward operating from its own endowment within the next two years, and it is already nearly halfway to its endowment goal of $25 million.
The endowment would be allocated not to providing scholarships for GSP students, but instead to maintaining the operations of GSP. GSP Director Missy Foy (COL ’03) said the separate endowment will allow GSP to operate independently of the university.
“Everything that we do out of GSP, aside from the actual scholarships, will be done by the endowment, so we won’t cost the university anything anymore,” Foy said.
The program raised approximately half the endowment goal in two years, according to Foy.
“Every day we find out about a new gift. Our board is extremely aggressive and effective with it,” Foy said.
GSP was founded in 2004 by Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (CAS ’64, GRD ’69) and Dean of Student Financial Services Patricia McWade to facilitate low-income and first-generation college students’ successful transition into life at Georgetown. One hundred seventy-eight students from the Class of 2020 joined the program, which currently serves 650 undergraduate students.
GSP offers its students a range of services, including in-house Counseling and Psychiatric Services office hours for students and partnerships with Jos. A. Bank and Ann Taylor LOFT to provide students with professional attire for internship and job interviews.
GSP Advisory Board Chair Michelle Mauboussin (MSB ’86) said the endowment’s completion would bring much-needed relief for the program.
“We’re always kind of, ‘Oh my gosh, are we going to have enough money to do this? Are we going to have enough money to do that?’ We’re always worried,” Mauboussin said. “The biggest thing is there are not enough staff members. They’re working so hard, and they love what they do, but they could use more support.”
The $25 million endowment would provide the program with about $1.25 million a year. The funds would help the program expand current opportunities for students, including professional development events, alongside an increase in the GSP Necessity Fund, a $300,000 fund that helps students cover unexpected expenses such as dental expenses or unexpected flights home.
While GSP’s office is currently located in the basement of Healy Hall, Mauboussin said she hopes the program can move into new offices once the endowment goal is met.
“If one of the staff is having a meeting with one of the students, they are basically in a cubicle with everyone walking by — there’s no privacy,” Mauboussin said. “One of the goals of the endowment is to move out of Healy basement and move into two townhouses side-by-side, have a nice living and learning space and have more privacy for meetings with students and staff.”
Mauboussin said socioeconomic and academic factors play a large role in selecting incoming freshmen to the program during the admissions process.
GSP students receive the 1789 Scholarship of about $3,000 per year, which seeks to reduce the cost of the loans many Georgetown students need to pay back after graduation.
Mauboussin said the 1789 Scholarship aims to bridge the gap between Georgetown’s financial aid packages and those of other peer institutions.
“Our financial aid packages aren’t that great, so GSP is a way to attract these top-notch, amazing students to Georgetown’s campus,” Mauboussin said.
GSP Assistant Director Corey Stewart (SFS ’15) said the fact that many universities, such as the University of Pennsylvania, now offer debt-free, loan-free financial aid in the form of grants, creates a huge competitive disadvantage for Georgetown.
“If Penn is offering you a no-loans package, obviously you’re going to choose Penn,” Stewart said.
Mauboussin said GSP’s programming and support for students beyond scholarships is what makes it unique.
“They might not have the support system at home where people are familiar with the whole system,” Mauboussin said. “If you’re only given a scholarship, you’re just kind of thrown in there, and it becomes a little sink-or-swim — a lot of people sink. With this support system, you have a much higher graduation rate, and you also have a much better experience.”
Correction: This article previously stated the GSP necessity fund is a $200,000 fund. This amount is inaccurate and is about $300,000. The article also previously stated the value of the 1789 scholarship is $2,000-$3,000; it is $3,000 annually.

Students of Georgetown, Inc., the Georgetown University Alumni Student Federal Credit Union and Georgetown Blue and Gray Tour Guides have made changes to their application processes for the spring application season to cultivate a more diverse pool of students.
These changes include developing new interview questions and increasing the number of people involved in hiring decisions.
The Corp plans to involve 19 of its members in the recruitment process, compared to its previous two members, to include different perspectives when making hiring decisions, according to The Corp’s CEO Taylor Tobin (COL ’17).
“Now, the store director — as well as the whole director’s team — has taken this on,” Tobin said. “This is crucial to moving our company forward beyond saying ‘Diversity is good’ to saying it needs to be ingrained into who we are. It’s so crucial.”
Tobin said The Corp will also change the types of questions it asks during interviews.
“We’re changing our questions to be more professionally focused and more straightforward and away from the stereotype of the ‘Corp-y Corpie,’” Tobin said. “Then, we hope that helps to level the playing field.”
Corp Director of Human Resources Isabella Todaro (SFS ’16) said the changes were prompted by a belief within club leadership that it could do a better job of having fairer applications, geared toward students of varied backgrounds.
“We know that historically Georgetown has problems with this, so it’s idealistic, but I would like to see a Corp that’s even more diverse and inclusive than Georgetown,” Todaro said. “As an institution, we have a history of being an advocating body that pushes Georgetown towards good, that’s why we were founded.”
Tobin said expanded diversity was needed not only for the new hire pool but within the existing club culture as well.
“It’s important for Georgetown because for Georgetown to be their very best, it means embracing everyone’s whole selves. That’s what this is all about,” Tobin said. “We want every single employee to be able to bring their whole selves to The Corp and to really thrive in this community, and we also want this community to represent all of Georgetown.”
In a letter published on its Facebook page, The Corp said an internal climate survey drew attention to the lack of diversity.
“The Corp was founded to make sure that the many voices of the student body are heard and to serve our community’s diverse needs. Our hiring has not reflected these values,” the letter reads. “Though we didn’t need numbers to tell us this, after an internal climate survey, our lack of diversity became strikingly clear.”
The Corp also created a diversity working group to create plans on post-hiring policies. The group came out of a diversity town hall, during which students of different backgrounds shared their experiences of inclusion or exclusion, according to Penn Conrad (MSB ’20), an employee at Vital Vittles.
According to Blue and Gray Outreach Coordinator Matt Treacy (COL ’19), Blue and Gray edited the spring application questions to be more in line with the roles and responsibilities of being a tour guide.
“When we first started doing summer hiring for summer guides, we completely scrapped all of the interview questions that we used in the past. We felt like they were kind of frustrating because nobody really cares what kind of character would play you in a movie,” Treacy said. “We only selected questions that are more situational, as well as incorporating a tour portion.”
Treacy said he hopes the new questions will not only cultivate a more diverse pool of applicants, but help the tour guides more accurately reflect the student body as a whole, to best represent Georgetown.
“Blue and Gray, more than other groups, certainly has a responsibility to be more diverse and more representative of Georgetown because we are a lot of prospective students’ first contact with Georgetown,” Treacy said. “When we stand up on a stage and prospective students see us as a group of ambassadors for the university, they want to see someone that they can connect with.”
GUASFCU has also worked to reach out to clubs on campus that are not well represented within its organization, according to Graham Ritter (MSB ’19), a member of GUASFCU’s Diversity and Inclusion Committee.
“We’re also reaching out to different resource centers and cultural groups on campus to make sure that they know about us and that they know about the new hiring processes,” Ritter said. “For example, I reached out to the LGBTQ Resource Center and got ourselves on their listserv.”
Although these changes are being implemented this semester, leaders said it may take time for the changes to become noticeable in the cultures and demographics of their organizations.
For the time being, Todaro said it is important to take steps toward integrating students of different backgrounds into Georgetown’s biggest organizations.
“We hope that by taking such a public stance on this, other clubs see it and try to make the same effort. We’re certainly not perfect, but we take this very seriously,” Todaro said. “We want to take the steps to be more diverse.”

The Georgetown administration declined to disclose a list of companies the university invests in, following advocacy group Georgetown University Forming a Radically Ethical Endowment Coalition’s request last month to create a more transparent endowment.
GU F.R.E.E, which has been endorsed by 17 student groups, submitted a letter Dec. 7 to University President John J. DeGioia demanding that the university divest from investments in private prisons and companies that contribute to the “occupation of Palestine.”
The group set a deadline for a response by Jan. 13, which university officials missed.
Members of GU F.R.E.E. want more transparency from university officials about how Georgetown uses its endowment.
The coalition is endorsed by groups advocating for underrepresented populations and groups that support Palestinian independence from Israel, including the Georgetown chapter of the NAACP as well as GU Students for Justice in Palestine.
The Jewish Student Alliance, J Street U Georgetown and the Georgetown Israel Alliance are not members of the coalition.
Chief of Staff Joseph Ferrara said in an email to GU F.R.E.E. provided to The Hoya that the university’s standard practice is to not disclose its investments.
GU F.R.E.E. said the campaign will continue to press for a list of investments.
“The administration’s refusal to sign our letter indicates to us that we have some sort of relationship with the named companies and as such, we will move forward with our campaign,” GU F.R.E.E. wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh said the university’s Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility, which advises the university on its investments, is considering the demands listed in the group’s December letter.
J Street U Georgetown said in a statement that “Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions” movements like GU F.R.E.E’s are ineffective in achieving a two-state solution, its preferred solution to the conflict between Palestine and Israel. J Street instead called for constructive criticism of Israeli policy rather than calls for taking away funding for Israeli companies.
“We do not believe that B.D.S. movements are an effective or helpful way to to end the conflict and reach a peaceful resolution,” the statement reads. “We encourage positive reinvestment into the Palestinian economy and civil society and diplomatic negotiation as a means to achieve a lasting peace agreement.”
GU F.R.E.E. has said it did not plan on inviting J Street U Georgetown.
J Street U’s statement, however, noted that those involved with GU F.R.E.E. have been willing to discuss their position with student groups opposed to their message. The group affirmed their support for Palestinian rights.
“We have met with individuals involved in the GU FREE campaign and appreciate their willingness to explain their position and support the safety of all students on campus,” the statement read.
GU F.R.E.E. launched an official website and campaign Wednesday. The group plans to raise awareness of the issues affecting underrepresented populations as it pushes the university to pursue a more transparent endowment, according to the group.
“We intend to raise awareness and constructive conversation surrounding both issues to problematize the normalization of these human rights violations,” the statement reads. “We plan to put pressure on the University until it recognizes the glaring contradictions of our Jesuit values and subsidization of state violence via our investment practices.”

Five supervisors and 16 other employees of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s inspection department have been fired for falsifying inspection records, WMATA General Manager Paul Wiedefeld confirmed Thursday.
After a track derailment in Falls Church, Va., in July, WMATA announced an investigation into inspection records. The investigation uncovered falsified records on the Silver Line.
Wiedefeld said falsified records were not found on other lines, and that WMATA inspected over 60 tracks throughout the network. Wiedefeld told The Washington Post on Thursday that he is still confident in the capacity of the WMATA inspection team.
“We have a good track department,” Wiedefeld said. “In terms of our management folks and line people and our contractors we have out there, we’re very confident of what we’re seeing out there in terms of the inspections.”
Wiedefeld said the records are still under inspection, and that he will comment on the investigation at a WMATA board meeting later this month.
Track inspector Lawrence Simmons said that in an interview with WMATA during the initial Silver Line investigation, he and his colleagues were repeatedly asked to ignore track conditions and to report that tracks were up to the standards set by the Federal Transit Administration.
“I’m not going to say they knew about a wide gauge, but they knew something is going on there, because they put a Band-Aid on it,” Simmons said. “And in this company, they do a lot of that. You know, they put on Band-Aids.”
Amalgamated Transit Union Local 689, which represents WMATA employees, said Thursday they will contest the firings, stating that WMATA has yet to provide sufficient evidence of the falsified records.
Union Vice President Raymond Jackson told The Washington Post that workers were given unfair assignments, possibly putting pressure on workers to falsify records.
“If you give me an assignment to do 37 switches, and you know that it’s an un-completable task,” Jackson said. “If you’re my manager, then why are you giving me this assignment?”
WMATA Chief Safety Officer Patrick Lavin also announced a series of recent safety incidents. On Jan. 4, a worker sustained an electric shock after accidentally placing a metal gauge on the tracks. On Tuesday, the door on a Yellow Line train opened while the the train was stopped on a raised platform at Reagan National Airport.
Grady Willard (SFS ’18) said although he was surprised to hear about the falsified documents, he is glad WMATA is treating the issue with transparency.
“It’s much better to have a safe system rather than a system that might be ready on paper but run into derailments like the one we saw last summer,” Willard said. “Wiedefeld has done a good job of prioritizing that.”

Israeli actions, including the development of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, are putting the pursuit of a two-state solution to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at risk, according to Maen Rashid Areikat, chief representative of the General Delegation of the Palestinian Liberation Organization to the United States, in the ICC Auditorium on Thursday.
“The best approach to resolve this conflict is going back to the basics. The basics of freedom, human rights, dignity, security, peace for all,” Areikat said. “If we all can agree that every nation, every people are entitled to the same rights, to the same privileges, to the same freedoms that other nations are entitled to, I believe we can always find a solution to the most difficult issues.”
School of Foreign Service professor Tamara Sonn, the Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani Professor in the History of Islam, introduced Areikat, who addressed a crowd of about 150.
Areikat said the United States, under President Donald Trump’s administration, must work with Israel to pursue a two-state solution. Areikat criticized the Trump administration’s reported efforts to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which both Palestine and Israel claim as their capital.
“They will only embolden Israel to be more aggressive and to rely on the logic of power, instead of the power of logic, in dealing with its neighbors and resolving conflicts,” Areikat said.
While promoting a peaceful resolution to the conflict, Areikat blamed the strife’s perpetuity on Israeli intransigence, suggesting that a continuation of Israel’s settlement policy in the West Bank could lead to a failure of the two-state solution.
Both Israel and Palestine have said a two-state solution, with an independent State of Israel and State of Palestine, is their preferred solution to the conflict. The two sides, however, have been unable to agree on border placement, among other issues, in attempts to strike a deal.
“We still believe that a two-state solution is the most ideal outcome for any political negotiations with Israel,” Areikat said. “Israelis and Palestinians must be separated in order for them — especially Palestinians — to develop their own national identity away from occupation and oppression, and for Israelis to reap the fruits of the peace and security that they have long desired.”
The PLO officially recognized the right of Israel to exist in the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords. According to Areikat, Palestine does not pose a danger to Israel.
However, Areikat said the only path to stability for Israel in the region is a settlement with Palestine.
“Israel’s security will be guaranteed if they make peace with the Palestinians who are going to share the land with them. They cannot make peace with any other Arab countries if they cannot make peace with us. They will never enjoy security,” Areikat said. “It’s not because we are threatening them; it’s because there will be no stability if we Palestinians do not feel that we are getting our rights back.”
Delta Phi Epsilon, Georgetown’s professional foreign service fraternity, arranged the event, but as an unrecognized student group without access to benefits, needed Sonn to reserve the auditorium.
Areikat said Arabs and Palestinians prioritize resolving this conflict, even if some Israel advocates say surrounding Arab nations do not care about it as much as other conflicts in the region.
“No matter what Israel tries to portray that Arab countries are busy and the Palestinian issue is on the backburner — maybe that applies to some Arab governments, but it does not apply to the Arab masses who continue to believe that the Palestinian people are an oppressed people who need to win their freedom,” Areikat said. “We continue to extend our hands for peace, but it takes two to tango.”

Both the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union and Students of Georgetown, Inc. are planning to formally welcome their new senior leadership teams in March.
New Corp CEO Melina Hsiao (COL ’18), who formerly worked at The Hilltoss, said she is looking to improve The Corp’s relationship with students.
“I’m really excited for the opportunity to improve The Corp’s relationship with campus,” Hsiao said. “I don’t mean this so much in the sense of the reputation, but of how we can be a positive entity in the lives of students.”
Hsiao is joined by incoming Vice President and COO Chris Caminiti (MSB ’19), who formerly worked at MUG, and Treasurer and CFO Jared D’Sa (COL ’19), a former member of the accounting division.
Hsiao said she is also looking to make The Corp more inclusive. The Corp, along with other student groups including GUASFCU and Blue & Gray Tour Guide Society, is seeking to make hiring more inclusive this spring by changing interview questions and expanding the number of people involved in hiring.
“I hope I can leave my term having seen a great deal of change in that direction and have confidence that the work will continue going forward,” Hsiao said. “I’m also hoping to make The Corp a more transparent institution for both employees and the Georgetown community.”
Incoming GUASFCU CEO Rupert Kingshott (MSB ’18) said he is excited to take the reins of the university’s credit union.
“It’s an organization that has meant a lot to me, and it’s helped me mature myself. And so the fact that I’m now giving back to it and really in control is very exciting,” Kingshott said. “It’s been quite surreal, to be honest.”
Kingshott is joined by Chief Financial Officer Max Hartley (MSB ’18), Chief Operating Officer and Chairman Michael Mumma (COL ’18), Chief Development Officer Shannon Hou (SFS ’18), Chief Technology Officer Nick Matz (COL ’18), Treasurer Ben Brothers (MSB ’18) and Chief Lending Officer Isabel Singal (MSB ’18).
Kingshott is set to take control of the credit union two years after starting out as a teller. Kingshott said the credit union is gearing up for an active semester, including planning for 35th anniversary celebrations.
The credit union is also rolling out a new online banking platform called NARMI, which was created by former GUASFCU interns.
“We’re currently rolling out a very, very modern online banking platform that was actually created by two old GUASFCU interns, and it’s something they learned from their experience at the credit union,” Kingshott said. “And now they’ve started this company called NARMI, and they’re using us to really just roll it out.”
The full rollout of the platform is not yet complete. However, Mumma said it will be a boon to the credit union’s members.
“We’ll be releasing more detail hopefully in the next few weeks,” Mumma said. “The whole point is to provide more convenient banking for our members from anywhere.”
The new leaders have said they hope the new platform will forge stronger ties between the credit union and students.
“We’re looking to be a bigger fixture in the community,” Mumma said. “We want to show students we’re here for them.”
