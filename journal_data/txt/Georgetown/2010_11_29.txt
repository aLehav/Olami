Colleges and universities will be required by law to post net price calculators allowing students to estimate the cost of matriculation on their websites by October 2011.
But striking a balance between simplicity and accuracy in online net cost calculators poses a challenge for universities like Georgetown, where methods for determining allocation of aid are highly personalized.
While students must wait to receive their financial aid packages until just a few weeks before the enrollment deadline, the new law will help them gauge the affordability of each school farther in advance before hearing back officially about their aid totals.
Georgetown does not yet have a calculator posted on its website but has plans to make one available next fall, according to university spokeswoman Julie Bataille.
While its standard tuition and fees combined may seem daunting, the university hopes a net cost calculator will help.
“We want admitted and current students to understand that financial assistance is available to meet their full demonstrated financial need so that cost is not a barrier to attending Georgetown,” Bataille said in an email.
Multiple factors go into deciding a student’s financial aid sum; creating a one-size-fits-all calculator that consistently returns accurate results for a wide range of financial situations poses difficulties.
Many universities have also expressed concern that the tool may not be user-friendly. In order for families to take advantage of such net cost calculators, they must be simple, straightforward, quick and not bogged down in long lists of obscure questions.
At Georgetown, when determining aid, a financial aid officer personally reviews each student’s financial situation and allocates aid based on information provided in the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, the College Scholarship Services Profile/Financial Aid PROFILE as well as student and parent tax returns to create a package that meets 100 percent of a family’s demonstrated need.
The hope is that through these net cost calculators, families will receive a realistic picture of what attending both private and public institutions will really cost them.
“I had so many friends who wouldn’t even apply to schools that they could have gotten into [if they were] really expensive,” Erin Auel (COL ’14) said.
However, the results provided by the calculator are only estimates. With different schools using different formulas to generate estimates, there is no guarantee that comparing costs at various institutions will be accurate.
The state of Texas, however, already has a calculator in place to make the aid comparisons many skeptics call unreliable. At www.collegeforalltexans.com, families can compare what they would pay at any public university and a few private colleges in the state.

The website WikiLeaks made headlines again this Sunday when it released a new set of U.S. government classified documents. This new installment of controversial publications from WikiLeaks, following the July and October disclosures, sheds unparalleled light on the behind-the-scenes diplomacy that has increasingly dominated American foreign policy over the past several years. These documents have given the American public a detailed look at the way policies are conducted abroad, including candid assessments of terrorist threats and foreign leaders.
The cables contain specific information on the potential collapse of North Korea, negotiations with foreign powers to resettle inmates from Guantanamo, a report from a Chinese source that the Politburo in Beijing was responsible for hacking Google in a complex computer sabotage campaign and a shadowy alliance between Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. But many of these documents could also compromise American intelligence operations and significantly endanger those identified as foreign informants.
It is impossible to deny that public knowledge of American diplomatic and military efforts improves government accountability to its citizens. Previous WikiLeaks releases of official documents describing American operations in Afghanistan have provided citizens an inside look at the direction of the war overseas, which in the long run will improve political transparency and accountability. This most recent release of documents should provide similar benefits to the public.
Unfortunately, these improvements have also led to considerable security risks. For the release of every classified document providing Americans with an uncensored look at foreign policy developments, a foreign informant – essentially a spy for American intelligence officers – is put in danger. Covers are blown, intelligence networks are dismantled and American case officers are forced to go back to square one in their efforts to provide diplomats and military officers with the information necessary to protect American citizens at home and abroad.
uch of the classified information the U.S. government keeps from public eyes is unnecessarily kept secret. “Operational security” is a very broadly defined term according to the Pentagon, CIA and other government agencies. Some pieces of intelligence should be kept inviolate, however, including the names of American sources and their handlers. Blowing the cover of just one important informant can lead to untold operational costs.
One diplomatic cable included in the recent WikiLeaks release, for example, quotes Saudi King Abdullah making “scathing remarks” (according to The New York Times) about the leaders of Iraq and Pakistan. One specifically calls Asif Ali Zardari, the president of Pakistan, the greatest obstacle to progress in his country.
By publishing comments like this, WikiLeaks seriously undermines American diplomatic efforts. Credibility collapses when secret discussions are made public, regardless of whether the records are released by a high-ranking officer or a bottom-rung enlisted soldier. The most recent set of documents was reportedly downloaded from military computers and submitted to WikiLeaks by Pfc. Bradley Manning, an Army intelligence analyst. Why, then, would King Abdullah continue to trust American diplomats? And how will Saudi-Iraqi or Saudi-Pakistani relations change following the release of King Abdullah’s remarks?
But these are only minor questions. The potential ramifications of the documents regarding Chinese attacks on Google servers and American and South Korean plans for invading North Korea after Pyongyang’s hypothetical collapse being made public are far more significant. These releases show all foreign powers, both friendly and hostile, that the United States is actively building contingency plans for dozens of potential security threats. In a period of heightened tensions in East Asia, particularly with North Korea following its recent rocket attacks on the South, these documents could counteract efforts to diplomatically resolve disputes in the region.
In a globalized world, it is no longer possible to release documents to just one group of people. If it were, the work WikiLeaks has done to increase transparency in Washington would be purely beneficial, perhaps even necessary, in supporting democracy and promoting liberty. However, information published on the Internet is available for anyone to access. This completely changes the dynamics of WikiLeaks to something akin to modern espionage, in effect no different from sending classified documents to America’s enemies. Put in this light, those behind the recent WikiLeaks, from the site owners to Manning, have committed treason.
This is what’s wrong with WikiLeaks – not the site’s attempts to promote transparency, but the detrimental ramifications these efforts can and almost certainly will have on American diplomatic endeavors. Lives are at stake, both military and civilian, foreign and domestic, all because top secret documents have been leaked on the Internet. While I’m not advocating mass treason and espionage convictions, the release of these documents is not something to take lightly.

Reflecting on his days as an academic, Turkey’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Ahmet Davutoglu spoke in Gaston Hall on Monday about Turkish foreign policy and his country’s relationship with the United States.
In his speech, Davutoglu emphasized Turkey’s importance in global affairs and the country’s hopes for greater global interdependence and peace.
“We want to have restoration in global politics, the global economy and global culture,” Davutoglu said. “We have a vision in Turkey . to create peaceful regional orders around us.”
Davutoglu worked in the academic world until November 2002, when he was appointed chief adviser to the prime minister and ambassador-at-large. He opened his speech by discussing his nostalgia for his life as an academic.
“People may think that once you have more power you have more freedom, but it is the opposite. Being a minister is hard,” he said. “You may have hundreds of ideas in your mind, but you have to have self-censorship.”
Eitan Paul (SFS ’12), chair of the International Relations Club, which co-sponsored the event, remarked on the academic influence on the speech.
“It was an interesting address in that he comes from a very intellectual and academic background,” Paul said.
In 2001, while he was a visiting lecturer at Turkey’s Military Academy, Davutoglu wrote “Stratejik Derinlik” (“Strategic Depth”). In it, he discusses the “zero problem with neighbors” theory, which emphasizes cooperation and establishing economic and cultural ties with neighbors rather than using sanctions or other harsh methods of diplomacy.
As minister of foreign affairs, a post he was appointed to in May 2009, Davutoglu has made his theory an integral part of Turkey’s foreign policy.
“My goal is to create a revolution in the old mentality of Turkish strategic thinking [that] all neighbors are enemies,” he said. “We need political restoration based on democratic values and economic restoration based on growth, but we can do it only if we restore our relations with our neighbors, with our allies and with new powers.”
Deflecting comments regarding Turkey’s conflicts with Greece and Israel last summer, Davutoglu said Turkey would work toward a common vision.
“Don’t worry, we will solve it,” he said.
“Turkey’s new approach to foreign policy is not without controversy,” Paul said. “A number of their positions are certainly less in line with U.S. policy and a Western approach to foreign policymaking.”
Kent Carlson (MSB ’14) felt that Davutoglu’s speech was very helpful for increasing his understanding of Turkey’s stance on various policies.
“I’d say he dodged some of the issues more than speaking candidly, but in the end he answered the questions, though not always fully,” he said. “

Mayor Adrian Fenty and his successor Vincent Gray have set out to reverse the $18 million deficit the D.C. government has accumulated.
Both have stressed the need to avoid tax hikes. The revised budget Fenty released on Nov. 23 did not include tax increases for Washington, D.C. residents, and instead included budget cuts for many city services.
In a press release, D.C. Councilman Jack Evans reiterated the importance of preventing overtaxation of District residents.
“The mayor-elect is very aware of the tax burden faced by our residents and small businesses, and [he] recognizes that we cannot balance the budget on their backs,” Evans said.
According to the DCist website, the proposed budget calls for a revenue increase of $27.4 million through the consolidation of several accounts into the city’s general fund.
Budget cuts in the proposal affected every office or department, including a $6 million drop in Department of Transportation services, the elimination of the Office of Planning’s Historic Homeowner Grant program and a $5.8 million slash in Department of Human Services funding.
Georgetown will also be hit by some of the cuts suggested by the proposal. The budget calls for decreasing Health Initiative Contracts with the Hilltop as well as with The George Washington University, which will save a total of $123,000.
A public hearing on the budget will take place today.
In a speech last Monday, mayor-elect Vincent Gray discussed the budget deficit and possible solutions to the gaps.
“The reality is that it could be a number of years before the District’s economy fully rebounds,” Gray said. “The District will not raise significant revenue unless we target one or more of the major tax categories. All options will have to be on the table if we’re going to fix this gap in our operating budget.”
Still, Gray made promises to only bump up taxes as a last resort.
“I know that too many District families and businesses are hurting from the recession as much as or even more than the District government,” Gray said. “So I will not ask District residents or businesses to pay one single dollar in tax increases without first assuring them that we have scrubbed the budget and found every last dollar in savings first.”
The District has a history of financial instability. In 1994, Ellen O’Connor, then the District’s chief financial officer, estimated that the city would run out of money within two years.
To combat the drain in funds, District officials worked with then-Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich to forge a plan for rescuing the area from fiscal crisis. The city’s economic situation only slightly improved following budget cuts and re-focused priorities.

Two pairs of Georgetown students will be given the chance to enhance life on the Hilltop this year, winning $3,000 each for the concepts they proposed to Reimagine Georgetown.
The Reimagine Georgetown grants, which range from $500 to $10,000, are awarded annually to students, faculty and staff members who present ideas that the committee believes would best enrich the experience of students at Georgetown.
This year two groups received grants: Kitt Wolfenden (SFS ’12) and Sammy Magnuson (COL ’12) won for Breaking the Bubble, a group that will organize trips to off-campus events. Bre Donald (NHS ’12) and Melissa Gadsden (NHS ’12), the other two winners, hope to establish a farmers market on campus with their proposal.
Wolfenden, a contributor to THE GUIDE, and Magnuson came up with the idea for their proposal on their way back from the H Street Festival this fall. According to Wolfenden, the idea fell into place soon afterward.
“It just clicked,” she said in an email. “We’ve always been passionate about exploring the city and of course, we want to make Georgetown a better place, so forming this club just seemed like a natural way for us to contribute. One of the biggest drawbacks I see at our school is the `bubble’ that most students fall victim to and hear about.”
Student coordinators will lead trips into the city, focusing on hotspots like independent record stores or restaurant tastings based on specific interests once a week. Each group will have up to 15 students, and club membership will not be required in order for students to attend. According to Wolfenden, the group gives students the opportunity to meet others with similar interests.
“Getting an education is about more than learning in a classroom, and the world outside our front gates is delicious, exciting and fun,” Wolfenden said.
Breaking the Bubble hopes to be up and running by next fall, and interested students should look for them at September’s Student Activities Commission fair.
“Getting off campus is about much more than just a fun time. It’s about engaging with our surroundings, broadening our educations, understanding the real world and getting the most we can out of our time in the District,” Wolfenden said.
Reimagine Georgetown’s other winner, The Georgetown University Farmers Market, conceived by Donald and Gadsden, aims to bring a farmers market to Healy Circle.
“Some of our main goals in this initiative [are] to improve access to healthy food on campus, improve nutritional status of Georgetown students and faculty and foster a stronger relationship with the surrounding community,” Donald said in an email.
The group hopes to bring around 10 vendors to the Hilltop, as well as hold cooking demonstrations by O’Donovan Hall chefs. The market would be open once a week, for six to seven weeks in the fall and six to seven weeks in the spring.
“Ultimately, we hope that the market becomes an integral part of Georgetown’s culture and lasts long after Melissa and I graduate,” Donald said. “The grant is particularly important for funding some of the key marketing and other labor/material costs necessary to kick off the market. Eventually, we hope to transition to making this a sustainable market.”
She and Gadsen hope to hold a test market this spring but are planning on officially kicking off the project in the fall.
Reimagine Georgetown is a student partnership co-sponsored by THE HOYA, The Corp and Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union.

Applications from minority students surged in this year’s early action admissions cycle, according to Charles Deacon, dean of undergraduate admissions.
The number of applications from black students swelled by 44.9 percent this fall, with 526 applying this year, up from 363 early applications last year. Among Asian-Americans and international students, applications rose by 11.4 percent and 29.5 percent, respectively. This year’s early cycle saw a 34.3 percent upturn in applications from certain Latino students, though complete statistics for that demographic were unavailable.
“The most dramatic [change] is the distribution by ethnicity. All of the increase has come from students of color. That is in keeping with national trends,” Deacon said. “So we’re very happy about that increase.”
Of the undergraduate schools, the School of Nursing and Health Studies saw the steepest rise in early action applicants. The number of applications went up by about 28.3 percent, from 376 applications last year to 475 this year. The McDonough School of Business also saw a large increase, about 15.5 percent, from 826 early applications last year to 954 so far this year.
According to Deacon, this jump in applications to career-oriented undergraduate schools is a result of the economic downturn and new and planned construction on campus. The economic downturn has forced students to search for a more directly applicable major, such as one in the sciences or in business, according to Deacon. The Rafik B. Hariri Building, opened in 2009, and the new science center, which is set to open in 2012, may also make those majors more appealing to prospective students, Deacon said.
“What we’re concluding from this is that students right now are tending to apply to more practical areas like nursing and health studies. Maybe business may lead to jobs. Sciences may lead to professions like medicine,” Deacon said. “So there’s a slight tendency for people to be defensive in how they’re applying, not surprisingly, given the economy the way it is.”
The College saw an increase in applications of about 8 percent, with a noticeable spike in the number of students interested in pursuing a science major. The number of applications to the Faculty of Language and Linguistics remained steady, and the Walsh School of Foreign Service saw about a 2.2 percent boost.
The current applicant pool is about the same as past years in terms of academic credentials. SAT math and critical reading combined scores have decreased from 1355 to 1350, and average class rank hovers at the 91st percentile. For this application pool, Georgetown decided to slightly change the SAT II requirements. Instead of requiring all three of the tests, the tests are now only strongly recommended. While many schools eliminated the third SAT II requirement altogether, the Georgetown admissions committee finds it valuable, especially for science and language majors, according to Deacon.
According to Deacon, the early application pool generally boasts more applications from the Northeast, but Georgetown has seen an increase of early applicants from the South, especially from states such as Florida and Georgia. Georgetown also witnessed more applicants from public schools and independent private schools and a drop in those from Jesuit and Catholic schools.
ore students are also seeking financial aid this year.
The admissions committee is currently reading applications, and will release decisions by Dec. 15. Georgetown has a policy of accepting the same percentage of early applicants as they do during the regular admissions cycle, and will look to admit about 19 percent, or about 1,100 applicants, from the early pool.
Early applications for the Class of 2015 have now risen by about 8.6 percent from last year, and will continue toward a 9 percent increase by the final tally, according to Deacon.
