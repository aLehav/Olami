A male university employee sustained serious injuries after he fell 15 feet into a ventilation shaft on top of Yates Field House while performing maintenance on Kehoe Field.
According to Rob Mathis, a spokesman for the university, the employee was transported to Washington Hospital Center after D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services and Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Services responded to the scene. Several sources are reporting that the worker sustained level-1 trauma injuries and was transported by U.S. Park Police helicopter.
The injuries were serious, but not life threatening, according to Mathis. The worker is in stable condition. The incident remains under investigation.
D.C. Fire and EMS and GERMS could not be reached for comment.
