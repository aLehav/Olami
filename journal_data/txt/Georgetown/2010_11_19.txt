The National Academy of Public Administration honored former Secretary of the Treasury and Secretary of State James Baker III and Sen. George Mitchell with the Elliot Richardson Prize for Public Excellence on Wednesday in Lohrfink Auditorium.
Presented in partnership with The Georgetown Public Policy Institute, the $100,000 prize honors individuals who share the virtues of the late Elliot Richardson, the only U.S. public servant to hold four Cabinet-level positions in the government.
In his opening remarks, John Thomas Smith II, a member of the Elliot Richardson Board of Directors, acknowledged the dedication, service and integrity that aligned Richardson’s public service career with those of Baker and Mitchell.
“[Elliot Richardson] showed an unrivaled generosity of spirit,” Smith said. “The honorees sought to perpetuate Elliot’s memory and emulate public service through courage and integrity.”
Michael Rogers, chair of the Elliot Richardson Board, presented the prizes, commending Baker for his excellence in service as secretary of state during the post-Cold War era, as secretary of the treasury under President Reagan and as White House chief of staff under both Reagan and George H. W. Bush.
“[Baker] shares an integrity which has been a hallmark of his career, a generosity of spirit and courage,” Rogers said.
Mitchell, former chairman of the Peace Negotiations in Northern Ireland and the current special envoy for the Middle East, was awarded for serving “selflessly with great distinction in all three branches of government…uncompromising excellence and courageous optimism,” Rogers said.
The discussion addressed a broad range of topics including the disconnect between the government and the public, the economic crisis, media and its influence on public opinion and examples of exemplary presidential leadership.
Baker and Mitchell also stressed the importance of understanding the political process through a public policy background.
“It’s absolutely necessary,” Baker said. “Presidents will trust people who have been through the fire with them. Political experience gives you an understanding of the process. You don’t serve the president well if you don’t tell him what you really think . and they appreciate an informed opinion.”
Mitchell agreed, adding the president in particular needs aides to provide him with empirical data.
“The higher one goes into American politics, the greater one reaches self-delusion. The president gets in a cocoon, and it’s difficult finding about what’s going on in the world,” he said. “They’re starved for genuine information.”
Audience members said that while the discussion was interesting, the primary appeal of the event was the individuals being honored. Eitan Paul (SFS ’12), chair of the International Relations Club, said he relished the chance to see the two policymakers discuss the current state of the nation.
“The focus was definitely on their interaction with decision-makers,” Paul said. “It was nice getting a window into their perspective on their service and where the country is going.”
Janice Shon (SFS ’11) also admired the men for their extensive and far-reaching public service careers. “These are people who dedicated their lives for it. I wanted to know their motivations and how they were able to have such a wide breadth of public service capacities,” she said.
Christopher Joyner, a professor and director of the Master’s Program in International Law, even used the occasion as a field trip opportunity for his Globalization and International Law students.
“To me the substance was not as important as the reflection of the two men who were present for policy-making in the Senate and international diplomacy,” Joyner said. “I was hoping they would see two important historical figures of the late 20th century.”
The honorees plan to donate their award money to further the study of public service. Baker will contribute to the Baker Institute of Public Policy at Rice University and Mitchell to the Mitchell Institute scholarship program.
At the end of the evening, Mitchell told the crowd of public policy students that service was always his ultimate goal.
“You will want fame and status, but the more of them you’ll get the more you’ll realize that they don’t mean anything. A genuine meaning, a goal to which you can devote yourself – it will come through in public service. It’s the most rewarding thing in life.”

Smithsonian museum regulars might need to start dipping into their pockets soon if a new budget proposal is passed. President Obama’s deficit reduction commission proposed admissions fees at the Smithsonian museums last week in order to reduce congressional spending. The suggested $7.50 per visitor would decrease congressional spending by $225 million.
The Smithsonian museum system, which includes the National Art Gallery and the American History Museum, has been free to the public since 1846. According to Smithsonian officials, the free entry policy allows people to come visit regardless of their economic situation.
“In a sense, Americans already pay to visit the Smithsonian with their tax dollars, which provide about two-thirds of the Smithsonian’s annual budget. Because there is no admission fee, people are able to see their national treasures, participate in educational programs and visit exhibitions regardless of their ability to pay,” Smithsonian officials said in a news release in response to the suggested budget changes Nov. 12.
According to Sheila Burke, former deputy secretary and chief operating officer of the Smithsonian Institution, the laws by which the National American Indian Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden were created forbid admission fees. The Freer Gallery of Art is also required to remain free of charge, as stipulated in Charles Lang Freer’s will.
The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform based its calculations of savings and suggested fees on the reported 30 million patrons who visit Smithsonian museums annually. However, the Smithsonian Institution argues that it is instead 30 million visits, not individual visitors, that the museums receive each year.
According to Smithsonian officials, the report by the National Commission also failed to consider the potential decrease in visitors that the Smithsonian could face if museum fees were implemented.
“[Admission fees] would not only deprive many families of the benefit they have earned with their tax dollars, but would also have a negative impact on the business income earned in the Smithsonian’s museum shops, restaurants and theaters,” the Smithsonian Institute said.
Suggestions similar to commission proposal have been presented at congressional hearings in the past, but none have received the support of the public or the Smithsonian Board of Regents.
Many members of Congress have also voiced opposition it the past. In 2008, Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) announced that he would fight “tooth and nail” against all proposed Smithsonian admission fees.
“I don’t think we want to do that to Americans because what we possess is not only fabulous but hallowed,” he told The Washington Post. “Anyone who wants to charge, you have to walk through me.”

Georgetown may not have found its own Iron Chef, but it did foster a new generation of entrepreneurs Thursday with a culinary-themed competition held by the McDonough School of Business.
Students from the MSB’s new first-year seminar, a semester-long program that introduces freshmen to creative entrepreneurship and social responsibility, were divided into teams of four or five. They were then tasked with finding the most effective way in which DC Central Kitchen, a nonprofit group, can use local food to prepare meals for nearby homeless shelters and soup kitchens.
The winning business strategy, called Fresh Fields, proposed the sale of affordable organic food prepared at the kitchen in Metro-area grocery stores. Taking second place, The Concept of Pie was a venture into the gourmet pie business.
Patricia Louison, MSB senior assistant dean for undergraduate programs and co-director of the first-year seminar, said she was thrilled with the students’ work.
“It’s great to see what they’re able to do with an idea – a charge to help DC Central Kitchen,” she said. “If you did not know this was the first-year seminar, you wouldn’t have known that these were students new to Georgetown and new to the study of business.”
“It was a really valuable experience, because it taught me the lesson that there is a lot of thought that goes into a business – how to start it, how to manage your financials. It’s just different from the original business course,” Colleen Fitzgerald (MSB ’14), a member of the seminar, said.
Eunice Chin (MSB ’14), a member of Fresh Fields, said that she was pleased with how well the team performed.
“It’s amazing that we’ve started from knowing nothing about this, and now we’ve won,” she said. “Honestly, this whole concept is new to us.”
Conor McNulty (MSB ’14), whose team developed a bid for the contract to feed the inmates at D.C.’s Central Detention Facility, said the project
surprised him.
“I found it very engaging and hands-on. I had to practice skills, like calling up the chief executive officer of D.C.’s Department of Corrections,” he said.
The first-year seminar program includes a class called “International Business, Public Policy and Society,” and a lecture series, as a well as the business plan competition. Nearly 100 students – one-third of the MSB’s freshman class – are included in the program.
While it may have taught the participants concrete business skills, Norean Sharpe, MSB associate dean for undergraduate programs, said the competition also had a more humanitarian objective.
“We’re trying to instill that it’s not all about making money,” she said.

A laptop was stolen in an unforced burglary in Darnall Hall Wednesday afternoon, according to a Public Safety Alert sent to the campus community Thursday evening.
The Darnall resident took a nap at 2:30 p.m., leaving the door unlocked. When he woke up at 4:20 p.m., his laptop had been stolen. There were no signs of forced entry and the victim was not injured.
This incident is the latest in a string of laptop thefts on campus this semester. In November, 17 laptops have been reported stolen to the Department of Public Safety this month. After a series of burglaries and laptop thefts in Village A in late October, DPS instituted new security measures such as improved lighting and increased patrols in the area.
Several laptops have been stolen in Lauinger Library, including two on Wednesday. DPS does not normally send out PSAs regarding laptop thefts, however. This incident warranted a PSA because it was a burglary, according to DPS Investigative Sgt. David Ruiz.
“This crime poses a significant threat to the immediate community and we want students to be aware of their surroundings,” Ruiz said.
It is unclear whether the thefts are linked, according to Ruiz. DPS is investigating the incident.

At $911, 613, University President John J. DeGioia’s earnings in the 2008-2009 fiscal year stack up short of 30-plus university executives making more than $1 million during that time, according to a new survey.
DeGioia’s salary that year was $269,000 more than his salary the previous year, according to Internal Revenue Service tax filings. The president’s most recent salary available on public record is almost double what he received for the 2001-2002 fiscal year, his second full year as Georgetown’s president.
According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, which released the survey results, the upward movement in college presidents’ salaries is a national trend.
More than 30 executives of private colleges made at least $1 million last year. The presidents of New York University and Clark-Atlanta University both made over a million dollars in base pay. DeGioia’s compensation places him second in D.C., behind The George Washington University President Steven Knapp, who was paid $985,353.
According to university spokeswoman Julie Bataille, the board of directors said that DeGioia’s salary is consistent with the pressures placed on him as Georgetown’s top official.
“The board of directors believes that President DeGioia’s salary and compensation package are commensurate with his performance and the demands of leading a highly selective, global research university,” Bataille wrote in an email.
DeGioia’s salary was comprised of $543,888 in base pay and $367,725 in additional compensation and benefits. The additional pay included reserves for a retirement annuity and funds that paid for DeGioia’s university-provided housing.
In January 2009, DeGioia announced an 18-month freeze on his and all university vice presidents’ pay. The post-freeze status of DeGioia’s salary is not yet available.
Though DeGioia’s salary pushed the $1 million mark, it was significantly lower than presidents’ salaries at comparable universities.
Nicholas Zeppos, chancellor of Vanderbilt University, made $2,407,588 last year, making him the highest-paid president of a research institution for fiscal year 08-09. The presidents of Yale and the University of Pennsylvania made $1,530,008 and $1,367,004, respectively. Harvard University’s president was among those who made less than DeGioia, with $822,011 in yearly earnings.
According to The Chronicle, the overall increase in university executives’ pay has not resulted in tuition increases, since the salary represents such a small portion of university budgets.
Still, many students feel that DeGioia’s high salary does not make sense considering Georgetown’s tuition cost.
“It does seem a little outlandish,” Arturo Altamirano (COL ’14) said. “Tuition is [over] $50,000 a year [including fees and room and board], so it’s essentially like 18 students are paying their tuition to be the yearly salary of President DeGioia. . It’s a weird concept.”
Sam Fox (COL ’14) said that DeGioia’s salary could be too lofty in light of university finances.
“Especially given the university’s money problems, and the difficulties funding the science building, if that has been a problem, then the fact that [DeGioia] is getting paid almost a million dollars to do his job seems excessive,” Fox said.
Some students felt that DeGioia’s compensation was fair considering the competitive market for university executives, however.
“If the president’s salary is similar to that of other college presidents, then I think it’s fair,” Annalise Dragic (SFS ’14) said. “I think that the university should allocate an appropriate salary given President DeGioia’s contribution to the school.”

The Law Center continued to draw attention to the federal “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy by holding a panel series supporting the policy’s repeal on Wednesday.
The event, “The Future of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” follows a memo issued by Law Center Dean William Treanor in September in which he slammed the controversial measure, which prohibits gays from serving openly in the military.
In their discussion at the Law Center’s McDonough Hall, panelists addressed the legislative, judicial and administrative measures necessary for a smooth transition into a policy that would allow gay military personnel to serve openly. DADT could be scrapped by this year’s lame-duck session of Congress, pending the December release of an internal Pentagon review of the risks associated with ending DADT.
Panelists in the first discussion session about the administrative approach included law professors Diane Mazur and Jackie Gardina, as well as Aaron Tax, legal director for the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network. They discussed the need for strong leadership in the event of a policy shift and debated the issue of
military control, questioning who has the power to alter military policies.
“We need to have a watchdog approach,” Gardina said, citing the possibility of future executives refusing to enforce DADT.
Gardina explained that supporters of the repeal needed to be wary of future presidents that may be less inclined to allow gays to serve in the military.
The second panel, “The Judicial Branch,” included Daniel J. Woods, who was the lead attorney for Log Cabin Republicans v. United States. Panelist Aaron H. Caplan held the same position in Witt v. Department of the Air Force, while panelist Seth Galanter was the attorney for Air Force Lt. Col. Victor Fehrenbach, who was accused and later cleared of charges of sexually assaulting a male service member.
The Log Cabin Republicans v. United States case, filed in 2004, challenged the constitutionality of DADT. The trial began in July, and in September the District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that DADT violated the First and Fifth Amendments. In October, the District court ordered the military to stop enforcing the law – that is, to stop all discharges and hire openly gay enlistees.
The federal government appealed this ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, leading to a stay of execution on the District Court’s injunction on DADT.
“The plaintiffs asked the Supreme Court to vacate the 2-1 decision to keep the stay in place,” earlier this month, according to the panel’s press release. The Supreme Court denied the request.
The final panel, “The Legislative Path,” featured representatives from organizations that supported the repeal of DADT, including the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, the Military Equality Alliance and the Human Rights Campaign. Panelists discussed the status of the DADT repeal in Congress, as well as the Department of Defense report, due Dec. 1, on how the repeal of DADT would be implemented.
Copies of the Pentagon findings have been leaked, and these reports indicate that the Pentagon finds “only minimal and isolated incidents of risk to the current war efforts,” according to The Washington Post.
President Obama spoke about repealing the ban on LGBT service members during his campaign and inaugural presidential address in 2008, but many panelists called the president’s approach to the proposed repeal light-handed.

Georgetown’s website is getting a facelift as the university plans to premiere its newly reconstructed page on Dec. 3. The new site – the first redesign since 2002 – is currently available to students in a beta format at beta.georgetown.edu.
The aesthetic elements of the website were substantially changed, according to university spokeswoman Julie Bataille. Extensive improvements were made to the “top tier” – the homepage and anything two or three clicks away from it – and the site also incorporates new multimedia content, including a video section.
According to Mohammed El-Khatib (GRD ’11), who helped program the new site, the redesign also made the site more navigable, incorporating a special navigation bar that can be recalled and dismissed to save room on the screen.
“The new site navigation system is impressive in its intuitive interface and ease of use. Users will be able to access all of the crucial shortcuts depending on where they are on the website,” El-Khatib said in an email.
The idea to revamp the university’s website was first introduced during discussions between the board of directors and stakeholders. The Office of Communications was tasked with determining the content and web design, which it molded using input from current and prospective students, faculty and alumni. The university then hired Happy Cog, a web design firm, to aid in the research and design alongside University Information Services personnel. The entire process was recorded on the Office of Communications Website Redesign Blog.
Although the redesign has only affected a portion of the main website, Bataille expects that the separate undergraduate schools will soon make improvements to their respective sites as well.
“Now we have much more flexible tools to help other schools to revamp their websites,” she said.
The website’s renovation is the latest way in which the university is addressing its evolving relationship with the Internet. Georgetown introduced an interactive map page last month, and the university already has an active Facebook page and Twitter account.
Last week, the Office of Communications launched an official Georgetown University YouTube channel, which features videos about campus and academic life.
According to Evan Smith (SFS ’14), the restructured website and YouTube channel are much needed renovations to what he considers to be Georgetown’s sub-par Internet presence.
“It’s pretty appalling that a major research university has such an anachronistic website. The new website is like moving from a horse and buggy to a BMW,” Smith said.
For Jenny Brown (COL ’13), the redesign simply makes navigation easier for students.
“My biggest problem with the old website was how hard it was to find the academic calendar, and that’s really easy now,” Brown said.
According to Bataille, reforming Georgetown’s website was integral in presenting the school in the best possible light.
“The web is how prospective students find information about the university first, before they even come to us,” Bataille said. “It is important that we have a web presence that is up to par with who we are, our identity, the caliber of our school and community.”

Less than a month after the Four Loko frenzy hit college campuses nationwide, the Food and Drug Administration has cracked down on beverages that combine alcohol and caffeine – and students are taking measures to stockpile the popular drink.
“We are all sold out,” Chris Lee, a manager at Wagner’s Liquor on Wisconsin Avenue, said. “The distributor has stopped sales, so whoever has it in D.C., that’s it.”
On Wednesday, the FDA sent letters to four companies – including Four Loko’s manufacturer, Phusion Projects – warning them that caffeine added to malt beverages is an “unsafe food additive,” according to an FDA press release. In response, students have gone on a buying spree at liquor stores around the area hoping to store up some of the quickly disappearing product.
“All my friends were mentioning and calling me up and we were all like we got to stock up on it before it goes. Keep the party going,” John Oriolo (MSB’11) said. “I was thinking about [stocking up] but I don’t want to be the person who goes in and gets like 90 Four Lokos.”
Questions remain as to the effectiveness of the ban in some students’ minds, however.
“I don’t know if a ban is the best way to stop people from drinking,” Jack Glascott (COL’12) said. “If people want to do something particularly unhealthy they’re going to find a way to do it. If something is banned it just makes people want it that much more because they can’t have it.”
Anam Raheem (COL ’11) agreed. “College kids were able to go out and black out before Four Loko, and they still will after Four Loko.”
But medical professionals see benefits from the ban, even if it will not completely stop dangerous alcohol consumption.
“It is educating people about the risks of combining energy drinks and alcohol,” Dr. Kirsten Hawkins, chief of adolescent medicine at Georgetown University Hospital, said. “It’s not going to stop them, but hopefully it will decrease it.”
The crackdown comes after pressure from lawmakers such as Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.). In a press release, Schumer applauded the FDA’s decision to limit access to the “deadly brew.”
Criticism of the drink has already caused states such as Michigan and New York to ban Four Loko after incidents involving the drink on college campuses left students hospitalized. There was no legislation banning the product in the District under consideration before the FDA’s announcement, according to Jordan Hutchinson, committee clerk for the D.C. Council Committee on Health. Hawkins emphasized that Four Loko is dangerous despite some students’ lack of concern.
“People don’t realize the amount of alcohol in the drink,” Hawkins said. “One can is considered binge drinking.”
She said Four Loko-type drinks encourage people to start drinking younger.
“It is marketed to teens and young adults,” she said. “We know the rates of binge drinking are higher for those age groups.”
Tessa Telly, social norms coordinator at the Student Health Center, is in favor of the decision.
“I totally support the FDA’s ban. If there is a track record of the drinks being harmful, and possibly being fatal, then something needs to be done about it,” Telly said in an email.
Much of her concern rests with the masking affects of alcohol combined with caffeine.
“We tell students to `let friends know when they’ve had enough’ and `keep track of how many drinks you are consuming.’ How do you follow these tips when the feeling you get from the caffeine is telling you `you’re fine,’ when you’ve actually had too much to drink?”
Opponents of the ban, however, do not see a difference between drinking a Four Loko and consuming Red Bull mixed with vodka or other common caffeine-alcohol mixes.
Phusion Projects announced on Tuesday that it will be removing caffeine from its offerings in anticipation of the FDA’s recommendation.
“We have repeatedly contended – and still believe, as do many people throughout the country – that the combination of alcohol and caffeine is safe. We are taking this step after trying – unsuccessfully – to navigate a difficult and politically charged regulatory environment at both the state and federal levels,” the company’s co-founders said in a statement.
Hawkins said the distinction is awareness. Consumers know how much they are drinking when they independently mix alcohol and energy drinks.
“They obviously know what they are doing,” she said.
Some students ultimately feel it is the individual’s, not the government’s, responsibility to curb irresponsible drinking.
“My thought is that if people can’t be responsible with it what are you going to do, you can’t ban everything, so where do you draw the line,” Oriolo said.
