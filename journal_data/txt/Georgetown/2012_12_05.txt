Liquor stores in the District of Columbia will now be open on Sunday.
The D.C. Council approved the measure earlier today, revoking Blue Laws that mandated that liquor stores be closed on Sundays.
The new legislation also permits licenses for the creation of wine pubs and the sale of 64 ounce beer growlers, which are glass jugs containing alcohol.
The law will go into effect sometime next year.
