	School of Foreign Service Dean Carol Lancaster has been diagnosed with a brain tumor and will be away from campus in the coming weeks to seek treatment, according to a campus-wide email sent from the Office of the President on Tuesday night.  
	Senior Associate Dean James Reardon-Anderson will step up as acting dean and will be aided on faculty affairs by Jeff Anderson, chair of the SFS faculty.
	Lancaster has been dean of the SFS since 2010 and served as interim dean for one year before assuming the position. She graduated from the SFS in 1964. 
	In his email, DeGioia extended his thoughts and prayers for Lancaster’s speedy recovery. Students who wish to send Lancaster well wishes can email or send letters to the SFS Dean’s Office in Intercultural Center 301.

	To complement the School of Foreign Service’s economics and government-heavy course load, the SFS Academic Council will propose an arts and politics undergraduate certificate in December.	The council is currently preparing a proposal for the SFS Curriculum Committee. The tentative details of the certificate include three theoretical classes based on the intersection of international relations and fine arts, as well as three classes focused on a discipline in fine arts, such as music theory, art history or dance. The certificate would conclude with a capstone presentation where seniors would perform or present their work in fine arts.	Jinyoung Lee (SFS ’15), an SFS Academic Council junior representative, hopes the certificate would allow SFS students to experience an often forgotten aspect of international relations.	“Fine arts and IR theory have a really interesting relationship, and I think there needs to be more emphasis of this aspect of international relations,” Lee said, “I think the SFS puts you in such a professional mindset it’s especially hard to explore different subjects.”	Lee said that the idea of the certificate has sparked some interest among the SFS administration and students.	“I would say in principle, the study of the arts, and their role in international affairs fits quite nicely within the mission of the School of Foreign Service,” SFS Senior Associate Dean James Reardon-Anderson said. “One could imagine a lot of interesting topics in international affairs, but we have to make sure that we can actually deliver the courses and the expertise.”	The SFS Academic Council is coordinating with the SFS administration and the Department of Performing Arts and Department of Art and Art History to try to add the certificate to the SFS curriculum. The program incorporates courses that already exist and could potentially add new courses. Working with some local museums and institutions is also under consideration.	“A certificate like this would definitely allow to me to tailor my focus,” Mesbah Uddin (SFS ’15), an aspiring filmmaker, said. “I’m surprised this doesn’t exist already when the relation between arts and IR is so predominant.”

	Twitter users around the globe promoted awareness of the rising levels of sectarian violence in the Central African Republic during an inaugural Twitter discussion hosted by the Georgetown Conflict Resolution Program on Nov. 20.	“A goal of ours was to get more people involved to learn about the CAR. [For] most people, it’s not really on their radar,” Conflict Resolution program member Briana Mawby (GRD ’15) said.	Participants were invited to follow @TheProjectCAR and tweet questions with the accompanying hashtag #CARaware. The program convened a panel of experts to answer questions on displacement, regional effects, village security and child soldiers.	John Rudolph Beaton, manager of the Lord’s Resistance Army Crisis Tracker, Mike Jobbins, Search for Common Ground Senior Program Manager, Resolve Director of Policy Paul Ronan and Louisa Lombard, Ciriacy-Wantrup Postdoctoral Fellow in Natural Resource Economics in geography department at the University of California at Berkeley all shared their opinions.	“There’s not much news coming out of [the] CAR, but there is a huge amount of violence coming out right now,” Mawby said.	The primary groups involved in the conflict in the CAR are the African Union, the Anti-Balaka, the Seleka and the LRA. Both the Seleka and the LRA use child soldiers in their armies. The Seleka, a largely Muslim group, has been fighting the Christian Anti-Balaka group on and off for decades.	“Christians and Muslims have largely lived together peacefully. #armedgroups incited violence,” Beaton tweeted, using a hashtag to enumerate the prevelance of armed groups in the CAR.	Violence in the CAR is often carried out by groups reinforced with child soldiers, and according to the United Nations Children’s Fund, there are more than 3,000 child soldiers in the CAR alone, and over 300,000 worldwide.	“Child soldier recruitment is inseparable from insecurity in general,” Jobbins tweeted.	The massacres carried out by child soldiers as well as bands of armed groups in the Central African Republic are on the verge of genocidal levels, as sectarian violence steadily increases with little hope for a broader peace. To combat the rise in violence, France is advocating for the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers to the CAR in support of the African Union forces.	In response to the killings, some villages have created their own militias; however, some of these groups have been known to incite violence as well.	The discussion attracted an international pool of participants, including residents of America, France and the CAR.	“I think it [the discussion] was quite successful, and not just raising issues, but also engaging people from actually all over the world,” program member Giorgia Nicatore said (GRD ’15).	Jean-Baptiste Koba, president of the Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa in the CAR, joined the discussion and expressed his appreciation that they were spreading international awareness about the CAR.	“We were really surprised by the huge amount of people and the different groups of people that participated,” Mawby said. “I thought it was an interesting way to look at social media as well as educating people and bringing an academic discussion to a broader audience.”

The Georgetown University Student Association senate passed a resolution to endorse GU Fossil Free’s proposal to mandate the university’s divestment from fossil fuels Sunday evening.
The bill passed with 17 votes to six, and GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) signed the bill Monday evening.
“I think that [the bill] lends support to what Fossil Free is going for, so now when they go and they have meetings with administrators, it’s with kind of the backing of GUSA,” Tisa said.
Ten members of GU Fossil Free attended the senate meeting and spoke about several aspects of the resolution, which was introduced by the GUSA Student Life Committee, before the floor was opened to questions and debate, primarily centered on practicality and the resolution’s effect on the university’s endowment.
Supporters of the resolution asserted that divesting would minimally impact the university’s endowment and maintain its message of social responsibility.
“One of the studies by [TheEnergyCollective.com] showed that those fund managers that divested and then reinvested in renewable energy actually cut their financial risk,” Fossil Free member Annie Wang (COL ’16) said.
Critics of the bill contended that the endowment is not a suitable financial tool for divestment.
“The endowment is primarily a financial tool used to sustain scholarships, development, initiatives on campus and research,” Senate Vice Speaker Sam Greco (SFS ’15) said. Greco added that Georgetown’s relatively low endowment would make divestment even more problematic, but others disagreed lauding the bill’s history and outside support as a sign of legitimacy.
“This isn’t something that was put together just by a bunch of students,” Student Life Committee Chairman Ben Weiss (COL ’15) said. “This is something that people who know what they’re doing and are aware of how endowments work and how funds and investments work, sat down with a group of very inspired individuals and put this proposal together.”
GU Fossil Free hopes to receive a formal endorsement of the resolution from Georgetown’s Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility and meet with administrators in the coming spring semester. GU Fossil Free is also planning to hold events with subject matter experts in order to cultivate financially responsible methods for divestment.GU Fossil Free members considered the bill a success and the ensuing discussion heartening.
“The amount of discourse was really encouraging because that’s what our proposal is trying to do, is promote discourse about the subject, even between both sides,” GU Fossil Free co-founder Sydney Browning (SFS ’15) said.
Supporters believe that the bill will establish a clear position in regard to the university’s outlook on social responsibility.
“It is a statement that we’re making that says Georgetown has this opinion and sees the world in this way,” Senator Jonathan Thrall (SFS ’17) said.

	Egyptian Ramy Jan was scheduled to appear at a Dec. 5 event at Georgetown University until it was discovered he was the leader of the fledgling Egyptian Nazi Party and was promptly disinvited.
	The event, “Egypt and the Struggle for Democracy,” was to be hosted by Georgetown’s Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding and has since been postponed until late January.
	Jan is a founding member of Egypt’s Nazi Party, a small and insignificant group in Egyptian politics, The New York Times reported. However, the views he espouses are extreme. He appeared on Dream1 TV in Egypt in September 2011 and stated in remarks translated by The Middle East Media Research Institute that he does not recognize the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel and that the Egyptian Nazi party has aims to build a nuclear reactor.
	 “Our political goal is to make the Arab race, or Arabic speakers, the best race,” Head of the Egyptian Nazi Party Muhi Al-Din Gamal said in the video. This opinion stands in direct conflict with the ACMCU’s mission, posted on its website, which is “to improve relations between the Muslim world and the West.”
	Georgetown originally invited Jan as a representative of Christians Against the Coup, which did not support the military ouster of then-president Hosni Mubarak.
	Founding director of the center, professor John Esposito, declined The Hoya’s request for comment. However, in an article on The New York Times‘ website, he said that the organizers had not known about Jan’s views.
	“This was new to us that he had a background like that and as soon as it came to our attention he was immediately disinvited,” Esposito said. “We had no idea that there was this issue out there.”
 ACMCU Associate Director Kristine Kidwell also said that the center did not know about Jan’s position in the Egyptian Nazi Party.
 “Ramy Jan is absolutely not coming to speak at Georgetown University at any point,” she wrote in an email. “No one involved in the creation of this event had any idea whatsoever about Jan’s questionable affiliations. He is no longer invited to speak at Georgetown, and we are amending our conference speakers and schedule.”
	The event’s original page on ACMCU’s website has been taken down, and the new page features a bold announcement at the top.
	“Due to lengthy delays with our Egyptian participants getting visas, the Dec. 5 Conference has been postponed to Jan 30, 2014, to enable their participation,” the notice on the new page read and has since been taken down altogether.
	The conference will feature Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), the first Muslim member elected to Congress, who will give the keynote address, and Dr. Wael Haddara, former adviser to deposed Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi.
	Other speakers include professors from American University in Cairo, The George Washington University and the University of Toronto, as well as various scholars and journalists.

	National Security Advisor Susan Rice discussed the future of the Asia-Pacific and announced in Gaston Hall on Wednesday that President Barack Obama would visit the region in April.	Obama’s scheduled trip in October was canceled due to the government shutdown.	“Rebalancing toward the Asia-Pacific remains a cornerstone of the Obama administration’s foreign policy. No matter how many hot spots emerge elsewhere, we will continue to deepen our enduring commitment to this critical region,” Rice said. “Our friends in Asia deserve and will continue to get our highest level of attention.”	Rice laid out the Obama administration’s plan for the next three years.	“Ultimately, America’s purpose is to establish a more stable security environment in Asia, an open and transparent economic environment and a liberal political environment that will respect the universal rights and freedoms of all,” she said.	Rice said Obama would focus on four areas to build growth in Asia: enhancing security, expanding prosperity, fostering democratic values and advancing human dignity.	“Our military presence in the region is vital,” Rice said. “Not only to deter threats and defend allies, but also to provide speedy humanitarian assistance and unmatched disaster response.”	Rice specifically addressed China in terms of security and asserted that the United States remains committed to improving its military relationship with the nation.	“When it comes to China, we seek to operationalize a new model of major power relations,” she said. “That means managing inevitable competition while forging deeper cooperation on issues where our interests converge in Asia and beyond.”	Rice, who previously served as ambassador to the United Nations, related her experience on the UN Security Council to future work with China.	“I sat on the Security Council of the United Nations with China for over 4 and a half years working on many of these issues,” she said. “I know all too well that we have some fundamental differences that cannot be minimized. But I also know that our interests on many of the major challenges of our time can and should be more closely aligned.”	Specifically, Rice said the United States and China should work together to rollback the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction programs.	“We are prepared for negotiations provided they are authentic and credible, get at the entirety of North Korea’s nuclear program and result in concrete and irreversible steps toward denuclearization,” she said.	Rice also discussed the economic outlook for the region in the years ahead, citing that about a quarter of U.S. exports go to Asia.	“By the end of 2016, we aim to transform our economic relations with the region, through dramatically increased U.S. exports, the implementation of the most ambitious American free trade agreement in decades and closer cooperation with China, India and other emerging economies in pursuit of sustained global growth,” Rice said. “As an Asian-Pacific nation, the United States is working to shape a more dynamic future for entire region by promoting U.S. business and forging new ties for commerce.”	The most crucial economic policy, according to Rice, is the Trans-Pacific Partnership economic agreement.	“The rules we establish though this agreement will set standard for future trade agreements,” Rice said, citing workers rights, environmental protections and intellectual property, among others.	Rice said that the United States needs to improve its economic relationship with China, saying a poor relationship is detrimental to each nation.	“If meaningful action is not taken now, this behavior will undermine the economic relationship that benefits both our nations,” she said.	As for women in politics, Rice said decreasing the gender gap remains key to fostering economic growth.	“This single change has the potential to do the most good for the greatest number of people,” she said. “Those two factors are closely correlated – simply put, the smaller the gender gap, the stronger the economic growth.”	Rice concluded by addressing the United States’ response to Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.	“We are working around the clock to help Filipino people begin rebuilding the country. Recovery will be a long process, but the U.S. will stand beside the Philippines every step of the way,” she said.	Audience members were impressed and optimistic about what Rice said for the Asian region moving forward.	“I was especially interested with how Rice addressed increasing the participation of women in the workforce in Asia,” Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said. “Especially after the Hilary Clinton talk last week, I found the emphasis on the advancement of women in Asia to be very interesting.”

	The School of Nursing & Health Studies approved part-time status for the spring semester Thursday for all 26 students who applied for it, two weeks after denying that request to the majority of applicants.	“After careful review of those petitions, some were granted, and some were not,” NHS Assistant Dean for Enrollment Management Marianne Lyons wrote in an email to The Hoya on Nov. 13. “We carefully evaluate those requests and typically grant them for compelling reasons, such as a medical situation, family issues and a desire to perform, in keeping with Georgetown’s Catholic, Jesuit values, community service.”	Students who were initially denied part-time status said that administrators originally portrayed the petition process as less rigorous than they did after the denial.	“They gave us a piece of paper, and what I was told when they gave us the petition was, ‘Don’t worry, this is just a technicality, we rarely reject people,’ so I filled out the petition and turned it in on the day it was due, then come to find out on Monday night that I got an email that my petition had been denied,” Claire Murphy (NHS ’14) said last week.	Dean of the NHS Martin Iguchi reversed the school’s earlier decision Thursday.	“We have received feedback from faculty, staff and students about our part-time petition procedures. Given that feedback, I decided to grant all of their requests for part-time status,” Iguchi wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We ultimately felt that this was the fair approach for our student body given that some had expressed confusion over our policy.”	Amy Spohr (NHS ’14) was disappointed in the failure of communication between students and administrators.	“I was very frustrated with the administration because it seemed like there was this crazy miscommunication,” Spohr said. “We were all told by our advisor that they don’t deny anybody, and then we got an email from someone else saying we were all denied, so that just seemed really mishandled, and very unprofessional, in a way, to be told something and then receive the complete opposite information.”	When students denied part-time status initially met with administrators and faculty to voice their concerns, they were informed that part-time status was granted only due to health or family issues, according to Lyons. Despite these claims, some NHS students expressed frustration over the seemingly arbitrary nature of the process.	“They made it clear that only if you had a health issue or a serious family issue would you be granted it, except, our major is not that big, and we all talk, and I knew at least five people off the top of my head who gave the same reason that I did, but were granted it, so there was really no rhyme or reason,” Meredith Horton (NHS ’14) said.	Now that all 26 part-time status requests have been granted, students who planned research, internships and finances around receiving part-time status in the coming semester expressed relief.	“It actually is a huge thing for all of us, because it’s the money, it’s the time, it’s other things that we wanted to do,” Murphy said. “I think everybody is happy to have that now.”	In the future, NHS administrators hope to establish a clear policy for granting part-time student petitions. Potential policy includes communicating standards for part-time status approval and the possible creation of a fifth-year master’s option to better engage seniors.	Seniors in the College, who have completed a minimum of 60 credits on Main Campus, are eligible for part time status. The College Undergraduate Bulletin does not specify any additional requirements.	“We ultimately felt that this was the fair approach for our student body given that some had expressed confusion over our policy. Going forward, we will be revisiting this policy and adding clarity around it to avoid this confusion,” Dean of the NHS Martin Iguchi wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are having preliminary conversations about this possibility, and speaking with colleagues across campus to try to develop a uniformity around how we all handle part-time petitions.”	Although students expressed frustration and anger toward the NHS throughout the petition process, they are grateful for the acceptance of all part-time petitions.	“I love my major, and I love the NHS, like every second of it, so for my experience with them to end on such a bad note was really disheartening for me, but now that it seems like the faculty even fought for us, and our voices were heard, it’s definitely raised my opinion,” Spohr said. “I hope that I’ll graduate with the same sort of passion with the NHS that I started with.”

	As the D.C. mayoral race heats up, Students for a Better D.C. is working to ensure that candidates keep universities’ interests in mind.	The newly founded student organization is reaching out to mayoral candidates with policy ideas that would benefit students and the wider D.C. population.	“D.C. is right in the middle of the election process. Everything is kind of fluid, everything is kind of in transition,” member Sarah Rabon (COL ’16) said. “Since it is going to be transitioning to a new direction, depending on who is elected, we wanted to branch out to all the people who could potentially be leaders of D.C. in the near future.”	The group is pushing for a more precise noise ordinance than the Disorderly Conduct Amendment Act of 2010. According to the law, unreasonably loud noise is prohibited between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. if it disturbs other residents, although a decibel restriction is not specified. The group also plans to advocate for a higher education mayoral advisory board that would provide students with a direct channel to the mayor.	“It would be basically a panel of students who the mayor could consult with if he wanted to know how a young person would view an issue or if there was an issue that a community member wanted and he wanted to know how a young person would feel about that issue, it would be a board that he could consult,” member and Georgetown University Student Association Deputy Chief of Staff Alyssa Peterson (COL ’14) said.	Member Olivia Hinerfield (SFS ’17), however, questioned whether candidates would implement student-created policies.	“So far, they have all been very receptive, but one of the hardest parts about it is that the majority of Georgetown students are not registered to vote in D.C., and so while they are representing us as mayor, we are not going to help them get elected,” Hinerfield said.	Nevertheless, Peterson stressed that students are a vital resource for the District that is severely underutilized.	“Students and young people are a really great resource in terms of our time,” Peterson said. “Even though we tend to not have as much money, but in terms of our time to volunteer and our voting, we can be really powerful in D.C.”	Students for a Better D.C. follows in the footsteps of force student advocacy group D.C. Students Speak, which was founded in 2009. According to Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15), former DCSS Georgetown chair and current Students for D.C. member, DCSS was primarily formed to represent student voices in the formation of campus plan agreements at local universities, primarily American University, The George Washington University and Georgetown. Tezel said that the organization has largely disassembled and many members have since graduated, although representatives from each school meet approximately once a month to discuss student issues.	“They are pretty similar, and they’re going to the same goals, but I think the battlefield has changed a bit,” Tezel said about DCSS and Students for a Better D.C. “The issues are a bit different.”	Peterson said that the two organizations’ aims were different.	“They have different priorities,” Peterson said. “Students for a D.C. has a larger mission that encompasses students as well as the District. D.C. Students speak was more of a reactionary group less about concrete policy and more about protesting what they saw as intrusions on student rights.”	Both Peterson and Hinerfield vote in D.C., and they countered conventional wisdom that discounts students as a significant voting bloc.	“Students can contribute because, first of all, there are those groups of students that do vote,” Peterson said. “There are a sizable amount of students that do vote in D.C., so I don’t want it to seem like none of us are voting.”	Rabon pointed to the success Students for a Better D.C. has had in arranging meetings with mayoral candidates as indication of a willingness to hear student ideas. For example, members of the group are meeting with mayoral candidate and Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) on Thursday. To Rabon, the more pertinent issue is the lack of student involvement.	“It also feels like something I wish more students would get involved in because I think that there is room for students to have more of a voice. Students are just not trying to have as much of a voice as they could,” Rabon said. “I think part of it is definitely students don’t realize how willing leaders are to listen to student voices.”	Member Bethan Saunders (SFS ’17) attributed this attitude to Georgetown students’ fixation on national and international issues.	“Here at Georgetown, we often get caught up in the international community, and there is a very international outlook here at Georgetown, and sometimes that international outlook inhibits us to realizing how much influence we have, especially as Georgetown students, in our local community,” Saunders said, “The changes we are making may not have a huge effect on us while we are in the city, [but they] can make D.C. a better place for the people who will follow after us living in D.C. and going to Georgetown.”	Overall, Hinerfield said that the organization aims to hold candidates and elected officials responsible for their campaign promises through a coalition of D.C. student groups and journalists.	“If we get with all the right organizations, then we can, all together, hold these candidates accountable for their promises, which is also why we are trying to bring them to campus and get them on the record about these campaign promises so that we really have something to hold them accountable to,” she said.

	One word comes up in every conversation about Wayne Knoll: love.	An English professor and former Jesuit priest, Knoll, 80, died Nov. 10 after a three-month battle with an incurable and inoperable cancerous tumor. He joined the Georgetown faculty in 1972 and taught here for 41 years.	“Wayne said that the most satisfying element of being human and being alive is to love, to love others and to be loved,” Knoll’s wife, Rev. Anne Gehman, said.	Raised in Kansas, Knoll grew up with the tradition of the Catholic Church. He was gifted academically from a young age and finished all the books in his middle school library two years before he graduated eighth grade. He joined the Jesuit order before attending St. Louis University and then Harvard University for his doctorate in literature.	Throughout his studies, Knoll developed the singular dream of teaching at Georgetown. It was the only place he applied when searching for a job.	“I have never known any person with more single-minded purpose than Dr. Knoll. His goal was to become a professor of literature at Georgetown University,” Knoll’s biographer, Suzanne Giesemann, said. “He would not have settled for anything else.”	At Georgetown, students and colleagues adored him for his commitment to his work. Recognized for his talent for teaching literature, Knoll was honored with the Edward B. Bunn Award, given annually by the senior class, for excellence in teaching in 2006. His classes, including “Faulkner” and “Eliot’s Waste Land,” were among the most popular in the Department of English every semester.	While at Georgetown, Knoll made an enormous change: He left the Jesuit priesthood more than 25 years ago and later married Gehman, who is a world-renowned psychic medium.	Gehman described herself and her husband as soul mates, recalling their routine of beginning each morning with a meditation and a reading, whether from a philosophical book, a scientific work or scripture. She said they were brought together by their love for God and the “spiritual pathway of life” they shared.	“We have a totally different philosophical understanding,” she said. “He was very Catholic, while I’m more of a Universalist and accept truth in all the world religions. But it never made a difference to us that we had that difference, because we honored that in one another.”	Knoll’s life and transition from the priesthood was recorded in Giesemann’s biography “The Priest and the Medium,” which was published in 2009.	“When I interviewed him and asked him what it was like to leave the priesthood, he couldn’t talk about it. He had blanked it out of his mind,” Giesemann said. “It took him several days to dig up those very painful memories. It was so hard for him, because being a priest was his life.”	Knoll had not met Gehman at the time he decided to leave the Jesuit order.	“He didn’t leave the priesthood for any one woman – he left because he had to be true to himself. He wanted a more full life, eventually with a woman,” Giesemann said. “I know that he was incredibly happy with Anne, and with his life and with being able to teach at Georgetown. I know that he regrets that he could not be both a priest and a married man.”	English professor John Pfordresher, who joined the faculty a year after Knoll, said that Knoll never believed that he had truly left the priesthood.	“He never lost his sense that he was a Jesuit priest,” Pfordresher said. “He began to see his role as not in the traditional form of living in the Jesuit community and abiding by the original vows he had taken.”	“In his heart and soul, he was always a Jesuit priest,” Gehman said.	Friends and coworkers say Knoll continued his commitment to Jesuit ideals in all aspects of his life, especially teaching.	“He deeply cared for his students, and because of his enthusiasm and kindness, he was in turn cherished by them,” Interim Chair of the English Department Dennis Todd wrote in an email.	Connor Joseph (COL ’16) developed a close relationship with Knoll during the professor’s “Southern Literature” class.	“He became like a mentor to me last semester,” Joseph said. “I would go to office hours, and we would talk about how the writing related to my life.”	Knoll related his experience growing up in Kansas to Joseph, who was from North Dakota, also bringing in the texts they studied.	“He wanted to connect the literature to personal stories,” Joseph said. “He grew up in a small plains town like I did, and as we were reading this literature he would say to me, ‘This really has to do with what you’re going through.'”	Todd said that Knoll was one of the English department’s most popular teachers throughout the four decades he taught at Georgetown.	“His courses on Faulkner and T.S. Eliot were consistently filled to overflowing, and often there were many more students on the waitlists than were enrolled in his classes,” Todd wrote.	Pfordresher said that Knoll’s reputation as a fantastic teacher was well known among students.	“‘You’ve got to take Knoll before you graduate’ – I hear that a lot,” Pfordresher said.	Knoll taught University President John J. DeGioia during his time as an undergraduate.	“I had the privilege of being taught by Wayne as a student and then later becoming a colleague and friend,” DeGioia said. “Our community deeply feels this loss. Wayne’s commitment to his students, and his enthusiasm for his work was contagious. We were all made the better by it.”	Joseph said that Knoll’s intense love for students distinguished him from other professors.	“His love for students can hardly be matched, and his lectures on the importance of compassion and empathy are perfect representations of a life for others,” Joseph said. “When I think about Wayne Knoll, I think of a man who treasured his purpose as a professor.”	Knoll brought Gehman in to meet each of his classes every semester, and she said he spent a huge amount of time outside of class helping his students with whatever they may need.	“Although he left the priesthood, he was still a priest, and that knowledge and wisdom that he gained he shared with all of his students and loved ones. He just loved teaching, and loved all of his students,” she said.	Beyond his deep care for his students, Pfordresher said Knoll’s cheerful disposition made him a joy to see in the office.	“He had an irrepressible, high-spirited emotional life,” Pfordresher said. “Always up. He always had a big smile. … He was just a breath of fresh air and a radiant source of high spirits everywhere he went.”	Even near the end of his life, Knoll did not waver from his positivity.	“Wayne had no fear of death,” Gehman said. “It took him quite a while to finally accept the fact that there was no cure for his condition, but he just approached death as he approached life: with enthusiasm, and with joy, and with an open heart and an open mind.”	Knoll wrote a letter to his students after learning of his cancer that was posted on his office door. Modeling his behavior on that of St. Francis, who gave a name to everything in his life, Knoll named his cancerous tumor “Louie.”	“As a child of the modern era, I know that Louie was generated and is growing by following the bio chemical laws of nature,” Knoll wrote. “But I also know the power of prayer, especially in two respects. Prayer can effect miraculous intervention into natural process, and prayer can assist in developing and maintaining a positive spiritual attitude.”	The letter displayed his unwavering faith in God in the face of adversity.	“I totally accept my situation as ultimately coming from a loving God, Who created natural law and the freedom of the human heart,” he wrote. “I am drawn to reach out to all those whom I love. I would love to hear from you, as we all go to God together.”	Knoll’s funeral service was held Nov. 16 at the Center for Spiritual Enlightenment in Falls Church, Va., which Gehman founded and where she is a pastor. A memorial service will be held at Georgetown in January.	Knoll was not happy about leaving his loved ones during his last months, but he considered that separation to be temporary.	“He fully believed that he was going to go to God, and that he would be with God and that he would be waiting for Anne,” Pfordresher said. “He said to me, ‘You know, I’m a boy from Kansas. The way I picture things, I’ll be going to heaven, and I’ll be sitting on the front porch, waiting for Anne to come.'”

For the first time in 20 years, a tavern liquor license is now available for a Georgetown restaurant.
A tavern liquor license, as opposed to a restaurant liquor license, allows an establishment to rely more on alcohol sales. Restaurant liquor licenses mandate that food sales account for at least 45 percent of gross annual receipts, which requires a quarterly report sent to the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration.
The number of tavern or nightclub licenses in Georgetown is capped at six because the neighborhood is designated as an alcoholic beverage control moratorium zone, as are Adams Morgan, East Dupont Circle, West Dupont Circle and Glover Park. The number of tavern licenses for each moratorium zone varies, but other areas of the District do not carry any restrictions. Currently, Chadwick’s, El Centro D.F., Modern, Blue Gin and Rhino hold tavern licenses. El Centro was able to inherit Third Edition’s license when it took over its location earlier this year. There are no nightclub licenses in the neighborhood.
Saloun, which was located at 3239 M St. NW before it closed in October 2011, held the sixth license. Establishments can still keep liquor licenses after closing, as is the case with Blue Gin, which closed in November 2008, and Saloun did not give up its license until this year. The restaurant did not apply for renewal by the Sept. 30 deadline, and the ABRA cancelled the license Oct. 30.
“Restrictions have temporarily been lifted on alcoholic beverage licenses for taverns in the Georgetown Historic District,” ABRA announced in an online press release Nov. 13. “Taverns located in the Georgetown Historic District are permitted to transfer alcoholic beverage licenses to new owners and new locations within the area. An existing restaurant in the historic district will also be able to apply to become a tavern or nightclub in the neighborhood.”
Applications are available online and will be considered by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board on a first-come, first-serve basis. As of press time, two Georgetown restaurants, Gypsy Sally’s, at 3401 K St. NW, and Smith Point, at 1338 Wisconsin Ave. NW, have submitted applications for a tavern liquor license, in that order. Applicants must undergo a background investigation that includes a criminal history check.
“Because I personally am the person who’s doing all of the administrative work for those reports that have to be done, I thought, ‘Oh my goodness, wouldn’t this be great if I didn’t have to do this any longer?’” Gypsy Sally’s co-owner Karen Ensor said. “Having a tavern license, you don’t have to have any filing requirements, so I thought it would be a nice relief to not have to do that.”
Although a tavern license would alleviate the pressure of meeting the food sales restriction, Ensor said that it would not change the restaurant’s overall business plan, which combines food, alcohol and live music.
“We have no intention of changing our business plan because concert dining is what we want to continue to do, so we still will be serving food here every single evening,” Ensor said. “I don’t think it’s going to change our customer base at all.”
Rhino Bar General Manager David Nelson called ABRA’s first-come, first-serve policy unfair because it does not take into consideration an establishment’s reputation or history.
“Places like Martin’s Tavern, which is the oldest liquor license in Georgetown, if they applied for it, don’t you think they would deserve it more so than anyone else? Because it doesn’t benefit Georgetown who has it, it just benefits the person that has it,” Nelson said. “Places like Martin’s Tavern that’s been here longer than anybody, they obviously deserve it more.”
Overall, Nelson argued that the moratorium’s restrictions on Georgetown’s businesses are detrimental.
“It doesn’t benefit Georgetown at all if a place like Gypsy Sally’s goes from a restaurant to a tavern,” Nelson said. “It benefits Georgetown if more liquor licenses, restaurants [and] bars are allowed to actually come here.”
Smith Point did not respond to requests for comment.

MedStar Georgetown University Hospital commemorated the 20th anniversary of the KIDS Mobile Medical Clinic/Ronald McDonald Care Mobile on Tuesday, when program sponsors, clinicians, D.C. councilmembers and patients gathered to celebrate at the Old Naval Hospital.
The mobile clinic, a 40-foot long trailer, launched in 1992 and serves medically underserved children in the District’s Wards 5, 6 and 7 four times a week. Although this year is technically the program’s 21st year, MedStar Georgetown spokesperson Marianne Worley said the program decided to celebrate the anniversary belatedly.
The program also established two permanent clinics in 2006 at Anacostia High School and at the D.C. General Emergency Family Shelter. All services are free of charge, and Georgetown medical students staff the clinics on a volunteer basis.
“We were excited 20 years ago when the mobile clinic started serving the communities with the greatest needs at a time when very few families had access to good quality health care,” MedStar Georgetown Director of Community Pediatrics Matthew Levy said. “Over the years, we’ve helped thousands of kids stay healthy, stay in school, learn and grow to their full potential. We’re proud of them and proud to still be serving the community 20 years later.”
David Nelson, chair of the Georgetown University Medical Center pediatrics department, expressed pride in Georgetown’s desire to provide medical attention to the underserved.
“Georgetown was the only academic institution in the city to show interest in helping this community in Southeast and Southwest D.C.,” Nelson said. “It was and is a combination of community service and medical practice, two areas that Georgetown prides itself on. People were skeptical about what Georgetown was doing in this part of the District and said that our commitment wouldn’t last. Well, now we’re here 20 years, and I think that we’ve more than proved ourselves to this community that we care and are here to stay.”
Over 20 years, the clinic has helped approximately 50,000 children from birth to their 22nd birthday. Each year, the clinic treats between 900 and 1,200 patients and immunizes an average of 300 children.
“I want to thank not only our partners and sponsors, but also the families who have welcomed us into their neighborhoods,” M. Joy Drass, MedStar Health executive vice president of operations for the Washington region, said. “The trust and relationship that we’ve built with you is very important to us, and we intend to care for and give medical access for as many children in the city as possible.”
In 2000, eight years after the clinic launched, MedStar purchased Georgetown University Hospital Clinical Enterprises. Although maintaining the medical clinic was not a requirement of the deal, MedStar chose to continue operations and expanded its reach, despite the fact that the hospital was losing $30 million every year at the time.
“We celebrate the dedication and commitment to children’s health that we all have. We believe in cura personalis, the health of the total person, body and mind,” MedStar Georgetown Vice President of Philanthropy Katie Coyle said. “As such, we make sure that kids have access to health services that would otherwise be unavailable for them and also receive for their overall wellness.”
Between 2002 and 2007, the mobile clinic also partnered with the Department of Health and D.C. Public Schools’ Immunization Taskforce, which organized immunization clinics for students at the start of each school year.
Mayoral candidate and councilmember Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6), a former member of the D.C. Consortium for Child Welfare, emphasized the importance of providing immunizations and medical care to the underserved.
“Bringing health services like immunizations to the young people of this city, those without the proper health resources, has been a major priority of mine in 30 years of public service in the District,” Wells said. “Taking care of our children makes our city one that we can believe in, one that reflects the values that make up who we are.”
Owen Rennert, former chair of the MedStar Georgetown pediatrics department, joined in the praise.
“Georgetown takes great care to embody authenticity and service. We aspire to the Ignatian quality of magis, meaning being more, serving more,” Rennert said. “This inspires our vision. We do good work here, and we believe that children all deserve the same right to health care.”
Levy, who has run the mobile clinic for the last 14 years, said that the clinic has been a medical practice trendsetter by engaging the community with a teenage-based approach and focusing on wellness and disease prevention.
Moreover, Levy emphasized the importance of a holistic view of patient care outside of merely medical care. In the 2013 Annual Magnet Nurse Champion Backpack Drive, the mobile clinic helped to distributed over 350 backpacks. In addition, since 1999, the program has distributed more than 7,000 toys to children and adolescents during the holiday season.
“The overall improvement in the lives of children that the clinic serves is the main drive behind the effort,” Levy said. “We have become a family center, a community base and built trusting relationships with residents in Southeast and Southwest D.C. as a result. I look forward to the next 20 years of KMMC/RMCM research, advocacy, innovation and service to this community.”

	On Wednesday night, members of the Georgetown community paid for dinner at a fundraiser. But rather than the usual catered fundraising fare, attendees received a few snacks based on different D.C. wards.	The first Hunger Banquet in the Bioethics Library, sponsored by the Jesuit University Humanitarian Action Network Fellows in conjunction with D.C. Reads, the D.C. Schools Project, Delta Phi Epsilon, HOPE and the Community Garden, sought to raise awareness about nutritional disparities within the District and raised approximately $400 for the nonprofit Bread for the City.	The JUHA banquet was styled after the Oxfam model, where participants’ seating at the event reflected how different areas of a city have access to food. To that end, attendees were divided and seated by D.C. wards. Participants in Wards 3 and 4 received milk, water, carrots and ranch, while attendees assigned Ward 6 and 7 ate soda and chips.	“I don’t know how shocking our [event] will be, but the idea of a shock factor is important,” JUHAN Fellow Whitney Pratt (COL ’14) said. “I think having that visualization can really spur conversation and discussion that just having a lecture doesn’t really encourage as much.”	“A lot of work that we do is internationally or globally focused, but we wanted to also bear in mind that there are issues in our own city, not too far from us, even within our own Ward 2, where we live that are serious and need to be addressed,” JUHAN Fellow Sophia Berhie (SFS ’14) added.	School of Nursing & Health Studies professor Myrtle McCulloch spoke about child obesity and its perpetuation in low-income areas during the event.	“Instead of the grocery stores, what you see are corridors of fast food restaurants, and these fast food restaurants pick those areas to open their various places because they know that’s where they’re going to get most of their money,” McCulloch said.	McCulloch also said a large problem is that children in poorer areas are not used to eating vegetables.	“People who live there have been living on a diet of french fries and stuff like that,” she said. “You’ve got generation after generation that didn’t get used to eating vegetables. So even if you give it to them, they don’t want it.”	Catherine Benvie (COL ’07), who works at D.C. Hunger Solutions, addressed the stigma around food stamps.	“I think it’s important to note that most households are only on food stamps for about six to eight months. I think there’s a perception out there that people stay on food stamps for years, but that really isn’t true,” Benvie said.	In addition to the banquet, the JUHAN fellows organized a date for students to volunteer at Bread for the City’s southeast center, tentatively set for Dec. 13.	“We don’t want this to just be the end of the educational experience,” JUHAN Fellow Mary Oeftering (SFS ’14) said. “We want this to be the kind of event that motivates people to take action.”

	The newly created Office of Sustainability highlighted its goal to cut university greenhouse gas emissions 50 percent before 2020 during the inaugural Sustainable Planning Campus Workshop on Tuesday night.	The workshop was held in the Intercultural Center in conjunction with the Office of Planning and Facilities Management.	“This is a very ambitious charge, but we’re working toward it,” Director of the Office of Sustainability Audrey Stewart said. “Part of what we’re doing here is creating our carbon roadmap.”	Administrators and students involved with sustainability on campus presented their work and aspirations to the approximately 50 people in attendance.	Stewart described the university’s sustainability goals, such as its pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions significantly in the coming years.	The university has earned accolades in this regard, including recognition from the Environmental Protection Agency as “Green Power Partner of the Year” and achieving bronze status for bicycle friendliness.	Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey said that the university’s sustainability was a key consideration in master planning. Morey said that improving sidewalks would encourage bicycle use and utilizing green technology such as rainwater runoff collection would prove beneficial to the campus community.	“We think about smart growth strategies and making sure our transportation is sustainable, as well as enhancing our green spaces on campus,” Morey said.	With energy conservation measures, there could be monetary as well as environmental perks.	“We let the capital savings, from an operational perspective, fund the actual capital investment moving forward,” Stewart said. The Office of Sustainability hopes to have a draft of a sustainability plan within the next six months, Stewart added.	During the workshop the land and grounds table highlighted potential changes to university aesthetics such as improving the Regents center lawn, developing North Kehoe field into green space, adding trees to the green space near the Jesuit residence or creating a community garden near the Leavey Center.	At the water discussion table, facilitated by Makaiah Mohler (COL ’16), individuals proposed creating “green roofs,” planting trees and shrubs on Harbin Patio and outside New South and eliminating Georgetown’s contract with Coca-Cola in order to restrict its advertising influence and promote student health.	“Discussions are going great because both students and faculty are really excited about making Georgetown a more sustainable campus,” Mohler said.

With the Washington, D.C. mayoral race still in its infancy, rhetoric from the six major Democratic contenders appears populist, attempting to reach across all sectors of the D.C. population.
This is particularly noteworthy given the District’s historical divisions across socioeconomic and racial lines. Recent economic progress has alleviated the situation in some wards, but this progress has not translated across all neighborhoods. Government professor Mark Rom pointed to the recent D.C. Council push to raise the minimum wage as further evidence of economic tension in the District.
On Sept. 12, Mayor Vincent Gray vetoed the Large Retailer Accountability Act, which would have required large retail employers such as Walmart to pay employees $12.50 per hour. The Living Wage for All of D.C., a bill introduced by mayoral candidate and council member Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6), is now before the council. The bill seeks to raise the minimum wage for all employees in Washington, D.C.., from $8.25 to $10.25 over the next two years.
“Washington, D.C., has become more prosperous and safe in recent years, but large swaths of the public have not shared in that prosperity, hence the discussions of ‘living wages,'” Rom said.
Busboys and Poets owner and mayoral candidate Andy Shallal agreed.
“One of the problems that we have right now is the fact that this city does not have a unified vision that says this city must work for everyone, not just for some,” Shallal said.
These campaign messages run parallel with those expressed during the recent New York mayoral race, during which Democratic mayor-elect Bill de Blasio defeated Republican opponent Joe Lhota (GSB ’76) by 49 percentage points – the largest margin of victory since Edward Koch won by a 68 percent margin in 1985. De Blasio’s victory reflected a growing dissatisfaction with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his pro-business policies, with many seeing Bloomberg as favoring the wealthy in New York City.
In the District, many of the Democratic candidates are implementing a similar policy by emphasizing wards that need more economic support. For example, candidate and Councilmember Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4) has proposed creating the position of deputy mayor, who would solely address the needs of District residents living east of the Anacostia River. This is a primary black area that has not seen the same boost in economic development in recent years that U Street and Columbia Heights have.
“The deputy mayor would coordinate the delivery of services to a large part of our city that for a long time has been underserved and underdeveloped,” Bowser Campaign Chairperson Bill Lightfoot said.
In addition to economic disparities in the region, Rom focused on the racial aspects of the campaign. If Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) or Wells were elected, either could be the first white mayor in the District’s history since self-rule was instated in 1975. Detroit, which has also had a history of black mayors, elected Mike Duggan (D) its first white mayor in its Nov. 5 election.
“The racial aspects of the election will bear watching,” Rom said. “D.C. has not had a white mayor ever, at least not since home rule, but it is now a majority-white city with two white councilmembers in the race.”
Rom, however, added that the Detroit race had been decided by competency, not by racial tendencies; Duggan had a strong reputation of being a “Mr. Fix-It.”
Regardless of the lines that divide the District, however, the region remains largely Democratic. No Republican candidates have announced intentions to run for the mayoral office, and all mayors since 1975 have been Democratic.

	University President John J. DeGioia and Provost Robert Groves outlined the challenges facing Georgetown in the 21st century at the “Designing the Future(s) of the University” inaugural event Wednesday.	DeGioia and Groves said that Georgetown would need to address changes, including new educational technology, reductions in government funding for academic research and rising tuition costs accompanied by declining family incomes. Approximately 50 people attended the discussion, most of whom were faculty.	“We’ve decided to be proactive about these choices, not reactive,” Groves said.	DeGioia emphasized Georgetown’s three-pronged role in serving students, faculty and the public.	“Universities bring together young people in a period of profound formation with older, experienced individuals possessing an unusual degree of experience and knowledge,” DeGioia said.	Aside from this role, DeGioia said universities are also expected to contribute to the public by preparing the workforce and fostering economic development and national identity.	“While these expectations ebb and flow, together they constitute the ongoing public and political discourse about the role of the universities today,” DeGioia said.	Public universities, which provide nearly 80 percent of higher education, have seen a decline in government funding from around 63 percent in 1975 to around 34 percent today. This reduction plays a large role in the planning of many universities.	“In some of the significant discussions taking place, these smart networked players are asserting that there will never be one government dime more in support of public higher education,” DeGioia said. “Education is to become the purview of foundations and for-profit companies. We have lost the sense of education as a public good.”	DeGioia emphasized that liberal education is about much more than mere transmission of information or career training.	“If the intellect is focused on discovering truth, this second dimension is focused on living the good,” he said. “We also impart a way of living, a way of being that accompanies along with the information.”	DeGioia said that, even in the face of the role of developing technology such as massive online open courses, time in the classroom is essential.	“There’s a place for the technology,” DeGioia said. “I do believe the most precious resource we have is the time of our faculty. No one else in our society is charged with the responsibility that faculty are.”	DeGioia also spoke of the ways in which Georgetown students complement faculty efforts.	“You could not have a better set of people to be with than our students,” DeGioia said.	Many students in the audience were pleased that DeGioia included their input in the discussion.	“It’s interesting that Georgetown has this dialogue with students,” Jonah Joselow (COL ’15) said. “They are committed to a lot of great things.”	Although the event began dialogue on the future of education, the direction the initiative will take remains uncertain.	“I think it’s a fantastic new initiative that’s very important,” Ben Weiss (COL ’15) said. “The administration is really behind being a forward thinking university for the future. What that new future will be is still kind of up in the air.”

	Georgetown closed FY13 with a surplus of $2.7 million, the university’s first operating surplus since FY02.	“We’ve been on a path to balance the budget,” Vice President for Financial Affairs David Rubenstein said. “That resulted in a small surplus, other than what we had started out with at the beginning of the year, which was a small deficit.”	The university’s $1.121 billion in revenues exceeded its $1.118 billion in expenses during the last fiscal year, which was the first year of a new five-year financial plan.	The plan, approved in February 2012 and implemented at the start of FY13, aims to create an operating surplus of $2.1 million by the conclusion of FY16.	The main campus’s $15.9 million surplus was up $3.2 million from FY12, despite the cost of construction on Regents Hall and the School of Continuing Studies’ new downtown location.	“We had very good fundraising performance. We had some one-time revenue items such as in the summer school area, and we have had ongoing tight expense control,” Rubenstein said.	The Georgetown University Law Center, which ended FY12 with a $40,000 deficit, saw a $4.5 million surplus at the close of FY2013. This was slightly above the projected $4.4 million surplus.	Among other university departments, there was a combined $7.2 million budget surplus, up from the $1.9 million deficit experienced during FY12.	Georgetown University Medical Center was the only area of the university that did not have a surplus, instead operating with a $24.9 million deficit. According to Rubenstein, this deficit was largely the result of the high overhead costs of biomedical research, which the federal government does not fully cover.	Despite GUMC’s expenses, however, it remains a major source of revenue, with a $21.0 million increase in revenue over the last fiscal year.	Enrollment increase in the School of Nursing & Health Studies’ online nursing masters programs, and a $12.8 million revenue-sharing payment from MedStar Health increased GUMC revenues.	“The faculty at the medical center are generating a lot of revenue in terms of tuition revenue from teaching and grants,” Rubenstein said.	“If we didn’t put in those funds to support the research mission, we actually couldn’t generate all of the other revenues,” Rubenstein said.	In addition, the endowment’s success during FY13 contributed to its operating performance. The university’s $1.2 billion endowment generated $72 million in revenue, contributing to the $119 million increase in the university’s total assets. This 11.8 percent rate of return was a sizeable increase from FY12’s 0.9 percent.	In addition to an increase in investment returns, the university also saw a 32.4 percent increase in gifts to the university. Frank McCourt’s (CAS ’75) record-breaking $100 million donation was received after the conclusion of the fiscal year and was not included in the data.	Overall, Rubenstein attributed Georgetown’s financial success to cooperation across the university.	“The performance is really attributed to the university acting as a whole community – it’s not anything that any one individual is responsible for,” Rubenstein said. “Many people worked very hard over the past fiscal year, and they sacrificed as well in order to make this all happen.”

	The national tour of the Reel Rock 8 film festival will screen a series of documentaries about rock climbing in conjunction with Georgetown’s Outdoor Education Program and Club Rock Climbing Saturday night, giving both groups sought-after visibility on campus.	“Reel Rock is designed to appeal to both people who are into climbing, and also just the general population who might be sort of interested. You don’t have to be a climber to come and enjoy the show,” Club Rock Climbing Treasurer Maggie Axelrod (COL ’15) said. “To bring some visibility to Climbing and Outdoor Ed would be great, and just to make it a great event for people at Georgetown and for climbers in the neighboring area.”	A traveling series of four short documentaries about rock climbing, Reel Rock 8 has made stops across the country.	Since forming last year, Club Rock Climbing has nearly doubled its membership to 20 students.	Zack Sawyer (COL ’15), a rock climbing instructor with Outdoor Education and a Club Rock Climbing member who helped plan the event, emphasized that the films promote the essence of rock climbing.	“It’s sort of a story of these individuals who have completely dedicated their lives to mastering what is not just, for them, a sport, but an art as well,” Sawyer said.	Club Rock Climbing Vice President Alex Koeberle (COL ’14) said the communal experience of the film festival mimics that of the climbing community.	“Climbing is a sport in one sense, but you don’t compete against anyone else,” Koeberle said. “It’s a collective action of conquering something, so it fosters a lot more of people helping each other and cheering each other on.”	While Outdoor Education played a limited role in event planning, the organization hoped that the event would help raise awareness for the rock climbing community at Georgetown.	“If people see the film and equate it with Outdoor Education, that’s great, but it’s really just to drum up support for climbing,” Director of Outdoor Education Kris Nessler said.	Koeberle expressed optimism that Georgetown could become a recurring host for the Reel Rock film festival as future series are released.	“To be honest, we don’t really know what to expect,” he said. “We’ve done really well with selling tickets so far. I think we’re hoping for triple digits.”	“It’s just a story of really great people just as psyched to teach a new climber their basic knots as they are to crush some of the hardest and most beautiful lines in the world,” Sawyer said.

	Georgetown seems to have a student group for every culture, from the Caribbean Culture Circle to the French Cultural Association. Last year, however, a group of students founded a club for a culture whose characteristics might not be as immediately apparent.	Although the Brilliantly British Club only received Student Activities Commission approval last week, it has already held five events this semester.	Club President Beatrice Fabris (COL ’16), who is from London, conceived the club this summer to fill a cultural gap and foster communal spirit.	“One of the main reasons we had the idea to set up this club was because there were quite a lot of people who thought ‘We speak the same language; we are friendly, similar places,'” Fabris said. “No, the United Kingdom and America are very different places, and they each have their own merits, don’t get me wrong. But we really wanted to sort of broaden everyone’s experience of the United Kingdom.”	Before receiving SAC approval last Monday, the club relied on funding from primarily New Club Development, a program within SAC. Club leaders also spent their own money to put on events.	Taking off quickly this semester, the club’s five events have included two movie nights, one funded and cosponsored by the International Relations Club, and a lecture by Paul Smith, the director of the British Council in the United States.	Additionally, club members tabled at Student Activities Fair, where more than 150 students signed up, and D.C. Reads Fall Fest on Nov. 3. The group has plans for at least six events next semester with SAC funding.	Before they established the club, Fabris and other club members contacted Georgetown’s U.K. recruitment head to receive the email addresses of accepted Georgetown students from the United Kingdom to offer congratulations.	The club is considering holding a meet-up in London for early acceptance students over winter break.	“This is because the official Georgetown meet-up was very crowded, and we want to give prospective U.K. students the chance to meet current British Georgetown students in a more student-friendly environment,” executive board member Michael Newton (SFS ’17) said.	The club also hopes to help connect students with internships abroad.	“The career center does not have good links at all with the U.K. They’re pretty much nonexistent, which is ridiculous considering we have so many alumni at least in London,” Treasurer Jeannine Rogers (COL ’16) said.	Brilliantly British members are happy with the progress they’ve made so far.	“We are so grateful and happy and proud of everything that the Georgetown students have given to us as an organization because we are new, and they embraced us and came to our events, all different nationalities. None of this could happen without their support and enthusiasm,” Fabris said.

	The Georgetown University Police Department discussed several of its newest initiatives during its second roundtable Wednesday evening.	During a discussion facilitated by Georgetown University Student Association Deputy Chief of Staff Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15), Chief of Police Jay Gruber and Deputy Chief Joseph Smith discussed the SafeRides program, the Outdoor Student Living Pilot Program and the recent laptop ban for student guards and accompanying enforcement through security cameras. Only three non-media students were in attendance.	Students pressed Gruber on these changes to the student guard program.	“These student guards are an important line of defense for our residence halls,” Gruber said. “I need these student guards to be vigilant of what’s going on around them.”	In particular, students questioned the department’s new video-monitoring policy, which was announced in an email to student guards from Student Guard Program Assistant Manager Matthew Brands. According to Gruber, however, the policy had not been approved by the department and was only instituted by the program managers.	“I’m not afraid to say that a student guard was brought in, disciplined, sanctioned and reminded that this type of correspondence cannot go out unless it’s vetted by us,” Gruber said. “We are not using the cameras to monitor the day-to-day activities of student guards.”	In reference to additional security measures, Gruber also discussed a possible “If I Were a Thief” program, in which resident assistants enter unlocked rooms and leave notes about what could have possibly have been stolen if they were thieves.	The roundtable also focused on common points of student interest in regard to DPS: alcohol policy and the role of DPS officers on campus. Gruber spoke in detail about the Outdoor Student Living Pilot Program, which launched in September and allows students of legal age to consume alcoholic beverages outside in certain areas of Village A and Henle Village.	“We want the campus to be a place where people want to come to socialize,” Gruber said.	Smith and Gruber said that the success of this program has made GUPD more open to testing the program in other student residences on and off campus.	“When it goes to the spring semester, we’ll evaluate it,” Gruber said. “If it was as good as the fall semester, I don’t know why we wouldn’t implement it full-time as policy and hope to expand it to Alumni Square and LXR.” Gruber and Smith also responded to questions about the GUPD’s practice of shutting down parties. Smith stressed that GUPD does not seek out parties and only responds to direct complaints.	“Contrary to urban myth, we really don’t want to be doing party patrol,” Smith said. “We want you to be able to socialize and have a good time.” Gruber also addressed the creation of a SafeRides steering committee, which will be composed of an officer and six students. According to Nick Walker (SFS ’16), a member of the Student Safety Advisory Board, possible ideas include redefining SafeRides boundaries and reexamining high-demand routes.	“We will look into extending or decreasing boundaries by looking at all of the phone calls made to SafeRides and see what the most common routes are,” Walker said. “A lot of students request rides from Prospect to Burleith. We could have a shuttle run that route regularly on weekday nights because the neighborhood shuttles only run on weekends.”	Another focus for the committee is the SafeRides driver program. Currently, a combination of officers and students drive the vans, but the committee will decide whether to transition into a fully student-run program or to lease to an outside company. This would free officers to oversee other campus safety issues.	“I’m interested in having those security officers at two o’clock in the morning to be at 37th and Prospect Street just to monitor the activities and see what’s going on,” Gruber said. “I would rather have officers at the Canal Road where they monitor vehicles coming into campus. If I can get the students to drive the vans, I can re-task the officers.” Gruber also discussed the upcoming SafeRides app, which will be available for testing in the spring. The app functions similarly to popular taxi-hailing service Uber and will determine a student’s location via GPS and notify students of wait time. The app would also send an additional notification once the car arrives.	“It’s a service important and centric to students, and we need to do it well,” Gruber said. “There are obviously things that we are not doing well – the way we answer the phones, the estimated time of arrival [and] the demeanor of some of the van drivers.” Tezel said that the next roundtable would probably occur in late February.
