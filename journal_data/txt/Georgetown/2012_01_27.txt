O’Donovan Hall employees staged a demonstration at about 12:35 p.m. Thursday to voice frustration at the slow pace of contract negotiations between the union they formed last year and their employer,Aramark Higher Education.
About 40 Georgetown University Dining Services employees, accompanied by members of the Georgetown Solidarity Committee, gathered on the top floor of the dining hall, chanting phrases such as “What do we want? A contract. When do we want it? Now,” and “We’ll be back.” Students not involved with the GSC also joined as the demonstration grew.
“It really showed how much Georgetown students care about workers in their community,” GSCmember Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) said.
The union operates under the umbrella of UNITE HERE, a national organization for food service employees, and includes employees of Leo’s, the Jesuit Residence, Cosi, Starbucks and thePreclinical Building’s Dr. Mug.
Although the union was certified in March, members say that they still have not been given fair wages or a more affordable health care program. According to Kohnert-Yount, Aramark employees pay more for health care than any other group of workers at Georgetown.
“What [the employees] want to show is that they’re united and they have the support of students,” Samuel Geaney-Moore (SFS ’12), a GSC member, said.
Geaney-Moore explained that the demonstration was a way for students, particularly those originally involved in the unionization efforts, to show support for the employees’ campaign.
“It’s great to see the workers and students together. To me that’s the real meaning of solidarity,”Aramark employee and union leader Donté Crestwell wrote in a press release. “We are seeking a living wage, reasonable benefits and a 40-hour work week for all. We’re glad that we’ve had the support of Georgetown students through this process.”
Thursday’s participants kept the demonstration a secret until it began during the lunchtime rush on a day on which Aramark officials were on campus.
After the short demonstration, employees immediately returned to work, and members of theGSC passed out flyers to inform students of the progress of negotiations thus far.

Cases against three students charged with breaking into offices in the fourth floor of the Leavey Center last August were dismissed Wednesday, according to court records.
Sam Buckley (COL ’14) and Eric Pilch (COL ’12) had been charged with two misdemeanors of destruction of property under $1,000 and unlawful entry.
John Flanagan (SFS ’14) was also charged with destruction of property under $1,000.
The three students had signed a deferred prosecution agreement at a preliminary hearing in September. The agreement gave them a four-month probationary period and set a second hearing to settle the case for Jan. 25.
The outcome of Wednesday’s hearing meant that the trio had successfully abided by the guidelines of the deferral agreement and all charges against them have now been dropped.
The three students were accused of damaging offices on the fourth floor of the Leavey Center while trying to evade Department of Public Safety officers Aug. 28. The prosecution alleged that the students entered the offices by crawling through a drop ceiling in the office of The Georgetown Voice. Buckley and Flanagan were Voice staffers at the time of the incident, though both were later dismissed from the publication.

Two suspects were captured on camera stealing several computer monitors from a loading dock at the New Research Building at 2:30 p.m. Thursday, according to the Department of Public Safety.
The theft was discovered at 9:00 a.m. Friday, when a Georgetown employee saw that the monitors were missing. Video surveillance footage showed two suspects loading the equipment into a white, two-door Dodge Ram. No other property appears to have been stolen.
The first suspect is described in a DPS public safety alert as about 5-foot-10 to six feet tall, about 35 to 45 years old and dressed in a black track jacket, dark pants, white shoes and a baseball cap. The second suspect was a 35 to 40-year-old black male wearing a baseball cap, a dark jacket and dark cargo pants.
DPS and the Metropolitan Police Department responded to the scene and are investigating the incident.

In order to better accommodate the over 60 percent of students, faculty and staff who commute to campus, the university and its Law Center ramped up their bicycling initiatives this past semester.
The university is working to reduce the number of community members who drive to and from campus each day by making cycling safer and more convenient, according to John Lichtefeld (LAW ’10), the former sustainability fellow at the Law Center. The fellowship was a temporary position that ended in 2011.
“President DeGioia has set a target of a 50 percent reduction in carbon emissions from Georgetown by 2020, and we’re doing our part to make sure we reach that,”Lichtefeld wrote in an email.
Installing more Capital Bikeshare stations on or near campus has been a major focus of the main campus bicycling initiative. The public bike rental program currently has 1,100 bikes available throughout D.C. and Arlington, including locations outside the main campus gates and one block away from the Law Center.
In his time as a sustainability fellow, Lichtefeld worked closely with the Georgetown Law Green Committee on recycling and composting projects and a carbon dioxide reduction plan. The committee developed the idea for a bicycle tool kit, which was packaged and sold to students and faculty at the Law Center.
Lichtefeld also contributed to a project headed by Christopher Jewell, a member of the Green Committee, who developed a listserv database for community members who cycle to and from campus. The matching system is organized by zip code, allowing bicycle commuters to share route information or ride together in a ‘bike pool.’
The Law Center also increased the number of covered bicycle parking spaces it offers to protect the bikes from the elements and from theft, but bicycle commuters did not use the covered parking as much as the university expected.
“We’ve found that our daily commuters are not interested in [taking] additional time to park their bikes in the garage and seem to prefer the campus racks,” Therese Stratton, an administrator at the Law Center, wrote in an email.
Dimitrios Roumeliotis (MSB ’15), who uses his bike to get to crew practice every morning, believes that the main campus needs to provide better bike storage options.
“Georgetown could provide inside storage for bikes on campus over breaks, so students don’t have to worry about their bikes getting ruined or stolen,” he said.
The main campus has 1,616 parking spaces available for bikes, including covered parking in theLeavey and Southwest Quad parking garages. Outdoor parking is also available throughout campus. However, the Transportation Report included in the 2010 Campus Plan made the point that not only is more long-term bike parking space needed but also that bicycle rack designs on campus use space inefficiently, forcing bicyclists to use railings or poles to secure their bikes when racks are full or unavailable.
The Department of Public Safety also supports bicycling initiatives by running a bicycle registration program and assisting in the donation of abandoned bicycles to local organizations. The registration program allows bike owners to record their bike serial number with DPS so stolen or lost bikes can be more easily located.

University administrators presented a plan to facilitate the relationship between students and university administrative offices at the third Hoya Roundtable Wednesday.
The event, moderated by Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson in Sellinger Lounge, was the first of a continuing series of discussions intended to connect student concerns with the administration’s initiatives this semester.
Representatives from the Division of Student Affairs, including Health Education Services, Residence Life, Student Conduct and Off-Campus Student Life, addressed questions concerning sustainability, finances, diversity and field space for club and intramural teams.
The Student Affairs Strategic Plan, which was presented by the administration at the event, outlined five goals for the upcoming year, including bettering student spaces and support services, fostering healthy partnerships with the outside community and taking a proactive, holistic approach to student development.
“Life is a balancing act,” Olson said. “Students are engaged on campus academically and socially in so many ways, and we are trying to help them keep everything in order. The lesson here is that conversations are beneficial to everyone’s experience on campus.”
Eitan Paul (SFS ’12), a Georgetown University Student Association Senator and co-author of the soon to be released Student Life Report, was optimistic about the direction in which student-faculty relations are heading. However, he notes, however, that the administration should provide more details regarding how it expects to tackle the issues raised.
“I would especially like to streamline the process of accessing student spaces and services,” Paul said.
Many students in attendance expressed concerns about reducing administrative inefficiency.
According to Olson, the open format of the roundtables is an integral part of this new approach the university has attempted to pursue this academic year.
“I am encouraged by the whole initiative of this event,” Olson said. “It is a new way to create public transparency and continue discussions about issues affecting our community.”

All campaign calls begin roughly the same way.
“Hello, may I speak with Mrs. Smith, please? I’m calling on behalf of Jon Huntsman for President.”
Follow the script, mark off the paper and repeat five hundred times — that is phone banking in a nutshell, according to Georgetown alumus Colin Nagle (COL ‘11). Nagle worked for the Jon Huntsman campaign this past year, and phone banking was one of his chief duties.
“[Call scripts] would differ from event to event, but they would mostly be the same,” Nagle said. “I would change it up now and then so I wouldn’t sound so robotic — and also to see if I could increase my odds by doing things differently.”
His tricks paid off. According to Nagle, his calls elicited the highest turnout at events.
“My first day on the job, [Huntsman] went up in the polls five percent,” he joked. “I take full responsibility, though I had nothing to do with it.”
For students interested in furthering their own careers, joining a campaign can offer unparalleled hands-on political experience. The prolonged Republican primary process has given plenty of Georgetown students the opportunity to try their hand at presidential politics.
Kevin Preskenis (COL ’12) got his first taste of life on the campaign trail while working on Newt Gingrich’s presidential bid. Preskenis has been working for the candidate since high school but has recently stepped up his involvement.
“I get a sense of the pulse of America as I travel to different states and find ways of reaching out to voters,” he wrote in an email.
Balancing life as a student and a campaign worker is not easy.
“It has certainly been a challenge,” Preskenis wrote. “My phone is always buzzing through classes and it is difficult to not check my email. But I do my best to compartmentalize where I can, and so far, so good.”
Ziad Jawadi (COL ’15) hopes that his work on the Gingrich campaign will help launch his own political career.
While attending the Values Voter Summit a few months ago, Jawadi told Gingrich that he supported the candidate’s proposal of a loyalty test for Muslims.
“I made a comment [that] kind of struck him,” Jawadi said. “He didn’t expect any Muslim to agree with him.”
After the conversation, Gingrich asked Jawadi to work for him as student director for Muslim outreach, a position Jawadi has made his own.
“So far, he’s kind of had me doing my own independent thing,” Jawadi said.
Jawadi began looking into finding other Muslims who support Gingrich and has worked on writing policy memos highlighting some of Gingrich’s commitments to Muslim Americans.
As an Arabic and government double major who hopes to make a presidential run by the time he turns 40, Jawadi has definite political aspirations. But he claimed that real enthusiasm, not calculation, motivated his support of Gingrich.
“If I wanted to be ambitious, I would have picked Mitt Romney,” Jawadi said. “Working for [Gingrich] is genuine.”
Working for a campaign can also pave a path to even more appealing jobs. Maggie Cleary (COL ’14), president of the Georgetown University College Republicans and head of Georgetown’s chapter of Students for Mitt, put the matter simply.
“If your guy wins, you get a job in the White House,” she said.
Cleary has spent the last few months working with Students for Mitt to coordinate on-campus events, attend District-wide meetings with other local colleges and organize trips and phone banking events. Her organization has attracted a diverse group of supporters, she said.
“It’s definitely an interesting bunch of characters,” she said of the people she’s worked with while campaigning.
For many collegiate campaign workers, studying in D.C. has been instrumental in promoting their interest in politics.
Jawadi stressed that Georgetown’s location in the national capital helped to facilitate his involvement in the campaign, since he would not otherwise have attended the Values Voter Summit.
“I wouldn’t have had this opportunity if I’d gone to a different school,” he said.

Chris Clements, who was elected president of the Burleith Citizens Association in November, assumed his position this month. The BCA has been a vocal opponent of Georgetown’s 2010 Campus Plan and has provided testimony at numerous Zoning Commission hearings on the plan. The Hoya sat down with Clements to get his take on the Campus Plan and a range of other neighborhood relations issues.
The Hoya: What, in your opinion, are the biggest issues facing the residents of Burleith?
Chris Clements: Unfortunately, the obvious answer is the Georgetown Campus Plan. Obviously, that’s dominated just about everything over the last year, but my hope is that we’ll get some resolution on that one way or another, and then we can move beyond that and address some newer concerns that might have been marginalized because there was so much focus on the GU Campus Plan. My hope is that we can start and encourage residents and students alike to start formulating some things you want to see your neighborhood association undertake.
The Hoya: How do you and the rest of the BCA leadership feel about Georgetown’s Campus Plan as presented to the Zoning Commission Nov. 17?
Clements: At that point, the die had been cast, and I kind of feel that [after] … we got past the final hearing … there were just some issues I don’t think the administration or the neighborhood associations were going to come to agree on. That’s why you have adjudicating bodies like the Zoning Commission. I think the consensus … was that the actions that the administration took to address some of the concerns didn’t really get at the heart of the matter. On the flip side, I can certainly understand where the Georgetown administration is coming from. … They felt they had already done enough. I can completely understand students’ concerns. I think that there was just one bridge too far that couldn’t be solved between the parties so they threw it to the Zoning Commission.
The Hoya: Which university practices are of particular concern for Burleith?
Clements: If you look at the record since even 1990 … the main concern was the sheer number of students living in the community and … [residents believed] the way to address that was to increase student housing on campus. The administration did come back with a plan using the Leavey Center to increase student beds [but] the consensus opinion was that wasn’t enough and didn’t get to a level that we as a group thought was necessary, and that was the real issue that we just couldn’t resolve.
The Hoya: Many GU students reside in Burleith. Do they play a role in the BCA at all?
Clements: Not that I know of. My experience is limited to about two months. I would certainly invite them to [participate] and I think that that would be a good thing. When I say “resident of Burleith,” I include students. I think it’s wrong to exclude them simply on the basis that they’re students. … I did the Burleith cleanup and there are students out there. That gets to one of the things I hope we can move beyond. I don’t want there to be a relationship between longtime permanent residents and students that’s an animosity type of relationship.
The Hoya: Is there always consensus among BCA leadership on issues relating to Georgetown?
Clements: I’m not sure. I definitely believe a majority of residents agree with the BCA. My impression was that the majority of residents were in favor of the position that the BCA board took. … Looking down the road — I know it’s been a long slog here — my hope is that we can take something positive … as a community because nobody’s going anywhere; 10, 20 years down the line, we’ll all still be here. My hope is we can find something constructive here because … I would like to not see our community and GU go through this again. … Perhaps I’m naive but that’s what I’d like to see.

The university plans to convert the Georgetown University Hotel & Conference Center in the LeaveyCenter into a dormitory by the fall of 2014, two years earlier than previously expected.
Administrators announced that they would expedite the project or find alternate space to house additional students in their final submission to the D.C. Zoning Commission as part of the Campus Plan process earlier this month.
According to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr, the decision to move ahead of schedule was not prompted by additional community concerns.
“When we reviewed our plans and realized that we could move faster than 2016, [we used] our final campus plan hearing to demonstrate our commitment to moving more beds on campus,” she said.
Georgetown has faced pressure from the surrounding neighborhoods to accommodate more students within the university’s gates. More than 5,000 undergraduates currently live on the main campus.
“Our position is that [we feel we] already house a higher percentage of students on campus than almost any other university,” Kerr said.
However, she added that the implementation of any project will ultimately depend upon the final ruling by the D.C. Zoning Commission. Public deliberations and a preliminary ruling will take place Feb. 9, which will allow the university to gauge interest for the renovation.
If the plan is accepted, the hotel is expected to be converted into a dormitory that would house an additional 250 beds. As of now, the university does not have any alternative student housing plans if the Zoning Commission does not approve the project.
“It’s very much in the planning stages, but we worked with an architectural firm with extensive student housing experience to determine the feasibility of the conversion and to develop a concept plan,” Kerr said.
Because the project has not yet been approved, Kerr was unable to give a potential date for the start of construction. While the dorm is slated to be completed and ready for occupancy by the fall of 2014, no details were given on which year of students the new dorm would house.
The Hoya previously reported the conversion of the hotel would cost about $8 million, which does not include the revenue lost from the discontinuation of the hotel and decreased business of the conference center.
Although the conversion plans will not be finalized for several months, students already have mixed reactions about the possible change.
“I think it’s going to be a good idea because the rooms will be so nice,” Emily Schuster (COL ’13) said. “Since it’s a hotel, it’s made for high-paying guests.”
Others, however, feel that the loss of the hotel could impact those who come to visit the school.
“My parents stay there all the time,” Hillary Heer (COL ’15) said. “I feel like it’s so much more convenient to [stay there] when you’re [visiting as] a prospective student.”

All three proposals to allocate the $3.4 million generated by the Student Activities Fee Endowment reform were passed in a student body-wide referendum Thursday night.
Voting on the three proposals opened Monday evening and closed at midnight Thursday. The Georgetown University Student Association Election Commission released the final results shortly after polls closed.
The New South Student Center proposal, which adds $2.04 million to expand plans for a student space renovation project in the lower levels of New South, was approved by 86 percent of voters. ­Eighty-seven percent of students voted in favor of the $1.25 million Student Innovation and Public Service Fund, and 90 percent approved Georgetown Energy’s proposed $250,000 allocation to install solar panels on about 43 university townhouses and establish a fund to finance sustainability projects.
The three proposals were each required to reach a 2,000-vote minimum for the election to be considered valid. All three received enough votes to cross the threshold Tuesday and had garnered over 2,500 votes by the time polls closed.
“I think it’s really exciting to see more students participating in an election,” GUSA Vice President GregLaverriere (COL ’12) said. “I think it’s a testament to the fact that it was a great proposal that students were excited to have passed.”
The implementation of each of the proposals was guaranteed through an agreement letter that GUSAsigned with the administration Monday.
Colton Malkerson (COL ’13), chair of GUSA’s Finance and Appropriations Committee, which helped finalize the proposals, said he was excited about the opportunities the proposed funding will bring.
“Three full years ago, GUSA wasn’t seen as an effective organization. I think SAFE reform has really righted the ship, essentially,” he said. “We have three really excellent proposals that will benefit student life for many years to come.”
Members of GUSA’s executive branch and senate launched a campaign last week to raise student awareness about the proposals, spreading the message through a door-knocking and social media campaign.
“Like every election, what really counts was knocking on doors, educating students about the proposals and having a strong presence on Facebook and Twitter,” Malkerson said.
