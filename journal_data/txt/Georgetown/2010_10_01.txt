The number of alcohol violations has dropped by over 50 percent over a three-year period, a statistic the administration attributes to the stricter alcohol policies implemented in 2007, which have since been a primary complaint among students.
From January to December 2009, 334 alcohol violations were reported to the Department of Public Safety, representing a 63 percent drop from the 903 violations reported in 2006.
“This downward trend may be attributed to measures that the university has taken to curtail excessive drinking, such as party registration and keg limitations,” Joseph Smith, associate director of DPS, wrote in an email.
Amendments to the alcohol policy were proposed in 2006 and went into effect in fall 2007. Students wishing to hold parties on the weekend were required to undergo mandatory training and register them by Thursday evening. Parties in townhouses and apartments were also limited to 25 to 35 people. After hefty student protests, a working group was formed and the alcohol policy was again amended in fall 2008. The current policy allows for beer pong tables, maintains the one-keg limit, facilitates party registration, clarifies the Code of Student Conduct and maintains the two-empty-container limit in alcohol-free dorms.
According to Judy Johnson, director of the Office of Student Conduct, the university makes great efforts to ensure that the campus alcohol policy is in the best interests of students.
“Over [the] years we have consulted with the community at large. We had committees that looked at the alcohol policy and [Vice President of Student Affairs] Todd Olson had town hall meetings regarding the alcohol policy,” Johnson said.
“We look at the information gathered and what other schools have. And we look at how can we match the community’s issues and preferences with a reasonable policy and then the committee members vote,” she added.
Despite the university’s efforts toward community engagement, some students who have been written up for alcohol violations have expressed dissatisfaction with the university’s current policy.
“I have a couple problems with the process, the first being that in the student code of conduct the measure for determining responsibility is `more likely than not,'” Andrew Blay (SFS ’14) said. “[It] leaves a lot of room for interpretation and bias that is present among a lot of administrators and residence hall directors, which I think is unfair to students.”
Blay was written up for an alcohol infraction on Sept. 16 when DPS knocked on his door and discovered a party inside his room. Blay is now in the process of meeting with the Office of Student Conduct and with his residence hall director to deal with the infraction.
Although he described the disciplinary process as fairly easy, Blay said he felt that administrators were often inclined to mistrust students. Students face an additional challenge this year as the Residential Judicial Council, a disciplinary body composed of students, has been put on hiatus. Students who commit violations now have to deal directly with hall directors. Blay said that this puts students at a disadvantage.
“There’s a bias and a perception that a red solo cup automatically means that you have alcohol,” he said.
The policy requires resident assistants and DPS to issue citations if students are seen in association with alcohol, even if it is clear that the students had not been drinking. The protocol can be problematic for students like Ciara Foldenauer (SFS ’14), who said she found herself in the wrong place at the wrong time.
“I walked into a room with my friends . and they had been drinking and smoking in there,” Foldenauer said. “A little while later the RA knocked on the door, came in and asked us all to turn in our GOCards. It was frustrating because I was clearly sober, but the RA is obligated to write everyone up.”
Category A violations to the Student Code of Conduct include excessive noise, possession or consumption of alcohol and possession of an unauthorized keg or alcohol related paraphernalia. These are categorized as minor infractions and are punishable by fines, work sanction hours, referral to a community resource, party restriction and possible housing relocation. Category B violations include illegal purchase of alcohol, providing alcohol to a minor and providing alcohol to an intoxicated person. These are punishable by housing relocation, housing probation or suspension and disciplinary probation or a suspension of up to two years.
“I got class A citations for alcohol in a dry dorm, possession of alcohol, consumption of alcohol, smoking indoors and a violation of quiet hours, and I had probably been there a total of 10 minutes. And that was just their policy,” Foldenauer said.
In order to clear her record, Foldenauer had to meet with her residence hall director and submit evidence and witnesses to attest to the fact that she was not drinking.
Johnson said that she did believe there has been an increase in violations this year, though she does not have statistics. The reason is unclear, as resident assistants have not increased patrols, according to Stephanie Lynch, director of residence life.
“The RAs are performing their duties and have been trained in a similar fashion to last year. They have not been asked nor are they conducting any additional rounds,” Lynch said.

An apartment in Henle Village was burglarized early Wednesday afternoon. The suspect stole a laptop and cell phone before fleeing from campus, according to a Public Safety Alert.
Two of the residents of the apartment were sitting in their living room at 12:33 p.m. when the burglar exited the apartment. After noticing the man, who neither of them knew, the residents realized that their apartment had been burglarized, and one of them chased after the suspect, according to the PSA.
The residents described the suspect as a bald black male, about 6 feet tall, with teardrop tattoos on his face and carrying a backpack. The suspect verbally threatened the resident chasing after him and then fled off campus past White-Gravenor Hall, according to the PSA. Nobody was injured in the incident.
any Henle residents said that while they did not know the specifics of the crime, it did raise concern.
“Living here, on the ground floor, I know exactly what it would be like [to be robbed]. I walked back to my apartment, and all of our blinds were up, and I could see all of our possessions. Now, I make sure all of our blinds are down all the time,” Erick Fernandez (COL ’11) said.
The burglary occurred midday, surprising Henle residents.
“It’s quite bizarre really. I mean the people were in the Henle [during the burglary] and it was in the middle of the day. Might be easy if you lived on the first floor, but not on the floors above,” Francis Leung (SFS ’13) said.
Georgetown has experienced multiple burglaries in the past year. During three consecutive weeks in August and September of this year, there were two burglaries in Burleith. In March, there was a burglary in a house one block away from campus on 36th Street, as well as an attempted burglary on 37th street. The last reported burglary on campus was in January, when burglars broke into a room in Village C West, though nothing was stolen.”

University employees discovered a possible noose hanging in a locked utility area in the sub-basement of Healy Hall earlier this week, according to a message sent to the campus community by Vice President for University Safety Rocco Del Monaco and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson on Thursday evening.
The possible noose was accompanied by racist graffiti targeting members of the black community. The graffiti was discovered in other sub-basement areas adjacent to the Healy sub-basement. The areas are off-limits but can be accessed through underground utility tunnels.
After the possible noose was discovered and reported to the Department of Public Safety on Tuesday, DPS’s investigation found that the object could not have been used for legitimate purposes by personnel. DPS concluded that the graffiti had accumulated over time but that the rope was new.
“The possibility of this kind of symbol on our campus is deeply troubling and extremely serious. We must underscore that acts of vandalism, hate and intolerance have no place in our campus community,” DelMonaco and Olson said in their message.
University response to the incident has been swift. After sending the message, DelMonaco, Olson and Vice President for Institutional Diversity and Equity Rosemary Kilkenny led a community meeting in Village C Alumni Lounge Thursday evening; about 35 administrators, faculty and students attended.
“Hanging nooses and racial slurs symbolize everything that we have worked so hard and came this far to destroy,” Carolyn Chambers (COL ’11), president of Georgetown’s chapter of the NAACP, said in an email message sent to the NAACP membership shortly after the broadcast message was sent to the university community. In her email, Chambers encouraged students to come to the meeting.
At the meeting, the administrators said that details of the incident were still unclear and that it is unknown whether the perpetrator was a student or an employee. The rationale behind the incident is also unknown, especially a s the possible noose was discovered in a location not frequented by students or employees. DPS’s investigation is ongoing, and the Metropolitan Police Department is also involved.
Olson said the administration is doing everything it can to address the problem, including creating rules and policies, sharing more information and emphasizing the importance of a culture of respect. Olson also said that the administration needs help from students, a sentiment that was echoed by students present.
“I think that administrative units that are designed to deal with these types of affairs are genuinely concerned about what is going on, but in a campus that functions very disparately in terms of different departments and student groups, it’s a very difficult task to permute the message,” Liani Balasuriya (COL ’11) said. “I hope that this incident motivates a more solidified attempt within different groups to address this as a single issue.”
Balasuriya also voiced concerns over a seeming complacency from students, as this is merely the latest in a string of bias-related incidents. Last month, several whiteboards in New South Hall and Darnall Hall were defaced with drawings of swastikas and the name “Hitler.” Two incidents featuring Nazi graffiti also occurred in spring 2009.
“[Because there have been multiple incidents], people are feeling numb,” Shiva Subbaraman, director of the LGBTQ Resource Center, said.”

The university has lost over $1 million from the Federal Work-Study Program this year leading to a decrease of 946 awards in funds available for students this year.
Current funding for Georgetown’s Federal Work-Study Program has decreased from $4,545,282 for the 2009-2010 school year, to $3,345,308 for the 2010-2011 school year, according to the U.S. Department of Education’s Information for Financial Aid Professionals website. This constitutes a 26.4 percent drop in total federal work-study funding from the previous academic year.
Employing hundreds of students at Georgetown, federal work-study is a major factor in many students’ need-based financial aid packages; participants’ expected earnings are included in the aid arrangements.
The decrease accounts for a loss of 946 awards from the Department of Education, according to the website, from 2,983 to 2,037.
A significant amount of the loss of funds can be attributed to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. According to the Department of Education, Georgetown received $793,800 from the Recovery Act for the Federal Work-Study Program in 2009-2010. Georgetown has not received funds from the stimulus act since May 2010, according to ProPublica, an online collection of public records. This year’s lack of stimulus funds accounts for the majority of the gap between the two school years. The administration does not view the loss of funds as entirely negative, however.
“Thanks to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, we had a one-time increase in our Federal Work-Study allocation last year, but we will not be adversely affected by the return to our typical allocation this year,” university spokeswoman Julie Bataille wrote in an email.
Bataille said that the loss of funds would not affect the number of jobs provided to Georgetown students.
“We have sufficient funding to offer federal work-study this year to any student who is eligible to receive the aid,” Bataille said.
Students have begun to feel the effects of the purse-tightening in their on-campus jobs. Dan Galloway (SFS ’13) noted that the salary for his on-campus work-study job was cut in half this year due to a lack of funds, even though he received a promotion this year.
The Office of Student Financial Services declined to comment.”

Almost all of the guns used in crimes in D.C. are imported from other states, a new report says, with Maryland and Virginia as the chief exporters.
The report, published on Sept. 27 by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition of mayors founded by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, states that 98.2 percent of the guns collected from crime scenes in the District originated in other states. Overall, the D.C. police departments recovered 2,321 guns in 2009.
Virginia exported the most guns – 265 of those recovered last year – to Washington, D.C. Maryland, the other state bordering the District, was the second-highest exporter of guns to D.C., with 247 of guns recovered originally sold in Maryland. Virginia also served as the largest exporter of guns to Maryland, having sold to Maryland over 400 guns – almost one-fourth the total number of guns brought into the state.
The report argues that states with more lenient gun-control laws exported many of their guns to states with stricter gun- ontrol laws, undermining the efforts of the stricter states. Virginia has laws addressing only four of the 10 issues that the coalition used as criteria for judging gun-control. In contrast, Maryland has laws addressing nine of the 10 issues, but these have not been effective at stopping illegal gun trafficking into the District.
D.C. has stricter gun laws; it instituted a ban on the ownership of handguns in 1975. The ban was enforced until it was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Court of Appeals for D.C. in 2007, and then the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008. The District’s current laws mandate that all guns must be registered, as well as ban assault weapons and large-capacity bullet feeding
devices.
Second Amendment rights have remained a contentious issue in D.C. In April, two pro-gun rallies occurred in the area, one taking place at the Washington Monument, and the other at Gravelly Point National Park in Virginia. These newest revelations on the amount of illegal guns in the District may well spark more debates.

Three weeks ago, Honest Abe watched as Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin led a Tea Party protest on the steps of his Lincoln Memorial. On Saturday, he got to watch another.
The One Nation “March on DC” gathered at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial in support of “jobs, justice and education.” The rally was meant to represent the opinions of the American majority, though it garnered most of its support from minority groups including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Urban League and the American Federation of Teachers.
The crowd began gathering at the Lincoln Memorial at 6 a.m., and by noon the Mall was covered with people wearing stickers exclaiming “Jobs Not War” or “Change Today.” Organization leaders said that over 100,000 activists attended the march.
Though the event was not meant to directly address the recent Tea Party protests, it did seek to balance out media coverage of conservative opinions with an alternative viewpoint.
“We’re not a response to the Tea Party,” said NAACP president Benjamin Jealous in an interview with ABC News. “If anything, we’re the antidote. We are a different response to the same moment. They have sought to attack diversity . We say, `Don’t push down on diversity, push up on prosperity.'”
Though supporters marched for issues ranging from gay marriage to environmental preservation, it was clear that jobs were the focal point of the rally. Organization leaders were pleased by the unity among participants, maintaining that political victory can be achieved only if activists remain unified.
“We have been victorious whenever we worked together,” One Nation wrote on its website. “We have proven the only thing we need to succeed is each other.”
any speakers, such as Ed Schultz of MSNBC’s “The Ed Show,” provided assurances of the power of unity.
“We are together,” Schultz said. “This march is about the power to the people.”
Though the march leaders seemed to exude political confidence, some marchers questioned the usefulness of the event.
“To be honest, I don’t even know why I’m here,” said Mike Arroyo, a member of the D.C.-based Transport Workers Union. “I’m an accountant in the office of the union, and they just asked me to come and help out. All I know is that I moved here from Brooklyn for this union, and I believe in this cause. I don’t know how or if it will help, but it’s the best we can do.”
ark Harrington, who is a member of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, seemed much more assured.
“We will be remembered,” he said. “My motivation is to express my feelings and concerns for the current situation and economy. What else can I do to try and have my voice heard?”
After the crowds had departed at the end of the day, forgotten water bottles littered the ground along with posters saying “What do YOU think?” or “One voice can change the world.”

World Bank Group President Robert Zoellick unveiled a new research plan and slogan for the World Bank in Gaston Hall on Wednesday morning before an audience of students and faculty.
School of Foreign Service Dean Carol Lancaster introduced Zoellick to a less-than-full Gaston, though more students trickled in throughout the lecture.
In her introduction, Lancaster noted the importance of Zoellick’s role in world affairs, especially in the buildup to the World Bank meetings set to take place in Washington, D.C., Oct. 8 to 10.
The World Bank, according to its mission statement, seeks to reduce poverty worldwide by furthering what their website characterizes as sustainable and inclusive globalization.
Zoellick invoked George Bernard Shaw, playwright and co-founder of the London School of Economics, at the outset of his speech. “If all economists were laid end to end, they would not reach a conclusion,” he quipped.
“Economics has contributed significantly to how we understand our world,” Zoellick said. “But economics doesn’t always get it right.”
Zoellick emphasized the need for a global economic dialogue.
“One of the things we’re trying to do more broadly at the [World] Bank is capture [much] of the knowledge and experiences we have from people in the developed world but broaden the set of people asking these questions and how we think about them,” Zoellick said.
He added that he believed the need for an economic agenda that includes the input of people from across the globe was accentuated by the pressures of today’s economic crises.
“Indeed, [economics] can get things spectacularly wrong,” he said, pointing to the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis as an example of just how flawed economics with a limited scope can be.
Zoellick framed his argument and the basis of the World Bank’s new strategy in the history of development economics and its recent failures, which he attributed to too narrow a focus in the field.
For example, he said, in the 1950s,
economists believed that all emerging markets needed was an injection of capital and even today, China and India have serious concerns regarding agriculture and infrastructure even though they are becoming market leaders. He also cited the likely failure to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, quantitative measures adopted by world leaders in 2000 to eradicate world poverty by 2015.
These shortcomings, Zoellick said, require a radical re-examination of some of the most basic principles of development economics, including a better understanding of “economic transformation,” a push for inclusive development, and a comprehensive plan to deal with economic risks.
The speech also revealed a new slogan for the World Bank’s research: “Open Data, Open Knowledge, Open Solutions.”
The bespectacled Zoellick became markedly more animated after he had finished his prepared remarks, and he responded first to a question from Lancaster about the “revolutionary” nature of his speech, which advocated a fundamentally different and ostensibly controversial open-source approach to developmental economics.”

iPhones were the primary targets in a string of robberies that occurred in the Georgetown area last weekend.
Residents reported their iPhones were stolen from them as they were walking down the street, with at least one victim suffering severe injuries. The series of crimes has led local authorities to caution iPhone users from displaying their pricey gadgets.
The weekend’s thefts took place on the 1400 block of 31st Street, the corner of 29th and R Street, and on the 1500 block of 19th Street, off Dupont Circle.
Two additional similar incidents occurred on Sept. 22 and 24 at 21st and P Streets, according to an email from Metropolitan Police Department Commander Matthew Klein. In these two instances, Klein said the robberies were reported to be executed in similar manners.
“In both cases, the suspect approached the victims and engaged them in conversation before snatching their iPhones and running away,” Klein said. “During the robbery last night, the suspect asked the victim if he could use the phone to make a call, but when the victim offered to dial for him, he snatched the phone and ran.”
Department of Public Safety Associate Director Joseph Smith said he saw a clear motive in the robberies.
“iPhones have become very popular of late – a cultural icon – and there is a high perceived value of them,” Smith wrote in an email. “In a perfect world, we should be able to stroll down the road without fear of such victimization. But this is the stark reality, and we must prepare accordingly.”
Smith said that DPS has increased its presence along the campus periphery with foot, bicycle and car patrols, and has partnered with Residence Life, Student Affairs, Georgetown University Student Association, the Student Safety Advisory Board and others to increase communication about public safety to students.
Commissioner Ed Solomon, chair of the safety committee of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission2E, said the ANC also held a safety committee meeting about the situation.
“We had [the meeting] to make sure that MPD is applying as many resources as possible,” Solomon said. “The MPD is taking this very seriously.”
Klein informed the community about the Sept. 22 and 24 thefts and warned pedestrians to be cautious while walking at night. He said that police officers are currently working to follow leads, and that the crimes may be connected. The suspect in both cases is described as a black male of medium height.
In response to the incidents, Smith advised students to stay cognizant of their surroundings.
“A good part of this awareness is not having divided attention. Take the earphones out of your iPhones and keep [it] out of sight,” he said. “Criminals must have some indication that you possess an iPhone to target you for it, so not having any overt visual cues for them to pick up on is a good start.”
Smith also advised students to walk in pairs or groups and to find a location that provides a degree of safety and is not obviously visible from the street if a student must use his or her iPhone.
iPhone owner Katie Rigby (COL ’12) said she has been exercising extra caution in the wake of these incidents.
“Since I heard about the thefts of iPhones in the area I have stopped walking around with my phone visible,” Rigby said. “I try not to make calls or text if I am walking by myself.”

Last weekend, visitors to the National Mall had the chance to peruse books and meet authors from across the country, as the National Book Festival celebrated its 10th anniversary.
This year’s gathering, entitled “Celebrating a Decade of Words and Wonder,” brought more than 70 of the country’s top writers and illustrators from a wide range of literary genres and styles together on the Mall.
According to estimates by the Library of Congress, which runs the event, more than 150,000 people convened on the Mall on Saturday. The high attendance rate was particularly noteworthy due to the stifling temperature in D.C. on Saturday, which stayed above 90 degrees for much of the day, according to The Washington Post.
Former first lady Laura Bush, who was a speaker on Saturday, collaborated with the Library of Congress to launch the very first festival back in 2001.
any of the authors, including Isabel Allende, Michele Norris, Spike Mendelsohn of “Top Chef”, and first lady Michelle Obama’s brother, Craig Robinson, spoke and held book signings throughout the daylong event.
The event catered to readers of all ages, with numerous set ups geared towardskids and young adults while other events featured venerated authors of poetry and prose.
All 50 states, as well as Washington, D.C., had tables displaying information about their individual literary heritage and upcoming local events.
But while most of the tents featured speakers and information, books actually for sale were limited.
“I found few books actually for sale, which is the main reason I came to the festival,” Cooper Dukes (MSB ’12) said, “The books were only located in one tent and the selection was very sparse.”
Among the books for sale was The Congressional Club’s Cookbook, a non partisan collection of recipes and techniques written by the spouses of congressmen and senators, which was on sale for $53 a piece. Unfortunately for festival-goers, there were no free samples.

Students and faculty of the McDonough School of Business made their voices – and cowbells – heard on Wall Street as they sounded the New York Stock Exchange’s closing bell from the Hilltop on Tuesday.
The event, which occurred in the lobby of the Rafik B. Hariri Building, was streamed live onto the trading floor in New York, where brokers were pleased to see the day end with many of the major indexes looking up.
Following the closing, students were invited to a panel discussion sponsored by the Financial Times on the role of capital markets in job creation. The panel, which was led by Financial Times U.S. Managing Editor Gillian Tett, featured representatives from the Federal Reserve, the NYSE and the MSB as well as the Chief Executive Officers of both Rosetta Stone and Under Armour.
Though panelists covered a broad range of topics, the focal points of discussion were the benefits of going public as a company and the role of the federal government in the private financial sector. Lawrence Leibowitz, Chief Operating Officer of the NYSE’s Euronext initiative, kicked off the dialogue by stressing the importance of public trading for business expansion.
“Companies on the NYSE represent about 35 million jobs,” he said. “The truth is that businesses need access to capital markets to start their companies and to start expanding.”
Tom Adams, president and CEO of Rosetta Stone, and Kevin Plank, founder and CEO of Under Armour, confirmed Leibowitz’s remarks with their own stories of company growth. Adams especially outlined the benefits of public trading in creating more capital.
“Before we went public, all the cash we were creating, we were using. We were basically self-funding, so you don’t think as long term,” Adams said.
Going public, or offering company shares for purchase, can be beneficial, but as panelists observed, it can also be difficult in times of economic distress. Because of the recent recession, buyers have been reluctant to invest. Public companies have taken hits to their share prices and ultimately to their profits, which means job losses, said the panelists.
According to Plank, his key to continuing success was perseverance through stock market valleys. Presenting himself as somewhat of a market gladiator, he told listeners that he refused to allow his employees to fall into negativity despite the harsh economic realities that the company faced.
“I told our company as the markets continued to drop, `We are no longer participating in loser talk,'” he said.
Fortunately for the audience, Plank’s “loser talk” was not a pronounced feature of Tuesday’s panel either. Panelists presented positive solutions to market struggles and encouraged entrepreneurs to go forward with their aspirations in spite of the economic climate.
“Entrepreneurship is what made and built America,” Plank said. “I think that’s one of the ideas that needs to be sold by this [presidential] administration.”
For many students, the panel discussion was a wave of assurance and inspiration amid a sea of troubles that include foreign currency manipulation and struggling banks. As for the panel itself, the students said they were impressed by the array of speakers and opinions available to them.
“It was awesome,” graduate student Chelsea Tucker said. “The combination of real entrepreneurs with government people and policy people and professors is phenomenal for a business student. That was probably the best panel I’ve ever been to.”
According to Chris Kormis, associate dean of marketing and communications, the closing bell ceremony and panel discussion were both held at the suggestion of the NYSE, who contacted the school to propose the event.
“They had seen the list of the distinguished speakers on our website, and they were impressed, and so they called us up and suggested it,” Kormis said.
The university is also currently discussing another partnership with the Financial Times later this year, though Kormis said that it is too early to announce the details.

The eighth annual R U Ready? event paved the way for an increased dialogue on sexual assault Thursday night in Copley Formal Lounge.
ore than 100 students and faculty members attended the event, which aimed to provide an educated discourse for sexual assault on campus.
Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN) reports that every two minutes someone in the United States is sexually assaulted, and that college-age women are four times more likely to be victims of assault.
“The statistics are more alarming when they are broken down,” said Stacey Lantz, a survivor of sexual assault and the guest speaker for the event. “Women of color are more likely to be assaulted. People who are or are even perceived to be in the sexual minority are more likely to be assaulted.”
Shiva Subbaraman, director of the LGBTQ Resource Center, explained that sexual assault is an issue that extends beyond violence against women.
“Sexual assault and gender violence happens in every community, and within the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual community, there is a lot of [same-sex] violence,” Subbaraman said. “I think when people think of sexual assault, they only think of it in the heterosexual context, but there is a lot of same-sex violence.”
Rehana Mohammed (SFS ’12), a student facilitator, said she felt that the event was important because the topic of sexual violence is often considered a taboo subject in society.
“It’s hard to talk about,” Mohammed said. “It hurts to talk about. It’s scary to talk about. Since it’s such a problem on college campuses, we need to talk about it.”
The purpose of the event is to get people to raise their voices on these issues.
“It’s important because I feel like it’s an issue that is rarely discussed,” Brittanie Leibold (COL ’13) said. “We live in a culture of victim-blaming and it’s just tragic to me that when girls experience sexual assault, they blame themselves. . The responsibility always [lies] with the perpetrator, and that’s something victims of sexual assault and violence need to always remember. Victim-blaming is not tolerated.”
Dan Porterfield (COL ’83), senior vice president for strategic development, said that students and faculty can help create a safer Georgetown by taking safety seriously, being aware of the risks students face and elevating safety issues in campus discourse.
“As a new school year begins it’s very important that students inform themselves about the risks of sexual assault on college campuses, the prevention strategies that can work, and the importance of supporting survivors,” Porterfield said. “While these topics are complex and painful, and not easy to talk about, R U Ready? is structured to help students learn together in a comfortable setting.”
The discussion also stressed the role men could have in preventing and educating others about sexual assault.
“All men are definitely not at fault, and that assumption should never be made,” Saaliha Khan (COL ’13), a student facilitator said. “In general both men and women should be very aware of this reality and be conscious of it. The sad part is a lot of the time the sexual assault usually happens to people by someone they know, and when you think about that, it kind of blows your mind.”
Porterfield said that there is a lot men can do and are doing.
“We can inform ourselves about the risks,” Porterfield said. “We can avoid sexist language. We can promote safety by offering to escort friends home. We can watch out for friends at parties. We can call out predatory behavior and treat women with respect. And we can come together for discussion with women about other practical steps we can take.”
Lantz explained in her survival story that the effects of sexual assault stay with the survivor for a lifetime, but said it is times like these when her words become words of empowerment.
“I don’t believe the path to recovery ever ends,” Lantz said. “The experience of rape and sexual assault never goes away. . The ability to use my voice for education and to encourage discussions of rape and sexual assault give me the power over my perpetrator as their actions will never fade silently into the background.”
Lantz pointed out that statistically speaking, one in four women in the room will be victimized by sexual assault, and even more know survivors of assault.
For Kahn, growing up in Southern California allowed her to see firsthand the effects of this reality.
“Going to high school in [Los Angeles], I remember hearing cases about girls who got raped in my area and it would just break my heart, and I wondered what I could do about it. I wanted to help make a difference, I wanted to bring about awareness,” Kahn said.
[Sexual assault] is something that we as a society need to address and help combat. That’s why I decided to do R U Ready? because I am ready to make a difference.”

Members of the Appalachia Rising movement convened in the Leavey Center for their first annual “Voices From the Mountains” summit, gathering professors, doctors, environmentalists, NASA climate scientists, students, and miners for the three-day event.
The largest national movement of its kind, Appalachia Rising advocates for an end to Mountaintop Removal (MTR) mining, a method of coal extraction achieved by blasting off the tops of mountain ridges in order to access and harvest the underlying coal seams.
While some praise the extraction technique on the basis of its expediency and fiscal benefits, the Appalachia Rising movement seeks to raise awareness of the environmental devastation it has wreaked on communities from North Carolina to Kentucky to Tennessee.
The three days of summit workshops, lectures, and seminars culminated in a day of lobbying on Capitol Hill and a march 2,000 strong on the National Mall.
Since the 1960s, MTR has offered an alternative to traditional underground `shaft’ mining techniques, which involve tunneling into the side of the mountain to harvest a particular coal seam while leaving the soil, wildlife and plants above it intact.
Conversely, MTR results in deforestation and the dumping of excess debris into surrounding valleys, which in turn pollutes the water supply.
These devastating health and environmental impacts were points of great concern to Georgetown students who attended the summit.
“I had no idea how dangerous MTR really was,” Ursela Groat (SFS ’11) said. ” I didn’t realize that it was literally destroying our water supply.”
Summit participants also learned about the effects of the coal mining industry on Appalachian residents. Attendees were also provided with nonviolent action and lobbying trainings in which participants learned how to best advocate for their cause with Congressional Staff and what to do in the event of their arrest during Monday’s march.
Georgetown Professor and longtime nonviolent activist Barbara Wien participated in the movement’s efforts to lobby Congress and raise public awareness, as well as attending last weekend’s on-campus events. Wien, who teaches a seminar on nonviolence theory and practice here on the Hilltop, emphasized the importance of Georgetown students being exposed to and participating in peaceful action.
“Nonviolence is a proud, formative part of American history from William Penn to the Boston Tea Party” said Wien, who praised events like the Appalachia Rising conference for their ability to help students enhance, improve, and guide peaceful discourse into the future.
any students from Georgetown and other regional universities also took advantage of the opportunity to engage in nonviolence by attending the conference, marches, and lobbying events.
“Voices From the Mountains fits in well with Georgetown’s mission and dedication to social justice work,” Groat said.
Wien echoed her sentiment saying, “It’s critical to ground this nonviolent struggle in fact, scholarship and science and [Georgetown’s] involvement allows higher education to be brought to bear on this issue.”
