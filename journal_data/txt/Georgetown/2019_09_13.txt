The Georgetown University Student Association senate is considering proposals to abolish the GUSA Fund, which reallocates part of the student activities fee to clubs requesting additional funding. 
The GUSA Fund is intended to provide ad hoc funding for university-recognized clubs and organizations seeking to fund activities and events. The fund reallocates thousands of dollars from the student activities fee to student organizations who fill out a request form throughout the year as they need funding, according to the GUSA website. The fund’s resources are determined by the GUSA executive’s discretionary funds, which change annually based on finance and appropriations committee deliberations. 
But the fund has historically failed to fulfill its original mission and misappropriated funds, according to GUSA senators seeking to abolish it.
The GUSA Fund has facilitated funding for student groups who did not receive money from the Student Activities Commission for rightful disciplinary or logistic reasons, according to Harrison Nugent (SFS ’20), who was elected the new GUSA senate transition finance and appropriation chair in a 10-to-7 vote at the weekly GUSA meeting this Sunday. 
“In previous years, the account has been mismanaged by the executive and has been used as a workaround to SAC for clubs that are either on probation or should be going through new club development,” Nugent wrote in an email to The Hoya.
 
The GUSA FinApp committee, composed of 12 senators, annually allocates the student activities fee to the GUSA executive and other groups including six advisory boards — like the SAC —  Georgetown Program Board, the Georgetown University Lecture Fund and other applicants. 
Five students appointed by the GUSA executive and approved by the GUSA senate govern the GUSA Fund. The fund stipulates minimum levels of funding for diversity-related events, civic engagement and the arts. However, the majority of the fund is unassigned, allowing for discretion by the committee throughout the year, according to the GUSA website. 
GUSA President Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20) and Vice President Aleida Olvera (COL ’20) oppose abolishing the GUSA Fund because the majority of organizations served by the fund last year catered to women and minority student organizations, according to Olvera. 
“Norman and I believe that abolishing GUSA Fund is a direct attack on student groups who serve underrepresented populations, since they make up the majority of GUSA Fund’s recipients,” Olvera wrote in an email to The Hoya. “GUSA is meant to serve all students, and it disappoints us that they would want to take this opportunity away from communities that are already lacking in proper resources.”
But the fund has failed to provide all student groups the support they need and should reallocate the resources to clubs directly, rather than through GUSA Fund, according to Nugent. 
“I believe that it is our duty as senators to represent student interests above our own, and the money that will be saved by abolishing GUSA Fund will ultimately be reallocated to the student clubs we know and love,” Nugent wrote. 
Former Transition FinApp Chair Matthew Buckwald (COL ’20), whose resignation from his position in the senate was announced Aug. 30, formally introduced legislation to amend the GUSA bylaws to abolish the GUSA Fund on Aug. 29. 
“The GUSA Finance & Appropriations committee is tasked with ensuring that student funds are responsibly appropriated to enhance student activities,” the act said. “The GUSA Fund has not sufficiently provided responsible monetary support to student activities.”
The conversation around the GUSA Fund’s abolition has been ongoing for years but has been especially prominent in recent months, according to Senator Samuel Dubke (SFS ’21), who ran against Nugent for transition FinApp chair. 
While the fund’s many flaws should be addressed, its principles should be preserved and reformed, according to Dubke. 
“In the past, this fund has been misused, by providing money to groups that did not need it, and by lacking clear regulations or oversight,” Dubke wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Nevertheless, the core value behind GUSA Fund – that we should be able to help those organizations that slip through the cracks of advisory boards’ stringent regulations – remains relevant.”
Though the GUSA Fund members are officially approved by the executive branch, the senate should increase their attention to the fund, according to Dubke. 
“The Senate, which has allocated millions of dollars for years through the Finance and Appropriations Committee, should have much greater oversight over GUSA Fund,” Dubke wrote. “The fund’s charter should be rewritten, and new, reformed-minded leadership should take over.”
The GUSA senate intends to vote on the GUSA Fund’s proposed abolition in upcoming meetings, according to Nugent. If the senate does pass a proposal to abolish the fund in coming weeks, the executive will challenge the legislation, according to Olvera.
“I’m not sure why this is a controversial/divisive issue within GUSA, but if the Senate were to advocate for the abolishment of this fund Norman and I are prepared to fight against it,” Olvera wrote.

Glover Park residents are pushing for the Washington, D.C. Department of Parks and Recreation to renege a contract with a prestigious D.C. private school after pushback from parents of public school students who also utilize the space.
The newly renewed contract, which was first negotiated in 2009, grants the Maret School privileged access to Jelleff Field, a public sports field in Glover Park across from Hardy Middle School, for the next nine years. Maret has had exclusive access to Jelleff during primetime after-school hours since paying into a $2.4 million agreement with DPR in 2009, under the condition that the school would pay to improve Jelleff’s facilities. In response to disagreements over use of field space and field maintenance, an online petition emerged three weeks ago calling for the nullification of a contract renewal between Maret and DPR. 
Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E Commissioners Elizabeth Miller, Kishan Putta and Joe Gibbons met with Mayor Muriel Bowser (D), DPR Director Delano Hunter and Deputy Mayor for Education Paul Kihn on Wednesday night to discuss the status of the contract. Bowser called the meeting in response to the petition, according to Putta, which garnered 2,400 signatures as of Thursday afternoon.
The $950,000 contract renewal, which extends the agreement for another nine years, has come under fire for pitting private school children’s interests against those of public school children, Putta said. 
“We explained that every day over 100 kids in the free Jelleff after-school program can’t play on the reserved field and they have to hang out in the basement instead,” Putta said in an interview with The Hoya. “This deal is a terrible lesson for our children. We should be teaching them that sharing high-demand public resources is important and that all children deserve them.”
At the meeting, Bowser said her office would reconsider the contract, according to Putta. 
Maret, which is located away from Glover Park in Woodley Park, argues its partnership with DPR has actually benefited the wider community. Maret deserves credit for improving Jelleff by building new lights, a new pool and new turf since 2009, according to Maret Director of Communications Linda Johnson. 
Maret is also attempting to correct misconceptions about the demographics of its school and the students it serves, according to Johnson. 
“It’s important to get the facts straight because there’s a lot of misinformation going around,” Johnson said in an interview with The Hoya. “There isn’t just one type of student that goes to our school. One in four of our students receives financial aid. We are committed to equity and our partnerships, and we think Jelleff is one and it is benefiting the city.”
Other parents have claimed that, though the agreement requires Maret to maintain and update the field, the school has not upheld its end of the deal. Martin Welles (LAW ’09), vice president of Hardy’s Parent Teacher Organization and father of three Hardy students, provided The Hoya with a June 2019 report from Leading Design & Development Sports, which tests sports fields for safety standards. The report shows Jelleff Field is out of compliance for shock absorption regulations in the field, important for contact sports.
The report demonstrates that Maret neglected to maintain safety standards for the field; this shortcoming stands as a reason not to extend the agreement, according to Welles.
“Maret was responsible for the upkeep of the field and they let it deteriorate,” Welles wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Parent-teacher organizations at Hardy and other public schools in the area, along with ANC Commissioners from Wards 2 and 3, wrote a letter to D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine asking his office to investigate the now 19-year no-bid contract between Maret and DPR, according to an email obtained by The Hoya.
When the contract was originally negotiated, the city did not have enough funds to renovate Jelleff on its own, leading to the agreement with Maret, according to an email D.C. Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) sent to residents of Burleith, which borders Glover Park, on Wednesday.
“DC’s DPR entered into a public-private partnership with Maret that would preserve the field,” Evans wrote in the email. “I approached other schools and entities to partner on the renovations; no one else was interested.”
Maret originally wanted a 20-year contract deal but reached a compromise with DPR, receiving preferred permitting for 10 years first and then an additional 10 if they followed through on improvements to the field. This year, Maret renewed its contract before it was set to expire in June 2020, creating a 19-year agreement. 
Maret has invested enough money to earn the second decade, according to Evans.
“A compromise was reached where the city agreed to extend the relationship for an additional 10 years, if Maret delivered on the terms of the contract in the first 10 years,” he wrote. “Maret has lived up to their end of the agreement. When Maret approached DPR to extend the agreement, per the original terms, they offered to invest an additional $1 million in the field, and in improvements to the clubhouse.”
DPR had purchased Jelleff for $20 million from the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Washington in 2010 after the organization fell into financial trouble during the 2008 recession. However, this purchase left no money for renovation, and the city needed an outside contractor to renovate Jelleff on behalf of DPR, according to Evans’ email.
D.C. Councilmembers Elissa Silverman (I-At Large) and Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3) expressed support for making Jelleff fully public. The council may hold a hearing on the issue soon, according to Putta. 
But the children currently prohibited from using the field after school bear the real cost, Putta said.
“For one school to get all of those hours for 10 years was bad enough,” Putta said. “And for them to extend it for another decade is really a slap in the face.”

Five hundred feet from the port that carried members of the 272 enslaved people sold by the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus in 1838 to financially sustain Georgetown University, plans for redevelopment of the Wharf have lined the southwest Washington, D.C. waterfront with new restaurants, shops and apartment complexes.
While plans to construct commercial establishments and residential buildings are already more than halfway completed, designs to examine and remember the history of the former slave depot have also emerged. From explicit references to a failed escape attempt by enslaved people to restaurants that draw influence from cultures touched by the Atlantic slave trade, the Wharf’s development is attempting to walk the line between acknowledging the past and giving new signifiance to historic spaces. 
Reconnecting With the Past
Nearly 200 years after the members of the 272 enslaved people sold by the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus in 1838 to financially sustain Georgetown set sail from the D.C. wharf, community members and those involved in the site’s redevelopment are taking steps to acknowledge the Wharf’s complex and dark history with slavery. 
The Wharf finished Phase 1 of its development Oct. 12, 2017, in which 900 residential units were built, estimating to hold 2,000 people, according to WTOP. Phase 2 of the Wharf’s development began in March and is set to finish in 2022. The plans include an additional 1.25 million square feet of hotel, residential and office space, according to the Wharf’s website. 
As a part of the redevelopment process, the Wharf worked alongside a committee of volunteers created by the Advisory Neighborhood Commission to identify important aspects of history to consolidate into medallions to be displayed on the boardwalk. 
The purpose of this project was to inspire curiosity in visitors, according to Emily Eig, an architectural historian and preservation specialist who conducted most of the historical research on the Wharf. 
“It was the idea that it’s a little tidbit that you can take and go, ‘Hmm, I’m interested in that,’” Eig said. “That might come up just by reading two sentences, or a long sentence, and that’s kind of an exciting project, really making accessible history.” 
Outside the Wharf’s institutionalized development efforts, however, chef Kwame Onwuachi opened new restaurant Kith and Kin in 2017 in hopes to recognize the complex legacies of the Atlantic and domestic slave trade.
The restaurant is located within InterContinental D.C. and tells a story through its menu that stands in stark contrast to that of the modern glass buildings and upscale shops that surround the newly developed Wharf. Founder Onwuachi created the restaurant to serve homestyle Afro-Carribean food to honor his diverse heritage and the complex and dark history of the District’s waterfront regarding to slavery.
Onwuachi, who is of Nigerian, Jamaican, West African and Caribbean heritage, grew up in the Bronx but lived with his relatives in Nigeria for two years during his childhood. When Onwuachi got an offer to run a restaurant inside the InterContinental, he became inspired by his family legacy as well as the Wharf’s history, according to The New York Times. 
“I could either do an elaborate tasting menu or I could do something to honor my ancestors,” Onwuachi said in an interview with The New York Times. “I hadn’t seen anything representing them in that vein — a place to celebrate our food while celebrating a special occasion.”
Beyond intentionally centering ancestral influences within Kith and Kin’s cuisine, Onwuachi has actively highlighted Kith and Kin’s historical connections to the domestic slave trade and invoked the memory of the GU272. 
“272 slaves were sold to save Georgetown University from bankruptcy in the 1800s, and the community was ripped apart. The ship would have left from where Kith/Kin is today,” Onwuachi wrote in a Facebook post. “Slavery is not our history. It is the disruption of our history. That’s what Kith/Kin is about.”
Though efforts in the Wharf to acknowledge the site’s complicated history are important, a more active analysis is necessary to make meaningful progress, Maya Moretta (COL ’21), a member of the GU272 Advocacy Team, said. (Full Disclosure: Maya Moretta is a former member of the editorial board)
“I think it’s a great first step, but I hope that everybody can begin to think more critically about the legacies of slavery, not just in the historical lens but also making connections to all of the capital and wealth we have now,” Moretta said.
A Profitable History
From the District’s Wharf, many of the 272 enslaved people sold by the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus left the nation’s capital for the Deep South, where many descendants still reside today in Maringouin, La. Though the Wharf played a central role in facilitating the sale and transport of these people, the location’s legacy as a hub of the domestic slave trade is not always so quickly remembered. 
In the 19th century, the District became a center of domestic slave trade, with the Wharf being one of the most active depots of the nation. Nestled between slaveholding states Virginia and Maryland, the District facilitated the sale of people in the Chesapeake Bay Region and the Deep South, which saw an increasing demand from the production of cotton.
In 1800, for every one free black resident, four enslaved people lived in the capital, and, by 1820, approximately 6,400 slaves inhabited the District. Enslaved African Americans built some of the Wharf’s original infrastructure and worked at the tobacco plantations along the riverside.
However, many enslaved people also used the Wharf as a means to escape to Pennsylvania or New Jersey, according to WAMU. Among these slaves were 77 people who attempted to escape on a ship called Pearl. The attempt, while unsuccessful, helped spur protests which led to the Compromise of 1850, ending the slave trade in D.C. 
Though establishments like Kith and Kin are attracting attention to the Wharf’s historical ties to the domestic and Atlantic slave trade, the redevelopment of the Wharf has contributed to displacement of local communities.
Gentrification and development has displaced thousands in the District, and this displacement is occurring at the highest rates in Ward 6, where the Wharf is located. In some Ward 6 neighborhoods, low-income residents have decreased from being over 70% of the neighborhood makeup to nearly 20% percent. 
While the Wharf has attempted to discuss slavery as part of its history, the redevelopment plan did not include any plans to erect a memorial recognizing its role in perpetuating slavery, according to Eig.
Preserving Cultural Memory
A complicated history also makes the process of remembrance more complex, as there is no one way to tell the whole story. Segregation and racism have prevented the public construction of a generational memory of slavery, imbuing cultural artifacts with great significance, said Eric Langenbacher, a Georgetown professor who teaches a proseminar called “Politics and Memory” in the School of Foreign Service.  
“The memory of slavery and its effects is almost like a kind of cultural memory from the get-go in this country,” Langenbacher said in an interview with The Hoya. “[This] means that … those external raw materials that have to do with the food, memorials, documents, testimonies that exist are going to be all the more important, because we don’t have people with actual real experiences to help to construct that memory to it.” 
By honoring the legacy of Onwuachi’s heritage, which is rooted in the African diaspora, Kith and Kin is one example of an attempt to preserve cultural memory and recognize the history of slavery in the Wharf area. 
Though Onwuachi chooses to preserve the historical legacy of those sold in the Atlantic and domestic slave trade through food, Georgetown students have pursued other avenues to remember the enslaved perople shipped from the Wharf, whose suffering has benefited and continues to benefit countless students. 
Artwork dedicated to the GU272 and student-led outreach trips to descendant communities are a few of the ways students have grappled with the legacy of slavery. The GU272 Advocacy Team has been a proponent of student organizing on campus, from leading community organizing events and educating students on the ways the 272 enslaved people have impacted Georgetown’s campus to drafting the referendum on the reconciliation fee that students voted on in April.
However, the 1838 sale is not the only instance that the university has benefited from the institution of slavery, and students should not limit their memory and focus to just one instance, Moretta said.
“Almost every building that was built before 1860 on Georgetown’s campus and in the neighborhood was built because of the institution of slavery,” Moretta said. “Buildings that we still currently inhabit and purchase coffee from are places where extreme violence and trauma occurred.”
Although the fee is a heroic effort, it can never truly make amends for Georgetown’s actions, Langenbacher said.
“All efforts will always be inadequate given the severity of the crimes, but any effort is better than no effort at all, because you’re at least hopefully achieving a semblance of healing,” Langenbacher said.

Extensive renovations to the Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching and Service’s home in Poulton Hall will be completed in October, providing expanded space for CSJ programs and staff. 
Once limited to a central room with offices lining its perimeter, the addition will add meeting rooms and offices for both the CSJ and justice and peace studies faculty, who will now have dedicated office space, according to CSJ Associate Director Ray Shiu. The building’s former UPS store, which closed in 2017 and faced 37th Street, will be fully incorporated into the building. The ribbon cutting ceremony Oct. 25 will be during the CSJ’s Education for Liberation Week, marking the developments and challenges in the field. 
The CSJ is a collection of education, research and service programs intended to further social justice in the community. Founded in 2001, it was originally located in St. Mary’s Hall. The CSJ moved to Poulton Hall not long after its creation, and although minor updates have been made in the years since, the current construction is the first major renovation, Shiu wrote in an email. Shiu estimated that the construction will be completed by early October.
The CSJ’s Executive Director, Andria Wisler, worked with several university departments throughout her tenure to develop a design to meet CSJ’s faculty, staff and student needs with this renovation. 
“CSJ will have a new front door opening onto 37th Street, and will serve as a visible symbol of our University’s commitment to social justice and the common good,” Wisler wrote in an email. “This is a commitment that CSJ enacts every day.” 
Students who work with the CSJ’s programs, which includes over 1,800 students per semester, study, tutor and hold meetings in the space. Joey Fernandez (SFS ’20), a DC Schools Project coordinator, wrote in a message to The Hoya that the building provides necessary working space. 
“Poulton Hall and the CSJ is an amazing space that provides student leaders the freedom to organize and develop programs for the local D.C. community,” Fernandez wrote. “My favorite use for the space is when we bring local elementary and middle school students for free tutoring services.”
The new rooms will facilitate more interaction between CSJ student coordinators and provide spaces to improve working relationships, DC Schools Project Coordinator Kelly Membreno Berrios (MSB ’20) said.
“It is going to be great to have more space to be able to work with your own program and then also be in community with other CSJ programs that we don’t really get to interact on the daily with,” Membreno said. 
Despite the ongoing construction in the CSJ building, students and staff have not been impacted by the renovations, according to Membreno. 
“They are still working on building the back — where the UPS was — so a lot of stuff has shifted around and you can hear the construction,” Membreno said. “But I will say this, the first time I walked into the CSJ when this semester started, I had no idea the construction was even going on.”
In recent years, Georgetown has funded the renovation of common spaces across campus, including Sellinger Lounge, Cooper Field and O’Donovan Hall. The university’s funding of the CSJ renovations affirms the social justice work that the CSJ with dozens of community partners and hundreds of Washington, D.C. families each week, according to Membreno. 
“We’ve seen so many other spaces on campus be renovated, and it is good to know that a center that dedicated itself to social justice and being about the larger D.C. community is also given attention,” Membreno said.

Activists need to center intersectionality when advocating for those who are HIV positive,  Charles Stephens, founder of the Counter Narrative Project, said in an event Sept. 8. 
The Counter Narrative Project, in solidarity with other social and racial justice movements, seeks to empower and amplify the voices of black gay men, according to its website. The organization aims to highlight their stories while encouraging voter registration, reducing crystal meth usage, improving HIV prevention medication accessibility, offering peer coaching and promoting the arts.
Although the Counter Narrative Project’s work is centered on the lives of black gay men, HIV advocacy connects this group to other individuals fighting the virus as well, according to Stephens. 
“To talk about HIV is to talk about intersectionality because we see an interplay of race and class and gender identity and sexual identity and economic distress,” Stephens said. “Just so many forces and factors contributing to one’s social vulnerability but also as a space of joy, as a space of finding ways to be resilient collectively.” 
The disability studies program hosted the event entitled “We Are Here: Anti-Black Racism, HIV Justice, and Future of Our Movement” in Copley Formal Lounge on Sunday. Stephens shared a series of videos featuring prominent HIV activists and encouraged an active dialogue with the audience throughout his presentation.
Sharing stories of black gay men living with HIV is a cornerstone of the Counter Narrative Project because it has the capacity to shape public policy and impact hearts and minds, according to Stephens.
“One of the things that I have been passionate about for my entire activist life really has been just wanting to use collective memory as a way to respond to injustice, wanting to take the stories of the movements I’m a part of, taking those stories and presenting them as evidence of our community resilience and resistance,” Stephens said. 
Stephens highlighted HIV activist Robert Suttle’s narrative throughout the event. Suttle was incarcerated in Louisiana for six months in 2010 after he was accused of failing to disclose his HIV positive status before a sexual encounter, according to the website of his advocacy organization, The Sero Project.  
Suttle’s story and prosecution under Louisiana’s “Intentional Exposure to AIDS Virus” statute prompts broader conversations surrounding laws that criminalize those with HIV, according to Stephens. The statute is similar to laws in 19 states that require people with HIV to disclose their positive status to sexual partners, according to a 2018 Center for Disease Control study. 
Other laws criminalize people with HIV for “low or negligible risk behavior” like biting or spitting. Such legislation needs to be updated to better reflect the scientific realities of HIV, according to Stephens. 
“Many public health associations and professionals have come out and said these laws are bad for public health and I think the question that we ask ourselves is: ‘What is optimal for public health and what is not optimal?’” Stephens said. “These laws are just not seen as optimal. They are seen as very harmful.” 
HIV criminalization expands beyond the traditional incarceration as those with HIV also have to face the court of public opinion, according to Stephens. 
“Criminalization isn’t just about putting people behind bars — which it is — but it is an entire system. People are criminalized in the media,” Stephens said. “Often times when people are charged and it makes its way to certain media outlets, they are convicted and tried by the media and you will see this horribly stigmatizing information before they even go before a judge.” 
Throughout the presentation, Stephens shared quotes from famous advocates who influenced the Counter Narrative Project, including writer Joseph Beam and poet Essex Hemphill. However, lesser known activists’ stories also inspire the organization’s work, according to Stephens. 
“There may not ever be books written about them. There may never be major movies about their lives but we hold their work in our hearts, in our work, in the DNA of our organization,” Stephens said. “When I think about what is means to resist anti-blackness in the HIV movement, I think about mainly them.”

Rangila marks its 25th anniversary this year and will use the showcase to pay homage to the individuals who shaped it over the years while introducing new elements like live music. 
Rangila, Georgetown University’s annual, student-run philanthropic showcase of South Asian dance, includes an average of 500 dancers, 1,500 audience members and $30,000 raised for India-based charities per showcase. 
This year’s 25th anniversary show, set for Nov. 22 to 23 in Gaston Hall, is themed “Make Your Mark.” This theme aims to celebrate Rangila’s past while simultaneously keeping the show rooted in the present, according to Rangila co-coordinator Anshul Agrawal (COL ’20). 
“We’re really trying to highlight the individuals that have shaped Rangila over the past 25 years as well as the individuals that are shaping it in its 25th year,” Agrawal said. “I think ‘Make Your Mark’ is the perfect amalgamation of that.”
While the show primarily features South Asian music, many of the choreographers also incorporate pop, rap and Latin music into their dances. Agrawal’s past dances have included genres ranging from traditional South Asian music to newer Bollywood tracks and rap songs like Kendrick Lamar’s “DNA.” Such variety helps show the dynamism of South Asian culture, according to Agrawal. 
“What Rangila strives to celebrate is how universal South Asian music and dance can be,” Agrawal said. “With most shows of this nature it’s either totally South Asian or it’s not very cultural at all, and I think Rangila brings a good mix because ultimately it’s a fusion showcase.”
This year Rangila will broaden its celebration of South Asian culture with its first in-house band, Saaz, composed of instrumentalists and vocalists from the Georgetown community that will perform their own original compositions inspired by South Asian music, according to Agrawal. 
This new element will expand Rangila’s cultural showcase to highlight areas beyond the choreographed aspect of the show, according to Raas dance co-choreographer Anika Sanghvi (SFS ’22). 
“Introducing a band makes it not as much dance-focused and more just about South Asian culture, and it broadens the scope of what Rangila is,” Sanghvi said in an interview with The Hoya. 
A key but often forgotten aspect of Rangila is its philanthropy, according to Sanghvi. Each year the Rangila philanthropic board selects an India-based charity to which they donate the show’s proceeds. 
This year, the money raised from Rangila will go toward Behala Anwesha The Quest, a nonprofit organization based in Kolkata, India, that supports children with disabilities through music and dance therapies, according to their website. 
Anwesha’s mission of helping children with disabilities develop their confidence aligns closely with Rangila’s own, according to Agrawal. 
“Their mission was something that we were really excited about because we also seek to empower people through music and dance,” Agrawal said. 
Rangila’s collaboration with Anwesha is particularly important given that mental and physical disability is rarely discussed in South Asian or American communities, according to Agrawal. 
“Issues of disability and the privilege that comes with being able-bodied is not something that we talk about too often,” he said. “So I was very excited for the Rangila community to engage with that issue this year by supporting Anwesha.”
Last year, the $30,000 raised from Rangila went to Prerana Anti-Human Trafficking, a nonprofit institution working toward ending the cycle of sex trafficking in India. Rangila has also partnered with Lend-A-Hand India, a nonprofit venture that provides vocational training to youth in rural and urban communities, and The Next Purpose, a nonprofit group that establishes sustainable medical and educational projects in underserved communities in India, in previous years.  
Through dance, music and philanthropy, Rangila has fostered an important cultural community on Georgetown’s campus for the past 25 years, especially among South Asian students, according to the Bulldog Bhangra dance choreographer, Syona Hariharan (SFS ’22). 
“It’s definitely given me a much better sense of community and family,” Hariharan said.
Rangila has also provided an important opportunity for South Asian students to share their culture and feel represented and appreciated on Georgetown’s predominantly white campus, according to Hariharan. 
“It’s nice to feel like people are interested in my culture and have such a positive attitude toward it,” Hariharan said. 
Agrawal is looking forward to shouldering the responsibility of coordinating this year’s cultural showcase despite the 25th anniversary’s added significance, he said. 
“Regardless of whatever year it was — whether it was the 24th or 100th—I’d feel the same amount of pressure simply because Rangila is such a huge event with so many people involved,”  Agrawal said. “It’s a whole lot of talent, it’s a whole lot of dedication, and it’s a whole lot of enthusiasm for the culture.”

Blommer Science Library’s future will be reevaluated by a committee of Georgetown University faculty, undergraduates and graduate students after the library’s relocation was put on hold over the summer, a reversal from previous plans to permanently close the library last spring.  
Last April, the university informed students and faculty that Blommer would permanently close and its materials would be relocated to Lauinger Library due to necessary renovations to the Reiss Science Building. The renovation was prompted by facilities issues including flooding and mold that have repeatedly damaged the books and journals stored in Blommer. Following the announcement about Blommer’s closure, students started a petition to the administration to keep the library open.
The university plans to establish a new committee to draft a set of recommendations concerning the future utilization of the library space, according to Kathryn Olesko, chair of the Main Campus Executive Committee and professor in the Science, Technology and International Affairs department in the School of Foreign Service.
“For the moment, the decision to close Blommer is rescinded until the needs of students and science and science-related faculty in the College, SFS (STIA) and SNHS can be taken into account in order to best meet their needs in Blommer and Lauinger,” Olesko wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In response to feedback relating to the potential closure, the provost and the Main Campus Executive Faculty Steering Committee will create the Blommer Library Faculty Review Committee. The review committee, comprised of faculty, undergraduates and graduate students, will examine the future of services, collections and study spaces in the library.
The process of drafting the recommendations is expected to last several months, according to Olesko.
“The MCEF-Provostial Blommer Library Review Committee will complete its work during the fall semester, or at the latest, early January,” Olesko wrote. “At that time it will send its report to both the Provost and the Main Campus Executive Faculty Steering Committee for review.” 
As reflected by the petition, many students expressed concerns they would lose access to the valuable resources Blommer’s collection offers following the closure, such as access to many science course textbooks that can pose a financial burden for students, according to Yixuan Zhao (COL ’22).
“For my hard science classes, I always check Blommer before buying the textbooks. A lot of the time they’ll have them and it saves me hundreds of dollars,” Zhao said in an interview with The Hoya. 
The majority of the library’s collections were planned to be relocated to Lau, while the few that were to be stored off campus at the Washington Research Library Consortium’s Shared Collections Facility would have been made available via HoyaSearch, the library’s search engine. Currently, there are science research materials in both Blommer and Lau and the move was also intended to consolidate the materials in one location.
Students also raised concerns about Blommer’s closure, as it is the only library in close proximity to Reiss, providing a convenient study space for students between classes and those residing in Darnall Hall, Henle Village and Arrupe Hall. 
While there is no announced date for when the relocation will take place, students can expect Blommer to be relocated to Lau sometime next year, according to Rebecca Hollister (COL ’21).
“As far as I know Blommer materials are going to be relocated in June of 2020,” Hollister wrote in an email to The Hoya. “So there are still two semesters of Blommer access! Right now we’re operating as normal.” 
Blommer, which houses more than 60,000 books and journals and provides extensive research opportunities for students looking for resources relating to STEM subjects, will remain open without interruption to its regular hours while the Blommer Review Committee drafts its recommendations concerning the future of the library. 
“No changes will be made to the current operations and services in the Blommer Science Library,” the library said in a news release.

The Prisons and Justice Initiative will be featured in Kim Kardashian West’s upcoming Oxygen documentary following her work on prison reform and in a separate television documentary on an unannounced major network.
The documentary, “Kim Kardashian West: The Justice Project,” follows Kardashian West’s prison reform advocacy that brought her to the Washington, D.C. Correctional Treatment Facility in July, where she met Prisons and Justice Initiative Director and professor Marc Howard.
The Georgetown Prison Scholars Program at the D.C. Jail, launched by Howard’s initiative in January 2018, provides both credit and noncredit courses for incarcerated scholars and will feature in the Oxygen special.
The Prisons and Justice Initiative has hosted multiple course for Georgetown University students annually. A spring 2020 class will be filmed by a professional crew for a multi-episode documentary series to air on a major network. The course, “Making an Exoneree,” focuses on the cases of six likely wrongfully convicted people and has attracted national media attention in the past.
Howard founded the Prisons and Justice Initiative in 2016. Through public events, courses and programs at local prisons, the initiative aims to better understand the mass incarceration crisis and contribute to effective reform solutions, according to the Prisons and Justice Initiative website.
Kardashian West’s advocacy began in 2018, when the reality star ran a successful campaign for Alice Marie Johnson’s clemency. After discovering a passion for criminal justice reform, Kardashian West made it one of her priorities to help grant more citizens like Johnson their freedoms and rights.
Following her D.C. visit, Kardashian West tweeted her support of Howard’s work and applauded his desire to educate college students about criminal reform.
“Last week I was so moved by Dr. Marc Howard, a Georgetown professor who teaches a course inside of a DC prison where men & women can get Georgetown credits,” the tweet wrote. “I met so many amazing people that can’t wait to share their stories with you.”
A premiere date for “Kim Kardashian West: The Justice Project” has yet to be announced.
In Howard’s “Prison Reform Project” course, students conduct intensive research on the cases and develop short documentaries, websites and social media campaigns that advocate for the innocence of a wrongfully committed person.
Howard’s goal is for students to become lifelong supporters of criminal justice reform, Howard wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“I want students to walk away from the class with pride (for their tireless work to try to save an innocent person’s life), compassion (for the suffering of others), and empowerment (based on their ability to effect real change in the world),” Howard wrote. “But most importantly I want them to develop a lifelong passion for correcting injustice that can never be extinguished, no matter what their individual futures hold.”
The course requires students to apply months in advance. Students must submit a brief cover letter, a resume, an unofficial transcript and a three-minute webcam video to be considered. Nearly 100 applications have been submitted for the spring 2020 version of the course, but only 15 students will be accepted.
Howard’s course allows students to see how their work can make an impact, government department Chair Charles King wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“Prof. Howard has become a noted authority on prisons and punishment in a global context and, through his innovative teaching, has broken down the walls between incarcerated individuals and the rest of American society,” King wrote. “This is exactly the kind of work that we should all strive to do—daring, pathbreaking, and truly life-changing.”
Howard’s course began in 2016 with the pilot course involving extended class meetings and student interactions with incarcerated individuals. The course gained national attention and was featured as the cover story of The Washington Post in September 2016.
The 2018 and 2019 cohorts of “Prison Reform Project” also focused on wrongful convictions. Last year’s class investigated the cases of six wrongfully convicted men in the mid-Atlantic region, hoping to prove their innocence, according to Alex Buffone (COL ’20), who took Howard’s course.
Although he and his classmates did not exonerate their client within just one semester, Buffone wrote that the course left a lasting impression on him.
“It was by far the greatest experience of not only my academic life, but also my life in general. It totally changed my perspective of our government and the criminal justice system. It was so rewarding to see how your work was positively impacting someone’s life,” Buffone wrote. “Myself and my group continue to work on the case and are hopeful that Eric (our client) will be exonerated.”
Three undergraduate students in Howard’s 2018 “Prison Reform Project” seminar unearthed evidence that led to the exoneration of Valentino Dixon, who spent 26 years in prison after being found guilty of murder.
As the course moves into its fourth iteration, Howard hopes the publicity will show others the need for justice reform and to continue to empower students to become strong advocates.
“My hope is that the course will lead to a successful and long-running TV show, that we will help exonerate even more people–as we have so far with Valentino Dixon–and that we will change public perception about both wrongful convictions and the ability of students to improve the world,” Howard wrote. “We definitely hope to have reunions with past students, and hopefully more exonerees.”

Three Georgetown undergraduate students showcased their comedic talent at the local “DC’s Best Young Comedians” showcase held at Dupont Underground on Sept. 6.
Student comedians Sahaj Sharda (SFS ’20), Gary Simons (COL ’21) and Daniel Ruescher (COL ’20) performed at the event hosted by entertainment agency Asteria Entertainment last week. The performances took place at the Dupont Underground arts space and featured 12 current and recent college graduate comedians from Georgetown, American University, George Washington University, Catholic University, University of Maryland, George Mason University, Johns Hopkins University and James Madison University.
Asteria Entertainment recruited young Washington, D.C. comedians to perform five-to-10 minute sets at the show, according to Sharda, who was contacted by the agency after performing at open mic events in the District throughout the summer. Sharda sent in copies of his act and was then contacted to perform at the event.
As all the comedians were in similar stages of their comedic careers, and because the event included an engaging audience of 300 people, the event was enjoyable for performers, according to Sharda.
“We were all in a similar place experience-wise,” Sharda said. “It was fun, everyone went up and did their sets for five-to-10 minutes, and the crowd really got into it. It was a really good time.”
Taking the step to send existing comedy work to Asteria Entertainment also provided the push needed for young comedians to create new content, according to Simons, who is a member of Georgetown Improv Association.
“A lot of times people want to do things but never do it, like never put forth the effort to make it happen, like writing material or practicing material,” Simons said. “It’s hard cause you have classes and there’s nothing forcing you to do it, so just putting myself out there, sending the stuff I had done and them saying yes, forced me to create kind of like new content.”
The event provided a platform for individuals with diverse backgrounds and voices to express their thoughts through comedy, something that does not happen frequently at Georgetown, according to Simons.
“I think that sometimes, especially in spaces like Georgetown, diversity in comedy doesn’t happen too much, so I was really happy that I got to get my voice out there and have it be heard,” Simons said.
Hosting a comedian showcase that highlights younger comedians provides current and recent college graduates with the respect and support they deserve, according to Rebecca Lamis, the founder of Asteria Entertainment.
“Most of the professional comedy venues do not always treat younger comedians with the respect they deserve,” Lamis wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I want to ensure everyone has a great time and feels valued when performing with Asteria.”
Asteria puts on events with the intent of providing artists with performance opportunities that they may not often encounter, according to Lamis. Keeping this goal in mind, Asteria puts on affordable events for college students in the D.C.-Maryland-Virginia area such as “Better Than A Cappella: A Night of Stand-Up Comedy and Music” in February.
Performing in DC’s Best Young Comedians made doing standup in the future as a hobby a possibility, said Simons.
“I kind of recently, like last semester, realized that I enjoyed comedy, and I’m not sure that it’s necessarily a space that I want to do professionally, but I knew I definitely wanted to do more of it in just performing,” Simons said.
For those wanting to do standup comedy, performing at open mics and practicing jokes at smaller events is important when starting before moving on to comedy events like “D.C.’s Best Young Comedians” that require selection, according to Sharda.
“But I would say start at the open mic level, go to some of these things, sort of run your jokes, run your craft,” Sharda said. “You’re going to be bad probably for the first month, two months, three months, but eventually you’ll get the hang of it, and then something like this event is naturally going to appear on the horizons for you.”

The majority of the sustainability-focused projects awarded Georgetown University’s new Laudato Si’ Grant are by faculty and staff, who are now planning and executing their proposals for this academic year. 
The Office of Sustainability announced the Laudato Si’ Fund, named after Pope Francis’ 2015 encyclical on environmental justice, in January to encourage collaboration combating sustainability challenges. The 11 grant recipients revealed at the end of May include eight projects by professors and staff in a range of campus programs. 
Among the faculty and staff projects receiving grant funds are “Design Transfigured,” an exhibition featuring fashion and furniture made of waste materials; “Disability, Disaster and Climate Change: A Public Ethics Project,” which features a summit on the intersection of disability, environmental ethics and climate change and “Incorporating Sustainability Across the Curriculum,” which will work with faculty to make their courses more environmentally friendly. 
The $300,000 in the Laudato Si’ Fund was distributed to the different projects in amounts ranging from $10,000 to $50,000.
“Design Transfigured” will show 40 works of clothing, jewelry and furniture crafted from trash in an effort to convey pollution’s impact. Led by Albey Miner, director of Georgetown University galleries, the exhibition will feature 25 international designers and studios.
It will not only create avenues for conversations around sustainability, but also show that waste can be creatively utilized to make useful products, according to Miner. 
“We always intend our exhibitions to spark interesting new dialogues among our campus community,” Miner wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This particular show will hopefully expand individuals’ definition of “upcycling” and challenge them to consider new ways of approaching waste.”
The exhibition will show in the Maria & Alberto de la Cruz Art Gallery and Lucille M. and Richard F.X. Spagnuolo Art Gallery starting Oct. 2 during a public reception and will remain on display until Dec. 15. There will also be a panel on Oct. 3 following the exhibition’s opening featuring a few of the artists, one of the art curators and some Georgetown faculty members, according to Miner.
The “Design Transformed” display is crucial in highlighting the role that artists and designers play in finding a solution to current environmental issues, according to Miner. 
“The environmental crisis impacts all of us; we often hear about potential solutions from scientists and politicians, but artists and designers are making fascinating and unique contributions to the conversation and to our lives,” Miner wrote.
Laudato Si’ Grant recipient Julia Watts Belser, an associate professor of Jewish studies, is gathering activists, artists and academics for “Disability, Disaster and Climate Change: A Public Ethics Project.” 
The project will include a three-day strategy summit March 28 to 30 featuring around 20 scholars and activists. The summit will discuss topics like how prisons are frequently located in environmentally harmful areas and the structural barriers facing disabled communities that become life-threatening in an emergency, according to Belser. 
Bringing together people from a range of disciples will facilitate an exchange of ideas, according to Belser.
“One of my key goals for the project is to bring together a highly interdisciplinary group of scholars, artists, and activists — people who don’t usually have a chance to be in the same room, strategizing together, sharing ideas, and exchanging knowledge,” Belser wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Climate change can lead to conflict, and the impact of both are particularly felt by those with disabilities, Belser wrote. These intersections will be another source of discussion at the summit.  
“We’ll also have scholars and activists present who’re thinking about the intersection of disability, war, and climate change,” Belser wrote.  “Climate change is a significant driver of conflict, and war is a tremendous cause of both disability and environmental harm — not just in the immediate sense of disability caused by the overt violence of war, but also because chemical residues from weaponry often affects regions for generations.”
“Incorporating Sustainability Across the Curriculum,” led by Senior Associate Director for Assessment and Programs at the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship Mindy McWilliams, will work with about 10 faculty members to develop their courses’ environmental friendliness.
The project provides faculty members an opportunity to discuss how to incorporate sustainability into classes and daily life in a forum that previously did not exist on campus, according to McWilliams. 
“There are a lot of courses, minors and majors where students can focus on learning about sustainability and environmental education, but I haven’t really seen at Georgetown anything that brought faculty together to talk about these issues and how they’re trying to make strides in their own courses,” McWilliams said in an interview with The Hoya.
In the spring, McWilliams plans to host a public forum or speaker that will involve more of the university community. 
The project’s collaborative and discussion-based model creates an environment in which people can share ideas and be inspired to shift toward more ecologically-conscious lifestyles, McWilliams said. 
“To bring people together and share resources and ideas to get inspired together always seems to have a lot more power than doing things in isolation,” McWilliams said.

Fifty Georgetown students living on and off campus began composting their residential food because of a collaboration between Compost Cab, a compost pick-up service, and the Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network.
Participating students who live in apartments or townhouses will collect their compostable food scraps each week in a five-gallon bucket to bring to a centralized pickup location. For those in townhouses, Compost Cab will pick up the compost from Alumni Square for on-campus residences and from the front steps for townhouses, according to co-leader Noelle Gignoux (SFS ’22). 
Composting residences were chosen based on students who expressed an interest in participating in the pilot program over the summer. At least one student from every participating household underwent training Sept. 11 to learn how to use the composting service, as well as to learn the specifics of what is compostable. 
Continued educational trainings are another part of GREEN’s compost team’s mission, whose members hope that more information about composting will help make Georgetown more sustainably focused, according to Gignoux.
“We want to cultivate a culture of compost and sustainability,” Gignoux said. “If they start talking about it more and if they start going to cool educational events about compost then they’ll tell their friends about it, so we’re hoping that it’s going to snowball.”
 
The composting initiative was funded through a grant from the Laudato Si’ Fund, named after Pope Francis’ 2015 encyclical on environmental justice. The $300,000 fund was distributed to 11 projects that aim to address global and local issues of sustainability. Among the grant recipients was the GREEN composting team, headed by Gignoux and Hannah Funk (SFS ’20), who applied for the grant to make sustainability easier for Georgetown students.
The composting initiative has provided an easy and accessible way for students to help the environment, according to participant and off-campus townhouse resident Emma Berk (COL ’20). 
“I think composting is important because it’s a simple way to make a significant difference, especially if a great deal of households participate in this program,” Berk wrote in a message to The Hoya. “I decided to participate in the program because it has made composting extremely simple for students, I don’t see why one wouldn’t participate in the program based on how simple Compost Cab has made it.”
 Pursuing residential composting has been a goal for GREEN, which has other composting initiatives on campus such as collecting food scraps during the Georgetown University Farmers’ Market. However, Funk thought to partner with Compost Cab after personally using the service during the last academic year, according to Gignoux. 
 That Georgetown’s composting is part of a student-driven sustainability movement led Compost Cab to partner with the project, according to Compost Cab founder Jeremy Brosowsky. 
 “We love this project, and we’re proud to help bring it to life. What’s most significant is that from the outset, this effort has been entirely student-driven,” Brosowsky wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We think student-driven programs are the right model for food waste reduction at scale in colleges and universities, and we’re excited for this pilot to succeed and prove that.”
Compost Cab typically partners with urban farms and community gardens, which take the soil created by their compost. A usual weekly pickup subscription for Compost Cab costs $8 per week per residence, but Georgetown students will not be paying for their own subscriptions, which the Laudato Si’ grant from the university will fund. Members of the Compost Cab service reported a 40% drop in household waste as a result of using their program, according to the Department of Energy and Environment.  
 Beyond the scope of Georgetown, Gignoux hopes that students who learn to compost as a part of this program will carry those skills with them after graduation.
 “Most of the people who signed up are juniors and seniors, because they’re living in apartments,” Gignoux said. “They’re going to be here for this year, they’re going to learn about composting and they’re hopefully going to change the culture here at Georgetown a little bit, but also they’re going out into the real world and so hopefully when they leave they’ll find a way in their adult lives to also compost.”
Hoya staff writer Harrison McBride contributed to this reporting.

Keith Grossman, president of the global media corporation TIME, warned students of the potential consequences of paywalls in media and political polarization at an event at Georgetown University on Sept. 11. 
Grossman, who has managed TIME’s business, advertising and marketing operations since joining the company in July 2019, spoke in the Fisher Colloquium in the Rafik B. Hariri Building. Grossman was the latest speaker in the “Stanton Distinguished Leaders Series,” put on by the McDonough School of Business to showcase the best of the business world, according to the MSB website.
Paywall mechanisms used by media companies like The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and other subscription sources can alienate less privileged consumers and leave them vulnerable to misinformation, according to Grossman at the event. 
“If all of the greatest, most premium news sources think that the right path forward is to put a paywall on their content, what they’re doing is they’re creating content for an affluent audience, not for the general public,” Grossman said. “Now, there’s nothing wrong with that, but the problem is that the general public thinks that news is a public utility, but it’s not, it’s a for-profit entity for the most part.”
Instead of going through the practical and financial hardship of subscribing to a news source, consumers will search for other, generally poorer quality sources, Grossman said.
“What you find is if you all of a sudden put paywalls on all of the greatest news sources out there — and there are paywalls on the greatest news sources out there — and you put that back into a distributive news environment, when the consumer is faced with finding or accessing a piece of news that is all of a sudden gated, they don’t tend to go through the whole process,” Grossman said. 
Some news companies use other methods to enable free news consumption. Many American publications, like The New York Times, offer nonsubscribers a monthly limit of articles they can read for free. TIME Magazine has previously operated under a limit system that granted readers free access to 10 articles a month but then required a $2.99 subscription to continue reading as of 2015. 
By establishing paywalls for more specialized information and leaving general news open to the public, companies could increase accessibility, according to Grossman. 
“My personal belief, my bias, and where I’d like to see TIME go is: at the highest level, we’re giving the general news, keep that open and free, and put more gated communities around what I would say are the niche areas of the site,” he said.
Grossman’s perspective comes after an extensive career in the media, including former positions as Chief Revenue Officer at Bloomberg Media and Chief Operating Officer at Engine, a global marketing firm. Grossman also worked as an associate publisher for the technology publications Wired and Ars Technica. 
In a profit-driven media environment where partisan slants can boost ratings, media companies have incentives to be polarizing, according to Grossman.  
“What you’re finding yourself in is a scenario where news again is not a public utility. It’s a for-profit business. What they’re finding is that it’s easier for them to bifurcate further,” Grossman said. 
Social media also poses a threat, as individuals are consuming media in an increasingly manipulated expanding echo chamber, according to Grossman.
“The other issue that people are finding is that in a distributive news environment where people are getting information on social media platforms, people are creating their own friend networks with news that is reinforcing filter bubbles of how people are sharing to each other,” Grossman said. “It worries me how we actually navigate ourselves out of this. I don’t really know the answer.”
To combat fake news circulated on social media, regulators should increase oversight of companies like Facebook and Google that disseminate news, according to Grossman. 
“If they’re classified as media companies then they’re responsible for the content that they allow to be distributed, and that would solve everything, but that’s not what is happening,” Grossman said.

Demonstrators gathered for a vigil in honor of the victims of March’s Ethiopian Airlines crash, which took the life of Cedric Asiavugwa (LAW ’19), outside the Department of Transportation on Sept. 10. 
The vigil commemorated the six-month anniversary of the Ethiopian Airlines crash which killed 157 people March 10. Participants held up photographs of the victims that were killed in the crash, including Asiavugwa. The Ethiopian Airlines crash is the second accident involving a 737 Boeing Max; the Lion Air crash in Indonesia took place five months earlier in October 2018 and killed all 189 passengers and crew aboard. 
Nadia Milleron, whose daughter, Samya Stumo, was killed in the crash, co-hosted the vigil. Milleron organized the vigil because of her struggles arranging a meeting with Ali Bahrami, the Federal Aviation Administration’s associate administrator for aviation safety, who failed to address safety concerns about the plane, she said. 
“The reason we did the vigil was because of the frustration of not being able to get that meeting,” Milleron said in an interview with The Hoya. “We did it to remind the world that this is the cost and any one of you, your friends, your family could be us.”
Boeing discovered a problem with a key safety feature on its 737 Max planes in 2017 within months of the company delivering the first 737 Max planes to airlines, according to a statement from Boeing in May 2019. The indicator, an “Angle of Attack Disagree Alert,” is designed to warn pilots if the plane’s sensors are transmitting incorrect data about the direction of the plane’s nose. 
Boeing conducted a safety review that concluded the nonworking alert did not affect airplane safety or operation, and the company chose not to disclose the issue to airlines or safety regulators until after the Lion Air crash in October 2018, according to NPR. 
Boeing failed to comprehensively address the safety feature issue after the Lion Air crash, and the company’s negligence cost innocent lives, according to Milleron.
“They figured that was enough time for Boeing to correct the problem while the plane remained in service, but that decision killed our family,” Milleron said. “That decision killed my daughter.”
Since the March crash, Boeing has faced broad public backlash. Boeing is dedicated to supporting those affected and will prioritize improving safety features on the 737 Max, according to the company. 
“Our hearts go out to the loved ones of those whose lives were lost, and this will continue to weigh heavily on us,” a Boeing spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are committed to supporting the affected communities and working with customers, global regulators and industry partners to make the 737 MAX one of the safest airplanes to ever fly.” 
The company plans to dedicate a $50 million fund of short-term aid to families of the victims of both the Ethiopian Airlines crash and the Lion Air crash, according to a July news release from the company.
Boeing also completed updates to the plane’s software and was in the process of testing and documentation with the FAA to recertify and resume operation of the aircraft, according to a Boeing news release from May. 
Boeing is now providing additional information to the FAA’s requests that includes details on how pilots interact with the airplane controls and displays in different flight scenarios, according to a Boeing news release. Once the requests are addressed, Boeing will work with the FAA to schedule its certification test flight and submit final certification documentation, according to the news release.
Moving forward, participants and organizers of the vigil plan to advocate for stronger certification processes independent of Boeing’s internal review to ensure general plane safety, according to Milleron. 
“What we’re trying to do is make sure that the certification process certifies a safe plane,” Milleron said. “The system is falling apart because of this delegation to Boeing. Delegation of review of safety is going to Boeing. They’re reviewing themselves. Their motivation is to save money.”

Georgetown University faced mixed results in the 2020 college rankings released Monday by the U.S. News & World Report, losing ground in the overall national ranking while rising in the undergraduate programs category.
The university, ranked 24th in the United States, is down from being tied for 22nd place last year but remains the highest-ranked institution of higher education in the Washington, D.C. area, according to the rankings. 
While the rankings provide one way to measure the relative standing of a university, they do not fully represent the success of a university, according to Georgetown Provost Robert Groves.
“Georgetown continues to be ranked among the top 25 universities nationwide by U.S. News and World Report and in the top 15 by Forbes,” Groves wrote in an email to The Hoya. “While Georgetown is pleased to be recognized with strong rankings across multiple outlets, we believe it is important not to place too much emphasis on these rankings since they only represent certain dimensions of a University’s success.”
In the Forbes college rankings released August, Georgetown dropped three spots, down to 15th from 12th the year before. 
In addition to the change in the national rankings, Georgetown’s undergraduate programs were ranked 10 spots higher than last year, up to 16th place from 26th place.
The higher ranking is a result that will bring more visibility to the university and its student-centered mission, according to Georgetown College Dean Christopher Celenza.
“Georgetown is a special place, where faculty who are leaders in their research fields make sure to be in the classroom with students,” Celenza wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In recent years, there has been increased focus on bringing undergraduate students into the research experience, so that students are learning actively, by doing.”
Georgetown increased in rankings in recent years as spring 2019 nationwide and global surveys ranked the McCourt School of Public Policy and the McDonough School of Business highly, with the MSB named first in the world for having the best-trained MBAs.
The rankings are encouraging signs, and the Office of Undergraduate Admissions focuses on rises and falls primarily because of how they can impact potential applicants’ understanding of Georgetown, Dean of Admissions Charles Deacon (CAS ’64, GRD ’69) said in an interview with The Hoya.
“We tend over the years not to worry about it much,” Deacon said. “We do worry about it from the point of view that there are some kids in our pool or nationally who go to big schools with not much high school counseling and don’t know us that well and they may tend to be more influenced by the rankings.”
Princeton University topped the U.S. News rankings this year, followed by Harvard University in second place, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Columbia University and Yale University tied for third place. Georgetown was ranked highest in the D.C. area, while Howard University and George Mason University both dropped over 15 spots from last year’s rankings.
The U.S. News rankings take into account a range of factors to determine the rankings, including alumni donations, SAT and ACT scores of applicants, and the perceived prestige of the universities.
On the admissions side, Deacon said the Georgetown applicant pool has been growing stronger in terms of standardized test scores, which are usually reflected in the rankings.
“We have had good support from President DeGioia and the board in terms of our policies, which really admissions wise, as I say they may not be more than five or 10 percent of that ranking comes from admissions stuff, SAT averages, those are pretty good,” Deacon said.
For its 2020 list, U.S. News implemented new ranking criteria that heavily weighed social mobility and graduation outcomes. Forbes uses a different methodology, heavily weighing outcomes such as alumni salary, student satisfaction, student debt after college and other measures of success to determine the rankings.
While the rankings show mixed results, the university is concentrating on students’ academic satisfaction as well as postgraduate outcomes, according to Groves.
“We are focused on the success of our students, the scholarship and research of our faculty members, and how we advance our mission each day,” Groves wrote.

The debate around migration in the United States shifted from a bipartisan issue to a highly polarized one in recent years, but recognizing the impact on local communities could revitalize productive conversation, panelists at an Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life event said Wednesday. 
The Gaston Hall panel welcomed four immigration leaders from across the political spectrum, including Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program recipient and Georgetown student Mizraim Belman Guerrero (SFS ’20), former U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), former Chief of Staff to President Barack Obama Denis McDonough and Vice President of Programs at Grantmakers Concerned with Immigrants and Refugees Aryah Somers Landsberger. 
Individual stories help Americans understand the hardships of both immigration and those affected by it here, panelists said. Belman Guerrero told the story of his family’s migration to the United States and how he swam across the Rio Grande despite not knowing how to swim before squeezing into a car with an American family to cross a border checkpoint. 
This experience was difficult and intense enough by itself, but the emotional cost of living in the United States without legal documentation is high, Belman Guerrero said. He described how three of his grandparents have died without his family having the ability to visit them or attend their funerals without risking legal trouble. 
“For undocumented people, they don’t have those luxuries, they don’t have the basic human dignity to be able to say goodbye to their loved ones for the last time, and they face other challenges where they don’t have access to the same rights as any other person should have,” Belman said. 
After Belman Guerrero finished telling his story, McDonough focused on the reality that the extremes people must go to in order to cross the southern border does not prevent people from migrating because it is their best option. 
“We know that the cruelty we’ve seen on the border does not deter people from traveling here,” McDonough said. “There are people who — we just heard an amazing story — who under significant pressure want something better for [their] kids — it’s something I want for mine, all three of them — and so cruelty is not a deterrent, that’s point one.” 
While personal narratives are powerful in demonstrating the complexities of immigration, research and data-driven information can help counter xenophobic and racist narratives about migrants, Somers Landsberger said. 
“We are really struggling with a research-based narrative that can counter that deep anxiety that people are feeling across America in welcoming the stranger across racial divides,” Somers Landsberger said. 
Curbelo and McDonough both pointed out that history and data demonstrate how the premise that there is a particularly aggravated crisis right now ignores the reality that there have been varied migration crises throughout American history. McDonough told the story of his Irish immigrant family, who immigrated to the United States alongside millions of other Irish people in a time of strong anti-Irish sentiment. 
Curbelo, who is from Miami, described the Mariel boatlift, when Fidel Castro announced that any Cubans wishing to emigrate to the United States were free to leave the port of Mariel. Over 125,000 Cubans arrived in Florida, according to History.com. 
Curbelo, who is the son of Cuban refugees and led ultimately unsuccessful efforts to pass bipartisan immigration reform legislation while a member of the House of Representatives, emphasized the inherent tension in the migration debate. 
“The United States has a right and responsibility to enforce its borders, to honor the rule of law, to demand that immigration to our country be orderly, predictable and such that it does not pose an undue burden on our citizens,” Curbelo said. “I think the other big idea we must uphold is that the United States should be a compassionate nation that welcomes people in need, that affords opportunity to those in faraway lands who don’t have the opportunity to cross one of our borders.”

The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts will debut the Reach, its first major expansion since its opening in 1971, kicking off with a two-week-long festival that began last Saturday. 
The Reach is an immersive arts center constructed in the green space next to the Kennedy Center building, containing three pavilions, an outdoor stage and 11 flexible spaces, which will be used for performances, events and classes. 
The Kennedy Center is hosting the Reach Opening Festival from Sept. 7-22. The festival will include nearly 500 free events, including concerts and art installations, according to the festival website. Programming will be free, but festival attendees must obtain timed-entry tickets. 
The Reach’s spaces and events are designed to foster organic collaboration and encourage artistic inspiration, according to Kennedy Center Director of Public Relations Rachelle Roe.
“We could have a ballet company in one of the rooms who takes a break and then they bump into a jazz artist who they’ve always admired coming out of rehearsal and some new piece of art might happen because of it,” Roe said in an interview with The Hoya. “The whole idea is for that flexibility and that inspiration to happen in these spaces.” 
Each day of the opening festival schedule offers a variety of activities, ranging from a “Spotlight on Classical and Broadway” orchestral performance of Alan Menken songs to a “Hip Hop Block Party,” an all-day celebration of hip hop music. The diverse lineup of artists and musicians reflects the variety of Kennedy Center offerings, Roe said.
“The Kennedy Center offers so many different genres, everything from comedy and hip hop and jazz and orchestras and operas and ballet and theater,” Roe said. “It’s such a huge range — we tried to take a little bit of everything.”
After the festival ends, the Reach will regularly host performances, films and art installations, along with other community events. 
The Reach will be an active space where visitors can also interact with artists and find themselves surrounded by art in progress, Kennedy Center President Deborah Rutter wrote in a news release.
“More and more, today’s audiences crave connection — with art and with each other — while artists and arts organizations desire customized spaces that nurture their creative endeavors,” Rutter wrote. “The Reach will fulfill many of those needs, all within a one-of-a-kind design that is a work of art in and of itself.” 
The community has responded enthusiastically to the center’s opening, according to Roe.
“The response has been great,” Roe said. “Last night, which was Wednesday, we had our largest evening crowd yet for the National Symphony Orchestra and Alan Menken came out and they did a whole bunch of his famous songs from Broadway and Disney movies and the response was really positive.”
The Reach expansion project was first announced in January 2013. The $250 million expansion plan added pavilions and 130,000 square feet of gardens, as well as 72,000 square feet of interior space to house studios, performance and rehearsal spaces and learning centers. The Kennedy Center fundraised extensively to support the project, according to the Washington Business Journal. 
Steven Holl Architects, the team that designed the expansion, intends for the additions to continue the center’s mission as a living memorial for President John F. Kennedy, according to its website. The landscape includes a grove of 35 ginkgo trees to signify Kennedy’s position as the 35th president.
The flexible outdoor space of The Reach complements the iconic, yet isolated, stone Edward Durell Building, according to Roe.
“The stone building is a very traditional concert hall type building with lots of activity that goes on behind closed doors and people come and they see a performance and its very polished and then that’s it,” Roe said. “The Reach is designed to sort of turn this building inside out and to be able to show what goes on behind closed doors over here.”
Georgetown University and the Kennedy Center introduced a new partnership last fall: the Georgetown-Kennedy Center Seminar Series. Students in the seminar attended three shows at the Kennedy Center for free and engaged in post-performance discussions with professors centered around a specific theme. 
The program is set to be relaunched in the spring of 2019 as a one-credit course titled, “Encounters in Global Performance.” In addition to the three free shows and discussions, the course will culminate with a student presentation at the Kennedy Center Arts Summit.
The Reach was inspired by Kennedy’s vision for art and artists to be more accessible to the community, Kennedy Center Chairman David Rubenstein wrote in a news release.
“The Reach is a one-of-a-kind building, and we see it as a ‘forever building,’ not simply because we want it to be around for a long time, but because there is a memorial aspect to our work here at the Kennedy Center,” Rubenstein wrote. “We are President Kennedy’s living memorial, and we take that responsibility very seriously.”

Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, a sports complex that formerly housed the Washington Redskins and D.C. United teams, is set to be demolished by 2021.
The Washington Convention and Sports Authority, otherwise known as Events DC, conveyed the plan for demolition in a proposal released Sept. 5. The Washington, D.C.-based agency, which manages the stadium as well as Nationals Park, Walter E. Washington Convention Center and other D.C. venues, will be receiving bids from contractors for the demolition until Oct. 25. The stadium was most recently used for games for D.C. United, Washington’s professional soccer club, from 1996 to 2017. RFK Stadium will be demolished because it presents a financial burden for the District, and because of some officials’ desire to prevent the controversial Redskins from building a stadium on the property. 
The stadium stands as a historical site for athletics in its unique ability to house a variety of sports, according to Kevin Reichard, a publisher at the sports news website Football Stadium Digest and a D.C. native.
“Not only was RFK Stadium the first true multi-use stadium to be built, it was the first and last one that actually worked both for baseball and football equally well,” Reichard wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Most cookie-cutter facilities failed at both tasks, but RFK Stadium was a pleasant place to watch both MLB baseball and NFL football.”
RFK Stadium first opened in 1961 as the home for the District’s major league football team, the Redskins, from 1961 to 1996. The team won three super bowls while playing at the stadium. The Washington Nationals also briefly played at RFK Stadium from 2005 to 2007 during the construction of Nationals Park in Navy Yard. In addition to housing major league sports teams, RFK Stadium also served as the stage for a series of musical acts during its run, including The Beatles, Pink Floyd and Foo Fighters. 
The stadium will continue to host small events while demolition proposals are submitted, according to Gregory O’Dell, president and CEO of Events DC.
“The facility is 58-years old and has exceeded its useful life.  Decommissioning and demolishing a project of this scale requires significant planning, labor and due diligence, which is expected to take months,” O’Dell wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We will continue to operate the facility while simultaneously planning the demolition activities.”
Football fans have also speculated that a new stadium might be built at the site of RFK Stadium as a way to bring back the Redskins to the District. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) expressed a desire to return the football team to the city limits at a luncheon last August, according to the Washington City Paper. Since leaving RFK Stadium in 1996, the Redskins have been playing at FedExField Stadium in Landover, Md. D.C. United plays at Audi Field in Navy Yard. 
Returning the team closer to the city could help recreate the excitement for D.C. football fans, according to Reichard.
“My personal preference would be a new Redskins stadium at the same site,” Reichard wrote. “People tend to forget the electric atmosphere throughout the District whenever the Redskins were in town: Even if you were not heading for the Redskins game, you still shared in the experience. It’s a great location for a new stadium: well-served by mass transit and freeway access.”
However, the Redskins face pushback from lawmakers who say the team’s name is an offensive slur against Native Americans, including Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.) and Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.), according to The Washington Post. 
Bowser had previously backed a movement to purchase the property from the federal government. While both Bowser and Redskins owner Daniel Snyder had previously expressed a desire for the football team to return to the District proper, the District has not had any serious conversations with the team about a new stadium, according to The Washington Post. 
While the chances of a Redskins return to the District are becoming more slim, Reichard still holds out hope that the heyday of football games in D.C. could come back.
“Between the rocking stands and the unbelievable crowd noise, a home Redskins game was a unique experience—and one not matched by the team since the move to FedEx Field, ” Reichard wrote.

I dont see the problem with building a brand new stadium in the city of DC. It will bring a new vibrancy the city desperately needs, and not too mention the stadium will be a job creator. It needs workers to help build the stadium. More workers to keep the stadium up and running. More jobs for the people , cultural and social uplift. Im sure this project will be attractive to many investors. The Washington football team has changed their name due to unnecessary bureaucracy. In my perspective bureaucracy is the only thing standing in the way.
