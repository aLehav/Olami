Georgetown University administrators published the university’s plan for the fall semester July 6, following months of deliberations and student frustration. In the weeks leading up to Georgetown’s announcement, other universities in Washington, D.C., unveiled their fall semester plans. Here are how their approaches compare. 
When was the plan published?

Can students live on campus? Who can return?
Georgetown University
Georgetown plans to house approximately 2,000 undergraduate students on campus. Freshmen and select upperclassmen — including students with complicated home situations, ROTC cadets, some residential assistants, students who need to be on campus to complete degree requirements — will be able to live on campus in single-occupancy rooms. Students requiring on-campus housing must complete an application; students already approved for on-campus housing during past semesters do not need to reapply. Georgetown said it will invite more students back to campus should administrators deem it safe. 
American University
AU will allow freshmen and some sophomores to live on campus in single-occupancy rooms. The university has also reserved limited off-campus housing for sophomores who had previously been assigned on-campus housing but will not be able to reside on campus. 
The Catholic University of America
Students will be allowed to live on campus in the fall in less dense residence halls. Most students will live in singles. CUA has not yet provided information about exactly how many students will live on campus. 
The George Washington University
GWU plans on inviting students back in the fall. The university will house on-campus residents in suites and reduce the density of more crowded living spaces. The plan does not disclose an exact number of students who can return.
Howard University
Howard will allow students to return to campus in the fall and live in single and double rooms. Howard’s plan does not yet include details about how many students will be allowed to live on campus. 
What will classes look like?
Georgetown University
Most classes will be held virtually, but some courses will be run in a hybrid format with in-person and virtual options. All classes will shift online the week of Thanksgiving. The university said it plans to increase the number of in-person learning options to ensure international students living in the United States do not face deportation as the Department of Homeland Security ramps up visa restrictions. Administrators did not disclose any details about grading. 
American University
AU will offer classes in a “blended combination” of online and in-person courses. All classes will be taught online after Thanksgiving break. No details have been disclosed about grading. 
The Catholic University of America
Many classes will be held in a hybrid format. Some classes will only have in-person sessions, while others may only be online; some classes will rotate between in-person and online learning. Students will be able to change a letter grade to pass-fail by Nov. 13 if they choose. On-campus instruction will conclude Thanksgiving break. 
The George Washington University
Most classes will be held in a hybrid format with online learning options for students who cannot attend in-person classes. In-person instruction will end Thanksgiving break and the university will host two weeks of virtual instruction to cap off the semester. GWU will hold classes Labor Day and cancel fall breaks. Students will have the option to take classes online if they do not feel comfortable returning to campus. No details have been disclosed about grading. 
Howard University
Howard will host classes in a hybrid format with in-person and virtual learning options. Some courses, such as those that focus on lab work or performances, may not have online options. The plan does not include details about grading. 
What health protocols will be put in place?
Georgetown University
Everyone on campus will be required to wear a mask and socially distance. Campus spaces will be cleaned regularly. All students will be tested for COVID-19 before initially coming to campus and must regularly document their symptoms through a mobile app or online questionnaire. The university will provide masks and other personal protective equipment to students.

All CUA faculty, staff and students will be required to wear a face mask and socially distance on campus. All students will be required to take a COVID-19 test seven days before returning to campus and monitor their health and possible symptoms daily through a digital “daily health checker.” The university is working to develop a testing center on campus. 
The George Washington University
Everyone on campus will be required to wear a face covering and practice social distancing. Campus spaces will be cleaned regularly. All community members will be required to receive seasonal influenza vaccinations. GWU also plans to expand telehealth capabilities, introduce an in-house testing program and implement symptom monitoring systems.
Howard University
Everyone on campus will be required to wear a face mask and socially distance while in public. Members of the Howard community will be required to take a COVID-19 test seven days before returning to campus. All students, faculty and staff will also have to self-monitor for symptoms and document various health indicators daily through an app or digital questionnaire.

Has tuition changed?
Georgetown University
Administrators have not commented on a possible tuition change.

What are you doing to protect the surrounding areas? There are lots of at-risk and elderly residents in the surrounding neighborhoods. How will you ensure that students are following guidelines? Students are still going to gather in big groups and some will neglect to wear masks when around others. 
How will Georgetown support physical and mental wellbeing of staff and students? There is a serious need to increase mental health resources.
