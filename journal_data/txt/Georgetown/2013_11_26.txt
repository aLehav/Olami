	School of Foreign Service Dean Carol Lancaster has been diagnosed with a brain tumor and will be away from campus in the coming weeks to seek treatment, according to a campus-wide email sent from the Office of the President on Tuesday night.  
	Senior Associate Dean James Reardon-Anderson will step up as acting dean and will be aided on faculty affairs by Jeff Anderson, chair of the SFS faculty.
	Lancaster has been dean of the SFS since 2010 and served as interim dean for one year before assuming the position. She graduated from the SFS in 1964. 
	In his email, DeGioia extended his thoughts and prayers for Lancaster’s speedy recovery. Students who wish to send Lancaster well wishes can email or send letters to the SFS Dean’s Office in Intercultural Center 301.
