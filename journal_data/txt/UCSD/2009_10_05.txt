Campus burglaries and auto 
thefts each decreased by roughly 
50 percent  last year, according 
to the 2009 Clery Report — released by the UCSD Police Department on Oct. 1. The report pro-vides statistics on reported campus crimes and arrests, 
along with disciplinary referrals, made in 2008.
Reported burglaries went down 
from 91 in 2006 to 53 in 2008, while the number of reported vehicular

Now that Muir College’s two primary 
cafeterias, El Mercado and Sierra Summit, are out of commission — the former per-manently and the latter temporarily, for renovations — one would imagine that an avalanche of growling stomachs would be bursting through the doors of at nearby dining halls Plaza Cafe and Oceanview Terrace.
However, according to Associate 
Director of Housing, Dining and Hospitality Steven Casad, students from Muir’s formerly crowded cafeterias are actually disseminating cleanly into the other dining halls.
Oceanview Terrace is accomodating 
the largest portion of Muir dwellers, at 22 percent. 
Taking a close second is the brand-
new Goody’s Place and Market, which has absorbed roughly 18 percent of Muir’s residents — followed by Plaza with 10 percent and Cafe Ventanas with 6 per-
cent. 
Associate Director of Housing, Dining 
and Hospitality Steven Casad said that there is always a period of heavier traffic 
in the dining halls during Fall Quarter, 
which he attributes to administrators Closure of Sierra Summit, 
Mercado means heavier Fall Quart er traffic
at other campus eateries.

The Clery 
Report can be found at www.police.ucsd.edu.U C President Mark G. Yudof met with student newspa-
per staff and A.S. representatives this weekend at the UC Irvine Student Center. According to UC spokes-
man Lynn Tierney — who played hostess at the meeting — it was the first president-student meeting in about 40 years.
The rendezvous took place around a small 
conference table bordered by spongy bagels, assorted jams, individually-packaged teabags and exotically-labeled coffee. After entering the room and introducing himself to staff members from the Southern California UC newspapers, Yudof seated himself at the head 
of the table behind a Coca-Cola Zero and an empty glass. 
“Thanks for coming on a Saturday, ” he said. “I know you 
have better things to do. ”
UC Irvine Chancellor Michael Drake entered behind Yudof, 
introducing himself and taking a seat on the president’s right.
“I need a copy of the blue folder, ” Yudof said, pouring himself 
the Coke. “Y ou all know Chancellor Drake? Any problems here, at Irvine, I just want you to know it’s all his fault. For the record. ”
Drake laughed.

A former campus parking-
enforcement officer is claiming that 
UCSD Parking and Transportation operates on an illegal ticket-quota system — allegedly forcing staff to hand out a minimum number of tickets every day. 
“They don’t say you have to give 
out so many tickets, but if you don’t meet whatever number, they chastise you and tell you to get your numbers up, ” former officer Kenneth Brennan said. “They start harassing people, and they start giving out tickets that they wouldn’t normally give out … That’s not right. ” 
Brennan, who was employed by 
UCSD for over 20 years, said an unofficial quota system forces park-ing officers to give out tickets for

“If someone’s over the line a lit-
tle bit, normally the department wouldn’t give a ticket out, ” Brennan said. “If someone pays $7 for an all day pass and accidentally parks in an ‘ A ’ spot, that shouldn’t be a cita-tion, it should be a warning. ” 
Brennan said he suspected his 
supervisor encouraged him to hand out parking citations rather than focus on his own job specialty — to investigate disabled-placard abuse and fraud — because fines collected for parking tickets go to the univer-sity, whereas fines from disabled-placard abuse are paid into a San Diego County fund. 
Brennan claimed he was fired 
because he wasn’t issuing a five-a-day minimum of parking citaitons.
“My supervisor, Marty 
[Greenawalt], told me I wasn’t bringing any money in, ” he said. “They don’t even care about the handicap violations. ” 
Quota ticketing sys-
tems are prohibited under the California Vehicle Code, which states that no agencies “may estab-lish any policy requiring (a) quota (for) arrests (or) citations. ” 
Brennan further 
alleged that his supervi-sors sent out monthly e-mails listing how many tickets each officer had issued — another practice that is prohibited under California state law. 
Brennan said that in the past, the 
department would offer prizes — 
such as iPods or cameras — to the officers who issued the most parking tickets during a particu-lar time period. 
“They print a sheet 
and e-mail it to each per-son and compare each person, ” he said. “ And that’s wrong. I know two officers that were threat-ened [with losing their jobs] already. These peo-ple are afraid to admit things. ” 
Two UCSD parking-
enforcement officers 
contacted for this story refused to comment. 
Director of Parking  and 
Transportation Brian D’ Autremont also denied comment, but provided the following statement: 
“There is no quota system at 
UC San Diego regarding any type of parking or transportation cita-tion. Several departments, includ-ing the Transportation Services Department, participated in a cam-pus incentive award program in 2005 through 2007 in which the names of exemplary employees who were nominated by their supervi-sors were entered into a monthly drawing to win either a camera or an iPod. The program was discon-tinued in 2007 because of budgetary constraints. ”

crimes decreased from 75 in 2006 to 
30 in 2008.
In contrast, arrests involving 
narcotics went up from 36 in 2006 to 60 in 2008. Similarly, the alcohol-related offenses have made a steady increase: 34 arrests in 2006, 100 in 2007 and 131 in 2008. 
UCSD Police Chief Orville King 
said the decrease in burglary and vehicle theft is not only a trend on the UCSD campus and surrounding communities, but within the region of San Diego County as a whole.
King does not attribute the 
decline in theft to any particular program implemented by the UCSD or San Diego Police Department, but to increased public awareness of neighborhood crime.
He said the community is more 
informed than before on how to avoid being victimized by burglary and theft, and individuals are more likely to report these instances when they do occur. 
King attributes the surge in 
drug- and alcohol-related offenses since 2006 to increased security at UCSD’s Sun God Festival. He says that the majority of such arrests on campus occur at large, campuswide events like Sun God.
King expects the security tactics 
employed by the UCPD at this year’s festival  to be similar to those used 
last year.
The Clery Report contains 
information pertaining not only to crimes occuring on the UCSD cam-pus, but also to those in surround-ing areas. 
However, the report is compiled 
primarily for UCSD students, fac-ulty and staff.
The Clery Report is federally 
mandated by the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Crime 
Statistics Act, which requires insti-tutions of higher learning to publish an annual report containing crime statistics. It was previously known as the Federal Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act.

feverishly hiring student staffers dur-
ing Week One and training them Week Two — right when the demand for food hits its peak.  
As for Muir-related traffic, Casad 
said Goody’s has helped ease the added pressure.
“We knew that the business 
we had [in Muir] was going to go somewhere else, ” Casad said. “That’s why we built Goody’s. It’s the clos-est building we had that we could take over, and we could spend some money that wasn’t going to be just thrown away. ”
So far, the new market — mod-
eled after El Mercado and located in Thurgood Marshall College — has been a popular destination for stu-dents. It offers Chipotle-style bur-ritos and a full salad bar, as well as sandwiches and desserts. 
“The kids love it, ” Casad said.  
“[There is] speedy service — by the time you stand at the first person saying ‘What do you want? Y ou want a burrito, a bowl or a salad?’ From there it’s a minute, a minute and a half to get through.  So the long line is a long line, but it’s really fast. ”
Revelle College freshman Steve 
Lopez is a fan.  
“I’ve had it, like, five times 
already, ” Lopez said.  “[I like] the burritos — that’s what everybody gets when they go there.  It actually does get pretty trafficky … [but] I would still recommend it, ’ cause it’s, like, six bucks, and it tastes really good. ”
The market is one of the few 
late-night options available on cam-pus, remaining open until 1 a.m. Oceanview Terrace, — previously the go-to for late-night Mexican grub on campus — now closes at 9 p.m. nightly.  
“I [do] like the burritos [at 
Goody’s], ” Muir sophomore Jessica Y aros said.  “But I guess [Housing and Dining] thought that since they opened that, they would shut down the Mexican food area in OVT, so there’s really nowhere to get good quesadillas anymore. ”
Marshall resident Conely Cha 
said she has noticed a slight swell in OVT’s population.
“OVT is crowded, especially dur-
ing lunchtime, ” Chan said.  “Usually the lines are very long, and even then, though there are four cashiers, there’s only usually one or two that are open …[but] it’s not that big of a deal. ”
Nevertheless, Casad assured that 
the new Muir dining halls —expected to commence construction in January 2010 and re-open Fall Quarter 2010 — will be well worth the wait.
“It’s going to be twice as big as 
it was before, ” Casad said. “I really want to make it a vegetarian/vegan location. Our population of vegans/vegetarians is very vocal, so I want to give them a place to say, ‘This is your place. ’ There’s no meat. It’s all 
green, it’s all fresh — it’s all vegan/vegetarian. ”
Casad said that Housing and 
Dining also has a new market in the works, which will be located across from the Village at North Torrey Pines — UCSD’s new transfer-housing com-plex — and is slated to open in 2012. 
Adjacent to the proposed market 
will be a sit-down restaurant where students can order high-quality meals — possibly accompanied by a beer and wine menu for cusltomers of age — with their meal cards.
“I want to go one more level that 
allows you, on campus, to have a nice experience — to have a date, ” Casad said. “So you don’t have a car, you don’t have to take the bus, you don’t have to go off-campus … We want to give you an opportunity to sit down and have a nice meal. ”

  or    lajollaFf orgLots of people have the idea that evangelical Christians 
think sex is inherently dirty, sinful, perhaps a necessary 
evil, but certainly not to be appreciated and enjoyed.  
But just the opposite is true.  Secular research has shown 
that couples who enjoy their sexual relationship the most 
are married evangelical Christians.  Surprised?  You shouldn’t be, and 
here’s why.
Sex was God’s idea in the first place.  He created us male and female 
for a reason!  He made sex to be pleasurable as well as powerful.  Sex 
is powerful, both in its ability to profoundly unite two people and also 
in its creative potential in bringing new life into the world.  When a 
couple commits in love “to have and to hold, from this day forward, for 
better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, till 
death do us part,” they are declaring to one another, before God and 
their family and friends, that they are taking responsibility for one another in love, no matter what the future brings.  That is exactly the 
context of committed love that God intends for the fulfillment of our sexual nature.  And that’s why, when we are rightly related to God and totally committed to our spouse, sex can be wonderfully satisfying.
Looking at the university campus scene, obviously there’s a lot of sex 
happening.  But is it really satisfying?  Ninety-one percent of college 
women nationwide say that “a hook-up culture” defines their campuses.  A report entitled “Hooking Up, Hanging Out, and Hoping 
for Mr. Right:  College Women on Mating and Dating Today” indicates 
that casual sexual encounters are a large part of college life.  A 
“hook-up” is defined as when a girl and a guy get together for a 
physical encounter but don’t necessarily expect anything further.  
Hook-ups almost always happen when both have been drinking or are drunk.  According to the Independent Women’s Forum, 40% of the women surveyed had experienced a hook-up, and one in ten reported 
having done so “more than six times.”  But 63% of the women want to 
meet a future husband at college and 83% say that marriage is a major 
life goal.
Radio and television commentator Dr. Drew Pinsky has pointed out 
that the desire women have for commitment in the face of so many 
sexual encounters suggests that college women are afraid to assert 
their true wishes.  Dr. Drew once said on ABC News’ Good Morning 
America that the college campus is a young man’s perfect world.  “For 
the men,” he said, “this is a very comfortable situation.  I tour the 
country and speak to colleges all across the land, and I’ll tell you that 
women are at best ambivalent about that and very commonly 
disillusioned.”  Doesn’t sound very fulfilling to me.  You and I weren’t 
created to mate like dogs, in meaningless serial relationships.  We are made in the image of God, and He has higher, more exalted purposes 
for us.
Perhaps the college sex scene is like the Emperor’s New Clothes.  Con 
artists had convinced the Emperor and his court that the clothes they 
were spinning for the Emperor were of purest gold, but they could only be seen by those who were wise.  Of course, the Emperor wanted to 
be wise, so when they fit on him the non-existent clothes, he pretended to see them and admire them.  His court, also not wanting to be thought fools, pretended to see them as well.  Finally, in the 
majestic parade through town, as the Emperor walked in his 
underwear, all the citizens pretended to see the clothes, too.  All, that is, except one, who said, “Hey!  The Emperor doesn’t have any clothes 
on!”  Maybe it’s time for some courageous UCSD women and men to 
wake up and be honest: “Hey!  Something’s wrong with the way we’re 
doing sex!”  Got the guts?“Y ou should write that; I want to see your 
pens going. It’s all my fault. Write that. ”
Then the room sobered up, and Yudof 
launched into a 20-minute presentation about 
the university’s current financial crisis, complete with blue and gold folders filled with colorful charts and graphs. 
After he finished, he invited questions from 
the students journalists present.
UC Irvine New University : Y ou talked a lot 
about the new financial-aid program and how it’s going to help students out. But for families above $180,000 who have more than, you know, one child — maybe like, two or three kids that they’re trying to send through the UC — that’s still going to be an extreme financial hardship for them.
Yudof: It could be ... There’s some scholar-
ship money. There’s scholarship programs that we don’t really control — that’s Cal grants, pri-marily. But you’re right, that’s true. But my way of thinking is: We only have so much money. We have to take care of the poorest kids first. There’s some money that comes from — well, not so much the Pell, but probably the Cal Grants and maybe some freestanding scholarships — but, that’s right. It will be tough for those who have five children and are making $180,000 a year. It will be tougher. Because really the federal and state financial-aid programs, by and large, don’t kick in. Y ou know, we only have so much money. And it’s very hard for me to justify putting much money to those above $180,000 when I can’t cover all the people under $100,000. That’s the reality.
Y ou know, we’re not anywhere 
near the highest rates in the country. If you look at Penn State, Illinois, and other — I think we’re a better institution, but we’re not at the highest rate by any stretch. Our problem is that the cost of living is higher in California. Many of our campuses — you know, Westwood and so forth — are fairly pricey places to be, when you actually look at the fee structure. The other thing some universities do, just to lay out some alternatives: In Michigan and Virginia they take huge numbers of nonresidents and they charge them full rate at $30,000 a year. And we have not done that, because we feel that we’re quintessentially a California institution, so we’re like 94 or 95 percent resident students, and I’m not willing to really bump up the nonresidents because I think our first duty is to Californians, because that’s who’s paying the taxes. Now, I wish they’ d pay a little bit more in taxes, to sup-port us, but they’re not willing to do that. So other universities are more expensive or have enrolled huge numbers of nonresidents and just charged them a ton of money, and we haven’t really done that.
The UCSD Guardian : Y ou’ve defended high 
executive salaries by arguing we must offer com-petitive pay to retain talented executives. What exactly would happen if you settled for less ‘competitive’ candidates, and is retaining more ‘competitive’ executives worth pushing students out of the university?
Yudof:  Well, there’s an unloaded question. 
The first big lie is that the executives have been getting raises during this — it’s just not true. Everyone at the Office of the President, includ-ing me, is paid 10 percent less. Second: If you didn’t have me, and I just went off and practiced law in Philadelphia or did something like that, you don’t save enough money to balance this budget. It’s very little money compared to the total number. Third: Most of the people paid over $200,000 are physicians. They’re not even paid out of state dollars. They treat patients at clinics. They staff our hospitals. That’s probably two-thirds, 70 percent, of all people paid over $200,000. Y ou know, you’re a surgeon, and you treat a patient, and the insurance company pays, and they pay a portion of your salary — that’s 
most of the executive salaries. Fourth: we’re not 
competitive. Our chancellors’ latest pay cut is 40 percent below market. It’s already 40 percent below market. There. Someone needs to run these operations. I’m sorry, but hospitals need medical directors. Campuses need chancellors. And it makes a difference — and we’re already paying 30 or 40 percent below market — you want to pick the best people you can. I picked a woman, Susan Desmond-Hellmann, to be 
head of UCSF — first woman to be head of that 
campus. I paid her about 25 percent of her prior salary. She has on her plate — she has to raise money for a $1.8 billion hospital. Why should I pick someone that I’ll pay $50,000 less, who may be unsuccessful raising the funds for that hos-pital. And that’s the problem. If California were out of control, if the UC were out of control — if we had extravagant executive salaries — we don’t. The Office of the President has actually cut $60,000 out recently. I mean, I just think this is fantasyland. The fantasy is you have overpaid executives and if you stopped it, you wouldn’t have to raise fees or have furloughs. The fantasy is we have reserves, which we don’t have. And you don’t have to do these things because you can just dig into this pot of gold. These are just make-believe. The reality is: We’re paid below market salaries. We probably should have higher salaries, but we don’t, and we make do.
Drake: I just want to make a commentary, 
to make sure that we’re clear. When I mentioned that we’re the best public research university system in the world, that’s because it’s true. And the difference between ‘ A ’ and ‘ A+’ is really huge. And I’ll say that for the people who we have here on campus — the quality of our professors and 
the people that help lead the cam-pus — when we get the best people, they make grand decisions and they make us the best in the world. When we deviate from that, we then sink down from where we are. We got to be who we are by hav-ing the best people and supporting them in doing their best work, and that’s the difference between ‘ A ’ and ‘ A+’ .
The UCLA Daily Bruin:  I 
understand what you’ve been saying about executive pay, just to go back to that subject, but regarding the recent New York Times  interview 
you had, where your salary was compared to that of the President of the United States, who makes $400,000 a year — I understand that your comments were facetious, but I was just wondering if you had any additional comments.  
Yudof:  I don’t have any addi-
tional comments. Y ou know I had a zany interviewer, and I gave her zany answers. And the truth is, if you threw in the White House, a 747 and a lifetime pension of 
$400,000, I’ d certainly take the job — although in my opinion, it’s not a job I’ d want to hold. It’s a pretty tough job that President Obama has. But I don’t know what to say. Do you know how much your dermatologist is paid, or how much your surgeon is paid, or how much your internist is paid? They’re all paid more than the president of the United States. It’s a very different sort of job, apparently. There are markets. And the way to recruit a Nobel Laureate person, you know — we have to pay the market. There aren’t markets for presidents. I’m less well off than I was at the University of Texas. It doesn’t matter; I don’t feel underpaid or anything. But the point of the matter is, the president of the local bank is probably paid more than the President of the United States, and so on. The president’s job is to be generous — it’s unique. But there are markets at all sorts of levels, and we’re below market. Our top-paid chancellor, among the research uni-versities, is something like 50th out of 62 — our top-paid chancellor. If you want to get serious, take a look at the president’s salary at Michigan. Take a look at the University of Texas. There’s a market. And then you compare it, and then you can decide whether we’re overpaid. And then write to the Board of Regents, because they set my salary. They won’t let me set my own; I’ d pre-fer to set my own, but they won’t let me.
The UCSD Guardian : So would you be will-
ing to accept a lower salary, maybe as a gesture?
Yudof: I did. I cut my salary 10 percent.
The UCSD Guardian : I mean, like, lower 
than it is now.
Yudof: Y ou know, I’ d consider anything, but 
markets are markets, and at some point you will cut out the good people. And you’re not going to cut your way into resolving this budget. I mean, I’ll consider anything at the appropriate time. But, um, I think this idea — why would you want to do that?
The UCSD Guardian : As a gesture.
Yudof: I already did my gesture. Did you do 
yours?
The UCSD Guardian : We pay higher stu-
dent fees.
Yudof: What sort of gesture do you want? 
I’ve done two gestures. We actually took a pay cut before everybody else in June, and another pay cut in September. These are gestures. It’s below market. The chancellors had to do the same thing — it was a gesture. How many ges-
tures do you want?

There comes a defining instant 
in every student’s life at which he can no longer stomach that 
1,000th Subway foot-long. After only a week back at school, my moment of taste bud evolution has already arrived. Having passed my threshold for premade provisions, only one solution remained: attempt to cook.
My past culinary efforts have been 
no more courageous than tossing a premade Trader Joe’s burrito in the microwave or mixing marinara with pasta. Over the years I’ve been so con-ditioned to seek instant gratification from fast, over-the-counter eats that I couldn’t imagine myself sauteing or mincing — or any of those other things cooks do in kitchens. 
I do, however, come from a family 
of hardcore foodies. My grandmother is the queen. In her house, food is a cure-all. Tough day at work? Lentil soup. Twisted your ankle? Beef kabob and herb rice with a glass of red wine. If there aren’t plumes of steam and exotic aromas wafting through the house, it’s either because her soap operas are on, or it’s 3 a.m.
No cooking endeavor could be 
properly executed without my grand-ma’s wisdom. So I made the call and asked her for recipes that fit the fol-lowing guidelines: healthy, simple to make (under 15 minutes of prepara-tion), composed of affordable ingredi-ents and possessing some internation-al flair. A little over a minute of deep consideration and she asked: “How about some grilled-chicken couscous salad and cream-of-broccoli soup?” 
Next thing I knew, I was standing 
in the fresh produce section of Trader Joe’s, far from the comfort of the frozen-foods aisle. I couldn’t help but doubt my commitment to cooking as I picked out what I thought were ripe Roma tomatoes. Was I really about to waste all this time and effort when I could just as easily swipe my debit card at Croutons and call it a day? 
On the ride home from TJ’s, I 
tried to reason my decision to cook. Forget the obvious economic benefits of making one $30 grocery trip for healthy, fresh food rather than what might amount to three separate $10 burrito runs on a daily basis — I was equally excited by the fact that my soon-to-be cooking skills would instantly make me more attractive. 
After all, what’s sexier than a home-cooked meal? 
With newfound 
motivation, I began dicing the tomatoes, onions and bell pep-
pers with a sense 
of purpose I had previously only 
exhibited while playing sports or debating politics. After glancing at my haphazard collection of vegetable bits, I learned my first cooking les-son: Wielding a knife like Grandma requires a sense of confidence, tech-nique and dexterity that can only be acquired after years of practice.
Thankfully, the rest was so easy 
that tomato dicing was half the battle. All I had to do was pour a packet of couscous into the saucepan (note: opening packets is easy) and add two   Kitchen

NATIONAL NEWS —  President 
Obama announced last Monday that 
schools should have longer days and shorter summer vacations, to increase our global competitiveness. And while the majority of American media networks stand in agreement — Fox News included — the U.S. should be cautious not to crash and burn in an overreaching attempt to catch up with international education standards.
While no bills have yet been draft-
ed, Obama has proposed that schools stay open later, and over the weekend, to raise the national standard for American children.
But there’s no telling whether a 
longer school day would accomplish that lofty goal. A 2007 study from the National Center for Education Statistics, published through the U.S. Department of Education, shows that 12th graders in other countries who spend less time in school are — on national average — still outscoring American children in math and sci-ence.
European countries average 
one hour of schooling less than the U.S. each day. Still, 14 out of the 20 countries sampled in the study (rang-ing from Australia to Switzerland to France) outperformed American students.
Major studies from private groups 
such as the Knowledge is Power Program — a network of college-preparatory schools that aim to help low-income students achieve col-
lege admission — are inconclusive 
in showing whether longer school hours would increase test scores (not to mention collective national intel-ligence) on the grander scale.
Using math scores from other 
countries, the Brookings Institution has the most convincing argument for extending the school day’s length: Its study suggests that an extra 10 min-
utes for students to ask questions is all 
it takes to eliminate the gap in math proficiency. Y et the same study shows that when 13 countries decreased their instruction time, the U.S. was one of only three countries in which test scores did not go down. 
It’s clear: Time limitations aren’t 
the sole influence on our academic performance.
Plus, it would be unhealthy to 
work our kindergarteners to the bone. A study for the Journal of Pediatrics led by Dr. Romina M. Barros, pedia-trician and assistant clinical profes-sor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, explains that a child’s brain often needs a break, and that down-time is just as important as studying. 
Even if test scores did rise in 
accordance with the longer school day, sacrificing hours of socializing in exchange for lecturing, reading and memorizing would be a step in the wrong direction. The United States is unique in its cultural output and inventiveness — grilling students on long division for an extra hour each week won’t breed the next Steven King or Bob Dylan. 
Class time may also cut into the 
hours that kids spend bonding with their families and friends. According to the Child Development Institute, building social skills is essential to developing a conscience, learning the importance of communication and culture and being valued in a group. 
U.S. Secretary of Education Arne 
Duncan, who supports Obama’s push 
for an extended school day, said that 
the current school calendar is out-dated and based on the old agrarian lifestyle that required kids to be out of school so they could  lend a hand on the farm. But the Afterschool Alliance, a nonprofit working to ensure the quality of after-school pro-grams, claims that after-school activi-ties are beneficial to learning because 
they create social connections. Even if 
our school schedule is based on an old way of life, the chess clubs and track teams of today have replaced the rak-ing and hoing of the good old days. 
A longer school day would neces-
sitate higher teacher salaries and a larger workforce to keep schools open for more hours. Programs in Massachusetts under the expanded class time initiative showed that it costs an additional 12 percent to 15 percent per student to add an extra class. Most school districts are gasping for breath under the current budget crisis; increasing the current workload would cause further economic strain. Not worth it — especially when stud-ies show it probably wouldn’t even raise test scores.
Summer school is no longer just 
a form of remediation for slower kids on the playground. Parents send their kids to summer school to prevent them from forgetting what they’ve already learned, to catch up where they’re struggling and to get ahead for the upcoming year. 
In fact, according to a study by 
the Northwest Regional Education Laboratory, summer school offers a great chance for both gifted students and those who have fallen behind to explore subjects in greater depth. Rather than increasing mandatory school hours for all, we first should expand tutoring and extra-learning options for those students who need and want it most during summer hours.
After all, there’s no point in 
forcing kids to stare at a board for a couple more hours while they text their friends below desktops.
Granted, the govern-
ment already has money set aside for tutoring low-income students. The No Child Left Behind Act, in place since 
2002, requires schools to 
spend 20 percent of their Title-I federal-grant money on tutoring services at high-poverty schools. Schools in Washington D.C., for instance, have been able to spend $1,700 on each low-income student in need of tutoring. Expanding that funding for tutoring to cover higher-income schools as 
well would increase the incentive 
to  help to close the interna-tional achievement gap, and 
provide more focused attention on students who need it most. 
Although no estimates have 
been released as to the cost of the president’s plan, a more tutoring-intensive approach would likely prove less expensive than a general time increase. Schools would be expanding programs already set in place under NCLB, and would only target those with a demonstrated need or desire for more classroom attention. 
While sweeping classroom change 
is certainly not out of the question, following through with Obama’s pro-posal too hastily would be unwise, given that longer school hours haven’t yet proven themselves to be the answer. We must first emphasize stu-dents’ varying individual needs before applying a one-size-fits-all band-aid to public education. Quantity doesn’t always mean quality.

Dear Editor,
Spanish is the only other world 
language besides English. Escuela 
Superior de Administracion y Direccion de Empresas (Spain), El Instituto Panamericano de Alta Direccion de Empresa (Mexico), Tecnologico de Monterrey (Mexico) and INCAE (Costa Rica) are ranked first, third, seventh  and 10th, 
respectively, in the The Wall Street Journal’ s list of top international 
business schools. The Ross School of Business (University of Michigan), the Tuck School of Business (Dartmouth College), the Tepper School of Business (Carnegie Mellon University), the Columbia School of Business (Columbia University)  and 
the Haas School of Business (UC Berkeley) are the top-five business schools in the United States. 
A total of 4,125  corporate recruit-
ers from Europe, Central and North America rank the schools for The Wall Street Journal’ s list. What makes 
the journal article accurate is that those same recruiters will be hiring the next batch of MBAs in Europe, Central America and North America. 
China’s history with the MBA 
dates back to 1994 when the China Europe International Business School opened. The job market for graduates in China isn’t very good, so they must start thinking of where to get jobs and who in the world will hire them.
The MBA is now considered a 
standard for international manage-ment,  but the Chinese have a ways to 
go. Their view of the education pro-cess and the MBA in particular differs greatly from that of Western culture. Usually, we see that when the econ-omy is doing well in the West, there are fewer private enrollments in MBA courses, but when the economy is booming, more companies can afford to send their executives to study. But in China, there is not that concern (it is not a boom or bust economy), and businesses will not cut down on funding executives from attending the ever popular Executive MBA (which is slightly misleading since it is little more than a holiday for the execu-tives of Chinese companies). 
Language is also very much a 
problem for the Chinese applicant to the west, and lack of work experience (which is a requirement for some B-schools) is actually a hindrance. Countries like the U.S., Britain and Canada scrutinize visa applicants closely, and there is a high degree of failure since the visa-granting officials determine whether applicants are not intending to return to China (and statistics support this belief).
My feeling is that China will 
import standards and apply situ-ational courses for disciplines like human resources, rather than build its own model, since re-engineering is already such a highly developed busi-ness in China. 
 The Chinese language, of course, 
has far more speakers than any other. Although these speakers are not as widely distributed worldwide as are speakers of English or Spanish.

cups chicken broth, one tablespoon 
olive oil, one-half teaspoon salt, and one-quarter teaspoon black pepper. Then I stirred the mix for about five minutes — fitting well within the con-fines of my culinary capacity.
After letting the hot couscous fluff 
in the broth, I added some pre-grilled chicken strips, two sloppily diced Romas and two tablespoons of Italian flat-leaf parsley, then garnished with some lemon juice and green onions. To my astonished delight, I had pro-duced a colorful salad that appeared to be a healthy and balanced entree — and it tasted at least as good as a $7 salad from the Sunshine Store.The soup proved just as simple. 
Melting the butter and sauteing the onions produced a confidence-inspiring aroma of onion-y goodness. Once the onions were transparent, I added one cup of water, the chopped bell pepper, the packet of broccoli and a teaspoon of salt. Then I covered the saucepan and let the concoction sit until the veggies had tenderized. Next, I liquefied the contents of the sauce-pan in the blender, adding milk inter-mittently until it looked like my sauce was smooth. From there, I emptied the blender back into the pan, added the remainder of the milk and topped it off with a few drops of soy sauce for added flavor. A garnishing of black pepper and a bay leaf for presentation, and voila! In less than half an hour — the same time it would’ve taken to buy and unfreeze the burrito for which I’ d always settled — I had a sumptuous-looking salad and steaming soup, with four days’ worth of leftovers to spare. 
Perhaps the best part of the whole 
experience was transferring the salad and soup into their respective bowls. I felt accomplished — almost euphoric. Maybe that’s why the food tasted so good. Of course, I’m nowhere remotely close to cooking (nor wield-ing a knife) like Grandma, and I’ d be lying if I called myself a cook, but the reward for simply trying was well worth my minimal effort.

The number of people who attended the first
Comic-Con in 1970, according to the San Diego Union 
Tribune. Last year, an estimated 140,000 people attended the four-day event.
E arly next Sunday morning — if you’re still awake after 
a night of debauchery — peer into the dawning atmo-sphere at 6:10 a.m. Against the fixed backdrop of dim blinking stars, look for a bright dot moving purpose-
fully across the sky. What appears to be a mere speck to the naked eye is really the size of a football field, spinning 200 miles above our heads at over 17,000 miles per hour. Y ou’ve landed on the International Space Station. 
Later this month, from Oct. 20 to Oct. 23, a Nikon 
Electronic Still Camera aboard the ISS will snap photographs of the Earth based on requests from middle-school students throughout the world. And facilitating the entire process — from school outreach to telling NASA when and where to take the pictures — is a group of 10 to 15 UCSD undergrads, serv-ing on the team as interns.
The images are taken as part of ISS EarthKAM, a NASA-
sponsored program that aims to educate young students about the Earth from the vantage point of space. 
According to Karen Flammer — research physicist who 
holds a doctorate in space physics and serves as the primary faculty advisor for the EarthKAM program at UCSD — the main focus of the project is to get young students excited about science. Flammer helps develop curriculum that revolves around the use of the images taken by EarthKAM for middle-school teachers and students. 
And although KAM stands for Knowledge Acquired by 
Middle Schools, elementary and high schools have also taken their places behind the camera.
According to Flammer, Photo requests to the EarthKAM 
Web site have included specific countries, land formations, weather patterns — even natural disasters. UCSD students then process these requests and transmit pertinent information to the International Space Station via NASA ’s Johnson Space Center.
Based on instructional files created by the undergrads, the 
camera then snaps photographs of the Earth. These images are transmitted to NASA for archiving before being sent back to UCSD to be uploaded to the EarthKAM Datasystem.
Within 24 hours of submitting their requests, middle-school 
students can access the Datasystem to retrieve their pictures. According to Flammer, they have used the images for school projects such as tracking disaster paths, mapping land area and calculating the size of farmland.
The program is likewise benificial for the participating 
UCSD students, who receive specialized training while to 
facilitating the successful completion of each mission. As a primarily research-funded university (cash-strapped as it currently may be), UCSD is most often touted for the cutting-edge innovations of its faculty and graduate students. But over on the first floor of the Science and Engineering Research Facility build-ing, you’ll find undergraduate scien-tists controlling a great portion of the background operations that make ISS EarthKAM so successful. Students work in teams dedicated to managing specific aspects of the program.
UCSD alumna Liz Kain, who was 
part of EarthKAM for four years before 
graduating in 2008, said the program is a valuable opportunity for undergraduates to be part of something substantive.
“The school team was speaking with and educating students 
from all over the world. We worked directly with people at Houston, at the Johnson Space Center. Y ou could listen to the austronauts. We developed a program that’s actually used on the International Space Station! We joke about looking up in the sky and saying, ‘Yup, [our work] is up there. ’”
Many of the participating UCSD students said they 
stumbled on the program while browsing the aerospace tab of

X-Men, the comic-book cash crop has been making the most of an endless harvest. In 
the past five years alone, there’s been enough Marvel-based movies to keep Tobey Maguire set for life.
Considering San Diego’s Comic-Con 
International brought in a record flock of cos-tumed geeks this summer, it’s only fair that we should also house one of best comic book stores in SoCal — an unpretentious cache in Clairemont with its own MySpace, book club, blog and assorted collection of plastic-encased Stormtroopers, appropriately named Comickaze.
By the time you finish parking and lift your 
gaze towards the over-crowded window staring you in the face, you’ll realize that Comickaze isn’t nearly as genteel nor spacious as the Barnes & Noble you’re used to. Judging by the over-jammed bookshelves, wire racks, countertops and windows, it’s outgrown its modest origins and opted for offbeat clutter a while ago. Boxes, box sets and the more popular members of League of Justice line the walls, while T-shirts with screenprints of Gabrielle from Xena (uh, I was 10) hang on racks propped up throughout the store. 
The infinite bric-a-brac, DIY crafts and 
miscellaenous merchandise are all part of Comickaze’s quaint appeal: offering more than comic books for those of us so uncommitted to collecting that we couldn’t tell you if $500 was a decent asking price for the first Venom cameo in the Amazing Spider-Man series. (According 
to eBay, it is.) Comics might be their specialty, and the first two syllables of their moniker — not to mention roughly 70 percent of their store — but they’re keen on everything from neon lights and glassware of Wonder Woman 
and Wolverine, to life-size busts and bookends  
of Hellboy.
In simple terms of comic books, Comickaze 
is stocked with all the extras: special editions, back issues and complete collections. Whether you’re pining the latest installment of the Umbrella Academy (written by Gerard Way of My Chemical Romance), the early issues of new medieval epic Mouse Guard  (complete 
with signed copies) or even one of the endless derivatives of a Stan Lee orginal ( Spider-Man 
Loves Mary Jane, Justice League: Cry for Justice ), 
Comickaze’s got enough pages to keep anyone in the store for hours.
Bookshelves wrapping the store walls host 
most of the selection, including nearly 25 shelves dedicated to Marvel alone. Eisner, Miller and Moore are a guarantee — and if there’s any-thing you want that they don’t have, they can usually order it for you. 
Imagine an abridged, less-pricey version of 
Comic-Con, crammed into a midsized retail store — minus the tawdry Tinkerbell — you’ve got a pretty good idea of what Comickaze feels like.
The only category it loses in is manga — 
which, compared to the UCSD Bookstore, only 
takes up a single wire rack. But when you con-sider how much you gain, it’s a small price to pay for a chance to escape the seedy confines of Price Center.

A SAPPHIRE IN THE ROUGH: YOUTUBE’S NEXT VIDEO VIXEN
BY ALYSSA BEREZNAK  SENIOR STAFF WRITER
Muir College senior Daniel McDonald ended 
his 21st birthday party in a wedding dress, crumpled below a Residential Security Officer’s 
feet in tears — but not because he was abandoned at the altar. 
He’ d begun the evening of Sept. 23 innocently, 
offering drinks to his guests in a corset and red tutu. But when his International House bash spilled out onto I-Walk, a couple uniformed men told everyone it was time to take it inside. McDonald was upset, so his roommate — Muir College junior Lee Montgomery — told him to make a statement. 
“I love that kind of thing, ” McDonald said. 
“Whenever I hear that, I’m like, ‘Oh yeah, let’s do that. ’”
So McDonald ran inside and threw on the $100 
wedding dress he and Montgomery had purchased together at a Pacific Beach thrift store. (Never mind that he didn’t have time to tie pillows on his legs to poof the dress out, as was the plan.) He grabbed a giant suitcase and rushed to the shutdown in hysterics, throwing his slender body to the ground and threaten-ing to move out, between sobs. 
The RSOs stared on, as bystanders on balconies 
snapped photos. 
“Everyone get off I-Walk!” one RSO shouted. 
“Except for the bride. Mind the bride. ”
All this from a pale, 6-foot, 128-pound blonde kid 
who calls himself an introvert.
“I never thought I [stood out] until like a year ago 
or so, ” McDonald said. “I’ve always kind of dressed like how I feel like dressing. And then people were like, ‘Gosh, Dan, you stand out so much. ’ And I was like, ‘Do I, really?’” 
McDonald is hard to miss. Y ou may have seen him 
walking to Earl’s Place covered in an amalgamation of rainbows. Or glimmering on Library Walk in a sil-ver sequined wrap. His bright platinum hair matches his bright yellow sandals, which match his yellow Volkswagon Beetle, which matches a yellow loofah he carries around as a fashion accessory.
“People always come up to me and say, ‘Oh, I love 
your costume, where are you going?’” McDonald said. “ And I’m like, ‘Oh, these are my clothes. ’ I always like to try new things. I’ve worn mismatched shoes before on purpose. So I’ll wear a loofah as an accessory and maybe eventually it will catch on, and soon you’ll see a bunch of girls on campus matching their outfits to loo-fahs. And I’ll be the trendsetter. Maybe. We’ll see. ”
But how does one become a mastermind trendsetter 
like McDonald in the first place?
It’s a long story. McDonald’s parents divorced three months after 
he was born. His mother Linda — who, according to McDonald, looks like a Swedish supermodel — then swept him away to San Diego. She tried her luck at love again, remarrying when McDonald was six, and then divorcing again when he was 12. At one point, they shared an apartment with McDonald’s grandmother in a shabby El Cajon neighborhood. Eventually, with the help of some child support from her two ex-husbands, they got their own place.
But by his senior year at Grossmont High School 
in La Mesa, Linda couldn’t pay rent. One evening, the cops came to their apartment, threw their belongings on the street and changed the locks. McDonald and his mother slept on the street next to a mound of their stuff.
The next morning, McDonald took charge. He 
called a taxi and directed the driver to his grandma’s house.
“I was like, ‘Mom, we can’t be like living on the 
street, ’” he said. “She’s not the most grounded person, so she kind of, like, didn’t realize what was happening. She’s a little eccentric. ”
Around the same time, McDonald’s friend Courtney 
invited him to Monster Massive — a colossal dance party that draws thousands of costume-clad ravers to the Los Angeles Sports Arena every Halloween. He accepted the invitation, since he already had a ward-robe for the occasion, and road-tripped up to LA for some fun. 
“I fit into it, ” McDonald said. “I super fit into it. 
When I was there, I was like, ‘Wow, these are my people. ’ Like, everyone was crazy dressed. Everyone was having a really good time. And everyone was happy. There was no arguing, you know?”

YOUR NEWS - 24/7the Academic Internship Program 
database. Others are friends of friends who found their way to Flammer’s office by word of mouth.
Though AIP interns receive aca-
demic credit, some students receive paid scholarships, and others choose to volunteer.
“It gives them the experience of 
a hands-on, space-related project, ” Flammer said. “Some even go on to work for NASA. ”
Christie Carlile, a 2009 UCSD 
alumna, is one such student.
“I went to space camp in the 5th 
grade and that sealed the deal, ” Carlile said.
Carlile was designated Chief of 
the UCSD Mission Operations Center — which is modeled after NASA ’s Mission Control — before becoming a “co-op, ” or participant in NASA ’s Cooperative Education Program. The program offers paid positions to col-lege students who juggle classes while working for NASA.
Five weeks ago, Carlile became 
a full-time employee of the Johnson Space Center.Sixth College senior Allen Jiang 
began as an AIP intern one year ago, but elected to stay on after his quar-ter with the Academic Internship Program ended.
Jiang said he feels EarthKAM pro-
vides an invaluable educational ser-vice to participating middle schools.
“It invigorates them and gets them 
involved in learning about the Earth and space. ”
Kain — who now works as a 
project manager at Apple but cred-its the trajectory of her career path to the undergraduate experience at EarthKAM — agreed.
“Sometimes you get direct feed-
back from kids and you feel like you’re perhaps inspiring future engineers or scientists, ” Kain said. “ And even if it’s only one kid, it’s gratifying. ”
The International Space Station 
will be visible in the early morning skies of San Diego from Saturday, Oct. 10 to Wednesday, Oct. 14. Check www.nasa.gov for exact times and durations.
Readers can contact Aprille Muscara 
at amuscara@ucsd.edu.Monster Massive was a night of 
many firsts for McDonald — includ-ing, but not limited to, trying ecstasy and meeting his rave parents: two lesbians named Cupcake and Stardust. They dubbed him Fluid, to describe both his sexuality and his dance style.
Accordingly, McDonald identifies 
as pansexual — a sexual orientation he describes as “fluid sexuality. ”
“It’s kind of like bisexual but bisex-
ual has this binary I don’t like: It limits you to two options, ” he said. “But not animals. I don’t like to fuck cabbages or cats or anything. ”
When he first arrived at UCSD, 
McDonald didn’t feel as comfort-able showing his true colors. He said he dressed more conservatively and was still dating his high-school girl-friend, who wasn’t too happy about his pansexuality. After their midyear breakup, he joined several Muir College organizations and became more flamboyant. 
But McDonald’s pinnacle of fame 
came when he spent a year abroad, from June 2007 to January 2008, in Sweden. With a new webcam and some free time on his hands, Swedish Sapphire (a stage character named after his national heritage and birth-stone) was born. McDonald filmed steamy remakes of whatever song he dug at the time — mostly of the Britney and Gaga nature — with a tiny camera, some careful angling and lots of costumes changes.
“I always thought Chris Crocker 
was cool, ” McDonald said. “He makes these crazy videos and then he posts them on Y ouTube. I figured I could too. And so I did. And I definitely advertised it. ”
One day, he joined the Swedish 
Y ouTube network, and suddenly became a mini-celebrity. His view count shot to 1,800, and at one point he held the No. 10 ranking on the country’s network. People even began to recognize him in public. 
Since then, McDonald has made 
about 34 videos — some of which all his family and friends have viewed (grandma got a peak at Thanksgiving dinner). Though he hasn’t reached Crocker’s celebrity status, he’s still rec-ognized locally.
“Last week, I was coming back 
form Earl’s Place, and this group of frat guys way behind me was like, ‘Swedish Sapphire, turn around, ’” he said. “I waved and they were like, ‘K, cool, thanks. ’”
Although McDonald hopes to 
continue filming projects on the side after he becomes an opthamologist (he interned with an eye doctor this summer and plans to apply to medi-cal school in 2011), he understands his side job might be difficult for his patients to swallow.
“I’m worried because once I get up 
to a professional level its going to be hard, ” McDonald said. “It might not be as accepting as it is now. And if the old lady whose eyes I’m fixing sees me on the Internet half-naked and is like, ‘Wait, that’s my eye doctor, ’ that might be a bit of a shock. ”
In the meantime, though, 
McDonald is waiting to hear back from Rich’s and Numbers — two gay clubs at which he auditioned for a go-go dancing position earlier this year. Y ou never know when the next wedding dress tantrum will precipitate — rumor has it McDonald is planning on a fishnet-clad weight-lifting session at RIMAC sometime this year. 
“I really like to have people ques-
tion reality and the norm, ” he said. “People live their mundane, everyday life, and all of a sudden they see some crazy drag queen running out of a tree, and its like, ‘Whoa. ’”

89Middle-school students use the 
EarthKAM Web site to submit photo requests, which are received by UCSD undergrads.
UCSD students group the requests 
together based on location. They then use student-programmed soft-ware to generate Camera Control Files that instruct the camera when to take the photographs. These files are sent to NASA ’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.
NASA verifies the CCFs and uplinks 
them to a laptop located in the Destiny Lab of the International Space Station.
The laptop reads the files and con-
trols the EarthKAM camera, which snaps the requested images at the times specified by the files.The unprocessed photographs are transmitted from the ISS to the JSC, where they are sent to UCSD’s Mission Control Center — as well as NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Lab.
The Jet Propulsion Lab archives the 
photographs for NASA.
UCSD students upload the images 
to the Datasystem, a searchable online database on the EarthKAM Web site.
The UCSD Orbits Team uses the 
images to check for any miscalcula-tions, and the Images Team does projects based on the photographs.
Middle-school students access their 
requested images from the Earth-KAM Web site and can use them in class activities.CLASSIFIEDS 	 MONDAY , OCTOBER 5, 2009 	 THE UCSD GUARDIAN  11

At the start of the second half, 
UC Davis got on the board when 
Matt Richardson converted on a man-up opportunity — only to  have 
Madsen answer back with a goal of his own at the 4:17 mark, regaining UCSD’s lead. After the two teams traded goals again, with under three minutes remaining in the third, the Tritons entered the final period clinging to a 6-5 lead. 
In a nail-biting fourth quarter, 
senior utility Ian Bausback gave the Tritons a two-point advantage. The Aggies would find the net twice, more, however, tying the game for the fourth time when Colin Hicks punched in a five-meter penalty shot at the 2:45 mark. 
Refusing to yield to the Davis 
upswing, the Tritons put together a late surge when seniors Steven Donohoe and Roberts scored at the 2:25 and the 1:16 marks, respec-tively, to seize a victory.  
“Everyone on the team stepped 
up — it was a total team focus, ” Gresham said. “We had our first and second line both play really well tonight, and we were going six-for-six the whole game. This time, we were able to press a man and get the counterattack going the whole time. Everyone put forth that effort. When you know that the guy next to you is swimming hard, you have to swim hard too. ”  
The victory against UC Davis 
drives the Tritons into a stretch of five games over a three-day period, against some of the nation’s top   programs, from Oct. 9 through Oct. 11. 
After playing Chapman 
University in Orange, Calif., the Tritons will open the UC Irvine Invitational on Oct. 10 against Loyola Marymount University. The LMU Lions have been UCSD’s 
toughest opponent recently: They have won all of the last eight games between the two teams, dating back to the 2006 season.
The remaining competition at 
the invitational will be just as chal-lenging. The Tritons enter a tour-nament pool that includes pere-nial national powerhouses No. 1 Stanford University, No. 4 Cal Berkley and No. 8 Pepperdine. 
Madsen recognized the need to 
take the tournament’s first game in order to set the tone for their remaining matches. 
“It’s always important to win that 
first game so we can play with better teams, ” Madsen said. “In the south-ern california tournament, there’s always a lot of good teams — so we hope to go out there, play hard and get within those top-10 rankings. ” 
Readers can contact Brianna Lee at 
bmlee@ucsd.edu.After the goal, UCSD’s defense 
continued to shut out Sonoma State, and the Tritons held out for a 1-0 victory.
“Tonight, I thought we moved 
off the ball well, ” junior midfielder Lisa Bradley said. “I thought we had heart and wanted to win this game.  We kept the intensity up the whole 90 minutes. ”
With the victory, the Tritons’ 
record improves to 8-2 overall, with a 6-2 record in CCAA play. This was the third-straight win for the Tritons, who have won six out of their last seven matches. The victo-ry also extends UCSD’s dominance over Sonoma State, having taken 13-straight victories since 2000.
UCSD continued its home stand 
with a match against Humboldt State on Oct. 4, winning 2-1 to improve its season record to 9-2. The Triton goals were netted by freshman for-ward Gabi Hernandez, sophomore forward Courtney Capobianco and freshman defender Hayley Johnson, en route to a 3-1 victory. 
UCSD has scored 22 goals 
throughout its first 10 games this season. The Triton’s leading scorer is sophomore forward Sarah McTigue, who holds four of the Tritons’ 22 goals. 
The lack of a dominant scorer 
this season is a huge departure from last season, when former Triton senior forward Natasha Belak-Berger was the unquestioned leader of the team’s offense with 13 goals — one-third of the team’s total scoring — and three assists, for a total of 29 points. In contrast to last year, fresh-man midfielder Jessica Wi leads the 2009 Tritons with nine points with just under half of the season having already been played.
Though the team has no domi-
nant star, Bradley is confident in its ability to play as a balanced set of players and continue to improve as the CCAA championship playoffs on Nov. 6 draw closer.
“Our team has improved so 
much over the last couple of weeks, ” Bradley said. “From the defense to 
the midfield to the forwards, every-thing is definitely starting to come together. We are starting to feel comfortable with each other. ” 
Readers can contact John Beck at 
jbeck@ucsd.edu.
▶ W. SOCCER, MYVTWHNL
DANIEL  CADDELL /GUARDIAN
Sophomore forward Sarah McTigue has been one of the few UCSD players to put up any crooked 
offensive numbers this season, recording eight points on four goals in 25 shots.the Phillies, whose closer followed 
up a perfect 2008 season by going 0-8 with an ERA over seven and 11 blown saves. Added to the Phil’s wor-ries are the fact that a 102-year-old Jamie Moyer leads the team with 12 wins, and that Cole Hamels has more losses (11) than wins (10). If Charlie Manuel’s defending World Champions are going to make a run at another title, they will need veteran players like Jimmy Rollins and Cliff Lee to lead the charge and get the city of brotherly love charged up.
As for the Rockies, they have a 
real knack for miracle runs. Somehow topping 2007’s magical sprint to the World Series, the 2009 Rocks came within two days of win-ning the NL West and will glady enter the playoffs as the wild-card winner. On June 3 the Rockies were 15 1/2 games out of first place before Jim Tracy took over as manager and lead his team to a 73-40 record to finish out the season. After trading away franchise player Holliday in the off-season, Colorado’s offense was buoyed by all-star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and the ageless Todd Helton to slug 189 home runs — second-best in the NL. The main concern for the mile-highers is whether their young rotation can hold up under pressure. But with Jason Giambi’s mustache and gold thong waiting on the bench, the Rockies will surely provide some late-game theatrics. 
Blanc’s pick: Phillies in five games.American League:Detroit Tigers/Minnesota Twins vs. 
New York Yankees
Thanks to the Twins’ late-season 
push (and the Tiger’s inability to close out the AL Central), baseball fans are now treated to a one-game playoff to determine who takes on the New Y ork Y ankees in the AL Division Series. In what could pos-sibly be the final baseball game ever at Minneapolis’ Metrodome, the Twins will look to continue their September surge against a Tiger’s club that has controlled the division all season. Justin Verlander was needed Sunday to force Tuesday’s playoff, which means the charge now falls on one of Detroit’s rookie pitchers to contain Minnesota’s offensive attack. How Joe Mauer, the leading candidate for American League MVP , performs will be a primary factor in deciding the outcome between the two Midwest rivals.
Awaiting the winner of the 
Tigers-Twins game are the New Y ork Y ankees, who responded to last sea-son’s absence from the playoffs (the first time in 12 years) by spending $243.5 million on three free agents. Apparently money can buy you love — or at least a playoff berth — because the Y anks find themselves with the best record in baseball. How did the spending-spree babies per-form in 2009? CC Sabathia won 20 games, Mark Teixiera led the team in home runs (32) and RBIs (122) and A.J. Burnett struck out 195 batters in 207 innings. Money well-spent, Mr. Steinbrenner. With Mariano Riviera getting even more unhittable as he approaches AARP eligibility, the Y ankees are as threatening as they have been all decade.
Blanc’s pick: Y ankees in four 
games.
Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim vs. 
Boston Red Sox
Ever since the Angels destroyed 
every fiber in my being with their 
comeback win in the 2002 World Series against the Giants, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim’s Pasadena section of Laguna Beach have only won a single playoff series, seemingly losing in the Division Series every year to the very same team they face this year: the Red Sox. Following the tragic death of pitcher Nick Adenhart on April 9, the Halos have quietly put together an incred-ibly strong season. First 
baseman Kendry Morales has grown into one of the most well-rounded hitters in the game, and closer Brian Fuentes filled the spot left by Francisco Rodriguez after his record-setting 2008 season with 48 saves of his own to stabilize the Angel’s bull-pen. The fact that on Aug. 18 all nine Angels starters were batting over .300 is an ominous sign for any opposing pitchers in the playoffs.
It took David Ortiz 149 at-bats 
to hit his first home run of the year for Boston, but a career year from outfielder Jason Bay and the acqui-sition of Victor Martinez lent the Sox enough support to stave off the Rangers and claim the AL wild card. Starting pitcher Josh Beckett could never quite find a rhythm and an effective Daisuke Matsuzaka proved to be as much of a myth as his gyrob-all, leaving the young Jon Lester to anchor a pitching staff that, at times, buckled under the weight of the AL East. Unless Curt Schilling takes a break from his campaign for the U.S. Senate to re-bloody his sock, Boston is going to have a hard time getting out of the first round.
Blanc’s pick: Angels in four 
games.
So there you have it: foolproof 
predictions on who will make it to the NL and AL championship series. So call your bookies, place some bets and tune in again before the League Championship Series for the next installment of Blanc’s picks for the rest of the playoffs.
Unless Curt 
Schilling takes a break from his campaign for the U.S. Senate to re-bloody his sock, Boston is going to have a hard time getting out of the ﬁrst round.?Q\P6W/W<W;KWZMZ=+;,:MTQM[WV*ITIVKML)\\IKS

going into that match, ” Black said. 
“We had a good week of practice and game-planned well, but I’m not sure if we were there mentally. I just kind of reset and thought about what we needed to do after that. ”
UCSD held on to win the third set 
25-20 before battling out a fourth set to finish off Cal State Monterey Bay for the victory. The Tritons jumped to a 7-4 lead, but the Otters responded with a strong counter-run to take a 16-13 lead. 
After a timeout, the Tritons briefly 
reclaimed the lead — before falling behind 24-23. Sophomore outside hit-ter Katie Condon came off the bench and scored a quick hit to tie the game. After Cal State Monterey Bay fumbled the next point, senior captain out-side hitter Sylvia Schmidt notched her final and match-leading 15th kill to capture the 26-24 victory for the Tritons.
Saturday night, UCSD had no 
trouble dispatching San Francisco State, sweeping three straight sets, 25-15, 25-17 and 25-17. The Gators’ only lead of the night came when they took the first point in the second game for a quick 1-0 edge.
However, the game was all UCSD 
from then on, as Schmidt paced the Tritons to a dominant win by notch-ing16 kills on .583 hitting. 
“We were ready to go, ” Black said. 
“We weren’t going to make the same mistake as Friday. We served tough, and our blockers were pretty good about doing what they were trying to do. We just closed off any lanes for them to hit through. ”
UCSD goes on the road next 
weekend to face CCAA opponents Humboldt State on Oct. 9 and Sonoma State on Oct. 10.

Men’s Water Polo —  For the second 
time in the past two weeks, the 
No. 13 men’s water polo team took down conference rival UC Davis with an impressive 9-7 victory on Oct. 2 at the Coggan Family Aquatic Center. 
The Tritons’ record now stands 
at 6-7 for the season, while the No. 12 Aggies dropped to 9-5. 
“This was a big win in terms of 
confidence, and in terms of how our 
season has been going, ” senior two-
meter defender Peter Gresham said. “It’s important for us to see results for how hard we’ve been working in practice. ” 
The Tritons’ well-fought match 
serves as a heartening sendoff:  UCSD takes to the road all next week, facing Chapman University on Oct. 9 before participating in the 
UC Irvine Invitational Oct. 10 and 
Oct. 11.
“ After last week, when we lost 
to [Loyola Marymount], that was tough — so we wanted to come out and get this win to feel confident going into our southern california tournament next week, ” senior driv-er Bryce Madsen said. “[This] was a rival game too, so you always want to get the win just so that when it comes to [Western Water Polo Association] rankings, we’re ahead of them, and we have the easy way into the final. ”
Before triumphing in their 9-7 
win over the Aggies, the Tritons got off to a sluggish start, facing down a 3-0 deficit in the first period. 
However, Madsen turned in a 
solid performance, tallying three goals for UCSD — the first of which came at the 2:15 mark of the first 
quarter, putting the Tritons on the 
board. 
“Sometimes you’ve just got to get 
that first one in, ” head coach Denny Harper said. “I think that helped because it was like, ‘OK, we’re not shooting at a brick wall here. ’ No offense at Davis. Their defense is not as strong as [Loyola Marymount]. With two teams ranked side by side 
in the national rankings, that’s gen-
erally what happens. Essentially, the game went as I expected, and I’m glad we came out on top. ” After a scoreless first five min-
utes of the second quarter, the Tritons took a timeout to regroup — a strategy that would ultimate-ly change the tempo of the game in their favor. Senior driver Sean 
Roberts scored immediately after 
breaking the huddle, while a six-on-five opportunity at the 1:19 mark resulted in Madsen’s second goal of the game. With the game tied at 3-3, 
Gresham fired just before the end of the half, putting the Tritons up by a delicate 4-3 lead. 
“On our man-ups, they basically 
left me open, ” Madsen said. “I try to help my team in any way, so if 
they’re going to leave me open, I’m 
going to shoot it. ”

T       he 2009 baseball season was 
an interesting one. Aside from Randy Johnson win-
ning his 300th game, there were no major records broken (my apologies to Mark Reynolds, but re-setting your own single-season strikeout record isn’t exactly reason to celebrate). A pair of lefty pitchers who had lost a combined 20 games still managed to throw a no-hitter and a perfect game. 
No pitcher won 20 games on the sea-
son for only the second time in base-ball history. Three of baseball’s biggest sluggers — Alex Rodriguez, Manny Ramirez and David Ortiz — got caught using performance-enhancing drugs and now are living proof that baseball forgives everyone not named Barry by helping their teams win in the playoffs. 
At least we had Milton Bradley’s 
annual meltdown to reassure us that no matter how much changes in base-ball, some things never will.
The regular season has wrapped 
up, meaning that the time of the year we’ve all been waiting for is finally here. With the Division Series start-ing this week, the playoffs are upon us. So, with no further delay, I pres-ent the “Blanc On Base” 2009 MLB Division Series predictions:
National League:Los Angeles Dodgers vs. St. Louis 
Cardinals
Despite having the best record 
in the National League, the Dodgers limp into the postseason after almost surrendering the NL West with a five-game losing streak in the season’s final week. Matt Kemp and Andre Ethier posted monster numbers to pace LA to a team batting average of .270, but Manny the Tranny’s fall from offensive grace has resulted in some serious trouble at Chavez Ravine. The Dodgers’ probable play-off rotation gives manager Joe Torre a roadblock he never quite had in New Y ork. How far can a team go when Randy Wolf is your game one starter and your choices for game three include Jon Garland and Vicente Padilla?
The Cardinals, on the other hand, 
have a rotation anchored by Chris Carpenter and Adam Wainwright, two pitchers who will finish top three in the Cy Y oung race. With Joel Piniero performing well from the No. 3 spot and a breakout year from new closer Ryan Franklin, St. Louis eas-ily gets the edge over LA in pitching. As for offense, the Cardinals’ lineup may not be as well-balanced as the Dodgers’ , but with all-universe first baseman Albert Pujols finally hav-ing protection from outfielder Matt Holliday, the Cards are going to put up more than enough runs for man-ager Tony La Russa. 
Blanc’s pick: Cardinals in four 
games.
Philadelphia Phillies vs. Colorado 
Rockies
How can you have four players 
with over 30 home runs and two Cy Y oung-winning pitchers on your staff and still enter the Division Series with serious doubts? Just look at

onWOMEN’S SOCCER — Throughout the 2009 season, 
UCSD has been unable to find a consistent goal-scorer: 
Nine different players have scored no more than four times. With only one senior on the team, no Triton in particular has been counted on to put the ball in the net. 
This trend continued at UCSD’s Oct. 2 match against 
conference rival Sonoma State. This time, the player who provided UCSD’s game-winning goal came as an unexpected surprise to all those on the field: a Sonoma defender.
UCSD began its critical four-match home stand — all 
against California Collegiate Athletic Association rivals 
— by squeaking past Sonoma State 1-0. In their first home match since Sept. 13, the Tritons emerged victori-ous, thanks in part to a solid defense and a fluke play that yielded the game’s lone goal.
“We weathered the storm, ” head coach Brian 
McManus said. “We didn’t create as much as we would have liked to. Sometimes you’ve got to be able to win ugly, and tonight we won ugly. ”
UCSD outshot the Seawolves 11-9, an impressive 
show that was sullied by the fact that not one of 11 shots made it into the net. In the end, however, their inability to score did not derail the Tritons’ winning chances. 
The game’s only goal came late in the 44th minute, 
off a free kick by freshman defender Ellen Wilson. A Seawolf defender received Wilson’s kick, and — in try-ing to clear the ball out of the goal box — accidentally headed it straight into her own net.

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL —  
Coming off five-straight conference victories, the UCSD women’s volley-ball team welcomed two more games against a California Collegiate Athletic Association opponent last weekend looking to improve on its reputation as the No. 3 team in the nation. 
The Tritons continued their torrid 
run through conference play over two weekend games at RIMAC Arena, seizing two more victories over Cal State Monterey Bay and San Francisco State on Friday and Saturday nights — improving their season record to 16-1 overall, 8-1 CCAA.
Entering Friday’s game, the Tritons 
had never lost a game to Cal State Monterey Bay, holding a perfect 10-0 record against the Otters. The match began as the Otters and Tritons exchanged the lead six times early on, neither team asserting full control. 
After the Tritons called a time-
out to recover their composure, they returned with resolve and quickly storming to a 24-22 lead, using strong blocks and defensive plays to shut down the Otters’ attacks. 
At game point, the Otters quickly 
notched a service ace and a kill to tie the match up again, at 26-26. With the first game in jeopardy, UCSD slipped, giving up two points with a service error and hitting error that handed the game to the Otters.
“They have a really complicated 
offense, and it was really tough to defend against, ” head coach Tom Black said. “They could keep putting up points, and we knew we would have to adjust. ”
But the Tritons overcame their 
early service errors and played a dominant second game to reclaim the match’s momentum. Two strong kills from redshirt-freshman middle blocker Julia Freidenberg gave UCSD a quick 11-point lead at 19-8. 
The team cruised to close out the 
second game 25-10.
