DIVISION-1..................16During the past month, many 
Fall 2021 undergraduate courses 
were unexpectedly switched from 
in-person to remote formats. These 
decisions have upset some students 
who have expressed frustration 
with the last-minute changes, 
especially after they had already 
secured housing. 
The UCSD Guardian reached 
out to the Academic Senate in 
regards to the sudden changes 
of course modalities. The Senate 
responded with a quote from 
Strategic Communication and 
Engagement Manager, Kimberly 
Lamke Calderón:
“The Academic Senate is 
responsible for approving all 
courses of instruction, including 
those designed for online or remote 
learning, ” Calderón’s statement 
read. “Because of the fast moving 
nature of the COVID pandemic, 
the Academic Senate’s Educational 
Policy Committee (EPC) approved 
an exception in Spring 2021 to allow 
any undergraduate or graduate 
course to be offered remotely in Fall 
2021 without obtaining the Senate 
approvals ordinarily required. ” 
Calderón’s statement also 
explained that instructors make 
decisions about course modalities 
in collaboration with their academic 
departments and programs to best 
fit student needs. 
The Guardian also contacted 
the UC San Diego administration 
regarding the number of 
in-person and remote courses 
during Fall 2021. According to 
Assistant Director of University 
Communications Erika Johnson, 
currently 76 percent (approximately 
3,123) of courses at UCSD are 
in-person and 24 percent (992) 
courses are remote. These numbers 
are subject to change throughout 
the quarter as professors continue 
to use their discretion to change 
course modalities. 
Many students have been left 
frustrated that their classes went 
online after they struggled to secure 
housing for the quarter amidst the 
housing crisis. John Muir College 
senior Savannah Muñoz, had all 
four of her courses changed to 
remote in August after she had 
found housing in San Diego. 
“I honestly thought [courses 
would] be in person, ” Muñoz said. 
“I paid half of my booking fees for 
an Airbnb because it was really 
difficult to find an apartment near-
by UCSD that I could afford, and 
my credit score isn’t great, so I 
thought an Airbnb would be best. 
I reserved it back in June when we 
were getting emails that everything 
would be in person in the fall.
Muñoz also shared her 
experience doing remote 
coursework in the 2020–
21 academic year, but also 
acknowledged the concerns that 
professors may still have about 
teaching in-person.
“Honestly, I have ADHD and 
other issues that made remote Fall 2021 Sees

Several families hailing from the San Diego 
area remain stranded in Kabul, the capital city of 
Afghanistan. An Afghan UC San Diego student 
talked to The UCSD Guardian about their 
work with UCSD faculty and U.S. government 
officials to help free fifteen of her family 
members who are stranded in Afghanistan. 
On Aug. 15, the Afghan Islamic militant 
group known as “The Taliban” recaptured the 
capital city of Afghanistan, Kabul. The collapse 
of Afghan military resistance over the summer 
led to tens of thousands of Afghans and 
American citizens residing within the country 
attempting to flee the country within the span 
of a few weeks. 
Among these refugees were family members 
of UC San Diego student Nabila*, who shared 
the story of her family’s encounter with the 
Taliban with The Guardian. 
Nabila and her parents were born in Kabul, 
Afghanistan and immigrated to the United 
States when she was young. Her family lived 
in Afghanistan for a significant portion of 
their lives up until the recent resurgence of the 
Taliban throughout the nation. Nabila’s family 
was caught amidst the panic and fled to the 
international airport at the end of August.
“My family was going through an extremely 
traumatic experience,” Nabila said in an 
interview with The Guardian. “My family left 
their homes, possessions… everything that they 
had. ” 
Upon arrival at Hamid Karzai International 
Airport, many Afghan citizens were denied 
access to U.S. aircraft departing from the 
tarmac because they lacked passports or visas. 
As a result, some determined individuals clung 
to the sides of departing planes and eventually 
fell to their death on the tarmac.
On Aug. 27, a suicide-bomber attacked 
the Hamid Karzai International Airport. The 
attack resulted in the deaths of 90 Afghans and 
13 United States military members. Among 
the members killed was Sacramento-raised 
U.S. Marine Nicole Gee, a soldier who was 
overseeing the evacuation of the Kabul airport 
and aided citizens — including Nabila’s family 
during the evacuation.
“My heart is really bleeding for her family, ” 
Nabila wrote with regards to Gee. “I wish that 
I could meet them one day to let them know 
how brave their daughter was, and how she 
was a superhero that helped many people like 
my sister … I can’t believe that someone this 
pristine, a US Marine, led to so many people 
being saved. Her name will definitely ring out. ”
During this period, Nabila said she contacted 
hundreds of United States officials, pleading for help in her family’s extraction. Only a few 
responded to her inquiries, including but not 
limited to Bryan Lee, Armita Pedram, Rep. 
Mary Gay Scalon (D-PA 5th District), Kevin 
Mott, Catalina, and UC San Diego’s Sarah 
Clevell Storer and Uson Loressa. These are 
individuals who Nabila sincerely wants to thank 
for helping her in the process of her family’s 
evacuation.
“I didn’t eat or sleep,” Nabila stated, 
referring to the time when her family was being 
extracted from Afghanistan. “But these people 
volunteered to help my family — they were just 
helping me as a human. I can never forget what 
they have done for me. ”
Nabila’s family struggled to make it past the 
Taliban checkpoint set up at the Hamid Karzai 
International Airport. Nabila stated that the 
militant group wanted to keep as many Afghan 
citizens as possible from leaving the country.
Her cousins, sister, brother, and mother had 
visas, which made fleeing much more difficult. 
Nabila said that her mother was attacked by the 
Taliban when they discovered her citizenship 
status. 
“ As she was trying to get into the airport, she 
was trying to show her passport, ” Nabila said. 
“During the attack, they found out my mother 
was a U.S. citizen, so she got beaten by the 
Taliban. My mother’s health is still not stable 
and she is in one of the hospitals in Virginia. ”
Though the group pledged to let people 
travel freely throughout the country, the 
Taliban have been preventing citizens from 
fleeing the country throughout the duration 
of their comeback. Earlier this month, four 
chartered planes failed to leave the Kabul 
airport for varying reasons. One anonymous 
Afghan official reported that it was because 
local authorities were still deciding whether or 
not certain citizens had the correct paperwork 
to leave. 
On the tarmac itself, the militant group 
has exerted violence upon those fleeing. In 
late August, a former Afghan interpreter for 
the United States, “Jack, ” witnessed the violent 
physical assault of women in particular at the 
hands of the Taliban, shortly after the bombing 
of the Kabul Airport.
Afghan women have suffered injustice at 
the hands of the Taliban Regime. According to 
Professor Abdur Rahman I. Doi, the Professor 
and Director of the Center for Islamic Legal 
Studies at Ahmadu Bello University in Zaire, 
there is no inherent difference between men 
and women regarding their fundamental 
relationship to Allah in Islam. Both men and 
women were able to pursue eternal life and 
were cherished in their own right.

▶ REFUGE , from page 1  
However, when the Taliban 
rose to power in the late 
1990s, it adopted a much more 
narrow interpretation of their 
religion compared to the rest 
of the Islamic world. Women 
were not allowed to walk the 
streets without a burqa nor alone 
without a male blood-relative, 
and were forbidden from 
wearing clothing akin to high-
heeled shoes.
 The Taliban also denied 
women the right to pursue an 
education, and women were 
generally excluded from public 
life. The group also closed 
women’s universities and coerced 
the majority of women to drop 
their occupations. An estimated 
50,000 Afghan women had no 
source of income during the 
period.
Though the group has 
promised otherwise, recent 
statements from the Taliban 
indicate that women will fall 
under similar circumstances 
during their recent resurgence. 
A spokesman for the group, 
Zabihullah Mujahid, advised 
women to temporarily stay 
within their homes until they 
have “a new procedure” for male soldiers to follow, as many of 
them have not been trained to not 
hurt women within Afghanistan.
Nabila herself believes that 
the Taliban doesn’t follow the 
proper tenets of Islam. She noted 
that the Qur’an encourages 
women to be modest, but not 
the complete coverage of their 
bodies in garments. With this, 
Nabila believes that the Taliban’s 
narrow interpretation of the 
sacred text dehumanizes and 
reduces women to objects.
“There is a question I always 
ask, ” Nabila said. “If they are 
really following Islam, and Islam 
says that all humans are born 
to be free and be free all the 
time, do they really follow Islam 
and Qur’an? They should read 
that book. Why are they trying 
to control our moments when 
women are humans?”
The Taliban claimed that it 
was acting in the best interests of 
women through such measures 
during their initial occupation, 
citing that women could be 
“happy” within the bounds of 
Sharia law while maintaining 
modern civil liberties. 
The higher education minister 
of Afghanistan, Abdul Baqi 
Haqqani, laid out new policies permitting female education at 
gender-segregated universities 
on Sept. 12. The minister claimed 
that the Taliban didn’t want to 
“turn back the clock 20 years. ” 
However, the initiative used to 
evaluate subjects being taught 
in female universities is based 
in Sharia law and local cultural 
tradition, similar to the harsh 
fundamentalist rule imposed in 
the late 20th century. 
Nabila has proudly fought 
back against that initiative by not 
only attending UCSD but also by 
founding a fundraising campaign 
on GoFundMe to buy Afghan 
women and children food and 
other emergency necessities 
while living in uncertainty.
Additionally, the Afghan 
Student Association at UCSD is 
offering immediate assistance 
to afflicted scholars through 
a crowd-sourced fundraiser. 
The fundraiser is called the 
“ Afghanistan Scholars at Risk 
Postdoctoral Fellowship Fund” 
and it seeks to aid Afghan 
academics at-risk in light of the 
Taliban-takeover that occurred 
last month. 
Displaced scholars hailing 
from Afghanistan are encouraged 
to come to UCSD for temporary 
academic shelter on campus. 
Scholars are also permitted to 
continue their research through 
this fund.
The Afghan Student 
Association says this is “a way 
to preserve the future of higher 
education in Afghanistan, 
which might otherwise suffer 
significant setbacks from the 
persecution, imprisonment and 
deaths of such individuals. ” 
For inquiries regarding the 
ASA fundraiser, they should 
contact Tom Smith Tseng, 
senior executive director of 
development of international 
and campus initiatives. He can 
be reached at tomtseng@ucsd.
edu or (858) 822-3955.
Editor’s Note: Nabila wishes 
to withhold her last name to 
maintain a degree of anonymity 
for the safety of her family.classes extremely difficult for me 
the past year, ” Muñoz added. “I’ve 
finally got the hang of it and a ton 
of support, so I think I’ll be okay, 
but I really was looking forward to 
being in person. But I understand 
that some professors don’t feel 
comfortable, so I totally respect 
that. ” 
Meanwhile, professors now 
have the responsibility to decide 
the safest option for themselves 
and their students. Gary Fields, a 
professor in the communication 
department, shared in an email 
with The Guardian about why he 
chose to go remote for his class.
“Let me first say, emphatically, 
that teaching in-person is far 
preferable for everyone — faculty 
and students alike, ” Fields said. 
“When I finished my teaching in 
the Spring term, I thought it would 
be the last time I would ever teach 
online. I love the dynamism of a 
classroom. I waited until the very 
last moment to form an opinion 
about online teaching for our 
course. My concern, of course, was 
the health and safety not just for 
me, but for the students. ”
Professor Fields also added that 
he chose to wait as long as possible 
to switch the course to a remote 
format for the safety of students: 
“I know that the university has 
implemented very strict conditions 
on all campus activity, ” Fields said. 
“ At the same time, when I really 
thought about the prospect of 35 
students in an enclosed room — 
even with all of the vaccination and 
masking protocols, I did not feel 
comfortable with the idea that my 
class could conceivably result in 
someone becoming infected with 
COVID. ”
For Fall 2021, UCSD 
implemented numerous COVID-
19 policies to conduct in-person 
classes. Fully vaccinated students 
living on-campus are required to 
test weekly for the first four weeks 
of fall quarter. On-campus students 
who are not fully vaccinated 
are required to do twice-weekly 
testing. This is in addition to the 
university’s vaccine mandate, 
which requires proof of vaccination 
for all students, staff, and faculty. ▶ FALL ‘21 , from page 1For the start of Fall 2021, all 
students, faculty, and staff must 
be fully vaccinated against the 
COVID-19 virus, or have an 
approved exception or deferral 
to comply with the University 
of California’s vaccine mandate. 
Students who fail to request an 
exemption or receive their 
vaccination by Sept. 6 will not be 
allowed on campus or permitted to 
participate in university programs. 
Consequences of non-participation 
include dismissal from educational 
programs. 
The UC system accepts all seven 
vaccines approved by the World 
Health Organization (WHO). 
International students who are unable to receive the vaccine in their 
home country or have received a 
vaccine not approved by the WHO 
must submit an “International 
Students Unable to Access V accine” 
request by Sept. 2. They will be 
granted eight weeks upon arrival to 
receive their vaccine.
At UC San Diego, the vaccine 
mandate is part of a multi-pronged 
approach to curb the spread of 
COVID-19. In conjunction with 
the vaccine mandate, measures 
in the Return to Learn program 
include exposure and contact 
tracing, symptom screening, 
regular COVID-19 testing, and 
a mask policy. Depending on an 
individual’s vaccination status, the 
required measures vary. 
V accinated students who have 
come into close contact with a COVID-19 case will be required 
to quarantine for seven days and 
conduct a COVID-19 test three to 
five days after exposure. V accinated 
students are still allowed to enter 
campus and attend class, but must 
wear a mask indoors, in residential 
common areas, and in crowded 
outdoor settings. 
Similar to vaccinated students, 
unvaccinated students who are 
exposed to COVID-19 must 
quarantine and take a COVID-19 
test. However, they are not allowed 
to enter campus or attend class. 
Unvaccinated students living on 
campus will also be relocated to 
quarantine housing. Those living off-
campus have the option to move into 
quarantine housing.
Some UCSD students expressed 
their support of the mandate and its benefits. In an interview with The 
UCSD Guardian, Roger Revelle 
College junior Rushil Pithia told 
The Guardian, “I think both the 
vaccine mandate and the mask 
policies are crucial in prioritizing 
the health of students. ” 
Y et, despite the comprehensive 
Return to Learn policies aimed at 
curbing the spread of the disease, 
some students have already found 
that their classes have moved 
online abruptly. Given that students 
anticipate in-person lessons, such 
changes may be disappointing. 
For students like Pithia, 
in-person education is invaluable, 
as it provides “the ability to be more 
hands-on and interactive with the 
content. ” 
While vaccine mandates are the 
subject of major public debate, the 
requirement appears to be bearing 
fruit. San Diego State University, 
which had started its semester 
in August, yielded a .58 percent 
positivity rate. Since Aug. 20, the 
university has had 175 student 
COVID-19 cases amongst a 
33,000-strong student population 
and a .47 percent positivity rate. 
This pales in comparison 
to public universities in other 
states. Florida State University 
has recorded 2869 COVID-19 
cases since August and has a 3.48 
percent positivity rate. As of Sept. 
17, none of Florida’s 12 public 
universities enforces a vaccine 
mandate, and only the University 
of Miami requires its employees to 
be vaccinated. 
As the local COVID-19 situation 
continues to change rapidly, the 
Return to Learn program not 
only remains abreast with new 
developments, but also anticipates 
worrying trends by studying 
various factors.
Dr. Robert Schooley, one of the 
professors heading the Return to 
Learn program, told The Guardian UCSD’s New Vaccine and Testing Policies for Fall 
Quarter begin Delivery FormatNEW S  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , SEPTEMBER 27, 2021| WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  3
in an interview that the Return 
to Learn program “monitor(s) 
multiple data streams every day 
to ascertain whether there are any 
concerning signals of an increasing 
incidence of SARS CoV-2 
infection. ” 
In addition to comprehensive 
contact tracing, these data 
streams include the number 
and distribution of COVID-19 
positive wastewater signals, the 
local COVID-19 incidence rate, 
the general infection demographic 
in San Diego, the hospitalization 
rate, student behavior, and police 
reports. 
For instance, wastewater signals 
might lead the Return to Learn 
program to begin testing people 
possibly contributing to the waste 
stream. Similarly, contact tracing 
helps identify locations or events 
that are responsible for infection 
clusters. 
Schooley added that the data 
gathered from the Return to Learn 
Program is analyzed to find trends 
that can inform preemptive changes 
to public health policy. 
“  We look for trends in key 
parameters to make decisions 
proactively before thresholds are 
reached, ” Schooley explained. 
“Threshold-based decision-making 
has been one of the biggest failures 
of public health policy-making. ” 
After monitoring the rates of 
these factors, UCSD administrators 
decide if COVID-19 measures 
should be relaxed or tightened. 
For more information about 
how to stay safe during the COVID-
19 pandemic, students can visit the 
Return to Learn website to learn 
more about the vaccine mandate, 
exposure and contact tracing, and 
COVID-19 testing and screening.BY  A b by  L e e

 Global Repercussions 
          of  Eurocentrism 
BY  R a y m o n d  T r a n
Opinion editor
During the early stages of the 
pandemic, the Western world 
was frightened of Covid-19, but 
for the wrong reasons, exoticizing 
the pandemic and placing blame 
onto countries for practices that 
are normal for them. The virus was 
immediately painted in cultural 
terms, framed in an antagonizing 
narrative of a threat “coming from 
afar. ” 
This type of thinking is a result 
of Eurocentrism, the practice of 
interpreting the world in terms 
of European or Anglo-American 
values and experiences which 
suggests an otherwise imbalanced 
representation and view of cultures. 
Eurocentrism has infected the 
Western understanding of the 
world and seemingly altered the 
reality we live in. From education 
to politics to science, our narrow 
understanding of how the world 
operates leaves us blind and 
ignorant to life outside the Western 
world. 
Researchers deduct that this 
issue was a result of “European 
colonialism and global domination 
by Western powers. ” Arun 
Kumar Pokhrel, a specialist 
in contemporary British and 
global Anglophone literature 
and postcolonial environmental 
theory, published a paper in 2011 
explaining how “the process of 
Europeanization intensified once 
Europe became capitalistic and 
developed the power to conquer 
the other parts of the world. ”
Our country’s reaction to the 
Covid-19 pandemic became the 
epitome of Eurocentrism. As racist incidents against Asians began 
increasing, China’s responsibility 
was called into question, referring 
to the country’s sanitary conditions 
and culinary traditions.
The pandemic was most 
alarming for its disturbing 
intrusion into the intimate life of 
the Westerner. 
The paradigm of Western 
exceptionalism was called into 
question. Citizens of the West, 
particularly America, questioned 
the responses that had been 
adopted earlier and elsewhere, 
mask-wearing in Asia, for 
instance, as too intrusive for their 
“democratic” lifestyles. While it was 
very typical to wear a mask in 
Asian countries even before the 
pandemic, Americans challenged 
new Covid-19 guidelines in the 
name of American freedom.
Additionally, Harvard Law 
published an article expressing the 
differences in medical philosophy 
between Europe and the Global 
South and how those differences 
lead to a Eurocentric international 
response to the pandemic. 
In concentrating on Western 
conceptions of health, ideas that 
are focused on individual life 
expectancy and the prevention 
of diseases, there was insufficient 
response paid to realities in the 
Global South.
Essentially, the Western 
conceptualization of health within 
the World Health Organization 
ignored the factors that non-
Western countries take into 
consideration when addressing 
health and safety issues such as “environmental contamination 
and degradation; physical and 
economic determinants of health 
care access; inequality in health care 
access; physical and psychological 
harm; poverty; availability of 
potable water, foodstuffs, crops, 
and livestock during armed 
conflict; and lack of drinking water, 
electricity, and medicines. ”
In education, Eurocentrism 
has essentially rewritten history, 
painting European culture and 
its descendants as the main 
characters, when in reality the 
world is much more nuanced 
than that. For example, in 2015, 
McGraw Hill was called out for 
publishing a geography textbook 
with misleading information about 
immigration and slavery. 
The specific page that was 
called into question only had an 
introductory summary and three 
text bubbles. Issues arose with one 
bubble in particular. 
Pointing to a patch of purple 
grids extending throughout the 
country’s Southeast corridor, the 
one-sentence caption reads: “The 
Atlantic Slave Trade between the 
1500s and 1800s brought millions 
of workers from Africa to the 
southern United States to work on 
agricultural plantations. ”
Roni Dean-Burren, a mother of 
one of the students who possessed 
one of these textbooks, took to 
social media, posting a video that 
has been viewed nearly two million 
times. 
“It talked about the U.S.A. being 
a country of immigration, but 
mentioning the slave trade in terms 
Art by Nicholas Regli 4  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , SEPTEMBER 27, 2021 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  OPINON
of immigration was just off, ” she 
told The New Y ork Times. “It’s that 
nuance of language. This is what 
erasure looks like. ” 
The reality of the stories is 
distorted to fit a Eurocentric 
point of view. But the retelling 
of these narratives creates a false 
reality, minimizing the struggles 
and prejudices people from other 
countries faced in the past, as 
well as the issues that plague our 
modern world. 
There is a saying that goes: 
“History is always written by the 
winners. ” But, now, it is finally time 
for the whole story to be written. 
Closer to home, the five-course 
Humanities writing sequence at 
Roger Revelle College only covers 
European history and its authors. 
Focusing on Catholicism and 
European authors. While these 
writers and experiences are still 
important, “Humanities” should 
encompass a wider range of themes 
and authors, not just the European. 
The Revelle website states 
that in the Humanities sequence, 
“Students examine the development 
of a wide variety of ideas and forms 
of expression that exert a major 
influence on modern America. ” 
However, is there truly a “wide 
variety of ideas” that “influence 
modern America” if those ideas are 
only focused on Europe? 
The world thinks the European 
and Anglo-American way of life is 
the only “right” way. 
We need to acknowledge 
that our history books and 
preconceived notions are formed 
from a Eurocentric perspective. Then, make sure the voices and 
stories of the silenced part of the 
world are heard, especially in 
European and Anglo-American 
dominated regions. Introducing 
authors of color and dismantling 
the Eurocentric curriculum are 
key in challenging the systematic 
Eurocentric behaviors we are 
taught. 
For Americans, Eurocentrism 
is deeply rooted in our systems 
and behaviors, and the only way to 
grasp a more open-minded, diverse, 
and worldly understanding of the 
cultures and people around us is 
to challenge the way information 
is presented and dismantle the 
notions made before us. Art by Nicholas RegliOPINION  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , SEPTEMBER 27, 2021| WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  5
But education failed to prevent 
the act. Bigotry took the reins. And 
quite literally...lashed out. 
With a crumbling government 
and devastating earthquakes first 
in 2010 and now in 2021, many 
Haitians have taken and continue 
to cross a treacherous path through 
Latin America to seek a better 
future in the U.S. But this past week 
we witnessed these Haitian asylum 
seekers being ruthlessly whipped 
by patrols on horseback. The power 
of mass communication ensured 
that the Biden administration was 
quickly put to task on addressing 
this atrocity. Our immigration 
and justice systems should have 
never allowed these crimes to be 
committed against human beings 
in the first place. But predicating 
involvement by these systems, 
proper diversity training and education should have better 
informed officials whose main 
job was interacting with those of 
different backgrounds than their 
own. Destitution and race should 
not have left Haitian migrants at 
the mercy of criminals exercising 
inhumane treatment. 
Improvement in education 
will look different for all. Some 
mentors will have to work to prove 
to their students the very existence 
of systemic racism. 
Others who have acknowledged 
this fact must be educated on 
more nuanced biases and beliefs 
that often lead to complacency on 
urging massive changes in favor 
of human rights. This includes 
being taught to stop separating the 
recorded world from their own. 
The recording of George Floyd was 
not merely a movie of a distant past. It was the reality of the 21st century. 
The tape of the plight of Haitian 
migrants was not from a distant 
land. It was at our very nation’s 
border. While we realize that these 
events are tragic, and even engage 
in activism to stop future incidents, 
a phenomenon known as psychic 
numbing does not allow us to care 
for people without knowing their 
individual stories. Regardless of 
how many pictures are shared or 
how many people are traumatized, 
only detailed and individualistic 
encounters resonate with us. 
These stories help us connect with 
individuals so we can then lead 
with compassion in listening to the 
oppressed masses.
The knowledge of border camps, 
maltreatment of Afghan refugees, 
and the notorious history of lashes 
could have been instrumental in preventing the use of whips by 
patrol agents from the beginning. 
Many children were separated from 
the very parents that were trying 
to give them a better future. Many 
asylum-seekers were given meals 
that could barely qualify as a snack. 
When they asked for more, their 
experiences mirrored a horrible, 
real-life manifestation of the 
situations faced by Charles Dickens’ 
famously destitute fictional 
character, Oliver Twist. Prejudice 
mixed with weaponry is lethal and 
cruel. Whips have long been used 
to subject people deemed less than 
because of intrinsic characteristics. 
Regardless of their justification 
and employment on horses, the 
past clearly lays out the potential 
of whips to seriously maim people 
and subject them to treatment 
warranted by no animal, let alone 
any human.  
Providing context for the pain 
of these refugees, and on the 
struggles of BIPOC communities 
could have stopped the patrol 
agents themselves in their tracks. 
They need to actively engage 
with activists who are deeply 
connected to and willing to talk 
about standing with survivors of 
tragedy. Beyond approving the 
use of whips comes the actions of 
those wielding them. Patrol officers 
should be tested on knowledge 
about the background of the 
migrants they will be working with 
most: stories on why moving three 
or four times between countries 
while holding no documentation is 
the best option for refugees, what 
forms of instability are plaguing 
their communities and countries, 
and who their families are. This is 
not to lay out trauma, but rather to 
provide agents with much needed 
information to civilly and justly 
process the people they encounter 
on the border.
Rather than superficially 
placing border officers above the law through practices like qualified 
immunity, we must work to ensure 
that migrants are not disregarded 
or disserviced by the law. We 
cannot criminalize seeking refuge 
in a country that is not yet their 
own when their country of origin 
cannot protect them. 
The immigration and other 
racializing systems must endeavor 
to consider the experiences of the 
oppressed minority, when they are 
willing, in training officers and 
agents. Regulation is important, 
but laws are meant to preserve 
our well-being, not attack it. 
These officers deserve dismissal at 
best. The system, at a minimum, 
must include diversity-centric 
training and compassion-valuing 
employment.
Why in America circa 2021 
can we expect ebony and umber-
stained red? Why is ivory not 
assumed to meet the same end? 
Both instances are unforgivable, yet 
only one is unimaginable.
The northern border would 
seldom expect such behavior 
towards migrants. There is obvious 
reasoning behind why. Attacking 
fawn is taught as unduly wrong, 
white deserves nothing but light. 
Attacking black and brown is 
taught as simply protecting oneself 
as law enforcement supposedly 
fends off criminals in the dark. 
Education is the way forward 
towards combating acts like 
those displayed by the border 
patrol. Connections strengthened 
by understanding can end these 
racist acts. Shedding light on 
the circumstances surrounding 
migrants’ escape is crucial in 
enforcing law with empathy.   We Reacted to the Scenes

In light of the slight uptick in 
law school enrollment, the legal 
profession is currently growing 
at a rate of 9% throughout the 
next decade, compared to other 
careers requiring a professional 
or doctorate degree within 
the STEM field. Additionally, 
cumulative enrollment in law 
schools has fallen into another 
natural recession over the course 
of the previous decade, according 
to data from the National Bureau 
of Economic Research.
This posits an abundance 
of opportunity for pre-law 
undergraduate students. More 
law schools will hunt for more 
prospective students to uphold 
their medians and income 
through tuition, opening the 
doors for academically successful 
students that have drastically 
higher grade-point averages than 
that of the average college student 
in the United States. Secondly, 
more highly ranked schools could 
offer more students a potential 
scholarship due to the fact that 
overall JD enrollment was down 
23.5% as soon as two years ago.
Even in light of the new found 
benefits of going down the prelaw path, the decision to pursue a 
Juris Doctorate or L.L.M. degree 
remains a decision with a myriad 
of factors to weigh. 
One of the reasons for the sharp 
decrease in law school enrollment 
is based on the pressure law 
schools faced to disclose honest 
employment numbers.
Organizations like “Law School 
Transparency, ” provide evidence 
which can disway people looking 
for sky high salaries from the get 
go. On top of the salary roadblock 
for some, there are multiple routes 
and career paths for law students 
to choose from. All of the routes 
require students to eventually key 
in on a path.  
According to a 2018–19 
Student Profile from the Office of 
Institutional Research Academic 
Affairs, UC San Diego’s student 
body is primarily composed of 
Social Science students with 
Biology and other STEM 
programs ranking among the most 
popular degrees. Thus, while most 
UCSD students are likely most 
oriented towards medical school, 
there is also a significant section 
of students looking forward to a 
legal career. 
In anticipation of the 
fall application cycle for law 
school winding up, The UCSD 
Guardian reached out to current law students, professors, and 
undergraduate pupils for their 
take on what makes a successful 
law school application. 
One of the first requirements 
to apply to law school is an 
undergraduate degree.  Ultimately, 
the major is up to the student’s 
choice since grade-point 
average (GPA) and Law School 
Aptitude Test (LSAT) score are 
the core deciding factors on your 
application.
Some popular undergraduate 
majors for law school include 
Criminology, Economics, 
Business, Philosophy, English, and 
Political Science. These degrees 
prevail due in large part to the 
emphasis put on research, critical 
thinking, and exposure to the legal 
field. 
Note that law schools by and 
large are indifferent to major 
choice due to a few reasons. 
Firstly, no two law schools are 
the same, meaning that there 
is a considerable difference in 
academic vigor versus legal 
clinical experience. Secondly, as 
will be discussed more in-depth in 
the next section, law schools care 
deeply about raising their median 
statistics. It is wise to pick a major 
that you will thrive in so that you 
will rise above the median GPA of 
your target school.After graduating with a degree 
in “X, Y , or Z” with a minor in “ A, 
B, or C, ” the statistical side of law 
school admissions remains: GPA 
and LSAT score alone can make or 
break the chances of getting into 
law school. 
Joseph Berck, a third-year 
History major from Warren 
College and current law school 
applicant, emphasized the 
importance of undergraduate 
GPA.
“ A common misconception 
undergrads hold is the idea that 
admissions officers are going to 
look more favorably on harder 
classes… you might get a slight 
boost, but this really isn’t true, ” 
Berck told The Guardian. “If 
you’re a hard STEM major, the 
slight boost you’re going to get, 
unless you are way better at STEM 
than you are humanities or social 
sciences, is going to be completely 
outweighed by how much harder 
STEM is and also by how much 
lower grades that STEM professors 
expect to give out. ”
Berck recommends that 
prospective law school applicants 
prioritize raising their GPA 
by taking classes that suit 
their interests and majors and 
compliment their abilities. 
Additionally, Spivey Consulting Group, a group focused on 
maximizing student outcomes in 
law school applications, outline 
two reasons as to why law schools 
have a vested interest in raising 
their GPA and LSAT medians. 
Firstly, a student’s LSAT score 
is a useful predictor of first-year 
performance. The test is essentially 
a series of logic games and long-
winded reading passages designed 
to identify a student’s ability to 
discern through various premises 
and spot issues in a diverse array 
of situations. 
The schools believe if a student 
can accurately deconstruct 
convoluted paragraphs and 
conceptualize logic games, the 
student could do well in school. 
The second reason is that better 
medians help the school’s U.S. 
News ranking, which leads to 
more applications and thus more 
revenue for the schools.
Professor Steve Zipperstein, a 
senior fellow at the UCLA Center 
for Middle East Development 
and visiting professor at Tel Aviv 
University Law School in Israel 
spoke to this point.
“The LSAT is obviously very 
important, which means students 
should enroll or sign up for a 
prep course, ” Zipperstein told The     Applying to Law School: 
  What UCSD  Alumni, Students, 
    and Faculty Have to Say
BY  J o z e  C h a v e z
Senior staff writerArt by Ava BayleyFEATURES  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , SEPTEMBER 27, 2021| WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  7
Guardian. “It’s very important to 
walk into the LSAT well rested. 
If you’re not ready by Thursday, 
you’re not going to be ready. No 
matter how much cramming you 
do Thursday night and Friday 
night. ”
Proficiency in logic and 
punctuality will also help in one’s 
academics as well, considering 
the weight put on your first-year 
grades for summer internship and 
job opportunities, according to 
Zipperstein. 
He says that the only way to 
get good grades in your first year 
of law school is to “roll up your 
sleeves. ” He recommends avoiding 
cramming right before exams 
and instead achieving a level of 
consistency from the first day of 
law school until final exams 
“If you commit yourself to 
a consistent, day by day, days, 
nights, weekends, if you commit 
yourself to a consistent schedule 
of studying, you will do very very 
well on your first set of exams 
after the fall semester, ” Zipperstein 
stated to The Guardian. “Then you 
will do very well on your second 
set of exams after the spring 
semester, and that will position 
you beautifully for employment 
for that crucial summer between 
second and third year. ”
The next step is to focus on 
the more nuanced “soft sections” 
on the law school application: 
the personal statement, diversity 
statement, resumé, letters of 
recommendation, and other 
optional essays.
These elements are integral to 
any law school application, but 
are of particular importance to 
“splitters” applying to law school. 
Splitters are students that have 
extremely skewed statistics -— a high GPA and low LSAT or vice 
versa. If students are splitters or 
have lower statistics overall, law 
schools are going to have to weigh 
other aspects of their application 
that are much “softer. ”
The personal statement is 
essentially a short essay where 
students describe who they are 
and why they would like to attend 
law school. 
Justin Fang, a rising fourth-
year Business Psychology student 
at W arren College recommends 
that students focus on two factors 
when crafting their personal 
statements: why they are pursuing 
law and how they are excellent in 
some facet of their lives. 
“  Now it really helps if you have 
some kind of concrete story or 
instance that you can share that 
really helped you garner interest 
in law, ” Fang told The Guardian. 
“That would be really helpful in 
helping the officers understand 
how meaningful law is as a career 
to you. ”
Fang used Democratic 
Representative Cory Booker’s 
personal statement as an example 
of a successful personal statement. 
He addresses how his parents, as 
people of color, went to visit a 
house and the real estate agent 
didn’t want to show it to his parents 
because they were people of color. 
By contrast, white individuals 
were able to tour the open house 
freely. 
This anecdote was something 
that Cory Booker said made 
him really interested in law and 
thus strengthened his law school 
personal statement.
In addition to the personal 
statement, there are a myriad of 
other essays some schools may 
recommend applicants file. Among these essays is the optional 
diversity statement, which 
is typically a 250-word essay 
discussing your ethnic, racial, or 
intellectual background and its 
relation to law.
Arya Sadigian, a 3L a California 
Western School of Law emphasizes 
the importance of diversity in the 
legal field and how important the 
statement is when it comes to law 
school.
“It doesn’t necessarily have 
to mean that you’re part of a 
minority group, obviously, ” 
Sadigian noted to The Guardian. 
“That is a big part of diversity and 
that’s something that is very young 
in the legal community because as 
lawyers get into the legal field they 
see the law is all around us. ”
With regards to obtaining 
letters of recommendation, 
contacting three professors you 
may feel close to at least a month 
before you plan on submitting 
your application is a wise move. All 
in all, the “soft sections” of the law 
school application depend on how 
well factors like undergraduate 
grades and standing already are. 
Some students fulfill all of the 
basic requirements for their law 
school application and set their 
sights on the top law schools in 
the country, which are colloquially 
known as the “Top 14. ” While 
lawyers often get paid significantly 
higher than the median salary 
for an individual in the United 
States, they still accumulate a 
significant amount of debt from 
the beginning of their legal career.
The average amount of debt 
incurred by a law student is 
$160,000, which is no small feat 
to pay off in addition to interest. 
Despite the astronomical cost of 
law school, many students will opt 
to apply to the best of the best just for the sake of name recognition 
or a hyper-specialized opportunity 
said school exclusively offers.
Glenn C. Smith, Professor of 
Law at California Western School 
of Law and Visiting Professor of 
Political Science at UC San Diego, 
told The Guardian that students 
ought to aim to individualize their 
professional education as opposed 
to seeking prestige.
“Many students at UCSD 
think of applying to law school 
as a one-size-fits all, ” Smith said. 
“People miss the important point 
that it should be an individualized 
assessment about what’s going to 
really serve their mental academic, 
professional needs. ”
Law school is vastly different 
from undergraduate education in 
more ways than one, especially on 
the basis of cost. 
While many of the top schools 
charge upwards of $160,000, some 
schools offer merit or full-ride 
scholarships based on academic 
standing. A few schools that offer 
such awards are University of 
Chicago Law School, UCLA Law 
School, University of Virginia Law 
School, and more.
Kenneth J. Vandevelde, the 
former Dean of Thomas Jefferson 
Law School and current Lecturer 
at UCSD found that he excelled 
in applying to law school and by 
emphasizing involvement where 
it counted.
“I didn’t belong to lots of 
things, but whatever I did belong 
to I pretty much was in charge of 
it, ” V andevelde said. “I picked a 
few things and I really excelled at 
those things and I think that was 
the thing that made me stand out 
a little bit. ”
Back in his undergraduate years, 
Professor V andevelde was elected 
head of his student government in college, was a veteran of the 
student newspaper, and eventually 
ranked his way up to the president 
of the statewide association of 
student governments. This is not 
to say that one has to check off 
these boxes, but rather to show 
that there is no “cookie cutter” 
approach to the process.
With so many factors of 
student’s control, the best students 
can do is put themselves in the 
best position they can get to. The 
admissions board holds their fate 
from there.Tease description

Summer ‘21 Top Hits 
B y  A&E STAFF WRITERs
As fall quarter once again looms 
menacingly over the horizon, our 
writers at A&E reflect back on the 
content that helped them usher in 
the new post-vaccine summer. Check 
out the stories, movies, and albums 
that comforted us through all of the 
uncertainty and accompanied us as 
we stepped out into the world once 
again.
 
“CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST”  
- Tyler, the Creator 
After a year of being locked up, 
many of us were beginning to feel a 
little stir-crazy. Our homes quickly 
went from being a safe haven from 
the dangers of the pandemic to a 
space full of chaos and stress as 
work and leisure messily blended 
into a single space, denying us 
the luxuries of complete focus or 
relaxation. When vaccines finally 
became widely available, there was 
a glimmer of hope, a light at the 
end of the tunnel. We put on our best outfits and stepped out, our 
excitement bolstered by the mRNA 
pumping through our systems. 
Finally, freedom. Nothing could’ve 
embodied this time’s newfound 
freedom and reprieve better than 
Tyler, the Creator’s sixth studio 
album “CALL ME IF YOU GET 
LOST . ” Brimming with horns and 
hopping from smooth jazz-rap 
tracks to gritty, blow-your-speakers-
out bangers, this new record from 
the internet’s favorite provocateur 
was the perfect soundtrack for a 
post-quarantine summer. Name 
dropping exotic travel destinations 
like Geneva and Capri, Tyler 
boasts of his vacationesque 
lifestyle, flexing his luxurious car 
collection, while also weaving in 
a scandalous narrative about his 
adventures in homewrecking. With 
ad-libs from the legendary DJ 
Drama, this project truly feels like 
the convergence of the early and 
mid-2000s hip-hop that inspired 
Tyler and the present-day sounds inspiring the next generation. 
Features from hip-hop veterans 
like Lil Wayne and Pharrell as 
well as younger stars of the genre 
like Y oungboy Never Broke Again 
and 42 Dugg further add to the 
project’s unique mixture of new 
and old. Standout tracks include 
the ‘90s-inspired “WUSY ANAME, ” 
the sly diss track “RISE, ” and my 
personal favorite: “SWEET / I 
THOUGHT YOU W ANTED TO 
DANCE, ” whose latter half invokes 
images of an unrequited romance 
set in a Wes Anderson film. This 
project’s throughline message of 
freedom, of all kinds, made it the 
perfect travel companion as we 
stepped back out into the world, 
ready to rediscover the joys of 
summer picnics and leisurely beach 
days.

“Demon Slayer: Kimestu no 
Y aiba the Movie: Mugen Train” 
While “Demon Slayer: Kimestu 
no Yaiba the Movie: Mugen Train” 
was released in the U.S. in April of 
this year, it was the first movie I 
watched in theater since the start 
of the pandemic, making it my 
summer hit. During the pandemic, 
I began to watch more anime and 
I was awestruck by the “Demon 
Slayer” series during my first 
watch-through. I really enjoyed 
most of the characters and their 
design, but most importantly the 
animation style, and I feel like all 
these elements that made the series 
great were present in the film.
First, the characters. In the 
series, I found Zenitsu unbearable. 
I disliked how annoying he could 
get, being not only the loudest 
character, but also the most 
cowardly. However, the more 
I watched the film, the more I 
weirdly enjoyed him. Although he was still wimpy at times, it felt a 
lot more toned-down than before, 
and I would be lying if I said the 
train scene where he saves Nezuko 
wasn’t one of the coolest scenes in 
the movie, demonstrating just how 
powerful he could be. In addition 
to Zenitsu, I really enjoyed the 
main villain Enmu, especially how 
he used his power to manipulate 
the dreams of his victims. Part 
of what makes Enmu’s ability so 
interesting is that the only way for a 
character to break out of the ability 
is to commit suicide in the dream. 
This caveat leads characters to 
eventually forget what world they 
are in and almost kill themselves 
in the real world as they repeatedly 
commit suicide in order to stay in 
battle againt Enmu, providing for 
high-intensity action scenes.
“Demon Slayer” as a whole does 
an amazing job in combining CGI 
and regular animation. It’s done so 
well that it simply feels natural and 
it’s amazing to look at. However, 
Images courtesy of Call Me If You Get Lost
Images courtesy of Planet Headline A&E  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , SEPTEMBER 27, 2021 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  9
there were some points in the movie 
where the CGI didn’t feel the same 
as the rest of the movie or even the 
series. Enmu’s abilities allow him to 
cover the train, the main setting of 
the movie, with tentacle-like arms, 
which were animated with CGI. 
The CGI for the arms felt really 
out of place at times; during my 
first watch-through in theaters, I 
remember thinking that the arms 
look like they were modeled using 
PlayStation 3 graphics from the 
late 2000s. Despite the weird CGI 
for Enmu’s ability, the rest of the 
animation in the film was jaw-
dropping, especially the scenes 
where characters like Tanjiro, 
Zenitsu, and Rengoku have their 
breathing techniques — water, 
thunder, and flame, respectively 
— represented visually by having 
the element present throughout 
the slashing motion of their sword. 
Simply put, it’s art.  
As a whole, the “Demon Slayer” 
movie was one of the highlights 
of my summer, and I was glad it 
was the first movie I saw back in 
theaters.

 “The Green Knight” 
Despite the banality of this 
year’s summer blockbusters (see 
“Space Jam: A New Legacy, ” “F9, ” 
and “The Kissing Booth 3”), indie 
powerhouse A24’s newest fantasy 
film “The Green Knight, ” presents 
a refreshing rendering of a classic 
Arthurian tale. Based on the Middle 
English poem “Sir Gawain and 
the Green Knight” (translated by 
J.R.R. Tolkien), the film follows an 
unsure and reckless Gawain (Dev 
Patel) along his quest to confront 
the eponymous Green Knight — 
a gigantic tree-like creature who, 
after an unexpected holiday visit 
to King Arthur’s court, engages 
Gawain in a deathly exchange 
of blows. Despite the uncanny 
resemblance between Tolkien’s 
Ent tree spirits and director David 
Lowery’s Green Knight, the two 
epic, fantasy-inspired films hold 
little in common. “The Green 
Knight’’ is not a fitting alternative 
to the grandeur and eventfulness of 
Tolkien’s beloved trilogy, nor is it a 
universally-accepted interpretation 
of the original source text. 
Instead, Lowery, alongside a cast 
of charming Hollywood regulars 
(Alicia Vikander, Barry Keoghan), crafts an equally meditative and 
confounding film about Gawain’s 
coming of age. Much like the 
English landscape that the film 
depicts, the moral of Gawain’s tale 
in “The Green Knight’’ is foggy. 
Is Lowery mocking medieval 
England’s fascination with duty and 
obligation? Or is he reaffirming 
the relevance of chivalric values in 
the modern age? These questions, 
among a myriad of others 
surrounding the film’s ambiguous 
ending, are not easily answered. 
And while the film’s elusiveness 
strays from the inane box office 
formula, its baffling nature lends 
itself well to the myth surrounding 
Gawain, his infamous uncle King 
Arthur, and Gawain’s mystic quest 
for redemption.

“My Friend Cassidy Has a New 
Boyfriend”
As our reality shifts closer to 
the much memed-about “darkest 
timeline, ” it’s comforting to 
consume media that’s somehow 
more absurd than our day-to-day 
lives. Enter Caroline Schaper’s 
bizarre, delightfully off-kilter short story, “My Friend Cassidy Has A 
New Boyfriend.” Published in the 
Columbia Journal this August, the 
piece follows a neurotic woman as 
she wrangles with feelings of jealousy, 
admiration, and confusion upon 
meeting her friend’s famous new 
beau. The boyfriend in question is the 
Pink Panther, the 1960s-era cartoon 
character associated with the film 
franchise of the same name starring 
famed British actor Peter Sellers. 
The obvious question is, how does a 
cartoon character appear in the real 
world, let alone date a presumably 
human woman? Schaper doesn’t 
answer, instead using the main 
character’s immediate acceptance of 
the situation as a way to convince 
the reader into accepting it, too. 
As the story progresses, the main 
character’s thoughts about the Pink 
Panther spiral into comical levels 
of irrationality, culminating in a 
satisfying moment when she reaches 
her breaking point. 
The story’s premise is admittedly 
ridiculous, but the authority and 
detail with which Schaper tells the 
tale prevent it from coming off as 
gimmicky or superficial. Schaper, 
who has written for late-night 
mainstays like “Full Frontal with 
Samantha Bee” and “The Late Show 
with David Letterman” , effortlessly walks the line between comedy and 
pathos. The humor of the story is 
grounded in relatable anxiety about 
meeting a friend’s SO and navigating 
the changed dynamic they create 
within the overall friend group. By 
exaggerating Cassidy’s new boyfriend 
to the extreme, Schaper is able to 
similarly exaggerate the mixed 
emotions that arise when Cassidy’s 
friends meet him. 
Behind the expected niceties and 
supportive comments are feelings of 
jealousy, judgment, and insecurity. 
As is the case with many great jokes, 
the main character’s reaction is funny 
because it’s recognizable. The scenario 
might be fictional, but the emotions 
ring true. This nuance, combined 
with the story’s stellar humor, makes 
“My Friend Cassidy Has A New 
Boyfriend” a comedic gem. Read it 
and enter a lighter timeline — at least, 
for a little while.

10 tips for college freshman
     
1) Know your way 
around campus
Becoming acquainted with the 
campus you live, work, and attend 
classes in is probably the most 
important asset you can have in 
your back pocket. Not only does it 
help in knowing where to find your 
classes, but it also makes planning 
your day a little bit easier. Knowing 
what dining halls are nearby, if you 
can stop by the financial aid office 
on your way back from class, or if 
you can walk with a friend from 
ERC to Revelle makes campus life 
so much easier. So, maybe set a day 
to simply walk around and make 
notes of where significant things 
are. 
2) Plan ahead
If you haven’t noticed, there are 
a LOT of people on campus. So, 
that means planning ahead and 
allowing extra time if you plan 
on ordering from the dining halls, 
buying groceries, or making a 
target run. This advice also applies 
to you rising sophomores out there. 
I know we all got used to 10-minute 
waiting times at OceanView 
Terrace, but now it’s different, and 
we simply have to adapt.3) Use your dining 
dollars
USE YOUR DINING 
DOLLARS! Do NOT buy anything 
with your own money when you 
could easily buy it from the market. 
Trust me, you’re gonna wish you 
had used them all year when it’s 
June 6 and you still have $500 
worth of dining dollars.
4) Use your 
student perks
As a college student, you are 
granted a lot of perks. For example, 
Spotify Premium and Hulu are only 
$5 a month instead of the usual 
$10. Use your student discounts at 
the local San Diego wildlife exhibits 
and museums. Embrace all the 
things that make being a college 
student tolerable.5) Find your space 
on campus
Especially if you’re living with a 
roommate, finding your space on 
campus is crucial to your sanity. 
Finding a nice quiet and beautiful 
place on this huge campus can give 
you the time to be alone, process the 
day, and simply enjoy life without 
the need of others’ company.
6) Choose a day 
to do your laundry/
chores  
Finally being on your own is 
genuinely thrilling and exciting, but 
the change does kind of mess with 
your environment and routines. So, 
in order to feel the most at home, 
I highly suggest choosing a day to 
do all the regular chores you would 
usually do at home. Pick a day when 
you know you won’t be stressed 
with homework, class, or work and 
do everything you need to do to 
be a functioning human being. Do 
your laundry, take out the trash, do 
the dishes, check your mail. Having 
these things preplanned will give 
you the relief you need to know 
that they will get done. It’s easy!7) It’s okay to go 
home 
Trust me, the last thing you 
would ever think you would want 
to do in college is go home. When 
I was a freshman, it took me 
almost until Thanksgiving to see 
my family. But what I realized is 
that while you are staying in San 
Diego, you still have roots in your 
hometown. It’s totally okay to feel 
homesick or simply just want to go 
home and see your dog! In fact, I 
encourage it. Whenever school or 
life is getting a little too stressful, 
plan a trip home and get away 
from it for a while. Think of it as 
a vacation: a time to re-ground 
yourself, or a time where you can 
remember how grateful you are to 
be away from home.
8) Save 
your money
Especially if you don’t have a 
job just yet, saving your money 
is vital. Instead of going out for 
fast food every night, why not use 
some of those dining dollars that 
never seem to go away? Insead of 
running to Westfield UTC for a 
new wardrobe, why not head to 
Pacific Beach (PB)  and thrift your 
heart out? Believe me, your money 
goes fast in college so it’s always a great idea to keep your finances in 
mind when deciding what to do 
and when to do it.
9) Explore
 San Diego
While UCSD is a GINORMOUS 
campus, there is still so much to 
do in San Diego. Head down to 
La Jolla Shores and spend the day 
at the beach. Head into PB for 
some shopping. Go downtown 
for concerts and clubs. Head to 
Mission Bayand Belmont Park for 
some summer-like fun, or have 
a picnic at Kate Sessions with 
spectacular views. The city is your 
campus!
10) Have fun
At the end of the day, college is 
more than your education and work. 
It’s about making connections — 
important connections — that will 
carry you through life emotionally, 
academically, professionally, and 
socially. Take chances. Say yes to 
(most) every event, party, hike, 
day trip, or concert. Y ou won’t 
remember your days in the lecture 
halls or in the office, but rather 
those enjoyable moments where 
you think, wow, I’ve finally made it 
to college.BY  B r a d l e y  B e g g s

HELPING TRITONS IN NEEDTRITON FOOD PANTRY
AT THE ORIGINAL STUDENT CENTER, LEVEL 1Monday: 9am-1pm
Tuesday: 9am-1pm
Wednesday: CLOSED
Thursday: 3pm-5pm
Friday: CLOSEDFALL 2021The past year and a half 
has been difficult for everyone, 
from the student body to faculty 
members. 
Speaking from experience, 
spending hours on end hunched 
over a desk while quietly dozing 
off in Zoom lectures has caused 
my work ethic to decline 
tremendously. 
So, to help pull everyone out of this pandemic funk, I have 
gathered some ways that could 
help us all readjust to life back on 
campus.
Get a planner
This one seems like an 
obvious tip, but utilizing any 
form of a planner or calendar has 
helped me transfer my mental 
notes into physical notes. During 
the pandemic, I admittedly did 
not use any form of organization because everything seemed to be 
readily available at the click of my 
mouse. With classes and campus 
organizations transitioning back 
to in-person learning and events, 
I have found that it’s going to 
take a little more effort to stay 
organized and on top of my work.
Catch up with  
      old friends
When the pandemic hit, I 
abruptly left in the middle of my 
first year, leaving the friends that 
I made within that short amount of time. Now entering my third 
year, I have found that keeping in 
touch with some of these friends 
has helped calm my nerves of 
not knowing anyone on campus. 
Besides, it’s always nice to catch 
up with people you haven’t seen 
in a while.
Reach out to 
professors and TAs
The thought of transitioning 
from online learning to in-person 
learning weighs the back of my 
mind because I’m unsure of how 
my work ethic and attention span 
have changed within the past year 
and a half. Remember that we are 
on campus and our resources are 
physically in front of us again, 
don’t be afraid to reach out to 
your professors or your TAs 
if you are having a hard time 
readjusting. They are there for 
a reason and ultimately want to 
see their students succeed during 
these uncertain times.
Create 
study groups
During Zoom lectures and 
sections, I found it quite difficult 
to reach out to my classmates for 
help as breakout rooms weren’t 
exactly the most comfortable. 
From the little time I spent on 
campus my first year, I found 
that it was easier to create small 
study groups with other students 
around me to create a small 
support system throughout the 
quarter.Get involved!
If you didn’t have the 
chance to join any on-campus 
organizations throughout your 
time at UC San Diego, now is 
your chance! Throughout the 
early weeks of the Fall quarter, 
the on-campus organizations set 
up their tables on Library W alk to 
advertise their specific interests. 
With the hundreds of clubs that 
are established on campus, any 
interest ranging from a cultural 
organization to a professional 
fraternity may catch your eye 
during this time, so stay on the 
lookout!

10/1 THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , SEPTEMBER 27, 2021| WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  16
 Obviously, having that first year 
in Division I be thrown into chaos 
by the pandemic must have been 
a big disappointment. What was 
it like for that to happen during a 
transition you’ve been planning for 
years, and how did you try to deal 
with it?
Well, I’m going to jump to 
one of our core values, which is 
resilience and having to deal with 
adversity. So we clearly had to 
move into that mode. It was — 
I’ll just be candid — it was very 
disappointing to be in a COVID 
environment, particularly with 
the fact that we had to cancel a 
number of our fall sports, so they 
didn’t get to compete.
On the other hand, we used 
that time to prepare our athletes, 
as far as conditioning and 
practices, and they were allowed 
to compete in the spring, so they 
were able to get something out of 
it. I like to look at the first year as an asterisk year for us, because it 
was so different. I actually think 
with it being different, that that 
somewhat worked in our favor 
in that we didn’t have the full 
competition across the board, but 
yet the year still counts towards 
our [Division I] reclassification, so 
it was good in that sense.
And last but not least, even 
though it was a challenge, and we 
were disappointed, those sports 
that we did compete in, we were 
very competitive. So that was 
good to see, that we’re in the right 
league and that we’ll be successful 
as we move forward.
Does having that sort of false 
start with the move to Division I 
shift some of the focus to this season, 
and what plans are underway for 
giving UCSD athletics the more 
proper inauguration it deserves?
The reality with COVID is, as 
I said, it was an asterisk. So this 
is the real year that we can get 
the word out to the campus and 
the community. So you’ll see a 
lot more marketing about UCSD 
going Division I both on and off 
campus, and that marketing is quite extensive.
We’ve done a lot of reaching 
out to the community and the 
students as well, so we’ll see that 
employed. This year, we’re still 
going to have some remnants of 
the COVID environment where 
we may have to limit fans, but the 
idea that fans can attend contests 
will make it seem like this is really 
the first year. I’m actually pleased 
that we kind of got our feet wet 
this year, we know more [about] 
what to expect. We also have 
some new recruits that came in 
with us moving to Division I, so 
I expect that we’ll be that much 
more competitive in the Big West 
Conference.
Now that UCSD is in Division 
I, there’s no more levels to move 
up on the ladder. If the goal now is 
to be a recognized athletic brand 
like a [University of Southern 
California], a UCLA, a UC Berkeley, 
what is the plan in the next five, 10, 
20 years to make that happen?
Well, I need to make a clear 
distinction that when you talk 
about Division I, there’s essentially two different levels. And when 
you talk about Berkeley, UCLA, 
USC, those schools are all 
football schools, and they’re in 
Power 5 conferences. So they’ll 
continue to get a lot more national 
recognition. Our goal would be 
to be very successful within the 
Big West Conference, meaning 
competing for championships on 
a regular basis. That said, it’s a 
non-football conference, so you 
don’t get the same amount of 
exposure. But I will say, when 
we’re successful in certain sports, 
basketball, baseball, volleyball, 
soccer, for example, we’ll still get 
that national exposure.
In the meantime, whether we 
win championships or not, because 
we have the capability of producing 
games on ESPN+, where we’ll be 
on that national stage somewhere 
between 150 and 160 times with 
various sports throughout the 
year, I would expect that we’ll 
get a lot of national recognition 
because of that — not just for the 
athletic piece, which is obviously 
important to us, but also for the 
type of institution that UC San 
Diego is. I like to describe us as a 
public Ivy, and one of the things 
that’s nice about Division I and 
being on TV is that we’ll be able 
to tell the story of UC San Diego 
beyond athletics. So in this five to 
ten year period, I expect to be on 
the national stage competing for 
championships in various sports, 
and again, even if we aren’t in 
the championship realm, which I 
expect we will be, we’ll have that 
national TV exposure and local 
exposure moving forward.
The shift to Division I isn’t 
completely uncontroversial among 
the campus community, especially 
for people who aren’t going to 
watch the athletes. What do you 
think Division I brings to a school 
like UCSD, other than just better 
sports?
Well, we’ve talked a bit about 
it, that the branding or national 
exposure is a big thing, because 
— at least it’s been my experience 
— the reality is there’s not a whole
lot of people east of the
Mississippi that know about 
UC San Diego, so the branding is a big piece. The other part is when 
you look at our campus, the fact 
that we have seven colleges, while 
that’s a good thing in terms of a 
small environment within a big 
university, it also has a tendency 
to cause more separatism than 
you would find at other schools. 
So athletics clearly would be a way 
to bring everybody together as a 
university.
The third thing I would 
mention is that the school spirit, 
the Tritons, the blue and gold, 
that’s not something that’s been 
a big part of UC San Diego in 
the past. So school spirit would 
be severely enhanced. I would 
also throw in that when you 
look at alumni engagement or 
connections, alumni that are on 
the east coast that can watch UC 
San Diego compete, that type of 
connection is really important 
to most universities. And then I 
would also throw in that you’re 
more likely to enhance giving 
to the university through an 
athletic program that has national 
exposure.
When we look at the 
community, not just the campus 
— and I’ve already seen it happen 
— the San Diego community, 
the fact that we’re Division I and 
now we’re competing against 
[University of San Diego] and 
San Diego State, we’ve become 
more elevated or connected to the 
community. I’m convinced that 
with this move to Division I, we 
will have many individuals that’ll 
come to campus to come to an 
athletic event, and while doing 
that, they’ll discover that there’s a 
lot more on the campus. So that 
just opens it up for the community 
as a whole. So when you put all 
those things together, the culture, 
the alumni engagement, the 
school pride, donations, those are 
the things that moving to Division 
I will enhance, and will enhance 
things significantly. Athletic Director Earl Edwards on Division I 
 and a UCSD “Renaissance Period”

The NFL season is well 
underway, and there are already 
some surprising shifts happening 
across the league. The NFC East, 
both the NFL ’s most valuable and 
recently its most inept division, is 
no exception. Here’s a look at the 
most surprising part of the new 
season for each team.
DALLAS COWBOYS: 
The defense is adept at forcing 
turnovers. 
The Cowboys defense last 
year was a sieve, and defensive 
coordinator Dan Quinn was 
tasked with turning this talented, 
but undisciplined defense around. 
Despite a crucial injury to edge 
rusher Demarcus Lawrence, the 
Cowboys defense has played 
aggressively and found success. 
While they did allow tons of yards 
to quarterbacks Tom Brady and 
Justin Herbert, picking off 2 passes 
each game gave Dak Prescott and 
the offense a chance to win every 
shootout. The turnover battle was preached in the offseason by 
the Cowboys, and this emphasis 
has shown results so far this 
season. Tackling issues have also 
improved, but the secondary, 
especially cornerback Anthony 
Brown, has struggled apart from 
its interceptions. If the Cowboys 
want to give their offense a chance 
to win games, they will have 
to improve before their rate of 
takeaways regresses to the mean.
NEW YORK GIANTS: Sterling 
Shepard is WR1 … for now.
With the big contract signed by 
prized free agent addition Kenny 
Golladay, most predicted he 
would waltz into the job as Daniel 
Jones’ preferred target to start the 
season. Instead, it has been long-
tenured Giant Sterling Shepard 
who has led the team so far this 
year. While the Giants have heavily 
invested in both their defense and 
offensive line, these changes so 
far have not yielded an uptick in 
results on the field. Although the 
Giants look mostly competitive, 
Jones still seems like he has not 
yet taken the next step. Shepard, 
however, is a great security blanket 
for Jones and is one of the better signs for the Giants as this season 
progresses. With Saquon Barkley 
getting healthier, Golladay and 
Jones getting more chemistry, 
and certain players, like tight end 
Evan Engram, coming back, the 
offense seems likely to get things 
on track, as the Giants look to 
at least be competitive in what 
is commonly thought of as the 
weakest division in football. On 
the defensive side, pass defense 
really has been a struggle to start 
the season. Allowing Bridgewater 
and Heinecke to light up the 
secondary is not a good sign for 
this team, and the lack of depth on 
the back end makes it likely that 
this will remain an issue. Still, with 
Shepard and Jones in sync and 
other areas of the offense looking 
ready to improve, the Giants 
might show signs of life sooner 
rather than later. 
PHILADELPHIA EAGLES: 
The defense has been one of the 
best in the league.  
The Eagles were one of the 
harder teams in the league to 
predict this season. Quarterback 
Jalen Hurts was a relative 
unknown, new coach Nick Sirianni made some uninspiring 
comments in an introductory 
news conference, and the team 
remained largely unchanged 
from an unsuccessful unit last 
season. However, it did seem 
like the Eagles underperformed 
last year, and maybe the veterans 
could come back rejuvenated with 
a new coach. While the Eagles 
have struggled with injury early 
on, the effort from the veterans 
on defense has been crucial to 
the success of the unit, keeping 
the Eagles offense in the game 
until Hurts creates an inevitable 
explosive play. 
Specifically, the run defense has 
been stout after not being an area 
of strength at all in recent years. 
The push from the front seven, 
likely buoyed by bolstering the 
depth for these position groups, 
has been a positive change for 
the defense, especially as injuries 
are starting to pile up. On the 
offensive side, there have been 
some growing pains. The young 
receivers have not been all that 
consistent to start the season off, 
and the dual tight end attack of 
Zach Ertz and Dallas Goedert has 
been mostly ineffective. In the mold of Lamar Jackson’s Ravens, 
the running attack with the threat 
of Hurts has found success. As 
long as the banged-up offensive 
line holds up, running the football 
and a solid defense should keep 
the Eagles competitive. 
W ASHINGTON FOOTBALL 
TEAM: The unimpressive pass 
rush. 
Washington’s pass rush was 
highly regarded coming into this 
season; with both star power 
outside and depth inside the 
defensive line, the team looked 
ready to wreak havoc on opposing 
backfields. So far, however, the 
team hasn’t been able to get to the 
quarterback as well as was thought. 
The defense letting up 29 points to 
the Giants certainly was not an 
expected outcome, especially after 
showing a better overall effort 
Week 1 against the Chargers. 
Now, W ashington has dealt with 
an injury to starter Matt Ioannidis, 
so some underperforming is to be 
expected.    BY   D o n o v a n   P e r e z - S c h i p p e r
