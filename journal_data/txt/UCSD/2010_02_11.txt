After a yearlong debate over stu-
dent priorities, the A.S. Council 
refused to raise student fees to fund campus transportation last night, when it voted to reject the Transportation Referendum.
The referendum would have cre-
ated a $25 quarterly undergraduate fee for busses and shuttles. Director of Parking and Transportation Services Brian d’ Autremont said the fee would have been necessary to maintain current levels of free public transportation, and that the initiative’s failure will result in the elimination of popular bus lines. 
D’ Autremont met with A.S. 
President Utsav Gupta and Chancellor Marye Anne Fox on Tuesday to discuss the referendum, with the Chancellor acting as a mediator between the two parties. 
D’ Autremont said he had hoped 
the council would see the transporta-tion department’s need for funding. Before the meeting, he said the ref-erendum’s failure would be a blow to sustainability. 
“I really want this referendum 
to pass because it’s important for sustainability, ” he said. “I think most people support this, and if it doesn’t 
pass, it would be a big hit for finan-
cially disadvantaged students. ”

results of the transportation survey sent out last April prove that stu-

A dozen security officers lined 
the back wall of Price Center 
Theater as Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren, surrounded by another half dozen escorts, spoke to an audience of about 500 people on Feb. 8.
Outside, 40 more gathered to 
protest Oren's visit to the school and his role in Israeli military affairs, chanting, “Occupation is a crime! Free, free Palestine!” and “Killing children is a crime! Zionists out of Palestine!”
Oren's presence stirred dis-
cussion of the historical dispute between Israelis and Palestinians over the West Bank, Gaza and Israel.
Oren — who was appointed 
Israeli ambassador in May 2009 by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — visited UCSD to speak about the U.S.-Israeli eco-nomic, military and political rela-tionship.
Tritons for Israel with Hillel of 
San Diego organized Oren's visit. Oren chose UCSD as one of the 
two schools in California he would 
speak at.
“We very rarely can have speak-
ers like this come to our campus, ” Pro-Palestine protesters 
filled Price Center toprotest Israeli ambassador Michael Oren’s speech.

Admissions guidelines for prospective 
nonresident applicants may become more 
lenient. A committee for the UCSD Office of Admissions is considering loosening applicant requirements as a strategy to lure more out-of-state students.
According to Campuswide Senator Tobias 
Haglund, a member of the Committee on Admissions, the committee is considering a system called the academic index score to admit non-resident students, instead of the more stringent comprehensive review system that is currently used to admit all students.
Haglund said the idea was motivated by 
state budget cuts. Admitting non-resident students brings in more revenue due to the additional fees they pay — $20,021 per year for tuition, as opposed to the $9,401 paid by residents.
“Since the state budget has 
been reduced, admissions has 
been looking for different ways to save money, and every piece of info they can use to increase

UCSD researchers have discov-
ered how to use an STD to treat skin 
cancer. 
A team of scientists led by Dr. 
Gregory Daniels, assistant clinical professor of oncology at the Moores Cancer Center, has engineered the herpes virus to kill melanoma, or skin cancer, tumors. 
When a foreign substance, such as 
a virus, is introduced to the body, the immune system detects the change and begins to fight the entire area, killing the cancer present as well. The cancerous cells are not usually detected because they are integrated with the body’s cells. 
According to Daniels, surgeons 
have been using viruses to stimu-late immune response to cancerous tumors since the 1880s.
“Y ou can inject anything into can-
cer and kill it, ” he said. “People inject weird stuff, and as long as it has toxic-ity, it works. ”
However, this treatment has been 
dangerous because some of the viruses made matters worse by spreading through the body, or causing cancer themselves. Now, the herpes virus can be engineered so that it is elicits the immune response while still being harmless for non-cancerous cells. 
Daniels’ team of researchers used 
recombinant DNA technology to delete the genes in the herpes virus that cause the disease and the genes that program the virus to spread, making it harmless to noncancerous cells while simultaneously eliciting an immune response. 
“We engineered the virus to delete 
harmful genes until we had a less robust version of herpes, ” Daniels said. 
The herpes virus was then injected 
with the protein GM-CSF, which initiates the inflammatory immune system. 
“This causes a one-two response, ” 
Daniels said. “The presence of the virus itself causes the immune system to be heightened, and by engineering it to carry the protein, we ensure that GM-CSF also creates a response. ”
Daniels conducted a clinical study 
in which 50 patients with melanoma were injected with the virus twice weekly. 
“We saw over 80-percent success 
[rates] in the tumors, ” Daniels said. “They just went away. ”
In addition, Daniels said the 
virus elicited such a strong immune response throughout the entire body, that 20 percent of the patients saw melanoma tumors disappear from 
parts of their bodies not directly injected. 
This type of gene therapy can be 
used for other cancers as well.
“The therapy can also be used 
for head and neck cancers too, or any cancer that starts from the skin, ” Daniels said. 
The next step is for the Food 
and Drug Administration to review Daniels’ study and decide whether this is a safe treatment for skin cancers.

EXPIRES 2/15/10Maybe because Valentine’s 
Day is rapidly approach-ing, or maybe because 
councilmembers needed a reprieve after last week’s eight-and-a-half-hour marathon meeting, but a new feeling of giddiness filled the air this week.
Campuswide Senator Tobias  
Haglund informed councilmembers 
that the Interfraternity Council will be holding a fundraiser next week to benefit the City of Hope Cancer Center. Joining the fra-ternity members imprisoned in a makeshift jail cell on Library Walk will be Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny Rue and A.S. President 
Utsav Gupta. 
John Cressey, a fifth-year and for-
mer A.S. councilmember, addressed the issue of council accountability during public input.
“Think of someone on A.S. that 
you can’t stand, and if the passion of your dislike for that person outweighs the passion you have for UCSD, then change your attitude or resign, ” Cressey said. “Y ou’re focusing on each other — that’s a Disassociated Students. ”
Campuswide Senator Desiree 
Prevo and AVP Diversity Affairs 
Jasmine Phillips explained the con-cept behind “Do UC US?” , a cam-paign that hopes to increase the num-ber of black students at UCSD.
They said they intend to pressure 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox  to create 
programs that will increase campus diversity. 
Campuswide Senator Adam 
Kenworthy  updated the council 
regarding his senator projects. Besides his proposed Committee on Student Activities and Relations and the A.S. Events Line, Kenworthy offered some new ideas: a changed location for the whiteboard experiments — this time, a bathroom stall — and a Geisel Library mascot.
AVP College Affairs and Speaker 
James Lintern offered up his speaker position for a week due to previ-ous engagements. Councilmembers eagerly sprang for the opportunity to 
chair the Week Eight meeting.
Campuswide 
Senator Katie 
Hall urged coun-
cilmembers to participate in the search for a new 
senior vice chancellor of academic affairs who will advocate the preserva-tion of social-sciences and humanities majors and programs on this campus. Senior Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs Paul Drake, who currently 
holds the position, will retire at the end of the 2009-10 academic year.
After various retroactive excusals 
of absences from previous meet-ings, councilmembers debated the language of the transportation ref-erendum yet again, and concluded their relatively short discussion with a failed vote.
VP Finance and Resources Peter 
Benesch submitted a proposed $5,000 underwrite for the production of the Muir Musical, which the council passed. 
Muir College Senator Ryan 
O’Rear  asked councilmembers how 
they would feel about former Muir College dining hall Sierra Summit — currently being revamped, and set to open in May 2010 — being renamed Timbers.
Councilmembers voiced their 
dissent, and O’Rear concluded that he would try to change the proposed name. );+W]VKQT<ITS[+PIZQ\a

After conducting imaging studies 
of the brain, scientists at the UCSD 
School of Medicine have discovered a neurological cause of anorexia that could lead to more effective treat-ment in the future.
The experiment began when 
scientists noticed that anorexia and bulimia tended to be passed down through family members. This indi-cated a genetic cause behind eating disorders and motivated Dr. Walter Kaye and his research team to begin searching the brain for an explana-tion.
They began their tests in the area 
of the brain called the insula which regulates interoceptive awareness, or the way your body responds to internal changes like a lack of food or oxygen.
Using functional magnetic 
resonance imagine (MRI), Scientists began testing the neurological reactions recovering anorexia patients to the taste of sugar. This machine enabled them to view changes in blood flow in the brain that occur as a result of neural activity.
In someone without an 
eating disorder, the insula releases hormones for plea-sure when presented with the taste of sugar, especially after a long period of hunger. 
However, anorexic indi-
viduals did not react as strongly to the taste of sugar, indicating a problem in the part of the brain that conveys rewards or emotions.
“So if you feel pain, or 
you hold your breath, then there’s dramatic change of internal body states, ” Kaye said. “[The insula] lights up and gives you a message saying ‘Y eah, okay, some-thing’s changed, something’s wrong. ’ [Anorexic patients] have an altered sense of self-awareness. ”
By decreasing the amount of posi-
tive feedback the body gets from food and genetically enabling an individual to resist food for long periods of time, scientists concluded that a deficiency in this area of the brain can predis-pose someone toward anorexia.
This deficiency in the function 
of the insula occurs as a result of an imbalance in the levels serotonin and dopamine. 
Dopamine is the hormone that 
gives a sensation of pleasure when your brain is exposed to food, sex, or drugs. Serotonin effects aggression and anxiety levels, especially in social situations.
According to Kaye, not only do 
those with anorexia not receive the 
heightened sensations of pleasure when exposed to food, but anorexics also experience an increase in sero-tonin levels — as frequently happens when one consumes carbohydrates — which can actually lead to increased anxiety when someone eats.
Researchers also found that 
these problems in introspective awareness manifest at a young age. Adults or teenagers with anorexia often exhibit childhood signs of anxiety, perfectionism, obsessive compulsive disorder or difficulty changing mindsets.
Researchers are hoping to trans-
form these findings into new treat-ments for anorexia and bulimia patients, or develop an early warning system.
Kaye predicts the project will con-
tinue for another five years.
“We’re working on finding the 
gene responsible for these, but we have a long way to go, ” Kaye said.
Anorexia is currently the psycho-
logical disorder with the highest 
mortality rate, and those suf-
fering from it are more likely 
to encounter other mental 
disorders like severe depres-
sion and OCD. Today, and 
treatment methods rely heavily on various forms of psychotherapy, such as fam-ily therapy.
The UCSD Eating 
Disorders Program will 
sponsor Eating Disorders 
Awareness Week, which takes place the last week in February and kicks off with a walk at Mission Bay at 10 a.m. on Feb. 21.

It’s true: Desperate times call for desperate measures. 
That’s why, next year, we’ll be paying more for a cheap-ened education, and why we won’t be able to cram at 
Geisel past midnight to make up for it. 
But the latest desperate proposal from the Committee 
on Admissions doesn’t involve sacrificing a seat in lecture, nor a late-night study session — in fact, it could possibly soften some of the cutbacks. 
Though committee member and Vice Chancellor of 
Admissions Mae Brown is tight-lipped about the idea (which is still in its early stages), there’s word from A.S. Campuswide Senator Tobias Haglund, who also serves on the committee,  that the pipeline proposal would ease up on 
admissions qualifications for out-of-state students as a way to boost tuition intake. 
We know that the purpose of the UC system has always 
been, first and foremost, to provide an affordable, world-
class education to California residents, but this has the possibility — if operating under strict regulation — to do more help than hurt. If letting in a few more nonresi-dents can put even the slightest dent in our campus’s estimated $80-billion deficit, this board thinks it’s at least worth testing out 
for a year — with a few stipulations.
Most importantly, we don’t support admitting more 
nonresidents if it means further reduction of in-state enrollment. This fall, the university already had to slice freshman enrollment by 2,300 students — and more cuts are in the cards for 2010-11. (Granted, if the UC Office of the President is true to its word, the damage won’t be quite as severe as last year’s — though we’ll believe that when we finally get off the waitlist next Fall Quarter). 
Gaping deficit or not, the university is still a state insti-
tution — one that can’t justify shutting out in-state appli-cants just to turn a profit. Resident applicants are on the rise — especially transfer students, whose applications are up 17 percent over last year. The spare change we’ d collect from more out-of-staters (who pay an estimated $21,191 in tuition alone this year) means nothing if we’re letting in fewer residents, seeing as their education is the entire rea-son for the university’s existence in the first place.
We also have to recognize that the committee might 
be spending time on a plan that could make an almost insignificant difference. Currently, the admissions depart-

The people at Banana Republic 
hate me. Not in an obvious way. They don’t throw things 
at me when I walk into the store or call me names to my face or tell me to “piss off ” when I ask them ques-tions. It’s not Wal-Mart, after all. 
No, the impeccably dressed 
employees of America’s favorite overpriced khaki retailer express their disdain in much more subtle ways. Discerning looks, disapprov-ing stares, gingerly upturned eye-brows and long, drawn-out sighs. Sophisticated ways, you might say. Sophisticated like pairing an argyle sweater with thick-rimmed eyeglass-es or having a job that requires you to wear a name tag. 
The sophisticated hatred of these 
sophisticated sophisticates wasn’t always so forthcoming, though. It only started last week, when, after realizing that I’ d been wearing the same pair of jeans every day for two years, I decided to update my wardrobe. In retrospect, this was a terrible idea, but I’ve been in a weird slump with the ladies the past few weeks and I thought a new button-down might help. I just had to figure out what a button-down was. 
Unfortunately, it wasn’t going to 
be as easy as strolling into a store and picking out a couple of new shirts. Unlike most Americans my age, I am morbidly afraid of shop-ping. Researchers claim that my demographic — the aimless, oft-drunk college student with too many credit cards — is a prime target for market-savvy retailers looking to sell worthless crap at ridiculous prices. If that’s true, then I’m the exception to the rule — particularly when it comes to dressing myself. There’s just something about clothing stores that makes me nervous. I get anxious. My head spins. I start to sweat. I stumble around and babble incoherently. I exaggerate a lot. 
This time would be different, 
though. This time I had a plan. This time, I decided, I would directly emulate someone else’s style, sav-ing myself the agony of trying to define my own look. After a brief Google search involving such key-words as “pants, ” “shirts” and “how to look good in pants and shirts” I landed on a GQ article lauding the messianic fashion sense of recently deceased salad enthusiast Paul Newman. Apparently, in addition to manufacturing one hell of a balsamic vinaigrette, Newman was also the shit — cool, calm, collected; an icon. He made ill-fitting cotton sweatshirts 
look good. He wore dirty leather 
boots. He rode motorcycles. He rode 
motorcycles . 
This was it. I would dress like 
Paul Newman.
I soon found myself standing 
timidly in the doorway of Banana Republic, my eyes blinking rapidly as they adjusted to the vague, noncom-mittal shades of beige that surrounded 
me. This was yuppie territory — a 
dangerous urban backcountry where people wear scarves indoors and REZA FARAZMAND

WEB POLL  
Do you think 
UCSD should accept more out-of-state applicants?
ZACHARY  WATSON /GUARDIANOPINION THURSDAY , FEBRUARY 11, 2010  THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 
ment is only slightly stingier with its 
“Congratulations” letters to out-of-state applicants than their in-state counterparts anyway. This year, the 33-percent acceptance rate for out-of-state applicants was only 4 percent lower than it was for California resi-dents. In addition, based on numbers from the last few years, Haglund estimated that only about 13 percent of out-of-state students admitted next fall will even choose to come here — as opposed to 21.5 percent of residents. Then there’s the reality that as fees rise and class sizes swell, our sunny Triton banner might not look quite as attractive outside state limits anymore. But there’s nothing to lose, as 
long as in-state enrollment isn’t cut more than it already would have been. More out-of-staters could certainly have visible effects in our already-stuffed lecture halls and dorm rooms. While Housing, Dining and Hospitality Services may have an impressive track record for squeezing three bunks into dorms intended for two, increasing the proportion of out-of-state students could prove hazard-ous with our limited housing options. Their extra fees would have to be funneled specifically toward making extra space, physically and academi-cally. Less stringent major require-ments could ensure that no one gets squeezed out of the system.The reason for enrollment slashes 
in the first place is inadequate state funding, so hosting a few more non-Californians — who don’t use a dime of taxpayers’ money — wouldn’t be any strain on the pool of state funds. 
These concerns are less urgent 
than they are ideological. As it stands, only 679 of our 23,000-strong student body (a scant 3 percent) aren’t from the Golden State — outnumbered even by our 974 foreign exchange students. Even if the admissions department does make this proposal a reality, we certainly can’t count on a fresh crop of out-of-staters to be our sole saving grace — but until the bud-get’s back on stable footing, there’s no harm in trying. 
Dear Editor,
The disabled John Milton (he was 
blind when he wrote Paradise Lost ) 
wrote, “ A good book is the life blood of a master spirit. ” Y et Vice Provost for Academic Planning Dan Greenstein said, “ A book is now a body of infor-mation that can be presented many different ways. ” 
I bought 60 books at 
Wahrenbrock’s downtown bookstore last weekend because Chuck Valverde died. But the store’s doors will close forever next weekend, as the book market is becoming increasingly technology-driven. 
UC Press Associate Director for 
Development Erin Marietta said, “The press’s reaction to the current business climate includes plans to pro-vide more digitalized books, expand its production of multimedia and continue to utilize online resources such as Facebook, Twitter, blogs and e-newsletters. ”
But where do you turn when a 
photo-sharing Web site closes unex-pectedly and with it go your pic-tures? A recent attempt by Facebook to change the terms of use for all users by shifting ownership of all content on Facebook to the company — with no warning and no recourse — offers an example of the risks associated with moving data or to cloud providers.
Garcia Lorca was “a master spirit. ” 
In addition to being a painter and a poet, he was a cineaste, a pianist, an arranger of traditional Andalician song harmonies. He and his troupe, La Barraca, popularized plays by Lope de Vega among the Chilean and Spanish masses. Between 1929 and 1935, Garcia Lorca went on a tour similar to that of the Rolling Stones (my generation) or the Counting Crows (your generation) — only it was a book tour throughout Europe and the United States, Mexico, Canada, Cuba and Argentina. But in August 1936, when the Fascists entered Granada (Garcia Lorca was born in Fuente Vaueiros, Granada, Spain in 1899), they found him there and shot him. 
They also burned his books in the 
Plaza del Carmen.
It’s happening here today, too. The 
librarian has already limited access to the computers in the humanities division of Geisel Library. Moreover, bookmark-sized materials distributed by the librarian emphasize the county-wide consortium — including UCSD and San Diego State — that has drasti-cally reduced public access in recent weeks, making it look as if Microsoft was behind the no-freebies-for-the-public policy change. Obviously, the students forced out because they can’t meet graduation requirements or lack resources will become “alumni, ” but that doesn’t mean they’ll be ineligible for Personal Identification Numbers.
When I asked the Geisel Library 
newspaper room supervisor why pub-lic access had been restricted to just three computers, she said Microsoft was in charge. It is the vendors’ call from here on in, according to the US Supreme Court.

where a man’s worth is measured by 
the thickness of his cashmere sweater. I’ d have to be on my game here. I’ d have to watch my back.
I walked inside and picked up 
a catalog. A quick scan of its con-tents revealed that the ideal Banana Republic customer is young, racially ambiguous and prone to such activities as walking little terrier dogs on foggy beaches, staring serenely out of win-dows and sitting in mahogany chairs. 
Never having done any of these 
things, I was already feeling discour-aged. My palms were sweaty. My leg was shaking. But I had a goal. I was going to dress like Paul Newman. “Pull yourself together, man, ” I whis-pered through clenched teeth. “Y ou can do this. ”
“ Are you finding everything 
alright?”
I turned around to see a short 
brunette in a wool sweater staring at me with raised eyebrows. She said her name was Kristen. Kristen the sales associate. 
“No, just Kristen, ” she said. Excusing her insolence, I told 
her I was trying to look like Paul Newman. 
“The guy from the salad dressing, ” 
I explained. 
“Y ou know he was also an actor, 
right?” 
Strike two, Kristen. But what she 
lacked in sense of humor she made up for in sense of urgency. Wasting no time, she scooped up a small pile of clothing and led me to a row of fitting rooms, where she instructed me to try on a brown cardigan and a V-neck T-shirt that prominently dis-played my complete lack of chest hair. 
Despite her best efforts, the 
ensemble made me look nothing like Paul Newman. I just looked like a guy who shopped at Banana Republic a lot. Kristen agreed. After seeing how awkward I look in a cardigan, she suggested I try on something called chinos, which, it turns out, are basi-
cally just pants. 
“They fit 
all wrong, ” I told Kristen. “I could never ride a motorcycle in t h e s e .”
I was 
starting to get desperate. She 
was starting to get impatient. I decided to take matters into my own hands. 
“If I were to roll up my sleeves and 
put on a tighter pair of chinos and wear this belt, would I look like Paul Newman?”
“ No.”“What if I put on this hat?”“ No.”“What if I put on this other hat?”She walked away after that, but 
I got the feeling she was strangely attracted to me. Maybe Kristen and I had a future together. Maybe I’ d move in with her and we’ d buy a couple of mahogany chairs. Maybe we’ d have a little terrier dog and stare out of win-dows and wear scarves a lot.
As I left the store, defeated, I 
noticed a group of employees watch-ing me intently, their well-sculpted eyebrows cocked at disapproving angles, their stylish, bespectacled faces narrowed in muted hatred. I understood immediately. In some strange, unspoken ritual, I had been banished from the shiny hardwood floors and cream-colored walls of Banana Republic, never to return. My experiment had backfired. I was still a terrible shopper. Kristen would never love me. Worst of all, I had failed to become Paul Newman.

dents support the referendum, Gupta 
said the results were skewed. 
“D’ Autremont says that — based 
on answers from surveys that the transportation system adminis-tered — students are in favor of the 
Transportation Referendum, ” Gupta 
said. “However, if you read the survey carefully, it states that students want user fees instead of reductions, which is not what d’ Autremont is offering. ”
Gupta said he believes there are 
alternatives to running a student-fee referendum. “We’re being blackmailed into mak-
ing a decision which is not the most beneficial for students, ” he continued. “There are other ways to find revenue than asking for money from students. ”
Gupta created an A.S. com-
mittee to lobby at meetings of the Transportation Policy Committee — the committee that is asking d’ Autremont to raise $3 million to 
maintain the current public-trans-
portation system. 
Transfer Senator Adam Powers is 
currently the only student representa-tive on the TPC, and will be working with Gupta on the joint committee. 
The council also tabled voting on 
the Athletic Referendum until next week,. That referendum would renew a $12 quarterly Canyonview Pool fee set to expire in 2013, and increase the 
fee to $22. 
The council nonetheless approved 
a referendum to charter a Sports 
Facility Advisory Board, which would oversee the use of funds generated by the proposed Athletic Referendum.  Readers can contact Angela Chen at shchen@ucsd.edu.Tritons for Israel President Dafna Barzilay said. “He has a lot to say, and he has ways of explaining the political conflicts to everyone in all spectrums of political beliefs. ”
Oren also spoke at UC Irvine on 
Feb. 8, where protests grew so rau-cous that they disrupted the event, resulting in the arrest of 11 students.
Oren said he encour-
ages discussion and debate; however, he did not agree with the extent of the Irvine protests.
“Freedom of speech 
is a right cherished by Americans and Israelis alike, and safeguarded by our universities, ” Oren said. “ As Israel's ambassa-dor, I am eager to engage all students in meaning-ful dialogue, but we must resist attempts to bring Tehran to American cam-puses. ”
Barzilay said the Irvine 
arrests made her worried the Feb. 10 event would be disrupted as well; how-ever, the protests outside Price Center Theater did not end in any arrests or major dis-ruptions to the event inside.
The rally was primarily led 
by members of the Free Palestine Alliance and Act Now to Stop War and End Racism. Most of those who attended were adults, although there were several students present.
“The reason we're here today is 
that we all witnessed with horror and shock the war crimes that occurred to the people of Palestine last year, ” Free Palestine Alliance San Diego Chapter member Mahmoud Ahmad said. “Michael Oren spent a lot of his time putting a positive image on a horrific tragedy we haven't ever seen before. We're shocked a university would invite him to speak here. That, in and of itself, should not be tolerated. ”
Extra security was called to Price 
Center to ensure Oren's safety.
“He's an international figure and 
an ambassador, ” Senior Public Events Manager of University Centers Tom 
Colley said. “It's our responsibility to main-tain his life. ”
Event planners 
employed security officers from UCSD, San Diego State University and the State Department, according to Colley. Attendees's belongings were checked upon entrance and all audience members were required to pass through a metal detector.
“We knew what to 
expect, ” Colley said. “We began inspect-ing the area at seven in the morning. Every trash can was emp-tied. Every area was checked. Everything was cleansed, and then we waited. ” 
During a public questioning peri-
od after Oren's speech, about a dozen attendees posed questions for the ambassador. Marshall College Senior Yuki Murakami inquired about Israel's treatment of Palestine.
“Y ou mentioned a prisoner of 
war of the [Israeli Defense Force], ” Murakami said. “There are over 10,000 Palestinian, including the children and the elderly, that are held by Israel as political prisoners. According to Amnesty International, Israel is the only country in the world to legalize the use of children. When will the torture end, and will these 
prisoners be free?”
Oren responded by stating that 
Israel has higher torture restrictions than the U.S. and numerous European countries. He argued that in actuality, they look to Israel as a model.
Students for Justice in Palestine, 
a UCSD student organization, was not involved in organizing the rally. However, they did issue a statement of condemnation, and a number of SJP members asked questions at the event.
“We encourage open dialogue and 
discussion, ” Students for Justice in Palestine Media Relations Director Leena Barakat said. “We did take advantage of the question-and-answer section, and we did our best to keep it as civil and respectful as pos-sible. However, they had cut our mics off for some questions, and did not allow us followup questions, which could be a free-speech issue. But he was here to speak and not debate, and we respect that. ”
Barzilay said she was happy stu-
dents posed difficult questions for the ambassador, because it stimulated discussion.
“I'm really, really appreciative of 
the students from the other end of the political spectrum who came in and were respectful and asked questions, ” Barzilay said.
At the end of the event, Oren 
thanked audience members for their attendance and participation.
“I've really enjoyed this tonight, ” 
Oren said. “I come to campuses to hear the types of questions I've heard today. It's important that I listen to you, just like you listen to me. The respect for freedom of speech is extremely important, and I'm grateful we had this discussion tonight — a civil discussion. ”

funding out of the state is important, ” Haglund said. “Switching to using the academic index score is one of the options being discussed. ”
Vice Chancellor and Director of 
Admissions Mae Brown said UCSD first implemented its comprehensive 
review system in 2002. The system awards different application factors — such as academ-ics, work experi-ence and leader-ship — certain numerical scores. 
The total pos-
sible points add up to 11,100 points, and 7,624 points is the minimum number UCSD requires to be admitted. 
Under the 
holistic review sys-
tem — used by UCLA and UC Berkeley — applicants are given a single score based on a more subjec-tive evaluation of their applications. 
The AI score includes only aca-
demic components — such as GPA and test scores — in evaluating applicants.According to Brown, prior to 
2002, AI and comprehensive review were used independently of one another at UCSD. The top 50 per-cent of applicants were admitted solely because they met the thresh-old of an AI score, whereas the remainder of the admitted appli-cants were evaluated using the com-prehensive review system.
According to Haglund, universi-
ties such as Berkeley and UCLA attract more out-of-state students — and their higher out-of-state fees — by using the holistic review system. 
“Berkeley currently has a 
monopoly on out-of-state students, ” he said. 
Haglund said that because holis-
tic review is less clear-cut than the comprehensive review system, it allows more leeway.
His data shows that 6,480 more 
applicants would be eligible for admission under a strictly AI score than the current system.
Currently, 97 percent of UCSD 
undergraduates are resident stu-dents. In Fall 2008, UCSD admitted 1,943 of 5,933 nonresident appli-cants, with an admit rate of 32 per-cent. Based on these numbers, the university expects 13.1 percent of admitted nonresident applicants to enroll. 
Brown said that these numbers 
are being used by the Committee on Admissions for analysis.
“There’s absolutely no proposal 
to go back to the way we used to do admissions, ” she said. 
Brown said that since 2002, the 
same comprehensive review system has been used for both resident and nonresident students. 
“The only difference is that the 
minimum GPA is 3.0 for nonresi-dents, while it is 3.4 for residents, ” said Brown. “This will continue to be the case. ”
Brown said that even if the idea 
was implemented, it would not necessarily affect admissions for California applicants, due to an in-state quota that must be filled. 
“The UC system set a target for 
California residents that we have to reach, ” she said.
 Haglund said that, though a 
proposal has not been drafted, the committee should submit the idea to the university’s Academic Senate. 
“This is something students 
should be talking about, because faculty definitely are, ” he said.

If this isn’t the devil’s 
music, I don’t know what is. Massive Attack 
is back, and their first album in seven years goes as deep and dark as we could hope from Bristol’s broodiest duo. 
Their latest is crepus-
cular music at its best — dark, melancholic and lurking, but never one-note or overbearing in its sadness./uni00A0It’s a canvas of effects that ring like a trip through Dante’s Inferno  
or the theme to the fall of Lucifer. 
Album highlight 
“Splitting the Atom” is one especially swirly mess of hell, narrated by freakishly talented devil imposter Horace Andy. The gravelly voicebox tells a macabre story —about a baby who chokes the same evening it’s born — then continues to touch on honey scars, burning suns and vertigo. The heady electronic beat, punctuated by a regular sharp screech in place of a drum thump and a back-ing chorus whispering incomprehensibles, ups the creepy shreshold.
If “Splitting the Atom” 
is the story of evil tempta-tion, “Psyche” — featur-ing trip-hopper Martina Topley-Bird — is a narra-tive of the long way down. Filled with metaphors about falling and rumi-nations about the moral decay of the soul, Topley-Bird sings plaintively over odd, reverberating guitar warbles that slide up and down the scale — mim-icking the chills up our spines — and builds to an emphatic chorus about taking the plunge. 
“Rush Minute, ” fea-
turing founding Attack member Robert del Naja, grumpily breaks the gloom with monotone vocals that get inanely pretentious about want-ing to both come clean and get high. The backing instruments become more noise than melody, and all intrigue is lost in a jungle of guitars.

For his directorial debut, 
Hue Rhodes should have left Dante’s Inferno  alone. 
A modern-day interpretation of the literary classic, “Saint John of Las Vegas” milks the connection between Sin City and damnation, but emerges with nothing more than a weak premise and even flim-sier characters.
In the original, Dante 
Alighieri, guided by the Roman poet Virgil, tours hell in an allegory for the recognition and rejection of sin; in “Vegas, ” John Alighieri (Steve Buscemi) is an ex-gambler who still compulsively buys lotto scratchers, and with partner Virgil (Romany Malco) he’s investigating an insurance claim in Las Vegas — involv-ing a stripper named Tasty D. Light, of course.
However profound 
the groundwork, the film lurches through the desert without social commentary or humor, and the bizarre characters try to compensate by overacting. Alighieri’s boss (Peter Dinklage) is a midget, and his girlfriend (Sarah Silverman) is terrify-ingly obsessed with yellow smiley faces, but their forced quirkiness only makes for an uncomfortable theaterful.
Lost in the Nevada waste-
land, it’s hard to tell what exactly Alighieri is struggling with (besides tumbleweeds). Theoretically, a personal transformation turns him away from sin at some point, but Steve Buscemi’s acting can’t quite show it; his only sign of growth is a cocky dance at a truck stop. 
Even with an ominous 
score to set the tone, “Vegas” fails to get off the ground, and even the film’s climax is buried under sideshows. Save $10 and watch the seven deadly sins flash atop the Warren College engi-neering building — it’s a quicker, less painful version of this travesty. ‘Dante’

you’re after the 
gift that keeps on giving — or stuck in a sexu-ally frustrated long-distance relationship — a Flip Video camcorder (HD, if you can spring for it) could make this Valentine’s Day worthy of the silver screen.
Of course, before you 
present that sexy some-one with his new pocket buddy, stock it with your own rendition of Beyonce’s steamy “Video Phone” music video or Shakira’s “Did it Again” (a blowup doll is best 
for any parts that necessitate a male counterpart).
If you’re in the 
mood for some-thing a little more creative, put your theatrical skills to the test and perform a tasteful striptease — that 
way, it’s something he can use to, er, “celebrate” Valentine’s Day all year round.

clear and sunny — so what better way to pay your respects to Mary Poppins than to go /f_ly a kite? Start your Valentine’s oﬀ with a picnic basket and a homemade paper-string contraption, /f_ind a secluded strip of beach and let your inner cutesy side /f_ly.BY HAYLEY BISCEGLIA-MARTIN

BY MATTHEW PECOT • ASSOCIATE HIATUS EDITORThis year’s Valentine’s Day comes at 
the midpoint of what is consistently the most arduous quarter of the year: Spring break is still too far away to 
fathom, and unrelenting waves of midterms seem to coordinate themselves with rain. So this Feb. 14, help your lover de-stress with a massage from RIMAC Arena, courtesy of the rec. department’s Weightrooms & Wellness 
program. Less than $60 buys him or her an hour of bliss — which could very well make the difference between a warm, romantic end to your V-Day and an action-less night on a cold pillow.
Sweetie, I’m so sorry. I had no idea when you said “Let’s take a break” that you didn’t actually mean it. I swear when I 
woke up sur-rounded by empty Dom Perignon bot-tles and strip-pers, your spar-kling eyes were the first thing I thought of.
Speaking for myself and every other sports nut I know, there’s nothing sexier than a girl that’s into sports. So, as Valentine’s Day approaches 
— instead of being the only questionable/creepy guy in Victoria Secret, or burning a Benjamin Franklin-sized hole in your pocket at some jewelry store or expensive restaurant — give a gift that expresses your love in way you both can enjoy: the 2010 David Beckham calendar. Now she has eye candy during the shirtless months (which are most), and she’ll develop such a crush on Golden Balls that she’ll always let you watch the game at her house. Plus, you spend under 20 bucks — triple play!

OK, I know what you’re thinking: Even if a stuffed bear is lovable, it’s still about as original as a heart-shaped box of chocolates. But no matter how predictable the form, once your lover runs her fingers through the soft pelt of a real-life (presumably slaughtered) llama, 
all clichés are off. Just try to woo her with its adorable-ness before any ques-tions of animal cruelty come up.

Instead of dusting off that “Romeo + Juliet” DVD and binging 
on sweets, drive down to Horton Plaza to see the greatest love story of all time in live majesty. True, Leo DiCaprio won’t be there, but there’ll be plenty of men in tights to ogle when the San Diego Ballet takes the stage. Set down those trufﬂes and get ready to “ooh” and “aah” as a stream of incredible dancers waltz by on tiptoe.

Let’s consider a couple popular pieces 
of animation: “The Nightmare Before Christmas, ” “Beavis and 
Butthead, ” “Toy Story, ” “South Park, ” “Finding Nemo. ” What do these films and TV shows have in common? Other than being embedded into our pop-culture DNA, they’ve been named by critics as our generation’s best. Apart from popularity and acclaim, however, they also have a much more intrinsic link unnoticeable to the average eye: all of their animators started their careers at Spike and Mike’s Animation Festival./uni00A0
Founded in 1977 by/uni00A0Craig “Spike” 
Decker and Mike Gribble — UCSD alumni and the owners of Mellow Manor Productions — the festival origi-nally promoted underground bands, holding film screenings (both classics and local work) after every show, and introducing them with animated shorts.
Over time, however, the shorts 
themselves became immensely popular, and developed their own cult following — outshining everything else in the pro-cess. Spike and Mike realized they had tapped into an unexplored niche, and named the phenomenon Spike & Mike’s Classic Animation Festival. 
Today, the festival is a haven for 
aspiring animators and filmmakers. Venues for nouveau animators to strut their stuff didn’t used to exist; the festival opened a space for diehards and new-bies to appreciate the art of animation.
Bigshots like Tim Burton and John 
Lasseter made their mark by premier-ing their short films through Spike and Mike back in the ’80s. As the years went by, more and more ambitious filmmak-ers competed to debut their films for the festival, and the genre positively exploded. It became more sophisti-cated — even cruder. Hence, the birth of Spike & Mike’s Sick and Twisted Festival, which has become the pair’s most famous endeavor.
Showcased at Comic-Con every year, 
this influential festival is responsible for the birth of “Beavis and Butthead” and “South Park. ” If you’ve come across a disturbing yet popular piece of ani-mation floating around the ’nets (I’m looking at you, Happy Tree Friends), chances are it was debuted to the Sick and Twisted audience.
“Humor’s the bottom line, ” Spike 
said. “ A younger crowd can appreciate artistic merits to have good time. It’s very accessible, and a fun time to escape the reality of the frickin’ world. ” 
Wherever the immature trend — 
childish fantasy, slapstick or crude and lewd — the influence of Spike and Mike is undeniable. Though Mike passed away in 1994, Spike has continued run-ning the festival.
Three long years have passed since 
the last Spike & Mike festival was held in La Jolla — but this year, it’s back.
Hold your horses. This isn’t the Spike 
& Mike you’re familiar with. Instead of opting for the more traditional Sick and Twisted, this year Spike decided to gath-er the best animated shorts worldwide in the past three years — regardless of sick-ness — to show at the festival. Tamely titled New Generation Animation Festival and hosted by the Museum of Contemporary Art in downtown La Jolla, this year’s event will value artistic talent and technical savvy.
“This is very high-brow stuff. The 
analogy I like to use is, if [Sick and Twisted] was 40-oz. beer, then this is vintage cabaret wine, ” Spike said.
The festival will play a compilation 
film, stringing all chosen shorts into one 90-minute extravaganza. It will be separated into three acts that highlight intellectual, technical and technological achievements. 
The first act opens with “Missed 
Aches, ” a colorful parody on lan-Spike and

Afilm that shoots for “Love Actually” and falls 11 months short, director Garry Marshall’s latest is a mess of flowers, chocolate, heart-
ache and migraine. Set in the not-so romantic city of Los Angeles, “Valentine’s Day” wanders from one cookie-cutter character to the next, wrapping exhausted viewers in a web of indistinguishable plotlines too haphazard and sticky-sweet to follow.
The star-studded cast is 
lead by Ashton Kutcher and Jennifer Garner — the former playing a florist who just proposed to his girlfriend (Jessica Alba) and the latter an elementary school teacher dating a two-timing doctor (Patrick Dempsey).
Garner’s character, Julia Fitzpatrick — whose 
name you won’t remember — is invited to an anti-Valentine’s Day party by her friend (Jessica Biel), who works for a woman named Paula Thomas (Queen Latifah). Thomas’ company represents sports star Sean Jackson (Eric Dane), constantly being pestered by a sports newscaster (Jaime Foxx) for an interview.
Confused yet? There’s more.Liz (Anne Hathaway) works as an assistant 
in aforementioned office — that is, when she’s not moonlighting as a phone-sex operator or 
schmoozing with her boy-friend (Topher Grace). And even though those plots and people were probably enough to keep you puzzled for a week, the film also stars Julia Roberts and Bradley Cooper, whose characters spend the duration of the film flirting on an airplane. 
If you weren’t already 
vomiting “Exorcist”-style at the thought of this Hollywood circle-jerk, Marshall squeezes in some tween “Juno” romance to get the acids churning, guaranteed. Emma Roberts and Carter Jenkins play the quintessential virginal couple hoping to do it for the first time, while Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner bat eyelashes by the lockers.
Accepting a role alongside the rest of the A-list 
is usually a good move, but each actor suffers from severe lack of screen time in “Valentine’s Day, ” making it impossible for any of the film’s talent to reach its full potential. It’s only during the romantic comedy’s closing outtakes that the cast is finally able to demonstrate the humorous geniality that was stifled by the schizophrenic plot.
With some heavy 
editing, a more selec-tive casting director and fewer excruciating tales of the nightmares of dating, there may have been breathing room for sympathy — even enjoyment. Instead, we’re con-stantly reminded that Hollywood has far too much money, and beauty, for its own good. 
And, although 
Kutcher and Garner’s charismatic personali-ties make up for their short bursts of time on 
screen, the film’s cheesy premise, terrible dia-logue and pretty-face overkill are sure to make this holiday bust a one-weekend wonder.

We tried to forget the rap-rock-infested early 
2000s, when Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach reigned supreme, but the Flobots shoved it 
back in our faces with 2008’s horrendous lyrical trap “Handlebars. ” Y ou’ d think they’ d have been relegated to one-hit wonder status, but for some reason, they’re still making music — and some-one apparently still cares. New single “White Flag Warrior” isn’t nearly as annoying as their first hit, but it’s pretty damn close. With the help of Rise Against lead singer Tim McIlrath, Flobots attempt to mimic Rage Against the Machine’s political schtick, only instead of Tom Morello’s innovative guitar solos and radical riots, we get an endless cliche of thumping bass and … rap? Great job, Flobots. Y ou’ve really outdone yourself.
— Arielle Sallai 
S/t.sc/a.sc/f.sc/f.sc W/r.sc/i.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.scLooks like the Barenaked Ladies survived the departure of founder/frontman Stephen Page. At least, that’s the impression we get from 
listening to “Y ou Run Away, ” the rock ballad memorializing the band’s mature but regretful resignation.
Former guitarist Ed Robertson takes on full 
vocal duties, having cut his teeth singing many of BNL ’s biggest hits (he improvised the rapid-/f_ire verses in “One Week”), and his smooth tenor successfully carries a gentle melody while a piano plinks quirkily in the background. Granted, the song’s subsequent buildup is a bit too FM radio, but its honesty is impossible not to take seriously. As the album approaches, one hopes the rest will be equally genuine.

Hot Chip
One Life Stand
EMI RECORDS
Hot Chip is a nerdy 
British electro-pop band with a penchant 
for synthesizers and irony. Susan Boyle is a middle-aged Scottish woman with an astonishing voice. Apart from average appearances, these two don’t have much of a connection, except that Boyle — that frumpy nobody from Blackburn — is Hot Chip’s muse. Well, kind of.
On their new album One 
Life Stand , frontman Joe 
Goddard said he wrote high-light “Keep Quiet” directly after watching Boyle’s per-formance of “I Dreamed a Dream” on “Britain’s Got Talent. ”
That’s not to say that the 
album includes music from “Les Miserables;” Boyle’s influence isn’t that obvious. But she has helped Hot Chip soften up a bit. 
“Keep Quiet” is quite the 
departure from the band’s most recognizable song, “Ready for the Floor. ”Gone are the days of tongue-in-cheek, club-ready dance grooves. Make way for soft melodies and heartfelt lyrics. Hot Chip strikes a delicate balance here: Even in its most rhythmical moments, its lyrics are actually rather romantic. Susan Boyle’s exis-tence has pushed Hot Chip out of its Devo-like tenden-cies into a New Order revo-lution somehow. 
The rest of the album 
follows suit. The excellent titular track tries out a bit of disco while spouting lyrics usually reserved for singer-songwriters with acoustic guitars. Singer Alexis Taylor croons, “I only want to be your one life stand/ Tell me do you stand by your man. ” 
However, Hot Chip’s 
newfound seriousness is not always welcome. The quietest song on the album, “Slush, ” is just plain boring. It’s cool that Hot Chip is expanding its sound, but it shouldn’t chuck its trademark com-pletely. 
Nonetheless, the album 
just might be its best yet — though it would have benefitted from a more obvi-ous throwback to the days of yore. “Hot Chip Does the Classics” would have been pretty damn entertaining.

Yeasayer
Odd Blood
SECRETLY CANADIAN
Ready for the overpro-duced cheese-pop colossus of 2010? 
Brooklyn’s Y easayer spent months laboring on it in an upstate New Y ork cabin with piles of tricked-out equipment. They culled sounds in both the bathtub and basement to reach holy-grail tones all in the name of crafting an unholy songwriting mess. Odd 
Blood  soaks up the dregs of 
Scissor Sisters — that Pure 
Moods  comp with Enya 
that my Mom rocked on cassette every day — and ’90s shit-techno. 
Our irony-blind trio 
debuted back in 2007 with the mildly intriguing All 
Hour Cymbals , which pil-
laged Animal Collective indie concepts and blended them with Barnes and Noble’s World Music sec-tion in a messy organic smoothie. Now they veer into Love Jamz infomercial 
tactics with huge, reverber-ating choruses in a futile attempt to beat the cool-curve by naming the next big thing: bargain bin.
Any terrible genre 
you can imagine is gor-geously captured on this LP: “I Remember” is the unforgettable synth ballad, “ONE” has faux-Afro beats and falsetto squeals galore and “Love Me Girl” hurls Backstreet Boys melodies into the mix. How did this threesome not real-ize how far they’ d fallen by idolizing Phil Collins’ yuppiedouche touch? I’m waiting for Kenny G and Chaka Khan guest spots on Album Three — if they were gonna go all out, they should’ve brought in the big guns.
Y es, lead single 
“ Ambling Alp” saves these hipster victims by revel-ing in its big-beat cheese, and the gooey hook “Stick up for yourself son/ Never mind what anybody else done, ” but it’s one of a few redeeming tracks where you can overlook trash-taste for genuine song craft. The rest of Odd Blood  is so musically 
confused it needs a cold shower and a few weeks’ rehab from Pitchfork’s tastemakers.

The Soft Pack
The Soft Pack
KEMADO RECORDS
After being drowned in flack for their controversial name, the band formerly known as 
the Muslims finally gave up and got a makeover. Under new alias, the Soft Pack are debuting their first full-length as the only San Diego natives to play at Coachella — not too shabby for Torrey Pines High School alums who used to deliver pizza in Del Mar. 
The self-titled album mimics 
three-minute classics popular in the ’60s, concise taste-testers of the band’s stylized garage-punk. Trading in overtly thrashy power chords for eye-roll melodies, the Pack give an aggressive nod to surf and punk-rock with enough angst to kill a small animal.
First single “C’mon” is a 
speedy strum-and-bass rush, Matt Lamkin pumping mono-tone don’t-give-a-fuck vocals (“Don’t have a look/ Don’t have the name/ Don’t have the walk/ Don’t want to talk”) to challenge the cuddly new band name.
“More or Less” shows off their 
SoCal surf-rock influence while criticizing the La Jolla lifestyle of the rich and selfish, complete with Beach Boy vocals and a stoney instrumental jam to end the song.
Dangerously similar to their 
beach-fried genre predecessors, the Soft Pack isn’t pushing any limits here. But they also avoid cloning their peers with low-fi blare, and remind us why we love unpolished garage crap. Their tardy entrance doesn’t condemn them outdated or unoriginal — rather, a fresh take on the well-studied, well-worn music we call surf-punk.

guage and diction, unveiling the illusion-of-
intelligence theme with slick animated pacing. Then, we move to the multiple-award-win-ning “Lapsus” by Gabriel Alfonzo, which plays with shape and structure while still somehow commenting the power of religion and faith (or lack thereof). Drawing out this sociopoliti-cal motif is “Stillwaters” — a claymation con-templation on trust — and “Crab Revolution, ” a hand-drawn reflection on the frivolity of life.
The second act is a technical feast, high-
lighting some of today’s finest hand-drawn, two-dimensional cel animation — “Santa the Fascist Y ears” at the top of the list. “Key Lime Pie” is a masterstroke in character design, and “The Hidden Life of the Burrowing Owl” mixes cel with documentary reel footage and slapstick. “Quiet Log Time, ” animated by fan-favorite Dr. Tran, is a brilliant study in punchline pacing, while “Yulia” is a beautifully sketched ballet set to a smalltime love story.
The festival, however, saves its best for 
last: The third act is riddled with technologi-cal breakthroughs. It begins with “Eleven Roses, ” a dark tale of unrequited love that cleverly shifts between 2D and 3D animation to fit the film’s changes in mood. It’s followed by brilliant stop-motion shorts “Western Spaghetti” and “ A Town Called Panic: Cake, ” astoundingly clever in their playful combina-tion of toys with the mechanics of animation. 
But they’re all topped by “For Sock’s 
Sake, ” which also uses stop-motion anima-tion, but combines it with 2D mechanics and sub-cultural geek memes to craft a piece of astounding depth.
Closers “Ghost of Stephen Foster” and 
“Oktapodi” hold the festival together, exem-plifying contemporary breakthrough. “Ghost” acts as a parody on the classic ’30s “Betty Boop” style while imparting dense subliminal satire in its crevices of crude humor, and “Oktapodi” utilizes Pixar-influenced charac-ter design to tell similar slapstick.
“It’s so fresh, so innovative — we try to 
keep it alive each year, ” Spike said. “These submissions are new ideas from new people. It keeps new cultures alive and fresh, not like trendy music. Animation brings things to life. It’s not like selling pizza; it’s more like creating new genres of music. ”

It’s true: Serenading your beloved 
on acoustic guitar (with what-ever sickly ballad tickles your fancy) takes the prize for sap-
piest gift — but there’s also no surer bet for a little Valentine’s action. While following John Mayer’s lead might seem kind of transparent, trust me: She won’t know the difference until it’s too late. D.I.Y. CANDY
BY KELSEY MARRUJO • COPY EDITORLor all those lucky enough to have a Valentine on the imminent day of depression and sadness (no bitterness here), do the world a favor and don’t be so predictable. If his favorite candy is Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, don’t buy him that crap in the holiday-
themed pink packaging. Instead, show him you really care by Googling the sweets from scratch. Abridged version: Buy some chocolate chips, melt them and leave them to cool in the fridge in individual mini muﬃn liners. 
Once hardened, spread some peanut butter (not the organic kind) on each of the pieces, then go ahead and repeat step one for the top layer. /T_he end product may not look as pretty as the CVS fare, but it’ll be just as bomb.

Leadoff hitter Saul was hit by a pitch, 
followed by a single from Junior catcher Michael Benton. Bauman, next to the plate, reached on a mis-played sacrifice bunt, and redshirt freshman Danny Susdorf — a transfer from the University of San Diego — tied the game up 4-4 with an RBI sac-rifice fly to center field to score Saul.
The inning ended exactly how it 
started, as Sedin was hit by a pitch, giving the Tritons the walk-off 5-4 win. 
The second game featured a 
dominant pitching performance by junior right-hander Daniel Simmons. He hurled a complete game, tossing seven innings of one run ball while allowing just five hits and striking out eight Wolves. Benton hit a two-run shot, providing all the offense necessary for the Tritons to win the game 6-1. 
The Tritons looked to com-
plete the four-game sweep at Triton Ballpark on Monday. An offensive explosion gave them an impressive 19-5 win. Each of the batters in the Triton lineup had at least two hits apiece, and the lineup finished 22-38 with a .539 batting average. 
Gregorich, Bauman and Benton 
all homered in the game, as Gregorich led the attack, going 3-3 with five RBIs. Senior right-hander Kirby St. John earned the win, improving to 1-1, tossing five innings, allowing five 
runs and striking out six.
Inspite of the emphatic series 
win, Rossman says the team is taking things one step at a time.
“We’ve got a talented group of 
guys that have been working hard since September, ” he said. “The prep-aration is there. Now we just need to concentrate on the task at hand, take everything one pitch at a time, and let our preparation take over. ”
The Tritons take to the diamond 
again this Friday, when they will host Grand Canyon University in a dou-ble-header at Triton Ballpark. First pitch is slotted for 11 a.m. 

In the last win of the series sweep over Western Oregon on Feb. 8, each UCSD hitter tallied at least two hits and finished with a .539 team batting average. 
Senior starting pitcher Kirby St. John pitched 5 innings to pick up the win, striking out six Wolf hitters. Three Triton hitters homered in the game.;\MILa7NNMV[MIVL<QUMTa,MNMV[M+IZZa<ZQ\WV[

Chico State fought back in the

“Our defense loosened up after 
scoring two runs, but it was a mis-take on our part, ” Lesovsky said. 
The Wildcats scored the winning 
run on a RBI sacrifice fly in the top of the eighth inning, then held on for the narrow win after two UCSD hitters stranded Belanger in scoring position.
UCSD will have an opportunity

defense is akin to Swiss cheese.
Y et, for all these shortcomings, 
France still has one of the most elite talent hotbeds in world football — due in large part to their tendency to naturalize quality players from the country’s former colonies. In Girondins de Bordeaux midfielder Y oann Gourcuff, they have a creative midfielder to fill the hole left by the departed French icon Zinadine Zidane. With the likes of Frank Ribery, the explosive rocket-like Bayern Munich attacker, Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema, the resurrect-ed Chelsea goal-getter Nicolas Anelka and the aforementioned Henry, Gourcuff has a wealth of options to send forward into attack.
On sheer tournament pedigree 
and raw talent, the French possess world-conquering potential. Potential that, in the very least, will see them top Group A.
My pick for runner up: Uruguay.The two-time World Cup win-
ners enter this year’s edition as balanced and capable as any other squad in this tournament. Led in attack by the Spanish League leading scorer — Athletico Madrid striking extraordinaire Diego Forlan — and Ajax starlet Luis Suarez, the Charrúas La Celeste Olímpica (as their sup-porters affectionately call them) have scorers accustomed to performing at the highest level. Also, the fact that Uruguay emerged out of a highly competitive South American field shows they can win important match-es in tough conditions.
However, if they don’t maximize 
their potential, their impressive quali-fication could be for naught — as an opportunistic Mexican side or a hun-gry host nation will undoubtedly look to spoil the “sky-blue” dreams.

 Okasaki and senior Raj Samra, 
in the first and second spots respec-tively on the squad, played well over the first 36 holes, but struggled over the final 18. Both shot final-round 79s after solid opening rounds on the first day. 
Wydra said the dis-
appointing final rounds were a testament to the conditioning that the sport requires.
“Golf is so much 
about flexibility, ” Wydra said. “I think that after playing 36 holes in day one, your body gets sore and tired. It’s like run-ning a half-marathon one day and going out for a five-mile run the next — your body is sore. That’s what happened to Keith and Raj. Their bodies weren’t doing a good job, and they were off because of t h a t .”
Samra had another explanation.“I didn’t get much sleep the night 
before the final round, ” Samra said. “I was studying for a midterm that I had the following night. ”
While a fifth-place finish might 
seem lackluster to an unknowing spectator, Wydra said the team did quote well, considering the compe-tition.
“Redlands, who finished in 
fourth, competes annually for the Division-III national champion-ship, ” he said. “The top three are full-scholarship schools that are able to recruit in ways that we can’t. ”
Okasaki echoed his coach’s com-ments, adding that many competi-tors came from schools with lower academic requirements.
“It’s a huge disadvantage for us, 
especially in this economy, ” he said. “Players will go to schools that offer them financial help, instead of here. 
We have higher academ-ic standards than a lot of these other schools, making it difficult to get recruits here. ”
UCSD’s rigorous 
admission requirements have taken a toll on Triton recruiting.The golf team lost two poten-tial players  this year because their SAT scores and GPA were below standard.
That reputation 
didn’t scare off blue-chip recruit and trans-fer Samra, who said that UCSD’s academic reputation — along with 
the opportunity to play so many courses — was exactly why chose to attend.
“[Wydra] was the only coach 
that came out to one of my commu-nity-college tournaments, ” he said. “I was going to go play at Sonoma State, which won the National Championship last year, but what really sold me was the opportunity to improve my golf game by playing so many courses. ”
Next up for the Tritons is the 
St. Edwards Invitational in Austin, Texas on Feb. 22 and Feb. 23.
UCSD will host two qualifying 
rounds for the team over the next two weeks to determine who will travel to the event.

SOFTBALL — Despite the rain, the 
Tritons opened their 2010 season at the Mizuno Best of the West invita-tional in Turlock, Calif. on Feb. 5. They finished with a 1-1 record — winning against Central Washington University 2-0, but losing to Chico State 2-3.
The team fought a muddy field 
almost as hard as their first oppo-nent. The Tritons started off on the offensive, scoring both of their runs in the first two innings, largely due to errors made by their opponents. 
Junior leadoff hitter Sarah 
Woofter was awarded first base after being hit by a pitch, and advanced to third on two Wildcat errors. Senior catcher  Nicole Saari then brought Woofter home by grounding into a fielder’s choice.
In the second inning, junior out-
fielder Lyndsay Gaylord took first base with a one-out single, stole sec-ond and took third with the help from junior Katrin Gabriel’s sacrifice 
bunt. Then, thanks to a Wildcat wild 
pitch, Gaylord came home to seal the team’s first win of the season. 
On the defensive side, sophomore 
right hand-pitcher Camille Gaito dominated the pitcher’s mound with seven shutout innings. Gaito struck out six Wildcats, allowed three hits and retired eight straight batters.
All-American junior outfielder 
Kris Lesovsky went three-for-four on the day. Lesovsky holds the highest single season batting average record 
in UCSD’s softball program — last 
year she maintained a .446 batting average.
In the second game, the Tritons 
held a 2-0 advantage over Chico State, but lost it in the seventh inning to a successful Wildcat comeback. The game was eventually decided in extra innings, when Chico State scored in the eighth to win the game 
3-2. 
Woofter started the scoring for  
UCSD with a single, then pushed 
into scoring position by Eliades’s sac-rifice bunt and Lesovsky’s single up the middle. UCSD women earned 
their first win against Central Washington, but lost to Chico later that night.

freshman Anubhav Rastogi finished in a tie for 20th at 11-over-par for the three rounds. Rastogi carded the lowest score of the tournament for the Tritons: two-under-par 70 in the final round. 
After struggling through the first 
two rounds, Rastogi changed his mental approach to the final round. 
He said he made some minor chang-
es before stepping on the first tee.
“I played smarter in the third 
round, ” he said. “I stopped shoot-ing right at the pins, so I didn’t put myself in bad positions if I missed the green. On the practice green, I switched my putting grip to one I used to use when I was kid. It was a little less fundamental and more about feel. ” 
Something worked: Rastogi got 
up-and-down on three of his first six holes, and tallied birdies on the first two par fives.
He got as low as three under 
on the round before bogeying the 13th, 14th and 15th holes. Back at 
level par, Rastogi gathered himself, 
bouncing back with birdies on the 16th and 17th.
Knocking his approach to the 
18th green to only two feet, Rastogi had a chance to break 70 — a magic number for the golf team.“[Head coach Mike] Wydra told 
me right before putting that I would be exempt for next year’s team and be on the roster for the [St. Edwards Invitational] if I broke 70, ” Rastogi said. “I have never been that ner-vous before. ”
With a shot at 69 on the line, 
Rastogi pushed the two-footer. Even with the miss, Wydra was proud of 
Rastogi’s performance.
“[Rastogi] got to a point where 
his adrenaline made him stronger, ” 
Wydra said. “He proved himself =+;,;?--8;075-;-:1-;JIMMY  KAN/GUARDIAN  FILE
The Tritons are 5-1 on the season at Triton Ballpark after completing a series sweep of Western Oregon University from Feb. 5 to Feb. 8.
By Cameron Tillisch  Senior Staff Writer
 
The No. 3 UCSD baseball team completed a four-game sweep of No. 18 Western Oregon University last weekend. The Tritons showcased an even balance of offense and pitching over the weekend, proving themselves a worthy of a top seed in the conference.
The Tritons improve to 5-1 overall, and the 
Wolves fell to 0-4.
On Friday, the Tritons set the tone for the series, 
opening with back-to-back home runs off the bats of senior shortstop Vance Albitz and senior outfielder Robert Sedin. They won the game 12-6.
“We had a pretty solid weekend all around, ” 
senior pitcher Matt Rossman said. “We came out on Friday and knocked around their guy pretty good, and set the tone for the weekend. ”
Albitz was a triple shy of the cycle, going 4-5 with 
an RBI and a run. Junior outfielder Aaron Bauman, a Santa Barbara City College transfer, was key to the offense, going 3-4 with a pair of runs and RBIs. UCSD had a stellar offense showing overall, giving junior right-hander Tim Shibuya plenty of breathing 
room. He finished the day with seven innings of work, giving up four earned runs with a walk and a couple strikeouts. 
On Sunday, the Tritons hosted a double-header 
with Western Oregon for the midsection of the series. Junior closer Guido Knudson earned the first victory, hurling two scoreless frames and striking out two. Senior right-hander Matt Rossman started the game for UCSD, throwing seven shutout innings and allow-ing one earned run while striking out seven. 
In the bottom half of the fifth, junior third base-
man Evan Kehoe and senior first baseman Brandon Gregorich got on base with back-to-back singles and one out. When junior outfielder Kyle Saul stepped up to bat, he promptly drove a three-run shot over the left field fence to give UCSD the 3-1 lead. 
UCSD was threatened in the seventh after Western 
Oregon scored an unearned run, taking the score to 3-2. However, they couldn’t manage to score the insurance runs they needed to pad the lead, and soon found themselves down 4-3 heading into the ninth.
In the bottom of the ninth the Tritons rallied.

On Dec. 4, the draw for the 
2010 FIFA World Cup Finals in South Africa was decided, 
and the 32 qualifying nations were split up into the customary eight groups of four teams. 
Each year without fail, a few of 
these groups take on new personali-ties, generating drama and unpredict-ability of end results, for which pre-tournament seeds cannot account.
In the months leading up to the 
tournament in June and July, I will attempt to profile each group.
Kicking off the series is Group A; 
featuring host nation South Africa, WC06 runners-up France, a Mexican 
team with untapped potential, and the 
talented yet unproven Uruguay.
Group A power dynamic: Talent 
does not guarantee results. 
The host nation could not have 
asked for a more complicated draw — one that will jeopardize the Bafana Bafana’s chances for emerging from the group. The South Africans are the group’s supreme underdogs, and will be counting on their fans’ energy and “host nation” mojo in order to advance.
While the French and the 
Uruguayans have both seen rocky roads to qualification, the raw talent on each side is on par with the best in the world. Team chemistry pending, both sides emerge on paper as the group’s power brokers.
Mexico qualified behind the U.S. in 
qualification in the North and Central American regions. However, the team has proven pedigree at the highest level of competition, and is led by wily manager Javier Agguire — who, after coaching in Europe for the majority of the last decade, is well-versed in tactics at the highest level. However, any path to the round-of-16 will be through the men in blue: the French. 
Group Winners: France.Barcelona forward Thierry 
Henry’s handball against Ireland in European qualification has shrouded the team and the talismanic striker in controversy — some in France have even expressed shame over the way in which they qualified. On top of “handgate, ” their mercurial manager Raymond Domenech has done little to instill confidence in the Le Bleus faithful: His sporadic player selections have stifled team chemistry, and his Just
