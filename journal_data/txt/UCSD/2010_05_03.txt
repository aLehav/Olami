Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
announced April 27 that he will refuse to sign any 
state budget that does not contain increased funding for California’s public colleges. The budget will be submitted  to the state legislature by May 14.
At an April 27 meeting with 
top administrators — including UC President Mark G. Yudof — Schwarzenegger said he is committed to restoring funding to California’s public colleges and universities and will not sign the new state budget unless it does so. 
The promise falls in line with  the 
spending plan Schwarzenegger intro-duced in January, which proposed to return more than $848 million to the University of California, the California State University system and California community colleges 
after a total of $1.7 bil-lion was cut from their budgets last May — of this, $237.9 million go toward expanded finan-cial aid. The state short-fall has led to higher 
student fees, enrollment cutbacks and employee furloughs across the board.
“[This is] just to let the legisla-
ture know that  — as they deliberate the budget and set their priorities  — he makes it clear what his prior-ity is in terms of higher education, ” education-program budget manager  for the State Department of Finance Jeannie Oropeza said.  
Schwarzenegger’s January pro-
posals included a 2.5-percent fund-ing increase for the UC system — which would restore about $305 mil-lion in funds cut from the university this year, — along with $51.3 million meant to preserve open access for an 
Schwarzenegger’s 
proposed budget would return $51.3 million to UC financial aid.

A.S. Store 
Charter Finalized
By Ayelet Bitton

After nearly a year of planning, 
the A.S. Council will vote this week 
on a charter for its new enterprise: an apparel store scheduled to debut in Price Center by Fall Quarter 2010.
Campuswide Senator Tobias 
Haglund said the total budget for the store has not been finalized, but esti-mated that initial operating costs could reach $100,000.
“The starting cost will be the largest 
that A.S. will have to invest in the store, ” Haglund said. “The by-year cost will be significantly lower. ”
According to Vice President of 
Finance and Resources Peter Benesch, rent for the store’s 650-square-foot Price Center location — above Price Center 
Theater and directly adjacent to Outback Adventures — will be $1 to $2 per square foot, for a total cost of $650 to $1300 per month. 
Haglund said 
the store is not expected to turn a profit within its first 12 months of opera-tion.
“It’s obviously 
not going to be profitable in a year, because you’re not going to have $100,000 in a year, ” 
he said. “I mean, you might, but busi-ness logic would say probably not. ”
Benesch agreed.
“The sole purpose of the A.S. store 
is not to make profit  — it is also to 
provide the students with a service, ” Benesch said. “But not at the expense /W^8ZWUQ[M[5WZM.]VL[\W+ITQNWZVQI=VQ^MZ[Q\QM[

Arizona’s newest immigration 
bill — which requires immigrants to 
carry legal documentation on them at all times — has caused mass pro-tests to break out across the country, including in San Diego. A number of incoming freshmen at the University of Arizona have also repealed their intent to enroll.
SB 1070, or the “Support Our Law 
Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods 
Act, ” was signed into law by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer on April 23. Failure to produce documentation is now 
a misdemeanor under Arizona state law. Proponents of the reform argue it was motivated by the current eco-nomic crisis, as non-taxpayers place a financial strain on public services like health and education.
The bill stipulates that any ille-
gal immigrant found on Arizona soil is trespassing, allowing officers to request documentation if given rea-sonable suspicion that someone is an illegal alien. Those who oppose the reform contend that it encourages racial profiling. 
In the first version of the bill, 
officers would be allowed to demand proof of legality upon any “lawful contact” — including incidents such as a civilian asking an officer for directions. However, it was rewrit-ten on April 30 to stipulate that an individual has to first engage in some kind of unlawful action — prompting a “stop, detain or arrest” — before an officer can ask for papers. Executives 
like Brewer said that this clarification 
proves that the intent of the act is not to encourage racial profiling.*()<+.,;*90:0:.6=,9569790690;0A,:/0./,9,+<*(;06505

AS PER USUAL By Dami Lee
TWO COKES SHORT By Sam Pelle
additional 5,121 students in the UC 
or CSU systems who are currently not being funded. He also proposed that $367 million be returned to the CSU system, and $126 million be returned to the community-college system. However, these numbers are not official, as Schwarzenegger has not presented his final proposal.
According to Oropeza, 
Schwarzenegger is working with the higher-education figureheads at the meeting and the State Department of Finance, largely, to land on more specific numbers for the budget.
The State Department of Finance 
is waiting to receive final total rev-enue estimates before it determines where the funds should be allocat-ed. Typically, the state treats the UC and CSU systems  equally in terms of 
monetary support, while the state’s community-college system falls under Proposition 98 — which guar-antees them a certain amount of state spending, along with public  funding for K-12 schools.
“We think [Schwarzenegger is] 
showing greater leadership in this issue, ” UCOP spokesperson Steve Montiel said. “With all that we have fought in the budget process, it would be a big step forward. It would put us on much better footing than we’ve been this year. ”
Montiel added that, though the 
proposed funding increase would not fully cover the system’s budget deficit, it would at least ease the financial strain of the UC system.
“It would also provide some 
money to make sure at least some of the students that are unfunded by the state right now get funded, ” Montiel said. “There currently are 14,000 students who are not funded by state, and the 51.3 million would fund some of them, but not all of them. ”
The proposal is a departure from 
last year, when Schwarzenegger pro-posed to eliminate the Cal Grant pro-gram completely. Now, he proposed a $101 million increase for Cal Grants in his January budget, the state’s main financial-aid program for college stu-dent, said Oropeza.
The meeting marked the 50th 
anniversary of the state’s Master Plan for Higher Education, which pro-vided more financial aid for students to enter into California’s higher-edu-cation systems. 
Attendees also reviewed a report 
by the Public Policy Institute of California entitled “Higher Education in California, ” which stressed the importance of in-state enrollment, transfer-student enrollment and four-year graduation plans. If these are not improved, according to the report, the state will have one mil-lion fewer college graduates in the workforce than needed by 2025. The report was released in light of UC Berkeley’s reduction of its freshmen class by 1 percent and enrollment of  15 percent fewer Californians while nearly doubling the number of non-resident students.
According to Oropeza, 
Schwarzenegger agrees with the report, and sees higher education and the preservation of the Master Plan as a priority while maintain-ing the economic demands of California. 
She said that if the legislature 
passes a budget that the governor 
does not approve, he can veto it. 
Schwarzenegger will present his 
official state budget on May 14, at which point the state legislature will present a budget for him to approve and sign.

Senior Staff WriterThe legislation has prompted a 
widespread boycott. Organizations like the American Immigration Lawyers Association — which is based in Washington, DC — have targeted Arizona’s tourist industry by canceling conferences previously held in the state. Independent truck-ers based in Arizona and California announced plans for a five-day boy-cott, during which they will refuse to freight goods in or out of the state.
In a letter released on April 29, 
University of Arizona President Robert Sheldon announced that admits for next year had begun with-drawing from the school, saying they would rather attend institutions out-side the state than risk being sub-jected to racial profiling.
“We have already begun to feel 
an impact from SB1070, ” Sheldon said. “The families of a number of out-of-state students — to date all of them honors students  — have told us that they are changing their plans, and will be sending their children to universities in other states. ”
Additionally, some critics of 
the bill — like Rep. Jose Seranno (D-NY) — have called for Major League Baseball to relocate the Major League All-Star Game from Phoenix in response to the new reform, which they perceived as discriminatory.
Some UCSD students joined in 
the protests as well. According to A.S. Vice President of External Affairs Gracelynne West, immigration-rights activists-held a candlelight vigil by Geisel Library on Monday, just after the bill passed. 15 students also trav-eled to Phoenix in order to take part in the May Day protests against the new law.
West said there will be a call-in 
day on Wednesday, when organiz-
ers will encourage students to call the office of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) to express their displeasure with Arizona’s new immigration law. West said she hopes that the effort will discourage similar legislation from passing in California.
“What happened in Arizona real-
ly sets precedents for what might happen in other states, especially California, ” West said. “The call-in … is so she receives the message that students at UCSD are really unpleased with what’s been hap-pening in Arizona. We just want to make sure that —when immigration reform is coming up at the federal level — that [Feinstein] really takes that into account. ”
The Arizona bill will go into full 
effect on August 24, 2010.

of being able to at least maintain itself financially, as well as reserve capital, should it require any improvements in the future and so on. ” 
Councilmembers originally pre-
dicted that the store would open last December. However, the opening was repeatedly pushed back as council-members had trouble finding informa-tion to draft a business proposal. 
Benesch said VP Finance and 
Resources-elect Andrew Ang will have to invest a large amount of time to open the store by fall. 
“Hopefully, if we can get this 
approved ... by the end of the quar-ter, we can have it open by Fall Quarter, ” Benesch said. “The next Vice President of Finance would have to hit the ground running for the store to open in the fall. ”
Ang said that he is interested in 
gauging student opinion in a follow-up review of the business next year. He said he will try to find out how receptive students are to the store, alongside its financial figures.
“From what I know, the criteria 
I’ll be looking for is how popular I guess you can say it is with the general student body, how often it is being used and how the student organizations take advantage with the resources there and how much profit it makes, ” Ang said.
The store’s charter includes a 
clause calling for a review of the enterprise after the first year of oper-ations, which the council will use to review the project and determine whether to renew the charter. 
Haglund said the one-year charter 
reapproval plan may prove problem-atic, as next year’s council will be comprised of representatives unfa-miliar with the project.
“The concern with the one-year 
trial thing is just making sure we like it enough to keep it around, ” Haglund said. “We thought, originally,  that would ease people minds about how much money it might cost to open the store and making sure it’s going to be profitable. ”
Haglund said the one-year charter 
could prove harmful to the store. 
“We thought that the one-year 
expiration date on it  — and having basically to reapprove the charter in a year — it would give the council a chance to look it over again, ” Haglund said. “But the reason it might not be as good is because you will have one council approve the one-year charter ,and it’s going to be another council that [does it] next year. We’re not exactly sure how good that is. ”

Arnold Schwarzenegger stated he will refuse to 
sign the fiscal year 2010-11 budget until funds are restored to the University of California, the California State University and state communi-ty-college systems. Although late in the game, it’s a noble gesture from our soon-to-be-retired state leader that shouldn’t go unpraised. 
But even if the Governator manages to 
intimidate a couple state representatives into backing higher education, it won’t mean as much if thousands of students are still unable to afford a college education. Though the gov-ernor’s proposed budget would restore $848 million to higher public education — a 12-per-cent increase from last year’s $746 million — it comes hand-in-hand with one glaring problem: Competitive Cal Grants will be cut entirely for the 2010-11 fiscal year. 
Every year, 22,500 Competitive Cal Grants 
are granted — primarily to cover undergraduate tuition and expenses for low-income commu-nity college students. After barely surviving last year’s budget cuts, the $35 million program now faces elimination altogether.
Three days before the March 4 Day of Action protests, Gov. Schwarzenegger promised to preserve the Competitive Cal Grant if the state saw an increase in tax revenue. Come Tax Day, the state collected a 3.9 percent increase in tax receipts — enough to fund the competitive grant, though apparently still not quite enough to have Schwarzenegger make good on his word. 
By suspending the Competitive Cal Grant, 
Schwarzenegger is eliminating a primary source of scholarship funding for over 20,000

Like a Side of  Saliva With That?
Working in a dining hall 
for the past two years, I’ve noticed on-campus 
eateries are microcosms of the UCSD social scene. 
The frats and sororities travel 
in color-coordinated packs, gnaw-ing on bacon cheeseburgers. Sports teams — decked in blue-and-gold sweats and windbreakers — usually claim half a dozen adjoined tables for their late-night smoothies and salads. And then there’s a collection of smaller groups — the hipsters, the engineers, the international stu-dents — trickling through the hall in twos and threes.
We workers, however, have a 
relatively unchanged interaction with all species of student: what I like to call an over-the-counter relationship. Of course, a physical counter does exist between us, but I’m referring more to the limitations of our association. 
Many times, I have smiled and 
started to wave at a customer in Price Center before realizing that our conversations have never pro-gressed beyond the realm of what kind of bread they want on their sandwich. At this point, I shove my hands in my pockets and find relief in the fact that they probably don’t recognize me without my uniform. That, or the layer of grease from the fumes of the deep-fryer that covers my face during my shift.
Our relationship is distant even 
when we are standing five feet apart and I am tending to your cheese-burger. Every hour on the hour, hundreds of freshmen and sopho-mores are released from the world of biochemistry, and immediately rush to the nearest dining hall. It’s true: Every other underclassman has the same gurgling hunger at the same time, and the line at the grill stretches all the way back to Black’s Beach. But as inconvenient as this rush of business is, at least it spares us the awkward silence that descends when there is no chaos or competition for our attention. 
When there’s a line, neither the 
worker nor the customer feels any responsibility to engage the other. When orders and hamburger buns are flying through the air, everyone is content to just get out of there with a half-decent meal and not a word edgewise.
At slow moments, when you 
mercifully interrupt my eternal boredom of rearranging cheese and refilling bins of onions by ordering a sandwich, I am initially somewhat (pathetically) excited at the chance to do something other than think about my paper on Marx. Once I have started the order, however, we are both left with nothing to do but stare at each other and listen to the patties sizzle. 
As the clock ticks, my blood 
pressure rises. I can feel your hun-gry eyes, both on me and your chicken breast. To avoid some insufferable conversation about the fickle San Diego weather, I turn my back and pretend that poking at

Task Force, A.S. Divestment Resolution
We have a historic opportu-nity to stop our university from contributing to the 
violation of human rights. This is a controversial issue, as all movements for social justice are. 
But let us be clear: The contro-
versy surrounding the Peace and Neutrality Through UC Divestment From U.S. Corporations Profiting From Occupation resolution has not been created by any student group on campus, but by the University of California’s decision to invest in 
corporations involved in tremendous 
violations of international law. 
Two of these corporations 
are General Electric and United Technologies. They were mentioned in the resolution for their involve-ment in well-documented human-rights abuses in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. These are not casual accusations: These corporations have 
been well-researched, and the fact is 
that our university has invested $136 million in General Electric and its subsidiaries, which contributes to the manufacturing and delivery of weapons in these occupied territories. Because many students have relatives who live in occupied territories, such investments force them, in effect, to fund the bombs that are dropped on their families. This is not a choice any student should have to make.
Due to the UC system’s involve-
ment, the conflict in Israel and Palestine may be a difficult one to hear about, but it is not a difficult one to understand. The Palestinian people suffer from the longest ongo-ing illegal military occupation in the world. No matter how you spin 
it, a military occupation by another 
power implies the curtailment of civil liberties and the lack of democracy. 
So why write a resolution that 
references Israel, one might ask? The answer is simple. The U.S. gives the Israeli government approximately $8 million a day, and the vast majority of that money is spent on its military. That sum is more than we give to 
any other country in the world. This 
money is often used for illegal war materials such as white phospho-/=-;<+755-6<):1-;

President, Tritons for Israel
As a student leader and voice of the pro-Israel community on campus, I left the A.S. 
Council meeting last Wednesday at a late hour with pride in the council, my community and, most impor-tantly, my Israeli nationality. More personally, I left with dismay and hopelessness after what I had just faced inside the chambers on the fourth floor of Price Center East.
The room was divided before the 
open forum even started. With pre-made posters, shirts and information-al binders for the A.S. Council, each 
clearly prepared by the student orga-
nizations in disagreement, the meet-ing looked more like a rowdy soccer game crowd than a formal A.S. meet-ing. When the public forum opened, student by student made his or her way to the microphone, carefully explaining why the proposed resolu-tion is important or why it is unfair. While many students explained the 
rationality behind their arguments — 
backing it up with political sources, facts and possible consequences — many personal grievances turned into what looked to me like a pity fight. Each personal story — whether in Israel, the West Bank or Gaza — tried to be presented as more painful than the one before, and therefore more persuasive in the discussion of whether A.S. Council should vote for or against the resolution. 
I found it absolutely dumbfound-
ing that so many people saw the resolution as black-or-white. If it were passed, the pro-Palestinian community would have felt as if all its hard work on drafting this bill had paid off, but that it had left another community angry. If the bill were 
rejected, the pro-Israel community 
would have felt as if its fight to keep the community united was a suc-cess, but stayed apathetic in the cause toward helping the suffering of peo-ple in the region. It was as if I were the only one who noticed that we all shared one goal: to end suffering on both sides of the conflict. 
My main issue with the whole 
resolution and its debate pertains exactly to this problem. If we all want the same result, why don’t we take the same steps to get there? Why do we continuously blame one side without looking at the big picture?

Dear Editor,
As an active UCSD alumnus from 
Revelle College, I am appalled that 
— even after six hours of emotional debate Wednesday night — the stu-dent government still did not have the clarity to recognize hatred masked in the disguise of divestment, and proceeded to reject the proposed anti-Israel bill outright. The bill violates the rights of thousands of UCSD stu-dents who have no choice but to pay their student fees, and they are legally entitled to be assured that these man-datory fees are not used to empower the political aims of an extremist and hostile group that seeks to promote one-sided propaganda against Israel. Student fees must be invested in a non-discriminatory way without regard to the political whims of a block of students. This could become a legal battle over the rights of all students.

Dear Editor,
The move to pressure the uni-
versity to divest from investments in Israel is a shallow, unjust, wrong-headed strategy that will never result in anything positive. Have you stud-ied the history of the Middle East? The first Jewish temple was built in Jerusalem centuries before the birth of Jesus, and Jews have lived in that part of the world continuously since. Many Hebrews were forc-ibly removed from that area by the 
Romans, who sent them throughout the empire against their will. Israel is the only real democracy in the Middle East, and certainly America’s only true friend. Since the creation of their state by the wisdom and agreement of countries at the United Nation, Israelis have constantly fought wars simply to survive. They are not the aggressors in the Middle East. They seek only to maintain their own small piece of land — a place that is sacred to them — and to sustain the only Jewish state in the world. 
How many Muslim countries 
are there in the world? How many Christian? How many Jewish? How is it that Palestinian terrorists — whose only goal is to destroy Israel and kill Jews — have a presumed right to land in that part of the world? How is it that Jews — who, along with their forbearers, have lived there for mil-lennia — are denied the same right? 
The Jews, in a few decades, have 
made the desert bloom with agricul-tural productivity, have maintained open religious shrines for those of every religion to enjoy and built a thriving country with blood and sweat that poured onto the des-sert sand. Should they be damned and punished for defending their tiny piece of turf — and their very survival? This is horribly unjust. 
Divestment denies history, denies Jews the right to their only homeland and in the end, denies justice itself.

your food with a spatula somehow 
speeds up the cooking process. 
My eyes frantically search for 
something to restock or some speck of dust to wipe from the stack of dishes. I turn in pathological circles like a drugged show dog until the end of this uncomfortable inter-action comes into sight. When I finally hand over your food, I’m so glad to have survived the awkward encounter that I’m almost relieved to be left in the exclusive company of cheese and onions — at least for the time being.
This is not to say that I don’t 
find you interesting. I just don’t know what to say to you, and some-times it’s best to say nothing at all, right? How do you respond when a girl tells you she wants exactly two slices of tomato and three slices of cucumber on her sandwich? I just do as she asks and send her on her way, hoping this is the worst of her obsessive compulsive disorder. 
Similarly, I never ask a certain 
customer why he wears a full busi-ness suit to every day of class. I simply submit to the fact that he will one day be a high-ranking CEO who summers in the Hamptons, while my disintegrating jeans will have earned me a cardboard box in North Park. 
And, despite my loyalties to my 
employer, I hold my tongue when I see the guy who tries to stuff an extra egg in his breakfast sandwich every morning without an extra charge. Nope — I assume that when you come into a dining hall, you want a quick bite, not advice, friendship or moral admonish-ments. So I just shut up and hand over the goods.
But when you do come to 
the counter with a smile on your face and start our exchange with a “please, ” it makes a difference. When you treat me like a fellow stu-dent, not just a lackey who serves the daily special, it makes my whole shift a little easier. And who knows, I just might be less inclined to burn your patty.

rus, which was banned by the 1980 
Geneva Convention because it creates horrific burns that continue long after contact with human flesh. 
After the 23-day Gaza siege last 
year resulted in 1,400 deaths at the hands of the Israeli military, institu-tions such as Amnesty International and the Red Cross confirmed that white phosphorous bombs were indeed used. But this does not do much to describe the daily abuses of Palestinians in the occupied territo-ries: Palestinians must endure long waits at check points, illegal searches and seizures, the demolition of their homes, “Israeli only” bypass roads, a lack of access to clean water, skyrock-eting unemployment, a wall separat-ing farmers from access to their fields and the humiliation of another nation deciding the budget on everything from schools to roads. 
Our Associated Students now have 
the opportunity to stand up against the injustice inflicted against the Palestinian people, and to demand that our university is never involved in a single bomb being dropped on a fellow human being ever again.
Many will say this resolution is 
biased — and we could not agree more. This resolution is biased for human rights, justice and equality. It is biased against bombs and military occupation. Many will also try to argue that this resolution is singling Israel out, and is therefore anti-Israel. However, this bill does not condemn one oppressive apartheid regime more than any other. If Spain were occupy-ing Palestine, then this resolution would note that Spanish occupation and seek to divest from it. 
This week Chris Cruz, chair of 
A.S. Resolution-Writing Committee On Peace and Neutrality, will publicly meet with the nine-person commit-tee to discuss whether or not the Peace and Neutrality Through UC Divestment From U.S. Corporations Profiting from Occupation resolution will remain the same.
But do not fall victim to the fiction 
that the current military policies of the state of Israel represent the Jewish identity. There are an increasing num-ber of Jewish and Israeli voices calling for an end to the occupation, including organizations such as B’Tselem, Jewish Voice for Peace, Meretz-Y achad, Gush Shalom and many others. These orga-nizations see the occupation as both morally wrong and harmful to Israeli society. These broad coalitions include Holocaust survivors, rabbis and many other people of conscience who object to the terrible indignity that is forced upon the Palestinian people by right-wing extremists in their name. 
In fact, occupation is a right-wing 
Bill Does Not Condemn Jewish Identity
▶ TASK FORCE, MYVTWHNLBarzilay: Resolution Would Promote Anti-Semitic Sentiment
Why is it that in the 21st century, as bright individuals who have been granted high education and great privileges — and at an age where everything is possible — why can’t we be more creative?
I proposed a solution to this issue. 
But before I get to that, I would like to explain how this bill, the A.S. meeting and this past week have affected me, because, so far, I have only represented my pro-Israel community rather than myself. Like every student standing in line for his or her turn at the podium, I wanted my turn.
As an Israeli citizen, I am obligated 
to serve in the Israeli Defense Force. This is a law, not a choice. Both my parents and grandparents served in the IDF, helping build the state of Israel, and my best friend currently serves as an IDF officer. The proposed resolution would have divested from a military operation that is part of my cultural and national identity. When I move to Israel after I graduate, I would like to know that my university sup-ports that decision. 
I also have the right to be safe 
when I live there, and therefore, I have the right to be defended by this mili-tary. While I understand that this may be a stretch from the intentions of the resolution to divest from weapons of war, had it been passed, the associa-tion between military spending and the IDF would have been clear. The association between “war crimes” and Israeli soldiers would have been there. Clearly, this resolution was more of a gesture than a step toward any improvements in the Middle East, and therefore, this gesture would have hurt me and my future decisions.
Secondly, the Guardian  may think 
it’s an overstatement for me and my 
pro-Israel commu-nity to feel “unsafe” had the A.S. Council passed this biased resolu-tion — but the truth holds that 
these anti-Israel sentiments across international campuses have caused much harm to student life. To single out the actions of one government has a dangerous effect, because of the asso-ciations people make with its country and its people. A UC Berkeley student was physically harassed while advocat-ing for peace in Israel, insisting on the number of times the Israeli govern-ment had made peace negotiations. After the divestment resolution debate, swastikas were found on the UC Davis and UC Berkeley campuses. When Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren was invited to speak at UC Irvine, he was booe d off the stage, intruding on 
his freedom of speech. So yes — it is a very far cry to say that my com-munity is in any way being ostracized right now. But I value my feelings very highly, and I did fear feeling unsafe on my campus had the council decided to pass this resolution. 
My hopes for the committee, which 
will meet this week to draft a unified resolution, is to stay away from divest-ment talks. Look — everyone arguing over this resolution is pro-human rights. I am pro-Palestinian in the literal sense of that phrase. I recognize the suffering of the Palestinian people, and I want to help them. Instead of divesting from one source and inher-ently blaming it for its actions, let’s invest in a cause we all care about. Let’s raise money for Palestinian hospitals and schools in Gaza. Let’s donate our time and volunteer in the region, as many alternative spring breaks do. Let’s invest in a company that will ensure all people suffering in the region will get help. Let’s travel to the region together as a unified community and see both sides of the situation. Leave General Electric out of it. If we’re already letting the A.S. Council intervene with international policy, let’s actually utilize its resources. Let’s be wiser, tougher and more open-minded than ever before this week.

▶ RESOLUTION, MYVTWHNLSo Much for Equal Protection
Not only does the Arizona State Senate’s new bill 
promote blatant racial profiling, it also dam-
ages U.S.-Mexico relations — as if vigilante border patrol and the George W . Bush-approved plan to build a fence along the southern border hadn’t already made us international villains. 
As the federal government attempts to sort out 
the civil-rights disaster that Arizona has created, one thing becomes certain: The bill hastily shoves aside any attempts to welcome diversity into Arizona’s community and spits right-wing propagandism in the face of equality. All Arizonans of Latino descent — legal citizens or not — can now be pulled aside in public places to be manhandled and humiliated by cops because of the color of their skin. 
Rather than addressing illegal immigration at 
large — which obviously concerns individuals of all ethnicities — this bill unjustly targets our neighbors south of the border. Even though the law’s fine print also allows Arizona state police to stop and question potential Canadian illegal immigrants, realistically, police won’t pull over a white civilian and ask to see his papers — even if his pronounciation of “about” is a little off. 
Though the ink is still drying on SB 1070, it is 
already under full attack and nationwide scrutiny  — which is, perhaps, the only positive result of its existence. If its publicity during the past week has worked to build resistance against this bill, maybe it can come to serve as a never-again precedent. 
—Margaret Yau
Contributing WriterArizona lawmakers recently passed the controversial immigration law SB 1070 — 
allowing police officers to demand residency documentation from anyone they “reasonably suspect” to be an illegal immigrant — has sparked national controversy. 
But, even if it is an extreme step toward the 
right wing, it does have majority opinion on its side.
An April 27 poll conducted by Angus 
Reid Public Opinion shows that seven out of 10 Americans support arresting people who can’t prove they are in the U.S. legally. Almost two-thirds of those who responded to the poll expressed that they believe illegal immigrants hurt the country by taking jobs away from American workers. 
The bill is a signal that Americans will not 
tolerate illegal immigration. And, according to Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), because the federal government has done little to help Arizona with its immigration problems, the state has been forced to take the matter into its own hands.
So, regardless of whether the legislation 
will be found unconstitutional — if not overly extreme — at least it will get the attention of the federal government, and encourage the White House to find a more levelheaded solution to our country’s enormous illegal-immigrant elephant in the room.

political platform in Israel. Many Jewish citizens oppose it. So, if some-one tells you that he is “for Israel” but only represents this side of the contro-versy, he’s not telling you the full story.
Let this resolution become the 
piece of legislation that defines our generation. Let it be known that UCSD will not go on one more day until the money that is spent toward the oppression of Palestine is not in its hands any longer. We must remember that UC students have a long history of standing up for human rights. When Nelson Mandela was let out of prison, he thanked the UC students for their relentless work in divesting from the apartheid regime in South Africa.
 We have a legacy; we have a place 
in the struggle that we cannot ignore any longer. It is time that the UC students take our rightful place in the fight for human rights. We can no longer sit idly by as our university supports the alienation and the rac-ist treatment of a group of people, no matter who they might be. Y es, it will mean an uncomfortable conver-sation about things we’ d rather not think about — but when has that ever stopped us before?Arizona could’ve been a little less obvious about the thinly veiled racism in its latest 
wave of legislation. 
After passing a bill that allows police to 
detain anyone suspected of being an illegal immigrant and making it a crime to even leave your house without proof that you’re a legal U.S. resident, you’ d think lawmakers would lay low for a while and hide, for at least a while, behind their corrupt desire for insulated state security at all costs.
But whatever credibility the law’s support-
ers may have held to their argument — that the legislation is simply a way to realistically enforce federal law — disintegrated a mere seven days after Arizona Governor Jan Brewer passed the bill. 
That’s when the state’s superintendent of pub-
lic instruction proposed a law that would ban both ethnic-studies courses and teachers with accents from English classes.
Y ou’ve got to be in serious denial to claim 
that the two measures aren’t related — not to mention outrageously racist. 
Though Brewer the bull hasn’t passed the 
education bill quite yet, it’s likely she will. And even if the bill dies, it will still send a clear mes-sage to the state’s residents: If you’re not white and completely assimilated, you should take your freedom elsewhere.

After graduating from UCSD in 2007,

Three years after graduating from UCSD, 
Muir College almunus Erik Maki owns and operates Maki Longboards. But Maki wasn’t transformed into a small-business owner in a 
UCSD economics course — rather, in a woodshop class he took his senior year at a local community college. 
As a linguistics major without a clue what to do 
come graduation, Maki decided to try his hand at woodworking at Mesa Community College during Winter Quarter 2007. 
“It started as a hobby, and the more I did it, I real-
ized that I could do something that not many others can — and it’s making other people happy, too, ” Maki said. “ At least for me, I’m an experiential learner; so tak-ing classes is one thing, but going out and experiencing the things that you’re learning have always been more important to me. So it wasn’t until I was immersed in woodworking that I started to put everything together. ”
Immediately after graduating from UCSD, Maki was 
hired by a high-end home-decor company in San Diego, where he continued to learn more about woodworking, as well as interior design. However, he said he eventu-ally became frustrated with what he considered to be his complete detachment from the creative process.
“I was working 60 hours a week at a cabinet shop,

Sixth College sophomore and editor in chief of 
the brand new No 15 magazine Kevin Nguyen is a walking fashion spread. Last Monday, he 
paired a green-brown plaid shirt and straight-cut black jeans with a nose ring, a wrist of silver spiked bracelets and a puffed ’80s pompadour. His own trend-busting addiction to style — which Nguyen says is inspired by fashion giants Lady Gaga and Alexander McQueen — motivated him to found No 15 in February.
Though No 15 isn’t the first fashion magazine 
to grace the UCSD news stands, the staff ’s self-proclaimed affinity for “raw and raunchy” style has helped it stand out as the edgiest of its kind, accord-ing to founding member and marketing director Liz Kim. Unlike Fashion Quarterly — the first UCSD publication to model itself after fashion magazines like Elle — No 15 takes on more of a minimalist approach, focusing less on product and more on people, Kim said.
“When you read Vogue or Elle, you always say, 
‘Damn, I wish I had that T-shirt’ or ‘Damn, I wish I was skinnier, ’” Nguyen said. “But we keep that real and raw aspect. We push the people more and give them empowerment. We don’t Photoshop people’s bodies and put sixpacks in. We’re showing how they really are — not some super fantasy that we decide. ”
Despite its alleged bareboned approach, A.S. Vice 
President of Finance and Resources Peter Benesch said that No 15’s $8,693.43 startup funds — used to produce and print 3,000 issue were the highest the A.S. Council has ever allocated to a publication. Associate Vice President of Student Organizations Andrew Ang explained that No 15’s higher price NO 15

It’s also vetted by a daily cascade

And it’s no wonder: Las Cuarto Milpas (literally meaning “The Four Cornfields”) has been serving the most delicious and unpretentious home-style Mexican food in San Diego for the last 70-odd years.
But good luck finding it, or a spot 
once you’re there: Milpas is the epito-me of hole-in-the-wall with free-for-all table space, bare walls (aside from some family photos and a restaurant review on one) and a menu board that looks like it was lifted from an AYSO snack bar. 
It’s safe to say that Milpas focuses 
all its energy on its food. It’s a no-bullshit kind of business, the kind where everything is either cooked on cast iron frying pans or pan-fried in a pool of lard. Since 1933, three genera-tions of the Estudillo family have been running this old-fashioned, cafeteria-
style joint just a few blocks from Chicano Park; and since 1933, customers have flooded its cramped walls during breakfast and lunch hours to enjoy the most authentic Mexican food north of the border. 
Not much has changed on the 
menu over the last seven decades. It’s an indicator that the place still prides itself on the perfected basics: Spanish rice, stewed pinto beans, tacos (rolled or soft-shell), tamales (chicken or beef) and chorizo with eggs. The latter two items are the most flavor-packed of the bunch, and by far the most recommended from Milpas’ hardcore aficionados. The only downside is that they also don’t have much beyond the basics — meaning, no salsa, guaca-mole or carné asada. But for $7 or $8, you can stuff yourself with more than enough to hold you over for the day — including the best handmade flour tortillas in San Diego. 
The whole operation does get 
a little greasy, but that’s a given in home-style territory. About half of Milpas’ patrons take their meals to go, so you can do the same, or find a place to sit somewhere in the back. Parking can also be a problem (seeing how streets in Barrio Logan are slimmer than most), so making the 20-minute caravan via carpool is your best bet; it shouldn’t be hard to find a friend will-ing to swallow something other than stir fry for lunch. And when you get there, be proud to take your place at the end of the line like so many gen-erations of hungry people before you.

money, but I was not happy at all, ” 
Maki said. “I was doing things for other people the way that they wanted, and felt that I wasn’t getting anything out of it. I decided that I was ready for something new. ”
It was after his departure from 
Beme International that Maki decided to settle down in El Segundo, combine his experience as a guide for UCSD’s Outback Adventures with his new skills as a woodworker to create Maki Longboards, a company specializing in custom wood surf and skateboards. 
Without the money to rent a 
private workspace, Maki converted the two-car garage in his El Segundo home into a 500-square-foot work-shop. Stacks of tools along the walls and planks of wood stacked every-where in between left almost no wig-gle room for creating the boards. And aside from cramped quarters, Maki faced the more classic obstacles of working in a residential area: Within a week of setting up shop, Maki’s neigh-bors had already complained to the cops about noise.
Since the rocky start, Maki has hit 
his stride. The woodworker shapes an average of four to five boards a week, priced between $150 for the 23-inch Mini Longboard to $300 for the 46-inch Classic Cruiser, each taking around three days to perfect. 
Maki first started skateboarding 
his freshman year as a way to get to class on time. As a longtime avid surf-er, he eventually envisioned that the practical act of skateboarding could take on some of the more recreational qualities of surfing. He eventually got a personal feel for the intimate experience that comes with cruising around on a longboard across campus — a central feeling to his approach in shaping his boards. 
“The more I just went from point 
A to point B and just learned how to ride, it was fun, — but that’s where eventually I wanted a board that reflected more of my personality and style, ” Maki said. “ And that’s where surfing came in. ”
Maki said he shapes his on-land 
longboards to emulate the sensation of surfing a long, slow wave — an approach he believes many larger longboard companies have abandoned in prioritizing mass production over quality.
“I guess I’m going against the grain 
because most skateboard companies 
are about making a ton of boards that they can get out there, ” Maki said. “Every board is made the same way, so the way they make them different is by add-ing colorful graphics or art. What I’m doing is kind of taking a different approach. I’m look-ing to cater to surfers who want a 
skateboard that looks as nice as their surfboard, feels like their surfboard and rides like it, too. ”
As soon as his business was off the 
ground, Maki returned to his first love and began to shape surfboards as well. His models are made of Redwood Alaia, a wood that, according to Maki, was used by ancient Hawaiians to construct surfboards long before the Western world made contact in 1778. The Alaia boards start at roughly $300 each.
The UCSD graduate said his most 
important job at Maki Longboards is creating the individual design of each board. 
“I want to be making boards with 
my own two hands that reflect the work and the thought that go into every board, and no two boards that I’ve ever made have been exactly alike, ” he said. “With the different woods I use — the colors and the grain patterns — everything is always going to be different, and that’s what’s so exciting about it. Y ou’ll get these grains that will almost give the boards a sense of movement. It’s like a skate-board that looks like a Ferrari just by the natural wood itself. ”
Locally, he has sold his boards in 
Muir Surf and Skate in Pacific Beach (formerly located in Muir College) and the Outback Adventures Surf Shop in Price Center. Although he prefers to take local orders to because it allows more customer participa-tion in the shaping process, Maki’s business is earning nationwide popu-larity. In the last year, Maki entered the world of high art by shaping boards for restaurant countertops and art galleries in Los Angeles. In addition, Maki recently received a bizarre request from a man in North Carolina who wanted a surfboard shaped for his English bulldog. According to the client, surfing is his dog’s No.1 passion in life. 
“But apparently, he hasn’t been 
able to find a board that is durable enough for her, because she spends most of her time chewing through them, ” Maki said.
Though he highly prizes the inti-
mate feel of custom handiwork, Maki is not above seeking the corporate leg-up in a highly competitive market. Though individual orders are still his main source of income, he said he recently began making prototype longboards that he hopes to sell to major skate shops, along with crafting boards specifically for home decor. But until his big break, Maki said he’s more than happy carving out a living from a pastime he loves. 
“I never know how any day is 
going to turn out, but I know that it’s going to surprise me in a good way, ” he said. I’ve always known that there was no one perfect job for me, and 
what I was going to be doing had no job title — so I’m glad that I get to make up my job title as I go. ”

The James K. Binder Lectureship in Literature 
In commemoration of the 400th year anniversary of Galileo’s telescope,
the Literature Department is pleased to present...  
MARIO BIAGIOLI 
Inventing Invention:
Galileo’s Telescope Between
Science and Craft
Galileo's name is routinely associated with the telescope, 
and vice versa.  As obvious as this link may sound today, it is in fact the result of historical narratives - narratives initiated by Galileo himself. He did not inventthe telescope but Galileo's telescope. His instrument, Galileo intimated, was different from all others because of the way it had been invented (through theory, not haphazard practice) and because of the unprecedented astronomical discoveries it made possible:  the irregularities of the lunar surface, the satellites of Jupiter, and many more fixed stars. Galileo's claim to the inventorship of the telescope was therefore tied - necessarily so - to what he presented as the unique features of his instrument and the modalities of its invention.  In the Binder Lecture, Professor Biagioli will argue that Galileo constructed his originality and that of his instruments through narratives that were themselves original, in a variety of ways.

Mario Biagioli  is Professor of the 
History of Science at Harvard University. 
His work has focused mostly on the place 
of science and discovery in the baroque 
court, and the uses of instruments, 
imaging techniques, and the tactical uses 
of print, spectacle, and display in the 
making of knowledge Galileo Courtier 
(Chicago, 1993 - translated in German, 
Greek, Spanish, and Portuguese) and 
Galileo's Instruments of Credit (Chicago, 
2006)). Along with a standing interest in 
the scientific revolution, he has also 
explored more modern topics, like Nazi 
science, science museums, as well as 
methodological debates concerning 
science studies and their relationship 
with the humanities additional research 
focused on the history and philosophy of 
intellectual property and on the author 
function in science from 1600 to "big 
science." He is now working on Claiming 
the New - a book on intellectual property 
in science. He is also the editor of The 
Science Studies Reader (Routledge, 1998), 
and (with Jessica Riskin) of Nature 
Engaged (Palgrave/McMillan, in press). 
Prior to joining Harvard in 1995, Biagioli 
was a member of the history department 
at UCLA and co-director of the Center for 
Cultural Studies of Science, Technology, 
and Medicine. He has been a visiting 
professor at Stanford, the Ecole des

Kim said that No15’s first issue 
is slated to hit racks this Friday — delayed from its original May 1 launch-party release due to the printing company’s inability to print the issue the Friday prior. To spare the 3,000 glossy copies from weather damage, the issues will only be placed in locales with indoor news racks such as Cafe Roma, Price Center and the Loft. In addition, she said that all con-tributors, models and launch-party attendees will receive a copy of the magazine, and spares will be set aside for archives. 
According to Nguyen, No 15’s 
articles on various student fashion designers emphasize the artists’ inspirations and goals, rather than their physical work. No 15 will primarily feature undergraduate photographers and models, with an occasional cameo photo shoot by a professional volunteer. Their debut issue will host a student-modeled photo essay entitled “We the People, ” a homage to the varied fashion sense of students at UCSD.
“We wanted some self-expres-
sion: people who aren’t afraid to be who they are, ” Nguyen said. “So we study people. We talk to them, see what they’re like and try to capture everyone’s essence. [During the photoshoots], we have them give directional and creative input, so it’s about them. ”
According to Kim, the magazine 
endeavors to push boundaries — just like the Federalist Papers 15, which invited Americans in the 1700s to question the Articles of Confederation, and authority in general.
“No 15 [of the Federalist Papers] 
was an attempt to open people’s minds — a breaking away, ” Kim said. “We’re not breaking away from the fashion industry, but we’re making people more aware. It also happened to coincide with the cam-
pus’s recent racial climate. I think [that] rebellious spirit is captured in our magazine. ”
There’s no doubt about it: No 
15 is shooting for shock and awe. Nestled between fashion-designer profiles and question-and-answer sessions with nonprofit shoe com-pany TOMS Shoes are full spreads of food porn — gourmet food served on nude bodies — and women with their breasts on full display. But for the editors of No 15, the controversy these risque photos might stir on campus is a progressive foray into the real world.
“I feel like [UCSD students] are 
really isolated and protected, ” Kim said. “We live in this bubble. We want people to go out and see more naked people, see things, I don’t know. Pop that bubble, get out of your comfort zone and see what more is out there. ”

trying to focus on our skills to help prepare us for regionals. ”
The Tritons traveled to 
Northridge for their penultimate game of the season, at which they lost every singles and doubles match. Three Triton singles players lost in straight sets: junior Taskeen Bains fell 6-2, 6-1; senior Anita Athavale fell 6-3, 6-2; and freshman Melissa Breisacher fell 6-2, 6-1. Sophomore Samantha Y eung took a set off of her opponent, but still fell in a decisive third set to lose 6-3, 2-6, 6-2.
The doubles teams fared no bet-
ter against the elite D-I competition.  The dependable tandem of Athavale and Breisacher lost 8-4. Bains and junior Natalie Varnay paired up to little avail, losing 8-4 and the team of Y eung and junior Cindy Dao lost 8-1. 
After its crushing loss to the 
Matadors, UCSD returned home and traveled across town to face local rivals SDSU — ranked No. 75 at the national level.
“San Diego State is a really strong 
school, ” La Plante said. “We knew that we probably weren’t going to beat them. It was just fun to play a local San Diego team and give the girls some tough competi-tion so they stay focused after the Conference Championships. ”
The Aztecs made their superior-
ity known, sweeping all the matches for a comprehensive 7-0 victory. 
The Triton’s junior Valerie Tang 
— who wasn’t even on the starting roster against Cal State Northridge — played the most competitive match of the day, but still lost 6-4, 6-3. 
Y eung agreed with LaPlante that 
the tough D-I competition was valu-able in preparation for playoffs. 
“Division-I is definitely a lot 
tougher, but we had a lot of close matches, ” Y eung said. “We know that both teams, CSUN and SDSU, are beatable. We feel ready to face the rest of our Division-II competition heading into the postseason. ”
UCSD will travel to Hawaii the 
week of May 6 to open up the west-ern regional against postseason nemesis Hawaii Pacific University. Last year, the Tritons managed a 5-4 victory over the Sea Warriors during the regular season, only to be eliminated by them in the regional playoffs with a score of 5-3. The Tritons will enter their May 6 encounter against Hawaii Pacific motivated by retribution, hoping to reverse their losing trend against the Sea Warriors who beat UCSD 5-4 in a closely contested matchup on March 25.
Y eung said the Tritons are pre-
paring rigorously for the challenge, and remain confident they can exact revenge on the team that has repeat-edly foiled their national title plans.
“We are getting better prepared 
to go to Hawaii, and hopefully 
nationals after that, ” Y eung said. “We are hydrating more, staying more focused the night before and trying to get better mentally pre-pared. ” 
In calculating a tactical approach 
against Hawaii Pacific, LaPlante said she is urging the girls to focus on the individual players they will be facing.
While the players focus on 
mental and physical preparation, LaPlante is calculating the tactical approach the team will adopt against Hawaii Pacific, and said she is trying to focus the girls’ attention to their individual matchups.
“ N o w  t h a t  i t  i s  t h e  p o s t s e a s o n ,  
we are trying to get more specific with the teams we are going to face, ” LaPlante said. “Especially with the doubles, we are trying to cater our formations to help us against the competition as we move ahead. ”

The UCSD women’s tennis team will open up the postseason against Hawaii Pacific University 
on May 6. The Sea Warriors beat the Tritons earlier in the season by a narrow 5-4 margin.
students. Reducing scholarships 
is obviously never a good thing — 
especially in financially challenging times. But even worse, eliminating the Competitive Cal Grant dispropor-tionately affects community-college students by reducing the number of recipients by 45 percent, as opposed to 16 percent within the UC system. 
Attending community college 
costs approximately $4,500 each year — a much more accessible alternative to a CSU or UC campus. Community colleges provide an invaluable local gateway to higher education — one that, unprotected by the governor’s Tax Day promise, will now be further jeopardized. 
According to the governor’s plan, 
restoring funding to higher-education institutions will require the Cal Grant program be frozen in its current state. In the past, Competitive Cal Grant payments have increased alongside fee increases. From the 2009-10 aca-demic year to the 2010-11 academic year, the 32-percent increase in stu-dent fees leaves a $3,000 gap that stu-dents will have to cover without the help of Cal Grants. 
While Gov. Schwarzenegger may 
have promised no more future cuts to the other parts of the Cal Grant sys-tem last week, maintaining a fixed rate of aid in full knowledge that tuition will rise each year is essentially undo-ing the promise.
We understand that California’s 
budget isn’t an endless well of funds, but guaranteeing money to top public institutions while cutting from the Cal Grant system will discourage upward mobility — disproportion-ately affecting those populations who need the opportunity most. In this way, California will be taking a more privatized and lopsided approach to education.
According to the Public Policy 
Institute of California, by 2025, California will have one million fewer college-educated residents than the economy requires. 
To preserve equal access to higher 
education, California needs a more sustainable plan. Like it or not, voters need to start investing in higher edu-cation through their taxes. We need to reconsider Proposition 13, which freezes property taxes at 1 percent — and which, as a result, has diminished state funding for higher education. After the measure passed in 1973, 
tuition and stu-dent fees have steadily risen. It’s clearly not possible to keep property-tax revenues at a static 1 percent and simultaneously preserve qual-ity, accessible higher educa-tion in a failing economy.
Another 
way to close the gaping hole left by the Governor’s 
proposal could be to join state grants with non-profit scholarships. Instead of remaining isolated in the depths of the Internet, non-profit organizations’ scholarships could be made available alongside state grants, garnering pub-licity while simultaneously ensuring low-income students aren’t left out in the rain without an umbrella. 
While the governor’s refusal to sign 
the budget until more funds have been allocated to California’s public higher-education system is admirable, pre-serving a stable middle class and com-petitive working force is going to take a lot more than optimistic rhetoric and a stingy signature for the dotted line.

out of this one without spitting out at 
least some revealing secrets. That whole “Those lowly humans couldn’t possibly know what I’m thinking” act? It’s up.
On June 12, 2010, when Group 
C of the 2010 FIFA World Cup kicks off at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg, South Africa, before a scrutinizing world audience, you will have two options to choose from: save the queen or bless America. BOOM! Bet you didn’t see that one coming! 
But in all seriousness — lame his-
torical references aside — the world will be keenly watching Group C when the United Kingdom, in all its regal glory, faces the U.S., its defiant former colony. It’s the kind of mouth-watering, politically charged showdown that only the World Cup can facilitate.
Considering that America leads 
the world in tickets purchased per country, and that Britain takes a close third (according to FIFA sales data from last February), packs of fans from both countries will descend upon Rustenburg to cheer on their teams in a football-pitch reenactment of the Revolutionary W ar. And, just like the first time around, the British are the heavy favorite. If the Americans are to upset the Three Lions, it will take a Y ankee performance of epic, odds-defy-ing proportions. Before you overzealous American patriots let your delusions go any further, let me serve you a harsh does of reality: The British will finish atop Group C.
The Three Lions enter this year’s 
World Cup highly motivated. Their shocking failure to qualify for the 2008 European Championships was a deep embarrassment for the country — espe-cially since the British press had hyped the team as one of the more talented crops of players England has ever fea-tured. However, the hiring of legend-ary Italian tactician Fabio Capello has promptly turned their fortunes around, distancing the painful memories of 2008.Capello — known as a strict, pater-
nalistic, authoritative figure — immedi-ately instilled a sense of discipline into a team that, though loaded with world-class talent, lacked cohesion, consis-tency and a winning mentality. In 2009, England breezed through European qualifications, exacting revenge against Croatia, who ended their Euro 2008 qualification campaign a year earlier.
With a roster littered in talis-
manic superstars — midfielders Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard and for-ward Wayne Rooney, to name a few — England stands as one of my top three favorites to win the entire tournament. However, an unimpressive selection of goalkeepers, injuries to key role play-ers, locker-room stability and a horrific history in penalty shoot-outs stand to derail their World Cup campaign. Nonetheless, the English are heavy favorites for the semifinals; at the very least.
The Bald Eagles, led by head 
coach Bob Bradley, will likely finish as runners-up to Capello’s men —enough to qualify for the round of sixteen. I have always been highly critical of U.S. soccer — maybe overly critical. In past years, I might have even picked Slovenia or Algeria to advance. I’ve never understood how our country, capable of producing internation-ally acclaimed talents in seemingly all sports but soccer, has historically faltered to field a team whose techni-cal ability matches its athleticism, and constantly lost to teams with less physi-cally imposing, more gifted players. For this reason, I never thought of Landon Donovan as anything more than a mediocre player, hyped simply because he was American.
However, over the last year, I have 
been forced to eat my words. Donovan’s impressive performance in England playing for local Liverpool-based club Everton FC with and against the world’s best talents has dispelled all the previ-ous criticisms — of his arrogance, overstated abilities and cowardice for not testing himself in the high-level European leagues —I had levied against him. Donovan and Clint Dempsey, who plays for London-based club Fulham, have both established themselves as useful, quality players at the highest level. Moreover, the increasing influx of talented Americans into the various European leagues has had noticeable effects on the entire national team: players now compete with the belief that they can hold their own with the best of the best.
Perhaps no better an illustration of 
the U.S. transformation was its improb-able run to the 2009 Confederations Cup Final, during which it beat a com-petent Egyptian team, scored a historic upset over current No. 1 in the world Spain and barely lost 3-2 to eventual champs Brazil after taking a shocking 2-0 lead in the final.
While recent American achieve-
ments have certainly raised expecta-tions, they may set the team up to flop, should they fail to scale such unexpect-ed heights again.
While the England and the U.S. 
are the clear headliners of this group, and deservedly so, both teams would be foolish to pay as little attention to Slovenia and Algeria as I have in this column. Led by Dutch master tacti-cian Guus Hiddink, a coach whose credentials are unquestionably master-ful, the Slovenians beat out a talented, heavily favored Russian team (who had made the semifinals of the European Championships under Hiddink’s guid-ance only one year prior). Algeria also qualified by scoring a surprise upset against an able-bodied Egyptian team, which had just won the African Cup of Nations. While both teams boast fewer quality players than the English or Americans, every four years, the World Cup stage proves heart can trump tal-ent — and if the unpredictable does occur, it wouldn’t be the first time people would be justified in calling the Brits and their rebellious offspring arrogant.were forced to return the practice courts without any in-match train-ing against the Highlanders.
Despite being 
denied valuable late-season match-play experience, junior captain Vince Nguyen said the team managed to make produc-tive use of the newly-inherited, extra practice time.
“[The weath-
er] cleared up in San Diego, so we went to practice, ” Nguyen said. “We did a lot of con-ditioning and pre-pared for our sin-gles and doubles. ”
With under a week before 
the Tritons depart for Hawaii, 
Nguyen said the team has a spe-cial plan for getting into the right 
mentality heading into the post season.
“We’re planning 
o n  h a v i n g  a n  i n t e r -squad match … and that usually gets us fired up because we’re playing each other, ” Nguyen said. “We trash-talk each other and try to get everyone fired up to go to Hawaii. ”
The Tritons 
will face the No. 2 Seasiders, who fin-ished with an 18-3 regular season record, in the NCAA Western Regional on May 6 in Laie, Hawaii.

Having sealed the conference title 
with their rousing 6-3 victory over Cal State Stanislaus on April 
17, the women’s tennis team suffered a hangover against Division-I opponents Cal State Northridge on April 24 and San Diego State on April 26; UCSD lost both matches 7-0.
Despite the team’s end of the season 
losses, head coach Liz LaPlante said the challenging matches were useful in pre-paring for the postseason race for the regional and national titles, which begin May 6.  UCSD needs two victories on the Hawaiian Islands to claim a spot in 16-team Division-II National Championship brack-et. The Tritons must first navigate their match against Hawaii Pacific University, a squad that has knocked the Tritons out of the playoffs two of the past three seasons.  
With a win, the Tritons would face 
the winner of a matchup between BYU-Hawaii and California Collegiate Athletic Association foe Cal State Stanislaus.   The Seasiders shutout the Tritons 9-0 on March 24 while UCSD tallied a pair of victories against the Warriors during the regular season.
While history doesn’t side with the 
Tritons making Nationals — schools from the Hawaiian Islands have knocked UCSD out of the playoffs for four straight years — LaPlante believes the D-I competition was good preparation for the playoffs.  
“Every year, I try and schedule some 
good teams to play between conference and regionals, ” LaPlante said. “ A lot of times, they wind up being good Division-I schools that are tough to beat. We just 5*((>,:;,959,.06579,=0,>
UCSD TO FACE BYU-HAWAII FOR THIRD TIME
By Tyler Nelson
Senior Staff Writer
MEN’S TENNIS — Having concluded the regular season with a 12-10 overall record and the No. 30 Division-II national ranking, the Tritons had postured themselves for a top-four finish in the Western Region — a requisite for postseason qualification — and looked likely to secure their eleventh straight NCAA Divison-II postseason bid.
According to the Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s 
end-of-season poll, UCSD finished the year No. 3 in the region — behind Brigham Y oung University – Hawaii and Hawaii Pacific University — and faced a 
potential encounter with No. 2 seed BYU – Hawaii.
However, any definitive strides towards postseason 
play for the Tritons hinged on the NCAA Selection 
Committee’s April 28 announcement of the region’s official seeds, at which point the Tritons’ postseason opponents would be revealed.
Prior to the announcement, Nguyen said the team 
was focusing more on their improving their own game than worrying about their potential opponents.
“We just have to get everyone prepared to play, and 
we really aren’t expecting anything weird to happen, ” Nguyen said.
On April 28, speculation was confirmed, as UCSD 
was paired against BYU-Hawaii in the No. 2 vs. No. 3 seed match up. The meeting will mark the third time this year the squads will lock horns, and the Tritons will hope to reverse their losing fortunes against their Hawaiian counterparts. On Feb. 12, the Tritons fell 5-4 to the Seasiders at the Paseo Tournament, and lost 7-2 on March 24 in Laie, Hawaii.
However, UCSD will be buoyed by past postseason 
success against BYU-Hawaii, whom they swept 5-0 in the West Regional in 2008. Nguyen added that the Tritons are much improved since the last time the two teams crossed paths. 
“We’ve improved since then, but so have they, ” 
Nguyen said. “This will be a different match, and anything can happen on any given day. We are just going to control what we can and hope that everyone 
performs well that day. ”
The UCSD men’s tennis team had hoped to use 
their season-ending April 21 road match against 
Division-I, non-conference opponent UC Riverside as a chance to perfect their form and technique heading into playoffs. That chance never materialized.
The match, originally scheduled to take place in 
February, was postponed due to rainy conditions and rescheduled for late April as a prelude to the postseason for both squads. However, the Tritons 
again saw foul weather upset their final match, and

Hawaii Pacific University
The Tritons will open up the west-
ern regional against Hawaii Pacific University, a familiar postseason opponent for UCSD. The Sea Warriors have eliminated the Tritons from 
the playoffs two of the past three 
seasons. During the regular 
season, HPU earned a narrow 
5-4 victory over UCSD. The Tritons only beat the Sea Warriors twice in their last 
eight meetings.
CSU Stanislaus
As a California Collegiate Athletic Association foe, the Tritons have recorded a pair of victories over the Warriors this season. The grandest of those victories came on April 17, 
when UCSD earned a convincing 
6-3 win over CSUS to claim 
the conference title for the seventh straight season. The 
Tritons are 4-0 against the 
Warriors after the past two 
seasons.BYU - Hawaii
BYU-Hawaii dominated UCSD in the two teams’ regular-season matchup, blanking the Tritons 9-0 on March 24. The Seasiders are the top-ranked team in Division-II, with a 28-0 overall record. The two teams have only met 
twice in the past three years, 
and BYU-Hawaii claimed 
victories in both. One of 
those victories knocked UCSD out of the western 
region in 2008.
