Annabeth Chase is Black
By LAILA DEL RIO 
/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019RACEBENDING
When recasting classic roles 
with POC actors leads to backlash, 
what happens then? 
I have been a fan of Percy Jack -
son since I was a little kid. So, when 
the new series on Disney+ was an -
nounced I was quite excited. Not 
only was Rick Riordan thoroughly 
involved in the production, but we 
were going to be getting a whole 
new cast to embody the characters 
I had fallen in love with growing 
up. /T_here is just something special 
about watching a cast of charac -
ters grow up alongside you. Percy 
Jackson’s story starts at 12 years 
old, which means that readers and 
now viewers get to grow up with 
him once again. Rick Riordan 
even worked closely with Disney 
for about a year through the exten -
sive process to /f_ind the best actors 
for our main trio. 
/T_he casting announcements 
came in waves. We were /f_irst in -
troduced to Walker Scobell as 
our Percy Jackson. Audiences 
awaited the announcement of 
Grover and Annabeth with bated 
breath. Aryan Simhadri and Leah 
Jeﬀeries were announced as Gro -
ver and Annabeth Chase, respec -
tively. /T_hese two casting decisions 
came with far more animosity 
than Percy’s casting, due to the 
fact that these actors aren’t white. 
/T_here were complaints that Leah 
Jeﬀeries wasn’t blonde and Anna -
beth Chase had to be blonde due 
to the way the character subverts 
the “dumb blonde” stereotype to 
be taken seriously throughout 
the series. Her characterization as 
an underdog is something many 
readers relate to and is an inte -
gral part of her character. Jeﬀer -
ies wasn’t how readers pictured 
the character, which meant that 
she was automatically wrong for 
the role. However, this couldn’t be 
further from the truth. Annabeth 
Chase is a strong, brilliant power -
house of a character and I have no 
doubt that Leah Jeﬀeries will do 
a wonderful job. Being underes -
timated is no doubt an important 
piece of Annabeth’s character. As 
the controversy has proved, being 
underestimated is something that 
Leah Jeﬀeries has no issue relat -
ing with. I imagine this blowback 
will only serve to fuel her perfor -
mance. 
Rick Riordan took it upon 
himself to write a special blog 
post reiterating that Jeﬀeries was 
handpicked to play the role and 
happens to be perfect for it. He 
goes into detail and discusses the 
attributes that Jeﬀeries displays 
that make her perfect for the role. ACADEMIC AFFAIRS
Students Express Outrage Following Fallout from Lec -
turer’s Racist Comments
By Isaiah Irizarry /gid00020/gid00006/gid00015/gid00010/gid00016/gid00019/gid00001/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
On Oct. 14, a widely circulated video showing 
Lecturer Robert Ternansky making multiple racist 
comments against Latinx people in class was posted 
on social media. Now, the School of Physical Sciences 
plans to temporarily replace Ternansky for the quar -
ter as lecturer of the CHEM 41A and CHEM 143C 
courses. 
/T_he department announced on Oct. 19 that Pa -
trycja Hopkins will teach the two courses for the re -
mainder of the quarter. 
/T_he video in question, shows Ternansky during 
his Oct. 11 lecture going into the hallway to speak 
with Spanish-speaking staﬀ, shouting “Ándale, Ar -
riba!” before asking students “how to say be quiet in 
Mexican,” then telling them he “doesn’t want [the 
staﬀ] in here with their weapons.” Seventh College 
sophomore Alfonso Lazo-Cazares posted the video 
to his Instagram where it has since been viewed more 
than 240,000 times as of Oct. 21. 
“I saw the video a/f_ter my roommate showed me 
the recording,” Cazares said to /T_he UCSD Guardian. 
Linking the incident to his personal experiences, he 
added, “I have personally worked in tree service [and] 
landscaping before and know exactly what it feels like 
when someone in power makes ignorant racist re -
marks. Having gone through this has felt degrading 
and dehumanizing for both my family and I.” 
Seventh College sophomore Julian Reinhart 
showed Cazares the recording. Reinhart is a student 
in Ternansky’s CHEM 41A course and, while not 
originally physically present, he heard Ternansky’s 
remarks while watching the video recording of the 
lecture. 
“I was baﬄed, like, it just kept going,” Reinhart 
said. “He just kept saying, like random words in 
Spanish … that’s just textbook, the most disrespect -
ful thing you could say to someone, just shouting 
randomly at them. And then he says I can’t even 
speak Mexican, which isn’t even a language.” 
Reinhart and Cazares were both happy to see that 
the video of Ternansky’s comments garnered a wide 
reception. 
“We knew it was going to get a lot of attention, 
but it was better that way. It forced [the school] to act, 
rather than handling it internally,” Reinhart said.
According to Reinhart, the “weapons” comment 
upset him the most. “What is [Ternansky] insinuat -
ing here? /T_hat they’re dangerous people? I was like, 
what?” Cazares noted that this was another example 
of “negative comments and assumptions made about our beautiful Latinx people.” 
In a Canvas message to the class, Ternansky apol -
ogized to the students for his statements and vowed 
to apologize to the individuals he insulted. For Re -
inhart, that apology was insuﬃcient, and wasn’t an 
expression of remorse or guilt. 
“Even his apology has multiple typos. Like, does 
he even care? I don’t think so,” Reinhart said.
/T_his sentiment of confusion, bewilderment, and 
outrage was echoed in the testimonies collected by 
/T_hurgood Marshall senior and Vice President of 
Academic Aﬀairs Rhianen Callahan, who expressed 
their own personal outrage when /f_irst watching the 
clip. 
“I was genuinely like, ‘what the [f---]?!’ Instantly, 
you can feel the air being taken out of the room and, 
suddenly you can feel students’ [discomfort]; you can 
see the disrespect towards the staﬀ or students that 
he was talking to,” Callahan said.
Callahan /f_irst solicited testimonials on the Of -
/f_ice of VP Academic Aﬀairs’ Instagram, where they 
said that they “would not let this get swept under the 
rug,” referring to an incident last year where faculty 
resigned from an executive committee in protest of 
Professor of Anthropology Dr. Sabai Varma’s unethi -
cal research. “So far I’ve received 85 responses, which 
I’m going to consider a win,” Callahan said. “I know 
it’s very small [relative] to thousands of students on 
campus, but it’s something.” 
/T_he testimonies accounted for both incidents 
with Professor Ternansky and incidents of racism 
on campus in general. Callahan said that 29 of the 
replies were from students who had or will have a 
class taught by Ternansky, many of whom “weren’t 
surprised” by his conduct. 
According to Callahan, a student testi/f_ied that 
“[Ternansky] said early in the class, ‘if you’re eas -
ily oﬀended, this class isn’t for you,”’ while another 
accused Ternansky of sexism toward his female stu -
dents. /T_he latter testimony said that “the environ -
ment has been exclusionary ... the way that [Ternan -
sky] interacts with women is an example of this. He 
is rudely short and o/f_ten even hostile for no good 
reason, but when similar questions are asked by male 
students, however, he seems to be more able to en -
gage and answer them.”  
Other testimonials noted that Ternansky seemed 
rude and cold, a sentiment that Reinhart corrobo -
rated.

“He is just an insensitive per -
son, there’s no accommodation 
for the work, and if you ask, you’re 
just lazy … It rubs me the wrong 
way,” Reinhart said.  “And so I 
wasn’t surprised. I don’t think he 
really thinks very highly of any -
one in general.” 
Callahan noted that among 
the student responses, ideas on 
how the university should handle 
the situation with Ternansky go -
ing forward are mixed. “Some 
believe he should be /f_ired, some 
don’t, but almost all of them 
think some action needs to be 
taken,” they said. 
Reinhart thought that the ap -
propriate action would be Ter -
nansky’s termination. 
“First oﬀ, I wouldn’t feel bad 
for him, he already got his bag with Big Pharma,” referring to 
Ternansky’s previous work with 
pharmaceutical companies. Re -
inhart elaborated that if the uni -
versity really wants to show that 
they take [diversity seriously] I 
think they should [/f_ire him]. Be -
cause it was so egregious. I mean, 
it wasn’t just like one little thing. 
It was like three strikes and they 
were all pretty bad.” 
When asked for their personal 
opinions on the matter, Callahan 
also called for Ternansky to be 
/f_ired. /T_hey emphasized that such 
a situation could be incredibly 
damaging to students’ learning 
and that a faculty member with 
racist and discriminatory views 
could harm their students’ career.
“Students already have to 
worry about that stupid power dynamic of having someone who 
can instantly crush your dreams, 
or give you a bad review, or not 
support you and your cause, or 
ask a student ‘Why are you here? 
You don’t deserve to be here.’ And 
to see that up front in front of ev -
eryone is absolutely uncalled for 
and should not happen,” Calla -
han said. 
As vice president of academic 
aﬀairs, Callahan works with the 
Academic Senate and is the only 
student representative among the 
Senate’s faculty and administra -
tive staﬀ. /T_hey hope to share the 
testimonials with the faculty Sen -
ate in an eﬀort to make a change 
and get administrators to do more 
to address racism on campus. 
“I will do everything in my 
power to ensure this comes to 
light,” Callahan said, referring to 
the content of the testimonials. 
Callahan also called for greater 
student representation in the Ac -
ademic Senate, “While I’m thank -
ful for this position, and while I’m 
very passionate about doing it, I 
also recognize that I’m one per -
son, and it shouldn’t just be one 
person in general.” 
/T_he UCSD Guardian contact -
ed the university administration 
concerning the incident but was 
directed to UCSD’s oﬃcial state -
ment. In an email sent to chem -
istry students, School of Physical 
Sciences Dean Steven E. Boggs 
stated that, per university policy, 
“any further action involving this 
instructor would not be made 
public, as personnel matters are 
con/f_idential.”

Pneumonia-Fighting Microbots Developed by UC San Diego         
Researchers
BY ABBY LEE
/gid00020/gid00006/gid00015/gid00010/gid00016/gid00019/gid00001/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
Researchers at UC San Di -
ego have developed microscopic 
robots, otherwise known as mi -
crobots, to deliver antibiotics to 
treat potentially life-threatening 
pneumonia. /T_hese swimming 
hybrid microbots consist of tiny 
particles, also known as nanopar -
ticles, attached to microalgae. Mi -
croalgae, miniscule single-celled 
organisms that thrive in aqueous 
environments, give the microro -
bots the ability to move, allowing 
the microrobots to carry their at -
tached nanoparticles more deeply 
into lung tissue. /T_he nanopar -
ticles, located on the surface of 
the microalgae, are coated with 
neutrophil membrane, a type of 
white blood cell, and contain an -
tibiotics to be delivered to the site 
of infection. Researchers have found these 
microrobots to be highly eﬀec -
tive in clearing acute pneumonia. 
/T_hey infected mice with bacte -
ria “Pseudomonas aeruginosa,” 
which causes a type of antibiotic-
resistant pneumonia common in 
hospitalized individuals. Mice 
treated with the microrobots 
survived for more than a month, 
while untreated mice died within 
three days. Importantly, these 
microrobots cause negligible tox -
icity to the treated mice as well. 
Furthermore, researchers found 
that the microrobots were more 
eﬀective than antibiotics deliv -
ered through a vein. Speci/f_ically, a 
dose of microbots delivered 3,000 
times more eﬀective antibiotics 
than an equivalent dose of inject -
ed antibiotics.
In addition to being highly ef -
fective at eliminating infection, 
these microrobots are also excel -
lent at avoiding attacks and elimi -
nation from the body’s immune system, which allows them to re -
main in lung tissue for longer pe -
riods of time for continued drug 
delivery. /T_he microrobots are also 
shown to move quickly, at greater 
than110 micrometers per second), 
and are distributed uniformly 
throughout deep lung tissue.To -
gether, these /f_indings underscore 
the promising potential of micro -
robots for the direct delivery of 
therapeutics to the lungs.
/T_he work is a collaboration be -
tween the labs of nanoengineer -
ing professors Joseph Wang and 
Liangfang Zhang at the UCSD 
Jacobs School of Engineering. /T_he 
Wang lab aims to integrate nano -
materials and biomaterials with 
electronic transducers in innova -
tive ways to improve health and 
patient outcomes. Previous proj -
ects the Wang lab has led include 
nanomachines designed to isolate 
cancer cells, as well as wearable 
biosensors that monitor blood 
pressure. /T_he Zhang lab focuses on developing biomimetic nano -
technologies to tackle complex 
human diseases. Past projects 
the Zhang lab have developed in -
clude “nanosponges” that bind to 
various viruses to prevent them 
from infecting host cells, as well 
as nanocarriers as a platform for 
safer and more eﬀective vaccine 
development.
In a press release, Zhang 
explained how their work was 
particularly meaningful, given 
the diﬃculty of targeted drug 
delivery to the lungs. /T_he Wang 
and Zhang labs have previously 
worked on microrobots to treat 
bacterial infections in the stom -
ach and blood. 
“Our goal is to do targeted 
drug delivery into more chal -
lenging parts of the body, like the 
lungs,” Zhang said. “And we want 
to do it in a way that is safe, easy, 
biocompatible, and long lasting. 
/T_hat is what we’ve demonstrated 
in this work.” Wang also expressed his opti -
mism about their /f_indings. 
“/T_hese results show how tar -
geted drug delivery combined 
with active movement from the 
microalgae improves therapeutic 
eﬃcacy,” Wang said. 
/T_he researchers’ next steps in -
clude investigating more deeply 
how the microrobots interact 
with the immune system as well 
as continued experiments to con -
/f_irm their /f_indings before scaling 
the microrobots for testing in 
larger animal models, and even -
tually, for clinical applications in 
humans. 
“We’re pushing the boundary 
further in the /f_ield of targeted 
drug delivery,” Zhang said. 
/T_he researchers’ /f_indings have 
been published in Nature Materi -
als as a paper titled: “Nanoparti -
cle-modi/f_ied microrobots for in 
vivo antibiotic delivery to treat 
acute bacterial pneumonia.”5RIDES ON DEMANDA.S. Safe Rides X Lyft

Moments in history /f_lashed 
through my mind like scenes of 
a movie as I /f_irst witnessed the 
disturbing Instagram post. You 
know the one. If not, I’m referring 
to the video that captured a white 
UC San Diego lecturer spewing 
hate in the form of casual jokes 
towards two custodial work -
ers reportedly speaking Spanish 
outside of his classroom. Robert 
Ternansky asks his class, with full 
con/f_idence, how to say be quiet in 
“Mexican.” A/f_ter receiving laughs 
from his audience, he ends his 
racist remarks with, “let me know 
if they start running in here with 
their weapons. ” 
His words are a reminder of 
the very painful past endured 
by the Latinx diaspora within 
the American empire. /T_here is a 
tradition of the dehumanization, 
organized abandonment, exclu -
sion, and subjugation of Latinx 
people by the bene/f_iciaries of 
settler colonialism and the sys -
tems designed to protect it. /T_his 
is a phenomenon all too famil -
iar to the survivors of this his -
tory — myself included. Racism 
is a force that serves the interest 
of a very few wealthy individuals 
whose extractive and exploitative 
capitalist tyranny is destroying 
our planet. Racism keeps the 
masses divided, distracted, and 
in constant fear of our neighbors. 
Where there is division, there can 
be no consensus, healing, or pro -
gression towards change that may 
spring our society toward a more 
just future. /T_his is a project grow -
ing more urgent in the face of 
growing economic disparity and 
climate catastrophe. Episodes like 
the racist organic chemistry pro -
fessor can be generative in that 
they force us all to confront the 
ruptures among us, as well as the diﬃcult history that can help us 
explain them.
History proves that the atti -
tudes of the masses have real so -
cial implications. /T_he pattern of 
dehumanizing Latinx people as 
a way to justify violence against 
them begins with the conquest of 
present-day Latin America. /T_he 
Spanish-funded expedition led 
by Cristóbal Colón resulted in the 
massacre of Indigenous peoples 
and the demolition of entire eco -
systems as settler colonialism dis -
rupted natural balances between 
Indigenous stewardship and their 
land. Yet, this genocidal behavior 
was rationalized with language 
that cast Indigenous people as 
savage, docile, and non-human 
beings incapable of governing 
themselves or responsibly stew -
arding their land.
/T_his rhetoric went on to fuel 
many of the U.S. Government’s 
covert operations that overthrew 
democratically-elected le/f_tist 
leaders and movements in places 
like Guatemala, Nicaragua, Hon -
duras, and El Salvador, to name 
a few. /T_he U.S. government’s for -
eign policy re/f_lected a conviction 
around the incompetence of the 
citizens of these nations to exer -
cise their own sovereignty and 
democracy. /T_he implications? 
Decades of bloody civil wars and 
US-backed dictatorships in these 
regions. Go ahead, fact-check me. 
Fast forward to the streets of 
Los Angeles in the mid 20th cen -
tury–a time when the police were 
battering and bruising Chicanx, 
despite being dra/f_ted and dying 
disproportionately overseas for 
the war eﬀort. An increase in ur -
banization during this era led to 
racial tensions that were exacer -
bated by L.A. news media con -
sistently using young Chicanx as 
scapegoats for rising crime. /T_he 
testimony of the L.A. Police Chief 
during a very famous court case 
highlights these beliefs. He de -scribed Mexican youth as distinct 
and dangerous due to their “de -
sire to use a knife or some lethal 
weapon” as a result of being de -
scended from the “bloodthirsty 
Aztecs. ” Sounds familiar, right? 
/T_hese beliefs led to the eruption 
of violence in L.A. against Mexi -
can youth by military servicemen 
stationed in San Diego. On June 
3, 1943, determined to “teach the 
greasers a lesson, ” a small army 
of mostly sailors and marines 
took to the barrios of L.A. with 
weapons, brutalizing any young 
person perceivably Latinx. /T_his 
series of events is collectively re -
membered as the Zoot Suit Riots. 
With police turning a blind eye, 
this violence went on for days and 
spread across American cities.
In 2016, Donald Trump’s lan -
guage describing migrants from 
Central America as “bringing 
drugs, bringing crime, ” and “rap -
ists” eﬀectively distracted the 
masses from the reality of the 
situation. /T_he southern borders 
are overwhelmed by political ref -
ugees, most of whom are women 
and children from the Caribbean 
and Central America seeking 
asylum from violence and threats 
to their physical safety. 
/T_he examples are endless. /T_he 
point is: narratives matter. Hate -
ful, xenophobic, and racist ste -
reotypes set the preconditions for 
violence. When we call out this 
kind of language, we do so in the 
interest of saving lives, not simply 
out of hypersensitivity. Ternan -
sky’s words are the same hateful 
and dehumanizing rhetoric that 
has cast Latinx as inherently vio -
lent and dangerous for centuries, 
fueling the idea that we are in 
need of assimilation and control. 
/T_his keeps prisons overpopulated 
with Black and Latinx faces, po -
lice oﬃcers’ knees on necks, and 
division as a central force in our 
society which impedes societal 
progression as a whole. Dear white folks, 
Racialized people are tired of 
teaching you how to be good al -
lies. /T_he work in the white com -
munity has to also be facilitated 
by the people within it. Do better. 
Quickly. 
Now enough about the hurt, 
let’s talk about healing. Por mi 
gente preciosa y querida, I urge 
you to wrap yourself in the deep -
ly healing forces made possible 
through community. /T_here are 
places that exist in San Diego that 
love, honor, and celebrate you. In 
my own quest to feel connected, 
I sought to capture some of these 
places in sunny San Diego. 
I urge you, take to these spac -
es like bees take to honey and be 
nourished by them. /T_he follow -
ing spaces are painted with col -
ors of tradition and culture that 
cultivate safety in a material and 
physiological sense. I hope you 
will take pleasure in visiting these 
places and do so with a sense of 
respect for locals, of course. 
/T_his journey begins in Balboa 
Park at the Centro Cultural de la 
Raza, located at 2004 Park Blvd., 
San Diego, CA. Originally an 
abandoned water tank, the space 
was transformed into a Latinx 
hub for art and culture as a re -
sult of community activism in the 
1970s. Here, you can /f_ind rich his -
tory, movement art, exhibitions, 
workshops, and a safe place to be 
Latinx, no matter what that looks 
like for you. /T_his is also home to 
the monthly Tianguis de la Raza, 
a market designed to promote an 
autonomous economy and com -
munity building. Don’t miss the 
next one on Nov. 20! 
Next, let’s travel to Logan 
Heights, a historically Latinx 
neighborhood about 20 minutes 
from campus and accessible by 
the trolley. Despite years of se -

HECTOR ARRIETA
I had only ever heard of Jean 
Dawson in passing reference from 
a couple of friends before going to 
his show on Oct. 16, 2022 at the 
House of Blues in San Diego. I re -
ceived an invite to attend the show 
and saw that he featured A$AP 
Rocky in one of his albums. /T_his 
led me to assume that Jean Daw -
son would be a hip-hop style art -
ist; nothing could have prepared 
me for what came next. 
When I arrived at the House of 
Blues’ Voodoo Room, an extreme -
ly intimate venue, I was reminded 
of my early concert-going days: 
going to venues like the Teragram 
Ballroom and the Roxy in Los An -
geles. A/f_ter some standing around, 
the main lights dimmed, and the 
opening act, Junior Varsity, be -
gan to take the stage. It was at this 
point I began to realize what I had 
gotten myself into. Junior Varsity, 
with their bold stage presence 
— which included getting down 
from the stage to enter the mosh 
pit with the audience — and their Concert Review: Jean Dawson 
Image courtesy of Helix Creative Solutions for /T_he UCSD Guardian.
Everyone’s experience in a concert is unique to them, but more o/f_ten than not, they have underlying common -
alities that tie them all together. /T_hat was certainly the case when three A&E writers attended Jean Dawson’s 
show at the House of Blues’ Voodoo Room and realized that there was something both longtime fans and 
completely new fans of his could entirely enjoy. From the intimacy of the venue to the energy of the crowd and 
the performers, there was something for everyone to like.
even brasher punk sound, trans -
ported me back to a time when 
I attended shows for acts like 
Bleached and FIDLAR. /T_his was a 
great start to the night.
A/f_ter the chaos of Junior Var -
sity, we stood and waited again as 
the venue played some ‘80s clas -
sics. It was during this time that I 
began to digest the kind of event 
I was at and I came to realize that 
Jean Dawson would likely oﬀer 
more of this chaotic energy that 
was still wa/f_ting through the air. As 
I stood, beginning to crave more, 
the lights dimmed once again and 
Jean Dawson and his band made 
their way out onto the stage. /T_he 
crowd’s pent-up anticipation 
turned into cheers and screaming. 
What was once a dimly-lit venue 
was now a sea of phone camera 
/f_lashes. I was so close to the stage 
that I could now see every detail 
on Jean Dawson’s face; he had 
on a metal jaw that was strapped 
around his head, which reminded 
me of MF DOOM’s metal mask. 
I had not listened to a song by 
Dawson prior to attending, but 
I was entranced by this unique sound that would be disserviced 
by simply referring to it as “punk. ” 
Dawson had energetic songs that 
incited moshing, jumping, and the 
splashing of water on fans, but he 
also had slower, so/f_ter songs, that 
allowed for moments of standing 
or swaying in awe. 
Both the intimate venue and 
the acts of the night brought me 
back to a time of carefree concert 
enjoyment, something that big -
ger venues o/f_ten can’t encapsulate. 
Simply put, Dawson was a joy to 
watch and provided me with a 
much-needed fresh breath of air.
Jean Dawson can only be de -
scribed as a crowd pleaser. When 
he’s on stage, you can’t help but 
be satis/f_ied by his overwhelm -
ing presence and eclectic fashion 
taste. 
It would not do him any justice 
to identify him by any particular 
performance or track. Instead, 
Dawson should only be remem -
bered by moments — experiences that you know you would not be 
able to experience anywhere else. 
Fortunately, those moments were 
bountiful the night he performed 
at the House of Blues in San Di -
ego. 
As a natural crowd-pleaser, 
Dawson always knows what people 
want to hear, and he knows when 
to let the music talk. His carryable 
red microphone stand found its 
way into the swarm of people be -
fore him. /T_hey chanted the catchy 
lyrics of tracks like “MENTHOL*” 
and “SICK OF IT*. ” His satis/f_ied 
smiles were more than enough to 
let everyone know how proud he 
was to perform for such a lively 
and dedicated crowd. 
Before his performance of “BAD 
FRUIT*, ” he told the crowd he 
would try to get Earl Sweatshirt 
to sing his verse for the track via 
FaceTime. Most took this as a 
joke, but to their surprise, a quar -
ter of the way through the song, 
Dawson was asking for his phone. 
He fumbled with it before telling 
the crowd Earl Sweatshirt didn’t 
pick up but said “hi” anyway. Re -
gardless, not a single smile in the 
audience dwindled. 
A little over halfway through 
the performance, Dawson men -
tioned that his mother was in the 
audience that night. As a native 
of Southern California, it seemed 
/f_itting for his family to attend the 
very /f_irst concert of his long tour. I 
couldn’t help but feel like the night 
was a little more special because of 
their presence.
A/f_ter the show, Dawson took 
the time to sign merch and take 
photos — a luxury that may not be 
aﬀorded his fans in the future as he 
grows in fame. However, the fact 
he is willing to do so now speaks 
volumes about his immense ap -
preciation for the people who sup -
port his work. /T_here is a special 
place for artists like Jean Dawson 
who create moments like these, 
and it’s hard to imagine any other 
person at his level who could cre -
ate such moments. It seems he’ d 
rather enjoy the “CHAOS NOW*” 
then celebrate later. 
Midway through his sold-out San Diego show, Jean Dawson di -
rected the audience’s attention to 
one of its own members: his mom. 
Speaking directly to the crowd, 
Dawson slowly recited a line from 
his song “BAD FRUIT*”: “In my 
mother’s eyes, everything I did. ” . 
“Do you guys know what that 
feels like?” he prompted the audi -
ence. No one answered. Instead, 
silence abounded as those of us 
in the Voodoo Room partook in 
this profound moment between 
Dawson and his mom, between 
his mom and the rest of us in the 
crowd, and between us and him. 
/T_hat is the essence of Jean 
Dawson’s appeal;he proudly and 
enthusiastically practices his bot -
tom-up approach to fame. He does 
not fancy himself a god (*ahem* 
Kanye), so removed from his fan -
base that his persona connotes a 
certain detachment from the rest 
of the world. Jean Dawson, despite 
his fast-accruing fame, is a people 
person. He invites fans into the 
realm of his personal life, creat -
ing an environment of intimacy. 
When performing “PIRATE RA -
DIO*, ” a slower song about his 
distraught relationship with his 
father, Jean commanded the at -
tention of his audience through 
piercing vocals and solid back -
ground instrumentals. Even with 
more classically pop-punk tracks 
like “Policia, ” Jean matches the 
energy of his crowd, strengthen -
ing the o/f_ten tenuous connection 
between audience and performer. 
Jean is able to simultaneously 
invoke the sonic gi/f_ts of an un -
hinged rockstar while fostering 
environments of intimacy and ap -
preciation for those who enjoy his 
music. /T_he ability to do both is of -
ten the key to distinguishing good 
artists from truly great ones.By HEctor Arrieta

Additionally, he highlights that 
any dislike for Jeﬀeries stems from 
racism. Leah Jeﬀeries is a 12-year-
old actress. Audiences haven’t 
even seen her performance yet. It 
is ridiculous that her abilities are 
already being brought into ques -
tion when there is nothing to go 
oﬀ of. While it is disappointing 
that Riordan had to make the post 
in the /f_irst place, it is wonderful 
to see an author that is capable of 
elevating and standing up for his 
actors. It is exciting to see how 
much faith he has in them. Given 
that he wrote the story, he has a 
very thorough understanding of 
the characters. His endorsement 
of the cast has only increased my 
eagerness for the /f_inal product. 
/T_his event prompted me to 
think about other instances where 
beloved characters or preexist -
ing characters were recast in re -
makes with actors of color. It is beginning to become a common 
occurrence where a remake is an -
nounced, a character is cast with a 
POC, and we are met with waves 
of backlash. It’s incredibly dis -
appointing that despite how far 
we’ve claimed to have evolved past 
racism, talented minority actors 
are still dealing with this non -
sense. Another example of this is 
Halle Bailey’s casting as Ariel in 
“/T_he Little Mermaid. ” /T_he back -
lash with “/T_he Little Mermaid” 
has been almost constant since the 
casting announcement has been 
released. /T_here are tons of com -
plaints that Bailey cannot pull oﬀ 
the role of Ariel. Y et, none of the 
criticisms hold any weight. /T_here 
are claims that Ariel is Danish and 
should be played by a white ac -
tress. /T_his is primarily due to the 
fact that the writer of Ariel hails 
from Denmark. I would argue 
that Danes can look any way they 
would like. Additionally, Ariel is a member of a /f_ictional species 
that lives underwater. It seems 
pretty ridiculous to get caught up 
on what kind of race a /f_ish should 
be. It’s genuinely frustrating to see 
this time and time again. /T_here are 
people who truly believe that what 
a person looks like can aﬀect their 
acting ability, their singing ability, 
or their ability to be considered 
a human being. No one can deny 
that Bailey is talented. Disney cast 
a talented singer for a musical /f_ilm 
and she even dyed her hair red for 
the role. What more can we ask 
for? Having a Black Disney prin -
cess doesn’t aﬀect the well-being 
of any of the naysayers. However, 
it makes a huge diﬀerence for au -
diences who can resonate with the 
character, which makes this whole 
situation worse. 
/T_he teaser trailer for “/T_he 
Little Mermaid” came out just a 
few weeks ago, and already there 
are tons of kids who are so excited for this movie. I’ve seen countless 
videos of little Black girls reacting 
to this trailer, getting absolutely 
thrilled that they look like their 
favorite Disney princess. Addi -
tionally, little kids of other races 
have no issue with the casting. 
Ariel is still their favorite princess. 
/T_hey are just as excited to see the 
movie. /T_here are no negative con -
sequences and only positive ben -
e/f_its for kids growing up to see this 
on the big screen. Obviously, I’m 
not under the notion that writ -
ing this article is going to change 
the minds of racists. However, I 
think that it is worth noting that 
this does matter. As of right now, 
there is one Black Disney princess. 
Tiana is Black because her being 
Black has a cultural signi/f_icance 
to her story and the character. I’m 
excited to see this recreation of 
“/T_he Little Mermaid. ” I think that 
the rest of the cast is phenomenal 
and Bailey has the perfect ambi -ance to play a princess. 
I wanted to focus on these 
two examples because they are 
incredibly topical as we are in 
the midst of these projects and 
their backlash. But, they also have 
the very real ability to aﬀect little 
girls growing up right now, giving 
young girls another Disney prin -
cess to look up to or a new strong 
protagonist who looks like them. 
However, this cycle of recasting 
parts — and racist backlash isn’t 
new. Zendaya had to deal with 
ridiculous complaints due to her 
part as MJ in the latest Spider-
Man trilogy. With hindsight, audi -
ences can recognize that Zendaya 
took the character and made it 
her own. Tom Holland’s iteration 
of Spider-Man was the third in 
a variety of diﬀerent interpreta -
tions. Each installation made the 
story its own, so why was Zendaya 
the only one who got slack for it? /uni25B6 RACEBENDING , from page 1

The ambience of editorial 
and customer reviews for the 
romance book “It Ends with Us, ” 
by #1 New York Times Bestsell -
ing Author Colleen Hoover is 
overwhelmingly positive, many 
praising it for how it addresses 
abuse and survival and weaves 
a raw, emotional story together. 
Other reviews are caustic, some 
from Goodreads refusing to call 
the book a romance and address -
ing how Hoover does not delve 
into abuse appropriately or use 
much other than poor, shock-
value writing. 
Hoover is just one example 
of many authors — such as those 
from the Wattpad-to-publish -
ing-industry pipeline — gener -
ating much positive feedback 
from readers mingled with other 
readers who express evident dis -
interest in their writing styles 
and themes of potential present 
toxicity in relationships. There is 
an intriguing contrast between 
those looking for a simple, fun 
or emotional storyline — wheth -
er it be romantic or thrilling — 
versus those more invested in 
the writing craft of the author, 
sans any improper representa -
tion of those struggling. This 
stark contrast, additionally, may 
even hint at the more elusive 
readers who pick up a book be -
cause of curiosity on the strong 
opposing viewpoints based in 
the themes or plot.
Regardless of the polarizing 
reception, the book by Hoover 
— just one of many others — has 
gained a following on TikTok 
and a household-name status in 
the young adult realm. In fact, 
Hoover’s new book “It Starts 
with Us” has already boomed in 
sales since its release a few days 
ago, despite the other book being 
released back in 2016.
Just a cursory skim of Tik -
Tok users’ straightforward book 
reviews and discussion of all 
things literary — or #Book -
Tok — paves a way for grasp -
ing which books are particularly palatable and which aren’t in a 
rapid manner. This means that 
marketing can be reshaped to 
accommodate these groups of 
interest in the form of book dis -
plays or incentivizing popular 
BookTok creators to promote 
certain books or ideas. Over the 
summer, Barnes & Noble even 
teamed up with TikTok for a 
#BookTokChallenge to encour -
age youth to read some popular 
books on their website.
There are even labels for the 
BookTok videos or discussions 
such as “Books to read when you 
need a good cry” or “Books to 
read when you feel alone, ” which 
streamline readers’ wishes to 
find out more about a plot with -
out reading a blurb or skimming 
a synopsis, in a visually appeal -
ing video. Some users even ap -
peal to nostalgia with usage of 
dark academia backgrounds, like 
tinted bookshelves, and a wist -
fulness for the past or an ideal -
istic trope. As exemplified by the 
aforementioned book, popular -
ity surges and returns for books 
as well, especially when specific 
titles go viral. This means that 
the potential for a book even 
more than a decade old to get big is feasible, something that older 
classics usually had a better grip 
on. 
The Guardian even details 
the snappy, attractive aspect of 
BookT ok videos on TikT ok; ob -
taining a visceral reaction means 
being impassioned about a book 
in the first place and appealing 
to pathos. By projecting a posi -
tive or emotional feeling towards 
a book, another reader may be 
inclined to pick it up.
And unsurprisingly, many of 
the books that go viral are young 
adult and romance or thriller — 
genres that appeal to the youth 
that are on TikTok already.
In other words, a few swipes 
in TikTok or this realm of im -
mediacy instead of often lengthy 
YouTube video reviews or just 
classic word-of-mouth with 
loved ones can ironically provide 
a way to discover a book. The 
simplicity of the short reviews or 
discussions on TikTok can even 
draw the interest of non-avid, 
disinterested readers and reel 
them in. 
Popular YouTubers or “Book -
Tubers” like polandbananas -
BOOKS or Christine Riccio once 
dominated the scene of book re -views — from singular reviews 
on books to reviews on favorite 
novels or series — with their 
meticulously edited but organic 
and conversational ten minute 
or so videos. While this scene 
hasn’t vanished, there is a dif -
ferent, more gravitational pull to 
#BookTok in that it’s even more 
concise.
This platform of immediacy 
has propelled the growth of a 
very fortunate list of books to 
sell quickly forward, from his -
torical retellings such as “Song 
of Achilles” or “Circe” by Mad -
eline Miller to the contempo -
rary, gray-toned “ A Little Life” by 
Hanya Yanagihara. Again, spe -
cific genres are rising in popu -
larity among the reader commu -
nity even if these books — along 
with other ones such as romance 
“They Both Die at the End” by 
Adam Silvera— didn’t hit the 
market very recently, either.
Nonetheless, this has led to 
a multitude of questions, from 
whether a medium like the au -
diobook for the average busy 
individual “counts” as a book 
to whether reading a plethora 
of young adult books “has the 
right” to be defined as real lit -
erature. Moreover, this poses 
the question of how books gain 
traction. Alex Aster, for one, 
is a popular TikTok user and 
writer who published a fantasy 
novel, “LightLark, ” just a cou -
ple of months ago. In the next 
month, the book received quite 
an amount of critique, some of 
which may have stemmed from 
her potentially wealthy and im -
modest upbringing but also due 
to disappointment at her alleg -
edly elementary writing.
There has further been news 
of Aster and her team attempt -
ing to stifle the criticism, which 
points to how popular books can 
easily become an echo chamber 
of positive reinforcement despite 
valid opposition or opposing cu -
riosities as well as frustrations 
from those on platforms like 
Wattpad who remain eager to 
publish their own book.
This details the ease at which 
popular books travel and how 
they may not deliver once they 
end up in an intrigued individ -
ual’s lap. 
Perhaps the novel beauty 
is that TikTok popularity is 
not solely generating charm -
ing dances or creative food vid -
eos. It is now allowing authors 
to bloom in success through 
#BookTok more than ever and 
giving readers a place to read, 
then reconvene and chat about 
their favorite books in an even 
quicker fashion. Additionally, it 
is further reminding individuals 
that popularity is not necessarily 
equivalent to critical acclaim or 
superior writing.
This might lead to tricky ter -
ritory when authors grapple with 
difficult subjects such as abuse or 
trauma in ways that don’t agree 
with many of their audience, but 
the lack of the latter may not de -
ter those simply interested in a 
quick or fun read at face value. 
It probably won’t even deter the 
authors who make a lucrative 
living from their book sales to 
continue doing what’s launched 
them to The New York Times 
Bestseller’ s list in the first place.

this kind of backlash. Noma Du -
mezweni faced anger when she 
premiered as Hermione in “/T_he 
Cursed Child. ” 
It is incredibly frustrating, for 
the actors, the audiences, and for 
the project as a whole. At the end 
of the day, race does not nega -
tively aﬀect an actor’s ability to 
give a performance. /T_his unfor -
tunate trend accomplishes noth -
ing. /T_hese characters stem from 
source material that have diﬀerent 
interpretations. Percy Jackson is 
a book and readers were always 
le/f_t up to their own interpreta -
tions of the character. Annabeth’s 
actions in the story matter much 
more than how she looks. No one 
was appalled that Walker Sco -
bell is blonde, despite Percy being 
originally written as having dark 
hair. “/T_he Little Mermaid” is a fai -
rytale, a story that was o/f_ten told 
orally before someone decided to 
write it down, which means that 
what she looks like doesn’t really 
matter. Additionally, she lives in 
the sea. /T_here are no rules for the 
lineage of sea creatures. How Ariel 
looks has no bearing on her story. 
/T_he same goes for MJ, a story from 
comics that has held multiple in -
terpretations. Even Hermione was 
never explicitly given a race in 
the books. Growing up, I always relished that Hermione’s de/f_in -
ing physical feature (her bushy 
hair) was something I could relate 
to, and I felt happy to see a POC 
Hermione in the West End cast. 
/T_his disgust or contempt for these 
castings comes from a place of 
racism. Whether it is consciously 
or subconsciously, it is still racism. 
/T_his comes from a fear that these 
decisions will change the charac -
ter or the story. In reality, these 
decisions only open the world to 
larger audiences. /T_his allows for 
more children to become enam -
ored with the stories and fall in 
love just like generations prior got 
to. It is a good thing that we are 
reenvisioning beloved characters 
in diﬀerent ways. 
I think that when we are look -
ing at remakes and recastings, the 
most important thing is that the 
character doesn’t get butchered. I 
can understand faithful audiences 
being frustrated by a recasting 
that takes something away from 
the original character written or 
changes aspects of the character 
in ways that make a diﬀerence. 
However, with these examples 
that we are talking about, no such 
action is taken. Annabeth is still 
considered an underdog and, if 
anything, her race reinforces the 
nature of her character due to 
the obstacles that are a result of 
her being a Black woman. Ariel is still kind, sweet, and a little na -
ive. Bailey has proven that she can 
play these airy characters. She has 
the ability to play a princess. Her 
race doesn’t aﬀect any of that. If 
there was any backlash outside of 
race I could understand. If these 
hecklers held issue with the por -
trayal of the character, if that was 
changed in some way, this anger 
could be justi/f_ied. But, this isn’t 
happening. /T_hese complaints are 
focused on race. Plainly put, that 
is racism. /T_he truth is the integral 
parts of these characters are the 
same as their source material. We 
are simply seeing them reimag -
ined in new ways. 
Now, I want to end this on a very speci/f_ic note. I am very ex -
cited to see “Percy Jackson” and 
“/T_he Little Mermaid. ” Getting to 
see Annabeth Chase, a character 
I’ve related to all throughout my 
childhood, depicted as not white 
is something that warms my heart. 
However, it is worth noting that 
these are both remakes of previ -
ous movies. /T_he /f_ilm climate we 
are in right now seems to love 
making sequels and remakes of 
prior shows. As long as we are 
in the space where that contin -
ues, remaking beloved charac -
ters with more diversity is a great 
way to include people of color in 
the conversation. However, this 
doesn’t take away from the fact 
that actors and audiences of color 
deserve their own stories too. We 
shouldn’t have to rely on a new 
iteration of an old character to 
feel represented. It is important 
to include people of color in the 
conversation and in the media. 
It is important to tell stories that 
aren’t traumatic, inauthentic, or 
stereotypical. /T_his remains to be a 
/f_ierce battle. It’s a battle I believe 
will always be worth /f_ighting. For 
now, I will continue to be excited 
to see characters I love depicted in 
new ways, but it is not something 
I will be settling for. /uni25B6 ANNABETH CHASE , from page 5

2.2% of students at UC San Di -
ego are Black or African Ameri -
can. /T_he majority of the student 
population is either Asian or 
White, which composes 50.6% of 
the campus. 
Being such a small fraction on 
campus, Black students face the 
dilemma of both macro and mi -
cro aggressions. /T_his is a dilemma 
that’s exacerbated because the re -
mainder of the population on cam -
pus is signi/f_icantly diﬀerent. 
As detailed in a report by the 
University of Maryland, racial mi -
croaggressions can be categorized 
into subgroups. Focusing on vo -
cal aggression, subgroups include 
themes such as color blindness and 
individuals being aliens in their 
own land.
Color blindness entails state -
ments meant to indicate a person’s 
denial of race being a societal at -
tribute. /T_he concept of “Alien in 
their own Land” involves state -
ments that assume an individual is 
foreign-born based on their race or 
ethnicity. 
In a BMC Psychology study, 219 
students were surveyed on their 
experiences with microaggressions 
on their college campuses. One of 
the report’s conclusions mentioned 
that young Black women all em -
phasized thesexualization of their 
racial and physical features as ex -
otic.
Racial microaggressions are 
too familiar to Black students, as 
expressed in an interview with an 
anonymous student, who will be 
referred to as Marissa.*  
Marissa recalled a moment 
where her hair was the center of at -
tention for her suite. She normally 
keeps her hair in braids, but she 
has to take her braids out at times, 
which reveals her natural afro-
style hair. She recalled how her suit -
emates began to pet her hair 
with some going to the extent of 
taking photos of her hair. Ma -
rissa described the moment as 
strange since she was both un -
comfortable and felt as if she was 
an animal in a zoo.  
/T_hroughout the year, Ma -
rissa was referred to as “nice 
looking for a Black girl” and was 
also asked “how do you feel be -
ing at UCSD as a Black girl?” by 
white male students. It took her 
months to accept this treatment 
from others.
Microaggressions are subtle 
forms of racism acted in an un -
named nature which makes 
them hard to identify, rectify, 
and quantify. Although classi -
/f_ied as unnamed in nature, acts 
of racial aggressions towards 
Black students are prevalent on 
a macro level as well. 
In an interview with another 
anonymous student, Riley, ra -
cial aggression is exempli/f_ied to 
be more than unnamed nature.* 
Riley lived in a suite where 
slurs directed towards Black in -
dividuals were spoken around 
casually. Weeks a/f_ter the /f_irst 
confrontation, one of Riley’s 
suitemates began to make com -
ments on the smell and look of 
Black individuals, to which they 
approached their suitemate with 
frustration.   
Following that altercation, 
the suitemate reported Riley to 
Residential Life, claiming that 
they were threatening him and 
owned a gun. A/f_ter telling their 
story, Riley said:
“I don’t own a gun, I’m 19. 
I understand that you’re rac -
ist, but that doesn’t mean I have 
some type of inclination to hurt 
you.” 
Although not able to share 
speci/f_ic details about the in -
cident under FERPA, UC San 
Diego Oﬃce of Communica -tions oﬀered this statement to /T_he 
UCSD Guardian: 
“We aﬃrm each individu -
al’s right to dignity and strive 
to maintain a climate of justice 
marked by mutual respect for 
each other. /T_he university takes 
allegations very seriously.” 
Riley was directed by ResLife 
oﬃcials to a diﬀerent housing lo -
cation. Although physically away 
from the problem, they expressed 
their frustration in this state -
ment. 
“It made me realize that this is 
such a big reason why I am living 
oﬀ campus next year. /T_he faculty 
are [f------ s---] with every part of 
UCSD,” they said.
/T_he prevalence of both micro 
and macro aggressions towards 
Black students seems to go unrec -
ognized by not only students, but 
university oﬃcials as well.
In an interview, the traditions 
co-coordinator for the Black Stu -
dent Union, Damanza Uzor, re -
/f_lected on UCSD’s promotional 
motto. 
“Diversity, equity, and inclu -
sion. /T_hat’s what we hear, but the 
university is not doing much to 
manifest that statement,” he said. 
Furthermore, Uzor referred 
to the motto as  “empty terminol -
ogy.” Rather, the university seems 
to have used the small presence of 
Black students on campus to pro -
mote diversity. 
When asked if expectations 
are being met by the university, 
Uzor responded with this state -
ment. 
“Realistically, no. It feels like 
we’re just here and the university 
isn’t really looking to do more 
than that.” 
Allyson “Kida” Bradley, the 
director of Triton Lobby Corps, 
substantiated this statement. In 
an interview with /T_he Guard -
ian, Kida referred to the lack of 
meeting the expectations of Black 
students by the absence of hair in -clusivity. 
Located in Price Center, Salon 
101 serves as the only hair salon 
on campus but can’t service Black 
students with afro-textured hair. 
Although considered less impor -
tant to other students, Kida voices 
this example as being important 
within the Black community. 
“I think once we [establish 
a Black salon on campus] we’ll 
be able to boost enrollments for 
Black students but also show a 
real physical community space 
where Black people can feel com -
fortable in,” she said.
Personally, Kida said that she 
doesn’t feel comfortable on cam -
pus as a Black woman. She rec -
ognizes the fact that UCSD has 
failed to appropriately acknowl -
edge a racist past, speci/f_ically 
with the 2010 Compton cookout 
incident. 
On a macro scale, Kida ex -
plains that the failure to acknowl -
edge such a disappointing event 
in UCSD’s history shows how the 
university attempts to push the 
conversation aside rather than 
/f_inding a remedy with its past. 
/T_he signi/f_icance of ignoring 
such an event was also brought 
up in an interview with Kennedy 
Co/f_ield, a member on the board of 
the Black Student Union. 
Co/f_ieldexplained how the 
2010 incident has been mentioned 
in meetings with university oﬃ -
cials, but little was done a/f_ter the 
fact. /T_he situation seemed to be 
brushed oﬀ by UCSD administra -
tors. 
A/f_ter being asked about the 
connection between the univer -
sity and Black students, Co/f_ield 
referred to the 2021 Black Gradu -
ation where Chancellor Kholsa 
didn’t make an appearance. Rath -
er, the Chancellor pre-recorded a 
video for Black graduates. 
“What he was saying, it 
seemed not from the heart type 
thing. It seemed like a generic statement,” she said. 
Further, Kennedy mentioned 
how the noticeable disconnection 
between UCSD and Black stu -
dents can defer Black applicants. 
/T_he gap to close between 
UCSD and Black students is a gap 
that will take eﬀort, from stu -
dents to professional staﬀ. When 
asked how students can partici -
pate in the closing of this social 
gap, Kida said:
“Never stop consuming his -
torical knowledge. It can develop 
your self-awareness about micro 
or macro aggressions you may 
be pushing, but it also helps with 
overall intelligence.” 
With intelligence comes ac -
tion. Co/f_ield advises the univer -
sity to shed more of a spotlight 
on Black students and Black ex -
cellence, especially during Black 
History Month. 
In their 2022 demands, the 
Black Student Union is pushing 
for more funding, retention, and 
recruitment with their motto 
being “Community Building & 
Wellness”. 
As for students who want to be 
a part of this social change, Uzor 
leaves us with this statement: 
“Aﬀord yourself the same re -
spect you aﬀord other people. 
When people aren’t giving you 
that standard, you have to de -
mand that standard or nothing is 
going to change.”

Pessimistic but nonetheless true, 
life is replete with disappoint -
ments. Since TikTok gained im -
mense traction in 2020, the con -
cepts of core memories, main 
character energy, “my life is a 
movie,” and romanticizing one’s 
life became widely adopted 
among Gen Z. 
   For instance, take prom — 
the final hurrah of a students’ 
high school experience. At least 
for myself, I grew up watching 
movies like “Footloose”, “Mean 
Girls”, “Pretty in Pink”, and  “The 
Perks of Being a Wallflower”, all 
of which contain a highly ideal -
ized version of what a school 
dance might entail. And so, ex -
pecting their high school home -
comings and prom night to mirror 
these movies, any teenager might 
anticipate a night full of intense 
drama, containing a novel love 
interest, illegal activity, rebellion, 
and an ambience of sparkles and 
strobe lights. Ultimately though, 
despite movie culture and social 
media platforms curating and in -
graining a utopian version of a 
young adult’s life unto its view -
ers, this expectation is unrealistic. 
Yes, prom night was without a 
doubt a core memory for me. And 
just like past homecomings and 
for most “hyped up” events, the 
highlight of my night was getting 
In-n-Out with my friends. Pretty, well, anticlimactic.
    Another example: birthdays. 
Whether it be through Pinterest 
boards or from watching the icon -
ic “16 Wishes,” there is a highly 
idealized version of birthdays 
that exists — a version where one 
might hope to be showered with 
endless love, surprises, and pres -
ents. But, more often than not, 
birthdays leave people in tears, 
with unfulfilled expectations, and 
comparing the number of Insta -
gram story shoutouts received to 
those of the previous year. 
    So, what I am trying to say is 
that there can be so many faults 
with over-fantasizing and over-
dramatizing life — especially 
historical, socio-cultural, and po -
litical events and topics. Because 
the truth is, life is mundane and 
the “teenage dream,” 15–second 
snippets and reels that users post 
on social media, are masterfully 
curated moments that are not rep -resentative of day-to-day life. 
But maybe if you are anything 
like me, you just cannot help it. 
And if that is the case, then I come 
to the rescue — shift the way you 
romanticize your life. Instead of 
hyperfixating on the most ideal 
(and unrealistic) outcomes, I urge 
you to romanticize the season — 
literally, and metaphorically — 
that you are living through and 
everything that it encompasses. 
And for right now, it’s fall. 
    Quite literally the best couple 
of months, fall is a time when one 
can embrace the seasonal depres -
sion, the delectable scents, and 
seasonal menu items, the low-ex -
posure photos and aesthetics, the 
anticipation of winter, the art of 
layering clothes, and the somber 
music. In other words, the ambi -
ence is simply unmatched. So this 
is me giving you a free pass to ro -
manticize your life to the max — 
take advantage.    Something that I love about 
the romanticization of fall is that 
it does not promote unattainable 
productivity and the “grindset.”  
Rather, I would personify the sea -
son of fall as an enabler. 
    Allow me to illustrate a typical 
fall morning for myself. After be -
grudgingly waking up to my 7:15 
a.m. alarm and knowing what 
treacherous day is ahead of me, I 
curate a fall outfit, “treat” myself 
to a pumpkin cream cold brew 
(though it is not really a treat if I 
do it everyday…), absolutely blast 
my “mellow rainy days” or “fall 
updated” playlist whilst driving to 
school, park in the Sixth College 
parking structure (with a permit, 
of course!), and briskly walk to 
class with music blasting through 
my wired earbuds (because I find 
them much more aesthetically 
pleasing than AirPods) — all 
while appreciating the crisp air 
and overcast sky. Fall does not demand much of me. 
It does not suck away my energy 
the way that 95-degree weather 
does. Instead, its serenity — its 
entirety — restores me. 
    This brings me to my final point: 
music. I truly find music the most 
crucial aspect to cater to and am -
plify my desired mood. Listening 
to artists such as Cigarettes After 
Sex, Beach House, Lana Del Rey, 
Phoebe Bridgers, and The 1975 
— just to name a few — encap -
sulate fall and dramatize my super 
dramatic college student life. 
    My activity between the hours 
of 1–8 p.m. is kind of a gray area, 
but it is something along the lines 
of buying a subpar $4 latte from 
Audrey’s cafe in Geisel Library, 
doing homework somewhere on 
campus, and consuming Plant 
Power. 
    But what I am aware of is that 
I end my school nights by admir -
ing the early sunsets and the light 
drizzles, opening Pinterest and 
pinning to my “FALL” board, 
and lighting a fall-scented candle 
— currently burning is “Scarlet 
Pumpkin.” 
    So the next time you are sad that 
açaí bowls and 8 p.m. sunsets are 
out of season, splurge on a festive 
drink, listen to Taylor Swift’s “All 
Too Well (10 Minute Version),” 
and continue to fester your melan -
choly mood. 
    That, is fall in a nutshell. 
The Romanticization of  Fall

   Sunset and sunrise, dusk and 
dawn. I experienced both on two 
different peaks with the UC San 
Diego Hiking Group, walking 
around a total of 10 miles.
   A friend recently introduced 
me to the hiking club. So, when I 
checked on Monday and saw two 
hikes on Saturday and Sunday, I 
quickly put my name to sign up 
for rides. Thankfully, I was quick, 
because the limited spots filled up 
within minutes.
   That Saturday afternoon, Octo -
ber 15th, I arrived at Pangea park -
ing, a bit confused about where 
exactly to wait. 
   But, I found my carpool, and 
thank goodness we made it safely. 
We parked somewhere farther and 
walked a bit to finally meet up 
with the rest of the group. And off 
we went!
  First, we went downhill. My 
knees could feel the impact, and 
I wished I had hiking sticks. It 
started drizzling. Then, the drizzle 
turned into a light rain. Some peo -
ple did not bring raincoats and got 
soaked. One brought an umbrella 
and some walked in their under -
wear. I had my rain jacket and 
draped it over me and my back -
pack like a hooded cape — kind 
of like what Little Red Riding 
Hood wears. It does well to keep 
the rain out while allowing venti -
lation from the wind.
    The slope got steeper and steep -
er. There was one part where we had to scramble up by using our 
hands and feet. When we got to 
the top, we realized there was an 
easier path. We let the people be -
hind us know.
   At the summit, we saw a bit of 
the sunset and the red sun peeking 
through the clouds.
  We still had a ways to go and 
we wanted to make the most of 
the daylight. It would be difficult 
going downhill because the rain 
made everything slippery. So, we 
took a quick group photo, then 
made our way down. Of course, 
some people slipped and fell in 
the mud. Fortunately, there were 
no injuries since our descent path 
was much gentler than our ascent 
— just a lot of laundry to do af -
terward.
   Now, it was completely dark 
outside, and we turned on our 
phone lights. Good thing we were 
a large and loud group — that 
way the mountain lions wouldn’t 
come. Someone mentioned telling 
ghost stories. Walking at the front 
of the pack without the comfort of 
being surrounded by smartphone 
lights, I’ll admit I jumped at a few 
shadows.
    After all that, we went to La 
Jolla Village for dinner. I returned 
to my dorm, did some follow-ups 
on our hike, showered, and went 
to sleep. I had my alarm set to 
4:30 a.m., but changed my mind 
and set it to 5 a.m. instead.
   I woke up the next day feeling 
like I was going to the airport — 
that feeling when you’re commit -ted and have to wake up no matter 
what. After all, the people driving 
and organizing the event were so 
kind, I couldn’t let their time and 
effort go to waste. I had a speed-
walk race against time to the Price 
Center loop. My body was feeling 
alright from yesterday, and I got 
there just in time.
    We drove to the trailhead. It was 
dark when we arrived, but cars 
came by every now and then. You 
could tell how popular this spot 
is. We grouped up, and I ate the 
hotdog buns I had hastily thrown 
in my bag. By the time we set out, 
we could kind of see each other’s 
faces.
   We hiked up the misty moun -
tain. Most people didn’t talk that 
much, perhaps because the uphill 
was tiring. I’d talk to some peo -
ple, power up, and talk to others 
until I was near the front.
   We reached Potato Chip Rock, 
still shrouded in mist. The Potato 
Chip is slippery, perhaps because 
of the rain yesterday plus the mud 
on everyone’s shoes.
   As people reached the summit, 
we took turns on the Potato Chip. 
I went on twice to check out both 
ways of getting on and off. Then, 
we socialized and explored other 
areas, climbing here and there and 
taking photos.
   I was one of the last to leave 
because I wanted to make sure 
everyone was there. By that time, 
another large group had arrived. 
We were all a little hesitant to 
leave and potentially forget some -one, and that groupthink kept us 
just standing there waiting for no -
body for a while. But in the end, 
we left. I didn’t hear of anyone be -
ing left behind.
  The walk downhill was slow -
er than I expected. The clouds 
cleared up and people wanted to 
explore the stuff along the way 
that they were too tired to explore 
when coming up, taking every 
chance to scramble up rocks and 
take selfies with the panoramic 
view of San Diego.
   We went to Philz Coffee after -
ward. I almost never drink coffee, 
but I thought I might as well try. I 
got a latte because someone told 
me it’s less strong: more like cof -
fee in milk than milk in coffee. I 
burnt my tongue.
A girl and I did a post-hike walk 
back to campus. I got back to my dorm and shared my pictures with 
the group discord.
    Then, I hand-washed my clothes 
in the sink and shower. They were 
muddy, and I’d feel bad for the 
next person using the washing 
machine if I had used that instead. 
Handwashing gave me quite a 
workout — especially wringing 
them. Now, you know what to do 
if you ever want strong fingers, 
wrists, and forearms.
   I showered and hung my clothes 
under my bunk bed using metal 
clips. I’m an out-of-state student, 
and I flew here with nothing but 
a backpack and carry-on bag, so 
those were pretty much the only 
clothes I had. While I waited for 
them to dry, I attended The UCSD 
Guardian lifestyle meeting on 
Zoom in my spare underwear, 
took a nap, then started typing. Back-to-back Hikes with the UCSD Hiking Group

Vo l l e y b a l l  ( 1 0 – 1 2 ,  3 – 7  B i g  We s t ) 
team played up to the occasion 
against California State Univer -
sity Bakersfield (5–17, 2-8 Big 
West), with a resounding victory. 
The team did not disappoint on a 
day of celebration, as Homecom -
ing, the Karen E. Reis Memorial 
Game, and a celebration of the 
Women’s Swim Team’s Cham -
pionship all coincided. The team 
dominated from start to finish, an 
impressive victory for a team that 
has been tested with a variety of 
hotly-contested losses to begin 
conference play. 
   Right from the start, UCSD came 
into the game with a willingness to 
be creative with their scoring. To 
open the scoring, junior setter Izzi 
Strand perfectly placed a dump 
in the shallow corner. Freshman 
outside hitter Katie Rapp got the 
crowd involved early with a big 
block, putting the Tritons up 6–3. 
The Tritons maintained a healthy 
lead, and sophomore outside hitter 
Ava McInnes punctuated the Tri -
ton’s hot start with wedging a shot 
down the middle between block -
ers to go up 15–9.
   The T ritons kept rolling in the 
first set, with a run continuing 
with freshman outside hitter Zaria 
Henderson’s ace to inflate the lead 
to 19–9. Most of the Tritons er -
rors seemed to be self-inflicted, 
with the Tritons playing at a very 
high level when fully engaged. 
The outmatched roadrunners were 
putting up a fight, but it seemed as though the strong spikes from the 
Tritons put them in a bind. Just as 
the set began with a setter dump, 
senior libero Naya Dong’s dig 
turned into an assist after another 
timely dump from Strand to grant 
the Tritons the first set, 25–13. 
   CSUB gained some rare early 
momentum, but a stifling block 
from sophomore middle blocker 
Emily McDaniel cut the deficit 
to one, 7–6. McDaniel owned 
the most impressive sequence of 
the day, with seemingly effort -
less blocks in a single rally three 
distinct times, only to have the 
rally finished by a laser kill from 
— who else? — Emily McDan -
iel. After McDaniel’s heroics, the 
consistently influential Hender -
son knotted the game at ten with 
an off tempo kill from the back 
row.
   The run would continue, with 
a role reversal resulting in Mc -
Innes setting up Strand for a tight 
cross shot, putting the Tritons up 
13–10. Henderson’s kill on the 
next point was the sixth straight 
point, each of which coming off 
of a dig from the veteran Dong, 
forcing a CSUB timeout. The 
Roadrunners did not fold though, 
and came up with a little run to 
make the Tritons sweat. A pow -
erful kill from McInnes off a set 
from Strand is the climactic re -
sponse the Tritons come up with. 
Shortly thereafter, Dong snuck 
her serve in the back line for an 
ace, putting the Tritons on the 
precipice of going up two sets to 
zero. A block from junior middle 
blocker Shara Da Silva put a roar 
in the crowd, and the Tritons won the second set 25–19.

ebration occurred for the UCSD 
women’s swim and dive team. 
The crowd rose to its feet in sup -
port of the 2022 MPSF Confer -
ence Champions and the team 
and coaching staff was given 
hearty applause. Impressive vic -
tory was certainly a theme for the 
Triton Homecoming. 
   To start the third set, both teams 
kept it close with motivation still 
high for both teams. Da Silva 
broke the back-and-forth with 
a monster kill down the middle, 
giving the Tritons a 12–10 ad -
vantage. McInnes’ multiple aces 
catalyzed a 4–0 run after the 
roadrunners tied it back up, so 
the Tritons took a 16–12 lead. 
McDaniel continued to impress as she scored a quick kill off a re -
bounded block, again represent -
ing the Tritons’ ability to score 
both in and out of system. Con -
tinued pressure from the Tritons 
inflated the lead to 23–15, forc -
ing another timeout from CSUB. 
The Tritons continued their run 
and streak of dominance with a 
Henderson service ace to end the 
game at 25–15. 
   The Triton sweep is impressive 
not only because of how impres -
sive the team looked, but also be -
cause of how difficult it has been 
for this team to get over the hump 
in league play. This win could 
certainly be a momentum-build -
er, but whether or not the Tritons 
can build off this win remains to 
be seen.

with Coach Ricci Luyties after 
the game, asking him if there are 
any takeaways from this win that 
he would like to replicate in the 
games to come. Luyties said, “I 
think our serving was tough, and 
if we can keep pressure on teams 
that way, we are going to have a 
lot of success scoring points. We 
are still feeling out [how to find 
consistency] with our middles 
and getting sets with our middles 
together, so that is something that 
if we can get better on through 
the year, it will make our team 
better.” 
   The Tritons will look to do just 
that in their next game at CSU 
Northridge on Oct. 28, in what 
should be another exciting Big 
West matchup. 
Tritons Rue Missed Chances in Homecoming Week Loss to Cal State 
Northridge
  In the penultimate home game 
of the 2022 season, UC San Di -
ego men’s soccer (7–7–2, 3–4 Big 
West) fell to California State Uni -
versity, Northridge (7–4–4, 4–2–1 
Big West) in a disappointing 1–0 
loss. Despite dominant stretches 
of possession and several good 
chances, the Tritons were  score -
less and ultimately conceded a 
Matador header late in the game, 
which would be the only goal 
scored in this close match. 
   The first half was an even, tense 
affair, with both the Matadors and 
Tritons struggling to keep posses -
sion in a tightly packed midfield. 
Attempting to alleviate pressure 
on their midfielders, both teams 
employed a long ball tactic for much of the period. While neither 
side had much success finding 
their forwards through on goal, 
there were several chances by way 
of set pieces and counter attacks.
   CSUN appeared to be the more 
threatening side in the first few 
minutes, winning a corner only 
forty seconds into the game. After 
a good cross pinballed in the box, 
the Matador shot was eventually 
blocked, and the ball was cleared.
   UCSD’s first real opportunity 
came in the eighth minute after 
a skillful, driving run by senior 
midfielder Alessandro Allen that 
led to a Triton corner. The ensuing 
delivery fell to junior midfielder 
Alan Kim, whose shot from a 
tight angle flew over the bar. Al -
len and graduate student forward 
Nick Cirrito found themselves in threatening positions several 
times throughout the first half, but 
the CSUN defense stifled any at -
tempt on goal. 
   The Tritons almost took the lead 
in the 27th minute when Cirrito 
was played into space on the Mat -
ador byline. His cross into the box 
almost snuck in at the near post, 
but the CSUN goalkeeper made a 
good save to keep the game level. 
A few minutes later, a CSUN for -
ward was played through on goal, 
but Triton graduate student keeper 
Dominic Peters did well to come 
off his line and beat the Matador 
player to the ball.
   The second half proved to be far 
more action-packed than the first, 
as both teams seemed to come to 
life after the break. The Matadors 
controlled the first 10 minutes of 
the half, threatening the UCSD 
goal several times. In the 50th 
minute, a floated cross left the 
Triton defense scrambling but 
could not find the head of a Mata -
dor player, leading to a goal kick. 
Soon after, a CSUN player hit the 
crossbar in the 53rd minute, rat -
tling the frame of the goal with a 
right-footed effort from the top of 
the box. 
   After surviving this wave of 
CSUN attacks, the Tritons found their stride and controlled much 
of the remaining half. Their attack 
was mostly filtered through the 
left hand side, with sophomore 
midfielder Carter Jacobus, sopho -
more forward Max Carvalho, and 
Allen all finding space to cross 
into the box. One such instance 
came in the 70th minute when 
a ball over the top found Cirrito 
with his back to goal. The forward 
laid the ball off to sophomore 
midfielder Andrew Valverde, who 
cut back towards the middle of 
the park. An incisive pass into 
the path of graduate student mid -
fielder Mason Haubrich set up a 
curling left-footed effort towards 
the CSUN goalie but struck the 
post, keeping the Tritons mere 
millimeters away from breaking 
the deadlock. 
   Three minutes later, a second 
chance fell to the Tritons in a sim -
ilar fashion. Cirrito, once again, 
found his teammate Jacobus 
with his back to goal. The mid -
fielder got to the byline, and his 
outswinging cross found the foot 
of junior midfielder Euan Clark. 
However, Clark’s curling effort 
dropped gently into the arms of 
the CSUN goalkeeper.
   The CSUN goal came on the 
counter attack in the 85th minute, completely against the run of play. 
A Matador defender won the ball 
in his own half and advanced the 
ball on the right hand side. CSUN 
drove to the edge of the box and 
lifted a cross that found the head 
of a crashing CSUN forward. 
The header bounced over the out -
stretched arms of Dominic Peters 
and into the net, giving CSUN a 
decisive 1–0 lead. 
   UCSD’s final attacks were fruit -
less as the Matadors implemented 
a low block to preserve their lead. 
A last-ditch free kick sailed high 
and out of play. This was the fifth 
consecutive loss for the Tritons 
and the fourth loss in Big West 
play in which the margin of defeat 
was only one goal.  UCSD can be 
proud of their stellar defensive 
display; unfortunately,  the score -
line is not quite reflective of the 
impressive performance of the 
backline. 
  Currently sitting in seventh in a 
tightly contested Big West, UCSD 
will be hoping to finish their sea -
son with a victory. The Tritons’ 
last matchup will be Senior Night 
against UC Irvine where the team 
will try to end conference play 
with a winning record.
