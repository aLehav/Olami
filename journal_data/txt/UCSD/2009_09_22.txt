The UC Board of Regents met in San Francisco last week to 
discuss its options in the face of the dire budget crisis currently facing the university. The board is attempting to  close a fund-
ing gap of hundreds of millions of dollars.
UC Vice President Patrick Lenz presented a plan to the regents 
last Wednesday that included a mid year fee increase starting in Jan. 2010 of 7.5 percent, and a fee increase starting Fall Quarter 2010 of 15 percent. He blamed the fee increases on rising operation costs and dramatically reduced state funding.
According to the presentation, the additional student fees would 
bring in $262.2 million in net revenue that would allow the university to eliminate fewer jobs, cut fewer classes and curtail fewer campus services.
“To students: I’m sorry, I regret it, but the state has stopped build-
ing the highways to higher education — they’ve started building toll roads, ” UC President Mark Yudof said.

‘Toll Roads to Education’
By Sarah Alaoui
Staff Writer
Two days after a tragic pole-
vaulting accident left him uncon-
scious, Revelle College sophomore 
Leon Roach was declared brain-dead on Sept. 5 and taken off life sup-port at Scripps Memorial Hospital. 
Nineteen-
year-old Roach had driven down to San 
Diego from Huntington Beach that day to practice with the UCSD pole vaulting team. 
Under a coach’s supervision, Roach 
was practicing a drill in which he hung upside down from a rope slung from a tree. He overshot the padded landing mat and slammed his head against the concrete. 
“The rope drill is something that’s 
a great practice, ” said Roach’s brother, Curtis Hendrick. “I’ve been doing it for 10 years. It helps with your form. ”
He was immedietely rushed to the 
hospital, but doctors were unable to revive the unconscious athlete.
“Leon died doing what he loved 
to do most, ” his mother, Mary Ann Roach, said. “I take great comfort in the fact that he was where he wanted to be. ”
When it came to choosing 
between UCSD and UC Berkeley, Roach’s passion for pole vaulting took precedence — there was no room for him on the team at Berkeley, so he turned the school down for UCSD and a spot on the university’s track team.
“When we went to visit Coach 
Darcy and Tony [at UCSD], they made him feel like a track star, ” Mary Ann Roach said. “They were so happy to have him; he really felt like the team was a family. ”
A Huntington Beach native, Roach 
was planning to major in biochemis-
try. He recently took a 13-day motor-
cycling trip to Mexico and Canada with his father and brother, Curtis Hendrick.

Over 1,000 faculty members 
have signed an online petition in 
support of a systemwide walkout on Thursday, Sept, 24 at 12 p.m. to protest the effects of the UC budget cuts.
Sixty of the signatures come 
from UCSD. 
The campus walkout will 
begin at the entrance to Gilman Parking Structure.
A coinciding strike held by 
the University Professional and Technical Employees, a union that represents over 11,000 UC workers, will take place on the same day.
Carolan Buckmaster, UCSD 
Research Associate and San Diego Chapter President of 
UPTE-CW A, explained that the 
two events were planned for the same day in order to achieve maximum disruption on the first day of classes at most UC cam-Amid increased class sizes, cuts to student 
services and employee layoffs, university heads look to hike student fees twice this year.

The UC Union Coalition took 
a vote of no confidence in UC  
President Mark G. Yudof earlier this month, a gesture of their dissatis-faction with the employee furlough plan and budget cuts ordered by the university in recent months.
The Coalition, which represents roughly 70,000 UC employees, too a vote between Aug. 26 and Sept. 2. According to UCSD employee and union leader Carolan Buckmaster, 9,600 faculty and staff members — of the 10,000 who participated in the vote — said they had “no confi-dence” in Yudof. 
“[The vote] shows the univer-
sity and President Yudof that [the voters] don’t approve of the direc-tion that he’s taking the university, ” Buckmaster said. “We hope that he will think about his responsibility, and hopefully he will make some changes. ”
The declaration is partly in 
response to a mandatory employee furlough plan the UC Regents insti-tuted this July in an attempt deal with

“The faculty decided themselves 
what would be best for them as indi-
viduals, ” Buckmaster said. “Some of them will go to the picket lines, some will bring their classes to the picket lines and some will do teach-ins. We see this as step one. ” 
On July 29, the Academic 
Council voted unanimously to take at least six of their mandatory fur-lough days this academic year on days of instruction.
However, President Yudof and 
the Chancellors rejected the plan, announcing that faculty would have to take their days off on non teaching days usually dedicated to research, committee activities and other academic obligations. 
“Nobody has said sanything 
about reducing committee and other service obligations, ” UCLA Professor Stephen Bainbridge said in his blog, www.professorbainbridge.
com. “Likewise, nobody has said 
anything about reduced research expectations. So where exactly is my furlough time off?”
Subsequently, an open letter to UC faculty began circulating on Aug. 31, calling on faculty to suspend teaching on Sept. 24 unless three demands are met: no furloughs or paycuts on salaries below $40,000, immediate institution of the Academic Senate Council’s July 29 recom-mendation regarding the implementation of fur-loughs and full disclo-sure of the UC budget.
The University of 
California Student Association, which represents all students within the UC system, unanimously passed a resolution in support of the systemwide walkout shortly after the petition began circulating.
The American 
Association of University Professors has also endorsed the walkout.
 “We recognize that the cur-
rent budget crisis in the state of California impacts people across the state, and that we must do our part to deal with the budget, but we also hope to broadcast the fact that ‘busi-ness as usual’ cannot continue in a 
state of crisis, ” Michael Davidson, UCSD litera-ture professor and vice chair of the literature department, said in a statement.
Davidson empha-
sized that walkout orga-nizers are not merely concerned with faculty pay issues, but that they aim to preserve the qual-ity and accessibility of education within the UC system. 
“I signed the walkout 
petition because I believe those of us who study, work and teach at UC San Diego must begin to educate each other and the public about the 
very real possibility that the UC system is increasingly becoming a private enclave accessible only to the wealthy, ” Spanish and Chicano literature professor Jorge Mariscal said. “We do not believe students 
and their families should carry the burden for financing the university, or that students should have to go into debt for a public education. ”
According to Buckmaster, the 
University of California released a letter to the faculty indicating that the univeresity has emergency funds available to replace professors if they are not in class. 
UCSD communications pro-
fessor Brian Goldfarb said that although he plans to teach class on Thursday, he will support students if they choose to participate in the walkout.
“The labor unions have got the 
ball rolling and we can’t stop it, but my hope is that professors will go to our classes anyways and educate the students on what’s going on with the state institution, ” he said. “I’ll be at my class on Thursday teach-ing, but I’ll also be giving students the opportunity without penalty, to walk to the picket lines and join and express their discontent with state legislators. ”

severe reductions in state funding.
The yearlong program, which 
began Sept. 1, requires over 100,000 
UC employees to take 11-26 manda-tory unpaid days over the next year. 
The furlough plan establishes 
seven different salary groups of employees. The employees who earn the least  — $40,000 or less — will be subject to a 4-percent reduction, while those who earn over $240,000 can expect to see up to a 10 percent reduction in pay. 
Buckmaster listed pay cuts, 
executive pay raises and lack of union participation in the decision-making process as major sources of faculty discontentment. 
University spokesman Peter King said there is no way to tell if 10,000 people actually participated 
in the vote, because he claims there 
is no documentation. 
“Even if it was 10,000, there are 
70,000 union members, so that’s one in seven — and we have 180,000 employees, ” King said. “So you’re talking about a very small fraction of the people who participated, in essen-tially what is a public relations antic. ”
King said mediocrity must be 
avoided at all costs.  He fears if tuiton is not raised, the univer-sity will not have enough revenue to sustain its best professors and UC degrees will lose their value. 
“The state is obviously having 
a financial crisis and we’re willing to do our part, but it’s a painful thing, ” he said. “The first choice was a balanced budget, but Sacramento whacked it. ”

More regents expressed sup-
port for the proposal than they had 
during fee-hike proposals in previ-ous years, explaining at the meet-ing that they felt the board had no other option now that it had already resorted to increasing class sizes, laying off university staff and employees and implementing fur-loughs.
Protestors at the meeting pointed 
out that students would be paying more for larger classes and reduced services. They also argued that the hikes would undermine the uni-versity’s commitment to access and affordability.
A.S. Vice President of External 
Affairs Gracelynne West gave public input at the meeting. 
“[The proposal] came as a shock, ” 
she said. “They’re cutting student services, [and] with budget cuts and the furlough plan, students are pay-ing more and getting back less from the university. ”
Following a public comment 
period during which students and faculty stood up to speak out against the furloughs and fee hikes, a group of about 100 protestors broke up the meeting with chants criticizing Yudof. Fourteen demonstrators were arrested. The meeting resumed 20 minutes later.
The mid year increase would 
raise student fees by $585 for resi-dent undergraduates and $633 for nonresidents. The 2010-11 fee increase would increase tuition by $1,344 for resident undergraduates and $1,458 for out-of-state under-graduates.
Resident and nonresident gradu-
ate students would also see their fees increase next semester, by $654 and $681, respectively.
The regents approved a similar 
proposal in May, which increased student fees by 9.3 percent begin-ning this quarter.
If the new increases are passed, 
it will mark the eighth time in eight years that the regents have voted to raise student fees.
The proposal also includes a 
“return to aid” component, in which 33 percent of the revenue generated from the new fee increases would be funneled back into financial aid in order to lessen the impact of fee hikes on financially needy undergraduates.According to the proposal, how-
ever, the return-to-aid money alone would not be enough to fully cover the fee increases for low-income students — generally those with household incomes below $60,000 to $70,000. The university would rely on an increase in Cal Grants to cover the remainder.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 
June state budget proposal includ-ed plans to cut all new Cal Grant awards and halt future increases for grant renewals, preventing max-imum awards from increasing to compensate for future UC fee hikes.
“With the unpredictability of 
what happened to the Cal Grants, not knowing if there’s enough aid really factors into if students can afford to go to school, ” West said. “[The university] should find alter-native solutions instead of turning their backs on faculty and students, because it’s definitely not sustain-able. ”
In addition to the fee hikes, the 
regents also discussed a proposal to additionally raise fees for business and engineering students, due to the higher costs associated with educat-ing students in those departments. They also reviewed a proposal to further reduce freshman enrollment by 2,300 students.
The regents will vote on the pro-
posals in November.

Props to the House of Representatives for passing a bill that would 
overhaul federal ﬁnancial aid and allot $40 billion to Pell grants.
Flops to Housing, Dining and Hospitality’s Black Book for cheaply 
imitating the UCSD Guardian’s annual Student Survival Guide.
The views expressed herein do not necessarily represent the opinions of the UCSD Guardian, the University of California or Associated Students.We Need an Education, Not a Podcast<*)<+.,;*90:0: Do Your 
White Cup Right: Fro-Yo for Dummies
The frozen-yogurt epidemic has 
swept San Diego. 
It has boldly invaded La 
Jolla mini-malls and Price Center East alleyways, turning mangos red, all berries pink and fruits to ‘froots. ’ We’re no longer in Y ogurt World — rather, we’ve been flung into a creamy 
universe of Berries and Beans, Yum 
Yum Y os and Y ogart Fusion. 
But amid this delicious, 
unrelenting flurry of cutesy gibberish and exotic toppings, many are still clueless when it comes to maximizing the potential of the white cup. Not to worry — the Guru is here with an inside guide to ordering frozen yogurt.
First, evaluate your obstacles: 
customers who lack any coherent plan of attack. These dazed wanderers are infamous for dawdling in front of yogurt levers, overwhelmed by the prospect of picking from the vast selection of flavors before them. Step deftly around these uneducated vagrants and continue on your way. 
Grab yourself a sample cup and 
approach the yogurt pumps with confidence. Maintain concentration as you move swiftly between each unoccupied station, taking time to sample each flavor. Avoid the glare of suspicious employees. Do not, I repeat, do not make eye contact. These are not people, but mere roadblocks on your path to yogurt glory. 
Next, you must choose your flavor. 
Resist the urge to crank out a sloppy seven-layer concoction — these hastily arranged disasters almost always trigger a barfy flavor overload. As a general rule, plain tart is complimentary to almost everything (i.e. mango tart and plain tart), fruits go well together (i.e. strawberry and banana) but nuts do not (coconut should never touch peanut butter). More unorthodox flavors such as green tea and taro usually taste better alone, as they tend to be incompatible with the majority of toppings. If you’re just in it for the Fruity Pebbles, go with plain tart and find the real flavor at the topping bar. 
Don’t be afraid to slurp some 
yogurt from the top of your cup. (Every lick is a subtraction from the 38 cents per ounce you’ll be paying once you place your container on the discerning silver scale.) Wrap both hands around it so your thumb and index are cupping its rim, then thump the bottom on the topping counter. This will pack the yogurt tighter and allow more room for what’s to come.
Now, onto the most challenging 
phase of construction: the toppings. They are the jewels to your crown achievement and must be handled 
with care. It is no doubt tempting to 
compromise your well-thought-out plan for a sudden frosted Circus 
Animals craving. But be strong. 
Remember: Y ou’ve committed to a 
fro-yo flavor and must pay it due 
compliments. If you chose peanut butter, you’ll have to stick with basic 
chocolate treats. Sometimes fruit 
flavors taste good with chocolate 
chips, but usually they just need more 
fruit. Chocolate calls for a classic combination of strawberries and 
almonds. Plain tart will take whatever 
you give it, but don’t forget to practice UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA — UC President Mark Yudof 
made one thing clear during his public address on Sept. 11: Even in the midst of this recession, he’s not willing to compromise quality or access to the university, which — to the unknowing 
student — might seem a pretty compelling promise. 
The thing is, we can’t have both. Despite President Yudof ’s pride in the fact that we enroll twice as many Pell Grant-eligible students as any Ivy League school, in order to maintain the same standard of accessibility of which President Yudof is so proud, we have to make a choice.
Do we sustain our current level of excellence and hike stu-
dent fees so unreachably high that many cannot benefit from a 
QUICKTAKES
The current health-reform proposal that has 
everybody’s panties in a twist is the “ America’s Healthy Future Act, ” as proposed by Senator Max Baucus (D – Montana) and the Senate Finance Committee. While the plan is the closest proposal to actual bipartisan legisla-tion, issues with its allocation of funds (and proposed sources of revenue) mean that there’s something for senators on both sides of the aisle to dislike.
Plus, the plan’s relatively low price of $856 
billion (compared to the House’s proposed $1.5 trillion) has some major drawbacks. Though all individuals will be required to have some form of coverage, in accordance with Obama’s wish-es, the bill offers only $458 billion to subsidize low-income families, as opposed to the House bill’s $773 billion. This allows conservatives across the board to paint mandatory health care as a costly burden to the average working family. Meanwhile, its lack of a public- health option frustrates liberals and makes it unlikely to be signed into law as is.
While the Baucus plan is a good first step to 
necessary compromise, it also makes the fatal 
error of trying to please everybody, with the 
end result of pleasing nobody.

Staff WriterFederal Health-Care Proposals
Earlier this month, President Obama 
famously declared that he would “not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits” — bad news for the Democrats behind America’s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, also known as HR 3200. This plan proposes a $1.5 trillion overhaul of the health-care system over a 10-year period and, in the process, would add $239 billion to the federal debt.
As one of the earliest proposals on 
the health-care table, HR 3200 adheres very closely to Obama’s requirements: It penalizes those without insurance and offers coverage for preventative proce-dures like checkups. 
Because it follows the president’s 
guidelines so closely and has such high predicted costs, however, Republicans stamped this bill as a liberal creation. Without the essential bipartisan support that would have made it a viable option, it has largely faded from the public eye — and given the fact that it would expand our federal deficit, which other plans 
allegedly will not, it’s not the most desir-
able option, either.As theoretical proposals go, the Obama-Biden guideline lays solid groundwork for any subsequent reform bills; it contains 
both Democratic and Republican suggestions and offers possible funding sources.
This hypothetical bill would improve the cov-
erage of those who already have insurance, and also make it available to those who don’t. Ideally, it also must keep future costs to a minimum while decreasing the current costs of health care.
Two of the most prominent proposals are those 
of the Senate Financial Committee and the House Tri-Committee — a less palatable option thanks to its deficit-widening price. The Baucus PlanILLUSTRATIONS  BY KIM CYPRIAN /GUARDIAN

Women around the world and in 
our local region need preservation of 
their rights as human beings instead of baby-making machines. It is our envi-ronmental responsibility to provide means for a better life to many women and girls struggling in developing countries as well as in developed coun-tries that enforce unjust laws based on religious or cultural beliefs. 
Our environmental crisis is a 
direct result of our growing popula-tion’s carelessness. Every day 200,000 more people are born and increase our population’s burden on the planet by polluting and depleting resources. 
Women around the world are 
raised to believe they have no other options than to give birth to more children than they often want, add-ing to rising poverty levels and an unhealthy population. 
The solutions to this problem are: 
restricting family size, making abor-tion and contraception available and legal, encouraging alternative lifestyles and, of course, allowing universal access to education.
We can learn from struggling areas 
like Africa that availability of family planning can significantly improve life. 
Knowing that over 5,000 women 
die in childbirth each year and that two-thirds of the illiterate world population are women, we must feel very fortunate to live in a country with accessible medicine, doctors and education. 
But the truth remains anywhere 
that to be a responsible species liv-ing on Earth, it is our obligation to defeat outdated beliefs which prevent the logical needs of our exponentially destructive population.

San Diego residentDear Editor,
There’s a lot of talk about the 
opposition to Obama’s health-care plan. Some call it communist, assail-ing it as an elimination of human freedom. But honestly, where’s the problem? 
Insurance companies have ethics 
panels that determine if end-of-life procedures are worth the cost. Republicans don’t call those “death panels. ” 
Insurance companies also limit 
which expensive medicines are available to their customers, but Republicans don’t call that “health-care rationing. ” 
Obama talks of limiting reim-
bursements in order to cut costs, and opponents call such measures a travesty. However, it’s well under-stood that insurance companies cut costs by shedding patients who make claims. When they do this, we are to believe it is justified for some reason. Honestly, only Obama’s plans get the inflammatory labels.
 These folks are not angry about 
health care. They are not upset that the next time they apply for health insurance, a government program will appear in the list of options.

Sometimes we Christians do come across in an 
arrogant, self-righteous way that smacks of intolerance.  
I heard about a preacher on campus who was very hostile 
and insulting of university students.  In my opinion, he 
was a poor representative of Jesus Christ. However, most 
Christians are not that way.  Christians are basically tolerant of people 
from other religions and persuasions.  In a pluralistic society, it is necessary for all of us to get along, to respect the personhood and rights of one another.  We are an ideologically and religiously diverse people, and unless we learn to live in mutual care and respect, our society won’t be able to survive as a free democracy.
Having said these things, I want to speak to a related issue.  In a 
pluralistic society, and particularly in a university campus setting like UCSD where comparative religions and anthropology courses abound, it is hard not to be influenced by religious and moral relativism.  A climate of relativism causes many students and faculty to interpret any strong religious belief, including Christian belief, as intolerance, often resulting in misunderstanding, disrespect, and sometimes ridicule toward those who hold these views.
The assumption is that one cannot believe in any absolute truth or 
moral values without being intolerant. But that’s really not the case.  Actually every major religion has some non-negotiable “truths” that contradict the beliefs of other religions.  And all the founders of the world’s major religions had teachings that were different from one another, and in many cases, were mutually exclusive of one another.  For example, the nature of God, the nature of humankind, the need for salvation of some kind, the means of salvation, and the concept of afterlife are essential teachings of all major religions, and most religions hold mutually exclusive points of view on these things.
Is it being intolerant to believe in something or Someone that others 
don’t believe in?  It seems to me that that’s not intolerant, unless the believers feel a need to force everyone else to believe what they believe, or unless they belittle those who disagree with them.  Actually, I believe it is much more intolerant to treat people of religious conviction as if their convictions are of no value. Or, just as bad, as if they are equally valid with everyone else’s religious belief.  The only way that can be true when dealing with mutually exclusive truth claims is if all religious beliefs are equally invalid.  That viewpoint shows disrespect for the convictions of all religious believers, and relegates them to the area of fantasy or fiction, as if hey have no relevance in the REAL and objective world.
Tolerance is a two-edged sword that cuts both directions.  We 
Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.  We believe Jesus loves every person and people group, that He died for our sins, that He rose from death and now, as risen and living Savior of the world, offers to every human being a personal love relationship and the gift of eternal life.  Further, we believe that every person on this planet deserves the opportunity to hear about Christ’s love and to respond to His invitation to eternal life.

No, the problem they have is with Obama

San Diego residentDear Editor,
Regional water usage in San Diego has 
dropped, but San Diego locals should not stop there. The city imports 90 percent of its water form outside sources such as the Colorado River and the Sierra Nevada Runoff. The city’s reliance on outside sources for water is a major reason why individuals should become aware of the San Diego water crisis and be publicly informed on simple methods through which they could cut down on their water usage. 
Simple methods households could use to 
help conserve water include repairing faucet leaks or replacing washers with more efficient ones. People should avoid flushing their toi-lets when it is unnecessary, such as flushing insects or other trash down the drain. When brushing your teeth or washing your face, you should never keep the water running. Water usage is usually estimated to increase during the summer months, but simple methods, such as taking shorter showers, could help 
reduce this.

John Muir College seniorUC education? Or do we accept the fact that, for 
now, we can’t afford to keep the expensive pro-fessors and research that gave the university its esteemed reputation?
It’s a tough question to answer, but we must 
remember that the goal of a public university is to provide affordable higher education to any-one who wants it. 
It isn’t ideal, to be sure, but the lesser of 
two hard-hitting evils in this situation is to cut spending on services and faculty. We bet-ter hope, probably in vain, that those pricey professors will stick around San Diego and Berkeley for the California sunshine even if they could make more at Johns Hopkins or Columbia University, because raising student fees 44 percent in two years — as Yudof has proposed — will compromise access. 
After the $662 increase the regents insti-
tuted for the current academic year, students now pay $7,788 per year. By the 2010-11 aca-demic year, they’ll be paying $10,302. That’s a 32 percent increase — and with the recession at work, you can safely bet that most don’t have 32 percent deeper pockets.
 Yudof stated that a third of fee increases for 
undergraduates would be used on financial aid, as will half of the graduate student fee increases (their fee hikes will sting even more: up by as much as $654 for Winter Quarter 2010 and $1,506 for next fall, depending on the pro-gram). Even so, that’s a bit like punching some-one in the eye and then offering him gauze and body tape — okay, maybe some Neosporin, too. It’s just a vicious circle. 
Rather than commanding funds from 
students only to give it back to those with aid packages, Yudof ought to be assessing other forms of damage control: Though a fee increase may be unavoidable, trimming the fat through further service cuts as well as layoffs could make the blow a little less painful. At a public university with a total enrollment of over 190,000, the interests of the many have to be taken into account — and chief among those interests is giving everyone a chance to enroll.
Lower on most students’ lists are non-
essential offerings and services like psychologi-cal counseling, concerts and events and on-campus clubs. Because — as rewarding and as valuable as those non-necessities can be — in a crisis of this magnitude, the focus needs to be on preserving what every university must pro-vide: a simple classroom education. 
Yudof was quick to remind us that the 
poorest UC students won’t be impacted by the increase. Under the university’s Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan, implemented this academic year, those families with incomes below $60,000 per year currently don’t pay any educational or registration fees, and under his proposal that program would extend through next year. 
Students with family incomes from 
$115,000 to $180,000 are covered, too — President Obama instituted a tax break for those in that income range that will offset the increases. 
Though it’s certainly nice that Yudof isn’t 
proposing we trade the poorest students for fancy lab equipment, and we can presume that students falling in the $150,000 range and above will still be free to park their BMWs in Pangea Parking Structure come next year, Yudof ’s proposal creates a huge middle-class problem: The average student falls into neither category. In Fall Quarter 2008, the average par-ent income of freshmen across all campuses was $90,472. UCSD freshmen, however, report-ed an average family income of $82,114.
Yudof reminded us that those who will be 
most adversely impacted, should his proposal come to fruition, are not the “genuinely poor. ” But for the student whose family narrowly misses that $60,000 cap, the extra $3,000 per year can go a long way — and can be the deciding difference in being able to afford health insurance, or any number of other basic living expenses that many will not be able to afford as easily, even if they aren’t “genuinely poor. ” 
Assuming room and board fees stay exactly 
the same for the next year (probably not the safest bet), the cost of attending UCSD would balloon to over $28,000 for 2010-11, which would amount to a staggering 34 percent of that average family’s annual income. 
Granted, even before these increases, many 
families still forked a hefty portion of their wages over to the university. But in a time when nearly everyone has less, Yudof ’s insis-tence on charging students 44 percent more in two years is an especially harsh slap in the face. Softening the blow with further service cuts and layoffs might not be ideal, but until that $535 million deficit-eliminating donation pulls through (we’re looking at you, Mr. Gates), no choice of action will please everyone.

▶ LETTERS, MYVTWHNL8 THE UCSD GUARDIAN  TUESDAY , SEPTEMBER 22, 2009  OPINION
HOME
ON
Not long after UCSD officials 
studded palms around the freshly finished Rady School of Management in 2007, they 
turned their gaze, naturally, to the park-ing lot across the street. (High-rise expansion has always been a top priority for the university; parking lots, not so much.)
So, with $113 million collected from 
student-fee revenue, Housing, Dining and Hospitality (HDH) decided to give a new face to transfer housing, with the goal of expanding the on-campus popu-lation in size and diversity.
After three years of construction, the 
first phase of UCSD’s first-ever transfer-student housing complex — the Village at Torrey Pines — opened its doors to a new class of transfers on Aug. 26, 2009. Although it largely resembles the snazzy dorms and apartments in neighboring Eleanor Roosevelt College built in 2003, the Village comes with slightly better benefits: It will provide its nearly 1,060 residents with a two-year housing guarantee, and is the first facility on campus to offer a 12-month contract.
Plus, it comes fully furbished with 
appliances and amenities to make stu-dents feel at home — if home was a slick Ikea model.
The concept of on-campus transfer 
housing was first proposed seven years ago, but it wasn’t until 2005 that the real work began. After Village planners reviewed proposals from architects, shopped around for the ideal construc-tion company for the job and hashed through a jungle of budgets and higher-up approvals — a two-year process in all — the Village structure finally began to rise from the ground.  
Construction was broken down into 
two phases, on two separate sides of the street. Phase I — including a 15-story tower, seven low-rise complexes, a dining hall and a satellite bookstore — was to be completed by Fall 2009, and Phase II — including a 10-story tower, four low-rise complexes, a restaurant and cafe/grocery store — was to be completed by Fall 2010. 
Within months of their start date, 
crews had upturned the asphalt (which would later be recycled into the Village’s foundation) and installed an under-ground utility system in preparation for the massive housing structures that would soon take shape.
The Village now takes the title of 
tallest building on campus. It stands 15 stories tall, towering over the seven low-rise companion complexes below. The latest HDH project reflects UCSD’s new priorities for campus growth: vertical 
construction (in gen-eral) and home-style housing (in particular), erected with environ-mentally sound brag-ging rights. 
Transfer students 
began moving into their apartments and town-houses last weekend.
The Village’s low-rise 
complexes are spread over the site’s peninsular terrain, running parallel to each other with open social courts and lawns in between. Lucky for low-rise residents, the surrounding La Jolla 
community requested UCSD not raise an unsightly barrier along North Torrey Pines Road (as it had done with ERC), so the view from west-facing apartments have been left uncompromised. 
Students living in the tower have 
an even better panorama from their windows — one that overlooks the com-plexes below, the verdant Torrey Pines Golf Course to northeast and the Pacific Ocean stretching out from the glider port.
But calming ocean views come at a 
price. The Village charges roughly $30 more a month for those apartments with the best visibility.
“Those guys up there, in Building 
One, they have a really nice view, ” said Thurgood Marshall transfer student Josh Y ou. “Some of them were talking about watching the LPGA [golf tournament] from their balconies. ” 
Along with roommates Dan Triplett 
and Viet Nguyen, Y ou attended commu-nity college before moving to UCSD. 
“I kind of always wanted to get that 
on-campus living experience, ” said Triplett. “My brother went to a school where he moved in as a freshman, and most community-college students don’t really get that. ”
All three of the transfer students live 
in a low-rise apartment complex right across from the tower. Their living space comes fully furnished and includes a refrigerator, oven and microwave; in addition, students arrive to welcome packets containing cookies, candy, fliers and T-shirts.
Nguyen’s only complaint: “The couch 
is a little hard. ”
According to HDH, Villag e accom-
modations are designed to feel more open, contemporary and communitarian.
“I walked through campus and saw 
that the other colleges’ living situations didn’t look as nice; they all looked like jails, ” said Y ou.
Although they’ve only been living 
on campus since Saturday, Y ou and his roommates have already noticed the social perks of on-campus transfer hous-ing.
“Y ou can really tell that people in the 
Village really want to meet other people, ” said Y ou. “Y ou’ve got people knocking on your door just to say, ‘Hey, what’s up?’”
Y ou, Triplett and Nguyen pay around 
$1,300 a month each for their apart-ment, which covers utilities, cable and an annual $2,100 meal-point plan.
The selection process for this year’s 
transfer-student population was done lottery style; next year’s hopefuls, how-ever, will have to fill out applications similar to those used by the neighboring International House, and will be accepted based on merit.
Because transfer students belong to all 
six of UCSD’s colleges and therefore don’t all share the same general-education requirements, HDH decided to group students within the complex by their respective colleges.
Eventually, the Village will add more

    Museum of Contemporary Art    San Diego    1100 & 1001 Kettner Boulevard    San Diego, CA 92101    www.mcasd.orgTHE BOTTOM LINE At first glance, San Diego’s trio of catch-phrasey Thursday art parties seem one and the same. All are held at prominent museums, feature interac-
tive art-making activities, take place on the same night of the week and use art as an excuse to party.
The differences are subtle — and, after a couple of 
acai berry vodka-somethings, nearly imperceptible, as you’ll encounter many of the same personas at each event. These affairs rarely, if ever, land on the same night, and have diminished in frequency since the eco-nomic crash, so you’re also likely see many of the same faces.
Avoid the business-casual cr eeper trying to impress 
you with his entry-level salary and stained khakis. Vogue for the DiscoverSD.com photogs. Smile and wave awkwardly at your TA from across the gallery. Sneer at the girls dressed like they’re headed for Stingaree — the one who obviously didn’t come for the art. Unless, of course, that’s you — and in that case, sneer at the art snobs who don’t believe that art can be for everyone.
Because ultimately, that’s the goal of these new cen-
tury traditions: to prove that art is enjoyable and acces-sible. 
If you’re an aspiring young professional or just 
looking to snatch up a cougar/manther, 
Culture and 
Cocktails  at the San Diego Museum of Art in Balboa 
Park just might be your hunting ground.
For the $15 cover, you’ll get a drink ticket and access 
to the museum’s current acclaimed exhibitions. The most recent installment spotlighted the black-and-white portraits of famed photographer Richard Avedon — but Rivera, Picasso and Calder were just around the corner.
Stop by the gift shop on your way out, where you’ll 
find a collection of art reads, earthy jewelry, museum paraphernalia and even a phallic children’s toy or two.
The next iteration of Culture and Cocktails takes 
place on Oct. 29 from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. (shell out an additional $10 for the guided pre-tour at 5:30 p.m. 
and get a second drink ticket), and features “ American 
Artists from the Russian Empire. ”     If you wish you went to FIDM instead of UCSD or like live music with your Oppenheim installations, 
Thursday Night Thing  at the downtown San Diego 
site of the Museum of Contemporary Art is your ideal destination.
A $10 “donation” will get you in the door, 
a spot in the crowd for a performance by some 91.1 FM–sponsored band and an introduction to the provocative world of post-1950s art. Past events have included poetry jams and fashion shows, and Stone Brewery usually makes an appearance with its local, craft-brewed beer.     If you’re a cult-film buff or get a thrill out of dressing up for theme parties, you’ll fit in seamlessly at the Museum of Photographic Arts’ 
Pop Thursdays 
series.
A $6 entrance fee will do you 
the least financial damage of the three. Arrive early, because seating for the movie is first come, first served. “Barbarella, ” “Dirty Harry” and “ Animal House” are former features. Stay after to mingle (or prowl) in the gal-leries, and maybe even try your hand at draw-ing. Dr. Sketchy’s 
Anti-Art School 
has been known to bring a bur-lesque dancer or fetish model for DIY inspiration. And don’t forget to cram into one of the antique photo booths for 
some serious hamming and a new Facebook profile 
picture.
 Thursday Night Thing returns from a summer-long 
hiatus on Nov. 5 from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. to showcase the Tara Donavon exhibition. Y ou missed “This is Spinal Tap” at the last Pop Thursdays event last week, but keep checking the MoPA Web site for the next night, which will probably be sometime in November.

BEYOND THE BLACKBOARD:
SUMMER RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS
For the third summer in a row, a group of UCSD graduate students made the transatlantic 
passage to Spain — and not for your typical study-abroad sojourn.
Collaborating with volunteers, 
researchers and literature professor Luis Martin-Cabrera, the students busied themselves by collect-ing interviews from survivors of General Francisco Franco’s fas-cist dictatorship.
The researchers are 
part of the Spanish Civil War Memory Project, a group of students that has been collecting in-person interviews with audiovisual recording equipment since 2007. Their goal is to amass a digital archive of interviews, to be made available on the Internet.
For nearly 40 years after the Spanish 
Civil War, Franco inaugurated the lon-gest dictatorship in European history, lasting from 1939-75.
Martin-Cabrera initiated the project 
when he decided to work with human-rights organizations in Spain and the Special Collections Library in Geisel Library to create an audiovisual archive similar to those documenting the Holocaust at Y ale and the University of Southern California. He contacted the Association for the Recuperation of Historical Memory in Spain, who provided the project’s first group with survivors to interview. 
A year after their first summer 
abroad, organizers raised enough funds to send three groups during the sum-mer of 2008. Over the past months, graduate students traveled through Madrid, Barcelona, Granada, Málaga 
and the south of France seeking stories. 
Graduate student Scott Boehm, who 
blogged his travels for the UCSD News 
Center’s “Dispatches from the Field, ” has been working in Madrid, helping other teams in the area conduct nearly 40 interviews. A majority of the testi-monies are from former political pris-oners — one of whom Boehm encoun-tered one-on-one, when he interviewed José Benito Bartres.

months, professors, students and researchers kept the researchengines running, both in campus labs and around the world.
The Politics of 
Dissent
On the night of June 13, Babak Rahimi — 
whose childhood memories are enmeshed with the Iranian revolution of 1979 — was 
woken by shouts heralding President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s victory in Tehran. Rahimi was jarred; during his travels throughout the country, an exami-nation of each candidate’s campaign indicated that challenger Mir Hossein Mousavi had an advantage.
Months before Iran’s incendiary political protests 
broke out, the UCSD professor had been research-ing the impact of the Internet on Iranian elections. Though the country was on the cusp of an especially critical presidential election — set to take place on June 12, 2009 — Rahimi’s predictions were far less dissentious than the election’s actual outcome. 
“Of course, at that time, I had no idea how 
Iranian politics would dramatically change after the elections, ” Rahimi said. “During my research, I learned how a civil society — that is, the space between individual and state — can carve out new spaces of dissent in face of state repression. ”
During the violent turmoil that ensued, he turned 
his attention to the pivotal roles that minority and marginal groups, such as women’s organizations, were playing in post-election politics.
Rahimi said he also witnessed firsthand how the 
state used the rhetoric of democracy to quell the country’s swelling opposition. 
“I would say the social climate in Iran has cer-
tainly gone back to ‘normal’ , though there is always an element of unrest within the fabric of Iranian society, ” he said. “ At any moment, anything could happen or anyone could call out for a rally, paint an anti-government graffiti on a public space, where

than 380,000 square feet of new housing, din-
ing and community facilities.
“[The Village] is built on one quarter of the 
acreage ERC was built on, ” Director of HDH Mark Cunningham said. “This right now, this was a little less than the square-foot cost it cost to build ERC in 2003. ”
Although Phase II of Village construction 
— which will provide an additional 805 beds for transfer students —is still underway, the completion of Phase I has HDH hoping that transfers will be able to enjoy the same, if not better, communal on-campus experience that other undergraduates have enjoyed for the past 50 years. 
The Village does appear to reflect ERC’s 
communitarian design. From a pool of 38 architectural proposals, the university’s build-ing advisory committee chose a design that mimicked ERC’s spacious, modern appeal while taking on its own communal character.
During planning stages, HDH staff placed 
phone calls to incoming transfer students and asked what they wanted from an on-campus housing experience. 
Although the university hopes its efforts 
— toward creating a thriving social hive of the transfer-student population — take root, it recognizes that the nature of the Village is quite different from that of other housing communities on campus.
Unlike, say, John Muir College, the 
Village’s students have less to bond over: They don’t all take the same general-educa-tion courses or come into college with the same four-year, party-hard plan. This year’s on-campus transfer students range in age from 16 to 42.
According to Cunningham, the Village’s 
builders actually spent two nights shacking up in two of ERC’s apartments before start-ing construction, to make note of the build-ings faults — like thin yet over-insulated walls — and overcome them in designing the Village.
After the two-night experiment in ERC 
housing (which many students under-stand to be the nicest facilities on campus), Cunningham said he was sure he and his crew had the potential to build an even more impressive complex.
Though the Village recycles many of ERC’s 
basic architectural elements — like flat facades and vertical expansion — Cunningham said the Village was designed with atmospheric elements like wider windows and roomier walkways in order to foster a greater sense of togetherness. In addition, native-plant land-scaping will ensure minimum water usage within the community.
Once construction began, most of the 
Village’s more expensive plans — like move-able shutters and a communal 15th floor — had to be struck due to a tight budget. But soon thereafter, HDH got lucky. Though the economic downturn took a brutal toll on students and families everywhere, it couldn’t have come at a better time for the Village (whose funds, of course, had already been secured). Actualizing innovative designs and purchasing interior amenities became much more affordable, construction costs plum-meted and HDH building planners were able to re-implement many of the optimistic ideas that had originally characterized their vision of the Village.
“The amazing part [is that] this was actu-
ally in the original concept back in 2004 when we started the project — but we had to cut it out, ” Cunningham said, walking across the tower’s top floor. “ As things went on though, we obviously were able to put money back into the budget because costs kept com-ing down. ”
Along with aesthetic improvements like 
granite countertops instead of laminate and metal-plated plumbing fixtures in place of stainless steel, many of the Village’s last-minute upgrades were environmentally minded. On the exterior, steel-frame structures were erected instead of wood and high-efficiency windows were installed to reflect the heat and lessen the need for air conditioning. On the interior, low-flush plumbing fixtures, energy-efficient boilers and energy-efficient lighting

SORRENTO VALLEY/ MIRA MESA
(858) 550-5912 Crossfaded college students 
can breathe a collective sigh of relief. A study conducted 
by UCSD researchers suggests that marijuana use may shield the brain from some of the harmful effects of binge drinking.
Director of state campaigns for 
the Marijuana Policy Project Steve Fox claims the study’s results can be used to support the legalization of marijuana.
“This study suggests that not 
only is marijuana safer than alcohol, it may actually protect against some of the damage that booze causes, ” Fox said in a news release. “It’s far better for teens not to drink or smoke marijuana, but our nation’s leaders send a dangerous message by defending laws that encourage the use of alcohol over marijuana. ”
Dr. Susan Tapert, from UCSD’s 
department of psychiatry, was the study’s principal investigator. Tapert and her team of researchers con-ducted brain scans on 42 subjects, from 16 to 19 years old, to analyze the health of their brain tissue.
Good news for all young adults 
well-versed in the twin arts of boozing and bonging: Tapert said the results would likely be similar in those between the ages of 20 and 22.
The study compared three 
groups: binge drinkers, binge drink-ers who were also heavy marijuana users and controls. Researchers found that, overall, the white matter of the alcohol-marijuana group was of better quality than the alcohol-only group. White matter transmits information between brain cells and, when compromised, can affect memory, thinking and learning.
Which you can use as an excuse 
for why your stoned roommate got a better grade than you in MMW (or why your stoned self got the “ A ” and your hungover friend the “C”).
Other recent research has shown 
that heavy alcohol use in adoles-cents is injurious to the brain. This is bad news to underage drinkers, as it was formerly thought that the physical harm caused by alcohol didn’t manifest until later in adult-hood. Turns out, the neural damage of all that flip cup is readily appar-ent even before you can use your real ID to buy booze.
However, little has been known 
about the effects of combined alco-hol and marijuana use on young developing brains. According to Tapert’s study, alcohol and mari-juana are the two most widely used intoxicants in this age group, and they often go hand in hand. 
The findings of this study may 
be attributed to the considerable presence of cannabinoids — chemi-cal compounds known to protect neural matter from certain types of damage — in weed. 
Proponents of marijuana legal-
ization thus point to the study’s findings as potential proof of the psychoactive plant’s medicinal benefits. Cannabis is currently categorized as a Schedule I drug, alongside the significantly more potent heroin and LSD. A criterion for this most-restrictive classifica-tion is that the substance is not used as a medicinal treatment in the country. However, the United States government holds a patent on cannabinoids for their antioxi-dant and neuroprotectant proper-ties, and medical marijuana is legal in 13 states.
Tapert’s study, publish ed in the 
Neurotoxicology and Teratology science journal, was funded by research gra nts from the National 
Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
The participants were recruited 
from local high schools and col-leges. They were similar in demo-graphic, behavior and mood. The study defined binge drinking as consuming four or more alco-holic drinks on one occasion (five or more for males), while heavy marijuana use was considered to be 180 to 1800 uses in a lifetime — prerequisites that many college students have no trouble meeting. Participants in the control group had little to no history of substance use.
In three of the eight areas of 
the brain examined, the alcohol-marijuana users showed white mat-

it could be seen by thousands of city

Although Rahimi conducted most 
of his research in Tehran, he also trav-eled to the port city of Bushehr and the southwestern provinces of Khuzestan and Lurestan. His work examines the social fabric of the country through interviews, observations and analy-sis. Rahimi, who has discussed his experiences on CNN and in pieces for the New York Times  and Los Angeles 
Times , has been laboring industriously 
to reveal the revolutionary attitude Iranian citizens have adopted. 
“I prefer the grassroots style of 
research because it is mainly about the lived spaces of here and now, ” Rahimi said. “ As a nation of shifting circum-stances, Iran is bustling with identities and individuals that are constantly morphing. ”
This year, the professor is planning 
to teach a course on Iranian cinema — focusing on the country’s political culture within aesthetic mediums of communication — and an installment of Making of the Modern World. The latter will emphasize his specialty: Asian-Islamic history. 
Rahimi’s field research may be on 
pause, but he plans to continue work-ing on a short manuscript planned for release in 2011 and hold lectures on his experience abroad. 
“The key point is how politics, in 
whatever form, is always about a good fight and, usually, there is no clear winner or loser in the game of poli-tics, ” he said.

“Y ou’re dealing with real people 
who, in many cases, have suffered tremendous trauma over the course of their lives, ” Boehm said. “It is inspir-ing to see people who continue to fight for the ideals that once landed them in prison or were the reason that so many people were tortured and killed under Franco’s dictatorship. ”
The summer interviews are con-
ducted with as little interruption as possible. By recording survivors’ 
testimonies, students hope to capture pauses, repetitions and body language.
Many of the graduate students 
abroad also helped excavate the unmarked tombs of political prison-ers in mass grave exhumations. 
The team has collected nearly 120 
interviews so far this summer, and plans to continue its expeditions as long as it can find funding. 
“I hope that somebody will see the 
potential and the importance of our work and decide to help us, because it is very clear that [the project] has captured the interest and the passion of a good number of both graduate and undergraduate students, ” said Martin-Cabrera.

ter that was in significantly poorer 
health than controls. In the other five areas, however, their results were not significantly different than those of the control group. Alcohol-only showed significant damage in all eight areas.
Although research on combined 
alcohol and marijuana use is still emerging, Tapert has high hopes for the study’s findings. As cannabinoids found in marijuana are also present in the nervous and immune systems, she suggests that the potential use of marijuana to protect the brain from other damage may be reproduced with the cannabinoids that occur naturally in the human body.
However, Tapert is wary of 
potential false conclusions.
“I think the key finding has been 
lost in some of the hubbub: that is that young people who did not use alcohol or marijuana had the best quality of white matter in the brain, ” she said in an e-mail. “There are many other risks that make me hope young people think very carefully about cannabis use it diminishes judgment, reaction time and driv-ing ability, and may lead to mood or other mental health problems. ”

were installed to prevent the mind-
less wasting of natural resources.
“We have all low-flow shower 
heads and toilets and sinks, and we’re planning a lot of sustainability education for next year, too, ” HDH sustainability manager Krista Mays said. 
On the green between the 
Village’s low-rise apartments, two bioswales collect rain for water-conserving irrigation. 
As UCSD’s North Campus park-
ing lot is now buried beneath the new transfer-housing complex, most ERC students won’t be able to find a place to park. In its way, this incon-venience will serve as an indirect endorsement of the university’s new push toward sustainability. Without parking, students will have to get used to a more local lifestyle. 
According to Cunningham, 
HDH is doing its best to make this change as comfortable as possible, with efforts such as expanding bike racks and — as planned for Phase II of Village construction — erect-ing a supermarket and satellite bookstore.
John Blakely, who recently trans-
ferred from Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, moved into his apart-ment last Wednesday morning. 
“I thought, you know, I wanted 
to see what the campus was like, so I decided to move in, ” Blakely said. “But I heard parking is an issue. ”
Along with a cafe and 80-seat res-
ervation-only restaurant, Phase II’s main purpose is to ensure a second-year housing guarantee. With more beds across the street, the Village will be able to house next year’s class of transfers while letting this year’s remain in their current apartments until they graduate. 
The Village is part of the univer-
sity’s long-term goal to house a total of 15,000 students on campus — 50 percent of total enrollment.
In other words, the 8 a.m. roar 
of the chain saw out the ERC dorm windows isn’t likely going to fade anytime soon.

The following travelogue describes 
a two-week West Coast tour that my band, Nobody Wave, and my 
neighborhood friends’ band, Pretend, embarked on this summer. It involves debauchery, sleeping on floors, epic 
stretches of open road and an all-

It all began with a show in my 
pal Casey’s garage, filled with old friends and acquaintances from our hometown of Westlake Village. Calbert, Greg and I had prepared for the tour all week, practicing at Greg’s house nearly every day, printing flyers, spray-painting stencils and photocopying hand-drawn posters. We even learned a cover of the Smiths’ “This Charming Man” and dedicated it to our Suburban    Steez

Entering its sophomore year, the Loft  
— located in Price Center East — looks to stay afloat with a fresh round of indie delights for incoming dorm kids and mildly bemused seniors alike. The cafeteria-chic nightclub fancies itself a lime-green ray of fun in the depths of UCSD’s stony abyss, and we’re damn proud of our lil’ dance floor that could. Just like last year, the Loft-Off serves up six nights to commence the quarter, ranging from hip-hop regulars to cinema on the green. If you’re seeking a Welcome Week special that won’t rival the gas bill, look no further. Plus, it gives you an excuse to pregame at International House (as if you needed one).
What better way to prep for the first day of school than by cozying up to a new roomie 
on the lawn? No matter how many times you’ve seen it, Stanley Kubrick’s Cold War comedy “Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb” is a timeless classic 
for any politically inclined, fluid-filled 
individual. Besides, it’s probably a lot more meaningful than it was in middle school, or that one time you watched it with your thoroughly blazed big brother. 
The film will be projected on 
the Price Center East Lawn. But it wouldn’t be an ArtPwr performance without the requisite artsy-fartsy 
lecture beforehand. Catch an elegantly coiffed David Elliot, former movie 
critic for the San Diego Union-Tribune 
and USA Today , leading a discussion 
on nuclear paranoia, Nazi comedy and expressionist staging before the show. Be sure to pack additional snacks for a prescreened Kubrick photo montage, accompanied by synth samples and theremin wobbles from Oceanside punk duo Burning of Rome. Devout fans can also try their luck at the “Kubrick quiz” to win tickets for the upcoming San Diego Asian Film Fest and private screening of “The Sleep Dealer” — a Mexican-made, futuristic mindfuck.
Street violinist Emily Wells is back for a second time at the Loft in all her dreadlocked white-chick 
glory, stringing Vivaldi crescendos onto beat-up Biggie riffs like life was a macaroni necklace. When the 
Guardian  spoke with her last, Wells 
giggled like a schoolgirl at mention 
of her prodigious history (she was 
busy snubbing record labels by the age of 14). She giggled, too, while describing her obsessions with both Suzuki and Tupac Shakur, along with a dislike for unlistenable “art” music. It was hard to imagine that trademark hollowed-out voice emanating from such a cheery girl, chilling her delicate mash-ups of 
banjo, synth and strings.    Fast forward a year, and Wells 
is still honing her Gothic pop scores 
— so-called “symphonies” — in the dimly lit corners of American universities, remaining more an NPR darling than a Top 40 chart-hopper. Her return to UCSD is appropriately opened by intelli-rap duo Portable Payback (we know, they sound like a shitty emo band). Chipped off the now-split Jurassic 5, Soup and Marc 7even partner for some loungy meditation in lieu of debut, Relax . Should be a solid album 
soundtrack for bite-sized food from the Loft’s new Zanzibar restaurant.
It’s not even Week One and your life is already falling apart. Every one of your books is already  out 
of stock at the motherfuckin’ UCSD Bookstore; you can’t understand your professor through his thick Romanian accent; your mom forgot to pay the Fall Quarter bill and you got dropped 
from all your classes. 
It’s okay — sweat it off at the 
Loft’s first dance party of the year, 
in honor of a moonless sky. UCSD’s hip-hop champs 220 Second to None (get it?) will also swing by to perform to the likes of Rihanna and Beyonce. Before you know it, you’ll be booty poppin’ your way to a 4.0. Plus, getting a little too tipsay ain’t 
a problem when your dorm room 
is right next door. Poignant cinema and mini sandwiches are great and all, but take it from us: This kind of midnight frenzy is what makes the Loft sick.
These aren’t your typical UCSD study bores — they can play music, and damn well, too. The 
Luminance club gives local Asian-American musicians a stage by host-ing a talent show for young rock stars at the Loft this Sunday. Singer/songwriter Jane Lui strums haunting originals (highlight: “Illusionist Boy”) as well as a handful of classics like the late-great Jackson’s “Rock With Y ou” . Later Cathy Nguyen takes her covers to a Miley Cyrus-cute, smooth-as-honey level, sometimes even pulling out a Hannah Montana number (we hope she brings along her nimble-fin-gered backup Andrew Garcia). Victor Kim of the Flex Crew then performs 
one-armed breakdance and Filipina 
Michelle Martinez purrs out that kinky hot shit (a la Jeremih’s “Birth-day Sex”).
Get your highbrow fix with Jazz at Lincoln Central Orchestra, performing at the Mandeville 
Auditorium across campus. With a repertoire ranging from Mingus to Sinatra, the 15-piece orchestra is described as a “religious congregation” by its virtuoso messiah Wynton Marsalis, intent on “spreading the word of jazz. ” Sounds suspiciously cultish.
After the show, head back to the 
Loft to catch Oakland hip-hop duo Zion I, loaded with beat-benders from latest release The Take Over (marking 
a decade since their debut.) Familiar faces to the campus, emcee Zion and producer AmpLive catapult from coast to coast, tangling reggae with drum ‘n bass with a touch of trance for a happy raptivism set list that tributes the days of De La Soul.
Spike Lee first got the idea to document tattooed stallion Kobe Bryant when he saw a 
film at Cannes profiling soccer great Zinedine Zidane. Lightbulb the American audience by framing their favorite sport through the eyes of a reigning (if somewhat infamous) 
hero. Turns out the all-star did his 
part in playing the cereal-box mascot, earning an MVP title to crown the director’s latest Afro-centric flick. Stick around for a post screening talk with UCSD Athletic Director Earl Edwards and men’s basketball head coach Chris Carlson.

Screenwriter Robert Siegel (“The Wrestler”) makes 
his directing debut with “Big Fan,” an underdog dramedy shadowing 35-year-old parking garage attendant Paul, who lives at home with his mom and calls himself the “world’s biggest New York Giants fan.” One night, he spots linebacker Quantrell Bishop at a gas station and follows him to a club — but just when Paul ﬁnally gathers enough courage to talk to his idol, he is beaten to a bloody pulp and hospitalized. Oh, the dark and lonely world of a sports fanboy. (JB)“BIG FAN”

Pitbull broke out with “Culo,” where he honed a bumpin’ bassline with rhymes like: “The night is young and if you shave/ I’ll give you some of this mighty tongue (hey).” Now with Rebelution on the shelves, Pitbull slams electrodance over Latin-ﬂavored lyrics, teachin’ the kids how to count in Spanish on “Calle Ocho,” the album’s ﬁrst overplayed single.

CHRISTINA  AUSHANA /GUARDIANBLUE SCHOLARS
The minute I walked onto the 
Street Scene grounds in downtown 
San Diego, I glanced up to find DJ 
Sabzi of Blue Scholars spinning reggae-inspired instrumentals to a modest crowd vibing in front of the Zarabanda Stage. After a few min-utes, Sabzi introduced emcee Geo. The mood changed from chill to intense as the duo lauched into their set, performing songs from their politically charged, organically pro-duced record Bayani . The Scholars 
drew a steady stream of head-nod-ders, silently mouthing the words along with the Seattle-based crew. 
Halfway through the set, the stoic 
atmosphere morphed into an island party somewhere between hyphy and Jawaiian (in Sabzi’s own words, “like reggae, but cuter”) as the pair performed new material off their Oof 
EP . Slow nods gradually gave way to  full-on giggin. As the Scholars fin-ished up, most concertgoers drawn to Street Scene by M.I.A. were left wondering who the hell had just rocked their world for 45 minutes. 
PUBLIC ENEMY
I elbowed my way over to the 
Fula na Stage to catch some of the 
legendary Public Enemy’s set, post-
ing up at the rear of the mob. Most people around me could hardly contain their drunken hysteria over seeing MTV’s Flavor Flav in the flesh, but Chuck D stole the show with his assertive stage presence and raptivism as he followed up a com-manding rendition of “Welcome to the Terrordome” with a rousing speech that could have come straight from his book “Fight the Power. ” The crowd was eating it up. It all could have been mistaken for a bud-ding freedom protest, if the lack of minorities wasn’t so evident. 
OF MONTREAL
After absorbing Chuck D’s wis-
dom, I dip ped out and tried to snag 
a good spot for Of Montreal. Turns 
out that Public Enemy had only just gotten started, but the significantly less wasted Of Montreal fans opted to wait on a tardy Kevin Barnes. Finally, a man wearing a puma mask (guess who?) slinked on stage and the band made its grand entrance behind him. Per usual, the Georgia crew pulled out Bowie-esque the-atrics and called on actors dressed in everything from furry animal get-ups to jumpsuits and gas masks. Meanwhile, lead freak Barnes’ poppy, yet intricate melodies drifted on flawlessly, keeping the Of Montreal faithful content despite the blister-ing heat. 
OZOMATLI
After wandering around aimlessly 
for a bout 20 minutes, catching glimps-
es of sets from the Faint and LA Riots, 
Ozomatli back at the Zarabanda Stage seemed like a good idea. An eclectic mix of big band and hip-hop, salsa and rock, Spanish and English, the octet didn’t disappoint at Street Scene. Each jam marched to a new and dis-tinct rhythm, enough to get even the whitest of folk shaking their hips. 
SILVERSUN PICKUPS
As nothing better was going down 
after Ozomatli’s set, I headed over to 
witness Silversun Pickups rocking a 
colossal mass; unfortunately, they were in the middle of a heated power ballad, interrupting my otherwise nonstop dance party. When they went and plunged into another ballad, I made the educated decision to peace out.Nonstop
Dance Party 
Sweeps the 
SD Streets
BASSNECTAR
In a stroke of luck, I descended 
upon the DJ-of-the-evening Bassnectar just as the long-haired genius was spinning his remix of Rick Ross’ “Hustlin’ . ” No doubt, the man loves his bass. Not only could we feel the super-low tones through-out our bodies, we could watch the rest of the crowd ripple right along with them. It was epic for a while, but there’s only so much heavy low-
end you can handle after a long day 
of hot sets, so I left midway through the 90-minute show.SHARON JONES AND THE DAP-KINGS
Somehow, I had thus far over-
looked the significant number of 
folks over 40 in attendance. They 
became much more apparent when they all congregated to watch Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings close out the Zarabanda — and damn do those old people know what’s up. Watching Jones for just a couple minutes, I immediately found out why she was headlining the Zarabanda — the girl’s got swag, 
and can sing soul better than almost 
anyone from this era. She even brought a middle-aged man from the audience onstage and serenaded him for an entire song, eliciting cheers of approval from the crowd. 
The Dap-Kings weren’t too shab-
by either, backing Jones in typical 
big-band fashion. Gotta love it.
M.I.A.
If anyone forgot that the Beastie 
Boys w ere originally penciled in to 
headline that night, M.I.A. made 
sure to painfully jog our memory. After rapidly shouting the lyrics to several of her songs — a feat she attempted to pass off as rap — she decided to “pay homage” to the absent Beastie Boys by “freestyling” over their classic instrumentals. Truly horrifying. 
Despite ruining timeless beats 
from hip-hop’s most beloved trio, M.I.A. did end the festival on a 
significantly happier note — the 
uber catchy “Paper Planes” was just enough to get the audience pumped for the drive home.

Associate Hiatus Editor
The Burning Plain” opens with a trailer exploding on an empty plain in New Mexico. 
Thankfully, the rest of the film is 
less predictable, although no easier to digest.
In a style reminiscent of his two 
previous hits — “21 Grams” and “Babel” — acclaimed screenwriter and freshman director Guillermo Arriaga proceeds to untangle a sequentially jumbled knot of events that straddles past and present. Repeatedly revealing the effect before the cause, Arriaga asks the audience to sit tight for the first head-scratch-ing 45 minutes as multiple seem-ingly unrelated storylines follow one another in unabashedly disjointed fragments.
We begin in New Mexico, pre-
sumably 10 years ago, where Gina (Kim Basinger), an unhappily mar-ried mother of four, engages in sexual escapades with Nick (Joaquim de Almeida), a married man. Every afternoon, the two sneak away from their families and meet up halfway at a secluded trailer. During one such adventure, the trailer goes up in flames, killing the two lovers.
Flash forward to present-day 
Oregon, where we meet Sylvia (Charlize Theron), a hostess at a swanky seaside restaurant who — despite a glowing exterior that might suggest a healthy, put-together life — spends her free time having meaningless sex with strangers and cutting herself. To top it off, a suspi-cious, unidentified man appears to be stalking her. 
Confused yet? Let’s throw in a blossoming 
relationship between Gina’s teen-age daughter Mariana (Jennifer Lawrence) and Nick’s son Santiago (J.D. Pardo), along with a side riff about an injured crop-duster and his little girl. The result is a near two-hour “Degrassi” episode covering all the tough issues from adultery and plastic surgery to teen pregnancy, self-mutilation and death.
Y es, eventually all the mysterious 
page-turners are explained, but only the most patient viewer will still care after being suffocated by the emo-tional weight of the underdeveloped characters’ failed relationships, betray-als, unrealized dreams and guilt.
The pretty bow at the end doesn’t 
make this melodrama any less unset-tling or morose. While Arriaga is celebrated for his ability to weave a multithreaded plotline by establish-ing continuity between each self-contained short story, he appears to have bit off more than he can chew, often at the actors’ expense.
Theron and Basinger deliver 
when given the opportunity, but sev-eral scenes exhaust their heartrend-ing potential when Arriaga snaps the viewer out of their cinematic trance in order to show off his overused splicing skills.
Save for Robert Elswit’s dreamlike 
cinematography, a distracting flood of bird, scar and window motifs jux-taposed with a blatant orange-versus-blue separation of past and present makes Arriaga’s latest look more like a film-school final than the work of an Oscar nominee.

Your student-loan dollars are burning a hole in your pocket and you’re jonesing for explo-
sions and blood-soaked revenge, but you’ve already seen Tarantino’s “Inglorious Basterds” — is there anything worth ditching the first day of class for?
The good news is that Landmark 
Theaters just started showing “Flame and Citron, ” and it’s almost similar enough to “Basterds” to quench your bloodthirst — but there are some caveats.
For one, the movie’s entirely in 
Danish. 
Set in Copenhagen in the mid-
dle of WWII, “Citron” is the true story of two obsessed resistance fighters, supported by the UK and the Danish government-in-exile, who together kill dozens of col-laborators. But when they realize their cell’s been compromised, their resistance disintegrates into a gory patchwork of revenge and wartime betrayal.
Ruthless pretty boy Flame (Thure 
Lindhardtv — you wouldn’t know him) takes the vendetta-fueled struggle to tear-jerking, brutally emotional heights. On his way to a troop meeting after being wounded, he walks with a jagged step, his relentless gaze hard and cold. The fact that he hardly mellows when femme fatale Ketty (Stine Stengade) enters the picture sets him apart as a man wholly consumed by intense personal strife.
For all Flame’s intensity, though, 
his partner is the film’s strongest character. Citron (Mads Mikkelsen, who you actually do know as Le Cut-n-Paste Novela Flakes into Pile of  Bad Poetry

COURTESY  OF NIMBUS  FILM APSCOURTESY  OF PARAMOUNTor the New Boyz’ “Jerk, ” the sparse 
beats and sneering choreography of those newer limb-flailers certainly borrow the freakishly high energy level made mainstream by hyphy. 
Keak doesn’t exactly have the 
option of trying his luck outside the genre. The raspy, homely rapper holds the high honor of first-ever emcee to use the word “hyphy” on record (thus providing his turn-of-the-century Bay Area hip-hop movement with its official name). Since then, he hasn’t written a single lyric that doesn’t namedrop the movement, and track titles follow suite: “Y adameen, ” “T-Shirt, Blue Jeans, & Nikes, ” “Hyphie, ” “Super Hyphy, ” “E-Y es, ” “Who Started Hyphy, ” “Stunna Shadez On, ” “Go Dumb Go Stupid” and “Hyphy Wifey, ” to name a few. And the list goes on, alongside satisfactorily stranger stuff like “Light Gray Stuff ” and “N Front Y a’ Mama House. ”
Really, he’s a must-have cameo 
on any true-blood hyphy track; without Keak around, who would waddle in with padlock-shaped facial hair to wheeze out a pervy chorus and clammy verse to air out his guttural contemporaries? E-40’s 2006 “Tell Me When to Go” was a culmination of the entire movement (and, though they couldn’t know it at the time, sort of signaled the coming end): All hyphy’s starting players crashed the video, collars a-pop, from Mistah F.A.B. to Too Short to Turf Talk; they talked stupid, dumb, shades, dreads and grills; Lil Jon made sure the classic Bay beat never exceeded the experience of a cheaply cut E trip and would sound just as hot on our shittiest speakers. 
But Keak — who has bragged 
he wrote the “Go” hook in five minutes, which does explain a lot — steals the show, sucking all the oxygen E-40 gasps for and then some, whizzing past his voice box without picking up anything over a squeak, riding it like the metal ball in a tin whistle. Making inner-city and bored university kids everywhere wonder: Maybe if I fry my brain to a crisp with pretty lights and speed-cut happy pills, stuff a couple foxtails up my nose and grunt half-asleep obscenities through it, I too can live the glamorous life of Keak. 
Friday’s free show in Price Center 
Plaza is slated for an 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. time slot — tight fit for a spool as loose as the king of hyphy, who’s 
always been more about mind-numbing quantity than anything short and sweet: His albums are meant to spin on repeat, ensuring the cough-syrup all-nighter don’t end before every last brain cell is good and dead. One goofy trampoline beat zings ceaselessly into the next, high-strung in spandex catcalls and husky hairballs wriggling their way from his raw buzzing 
throat through the brainwaves of a zonked sea of followers. With no signs of stopping.
Keak da Sneak will perform live 
with Millionaires in Price Center Plaza on Friday, Sept. 25.

friend Soaps, who has a thing for Morrissey. Casey’s sealed garage was packed with sweaty folks who helped us get psyched for the 12-show journey ahead. 
After we had stuffed the gear and 
merch back in our cars, the bands 
took a delirious group photo in front of Pretend’s newly acquired econo-van, donated to them by a middle-aged lady friend. They would carry all the equipment, and Nobody Wave (plus our party-animal roadie Ranj) would follow in a whip of our own.
The next 
morning, I filled a school backpack with clothes and toiletries — enough to get me through a week, tops. Around 2 p.m., Greg, Cal and Ranj showed up with our loaner ride, a fairly new Honda Accord. Greg’s dad had a business associate named Jose, a “developer, ” who got us the car, no questions asked. We cruised over to Vons for some road snacks and cheap eats (pasta, cereal, fruit) and then hit the 101 toward UC Santa Barbara. 
That night’s show took place on 
a patio overlooking the ocean, with a sign reading “Danger Cliff ” on the fence behind us. Despite the thick mist and fog rolling in — soaking our gear as we played — the show was a success, with drunken friends arriving in caravans to see us off. We said our final goodbyes and crashed at Ranj’s new apartment after some late-night talk over bowls of said cereal and Super Smash Bros. 
Eleven heads passed out on the 
carpeted floor in personal mummy bags. 
We slept in late, called dibs on 
showers and wolfed down breakfast burritos at Super Cucas before heading out of Isla Vista and up the coast toward San Luis Obispo. A group called DIY SLO was putting on the day’s epic Mountain Show, but we were a bit nervous about it even happening at all, considering the shadiness of their instructions: We were told to “meet at the gazebo” of a local park, so we could all carpool up an unmarked road off the 101 to the top of a rustic mountain, where we would play. 
Rad, in theory. Sadly, those who came to watch 
us were crusty punks who mostly just wanted to drop acid as the sun went down. Our audience couldn’t care less about the music, but beggars can’t be choosers, so we took two weirdos in our car and Pretend took the other two. One of them threw up on the curb before climbing in. 
When we got to the mountain 
road, we knew it wasn’t going to happen. The Honda kept bottoming out as we dipped into pothole after pothole. The econo-van fared even worse, stalling only a quarter of the way up. Matt, the show’s promoter, said that of all the mountain shows they’ d ever done, only one band’s van had ever broken down. Hard to believe, as this was the worst road I had ever driven on. 
We decided it wasn’t worth it to 
risk the whole tour for one weird show, so we let the crusty dudes out and turned back. To salvage the rest of the night at our friends’ condo in SLO, they prepared us a pasta and chicken feast. We bonded over Soul Calibur marathons, budget beer and our favorite: OG local band Respira. 
“We’re Nobody Wave, and there’s 
nobody here, ” Calbert said behind his drums as we stood in the back of Streetlight Records, surrounded by vinyl. We had driven from SLO to Santa Cruz, and were passing out flyers on Pacific Avenue and waiting for Pretend to show up in the van. They had brought it to a repair shop that morning and were stuck until the mechanics finished. Luckily, Streetlight gave us some slack and we let us start over an hour late. 
The record shop was empty aside 
from a handful of people browsing. One bored older man across the store decided to count off one of our songs, so I guess he was into it. Afterward, we gorged ourselves at an Indian food buffet to keep up morale after this series of setbacks. Later that night, we’ d be playing another house show at my good friend Stephen’s place nearby. 
Did the cops turn up? Did homies 
even show? Had we made a huge mistake, eating all that Indian food right before? Find out next week in Part II.

Dear Members of the UCSD Campus Community: 
 
As you are aware, excessive alcohol consumption poses a threat to our students and the community in 
which they live.  In an effort to minimize problematic drinking we are collaborating with community leaders to ensure that our students are aware of their responsibilities when hosting or attending social 
gatherings.  We also want to remind them of their duty to protect the safety and wellbeing of their 
guests and neighbors.  Starting this Fall 09, we will work towards reducing the risks associated with drinking in the following ways:

  Party Patrols: campus and city police will increase their patrols in neighborhoods 
surrounding the campus. 
  Compliance Checks: campus and city police will increase efforts to make sure retailers who sell alcohol are doing so within the limits of the law (i.e. checking ID, not serving/selling 
to underage customers, not over-serving customers, etc.) 
 
 DUI Checkpoints: campus and city police will jointly facilitate more sobriety checkpoints 
near the campus and throughout San Diego. 
 
By this time, we all know about the tragedies that can result from unwise choices around alcohol, and 
that alcohol abuse is a serious societal problem.  Together, we can make our campus and local 
community a fun and safe place to live and socialize responsibly.  We are very proud of the nationally acclaimed programs we have to educate and raise awareness on our campus, and the fact that most 
UCSD students make healthy choices.  But mostly, we are proud of YOU, the students and members of 
the community.  Let’s all make a commitment to our collective responsibility, and work together in 
continuing to keep our campus safe.  If you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to 
contact Lupe Samaniego-Kraus at (858) 534-3874.

LA has seen a glut of Smell bands rise from the 
dregs of downtown loft shows to blog prominence — and HEALTH is a noise-glam standout. 
The foursome melted faces in 2007 with their self-
titled debut, finding a balance between all-out squall and spastic post-punk. They even tried their hand at throwback dance remixes on HEALTH//DISCO in 2008, 
from which they borrow aural cues on sophomore release, Get Color . 
Lead single “Die Slow” pulses like any good acid 
techno track should, but guitar tones expand to bump and grind in detached, sterile fashion, creating a repul-sive sexual undertow. In a self-directed clip for the song, supermodels march like coked-out fembots while a mass of bodies writhes in its own blood, the group’s performance driving the spectacle to new levels of gross. While Get Color  finds HEALTH using guitar texture 
and gritty feedback, the group remain within their prescribed genre box, rarely straying from the ghostly vocals and drumline beats that first got them noticed. 
Still, on “Eat Flesh, ” wonky chords culminate in a 
more hypnotic and structured whole, as Jake Duzsik’s voice lulls in and out of focus. “We Are Water” lends kraut-rock repetition to a dance-arena buildup, giving HEALTH their first genuine anthem complete with climax and resolution. 
Bringing up the rear is minimalist techno track “In 
Violet, ” unnaturally subtle and surprising coming from noisy dudes like these, showing a willingness to tinker with their steez on albums to come.

Fitting snugly into the blogger-fueled trend of combining the most obscure genres possible — new wave to chill-wave, lo-fi to no-fi to glo-fi — South Carolina nobody 
Ernest Greene mashes ’80s cheese into New Age pads and gobs of reverb for the Washed Out bedroom project. After amassing buzz with just a seven-inch single and a cassette tape, Greene has finally come through with the Life of 
Leisure  EP , available only in digital and vinyl formats. 
The six-song release operates on the same level as retro-
chill contemporary Neon Indian, never straying far from the predictably innocent sound palette that gets Scottish duo Boards of Canada so much play. Cuts like “New Theory” pair bassy 4/4 beats with a teenage wistfulness, leaning heavily on unintelligible vocals and bargain-bin-vinyl production. Greene fuses it all together in a way that’s unoriginal yet somehow inspiring, showcasing his timeless tastes on his 
sleeve without venturing too far into the unknown. 
But then comes “Feel It All Around, ” a track so damn 
immediate and pleasing, a honed breath of shoegaze and mini-mal disco bathed in fuzz — a track that doesn’t have to explain itself. The message from the like-minded collection of no-fi musicians is clear: fun in the sun, sound quality be damned. 
Greene’s songs end unexpectedly, which might be a delib-
erate aesthetic choice, now that it’s hot to sound like shit. A song like “Y ou’ll See It” revels in its worn-tape mix fading in and out, and awkward Casio presets somehow feeling again. 
Washed Out may just be the next musical contradiction 
to get its junk washed by the online community, but Life of 
Leisure ’s pop melodies seep through the self-imposed murk 
to at least make the trend a pleasant one.

Electro-Punk Fashionistas Are T oo Busy 
Looking in the Mirror to Rock OutSouthern Comfort Stays Close to the Sunny Side of  New-Wave Pop TrendsCharacter-Driven ‘Citron’  
Dragged on By Daily Grind
Chiffre in the new “James Bond”) 
teeters so dangerously on razor’s edge between self-pity and mental derange-ment that he makes the audience uncomfortable. His fumbling attempts at keeping his family together are so inept that one can’t help but feel a tad embarrassed — then gradually horri-fied — as he ultimately resolves to let his loved ones drift beyond his final grasps.
This isn’t a typical kill-’ em-all war 
drama — no happy balance of fam-ily and fighting emerges in the end, and extended scenes of gratuitous street violence are entirely neglected. Rather, this is a true-story movie (at least, never having shot Nazis in occupied Europe myself, it feels true). The direction is never heavy-handed, and most of the tension is found in quieter moments rather than in shouting matches or dra-matic camera angles. As a result, the story, the situation, and the actors themselves take center stage — with-out benefit of a stirring score or overt foreshadowing.
For all that, though, “Flame and 
Citron” never quite crosses into gotta-have-it territory, for one simple rea-son: It’s not engaging. The characters are surely compelling, but let’s face it — intricate character development is only captivating at a soap opera’s pace. Without adrenaline-pumped action or any semblance of humor, the film rapidly deflates (such is the fate of many a slow-moving, subtitled arthouse flick). 
Hate to say it, but if it’s a question 
between going to your first class and throwing down a ten-spot for this one, you might actually want to grit your teeth and sit through the lecture.

"Visit wellness.ucsd.edu for information on
living a balanced and healthy lifestyle. "ing, as well. Samra had an up-and-
down season last year, playing well through the first half but struggling later in the season. 
Okasaki and Samra will be joined 
by junior-college transfer Richard Morris in the No. 3 spot, and sopho-mores Mike Tilghman and Mike Neustadt in the fourth and fifth posi-tions, respectively. With four of the top five players returning from last season, head coach Mike Wydra is optimistic heading into the season.
“Based on the quality 
of play this summer, we will be much improved this year, ” Wydra said. “They have all played in a variety of amateur tour-naments, starting with the U.S. Open Qualifying tournament. Our players had low rounds in big tournaments, which is a good indica-tor of how they’ll play throughout the year. ”
Wydra has no doubt that returning 
the No. 1 and No. 2 men along with adding Morris, will give the Tritons a competitive edge in what is arguably the toughest region in the nation. Last season, teams from the West Region finished first, second and sixth at the NCAA National Championships, with Sonoma State winning the national title.
“It’s such a tough region that just 
hanging around would be pretty good, ” Wydra said. “But in the infa-mous words of Ben Crenshaw before the final day at the 1999 Ryder Cup, I 
have a good feeling [about this season]. ”
Wydra’s hopes will be 
tested against a stellar field at the WWU Invitational. The Tritons look to improve on last year’s sev-enth-place finish against a field that includes reign-ing national champion Sonoma State. In each of the past three years, UCSD has steadily bettered its previous year’s finish.
Against such top com-
petition, Wydra said he has a few tricks concealed. Wydra’s tactics revolve around his players’ mind-
set within their group.
“They need to refuse to lose to 
anyone in their group, ” Wydra said. “One player can’t affect the overall war. But if each of our players can win his battle within his group, then we as a team can win the war. ”
Readers can contact Matt Croskey at 
mcroskey@ucsd.edu.Cerritos College, and the Triton team’s efforts were enough to earn the overall victory.
“So far, Brian’s done a real nice 
job, ” Garcia said. “I think he’s really well prepared so far. ” 
Following the sea-
son opener, the Tritons traveled to Irvine to compete in the Asics/UC Irvine Invitational on Sept. 12. Senior Mike Wright led the Tritons to a sixth-place finish out of 21 teams on the men’s side, finishing 32nd indi-vidually with a time of 26:09.0. Schofield led the women to the eighth spot with her fifth-place individual finish at 17:45.0. 
“She’s definitely 
much more comfort-able with the sport, ” Garcia said. “Last year was her first year run-ning cross country, and she is ahead of where she was last year at this time. We’re really excited about the rest of the season. ”
Schofield was named the 
California Collegiate Athletic Association Female Runner of the Week on Sept. 14. In her freshman campaign last season, Schofield finished 22nd in harsh conditions at the NCAA Division II National Championships, and was named an All-American. 
The start of this 
season also marks the return of senior Dan Anderson, who missed all but the first few races of the team’s 2008 campaign due to injury. Anderson finished 19th out of a field of 37 run-ners in Irvine, compet-ing in his second race in almost a year. 
The Tritons can 
only hope that having a healthy Anderson will catalyze the team.
UCSD looks to 
continue its success-ful sprint out of the gate at the Southern Indiana Pre-National Invitational on Sept. 26 
in Evansville, Ind. against  teams from all over the country.
“We’ve had a real good start 
to the season, ” Garcia said. “We’re pleased with where we’re at and we have great returning talent as well as freshmen.
Readers can contact Janani Sridharan 
at jsridhar@ucsd.edu.the season as one of UCSD’s four captains.
UCSD started the year on a posi-
tive note, thanks in part to McTigue’s strong play.
In its season opener on Aug. 
29 against Central Washington, McTigue gave UCSD a 2-1 victory with her game-winning score dur-ing double overtime, one of her team-high four goals of the season. McTigue also has eight points, tied for the team lead with freshman midfielder Jessica Wi.
“It’s not ever about being the 
leading scorer, ” McTigue said. “It’s about going out there as a team, working together and trying to get a win. ”
Head coach Brian McManus 
— now in his 23rd season at the helm and owner of the third high-est winning percentage in NCAA women’s soccer history — sees a common denominator among McTigue, Wi, and the entire team, which he said will preserve the team’s success.
“They all have good skills, excel-
lent reading of the game and a desire to do well, ” McManus said.

After an embarrassing first-
round defeat to Cal State Los 
Angeles in last season’s NCAA West Regionals, this year’s squad has shown its determination to make up for last year’s early exit. Displaying a resilience that the Tritons hope will define them this season, UCSD knocked off the very same Cal State Los Angeles team on Sept. 19 in a thrilling five-set match.
“We had some tough losses last 
year, ” head coach Tom Black said. “ And after those, the team just made a commitment to themselves. This year, they’ve all been on the same page, and our dedication has really improved our play. This is one of the best teams that I have seen here. ”
The only blemish so far for the 
Tritons — who won their first 10 games of the season — came on Sept. 11 when they took their first loss in four sets to second-ranked Cal State San Bernardino. UCSD will get a get a chance for revenge against the San Bernardino Coyotes on Oct. 17, playing this time in front of the home fans. 
“We’re determined, ” senior outside 
hitter Sylvia Schmidt said. “We’re aiming a push for the championship. We’re excited for another year, and everyone is working hard to get there. ”
UCSD, who has not made it to 
the NCAA National Championships since 2006, will return home for the start of Fall Quarter to host a pair of weekend matches on Sep. 25 and Sept. 26 against Chico State and Cal State Stanislaus, respectively. 
Readers can contact Tyler Nelson at 
tcnelson@ucsd.edu.The Tritons took their first and 
only loss of the season in front of a whopping 1,796 fans at Cal State Stanislaus on Sept. 18. A late defensive leak led to a comeback victory for the CSUS Warriors, sparked by junior forward Victor Regalado  — the cur-rent California Collegiate Athletic Association scoring leader. 
UCSD senior defender Daniel 
Pavitt led the Triton attack by notch-ing his first career goal on a free kick from inside the center circle in the game’s 15th minute. Senior goalkeeper Peter Akman anchored the defense with six saves. 
After outshooting the Warriors 
15-6 in the first half, CSUS retook the game’s momentum in the second half.
Regalado — who has scored eight 
goals in the Warriors’ first seven games — single-handedly led his team to a comeback. The game-winning goal came in the 90th minute, as Regalado rebounded a teammate’s free kick and shot it past Akman. 
The Tritons suffered their first loss 
after back-to-back 0-0 ties at Cal State Monterey Bay and San Francisco State on Sept. 11 and Sept. 13.
 Throughout the season’s first 
eight games, UCSD has shown a very strong defense backing an underde-veloped and dormant offense. 
“So far, we’ve really been working 
hard and playing as a team. We’ve been scoring goals by moving the ball around and have brought in a lot of new contributing players that have done really well, ” senior keeper Akman said. “We’ve been playing really well defensively and will soon see a flurry of goals being scored on offense. ”
Inexperience at the collegiate level 
has not proven to be an obstacle to the 2009 Tritons, as Pascale has given his new crop of freshmen a significant amount of playing time. 
“It’s great to see that we have 
such a deep bench and that anyone can step up to the plate when called upon, ” Akman said. “The bench is vital and can really support the team and push us forward. Coach Jon pushes the team on and off the field, and leads by example. He pushes us to really fight and play with energy — especially the older players. ”
Looking for their first conference 
winof the season, UCSD travels to Cal Poly Pomona on Sept. 25, before heading to Cal State San Bernardino on Sept. 27.
Readers can contact Cameron Tillisch at 
ctillisc@ucsd.edu.Hendrick said. “Everything I did, he did 
— he always aspired to be like me, but sur-passed me in every way. ”
The brothers shared the same high-
school record in the sport: 15 feet 4 inches.
Roach’s teammate, sophomore Allison 
Rudd, described him as an “incredible teammate and friend with the most amazing character, work ethic and positive attitude. ” 
Rudd was also Roach’s bible-study part-
ner. 
“He was so confident that when he 
would die he’ d go to heaven, and had such a hope in the fact that god had a greater plan and a calling for his life, ” she said.
In a 2001 study, the American Journal 
of Sports Medicine ranked pole vaulting as having the highest death rate per partici-pant of any sport. 
In 2002, 19-year-old Penn State student Kevin Dare died in a pole-vaulting accident after suffering serious injuries to the head. Dare’s father tried to make the sport safer for athletes by helping design and market the first helmet made specifically for pole vaulters. 
“Leon wouldn’t have wanted helmets to 
be required, ” Hendrick said.
Mary Ann Roach emphasized the fact 
that she is not blaming anyone for the acci-dent. 
“We hold no hard feelings toward UCSD 
or the coaches. Leon loved everyone down there, ” she said. 
Three UCSD track-and-field coaches 
declined to comment on the exact nature of the drill Roach was performing at the time of his death.

The two wins against tough 
Eastern opponents reflect the team’s off-season productivity.“This off-season we worked on 
creating a very efficient counter-attack offense and defense, ” Roberts said. “Wearing down teams is the mentality UCSD brings to every game. ”
The Tritons look to ring in the

existing systems in place that attempt 
to close the performance gap, but nei-ther MLB’s system of revenue sharing nor its “luxury tax” come anywhere close to creating equal competition. Revenue sharing stipulates that each of the 30 teams must fork over 30 per-cent of their profits to be distributed evenly amongst all teams, but there is no requirement that this money must be spent on players’ salaries. This cre-ates a giant loophole that has allowed numerous owners to pocket millions by deliberately keeping their salaries down. 
In 2003, the smaller-market 
Florida Marlins won the World Series with a respectable payroll of $54 mil-lion. That team was built around a mix of veterans and budding stars that included Josh Beckett, Mike Lowell, Brad Penny and Ivan Rodriguez. Instead of retaining these players and making a run at more titles, Marlins ownership dismantled the team through free agency and trades, enabling its payroll to drop all the way down to $14.9 million in 2006, nearly 20 percent of the league average. Doing so qualified Florida to receive a league-high $31 million in revenue-sharing dollars, not a cent of which went to fielding a more talented team, but instead made up the majority of its MLB-best $43 million profit in 2006.
Baseball’s second system is the 
competitive balance tax (aka the “lux-ury tax”) a stipulation just as flawed as the first. This places a tax on team payrolls that go over a preset ceiling that changes every year, but which is set so high — $162 million for the 2009 season — that it realistically only applies to baseball’s top-two spending teams, the New Y ork Y ankees and the Boston Red Sox. 
If baseball’s primary check on team 
inequality promotes greedy ownership, and its secondary check only impacts a fraction of the league, how can the majority of teams ever have a realistic shot at becoming competitive? 
The fact that seven different teams 
have won a World Series since 2001 — none of them being the dreaded Y ankees — is a step in the right direc-tion. But the fact that only two of those teams, the ’01 Diamondbacks and the ’03 Marlins, can be considered small-market shows that revenue shar-ing has less to do with seven different champions in eight years than Bud Selig would have us think. 
Only by implementing a salary cap 
can baseball hope to see more teams in competition late in the season — teams that have have a real shot at winning. The type of “hard cap” used in other professional sports makes it so that teams cannot spend over a set amount on team payroll. The NFL sets its hard cap at $128 million per team while the NBA holds their team sala-ries to a mere $59 million a year. Each of those leagues has seen its share of dynasties in the recent past, but they have also taken the important first step of limiting the lavish spending that has come to define baseball in the Scott Boras era of free agency. The fact that Barry Zito signed for $126 million is evidence enough to create a salary cap.
Imagine if the Y ankees couldn’t 
sign Mark Teixeira for the absurd amount of $180 million, and he instead signed with his hometown team, the Baltimore Orioles. Or if, instead of taking $161 million to play in New Y ork pinstripes, CC Sabathia re-signed with the Milwaukee Brewers and led them through another playoff race. With just those two examples, you bring one dominating team slightly back down to earth while two underperforming clubs receive a much-needed boost. 
The reality is that most teams will 
not be in contention come September of any given year. Does this mean that fans, players and all 30 teams don’t deserve at least a fighting chance? Y ankees President Hank Steinbrenner, who — at the helm of the world’s rich-est ball club stands to lose the most from any changes — said this about revenue sharing and a salary cap: “That’s a system I don’t particularly like. It’s a socialist system, and I don’t agree with it. Is it even American?”
Well, Uncle Hank has put it in its 
simplest form: Y ou’re either a true American patriot who wants to let the free market determine who wins a World Series, or you’re a Fidel-loving, Molotov-throwing commie who wants more competitive equality. Well then, comrade, pour yourself a shot of vodka and grab a seat on the couch, because the game’s about to start.

How the 
Little Guy Can Win Again
F or the entire month of 
September, there has been a grand total of one race for any 
of the eight playoff spots. Even then, the one “legitimate” playoff race has been for the National League wild card, where (and it kills me to admit this) the San Francisco Giants’ anemic offense has been working overtime to try and make even this one existing race irrelevant. 
While playoff games in October 
might reveal which teams have supe-rior talent and an actual chance to win a World Series, September is the time for the second-, third- and even fourth-place teams to keep dream-ing a bit. Before magic numbers can be counted on one hand, and while a third of the league is still separated by five games in the wild-card race, September is normally the month in which most teams have something to play for. 
For as good as the current month 
should be, there is a slight hitch: This September has been about as inter-esting as sitting through a Pirates-Nationals doubleheader. The eight teams that currently hold playoff berths are exactly the same teams that led their respective divisions a whole month ago, engendering a month of — for what it’s worth — meaningless baseball games.
Why is it that nearly two-thirds of 
major league teams find themselves with nothing to play for with over a fifth of the season left? How come certain teams find themselves in contention year after year while other teams have been written off since the first day of spring training?
The complete lack of parity in 
baseball stems largely from the huge gap in spending between the fewer, wealthier teams and the remaining poorer ball clubs. OK, so any orga-nization where the minimum salary is 400K a year can hardly be con-sidered proletarian, but baseball has the ability to make September —and consequently the season as a whole — interesting and competitive again by creating a much more level playing field. 
How to do this? Simple: Institute a 
salary cap.
Unlike its stepbrothers in the NFL 
and the NBA, Major League Baseball has no salary cap, meaning that any team can spend as much as it is capable in order to field a team. But this is America – the land of oppor-tunity, one might say – where any person has the potential to defy his or her surroundings and rise to capital-istic glory. Does this belief carry over into baseball, the official pastime of 
the American dream? Under its cur-
rent system, Major League Baseball has created so much financial and structural disparity that lowly teams like the Kansas City Royals and the Washington Nationals have, in reality, about as much a chance of winning the World Series as a poor, strug-gling family of five has of receiving 
adequate health care from President 
Obama.

Holding high hopes for another 
promising season, the UCSD 
women’s volleyball team has begun Fall Quarter by scaling the national rankings with a 12-1 record. A third of the season already behind them, the Tritons now look forward to playing before full stands of stu-dents drawn to RIMAC Areana by Welcome Week activities and events.

Despite a large proportion of incoming freshmen 
players, the 2009 UCSD men’s soccer team has quickly jumped to a 3-1-4 record. Goals have been scarce since their Sept. 4 season kick-off, but team chemistry and resulting victories have begun to pick up for the Tritons and second-year head coach Jon Pascale. 
Facing Chico State on Sept. 20., the Tritons initially 
got on the board thanks to a first-half goal from fresh-man forward Evan Walker and stingy goalkeeping from Akman for a 1-1 tie. Despite being their fourth draw in only eight games, the game versus a difficult Chico State squad showed a resilience that Pascale hopes will define the 2009 season.
“We’ve been faced with a lot of adversity these last 
few weeks, but we’ve remained in good spirits and have played real well, ” Pascale said. “We felt like we were the far better team [against CSUS],  but couldn’t score goals. ”

As the defending California 
Collegiate Athletic Association champions, the UCSD women’s soccer team has a lot to live up to. After winning seven of the last eight conference titles, the team was picked to win the CCAA in a preseason coaches’ poll. 
Similarly, UCSD was ranked 
18th in the nation by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America before a single game ball had been kicked. 
High expectations aside, this 
year’s squad has generated a buzz by accelerating to an impressive 5-1 record.
With such a rich tradition of 
conference dominance, the Tritons hope to build on past success in 2009. Asked about her team’s aspi-rations for the new season, senior midfielder Alexia Zatarain put it simply: “To go to the final four and repeat as CCAA champions. ” 
Zatarain is the only senior on 
a team that has traditionally relied on a solid veteran core. However, sophomore forward Sarah McTigue has already been a major contribu-tor for the Tritons and is an exam-ple of the younger Triton players who have stepped into productive roles.
With two goals and seven 
assists in her freshman season, McTigue finished the season tied for second on the team in scoring, with 11 points. As a result of her strong performance, she began

The No. 17 Tritons head 
into their annual first-day-of-school match against No. 5 Loyola Marymount University with last year’s close loss to the Lions still fresh on their minds.
UCSD won two out of its 
four games at the Northern California Tournament at Stanford University Sept. 19 and Sept, including a 6-5 loss to LMU in the opening match. 
Falling behind 5-2 after 
three quarters against the Lions, UCSD scored three goals in the fourth period, but was unable to overcome the early hole.
The Tritons bounced back 
with an 8-7 win over No. 10 Concordia University, then split their Sunday games, fall-ing to No. 9 Cal State Long Beach before rebounding to beat No. 18 UC Davis. 
Prior to the tournament at 
Stanford, the Tritons traveled to Maryland for three matches on Sept. 11 and Sept. 12. In a classic matchup of West Coast versus East Coast, the Tritons performed well, posting back-to-back wins over George Washington University and John Hopkins University before dropping a hard-fought, 11-10 overtime decision to the Naval Academy.

Coming off a successful 2008 
seasons the UCSD cross country team jumped back into action earlier this month to start the new campaign. Last year, the Tritons came close to seizing both conference crowns, but the men’s and women’s teams both found themselves beat out by Chico State. This season, the Tritons are hoping for better results.
“Both teams have a goal of 
remaining in the top three teams of the conference, ” head coach Nate Garcia said. “Last season, the men placed second in con-ference and the women placed third. At the very least, we want to hold our position. Each year is a little bit different, but we want to stay in the top three and work from there. ”
Leading off the new season 
at home, the Tritons swept the UCSD Opener on Aug. 29. On the women’s side, sophomore Bre Schofield continued last year’s trend by winning her first race of 
the year, this time beating out all 
competition in the 2.5-mile race. 
The Triton women recorded 
faster times than their oppo-nents from Point Loma Nazarene University, San Diego Christian College, Sonoma State University and Cerritos College for the win.
Although the UCSD men 
did not field the top individual 
winner, the Triton harriers took 
five of the top six spots, with freshman Brian Knight leading the way. Knight’s time of 22:52.7 was just three seconds behind first-place Jason Zapien from Early Season Results Show
