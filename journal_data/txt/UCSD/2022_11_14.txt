Thousands of UC Aca -

Strike Demanding Higher

/T_his article is part of our ongo -
ing coverage of the 2022 academic 
workers’ strike. 
/T_housands of University of 
California academic workers be -
gan striking on Nov. 14 across 10 
campuses, demanding fair con -
tracts and higher pay from the 
UC, in accommodation with the 
increased cost of living.
Starting late October, the 
United Auto Workers union 
(UAW 5810, UAW 2865, and 
SRU-UAW), which represents 
48,000 academic workers such as 
TA’s, post-docs, graders, tutors, 
and academic researchers, held 
a 10-day authorization vote for a 
multi-unit lawful strike, with 98% 
of their 36,558 members voting 
“Yes” to authorize a strike. /T_his 
is the largest and most decisive 
strike authorization vote taken by 
UC academic workers.
“/T_his [vote] really sends the 
message to the UC, that we’re 
united, and we’re ready to hold 
them accountable,” /f_i/f_th-year 
doctoral candidate Maddie Wil -
liams said. “What we’re /f_ighting 
for is for people to be li/f_ted out of 
the rent burden across the board 
with that minimum increase in 
salary.” 
UAW outlines in their housing 
proposal that the current starting 
minimum income for teaching 
assistants or student researchers 
is $23,246.50 for one academic 
year — or $2,583 per academic 
month — constituting only 30% 
of the San Diego Area Median 
Income and falling under the cat -
egory of “extremely low income.” 
Given the high in/f_lation this year, 
UC’s originally proposed wage 
change would even cause a 5% 
real wage decrease.
“Our working conditions 
are o/f_tentimes also the research 
conditions for people’s PIs or su -
pervisors,” Williams said. “And 
the quality of education that we 
are able to provide, as well as the 
quality of research, is compro -
mised because we’re struggling to 
make ends meet.” Williams also 
serves as a representative in the 
teaching assistants’ bargaining 
team UAW 2865.
UAW surveys show that 92% 
of graduate student workers and 
61% of postdocs spend more than 
30% of their gross income on 
housing, exceeding the federally 
established aﬀordability limit. 
UC-owned housing is not a prom -HUMAN MILK INSTITUTE
UC San Diego Establishes World’s First Human Milk 
Institute
By Mehri Sadri /gid00004/gid00016/gid00015/gid00021/gid00019/gid00010/gid00003/gid00022/gid00021/gid00010/gid00015/gid00008/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
UC San Diego has founded a Human Milk In -
stitute, a monumental eﬀort to study human 
milk’s scienti/f_ic properties and its clinical 
care implications, develop an eﬀective and safe milk 
banking system, and cultivate educational impacts 
for individuals on both a local and global scale. /T_he 
facility is acknowledged as the /f_irst human breast-
milk research institute in the world and will be used 
to bene/f_it infants, new mothers, and others.
Renowned UCSD physicians and scientists now 
are exploring the potential capabilities of breast 
milk, which until now has only been utilized for in -
fant healthcare. /T_he HMI is led by Founding Direc -
tor Lars Bode, Ph.D., concurrently a professor of pe -
diatrics at UCSD School of Medicine, whose focus is 
to transform researchers’ approach to analyzing and 
utilizing the nutrient-rich substance. 
“With the novel, comprehensive approach of the 
Human Milk Institute at UC San Diego,” Bode said, 
“we have an opportunity to learn, coordinate and in -
teract in a single, go-to place, and be able to speak 
with one voice.Research can inform clinical care, 
clinical care can inform research and both can help 
educate.”
/T_he establishment of a dedicated institute al -
lows researchers to conduct scholarly discourse and 
operations more eﬃciently, providing synthesized 
and data-backed evidence to address the many un -
answered questions pediatricians and patients cur -
rently have regarding human milk. According to UC San Diego TODAY, some of these critical questions 
include whether “components of human milk can 
be developed into natural therapies or serve as non-
invasive diagnostics” or if it can be used to treat adult 
health conditions such as heart attacks, strokes, can -
cer, diabetes and obesity.
According to Bode, doctorates, physicians, and 
scientists have been doing this work for a while, but 
progress suﬀered from a lack of collaboration. /T_hus, 
the HMI intends to combine work from UCSD’s re -
search institutes, clinical care centers, and education 
departments. Entities such as Larsson-Rosenquist 
Foundation Mother-Milk-Infant Center of Research -
er Excellence, the UC San Diego Health Milk Bank, 
UCSD’s Department of Pediatrics, and the Altman 
Clinical and Translational Research Institute, are 
also included to “improve the lifelong health of all 
people through human milk,” said doctorate faculty 
member Christina Chambers. 
Paired with UCSD’s successful eﬀorts in research -
ing /f_indings regarding breast milk, including its 
potential prevention of food allergies and ability to 
possibly transmit COVID-19 from mother to child, 
scientists such as Chambers look forward to further -
ing such eﬀorts and positively impacting human 
health in an established setting. She remarked that 
“the HMI will bring us together in unprecedented 
ways to support our monumental eﬀorts in discov -
ering how human milk can help people of all ages.”

San Diego, only 13% of postdocs 
and 14% of academic researchers 
can secure housing.
According to second-year 
Postdoctoral Fellow Adam Ca -
parco, a higher base rate doesn’t 
make postdocs’ life easier; as he 
explained, “postdocs are of an age 
where we could be starting a fam -
ily — we’re not really in school 
anymore — we think about 
things like infertility bene/f_its and 
dependent care structure.”
Caparco also shared that post -
docs usually have fewer health -
care bene/f_its compared to other 
units, and what they’re trying to 
do is to “get closer to what they 
should be paid.”
Caparco has been involved in 
the bargaining process for over a 
year. Meanwhile the UC has not 
created a transparent and fair 
bargaining environment but in -
stead “broke the law for negotiat -
ing.”
“/T_he university is undermin -
ing the good faith in negotiations 
by providing a band-aid to placate 
a small group of people, instead of 
actually improving the working 
conditions for everyone,” Capar -
co explained. “/T_hat’s not accept -able for negotiations.”
UAW is currently demanding 
$54,000 and $70,000 as the annu -
al base rate for all graduate work -
ers and postdocs, respectively. 
/T_he UC, as the biggest employer 
in California, has a $46 billion 
annual budget. Even if all pro -
posed compensation requests are 
ful/f_illed, it constitutes less than 
3% of the total budget, as pointed 
out by Williams. 
Aside from their inability to 
implement fair compensation, 
UAW alleged that UC campuses 
have failed to meet their legal 
obligations, including creating a 
transparent negotiation process. 
“/T_he cross-unit strike [is 
meant] to compel [UC campuses] 
to bargain fairly, remedy its un -
lawful con/f_lict, conduct, and help 
settle a fair contract,” Williams 
said. “/T_here is no end date set for 
the strike, but the University can 
at any point choose to stop their 
unfair labor practices and bar -
gain with us fairly. It’s really in 
their hands.”
When asked if the strike 
would potentially disrupt under -
graduate learning, Williams re -
sponded, “it is worth a long-term 
improvement to everyone’s expe -rience at UC. I would also say that 
not every teaching moment hap -
pens in a classroom. When we’re 
being treated unfairly, it’s up to us 
to use the power of the collective 
to our ability, and come together 
and speak up against the power.”
In response to this potential 
UAW strike, UCSD Vice Chan -
cellor Simmons released guid -
ance regarding the continuity of 
research, noting that UCSD “re -
spects the rights of represented 
employees to bargain collectively 
… and to perform legally protect -
ed strike activities.”
Fourth-year doctoral candi -
date Sam Ridge, who is also the 
philosophy department strike 
captain, requested faculty mem -
bers to pause in-person classes 
to respect the picket lines. Mean -
while, not all teaching staﬀ have 
announced accommodations 
with respect to the strike period.
“/T_he oﬃcial stand from some 
other departments or individual 
faculty members is only doing 
what they’re legally required for 
the legally protected strike, but 
will not do more than that,” Ridge 
said. “I’ve heard from some grad -
uates in other departments that 
their faculties don’t even legally respect students’ rights to strike. 
What that means is that people 
are retaliating against participat -
ing in unfair labor practice- or 
strike-related activities.”
Aside from fair compensation 
in adjustment to the increased 
cost of living, UAW’s Core De -
mands also include sustainable 
public transit for climate protec -
tion, support for working parents, 
and international scholar rights. 
As of this story’s publication, ar -
ticles including Grievance and 
Attribution and Respectful Work 
Environment reached tentative 
agreements.
UC released an oﬃcial re -
sponse, stating that “UC believes 
its oﬀers are generous, responsive 
to union priorities, and recognize 
the many valuable contributions 
of these employees … [and] UC 
is committed to continuing to ne -
gotiate in good faith and reaching 
full agreements as soon as pos -
sible.”`
More information regarding 
picket lines and bargaining up -
dates can be found on UAW’s of -
/f_icial website. 
UC San Diego School of Med -
icine’s Translational Neurosci -
ence Institute made their latest 
breakthrough in the treatment of 
spinal cord injuries a/f_ter the cul -
mination of 30 years of research. 
In a paper published on Aug. 22, 
a team of researchers led by Dr. 
Mark Tuszynski used rats as a 
model to /f_ind that STEM cells 
could signi/f_icantly impact the re -
habilitation and repair of injured 
spinal cords. “It’s very challenging to try 
and regenerate the injured spinal 
cord; the central nervous system 
doesn’t regenerate naturally very 
well,” Tuszynski said. “Axons are 
not typically capable of regrow -
ing when they have been cut. 
But there have been some recent 
breakthroughs that have been en -
couraging, and one of them is the 
use of stem cells.”
Researchers chose stem cells 
as a treatment due to their regen -
erative and fast-growing proper -
ties, a notable contrast from the 
slow-growing adult nerve cells, according to Tuszynski. He noted 
that stem cells are able to redevel -
op a substantial amount of axons 
compared to regular nerve cell 
counterparts. 
“Before using stem cells was 
that we achieved the growth of 
about 100 axons for a distance 
of one millimeter through the 
injured spinal cord. And now 
with stem cells, the stem cells 
will extend 10s of 1000s of axons, 
or distances of 50 millimeters,” 
Tuszynski said.
In the experiment conducted 
by Tuszynski and his colleagues, the spinal cords of rats were ex -
posed and damaged to simulate 
the eﬀects of a spinal cord injury 
in humans. Half of the injured 
rats then received an injection of 
stem cells in the area of the dam -
aged spinal cord. 
A/f_ter inducing the injury, the 
researchers waited one to two 
weeks so that the stem cells sur -
vive better once they are implant -
ed. Tuszynski said this will be im -
portant to keep in mind once theyUCSD School of Medicine Finds STEM Cell Rehabilitation

UC Announces Flu Vaccine Mandate for all Students and Faculty Amid Rising 
of Influenza and COVID-19 Cases Across San Diego County
By Niloufar Shahbandi
/gid00015/gid00006/gid00024/gid00020/gid00001/gid00006/gid00005/gid00010/gid00021/gid00016/gid00019
/T_he University of California 
issued a Flu Vaccine Mandate for 
students, faculty, other academic 
appointees, and staﬀ who are liv -
ing, learning, or working on cam -
pus. /T_he mandate was announced 
via email on Nov. 8, and UC San 
Diego has set the compliance date 
for receiving or aﬃrmatively de -
nying the vaccine as Friday, Nov. 
18.
/T_he mandate arrived amidst rising COVID and in/f_luenza in -
fections across San Diego Coun -
ty. /T_here have been 5,471 /f_lu cases 
and 91,933 COVID-19 cases in 
the county in the period of July 3 
to Nov. 5.
Unsurprisingly, /f_lu cases have 
more than quadrupled compared 
to previous years, likely as a result 
of lax masking and social dis -
tancing guidelines in 2022. /T_he 
/f_lu season usually lasts between 
October and March of each year. 
Currently, there are seven dif -
ferent strains of in/f_luenza across 
the county, with In/f_luenza A be -
ing the most common among re -
ported infections. 
San Diego public health oﬃcer 
Dr. Wilma J. Wooten told KPBS 
of the potential eﬀects of a wide-
spread /f_lu outbreak. 
“We have reason to believe 
that respiratory illnesses could be 
extremely disruptive in the region 
this year for businesses, hospitals, 
and people’s lives,” Wooten said. 
“San Diegans must do their part 
to prevent the spread of these ill -
nesses.”
Nationally, cases are also on 
the rise. /T_he Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention estimates 
that there have been 2.8 million cases of the /f_lu so far this sea -
son, with 23,000 hospitalizations 
and 1,300 deaths. /T_he CDC web -
site also states that an annual /f_lu 
vaccination is the most eﬀective 
method of protection. 
On-campus masking policies 
are set to change beginning Dec. 
16, to make masking optional in 
classrooms, labs, and on UCSD 
transportation, but public health 
experts continue to recommend 
masking in indoor spaces to min -
imize the transmission of respira -
tory diseases. 
Flu vaccines are free of charge 
for students regardless of their in -
surance coverage. Failure to com -ply with the vaccination mandate 
may result in students being re -
ported to the Oﬃce of Student 
Conduct, where the student com -
pliance team may oﬀer advising 
for students to adhere to the Uni -
versity’s policies.
To schedule your vaccination, 
please visit MyStudentChart. If 
you wish to decline the vaccine by 
the Nov. 18 deadline, the 2022-23 
/f_lu vaccine declination form can 
be found on the online version of 
this article at ucsdguardian.org.

need to operate on humans. 
 “And that’s also the most 
clinically relevant way to think 
about translating this technol -
ogy to humans, because most hu -
mans wouldn’t undergo surgery 
to repair the spinal cord imme -
diately… they would be stabilized 
medically /f_irst,” Tuszynski said.
A/f_terwards, the rats under -
went a rehabilitation technique 
involving them reaching, grab -
bing, and grasping for food in 
order to repair their motor func -
tion. Both the control group and 
treatment group underwent these 
rehabilitation tasks and had their 
motor abilities documented. Fol -
lowing the rehabilitation period, 
the stem cell treatment yielded 
signi/f_icant improvements. 
“/T_he control injured rats lost 
about 75% of their ability to re -
trieve the food rewards. And the 
rats that received rehabilitation, 
and a stem cell implant, regained 
about 50% of their function. It 
was a signi/f_icant improvement 
compared to the untreated rats. 
For Tuszynski, the trial results 
represent signi/f_icant progress in 
addressing spinal cord injuries 
in humans, where rehabilitation 
and therapy are typically the 
only means of treatment. For in -
dividuals disabled and impaired 
by spinal cord injury, this could 
signi/f_icantly improve their qual -
ity of life. “/T_his means if you had a hu -
man with a cervical spinal cord 
injury, and you’re trying to im -
prove hand function … they 
could reach out their hand, put 
it around a glass or fork and be 
able to bring it to their mouth and 
feed themselves,” Tuszynski said.  
“It might mean that if they can’t 
control a hand control for a mo -
torized wheelchair, now maybe they can reach out to that hand 
control and be able to control the 
wheelchair themselves. It would 
be extremely valuable to get even 
that degree of recovery, because 
right now, there’s nothing.
Tuszynski anticipates human 
trials would begin in two years, 
with an eventual goal of stem cell 
treatment being medically avail -
able for all patients.

Bibi’s Back
“You better damn well report 
to Bibi that we’re still buddies.”
Addressing the Jewish Fed -
erations of North America in 
November 2014, then-Vice Presi -
dent Joe Biden was stuck between 
a rock and a hard place. News of 
negotiations over the Joint Com -
prehensive Plan of Action, more 
commonly known as the Iran 
Nuclear Deal, had become public, 
and relations between the Obama 
administration and Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin “Bibi” Netan -yahu’s government deteriorated. 
Netanyahu’s already poor opinion 
of Obama and his allies had sunk 
further, with the Prime Minister 
reportedly having “written oﬀ” 
the administration and commu -
nicating with the Republican-led 
Congress instead. /T_he Obama 
administration, meanwhile, had 
opinions of Netanyahu ranging 
from “reactionary” to “pompous” 
to even “chicken [s---].” /T_he most 
common complaint was that Ne -
tanyahu acted as the “mayor of 
Jerusalem” rather than the prime 
minister of Israel; they criticized 
his focus on short-term goals and pleasing his political base rather 
than trying to solve Israel’s many 
problems and leave a legacy of 
leadership.
Biden, however, had always 
had a more positive relationship 
with Netanyahu. Despite their 
numerous disagreements, he was 
usually the emissary-of-choice 
when the Obama administration 
required a message to be deliv -
ered to the Israelis, and Biden was 
considered by Netanyahu to be a 
greater friend of Israel, and some -
one with a greater understanding 
of the Middle East than Obama. 
Eight years later, Biden is now U.S. president, and Netanyahu 
has staged a political comeback 
for the ages, being returned to 
power by a larger than expected 
margin amidst numerous scan -
dals. Netanyahu’s return compli -
cates the Biden administration’s 
relations with Israel; Biden’s pre -
decessor Donald Trump built a 
signi/f_icant amount of goodwill 
with Netanyahu, including mov -
ing the U.S. embassy from Tel 
Aviv to Jerusalem, recognizing it 
as the capital of Israel in violation 
of international norms. Biden 
has spent most of his presidency 
so far striving to build a working relationship with Yair Lapid, the 
current prime minister and lead -
er of an anti-Netanyahu coalition 
that includes both the Arab le/f_t  
and the far-right. Netanyahu’s 
re-entry means that the budding 
peace process must be re-started, 
and Netanyahu’s views on Pales -
tinian leaders (calling them pro -
ponents of “ethnic cleansing,” for 
example) make it unlikely that 
the Palestinian Liberation Orga -
nization will come to the table, or 
that Netanyahu would even want

to negotiate if they did. 
`/T_his is not to say that Netan -
yahu has never compromised. 
/T_he Abraham Accords with the 
United Arab Emirates and Bah -
rain were a signi/f_icant accom -
plishment, creating cultural ex -
change programs between these 
two Muslim nations and the 
Jewish state of Israel. /T_here were 
economic motivations as well, es -
pecially with the UAE looking to 
diversify its economy, but the Ac -
cords have helped set a framework for normalization in the Middle 
East. A similar deal may be loom -
ing with Saudi Arabia, a strong 
indicator that Arab nations in the 
Middle East are considering pri -
oritizing the economy and mod -
ernization through trade deals 
rather than a religious/spiritual 
boycott of the state in support of 
their fellow Muslim Palestinians. 
/T_his presents an opening for 
Biden, not only to push for an 
Israeli deal with other Middle 
Eastern nations but to potentially use such deals as leverage to force 
Israel to sit down with the Pales -
tinians. /T_his, however, would rely 
on Middle Eastern nations coop -
erating with the U.S. to withhold 
support for Israel; considering 
the recent U.S.-Saudi oil dispute, 
such tag-teaming seems unlikely. 
Biden’s personal relationship 
with Netanyahu will therefore 
be the deciding factor in how his 
administration works with Israel. 
Previous warm ties can help him 
push Netanyahu where Obama /uni25B6 BIBI’S BACK , from page 4
couldn’t, but an emboldened Is -
raeli right-wing might not be so 
keen to negotiate. Biden must 
approach the Israel issue with an 
open mind, enticing Netanyahu 
and his government with poten -
tial economic gains but still en -
suring that Palestinian interests 
are represented. At the very least, 
the U.S. must make an attempt to 
re-start the /f_lagging peace pro -
cess and initiate a new dialogue 
with a Netanyahu who might be 
more focused on leaving a legacy now that his political future is less 
murky. /T_he future of the peace 
process remains uncertain, but 
one thing is clear: it all hinges on 
Netanyahu. 
Follow Apollo
Here’s a controversial take: 
Representation matters. Omar 
Apollo puts this on full display as 
he has come to embody the voice 
of a generation of young, queer, 
and latine folx. His /f_irst full al -
bum “Ivory,” as well as rumors 
of that album being based on an 
ex-relationship with fellow artist 
Frank Ocean, have a lot of people 
talking about Apollo’s star power. His meteoric launch is in large 
part to his openness about his 
identity, genre-spanning prowess, 
and stellar personality, meaning 
that he’ll likely stay in orbit even 
“En El Olvido.” 
Apollo has been asked several 
times whether or not he puts a 
label on his queerness. His re -
sponse in an NPR interview was 
very telling, as he asks “do I really 
come oﬀ like that?” and identi/f_ies 
that, in the beginning, “I was try -
ing to be mysterious and stuﬀ, but now I’m just like — I’m very gay.” 
Personally, it’s very refreshing to 
hear an artist speak openly about 
their sexuality. Although it’s their 
right to have privacy, many artists 
use the absence of a label in ways 
that, intentional or not, queer -
bait their audiences. For Apollo, 
“coming out” as queer takes pow -
er away from people who question 
or attach a label to him. Apollo’s 
openness with his identity and 
music resonates with an audience 
of young people who are o/f_ten starved of authenticity in in/f_lu -
encer and celebrity culture. He is 
not afraid to represent queerness 
for other people and fosters queer 
joy even in melancholic melodies. 
Omar Apolonio Velasco was 
born in Northern Indiana to par -
ents of Mexican immigrants from 
Guadalajara. He comes from a 
Catholic family, and as a queer 
person in this environment, he 
struggled with his identity and 
used dance and music as his out -
let. He began dancing at the age 
of 11 and started learning how to 
play the guitar at 12. He began 
pursuing music in 2017 with his 
mixtape “Apolonio.” He followed 
this with two EPs, “Stereo” and 
“Friends,” as well as his “Live at 
NPR’s Tiny Desk” (my personal 
favorite), and most recently “Ivo -
ry.” As his career has progressed, 
many artists have recognized his 
trajectory, and he has worked 
with the likes of Pharrell Wil -
liams and Kali Uchis. His music 
represents a mix of many styles 
and traditions, ranging from sad 
boy pop to traditional ranchera 
style. His falsetto voice has been 
compared to Prince, and he takes 
inspiration from Whitney Hous -
ton, Kanye West, Nirvana, and 
Lauren Hill. His fusion of Span -
ish and English, his wide range 
of sounds, and his upbringing 
re/f_lect that he contains multi -
tudes. /T_he contradictions and 
intersections of his identities are 
mirrored in his music. His sound 
is reminiscent of so many of the 
greats in diﬀerent /f_ields, his life 
story is relatable to so many, and 
yet he stands out as singularly 
unique. /T_he more speci/f_ic, and 
obscure your identity is, the more 
it can be universally relatable. Ev -
eryone can /f_ind themselves in the 
real, human passion that Apollo 
represents.  
I went to see Apollo perform 
at San Diego State University with 
Roger Revelle College sophomore 
Katherine Jamison. She described 
his sound as “the vibe to end all 
vibes.” I had introduced her to his 
music a few weeks prior, and we 
both fell for his sound. Katherine 
and I have been to a fair few con -
certs, but as she puts it, “he really 
stands out. You could just tell that 
he is meant for a bigger stage.” 
She felt “lucky that [she] saw him 
so early in his career; he’s clearly 
just getting started.” We are both 
obsessed with his Spanish music 
and /f_ind it funny that we met each 
other in Spanish class and now 
bond over his beautiful meta -
phors en español. 
Apollo’s music resonates with 
people of many backgrounds 
and musical interests. Assistant 
Professor of Ethnic Studies and Core Faculty for Critical Gen -
der Studies Program, Roy Pérez 
was also impacted by Apollo’s 
performance, remarking that 
“Omar Apollo is really going to 
be among the great queer rockers 
and crooners, and it’s a thrill to 
watch his career take oﬀ.” 
Pérez spoke about what Apol -
lo’s work represents for him, add -
ing that “as a gen-xer, I feel like 
he’s the patron saint of queer 
Latinx coolness I barely dared to 
wish for in my teens.” 
Even with how monumen -
tal his work is, Apollo still feels 
grounded and down-to-earth. 
Pérez echoes this sentiment, in 
that he “can’t overstate how pow -
erful it is so see such a talented, 
openly queer Chicano musician 
get so much visibility and praise. 
His work and his success are just 
profoundly moving to me.” 
Even though most of his dis -
cography revolves around un -
requited queer love, listening to 
Apollo somehow feels like a re -
ciprocated win.
Starting from Indiana, Apollo 
is becoming a world-renowned 
performer. In concert, he gave 
one of the best performances I 
have ever seen. I hope that his 
relatable, unique contradictions 
propel him further to the fame he 
is due. Apollo represents so much 
and stands for so many. He inter -
sects with so many people’s iden -
tities, allowing people to resonate 
with his music. /T_his is why rep -
resentation matters. We deserve 
Omar Apollo, and he deserves the 
world.

Peer Navigator at the Student 
Veteran Resource Center and se -
nior Stephen Vaughan says he has 
found a home and community at 
UC San Diego and the SVRC, 
albeit through a non-traditional 
journey. A/f_ter serving in the 
Navy for four years, he le/f_t at the 
end of 2018 and attended com -
munity college in Los Angeles for 
the next two years. Vaugh notes 
that the Post-9/11 GI Bill was 
helpful; his tuition is covered, 
and he receives some direct de -
posit money for rent. 
Vaugh transferred to UCSD 
last fall quarter and recalls there 
were still a lot of COVID-19 re -
strictions in place, especially in 
campus centers like the SVRC. 
Vaugh was therefore not in -
volved with the SVRC during his 
/f_irst few quarters here, until his 
friend—a fellow veteran he had 
met in class—brought him there. 
“He was going to get coﬀee, 
and it turned out to be a busy day. 
/T_here were other students [at the 
SVRC], and I hadn’t even been 
in here before, so that was in -
triguing,” Vaugh told /T_he UCSD 
Guardian. “It’s nice, you know, 
having our own area to study. 
Once I started coming in, I pretty 
much didn’t stop.”’
Vaughn became a regular at 
SVRC (a subdivision of the UC -
SD’s Student Success Programs), 
and when he was approached 
by the program manager at the 
time to apply for a job there, he 
took him up on the oﬀer. Vaughn 
notes that students working at the SVRC do so through the Vet -
erans Aﬀairs (VA) work-study 
program.
“/T_here’s an immediate con -
nection [at the SVRC], especially 
among the veterans,” Vaugh said. 
“So the conversations just kind 
of /f_low a little easier, and a lot of 
us here are a little bit older than 
some of the other [students] and 
have had diﬀerent journeys get -
ting here to this university, and so 
I think that commonality makes 
people more comfortable with 
each other.” 
At the SVRC, Vaughn’s su -
pervisor is Antonio Del Pozo, the 
Interim Program Specialist. Del 
Pozo explains that there is one 
Program Manager and one Pro -
gram Specialist (him) working at 
the SVRC along with six student 
workers, who are all either Cen -
ter Operations Personnel or Peer 
Navigators. 
/T_he SVRC has an oﬃcial mis -
sion statement, but in Del Pozo’s 
words, they are a “center which 
supports, has resources, and acts 
as a place of transition for not 
only our service members and 
veterans, but everybody aﬃliated 
with the military — that may be 
spouses or children of veterans, 
active duty service members, or 
people currently in ROTC (Re -
serve Oﬃcers’ Training Corps). 
And so our center connects our 
patrons to resources. [/T_he SVRC] 
is mainly an area where we pro -
vide a place for them to gather, 
study, and help them along with 
their transition.”
Del Pozo notes that they have 
partnerships with many diﬀerent 
organizations on campus such 
as Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), Oﬃce of Stu -
dents with Disabilities (OSD), 
and liaisons with the /f_inancial aid 
oﬃce and registrar’s oﬃce, which 
handle the processing of federal 
and state bene/f_its for students. 
On a typical day, Vaughn says 
that regulars come in to get their 
coﬀee and study, while others 
drop by to ask questions about 
housing, veteran bene/f_its, and 
more. He usually directs these 
people to resources that will help 
them resolve their issues and 
gives new faces a tour of the cen -
ter — pointing out the couches 
and bookshelves, the quiet study 
area, the meditation (or more 
aptly named, nap) room, and the 
counter with snacks and a coﬀee 
machine. 
/T_he SVRC also does events pe -
riodically; for instance, Vaughn 
mentions that last month, they 
coordinated with the Triton 
Transfer Hub to do a 25+ mixer at 
Dirty Birds. 
Vaughn says that, although 
the pandemic put a stop to many 
of the activities the SVRC could 
do, he feels like this quarter, they 
are /f_inally starting to go back to 
pre-pandemic levels of commu -
nity and activities. 
“We’re getting more and more 
people coming in,” Vaughn said. 
“We’re just growing the com -
munity, and that takes time, but 
I think we’re doing a good job of 
fostering that growth.”
In terms of goals, Del Pozo 
hopes to continue moving in the 
direction of being more inclu -
sive and improving visibility and 
outreach. He wants the SVRC 
to become more well-known 
throughout campus and hopes to continue providing opportunities 
and support for students within 
the UCSD community, as well as 
the greater San Diego area.
“Come around the center,” Del 
Pozo said. “It’s a pretty warm, in -
viting atmosphere; we’re very ac -
cepting of whoever wants to come 
here. I know [that] sometimes 
there might be a stigma [around]

TV Review: “Y oung Royals” Season 2
When Net/f_lix announced the renewal of “Young Royals” a/f_ter the success of the /f_irst 
season, I had my doubts. It was not going to be easy following the immaculate and well-
executed /f_irst season of Wilhelm (Edvin Ryding) and Simon’s (Omar Ruderg) love story. 
/T_he /f_irst season was near perfection, and I was fearful that Season 2 was not going to be 
able to deliver the same quality. 
I’m so glad my fears were put to rest. Season 2 was everything I wanted it to be and 
more.
For those who are unfamiliar with the masterpiece that is “Young Royals,” the show 
is about Prince Wilhelm who is forced to transfer to a prestigious boarding school. He 
forms a romantic bond with Simon, a fellow student, but their developing relationship 
is challenged by politics, family relationships, and the overwhelming anxiety of being 
young, queer, and in love. 
Season 1 le/f_t us oﬀ with so many questions. How will Wilhelm adjust to being Crown 
Prince? Will Simon forgive Wilhelm for betraying his trust? Will Simon and Wilhelm 
/f_ind their way back to each other? 
Fortunately, Season 2 was able to answer these questions while staying on the emo -
tional rollercoaster that made the /f_irst season so memorable. /T_he portrayal of Wilhelm’s 
anxiety and the way he copes with the pressures of being Crown Prince was touched 
upon in Season 1, but in this season particularly, we get to witness his struggles manifest 
into anger and self-destruction. Wilhelm was determined to get revenge on his cousin 
August (Malte Gardinger) for leaking the intimate video of him and Simon. While it was 
obvious that he was spiraling slightly, it was so euphoric to see Wilhelm enter his villain 
era and /f_ight for what he wanted. 
Still, his battle with anxiety came with ups and downs; Ryding did a remarkable 
job conveying every emotion Wilhelm was experiencing. When Wilhelm felt broken, I 
felt broken; when he felt hopeful, so did I. /T_he portrayal of emotion was infectious, and 
through this, Ryding was able to be the main conductor of the emotional rollercoaster 
that is this show. 
/T_he pacing of this season was de/f_initely faster than the last, which allowed for more to 
unfold and for the climax to be more chaotic and eventful than the previous season. /T_he 
number of twists and turns this season le/f_t me emotionally exhausted by the end of it. Ep -
isode 6 by itself was such a whirlwind of emotions, I found myself pausing all throughout 
the episode just to let myself have time to process the events as they happened. Let me tell 
you, Wilhelm, for lack of a better term, popped oﬀ during the last episode. His character 
development was spotlighted, and it was impossible not to cheer him on. 
/T_he introduction of the love triangle was taxing to see. I had invested so much energy 
into Simon and Wilhelm’s relationship and to see another love interest for Simon get 
introduced was infuriating, to say the least. Although Marcus (Tommy Wättring) was 
supposed to be presented as a perfect partner to Simon in contrast to Wilhelm’s pressure-
induced indecisiveness, he felt manipulative. Simon has always and will forever be a fa -
vorite of mine, but I just wanted to slap some sense into him and tell him that Wilhelm 
is the love of his life. 
I also felt like this season did an amazing job creating parallels from Season 1, espe -
cially during the scenes when Marcus asks Simon the names of his /f_ish and when Wil -
helm /f_inally closes the curtains. /T_his season managed to give the fans exactly what they 
were looking for in a second season without feeling like it was constantly doing fan ser -
vice. /T_he six-episode season makes us want more, but I think that’s part of the reason the 
show has been able to specially curate each episode in a very intentional way. It’s limited, 
RAYMOND TRAN  /gid00014/gid00002/gid00015/gid00002/gid00008/gid00010/gid00015/gid00008/gid00001/gid00006/gid00005/gid00010/gid00021/gid00016/gid00019
it’s personal. It’s part of the show’s charm. 
Ryding and Rudberg have an undeniable chemistry that translates into their char -
acters with such ease. /T_here was such a complex mix of emotions between Wilhelm and 
Simon in every scene. We could feel their deep-rooted love for one another without any 
words being spoken, but we also can see their hesitation to go all in and why they felt 
this way. /T_hese actors absolutely nailed the body language and nuanced behaviors of the 
characters. /T_hey were born for these roles. 
My only grievance with the show is that Felice (Nikita Uggla) felt sidelined this sea -
son. Although her friendship with Wilhelm was amazing (we are not going to talk about 
the end of episode 3), that’s all she was this season — a best friend. /T_he exploration of her 
character has the potential to go so much deeper, and I think it was a missed opportunity. 
While I am sure that this was intentional, I had another major issue with this season: 
Simon’s sister, Sara (Frida Argento). It was actually impressive how infuriating and an -
noying Sara was this season. In the /f_irst season, she was a somewhat likable character, 
but her development this season de/f_initely took a turn for the worse. Her actions were 
sel/f_ish, and her relationship with August, the person who has done nothing but torture 
her brother, ended up coming back to bite her — as it should have. Admittedly, Sara and 
August were a cute couple though. For a split second, I was hoping that they would be 
able to help each other become better people, but the end of the season le/f_t much to be 
desired from both of them. 
While this show is obviously very unrealistic, the raw emotion on the screen was 
so captivating. I think “Young Royals” does more than typical queer representation in 
media. /T_he show is obviously about a gay love story, but there is such depth to both the 
lead characters that being queer wasn’t the main con/f_lict of the story; rather, it was just a 
facet of the bigger con/f_licts much like it is in real life. /T_here has also been a theme regard -
ing the politics and social standings of Sweden, where the show takes place. /T_he struggle 
that Wilhelm endures as Crown Prince and the lifestyle that Felice and August live are 
juxtaposed with Simon and Sara’s lower social standing, commenting on the political and 
socioeconomic issues of Sweden. As Sara /f_inds out, the class diﬀerences are stark and ap -
parent. Wilhelm, being pressured by his mother to /f_it into a particular mold, comments 
on the priorities of the Crown. When he begs her to “just be my mom,” it’s heartbreaking. 
/T_he critique of power and wealth takes on many forms throughout the show, and it can be 
seen through the school’s hierarchy, Royal pressure, and even during the gi/f_t exchanges 
on Sara’s birthday. /T_he political commentary, while it may be easy to skip, de/f_initely add -
ed a layer to the show in terms of its representation and purpose. 
“Young Royals” will forever have a place in my heart, not only for its phenomenal 
queer storytelling but also for its ability for me to feel seen, even in this wild story about 
a Prince and his charming boyfriend. 
Net/f_lix has yet to announce Season 3 of the show, but if, god forbid, it gets canceled, I 
will cry, scream, and march to Net/f_lix headquarters to riot (in that order). 
Here is where I insert my obligatory statement about how incomprehensibly attractive 
Edvin and Omar are. Merry Christmas to both of them.

a New Jersey DJ, when he was 
performing with Yung Bae dur -
ing the “Continental Groove” 
tour, and I absolutely fell in love 
with his stage presence. I couldn’t 
get enough of the energy that he 
brought on stage, and I knew I 
had to see him again. /T_hus, when 
I saw he planned to perform in 
Downtown San Diego’s /T_he Mu -
sic Box, I was ecstatic. /T_his now 
leads me to ask...
Have you ever been inside a 
mystical forest before? And no, I 
don’t mean going inside a forest 
while on—*clears throat*—illicit 
substances. Well, I have, since 
that’s the best way to describe Fla -
mingosis’ show on Nov. 12. From 
start to /f_inish, with both openers 
included, the entire experience 
felt like I was being taken on a 
journey through a fantastical for -
est.
Every fantasy forest needs 
some sort of cheery, fun gate -
keeper that opens the gates of 
imagination for travelers, and 
Ehiorobo, the opener, was that 
gatekeeper. I had never heard of 
the New Jersey artist before com -
ing to this show, but he sure le/f_t  
a lasting impression on me. His 
style combines aspects of R&B with Soul and EDM to make one 
of the most unique listening ex -
periences I’ve had in a live show. 
Although I didn’t know any of the 
lyrics to his songs—besides his 
closing song where he coached 
us through the chorus—his up -
beat music combined with his big 
smile make you want to dance 
alongside him. /T_his energy re -
minds me of the forest gatekeep -
er; he makes you want to dance 
and run along with him. A/f_ter his 
set, I was expecting a continua -
tion of this style of upbeat music, 
lights, and visuals, but not every 
forest can be bright all the time.
Everyone knows that a mysti -
cal forest also needs a dark, scary 
section of the forest to strike fear 
into the hearts of travelers, and 
Blockhead, a New York DJ, em -
bodied this. I knew there was go -
ing to be a shi/f_t in tone from the 
opening visual that Blockhead 
displayed. It read: “WARNING: 
/T_he activities depicted in this 
video are strenuous and highly 
physical in nature. /T_hey should 
not be attempted without /f_irst 
consulting your doctor.” Despite 
this, I still could not have antici -
pated what followed. Blockhead’s 
style of music was still EDM, but 
used hip-hop samples and had a 
darker tone, best captured by his 
accompanying visuals. /T_he screen 
behind him glowed with images Concert Review: Flamingosis

the air, psychedelic cartoons, old 
WWII-era training videos, N64 
Doom gameplay, and heavily dis -
torted footage of old /f_ilms rang -
ing from various decades. All the 
visuals evoked a sense of decay 
and dread that perfectly captured 
his style of music. Especially at 
the start of his set, it felt like I was 
entering the darkest part of the 
forest. However, towards the end 
of his set, he began to joke around 
that he would be playing a couple 
of sillier, lighthearted songs, one 
of which sampled Fleetwood 
Mac’s “Dreams.” It was at this 
point that it felt like the dark part 
of the forest was beginning to end 
and make way for the reward for 
travelers who stuck through.
/T_hus, /f_inally, a/f_ter a quick in -
termission, Flamingosis made 
his way to the stage. If Ehiorobo 
is the entrance gatekeeper and 
Blockhead the dark section of 
the forest, then Flamingosis is 
the beautiful lake surrounded 
by trees and shining bright un -
der the sun. He was a wonderful 
change of tone and pace and ab -
solutely kept the energy high all 
night. I know, throughout the ar -
ticle, I’ve been using the analogy 
of the forest, and while I think it 
best captures the overall nature 
— pun intended — of the show, 
I think Flamingosis is due for his entirely own analogy. Although I 
have listened to Flamingosis on 
and oﬀ since I discovered acts like 
him and Yung Bae in 2017 and 
did enjoy his music, I could never 
/f_ind the right word to describe it 
all, but this show has helped me. 
Flamingosis is the embodiment 
of the vibes I associate with sum -
mer. His personality and stage 
presence is fun and outgoing, 
especially during songs in which 
he comes to the front of the stage 
and dances for the audience. His 
music is easygoing, very warm in 
tone, tropical at some points with 
Latin in/f_luences and samples, 
and funky at others as he also 
uses disco samples in some of his songs.
Prior to this show, had you 
asked me what kind of music 
Flamingosis makes, I probably 
would’ve said future funk. At the 
time, I still associated him with 
artists he previously worked and 
performed with. However, put -
ting that label on Flamingosis 
would sell him short, and his show 
demonstrates the vast stretch and

My Love Letter to Super Smash BrosShould You Dye Your Hair?
By Viggo Kovas
/gid00004/gid00016/gid00015/gid00021/gid00019/gid00010/gid00003/gid00022/gid00021/gid00010/gid00015/gid00008/gid00001/gid00013/gid00010/gid00007/gid00006/gid00020/gid00021/gid00026/gid00013/gid00006/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019Ah, the age-old question. As 
someone who has recently dyed 
her hair, changing it from black 
to blonde to pink in the past six 
months, I would say that dyeing 
your hair is a great way to keep  
things fun and interesting. But it 
de/f_initely is not for everyone. Be -
low, I outlined the usual thought 
process I go through every time 
I dye my hair. Hopefully it helps 
you decide what you want to do, 
and whether you decide to stay 
natural or change it up, I am sure 
you will make the right decision.
So, /f_irst things /f_irst. Why are 
you dyeing your hair? Maybe you 
think you’ll look good in another 
color. Maybe you want to switch 
things up. Or, maybe you feel 
some sort of ongoing inner tur -
moil that can only be /f_ixed with a 
drastic change in appearance. For 
the /f_irst two, I would say go ahead! 
Now or never! But for those of 
you who may relate more to the 
third option (which, to be honest, 
is probably most of you), you can 
change your hair but you cannot 
change your problems. I will not 
tell you no, but I think you will 
/f_ind that a diﬀerent color is just 
that: a color. It is not a solution. 
If you’ve decided to not dye 
your hair, stop here. Come back 
another time. 
Next, choose a color. /T_here 
are a lot of questions that people 
say you should ask yourself before 
you commit to a color. What looks 
good with your skin tone? Y our 
eyes? Y our wardrobe? What hair 
color is in right now; what color 
is out? Do you want to stand out? 
Or are you more of a blend-in 
type? While all of these questions 
are valid, there are really only 
two questions you need to know 
the answer to: what color do you 
want, and what color will your By SAMANTHA PHAN
/gid00013/gid00010/gid00007/gid00006/gid00020/gid00021/gid00026/gid00013/gid00006/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
hair allow?
What I mean for the /f_irst ques -
tion is that it should not matter 
what matches, what other people 
are wearing, or what is cool. Y ou 
should choose whatever color you 
want. Regardless of whether that’s 
a muted brown or a bright green, 
as long as you want it, you should 
dye it. /T_he only other constraint is 
what color is actually possible. If 
you have black hair, a bright green 
might be a diﬃcult transition. But, 
if you can /f_igure out how to do it, 
I say go for it. 
Another great thing to know 
is how long you want the color to 
last. Maybe you only want a tem -porary dye that lasts a few weeks. 
Or, perhaps you are hoping it’ll 
last forever. Really think about it 
and, remember, you can dye the 
hair again once it fades, but if you 
make it permanent, it may be hard 
to go back. 
Now you have to choose a sa -
lon or a DIY tactic. A salon would 
probably be more reliable; there’s 
less of a chance of you frying your 
hair oﬀ or it coming out green 
when you wanted purple. But you 
should also be prepared for a he/f_ty 
price. Hair coloring, at the cheap -
est, is going to be at least one hun -
dred dollars. Y ou will probably 
pay more if you need your hair bleached so, for all my fellow dark 
haired friends out there, good 
luck. /T_his is one of the rare cases 
where blondes do actually have 
more fun. 
Tip: If you go to the salon, try 
to get a consultation and a price 
estimate before you schedule the 
actual color appointment. 
Do not get me wrong, dyeing 
your hair yourself will be cheaper, 
but that doesn’t mean that it is bet -
ter. Y ou have to do research about 
what hair dyes will work best for 
your hair, and whether you need 
bleach, developer, or toner. Y ou 
also have to understand color 
theory and what combinations will give you the results you want. 
Without these, your dye job may 
not end up the way you wanted it 
to, and if it goes really badly, you 
might end up taking a trip to the 
salon anyways. 
So, you should be all set. Y ou 
have your color, your method, and 
your wits about you. Y ou know 
why you are dyeing your hair and 
are prepared for the outcome, no 
matter what it is. And remember, 
dyeing and changing your hair 
color is a lot of fun and a great way 
to express yourself, but, at the end 
of the day, it’s just hair.

Neon Retro Arcade, 2018, 
that’s where it all started. Located 
in Pasadena, my friend Jacob and 
I had wandered in with the inten -
tion to play classic games of the 
past. While the arcade games were 
fun, they only held our interest for 
a brief period of time. But buried 
away in the back of the arcade sat 
a Wii U and a plethora of con -
trollers, with the character select 
screen for “Super Smash Bros” 
displayed. /T_he new “Smash Bros” 
game had just been announced 
for the Nintendo Switch, so we 
thought we’ d give it a try. A/f_ter just 
the /f_irst game, we were hooked. It 
was simpler to pick up and play 
than other /f_ighting games, yet it 
still facilitated the /f_ierce /f_ires of 
combat. A/f_ter 2 hours of intense 
battles, we realized something: we 
needed more.
While I didn’t own a Wii U, 
I remembered that somewhere 
in my house, my original Wii 
was hiding along with an older 
version of “Super Smash Bros, 
Brawl. ” /T_hat was how I trained 
for nine months. Sure, it was an 
older iteration of the game, but it 
was the only means I had of play -
ing. Naturally, I was drawn to the 
fat, jolly penguin known as King 
Dedede and aimed to improve my 
skill with him. /T_hankfully, I wasn’t 
completely out of the loop with 
“Smash Bros” for Wii U either, as 
I’ d frequently go over to my friend 
Jose’s house and play it there. 
One of the biggest reasons I played the game at Jose’s house 
was for the competition. Each 
time I went over there and played 
against others, I could sense that 
I had gotten better. Smash Bros 
was diﬀerent from other games 
I played. Whereas those games 
told me I had improved through 
arti/f_icial statistics and leveling 
up, Smash made me feel like my 
character wasn’t the one getting better, I was the one getting bet -
ter. It was always such a treat to 
hang out with friends, screaming 
and laughing over our crazy plays 
in the game. Since Jose owned the 
game, he was the best out of the 
friend group; each time we hung 
out at his house, I tried to take him 
down but to no avail. I just had to 
wait for the new game to come 
out for us to be on an even play -ing /f_ield.
With the newest game in the 
series just around the corner, there 
was a lot of excitement in the air. 
It made me really feel like a part 
of the community. Some of my fa -
vorite memories with the series in -
volved attending early play demos 
of the game. Even when the line 
to play was 5 hours, the wait was 
far less gruesome when I social -ized with other people who were 
just as passionate, talking about 
how long we’ve played it, who our 
mains were, etc. I even met some 
of my closest friends while waiting 
in one of these lines. And then, ac -
tually playing the game, wow. As 
someone who primarily played 
Brawl, the game felt insanely fast -
er and more surreal to play — like 
something out of a dream. 
/T_hat dream eventually became 
a reality on Dec. 6, 2018. It was /f_i -
nals week at my high school, but 
that did nothing to stop me from 
bringing my Switch to school and 
playing nonstop with my friends. 
Seeing everyone get as excited as 
I was upon seeing the game was 
a feeling I’ll never forget. Jacob 
and I had a /f_inal to prepare for, so 
we went home together that day. 
But all I remember from that day 
was playing Smash Bros nonstop, 
unlocking characters together, 
and battling just as we had many 
months ago in the arcade. 
My love for Smash Bros comes 
from how community-building it 
is. /T_he amount of people I’ve met 
through the game is something I 
think no other video game could 
match; each time I play it, my 
skills feel truly tested. /T_hroughout 
this article, I’ve described playing 
“Smash” as hot-blooded battles, 
and that’s because they are. Ad -
mittedly, it sounds childish (and it 
is), but the thrill I feel when play -
ing the game — my heart pound -
ing, not knowing if I can win and 
palms sweating from how intense 
the game feels — is the feeling I 
live for.

AS YOU LIKE IT AT LA JOLLA 
PLAYHOUSE
Featuring a cast of trans, non-binary 
and Queer performers, Christopher 
Ashley and Will Davis’s re-imagined As 
You Like It is a celebration of limitless 
love and humanity. In Shakespeare’s 
classic romantic comedy, Rosalind and 
Orlando meet by chance in court and 
have an immediate connection. When 
they are both banished, fate brings 
them together again in the Forest of 
Arden. Far from the restrictions of 
court life, we find ourselves in a 
vibrant new world, where identities 
can be fully explored and romance can 
blossom in multiple forms. This bold 
and beautiful production inhabits a 
wonderful, ‘gender-ful’ world - a 
sensuous place that embraces the full 
spectrum of gender possibilities. 
Evoking the heady experience of falling 
in love, and underscored by 
heart-thumping live music, there are 
no boundaries in As You Like It, just 
endless complexities, infinite love and 
the joyful expression of true selves.

Men’s Basketball Struggles Shooting the Long Ball in 
Season-Opening Loss

On Monday, Nov. 7, UC San 
Diego men’s basketball (0–1, 0–0 
Big West) hosted Seattle Univer -
sity (2–0, 0–0 Western Athletic 
Conference) for the home opener 
of the 2022-23 season. A/f_ter /f_in -
ishing below .500 last year, the 
Tritons entered Monday night’s 
game looking to start their sea -
son on the right foot by winning 
on their home turf, while the 
Redhawks looked to sustain their 
strong play from the prior season.
/T_he Tritons, unfortunately, 
found themselves down double 
/f_igures early, as the Redhawks 
opened the game /f_iring on all cyl -
inders on the oﬀensive end, largely 
due to the play of their star guard, 
who went 4–5 from the 3-point 
range within the /f_irst four min -
utes of the contest. Having to claw 
their way back, UCSD spent most 
of the /f_irst half trying to shrink 
their de/f_icit and position them -
selves for a chance to enter half -
time with the game still in reach. 
A/f_ter falling behind by 13 points, 
UCSD’s oﬀense found some life 
with scoring contributions from 
redshirt junior center Emmanuel 
Tshimanga, redshirt junior guard 
Bryce Pope, and freshman guard 
Roddie Anderson III. However, 
despite battling back and cutting 
SU’s lead to 4 with under three minutes le/f_t in the /f_irst half, the 
Redhawks quickly retaliated by 
going on a 9–0 run and brought 
their lead back up to 13, ending 
the half at a score of 42–29. 
Within the /f_irst two minutes 
of the second half, the Redhawks 
extended their lead to 16 (their 
largest of the game) by a /f_ield goal 
by their starting forward. UCSD put a stop to their oﬀensive dry 
spell with more scoring contri -
butions from Tshimanga, as he 
made the /f_irst three /f_ield goals of 
the half for his team and cut the 
de/f_icit to 11 with 17:08 remaining 
in regulation. /T_he Tritons had a lot 
of fresh new faces, including se -
nior forward J’Raan Brooks, who 
made his Triton debut a/f_ter sit -ting out last season due to injury. 
Although the Tritons were able 
to shrink their de/f_icit to single 
digits at a point, the story of the 
second half was the hot shooting 
from 3-point range on the part 
of the Redhawks. UCSD did re -
ceive a solid performance from 
their guard Bryce Pope, who had 
15 points in the second half, and although the Tritons were only 
outscored by 1 point in the second 
half, they lost the game by a score 
of 85–71. 
/T_he most telling statistic of 
the game was the diﬀerence in 
the quality of 3-point shooting, 
with the Tritons making only a 
quarter of their 3-point shot at -
tempts at 5–20, and the Redhawks 
shooting above 40% from deep 
at 14–34. Another area that the 
Tritons hope to clean up mov -
ing forward is their eﬀort on the 
boards, as they were outscored 
19–7 on 2nd chance points. Cam -
eron Tyson for the Redhawks was 
the player of the game, as he shot 
12–18 from the /f_ield, including 
7–12 from beyond the arc, and led 
all scores with 35 points while also 
leading both teams in rebounding 
with 8. Pope led UCSD in scoring 
with 23 points, shooting 50% from 
the /f_ield and going a perfect 4–4 
from the line. Despite being out -
shot by a signi/f_icant margin from 
three, several positives that UCSD 
was able to take away from the 
game include having four players 
scoring in double /f_igures and out -
shooting SU at the free throw line 
by making over 75% of their free 
throw attempts. 
On Tuesday, Nov. 15, the 
Tritons will host the California 
Golden Bears at 7 p.m. and the 
/f_irst 1,500 students in attendance 
will have a chance to receive a free 
replica jersey.

Senior Night Victory

In their last regular season 
game of 2022, the 12th-ranked 
UC San Diego Men’s Water Polo 
team (12–12, 6–2 WWPA) en -
thralled a raucous Canyonview 
Aquatic Center crowd, beating 
the University of California, Ir -
vine (14–11, 2–2 GCC) by a score 
of 14–8. UCSD never trailed in 
this /T_hursday night matchup, as 
senior goalkeeper Alexander Ne -
meth and sophomore goalkeeper 
Logan Estes made a combined 11 
saves. Led by star senior attacker 
Vedran Latkovic, who notched 
a career-high of eight goals, the 
team’s graduating seniors drove 
the Tritons toward a commanding 
victory. 
/T_he Tritons set the tone early, 
racing out to a 3–0 lead. It started 
with a strong right-handed save, 
when Nemeth found senior Will 
Riley racing out on the perimeter, 
resulting in Riley skipping his 
shot past the outstretched UC Ir -
vine goalkeeper and into the net. 
A couple of possessions later, se -
nior Manuel Augusto made it 2-0 
for the Tritons, capping oﬀ an ex -
cellent string of passes with a goal 
from the point. Latkovic grabbed 
his /f_irst with 2:52 remaining in the 
quarter. Fighting oﬀ his defender 
and moving backward, Latkovic 
released a stunningly powerful 
shot from ten meters, hitting the 
underside of the crossbar and fall -
ing into the net. /T_his incredible 
goal was the /f_irst of /f_ive consecu -
tive from the Montenegrin star.
A/f_ter UC Irvine responded 
with two quick goals, the Tritons 
countered, pushing the score to 
4-2 with 1:25 le/f_t in the /f_irst quar -
ter. A/f_ter the Anteaters were pe -nalized on an exclusion call, Lat -
kovic converted the 6 on 5 from 
the perimeter a/f_ter a skillful set-
up pass by Augusto. Great goal -
keeping play held the game level 
for the rest of the quarter, giving 
UCSD the two-goal advantage at 
the break.
/T_he second quarter opened 
similarly to the /f_irst. A/f_ter a few 
wasted possessions by both sides, 
the Tritons earned a penalty with 
5:39 remaining in the half. Lat -
kovic powerfully led the Tritons to 
a 5–2 lead, with a rising skip shot 
into the right corner for the Mon -
tenegrin’s third goal of the game. 
However, only minutes later, the 
Anteaters were able to convert on 
another 6-on-5 opportunity and 
pushed the score to 5-3. 
/T_he Tritons’ sixth and Latkov -
ic’s fourth score came with only 
2:17 le/f_t in the half. /T_he senior 
pump faked twice from the point 
and released a forceful shot into 
the bottom le/f_t corner of the net. 
Latkovic made it 7–3 with a goal-
of-the-season contender, this time 
a/f_ter a quick release pass from 
the goalkeeper Nemeth. Finding 
himself facing only the UC Ir -
vine goalkeeper, Latkovic /f_licked 
a looping shot high over the arms 
of the goalie, which dropped so/f_tly 
into the net. /T_he Anteaters added 
two goals from the right side to 
end the half, but UCSD’s 7–5 lead 
was soon to be increased.
/T_he Tritons struck /f_irst in the 
third quarter with their third Ne -
meth-assisted breakaway goal, this 
time from senior Brendan Nugent. 
His goal opened what would be a 
/f_ive-goal quarter for the Tritons. 
Following the Anteaters’ /f_irst goal 
of the quarter, the Tritons restored 
their three-goal lead through red -
shirt freshman Brandon Fezzey. 
With only one second remaining on the shot clock, Fezzey ri/f_led a 
clutch skip shot past the Anteater 
goalkeeper to increase UCSD’s ad -
vantage to 9–6. 
A/f_ter another UC Irvine goal 
cut down the Tritons’ lead to two, 
UCSD scored three unanswered 
goals to close out the third quar -
ter. /T_he /f_irst, with 3:04 le/f_t in the 
period, came from Latkovic, who 
scored with a strong right-handed 
/f_inish from the point. He added 
his seventh just one minute later 
with an almost identical /f_inish, 
skipping a shot inside the right 
post. Finally, the Tritons’ twel/f_th 
goal was yet another breakaway 
assisted by Nemeth and scored by 
Manuel Augusto. It was Nemeth’s 
fourth assist of the match and the 
second goal for Augusto. UCSD held onto their 12–7 
lead in a quiet fourth quarter. 
Only 20 seconds into the period, 
Latkovic scored his career-high 
eighth goal of the match with per -
haps his best: a double-clutched, 
no-look strike into the top le/f_t  
corner. Out of all his incredible 
goals of the night, it was /f_itting he 
would save his best for last and re -
markably in his /f_inal regular sea -
son game for UCSD as well. 
With 3:30 le/f_t in the fourth 
quarter, sophomore Miles Wil -
son ri/f_led a le/f_t-handed shot into 
the goal, establishing the Tritons’ 
lead at 14–7. /T_he remainder of the 
game was the Logan Estes show, 
as the substitute goalkeeper made 
three saves in the /f_inal three min -
utes, including a one-on-one ris -ing stop with time running out on 
the clock. He was unable to pre -
vent an Anteater consolation goal, 
but his eﬀorts kept the /f_inal score 
at 14–8. 
Stellar defensive play and clini -
cal oﬀense culminated in an im -
pressive all-around game for the 
Tritons. It also served as revenge 
for an earlier 10–5 loss to UC Ir -
vine in September during the Tri -
ton Invitational. 
UCSD begins postseason play 
on Friday, Nov. 18 in the WWPA 
Tournament. /T_he No. 3-seeded 
Tritons will hope to upset favor -
ites, UC Davis, starting with their 
/f_irst-round matchup against No. 
6 seed, California Baptist Univer -
sity.
