“A national ID is powerful. 
This does not mean that 
a national ID is inherently 
bad. The argument of many 
that follows along the line of 
“being tracked is inherently 
bad” or “national IDs are like 
a dog tag which is inherently 
bad” are logical fallacies.”

On Monday, Sept. 26 the undergraduate organi -
zation Persian American Student Association 
(PASA) and the graduate community Iranian 
Student Association (ISTA) respectively held a vigil and a 
solidarity gathering in mourning of Masha Amini. 
Amini was a 22-year-old woman who was an -
nounced dead a/f_ter morality police — a unit dedicated to 
enforcing strict dress codes — took her to a “re-education 
center” because she appeared to not be wearing her hijab 
properly in accordance with local hijab laws.
/T_he Monday night vigil, organized by PASA, took 
place in front of Geisel Library. Approximately 100 stu -
dents were present at the event, where they spread infor -
mational /f_lyers and held candles with solemn music. /T_he 
number of students, who either heard from the Persian 
community or stopped by at the event, was “way more 
than we expected,” an anonymous PASA member and 
Roger Revelle College senior Matt said.* 
According to Matt, previously only 60 to 70 people 
show up at a typical event, and “it’s fantastic to see so 
many people stop by and ask what happened.” Matt de -
scribed the vigil as a “peaceful protest.” 
“/T_here is no point [for] us to become violent over 
here. If we become violent, we just show negative views 
about Persians over here. /T_he whole point is to spread the 
news as much as possible. We just want to have govern -
ment and local representatives to stand with Iran — to 
have much support as possible,” Matt explained.
He also told /T_he UCSD Guardian that the students 
that helped organize the vigil mostly have been to or lived 
in Iran. 
“/T_he fact we live in some areas where freedom is all 
around us, and we know in another world we used to not 
have those, motivates us to let people know that people 
in another world of the same age may not have such free -
dom as they do,” he said.
T wo days later, ISTA held a gathering at Graﬃti Art 
Park by the Old Student Center. Around 30 students 
gathered around the pedestrian path, chanting slogans 
such as “Women, Life, Freedom” and “Stop the Violence, 
Stop the Hate.”
/T_he event organizer, who wishes to remain anony -
mous, is a Jacobs School of Engineering Ph.D. candi -
date.* She told /T_he Guardian that, aside from showing 
solidarity by having this gathering, ISTA and PASA are 
also actively collecting student signatures to send a state -
ment to Chancellor Pradeep Khosla.
“ Another fact enraging people is that those people 
[who work for the Iranian regime] force women to wear 
hijab, while their own daughters live outside Iran, in [the] 
U.K. or in Canada, where they don’t have to wear hijab.” 
Matt continued, “/T_his is the double standard people see 
every day.”
Matt added that, diﬀerent from the previous genera -
tion, the current Iranian generation is living in ‘the infor -
mation era,’ where the Iranian government is less likely 
to hide or cover important social issues. Access to the 
internet motivated the new generation to /f_ight for their 
basic human rights more enthusiastically and vigorously.At the A.S. Council’s Week 1 
meeting on Sept. 28, senators met 
to discuss their capstone projects. 
To start, Senators Sky Yang, Fran -
cesca Juarez, Hope Morihara, 
Nikki Saito and Suleyma Villa 
presented their capstone project: 
Expanding Food Choices and 
Food Access on Campus. /T_he sen -
ators explained that their project 
was motivated by the lack of food 
options on campus, the inacces -
sible and expensive food options 
oﬀ-campus, and the lack of in -
clusivity for students who require 
speci/f_ic dietary adjustments. In 
order to increase accessible and 
aﬀordable food options that con -
sider dietary needs and personal 
and cultural preferences, they 
plan to work with UC San Diego’s 
Housing Dining Hospitality to in -
clude more accessible menu items 
and hire an on-campus nutrition -
ist to help students explore feasi -
ble food options. /T_hey also intend 
to raise awareness about the Re -
duced Allergen Dining Program 
and revamp the Triton2Go mo -
bile app to color-code dishes suit -
able for individuals with speci/f_ic 
dietary requirements and intro -
duce /f_ilters for common allergens. 
Next, senators presented their 
capstone project: International 
Week. /T_hey believed that al -
though UCSD has a diverse stu -
dent population and an Interna -
tional House, International House 
(I-House) feels isolated from the 
rest of campus. /T_herefore, they 
proposed International Week to 
bridge this divide. Inspired by the 
Asian Night Market held by the 
Multi-Asian Student Association, 
they intend to collaborate with 
I-House, Eleanor Roosevelt Col -
lege, various campus partners, 
and local businesses to host a 
night market each day of Interna -
tional Week that celebrates one of 
/f_ive continental regions. /T_hrough 
this, they hope to appreciate and 
introduce students to UCSD’s di -
verse student population. 
Senators Raha Azari, Michelle 
Griﬃth, Sydney Joe, Rhianen 
Callahan and Sukham Sidhu fol -
lowed by introducing their project 
on Disability Justice. /T_heir project 
aims to streamline and outline 
the process for students to apply 
for academic accommodations, 
as well as beginning conversa -
tions about having a disability at 
UCSD. /T_hey intend to do this by 
interviewing students and profes -
sors who have utilized Oﬃce for 
Students Disabilities (OSD) ser -
vices before, as well as by working 
with /T_he UCSD Guardian, Tri -
ton TV, KSDT Radio, and other

Tina, a Roger Revelle College /f_i/f_th-year, told /T_he 
Guardian that people in Iran usually need a VPN to ac -
cess un/f_iltered content in social media such as WhatsApp 
and Instagram.* However, recently the Iranian govern -
ment blocked the internet service nationwide due to the 
large-scale  protests. Such conditions made it so diﬃcult 
to communicate that her father had to wake up early in 
the morning to communicate with her via WhatsApp. 
Similar situations happened to her friend in Canada, who 
opted to have direct landline calls with her family in Iran, 
which is “really expensive” according to Tina.
“/T_hey realized how powerful social media gets,” Tina 
explained.  “/T_he more people talk, the more enraged 
people get, and the more they are threatened. So they just 
blocked the internet access and social media access.
/T_hird-year engineering graduate student Mahsa de -
cided not to contact her family members at all.* 
“/T_he internet connection is so limited. /T_here is a fear 
of being overheard and surveillanced. /T_he chance is low 
for [a] single individual. But you also don’t want risk. So 
a lot of time I just asked them how they’re doing and if 
they’re safe, but there is no real discussion about it,” she 
said.
Mahsa later introduced a video made by Iranian peo -
ple, as she iterated, “I don’t know how normal life feels 
like — have you ever been to the street and [kissed] your 
beloved one? Have you ever been to the beach and felt the 
breeze on your skin and your hair? Have you gone to [a] 
concert and danced to the music you love? We cannot do 
that! /T_his is the basic human right, and there is no need 
for explanation.”
“/T_his is much bigger than just Masha Amini. Every -
one [gets] up on the street and [expresses] all those sad -
ness and rage they felt for decades,” Mahsa said.” /T_he 
death of Mahsha Amini is more like ‘a symbol of the in -
nocent’ and a symbol of how women ‘lack control of their 
own body.’
Tina also shared a poem she had discussed with her 
father prior to the interview about a peacock cutting oﬀ 
its feathers. Someone saw the peacock in the midst of the 
action and asked, “Why would you do that? Your feathers 
are so beautiful.” /T_he peacock responded, “My feathers 
threatened my life. Because of this physical beauty, I’ve 
been imprisoned in the zoo. I want people to see me for 
who I am, not for my physical appearances. I’m not only 
my feathers. I’m more than that.”
“I think that symbolizes Iranian culture of cutting 
hair [as a protest].” Tina, a/f_ter retelling the poem, con -
tinued, “If my hair is such a concern to you — if it’s so 
attractive that I have to cover all the time, then I don’t 
want it. I don’t want you to control how I present myself.”
Similar protests have occurred in other communities, 
including Irvine, Orange County, San Francisco, and 
Crown Point Park in San Diego this past Saturday.

A.S. Graphic Studio  /T_his fall, UC San Diego will 
continue its rapid vertical expan -
sion by beginning construction 
on the Pepper Canyon West Liv -
ing and Learning Neighborhood. 
/T_he complex will include two of 
the tallest residential towers in 
campus history, set to debut in 
Fall 2024. 
In addition to Pepper Canyon 
West, the new /T_heater District 
Living and Learning Neighbor -
hood will also include two tow -
ers standing over 20 stories tall, 
and the North Ridgewalk Living 
and Learning Neighborhood is 
expected to include a number of 
high rises, adding a pivotal step 
toward developing a distinct 
campus skyline. 
Head of Special Collections 
and Archives at Geisel Library 
Lynda Claassen has been on cam -
pus since 1983 and remembers 
what it was like before the intense 
vertical construction began. She 
recalls a time when Geisel could 
be seen from the highway, and has 
experienced the leadership of four 
chancellors throughout her time 
on campus. 
“I think there has always been 
some construction going on” 
Claassen said. 
I would say recently with this 
Chancellor, who is also commit -
ted to providing beds for every 
student, that the level of building 
and construction is more rapid 
and more extensive than it has 
been in the past.”

/gid00020/gid00006/gid00015/gid00010/gid00016/gid00019/gid00001/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019just under 13,000 when Claas -
sen started working on campus 
nearly 40 years ago. /T_hat number 
has spilled over 40,000 as of last 
fall, making the push for vertical 
expansion one of the only ways to 
maintain an open campus /f_illed 
with greenery. 
UCSD isn’t the only UC cam -
pus to experience vertical growth 
patterns. Earlier this year, UCLA 
completed construction of a 
17-story residential complex, and 
UC Berkeley has met pushback 
from locals over their plans to 
replace historic People’s Park 
withhigh-rise student accommo -
dations. 
In their original long range 
development plans from  the 
1960s, the three campuses did not  
account for the sort of rapid ex -
pansion seen today. 
UCSD’S original 1963 long 
range development plan envi -
sioned a maximum enrollment 
of 27,500 students. Chancellor 
Khosla told the San Diego Union-
Tribune in 2021 that enrollment 
could reach up to 50,000 in the 
next ten years, and his 2014 stra -
tegic plan and 2018 long range de -
velopment plan seem to provide 
the infrastructure. 
With the chancellor’s eyes set 
ahead, Eleanor Roosevelt Col -
lege senior Jonathan Fong has 
con/f_licted feelings about the cur -
rent construction projects. With a 
housing crisis that has le/f_t many 
students stranded trying to /f_ind 
oﬀ campus housing in the La Jolla 
area, and a lack of parking space 
for commuter students, he feels 
as though the administration is 
failing to consider the impact that construction has on current stu -
dents.
“I know that things like the 
housing crisis won’t change un -
less UCSD does something, so a 
part of me feels like I should be 
at least a bit grateful that UCSD 
is building something for future 
students to bene/f_it from.” Fong 
said. “However, it feels like so few 
of the projects are actually meant 
to bene/f_it me — for example, I’m 
not sure how to get excited over 
new Sixth when, as an upperclass -
man, I practically have no shot of 
ever living there. Same goes for 
Eighth college, which will only 
be done when I’ll have gradu -
ated anyway. Essentially it’s all 
just noise and shiny buildings I’ll 
never step a foot into.”
Despite his reservations, Fong 
admits that he has partially ben -
e/f_ited from some of the construc -
tion, particularly the new bike 
lanes across campus. But even 
then, he doesn’t believe that they 
adequately resolve traﬃc conges -
tion. 
“It feels like current students 
are being deprived of infrastruc -
ture in the name of future solu -
tions they’ll never get to see or 
bene/f_it from, with little eﬀort 
made by UCSD to provide ap -
propriate solutions to mitigate the 
impact,” Fong said. “Moreover, a 
lot of the new infrastructure has 
felt overly piecemeal — the vari -
ous new bike lanes, for example, 
don’t extend across the entirety of 
Ridgewalk, and there are still sig -
ni/f_icant chokepoints where bike 
traﬃc gets caught up in pedestri -
an traﬃc, causing both frustrat -
ing delays and safety concerns to both on the path.”
ERC senior Saranya Rajago -
palan has expressed similar frus -
trations over the way in which 
campus construction has made 
getting around campus more dif -
/f_icult, but isn’t as bothered about 
it as Fong. 
“I think the administration 
is thinking about the future and 
worrying about accommodating 
for students who will join later, 
but the construction emails help 
inform the current students as 
much as possible,” Rajagopalan 
said.
Rajagopalan has been enjoy -
ing the bene/f_its of construction 
projects that have been completed 
during her time on campus, par -
ticularly the amenities in the new 
Sixth College. 
“/T_he campus has changed a 
lot since my freshman year,” Ra -
jagopalan said. “/T_he construction 
that was happening around Sixth 
College was there for my /f_irst two 
quarters on campus, and then re -
turning to campus a/f_ter COVID, 
Sixth College was mostly built 
and all the new restaurants came 
around there as well. /T_his change 
has de/f_initely been bene/f_icial to 
students, as it’s a great new living 
space for incoming students and 
the new food areas accommodate 
more for the incoming class sizes, 
as they keep growing.” 
Sixth College sophomore 
Mary Vu seems to agree. 
“It’s exciting to see the cam -
pus grow and change so much,” 
Vu said. “I think Sixth college is 
really beautiful from their lecture 
halls to apartments/resident halls 
to the dining hall. Also seeing organizations to raise awareness 
about disability justice and source 
opinions on how OSD can be im -
proved. 
/T_he last capstone project pre -
sented was You, Me and Men -
strual Equity by Lian Barkhordar, 
Karla Tirado, Kathleen Nguyen, 
Mariealy Espinoza Cortes, Max 
Gruber, Miriam Lope and Ve -
rina Leung. /T_heir project focuses 
on period poverty, the inability 
to access period products, which 
negatively aﬀects menstruators’ 
mental and physical health and 
education. Last fall, Governor Newsom signed AB 376, which 
mandates all public grade schools, 
community colleges and Califor -
nia State Universities to provide 
free menstrual products for their 
students. However, the bill only 
strongly recommends for Univer -
sity of California campuses to do 
so. /T_herefore, the senators plan to 
implement UC Menstrual Equity 
San Diego (UCME-SD), a collab -
orative space for menstrual equity 
discussion and eﬀorts amongst 
various stakeholders on campus. 
/T_hrough UCME-SD, they hope to 
implement free menstrual prod -
ucts at various bathrooms around campus.
A.S. Council meetings take 
place at 6 p.m. every Wednesday 
and are open to students. Students can participate in these meetings 
by joining their Zoom link or 
tuning in on Facebook Live.
Eighth [college] being built has 
been exciting too.”
Regardless of the ups and 
downs of campus expansion, it 
appears that the rate of construc -
tion will only ramp up in the com -
ing years, given the chancellor’s 
long-term growth plans. With a 
total of 16 ongoing campus con -
struction projects at the moment, 
it’s safe to say that new students in

Sparky mitra
The US should adopt the national ID
/T_he U.S. already has a de facto 
national identi/f_ication system 
(national ID) — the social secu -
rity number (SSN). /T_he driver’s 
license is also commonly used as 
an ID for background checking 
to rent a home, board a plane, or 
buy alcohol. /T_herefore, the U.S. 
should stop denying the national 
ID based on grounds of main -
taining the privacy oﬀered by not 
having IDs, because we’ve never 
had that sort of privacy — we’ve 
always had IDs, and we need IDs 
for our society to function.
/T_here are already so many IDs 
in your life that it is impossible 
not to have IDs. Besides the SSN 
and driver’s license, there’s also 
your student ID that you need to 
get into your dorms, register for 
events, and take exams. /T_here’s 
also your email, “anonymous” 
Discord accounts, credit cards, 
and customer IDs online retail 
companies assign to you that you 
might not even know you have, 
like perhaps your waste manage -
ment company. Your /f_ingerprints 
and DNA can become IDs, or per -
haps already have, who knows? 
My point is that we’re not going 
to be any more secure not having 
a national ID or any less secure 
having one since our information 
is already everywhere, so with all 
the bene/f_its of a national ID, we 
might as well have one.
A national ID is a serious 
matter. One reason why the U.S. should have an oﬃcial national 
ID is so that this ID will be treat -
ed /f_ittingly as an ID, and so that 
ID holders will be reminded of 
its true function, instead of the 
misleading “social security num -
ber” and “driver’s license” of the 
two current de facto national IDs. 
An oﬃcial national ID would also 
remove the ambiguity of two de 
facto IDs.
But other factors necessitate 
an oﬃcial national ID that is 
more than just a rebranded SSN. 
/T_he advantage of a national 
ID is that it can simplify govern -
ment procedures, which can not 
only oﬀset the cost of creating 
and maintaining a new system, 
but save tax dollars in the long 
run. /T_hink of the DMV and the 
hassle it takes to get a driver’s li -
cense. Or think of the many dif -
ferent IDs the U.S. government 
currently deals with: green card, 
work permit, visa, etc. A single 
person may hold multiple IDs at 
once or move from ID to ID, such 
as changing their driver’s license 
when they move to another state 
or not having to use their green 
card anymore a/f_ter naturaliza -
tion. /T_his causes redundancy and 
mental exhaustion, costing time 
and money.
Instead, a national ID can be 
universally issued to every single 
person who has been in the coun -
try, whether natural born, immi -
grant, or just visiting. /T_he ID can 
then have modular features based 
on that person’s status such as 
visiting non-citizen, resident, or 
citizen. /T_his way, when a person becomes naturalized, they only 
need to get this particular /f_ield 
updated instead of doing the pa -
perwork for an entirely new ID. 
Similarly, when someone moves 
to another state, they won’t have 
to switch to that state’s license. 
/T_he national ID can also function 
as a passport, making it accessi -
ble to all rightly eligible citizens, 
in contrast to the current system 
with fees and lengthy applications 
that strip socioeconomically dis -
advantaged citizens of their basic 
liberty to travel and seek better 
opportunities and happiness.
Another advantage of a na -
tional ID system is to make sure 
voting is accurate and fair. I think 
it can also increase voter turnout. 
If everyone has a national ID, 
then there would be no shame in 
asking for it, and there on the ID 
would clearly state the person’s 
eligibility to vote and also have 
a digital punch-card feature that 
can be veri/f_ied with records on 
the government’s database. 
A National ID system can help 
the homeless and those in pover -
ty. Why do people become home -
less? Or even better, why did this 
particular person become home -
less? Knowing speci/f_ic info about 
someone can allow for person -
alized assistance. However, the 
current problem is tracking these 
people. Homeless people without 
IDs are hard to track and thus 
hard to help, and the complicated 
system in the U.S. prevents them 
from obtaining IDs. According 
to the Homeless Advocacy Proj -
ect: “For many people, a /f_irst step in overcoming homelessness is 
obtaining identi/f_ication. ” /T_he 
simplicity of the national ID can 
ensure that everyone has an ID, 
paving the way for equitable ac -
cess to help.
A national ID is powerful. 
/T_his does not mean that a na -
tional ID is inherently bad. /T_he 
argument of many that follows 
along the line of “being tracked is 
inherently bad” or “national IDs 
are like a dog tag which is inher -
ently bad” are logical fallacies.

In the end, having national

As Hurricane Ian batters Flor -
ida and other states on the East 
Coast, it is important to look at 
how it could’ve been prevented 
with non-partisan protective 
measures. /T_he governor of Flor -
ida, Governor Ron DeSantis, is 
now seeking federal health as is 
necessary — the same politician 
who was once critical of sending 
support to other states during 
Hurricane Sandy. /T_he increase in 
one in 100 and one in 1000 year 
hurricanes is o/f_ten directly corre -
lated with the climate emergency. 
Y et, Governor DeSantis remains 
critical of many climate change 
prevention eﬀorts including the 
passage of any legislation resem -
bling the Green New Deal.
While it is the federal govern -
ment's job to step in and oﬀer aid 
when any of the union’s states 
are facing horri/f_ic events such as 
this one, there are multiple other 
ways in which scientists have 
tried to equip and advise states 
like Florida before these tragedies 
occur. For example, despite there 
being strong building codes in ef -
fect, rapid growth has led to un -
checked buildings along the dan -
gerous coast. /T_his growth is o/f_ten 
encouraged by diﬀerent interest 
groups supporting partisan divide 
to increase pro/f_its related to land 
development. Rather than mov -
ing development inland, many try to redevelop areas which have 
been wiped out by disaster be -
fore. /T_his leads to a vicious cycle 
of rebuilding in the wake of de -
struction without providing a 
permanent solution for families 
away from danger zones that can 
be targeted by disastrous events 
such as Hurricane Ian. But be -
cause of partisan interests, uniting 
behind common goals of keeping 
families safe in the future becomes 
more and more diﬃcult for poli -
ticians. In turn, they are forced to 
push development uninformed by 
previous natural calamities and a 
changing climate.
Apart from repeating mistakes, 
other scenarios point to one-time 
partisan deviations from standard 
protocols leading to disastrous 
consequences. A recent example 
of this occurring was when the 
Texan electrical grid froze over 
during a time of unusually low 
temperatures and high snowfall in 
Texas. Because of the state’s pre -
vious deviation from the nation's 
two main electrical grid systems, 
one of the east and one of the 
west, they did not subject them -
selves to the same standards that 
were placed by these interstate 
grid systems, which had guidance 
from the federal level. Due to this 
oversight and blatant /f_launting of 
cooperative regulation enactment 
with other political leaders despite 
diﬀerences in opinion, Texas had 
not created a weatherized electric 
grid system. Rather than fore -Letting Go of Crisis-Driven

shadowing the potential crises 
that could occur in the case that 
the state relied on private interests’ 
analyses, the state government al -
lowed these corporate interests 
to set guidelines that made the 
people’s future safety a secondary 
priority. /T_his led to an electric grid 
system that was not ready for the 
burden of temperatures deviating 
from the norm, as the system was 
not weatherized.
Had partisanship been put 
aside, the government of Texas 
could have collaborated with the 
federal government and other 
states that were part of the two na -
tional grids that had strict regula -
tions guiding their quality in the 
event of a freeze or high tempera -
ture spell, like the months-long 
one that took place in Texas this 
last summer, resulting in daily 
highs in the 110s.
Rather than waiting for federal 
funding when devastation strikes, 
a new mentality needs to be ignit -
ed within the United States. /T_his 
mentality needs to be one cen -
tered around /f_ixing what’s weak 
before it’s broken. 
For those who want better 
mental health care for potential 
mass shooters, this can look like 
providing free mental health care 
coverage. Even if they don’t agree 
with those across the aisle on gun 
reform, they can act on the men -
tal health care that they seem to 
wholeheartedly support. With this 
being said, gun reforms have been passed following devastation in 
states like Florida, where a conser -
vative governor adopted laws that 
would raise the age limit to buy an 
A.R. 15. Why could this have not 
been done before the devastation 
struck as a bipartisan measure 
to protect students and citizens 
across the nation who rely on the 
safety of public spaces to carry out 
their daily activities?
For protection against hur -
ricanes, this could look like the 
Governor of Texas working with 
the Biden Administration to re -
build the seawall in Galveston 
while urging developments in -land and incentives for Galveston 
residents to move inland. It could 
look like shi/f_ting from oil drilling 
to seeking alternative energy is to 
ensure that the temperatures of 
the Gulf remain low enough to not 
allow the development of a future 
hurricane.
It’s time to abandon the philos -
ophy that crises necessitate united 
action, and adopt one that dictates 
that future crises require united 
prevention.By  SPARKY MITRA

HECTOR ARRIETA
The Death of  Ethel Cain 
Hayden Anhedönia, also known by her stage name Ethel Cain, uses Cain as a precau -
tionary tale about the eﬀects that familial and religious pressure can cause on a person’s 
outlook on love and acceptance, and the dark path that trauma can lead a person down, 
which, as “Preacher’s Daughter” demonstrates, o/f_ten has dire consequences. 
Under the pseudonym Ethel Cain, goth pop artist Hayden Anhedönia began making 
music to understand her rocky relationship with her family, faith, and queerness. In her 
/f_irst full-length album “Preacher’s Daughter,” Cain draws from her upbringing in the 
American South, and particularly as part of the Southern Baptist Church, to cra/f_t a dark 
tale following the life and death of Anhedönia’s alter ego, Ethel Cain. Sitting at an hour 
and /f_i/f_teen minutes, the album demands listeners’ emotional investment to fully realize 
Cain’s /f_ilmic vision for “Preacher’s Daughter.” Cain’s haunting instrumentals are accen -
tuated by hellish sounds like demonic chants, buzzing /f_lies, and low notes that reverber -
ate until they fade, all of which set the tone for the gut wrenching lyrics that follow. 
/T_he /f_irst two tracks, “Family Tree (Intro)” and “American Teenager,” reveal the grim 
overarching themes explored throughout the record: intergenerational trauma, love and 
violence, and religious guilt as an all-American teen. In “Family Tree (Intro),” Cain sings: 
“Jesus can always reject his father, but he cannot escape his mother’s blood,” indicating 
the suﬀocation of Cain’s religious and familial ties, particularly with her father. 
Despite its deceptive pop beat, “American Teenager” depicts Cain’s turn to alcoholism 
in order to combat an overwhelming feeling of isolation from her family and God: “Jesus, 
if you’re listening, let me handle my liquor. And Jesus, if you’re there, why do I feel alone 
in this room with you?” /T_he song illustrates loneliness despite being in large crowds, 
which is particularly prominent for Cain during school and church. Cain’s feelings reveal 
the restlessness and insecurity that many young adults experience, eﬀectively laying the 
groundwork for her downward spiral. 
Cain’s isolation grows when her /f_irst love leaves, marking the /f_irst integral event in 
her story. “A House in Nebraska” is the /f_irst of four tracks spanning over seven minutes, 
and one of my favorites. Beginning with single piano notes under Cain’s echoing voice, 
Cain foreshadows her own impending doom. /T_he slow pacing of the song emphasizes her 
pain and growing lethargy. Towards the end, a release of emotion is expressed through 
a cutting guitar melody over Cain’s muted wails. Extended non-lyrical vocalizations are 
frequent throughout the album and sound similar to church choir chants. /T_hese inter -
ludes give space to unleash inarticulable emotions, a frustrating phenomenon that many 
listeners can relate to. 
Track seven “/T_horoughfare” is the nine and a half minute epic that marks the begin -
ning of Act 2. Opening with guitar strums and harmonica notes reminiscent of South -
western bars, Cain tells the story of meeting a diﬀerent man set for the West Coast. Simi -
lar to Anhedönia’s actual life, Ethel Cain leaves home to escape the suﬀocation of life in 
the South. A/f_ter coming out, Anhedönia was ostracized by the Southern Baptist Church 
that had raised her. /T_hen, at 18, she le/f_t home and fell into hard drug use. Years later, 
during the formation of Ethel Cain’s character, Anhedönia began redirecting her life by 
using Cain’s as a cautionary tale. XUAN LY  /gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
In Cain’s story, she goes west with the man from “/T_horoughfare,” and over the course 
of the drive the two become close. Still, Cain’s heartbreak in Act 1 leaves her weary of 
love. As a result, Cain leans into her sexuality while her lover showcases new and sin -
ister behavior. Like with Cain’s past partners, her current lover’s growing dependence 
on drugs leads to physical violence in the relationship. /T_he dark and synthetic sound of 
“Gibson Girl” lends to the more sensual lyrics that provides hints of Cain’s acceptance 
of love and violence as a duo, which is derived from the relationship with her sexually 
abusive father: “and if it feels so good, then it can’t be bad.”
In terms of Anhedönia’s experiences, there may also be parallels between the expres -
sion of Cain’s sexuality in “Gibson Girl” and the exploration of Anhedönia’s femininity 
as a transgender woman. Transness is never sensationalized in Cain’s work, but remains 
a central undercurrent in her music. A/f_ter leaving home, Anhedönia was able to freely 
delve into her relationship with womanhood. Anhedönia’s search for freedom is mir -
rored in Cain’s sexual liberation. 
/T_he next /f_ive tracks follow the betrayal, murder, and a/f_terlife of the young Ethel Cain, 
a series of events that is reminiscent of the betrayal and death of Jesus Christ. Two of 
the last /f_ive tracks are ambient music that represent Cain’s anger as she is killed by her 
lover, then her ascent into the a/f_terlife accompanied by angelic piano. Hints of the spe -
ci/f_ic events surrounding Cain’s death can be found in the plot of the banned /f_ilm that the 
tenth track borrows its title from: “August Underground.” /T_he 2001 horror /f_ilm brutally 
depicts a serial killer who documents the kidnappings, sexual abuse, and murders of his 
victims, which indicates that Cain might have suﬀered the same fate. With no accompa -
nying lyrics for “August Underground,” Cain’s allusion to the /f_ilm speaks magnitudes. 
However, fans of “Preacher’s Daughter” have also speculated that Cain’s death could 
have involved cannibalism. /T_he /f_inal track “Strangers,” another one of my favorites, hints 
at the cannibalism: “if I’m turning in your stomach and I’m making you feel sick.” /T_his 
line could also signify Cain’s murderous lover’s guilt as the notion of moral “goodness” is 
heavily explored in the song. But as Cain re/f_lects on the outcome of her life, she attempts 
to forgive the people that have wronged her, following a central Christian value. Cain 
ends the album with a message for her mother, emphasizing the undeniable connection 
between family despite the ri/f_ts created overtime. 
It’s clear in the closeness of Cain’s and Anhedönia’s stories that Cain makes music 
for herself. On a technical level, Cain self writes, produces, and releases music under 
her independent label Daughters of Cain. In an interview with Pitchfork, Cain expresses 
the blurriness between the end of Anhedönia’s sense of self and the beginning of Cain’s 
character. I love how Cain runs on her own time, carefully revealing her story between 
instrumental interludes and long choral notes. Although the length and pacing of many 
songs can be unconducive to casual listening or mainstream success, when diving into 
the conception of “Preacher’s Daughter,” I can’t help but be amazed by Cain’s artistic 
prowess. /T_he tragedy of running from one place of entrapment only to /f_ind another is

Conspicuous due to “The 
Communist Manifesto” nearly 
always displayed at their window, 
Groundwork Books, a non-profit 
student organization, sits in the 
middle of the Old Student Center 
on the UC San Diego campus. The 
old, brown buildings embracing 
it create a sense of antiquity, one 
that is mirrored by the history 
and politics held by the bookstore. 
The name “Groundwork” 
is representative of the store’s 
mission statement: setting the 
groundwork for a new, more 
equal society. Originally founded 
by Marxists and Anarchists, 
this history of radical thought 
has been passed down and has 
manifested through organizing 
and activism. According to 
an anonymous Groundwork 
employee, A, “[they] are of the 
belief that the society that we 
live in, which is hierarchical, is 
eventually going to collapse, and 
when it does collapse, we would 
like to be there as a theoretical and 
social resource, for all working 
people and students, and be a 
groundwork for organizing in this 
post-capitalist future.”*
Aligning with these values, 
Groundwork functions as a non-
hierarchical cooperative, and 
therefore, employees do not have 
assigned roles. Instead, their 
system is to go through their 
agenda (or goals) during their 
meetings, where members have 
the opportunity to volunteer for 
certain tasks. This is referred to 
as “residual responsibility,” since 
everyone’s primary responsibility 
is to volunteer at the store and be 
a part of the collective. 
Groundwork is one of four 
cooperatives on campus at present 
(there used to be approximately 
12 before), which includes the Food Co-Op, the General 
Store, the Ché Café and of 
course, Groundwork. All four 
cooperatives support and 
empower each other, according 
to A.
“Groundwork definitely 
feels organic,” A told The 
UCSD Guardian. “I come into 
the store, and there are lively 
conversations going on, all my 
friends are here and then I 
get to staff the store and meet 
new, interesting people and 
hopefully even recruit some 
into Groundwork.” 
As for the variety of books 
in the store, Groundwork 
features sections including 
Marxist Theory, Queer Theory, 
Feminism, literary fiction and 
more. According to A, books 
from their Marxist section sell 
the most, particularly their 
bestseller, “The Communist 
Manifesto.” Groundwork buys 
approximately 20 copies per 
quarter, and they consistently 
sell out almost all of them. 
Groundwork is always trying 
to stock more and update their 
existing collection. Recently, 
they have been trying to update 
their SW ANA (Southwest Asia 
and North African) section, 
as well as purchase books by 
UCSD alumni including Angela 
Davis. A says that Groundwork 
tries to gauge what is interesting 
and in demand by students, 
and stocks books based on that. 
Additionally, Groundwork 
has an extensive used books 
section.
“We’ve always had a policy 
of not letting knowledge go to 
waste,” A told The Guardian. 
“And when someone does come 
into the bookstore and gives 
us a donation of books, we 
put them in the used books 
section.”
A says that one of his 
favorite aspects of Groundwork is meeting people who come 
into the store and strike up 
conversations with members. 
Many of them share the same 
political ideologies — namely 
Marxism and Marxist-adjacent 
political ideologies — and 
are interested in activism and 
organizing throughout campus. 
A has met students who are 
interested in doing outreach 
with cops on campus, United 
Students Against Sweatshops (a 
pro-labor student organization 
at UCSD), students interested 
in Indigenous justice, and much 
more. A cites an example where 
in Spring Quarter 2022, after the 
Roe v. Wade overturning draft 
was leaked, several members 
organized at Groundwork. Thus, 
within a week, organizers were 
able to execute a successful 
protest outside Geisel Library. 
This protest, which was one 
of many, exemplifies their 
intent to hold individuals and 
organizations accountable for 
their actions.
Groundwork has been 
subject to right-wing attacks 
in the past. In 2017, there was 
an arson incident — which 
no one was ever caught or held accountable for — where 
someone burned down one of the 
book carts outside Groundwork. 
Groundwork believes that the 
arson was a right-wing attack 
motivated by opposition towards 
Groundwork’s leftist beliefs, and 
that their main intent was to 
burn down the actual bookstore, 
which they failed to accomplish.
As far as how the University 
views Groundwork and the other 
cooperatives on campus, A notes 
that in general, the campus has 
taken a negative attitude towards 
the cooperatives. They tried to 
shut down the cooperatives years 
ago, but ultimately failed and 
ended up signing a new master 
space agreement with all four 
co-ops.
According to A, they are 
viewed as “a thorn in the side 
of the UCSD administration” 
due to their heavy involvement 
in labor organizing and rallying 
strikes, such as a cost of living 
adjustment strike during 
the height of the COVID-19 
pandemic in 2020. 
A believes that the University 
has made a concerted effort 
to ensure that student life and 
social life are well-regulated; though there is a seven (soon to 
be eight) college system, there 
is no specific meeting area for 
students to organize or socialize, 
and there is a stigma that UCSD 
is “socially dead.”
“However, I think if you come 
to Groundwork, you will see that 
UCSD is not socially dead, and 
that one of the most important 
student-run places on campus is 
the Old Student Center, where we 
have all the other cooperatives,” 
A told The Guardian. “It is 
essential to keep these places up 
and running. Members are only 
here for four years and then they 
leave, but as a UCSD community, 
it is our responsibility to keep 
Groundwork alive, to keep these 
cooperatives alive and to ensure 
that we are here for posterity and 
retain Groundwork’s function as 
a safe space, an organizing space, 
and as a theoretical resource for 
students at UCSD.”

The first memory of a home-
cooked meal I can recall on 
my own was at age three: a big 
butter Tupperware filled with 
Grandpa’s famous chicken soup. 
My parents bought me my first 
cookbook at six. I started mak -
ing them anniversary dinners at 
the age of eleven. To say food is 
a part of my identity would be 
a vast understatement. For this 
reason, I knew that the road trip 
my father and I took this sum -
mer from North Carolina, back 
to California would have its fill 
of culinary excellence. My one 
rule: no restaurants that we can 
dine with at home. Pack a fork 
and wear comfortable clothes 
for this cross-country road trip, 
food edition.
/gid00015/gid00032/gid00050/gid00001/gid00016/gid00045/gid00039/gid00032/gid00028/gid00041/gid00046/gid00485/gid00001/gid00013/gid00042/gid00048/gid00036/gid00046/gid00036/gid00028/gid00041/gid00028
The first stop was planned 
before I even went home last 
summer. I knew that New Or -
leans was where we would be -
gin. As a history buff in my own 
right, I am fascinated by the rich 
culture of New Orleans. From 
its repurposed architecture to 
its confectionery delights, what 
originally was to be a few hours 
in the crescent city turned into a 
full day’s trip. I want to preface 
that New Orleans is where we 
spent most of our food money 
and is the most fleshed-out part 
of this article. We wanted to ex -
plore first, but once our feet hit 
the paved streets, our stomachs 
rumbled to the city’s beat. We 
ate lunch at Coterie Restaurant 
and Oyster Bar, a restaurant with 
rave reviews for their jambalaya 
and gumbo. The building looked 
like a renovated music hall, with 
glass doors working as windows 
and deep, refurbished chande -
liers. From the menu, my dad got 
the Tour of New Orleans, and I 
got the Tour of Acadia. 
The Tour of Acadia came 
with a sausage chicken jam -
balaya, crawfish etouffee, and 
chicken sausage gumbo with 
french bread to dip. The etouffee 
reminded me of lobster bisque, 
but with the bite of creole sea -
soning and southern love. The 
crawfish were buttery and per -
fectly cooked. I expected it to be 
a little tough because it was in the 
soup, but every bite popped per -
fectly in my mouth. The gumbo’s 
roux had a beautiful brown color 
— thick but not clumpy. Paired 
with the french bread, I got all 
the smokey flavor of the liquid 
and then a spoon full of tender, 
braised chicken and peppery 
creole andouille sausage. The 
rice in both the jambalaya and 
gumbo retained the flavor of its 
braising liquid without coming 
out too soft, keeping the flavor 
in every spoonful. 
Honestly, I have no com -
plaints, and while I couldn’t fin -
ish my plate, my dad gladly ate 
the few bites left. I was pretty full 
at this point, but he saw bread 
pudding on the menu and knew 
we should order it. I’m glad he 
mentioned it because I can say 
I will never taste a better bread 
pudding in my life. If you have 
ever had cinnamon french toast, 
imagine that taste in a spongey, 
stacked, and aerated portion. 
Covered in a caramel rum re -
duction that I could easily put in 
my coffee every day, the buttery 
caramel and spiced rum married 
in the best way. When I turn 21, 
it is the first thing I want to try 
my hand at. Now that we were thoroughly 
stuffed, we left the restaurant 
with my dad talking about the 
food for the next four hours 
(and after). Unfortunately, even 
though we were in the heart of 
New Orleans, nowhere had their 
famed frog legs that I had been 
wanting to try since the begin -
ning of summer. But, I digress. 
As the sun set, our stomachs 
were finally settled enough to try 
the dessert we’ve all been waiting 
for: those man-catching beig -
nets that our girl Tiana made in 
“Princess and the Frog” (2008). 
We asked a few locals which 
place they believed had the best 
beignets, and we settled on Cafe 
Beignet, right at the edge of the 
French Quarter. A lot of pages 
will tell you Cafe Du Monde is 
the best. Everyone we asked said 
that because the cafe is so popu -
lar, they tend to make their beig -
nets in advance, so unless you 
go in the morning, there is no 
guarantee that they will be fresh. 
While I may not know if Cafe 
Du Monde lives up to its title, 
we were satisfied all the same at 
Cafe Beignet. The beignets were 
just as airy as I imagined, fingers 
sticky with heated powdered 
sugar. The taste reminded me of 
funnel cake. You could tell they 
were freshly made because you 
could barely touch them until 
the heat escaped. The only com -
plaint we could fathom was the 
lack of drizzles. The only drizzle 
we could get was chocolate, but I 
think honey would have elevated 
the taste of the warm puff and 
the powdered sugar. But again, 
I wouldn’t say this distracted me 
from the New Orleans treat.
We weren’t able to eat until 
lunch the next day from how 
much food was in our stomachs.

Texas was the longest part of 
our drive — a whole day and a 
half! — but we only ate at one 
non-fast food restaurant. I was 
still fiending for some frog legs, 
and even though I had basi -
cally given up on my quest, my 
dad still made an effort to look 
for places with them. We found 
Dry Dock Oyster Bar online, 
and after reading the reviews, 
we decided to give it a shot. We 
both got a soup; I got the craw -
fish etouffee and my dad the 
seafood gumbo as a comparison 
since they claimed to have New 
Orleans-style food. While both 
soups were creamy and flavor -
ful, I believe we were ruined by 
having them first in NOLA, be -
cause we both agreed afterward By rosabella debty
/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
that we could have done with -
out them. My dad got a shrimp 
po boy — something he gave up 
in NOLA after our bigger-than-
stomach food tour. And even 
though I had nothing else to 
compare them to, I enjoyed the 
frog legs. 
They had a light, well-sea -
soned cornmeal breading that 
crisped the meat but didn’t over -
power the flavor. Unlike chicken 
legs, you have to take the skin off 
of frog legs, so it creates almost 
a faux skin to crunch into. A lot 
of people will say it tastes like 
chicken, and while I can see that 
they both have a similar base, I 
would say the frog meat had an 
earthy taste — kind of like tast -
ing the difference between cat -
fish and whitefish. The meat it -
self also had a smoother texture, 
lacking the cartilage of a chicken 
bone which made it a little more 
enjoyable to eat. I have to give a 
shoutout to my dad because if he 
hadn’t kept looking after we left 
NOLA, I would still be ignorant 
of the “tastes like chicken” de -
bate.

The only thing we were up -
set about almost missing out on 
were the famous New Mexican 
sopapillas. Because we only had 
to drive through a sliver of New 
Mexico, we weren’t able to stop 
to get them. However, we were 
determined to find somewhere 
in Arizona that sold them. We 
settled on Goyitas, a small, New-
Mexican-owned restaurant right 
in the heart of Tucson. Out of ev -
erywhere we ate, this place was 
the most disappointing. Not be -
cause of the food, but because of 
the price. We took advantage of 
their happy hour menu, where I 
ordered mini chimichangas, and 
my dad ordered loaded tacos. 
The chimichangas were the bet -
ter of the two, lightly fried and 
filled half with beef and half with 
chicken. 
The disappointing part was 
that none of their meals came 
with sopapillas, and each one 
was almost 4 dollars, a steep in -
cline from what we had paid last 
year in New Mexico. But, they 
still were just as airy and came 
with a side of honey as we were 
hoping, so overall we weren’t 
upset that we got them. For it 
to be the main reason we went, 
though, I admit to being unsatis -
fied after our meal. 
Arizona was the last stop we 
made before making it to San 
Diego. I have spoken a lot of the 
restaurants we ate at while driv -ing cross-country, but I do want 
to make a few shoutouts to the 
non-restaurants we stopped at 
along the way. As I mentioned 
before, my one rule was that we 
did not stop somewhere that we 
could go back home. 
We knew while in Texas we 
needed to stop at Whataburger. 
Because of the Hatch New Mexi -
can Chile Festival the week pri -
or, they had a promotional burg -
er with Hatch green chiles that 
I immediately snatched. One 
surprising stop we made was in 
Birmingham, Alabama. I’m not 
sure how popular Milos is on the 
west coast, but in the southeast, 
it is one of the most popular tea 
brands in stores. So imagine our 
surprise when after we made 
a pitstop at Walmart, as we ex -
ited the parking lot, a big neon What I ate Road Tripping from North Carolina to California
red sign exclaiming “Original 
Milos” sat across the street. We 
knew then that we had to stop 
and compare their store-bought 
Arnold Palmer to the restaurant. 
I’m here as a witness to say that 
their Arnold Palmer had the ex -
act blend of sweet and sour we 
were used to. I would even say it 
rivals Cane’s Arnold Palmer, if 
that says anything.
The last place I want to men -
tion before I turn off the ignition 
is a boba shop in Katy, Texas 
(Dad, if you’re reading this, I 
am about to expose you). He 
was looking for a coffee shop 
and asked if I wanted boba. Ob -
viously, I will always say yes to 
boba. We stopped at Long Cof -
fee, where he got a Vietnamese 
Coffee — no boba — and I got 
a tropical SnoBall — strawberry, 
coconut, and pineapple, with 
boba. Before this interaction, he 
would swear up and down that 
he didn’t mind the drinks, but he 
wasn’t a fan of the tapioca pearls. 
But after he tried my drink, his 
new obsession was finding boba 
places, and with each new drink,  
started adding the little fifty-cent 
balls. I won, but at what cost?
At the end of all this, I will 
still say New Orleans was my fa -
vorite food throughout the trip, 
but there wasn’t a place where I 
felt the food was unenjoyable. If 
any of you ever have the chance 
to take a road trip or travel to a 
new area, I encourage you to set 
aside a budget for local eats. Not 
only do you immerse yourself 
in the culture, you contribute to 
the local economy you are visit -
ing, helping them stay afloat for 
years to come.

We all knew this day would 
come, and now here we are. For 
more than two decades, tennis 
fans have been treated to some of 
the greatest performances by two 
of the greatest athletes the sport 
has ever seen. With Serena Wil -
liams and Roger Federer both re -
cently announcing their intention 
to retire from professional tennis, 
many fans around the world can -
not help but feel that it is truly 
the end of an era. To put the sig -
ni/f_icance of this moment into 
perspective, let’s start by looking 
at their accomplishments over the 
course of their careers. 
In 1995, Serena Williams be -
gan her professional tennis career 
at age 14, a year a/f_ter her sister 
Venus began her professional 
career. Four years later in 1999, 
Serena won her /f_irst Grand Slam 
title when she defeated Martina 
Hingis at the U.S. Open. /T_his vic -
tory would mark the beginning 
of a long stretch of dominance 
for Serena, as three years later in 
2002, she won three Grand Slam 
titles by defeating Venus in the 
/f_inals round of that year’s French 
Open, Wimbledon, and U.S. Open 
tournaments. /T_he 2000s were 
when Serena Williams really en -
tered her prime and took over the 
sport. During this time, she held 
winning singles records against 
several of her peers, such as Jen -
nifer Capriati, Justine Henin, and 
Maria Sharapova.The Dawn of  a New Era… and the End of  a Great One
On the /f_irst game of a four 
game road trip, the UC San Di -
ego women’s volleyball team (8–7, 
1–2 Big West) faced oﬀ against 
a struggling UC Riverside team 
(3–9, 1–2 Big West) in a thrilling 
match. UCSD women’s volley -
ball won their last four matchups 
against Riverside dating back to 
1995 and were looking to continue 
that streak. Unfortunately for the 
Tritons, UCR snapped that streak 
and the Tritons ended up losing in 
/f_ive sets, with the /f_inal set ending 
in a tight score of 15–17. 
 /T_he /f_irst set started oﬀ  
very well for UCSD as they were 
able to score the /f_irst two points 
of the set, starting strong. UCSD 
was able to mount a 3-point lead 
at a score of 11–8 oﬀ of a kill from 
sophomore outside hitter Zaria 
Henderson, one of her season-
high 17 on the night. UCR made a 
comeback oﬀ the back of a setting 
error from UCSD and were then 
within one point at a 17–16 score -
line. Eventually, UCSD was able 
to break the Highlander momen -
tum with an excellent kill from 
freshman middle blocker Jasmine 
Saran. /T_he Tritons were able to 
string that kill into two more 
points, bringing their lead up to 
four at a scoreline of 20–16. Soon 
a/f_ter, an error from UCR ended 
the set 25–18 in UCSD’s favor. 
/T_he Tritons comfortably con -
trolled the /f_irst set and now looked 
to go up 2-0 in the match. Unluck -
ily for UCSD, the Highlanders 
were able to jump out of the gates 
hot with a 4-7 lead oﬀ the back of 
a service ace, one of their 15 on 
the night. /T_he Tritons were able to 
claw their way back into the set oﬀ 
of Henderson’s kill, which tied the 
game at sixteen. Although UCSD 
was back in the game, they were unable to handle the serves from 
UCR with back-to-back service 
aces that pushed the Highlanders 
to eventually win the set 22–25. 
Both teams had one set a piece 
going into the third set; this was 
truly anyone’s game now. UCSD 
managed to pull away early from 
the Highlanders oﬀ of a perfect set 
from freshman setter Aubrey Tan -
ner to sophomore outside hitter 
Ava McInnes for a kill that pushed 
the lead to four in a 14–10 game. 
Per usual for this match, UCR was 
able to make a comeback and take 
the lead at a score of 20–24. /T_he 
Tritons, with their back against 
the wall, attempted a late come -
back, scoring three straight points, 
but unfortunately they fell short 
and the Highlanders /f_inished the 
set at a score of 23–25. /T_he Tritons, with the match 
on the line, were determined to 
push this to a /f_i/f_th set. /T_he Tri -
tons started out hot, scoring four 
straight points to take a 9–6 lead. 
Oﬀ the back of a couple errors 
from the Highlanders, the Tritons 
were able to push the lead to four 
points at a 12–8 score. But UCR 
would not go down quietly as they 
/f_ired oﬀ 10 of the next 12 points 
in the game, bringing the score to 
14–18. Fortunately for UCSD, this 
match has been a story of runs and 
comebacks. Oﬀ the back of multi -
ple kills from McInnes and a kill 
from Henderson, the Tritons were 
able to tie the game up at eighteen. 
A/f_ter a strong run from UCR, 
the Tritons were again down, at 
a score of 20–23. With the match 
on the line, the Tritons responded emphatically. UCSD /f_ired oﬀ /f_ive 
straight points with huge con -
tributions coming from middle 
blockers Emily McDaniel and 
Shara Da Silva as they contributed 
three of the /f_ive points at the end 
with their amazing defending, giv -
ing the Tritons a 25–23 win.  
UCSD was able to force a /f_i/f_th 
set with their elite determination 
to win. It was evident that all of 
the momentum was on the Tri -
tons side. A/f_ter multiple McDaniel 
kills, the Tritons were able to jump 
out to an 8–2 lead. Eventually, the 
Highlanders woke up scoring back 
to back service aces once again. 
Continuing oﬀ the two aces, UCR 
was able to tie the set at 11 apiece. 
For the remainder of the set, both 
teams would respond instantly to 
each other going one for one, until the Highlanders were able to stuﬀ 
UCSD at the net, winning the set 
15–17 and the match 3–2. 
UCSD fell to the Highlanders 
on their /f_irst game of the road trip. 
Although they lost, there are posi -
tives to take away with amazing 
performances from Zaria Hen -
derson, Ava McInnes, and Emily 
McDaniel — a strong young core 
for the Tritons. UCSD looks ahead 
to UC Davis on Saturday, Oct. 1 to 
try to bounce back and gain some 
momentum against a diﬃcult Big 
West slate.UCSD Women’s Volleyball Stunned by UC RiversideAs Serena’s career progressed, 
she was consistently ranked as 
the number one women’s tennis 
player by the Women’s Tennis As -
sociation, /f_inishing the year at the 
top spot on /f_ive separate occasions 
and holding that spot for a total 
of 319 weeks in her career. Wil -
liams has a singles career record 
of 858–156 and has won 23 Grand 
Slam titles including seven Aus -
tralian Open titles, seven Wimble -
don titles, six U.S. Open titles, and 
three French Open titles. Serena’s 
23 Grand Slam championships are 
the most of the Open Era and sec -
ond all-time to Margaret Court’s 
24. Serena’s /f_inal Grand Slam title 
was in 2017 when she defeated her 
sister Venus in the /f_inals round 
of the Australian Open, winning 
both sets 6–4. Serena’s /f_inal match 
came in this year’s U.S. Open 
where she was defeated by Alja 
Tomljanović 7–5, 6–7 (4), 6–1 in 
the third round, marking the end 
of her illustrious career. 
About three weeks a/f_ter Ser -
ena Williams’ /f_inal match, Roger 
Federer played his /f_inal match 
alongside longtime rival Rafael 
Nadal, in a 6–4, 6–7 (2–7), 9–11 
doubles loss against Jack Sock and 
Frances Tiafoe at this year’s Laver 
Cup. Despite the two tennis greats 
coming up short in the match, it 
was a treat for tennis fans to see 
Roger and Rafa take the court one 
last time together, but this time as 
teammates. Following the match, 
Roger and Rafa embraced one 
another in what was a very emo -
tional moment for the two, as well 
as for all fans of the sport, mark -ing the end of one of sports’ most 
entertaining rivalries. 
When looking back on the ca -
reer that Roger Federer had, the 
accolades speak for themselves. 
With eight Wimbledon titles, six 
Australian Open titles, /f_ive U.S. 
Open titles, and one French Open 
title, Federer ranks third of all 
time in Grand Slam titles with 20, 
trailing only Novak Djokovic’s 21 
and Rafael Nadal’s 22. Federer also 
maintains a 1251–275 singles re -
cord and was ranked as the num -
ber one men’s tennis player by the 
Association of Tennis Profession -
als on /f_ive separate year-end lists, 
as well as for 310 weeks of his ca -
reer. 
Between these two legends 
retiring, this sport is losing an 
unprecedented amount of talent. 
For many fans of the sport, and 
especially for the younger genera -
tions who began watching tennis 
within the past twenty years, it is 
diﬃcult to believe that two of the 
most dominant athletes of all time 
that made many fall in love with 
the sport are now saying farewell. 
Beyond their many accom -
plishments, the most impres -
sive feat that both Williams and 
Federer have attached to their 
names is longevity. Historically, 
it is quite uncommon for tennis 
players to be playing at such a 
high level well into their thirties 
and forties, especially when tak -
ing into account that a sport like 
tennis is centered around the ath -
lete’s /f_irst-step. However, Roger 
Federer, Serena Willliams, as well 
as Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Venus Williams and several other 
tennis players have been able to 
defy these odds in recent years 
and sustain their excellence for an 
extended period of time. 
It certainly feels like we are 
entering a new era of tennis, as 
many of the players we grew up 
watching are retiring, but as we 
enter this new age, it is important 
to take the time to appreciate the 
greatness we have all been wit -
nesses to for such a long time.
