Beginning Fall 2021, UC San 
Diego will no longer consider 
ACT and SAT scores in admission 
of prospective undergraduates. This follows a unanimous decision by the UC Board of 
Regents to halt the use of the 
SAT and ACT for admissions decisions within the University 
of California due to studies that 
show that these standardized tests have led the UC system to overlook students of color and 
low-income students during the 
admissions process.
These findings follow former 
UC President Janet Napolitano‚Äôs July 2018 request to create a task force researching the effectiveness of standardized 
tests in gauging prospective 
students‚Äô academic ability.
As such, the UC system 
has begun to look into alternative, more equitable means of measuring academic 
performance. Most recently, UC President Michael V. Drake had asked the Academic Senate 
to explore if Smarter Balanced could be adapted to be a suitable 
testing replacement.
Currently, the Smarter 
Balanced Assessment System 
consists of interim and 
summative assessments 
administered throughout and at the end of the school year 
to California public school 
students. It is based on the On Oct. 8, the University of California‚Äôs Office of the President announced 
that it would be issuing a Flu Vaccine 
Mandate Executive Order. This systemwide 
executive order  requires all ‚Äúcovered 
individuals,‚Äù including students, faculty, other academic appointees, and staff who are living, learning, or working on campus, to receive the flu vaccine or opt out by Nov . 19, 2021.
Following the guidelines of the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the executive order issued by the UC system 
provides detailed policies on how to prove 
vaccination status. It also includes the steps for opting out, the available health coverage, and 
implementations of the policy. 
The Executive Order document issued by 
the UC system cites information from the CDC to illustrate the efficacy of the flu vaccine. 
‚ÄúVaccination against the seasonal 
respiratory disease influenza or ‚Äòflu‚Äô has long been accepted as a safe and effective way to 
prevent millions of illnesses and thousands of related doctor and hospital visits every year,‚Äù 
the statement notes.
The CDC‚Äôs Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices (ACIP) has issued recommendations regarding inf luenza 
vaccination for the 2021-2022 season. In the recommendation, ACIP points out that widespread influenza vaccination of people will 
help reduce the strain on healthcare systems. 
‚ÄúPrevention of and reduction in the severity 
of influenza illness and reduction of outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and intensive care unit 
admissions through influenza vaccination also could alleviate stress on the U.S. healthcare 
system,‚Äù the advisory said.
In order to meet the flu vaccination requirements, covered individuals must receive 
or affirmatively decline influenza vaccination. 
Vaccinations will be offered on-site at any 
University location; covered individuals can also go to other alternative clinical sites, but 
they need to provide written documentation to 
the local vaccination authority.
For those who wish to opt out of the 
vaccination requirement, they need to complete 
a Vaccine Declination Statement and submit 
it to the location vaccination authority before Nov. 19, 2021. Masks or face coverings will 
be required for them on campus through the 
end of the flu season ‚Äî even if COVID-19 requirements are loosened.
The university‚Äôs health plans will provide 
coverage for routine health maintenance vaccinations, including seasonal influenza 
vaccines, without copays to covered individuals 
and families.
Each university campus location will 
strongly encourage universal vaccination for all members of the University community, beyond merely covered individuals. These 
might include issuing promotional materials 
and offering vaccine fairs.According to a study published in 2017, the flu vaccine reduced 
hospital visits among adults by around 40%. 
Similarly, a CDC-supported study in 2018 showed that flu shots greatly lessened the risk of severe flu among adults, reduced the 
hospital visits and bed number by 37%, and 
also reduced the risk of being admitted to an ICU with flu by 82%.
The CDC estimated that during the 
last influenza season before the COVID-19 pandemic (2019-2020), 39 to 56 million people 
contracted flu illnesses, resulting in 410,000 to 
740,000 hospitalizations, and 24,000 to 62,000 UCSD Announces

SAT alternative fails to meet UC standards  
Image courtesy of Centers for Disease Control.UC San Diego announced a 
new agreement on Oct. 26 with 
Ford Mobility‚Äôs companies, Spin 
and TransLoc, to steadily enhance transportation methods for the 
35,000 students on campus. The 
new agreement will bring 600 new Spin electric scooters and bikes to campus. TransLoc‚Äôs 
software will provide riders with 
designated Spin charging hubs with digital screens that show 
real-time data on campus transit 
such as bus routes and charging stations.
‚ÄúThe agreement with Ford 
Mobility, Spin and TransLoc ‚Ä¶ brings bike and scooter charging hubs with real-time transit 
information, new technology for 
busses, bicycle and pedestrian counters,‚Äù UCSD Associate 
Communications Director Leslie 
Sepuka said.
This new agreement comes at 
a time when UCSD has seen its largest freshman class of  40,616 students for the 2021-2022 
school year, with many students 
opting to use Spin vehicles to travel around campus. During October 2021, UCSD reported 
that students and faculty took 
63,000 trips using Spin-owned vehicles.
In addition to the probable 
benefits that will be brought about by the agreement, Gary 
Matthews, UCSD Vice Chancellor 
of Resource Management & Planning, told The Times of San Diego that the initiative would 
improve sustainability.
‚ÄúThe university has a long-
standing commitment to reduce our carbon footprint, ‚Äù Matthews 
said. ‚ÄúWith the combined services of Spin and TransLoc, 
the university reduces its carbon 
emissions. ‚Äù 
In December 2017, 50 Spin 
bikes and scooters were brought 
to campus as part of a pilot 
program and 300 more were added weeks later as ridership 
heavily increased. In previous 
years, Spin competed with Bird, another electric scooter company, 
for usage on campus. However, 
as of Summer 2021, Bird is no longer on campus in an effort by 
the university to resolve scooter 
clutter and have designated required parking stations.
‚Äú[We are] currently working 
with SPIN as an exclusive partner on the campus, ‚Äù added Sepuka.
For students who are required 
to travel daily for work or internships, the Spin scooters have been especially beneficial, 
as stated by Sixth College 
sophomore Breanna Tan, who works at a lab far from campus. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad to know that UCSD is 
adding more Spins, ‚Äù Tan said. ‚ÄúI work at a lab almost a mile away By Tianrui Huang  /gid00004/gid00016/gid00015/gid00021/gid0001 /gid00010/gid00003/gid00022/gid00021/gid00010/gid00015/gid00008/gid00001/gid00015/gid00006/gid00024/gid00020/gid00001/gid00024/gid0001 /gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid0001 HEALTH

A.S. Council Brief: Geisel Library and New Budget Allocations
Week 5
At their Week 5 meeting on 
Oct. 27, Associated Students‚Äô 
senators approved several allocations of Programming 
Funds for on-campus activities. 
A.S. also approved several bills, including a resolution to support 
a new textbook affordability 
program.
Arts and Humanities Senator 
Rhianen Callahan began with 
a committee report. Callahan‚Äôs 
committee is planning on revisiting Graduate Family 
House Alcohol policy as well 
as considering designated family parking areas to allow easier 
moving of car seats and children. 
Furthermore, Callahan 
reported from a meeting that 
parts of Geisel Library will be 
under renovation from January 
2022 to June 2022.
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to mainly be 
renovating the main entrance as well as [‚Ä¶] the main waiting room area as well as integrating 
a bit more services for finding 
help in one place,‚Äù Callahan explained. 
Construction will mainly 
happen on the second floor and the library will provide two side exits during that time. However, 
all seats should still be available 
during the construction. Students will receive notifications about it 
as the process begins.
Then, Campus Wide Senator 
Tommy Jung reported the student community responses 
to the first two questions on a student community survey. The survey asked what the student 
community prioritized in terms 
of funding and advocacy. 
The top four responses 
to the first question about allocating funds are: food and housing resources, concerts and events, transportation and 
transformation, and student 
organizations. For the question asking which areas A.S. should focus its advocacy on, 
the top three responses were: 
food and housing resources, health and wellbeing, and 
student organizations tied 
with transportation and transformation. 
Next, A.S. President Manu 
Agni further explained the flu vaccine mandate announced on 
Oct. 8.
‚Äú All students, staff, and faculty 
are required to get the flu 
vaccine, ‚Äù Agni said. ‚ÄúHowever, 
if you don‚Äôt get the flu vaccine, 
there will be no problem. So, it‚Äôs a soft mandate. ‚Äù 
Agni also further explained 
that following the end of fall break during Week 9, residential 
students will be required to 
test upon arrival, while non-residential students won‚Äôt have 
to.
Associate Vice President of 
Local Affairs Aidan Lin then gave an update on the redistricting in 
San Diego, saying that there will be a greater push to reach out to students and have them involved 
in pushing commissioners to 
listen to the A.S. Office of Local Affairs‚Äô proposed Communities 
Collaboration Map. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to mobilize more 
students to support the student 
cause and trying to get UCSD 
campus into District 6, along 
with the off-campus housing that students live in into District 6 as well, ‚Äù Lin explained. 
Lin continued that in a 
community meeting, he met with other community leaders who drafted together a new 
citywide map. About the drafted map, he stated, ‚ÄúIt focuses on 
empowering diverse voices of 
students and communities of 
color in the city of San Diego‚Ä¶ 
with this map behind us, we‚Äôre 
hoping we can rally students and other community members‚Ä¶ onto one map that will empower 
all of us. ‚Äù 
After this, the legislative 
committee went on to approve new appointments, which are as 
shown:
‚Ä¢ Michelle Griffith and Xavier Lopez as First Y ear Senators
‚Ä¢ Anna Zick as Transfer 
Senator 
‚Ä¢ Daniel Soria as Campus

After all of these allocations, 
the remaining funds will be about $135,143.72. For a more detailed explanation and reasoning for these allocations, please refer to 
the recording of A.S. ‚Äôs Week 5 
meeting on their Facebook page. 
  
Week 6
A.S.met again for their Week 
6 meeting on Nov. 3. The Senate 
discussed the Student Promoted 
Access Center for Education and Services (SPACES)‚Äôs new budget 
for the school year, as well as new 
events and appointments. 
The meeting began with a 
presentation by SPACES leaders on the new SPACES budget.According to SPACES Director 
of External Affairs Sophia Sumaray, SPACES repaid A.S. loans using $327,000 worth of rollover funds from last year, 
then reallocated the rest into SPACES programs. 
‚ÄúOur first point of action, of 
course, was that we repay our 
loan back to A.S., ‚Äù Sumaray said. 
‚Äú After that, that left us about 
$287,000, and so the second point of action was that the money was put back into programs that 
received cuts in the last year. ‚Äù 
$46,000 will be allocated to 
Students Programs Ignited for Community Engagement 
& Education (SPICEE). This budget will be put into CORE 
organizations for cultural and 
graduation celebrations, such as a gala for CORE organizations. 
$13,000 will be given to 
Student-Initiated Programs for Holistic Retention (SIPHR), which will be focused into events 
such as ASP Booklending and 
mentee/mentorship programs. 
Finally, the remaining $42,000 
will be given to Student-Initiated Access Programs and Services (SIAPS). This money will be 
given to programs including 
the summer summit, tours for high schools, and summer conferences. 
Then, the A.S. Finance 
Committee discussed bills in their committee. While an allocation 
of $340.49 of programming 
funds to American Chemical Society Student Affiliates has 
been tabled indefinitely, the 
approval of the SPACES budget and an allocation of $9,000 to the Office of Concerts and Events 
was  discharged to the Senate. 
Further, Earl Warren College 
Senator Allyson Muir stated that there will be an event coming out 
to gauge in-person engagement for A.S. events in the future. 
Muir said that students will scan 
a QR code to fill out a feedback 
form about future projects and then spin a wheel for a prize. 
Finally, A.S. will collect 
information and suggestions on increasing mask-wearing compliance, especially in Geisel 
Library, as well as reducing the 
number of offensive sticky note messages on dorm windows. 
Vice President Isaac Lara 
suggested getting house advisors and resident assistants can help 
communicate to students to be 
conscious of what they‚Äôre posting on their windows. 
‚ÄúI feel like if the campus were 
to do it, it would feel like [a] very ‚Äòteacher-telling-student‚Äô way,‚Äù Lara said. ‚Äú[Whereas] if an RA 
or HA does it, it‚Äôs like ‚ÄòI know it‚Äôs 
funny but it might offend some people. ‚Äù
However, Eleanor Roosevelt 
College Senator Isabella Ramos, who is an RA, says that from personal experience, 
residents have been dissident or 
unresponsive. 
‚Äú As much as I want to say they 
listen to us, they don‚Äôt listen to us unless we report them, ‚Äù Ramos explained. 
In terms of mask compliance 
in the library, Senator Rosario suggested library workers can patrol the library to watch for 
people who are not masked. 
‚ÄúFor those people who aren‚Äôt 
wearing masks, maybe [give] a‚Ä¶ first warning and then a 
second warning that they could be blacklisted, ‚Äù Rosario said. 
Lara also reminded that 
marketing promoting mask-wearing has been successful when it emphasizes conscious decision making. 
‚ÄúThe most successful example 
is the one asking to be conscious of where you‚Äôre going, being considerate of the people you‚Äôre going to see, ‚Äù Lara explained. 
‚ÄúSo, more subtle ‚Äî not guilt-
tripping ‚Äî like giving them points like ‚Äòif you‚Äôre going to 
make these decisions, recognize 
how important they could be. ‚Äù 
A.S. Council meetings happen 
at 6 p.m. every Wednesday and are accessible to students. Students can join in by using 
their Zoom link or tuning in on

deaths. The CDC also notes that there 
was an unusually low flu activity during 
the 2020-2021 season, due to mitigation 
measures against COVID-19, such as wearing face coverings, staying home, 
hand washing, school closures, reduced 
travel, increased ventilation of indoor spaces, and physical distancing.
During the coronavirus pandemic, 
contracting COVID-19 has respiratory symptoms similar to influenza. In the following flu season, as both influenza 
and SARS-CoV-2 viruses will be circulating at the same time, ensuring 
universal vaccination against influenza is 
a higher public health priority than it was 
before the pandemic.
According to the California 
government‚Äôs official data, from Oct. 18 to Oct. 24, the average case rate among unvaccinated Californians 16 and older was up to 39.2 per 100,000/day, compared 
to 80.12 between Aug. 22-28. For those 
already  vaccinated against coronavirus, this number dropped to 5.8 per 100,000, 
compared to 10.33 before. Based on current data, unvaccinated people were 
6.8 times more likely to get COVID-19 
than fully vaccinated people.
Statewide positivity rates and 
hospitalizations remain high. Every day, over 4,000 were hospitalized and more 
than 1,000 were treated for COVID-19 in intensive care units.
‚ÄúAs President of the University, I have 
concluded that critical steps must be taken to reduce the
likelihood of severe disease among 
students, faculty and staff, particularly those on campus,
and in turn to reduce the likelihood that 
our health systems will be overwhelmed.‚Äù President Michael V. Drake concluded in the Executive Order. 
Updates to the mandate can be found 
on UC San Diego‚Äôs Return to Learn page. In order to receive a flu vaccine on campus, students can go to MyStudentChart and 
schedule an appointment, and employees 
can visit flu.ucsd.edu.
Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for English language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics. 
Some educators initially welcomed 
the Smarter Balanced year-end state test as a more equitable means of assessing 
students‚Äô academic 
performance because it is based specifically 
on California‚Äôs core 
curriculum. In addition, the Smarter Balanced test is currently a low-stakes 
assessment, and there 
are no test preparation companies dedicated to 
this exam. However, the 
Smarter Balanced Study Group (SBSG) concluded 
that the Smarter Balanced 
assessment would not be a suitable testing replacement.  In a 
letter to the Academic Senate Chair, SBSG co-chairs Mary Gauvain 
and Madeleine Sorapure 
asserted that high school GPA was sufficient to 
predict college first-year 
grades. 
‚ÄúThe SBSG believes 
that the SB assessment is not appropriate as an admissions test, required or optional, for the UC,‚Äú 
they wrote. ‚ÄúThe Smarter 
Balanced 11th grade test scores would add only 
modest incremental value 
beyond high school GPA in predicting college first-
year grades, and would 
likely come at the same cost as the SAT.‚Äù
SBSG continued to explain that the 
Smarter Balanced assessment, similar to the SAT, reflects the disparities in access to 
education, which are marked by race and 
socioeconomic status. They argued that implementing an admissions test would 
inevitably lead to the proliferation of test 
preparation ventures for the assessment, worsening existing inequities. 
Instead of a testing replacement, the 
SBSG proposed a host of recommendations that would aid the UC in achieving its goals in educational equity. 
‚ÄúTo this end, SBSG offers 
recommendations for (1) building a stronger partnership with K-12, (2) 
bolstering the holistic review process, 
(3) expanding and developing resources for students after they enroll at UC, (4) conducting ongoing research regarding the efficacy of the admissions process and student success, and (5) addressing 
capacity limitations,‚Äù the letter said. 
The UCSD Guardian reached out to the 
UCSD Office of Admissions to examine 
how the admission process has since changed with the exclusion of SAT/ACT scores. In their response, the Office of 
Admissions reiterated their commitment 
to a holistic evaluation of each student. 
‚ÄúUC San Diego has long been 
committed to using a holistic process to assess first-year applications, which considers many factors to help understand 
students fully in the context of their 
educational environment, background, 
and experiences,‚Äù someone said. ‚ÄúTest 
scores were one [of 13] factors considered 
in the review of first-year applications for admission. For Fall 2021, we looked 
even deeper into each of the other factors 
considered, learning more about schools, what‚Äôs available to the applicant, rigor, and the context of the applicant‚Äôs educational environment.‚Äù
The 13 factors the admissions committee 
may consider range from special talents, 
such as those in the performing arts or 
athletic endeavours, as well as academic 
achievement and rigour in the context of one‚Äôs educational environment. 
The Office of Admissions also described 
their encouraging observations of the admission cycle this year. During this fall cycle, students could submit their 
SAT and ACT scores, but these were not 
considered during admission.
The Office of Admissions said, 
‚ÄúEliminating the examination requirement may have led to an increase in overall applications, as the Fall 2021 
cycle also marked the highest number of 
applications in UC San Diego‚Äôs history. More than one-third of first year and 
over half of transfer students admitted for 
Fall 2021 were first-generation, with UC San Diego admitting the most transfer students ‚Äî and the most transfer students from California (10,177) ‚Äî among all the 
University of California campuses.‚Äù
To f ind out more information about 
the UC System‚Äôs admission process, prospective students can visit the 
University of California‚Äôs website to learn more. Prospective undergraduates and 
transfers interested in UCSD specifically 
can visit UCSD‚Äôs admission website as well.  ‚ñ∂ HEALTH , from page 1

and a lot of the time it‚Äôs just easier to take a Spin than 
spend 20 minutes walking there and back. ‚Äù
The added charging hubs around campus could 
also prove beneficial as Spin vehicles are powered by a battery that requires frequent charging.
‚ÄúOne time, my Spin almost ran out of battery before I 
could make it home so it is nice to know that there will be more charging hubs on campus, ‚Äù Tan added.
Some students have expressed that there are a lack 
of parking options around campus and many parking areas are not catered to the type of parking permit they may have. Eleanor Roosevelt College sophomore Tyler 
Peterson said that this new agreement could alleviate 
the parking dilemma.
‚ÄúI drive to campus but there are very limited areas 
I‚Äôm allowed to park in and it can be difficult to drive here in general with all the students walking around, so I use Spin a lot, ‚Äù Peterson said. ‚Äú A lot of the time, on my drive to school, I‚Äôll see people park off campus and then 
take a Spin to campus and use it for the day, ‚Äù he added. 
The added Spin vehicles are set to roll out soon. The 
UCSD Guardian will provide further updates on this initiative as information is available.

More than just disillusioned fantasy
Our district, our 
representative. Well actually, 
the wealthy white man‚Äôs 
district, the wealthy white man‚Äôs representative. This is the 
reality many college students 
see when they turn to their local governments. During redistricting when election lines 
are drawn, minority-serving 
institutions are almost twice as likely to be split into multiple 
districts or packed into districts 
where students‚Äô voices are overrun by white landowners. We 
minority students attend these 
institutions by the thousands, yet our grievances and proposals are seldom embraced by those 
who currently claim to represent 
us. With their lawsuits against 
UC San Diego for increasing 
housing density and price gouging, exclusivity remains the affluent Whites‚Äô aim. 
Youth-led solutions are often 
thought of as unrealistic and ignorant of others‚Äô circumstances 
and points of view. Even fellow 
students often shy away from supporting youth-backed plans 
due to feasibility concerns, 
but students‚Äô ideas do have a place in this reality. It is our time as students to find allies, 
take action, and prove that our 
solutions are practical and serve those without the time or money 
to superficially boost an elite-
backed proposal. Our ideas are not limited to preserving the well-being of students. While such a movement may take time to proliferate on a grand scale, 
UCSD students are spearheading 
such a cause on the local level. 
The district lines as they 
stand now grant unfairly high 
population density to some 
districts that have grown tremendously since the last 
census 10 years ago. For 
students in particular, we are 
bound to District 1, which disproportionately represents 
With a median income 
of $118K, the priorities of 
La Jolla landowners vary 
drastically from those of the 
student body. 
the privileged La Jolla 
community. From speaking 
over students, to obstructing 
high-density housing plans, La Jolla and their money, matters 
more than the students‚Äô plight. 
These homeowners, however, are NOT more important than students and any notion that 
they are is disgraceful. In fact 
it is reminiscent of the U.S.‚Äôs colonial past where landowning white men were the only people 
who could vote. Before, this was 
a concern that was being ignored as students were alone in their 
battle. 
As student Tommy Jung 
stated at the commission hearing, 
their wants of ‚Äúsoccer fields, field 
trips, and arbitrary ownership of 
Rose Canyon‚Äù are incompatible with students‚Äô basic need for a 
city that hears our concerns on affordability and representation. 
The feasible option is to 
drastically change these lines. 
The feasible option would be to 
continue to empower historically 
underrepresented voices. But by playing on the notion that 
students are irrelevant, the San 
Diego Redistricting Commission preliminarily approved a map made by their chair that tries 
to maintain the districts as the 
richest on the coast want them. 
But coalition building and listening to others needs 
outside of the student body only 
strengthened our cause. This is how we broke the legitimacy 
barrier that the monied elite had 
created to stop us. 
A map that was supported by 
eight out of nine commissioners 
initially, was shot down by a 
majority, 5‚Äì4, this past week. 
In a historic battle, a map 
proposed and made by students 
in conjunction with community 
leaders and activities has taken 
center stage. Here, UCSD will be drawn into District 6 containing 
Mira Mesa and Convoy to create 
an AAPI empowerment district. Additionally, the map would 
also make other districts into 
Latinx, BIPOC, and LGBTQ+ empowerment districts. An equitable map we drew could 
become the standard for a decade 
of minorities to come.
Why? Because we sought allyship. Because instead of 
saying that the disenfranchised 
were again silenced, we showed them. Maybe they could ignore 
one student. Maybe they could 
ignore one Asian-American. This week we saw what happens when dozens of student organizations, 
of BIPOC organizations, of 
LGBTQ+ organizations among 
others call them out. At the Nov. 4 redistricting commission 
hearing, passionate testimonies 
from the linked arms of students and underrepresented groups forced the commission to check 
their privilege and their bigotry. 
The results thus far have 
been a powerful testament to our undeniable place within political 
decision-making. We have seen the power of a conjoined struggle 
that is empathetic towards 
multiple causes. We have shown 
that students are not just show 
ponies that the neighboring 
communities can profit off of. We are no longer their pets. We are the vermin that the political 
elite can no longer ignore. 
From being caged by oppressive districts to taking control of 
the redistricting conversation, 
students have shattered the bureaucracy‚Äôs glass castle to 
make way for the people‚Äôs palace.

Anti-Feminist Implications of  Hookup Culture in the Media
With the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù college 
experience, comes the pressure 
to have the traditional college 
hook-up experience. While this can seem liberating and 
exciting to have experiences 
with different people and 
encounters, it comes at a 
cost. Quite usually, an anti-
feminist cost. Social media, 
along with the modern-day music industry, insinuate that 
hook-up culture is ‚Äúgirlboss‚Äù 
and liberating for young women, when this is actually the opposite, causing these 
young women to advocate for 
their own objectification. 
Let‚Äôs break this down. 
The idea of women getting to choose their sexual partners and ideals without 
being slut-shamed, sounds 
inviting. Women, in theory, are able to have control over their own pleasure and satisfaction. However, then why is it that only 26% of 
women participating in 
college hookups actually report positive feelings after 
having one? If the feminist 
goal is to advocate for women taking conrol over their own 
sex lives, positive experiences 
and  / or satisfaction should be inferred. With 50% of men 
reporting a positive experience 
after a college hook-up, it is clear that this anti-monotonous hook up culture still caters to 
men. While this is unfortunately 
the reality, social media and the music industry continue to distort this reality as something desirable for women. 
For instance, with the rise 
of female rappers and R&B artists, comes the current rise of ‚Äúbad b----‚Äù music.    Think of 
Megan Thee Stallion, Cardi B, ppcocaine, Doja Cat, etc. While

sexual context. The songs don‚Äôt 
just talk about women being hot, 
but talk about how them being 
hot is sexually beneficial for their partners.This implies that 
the primary thing a female has to 
offer in this world is her body for men to use for their own benefit, 
when in reality the emphasis on 
‚Äúbad b----‚Äù and ‚Äúgirlboss‚Äù music should be talking about things 
that go beyond the physical 
scope. 
Male artists do this as well, 
specifically male rappers. Rarely 
is a woman mentioned in their 
songs for anything but their sexual organs for men to have sex 
with. More times than not as well, it is portrayed in an aggressive, 
almost nonconsensual way. 
Unfortunately, this is the type 
of music that the current college generation and generations 
below are hearing constantly 
through general circulation and social media apps like TikTok.
Along with the anti-
feminist ‚Äúgirlboss‚Äù music that is circulating on TikTok, there are 
dances and trends that promote 
this sexist hook-up culture as well. For example, recently there was a trend where women 
would point the camera to their 
waist area and essentially grind into the camera and post it. 
While obviously women have the autonomy to choose how 
they want to showcase their 
body to society, this trend is 
inevitably objectifying women by diminishing them to physical 
attributes once again. With 
younger girls seeing these influences on TikTok as well, it 
puts pressure on them to 
objectify themselves and 
teaches them to showcase 
their sexual desirability. 
A primary goal of 
TikToks for women is to appear ‚Äúhot,‚Äù without much emphasis on other 
aspects of content that 
could be created. This may seem as though 
women are taking 
control of their own sexual superiority over 
men, but in fact, it turns 
into a competition where women put themselves on a physical pedestal for men to pick from.
The bottom line is 
that although women think they are liberating themselves through 
excess sexual activity, 
the opposite is the case. By making themselves 
more desirable to men 
and then engaging in sexual encounters that 
only benefit the men, women are in reality losing control of their own liberation. Giving men the one thing they want physically 
without the other attachments of 
personality, continues and will continue to reduce women to 
single-use objects that men can 
continue to pick from. 
 
these women are clearly talented 
artists, their lyrics and meaning 
behind the songs they make tend 
to overly romanticize hookup culture, and under the surface, 
objectify women and pin them 
against one another. Doja Cat‚Äôs songs including ‚ÄúFreak Like Me,‚Äù ‚ÄúJuicy,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCandy‚Äù among 
others, repeatedly emphasize 
female physical attributes in a Art by Nicholas Regli for the UCSD Guardian.ARTS & ENTERTAINMENTCONTACT THE EDITOR

‚ÄúNorwegian Wood‚Äù follows uni -
versity students Toru and Naoko 
as they navigate young adulthood in 1960s Tokyo. Stripped down to its bare bones ‚ÄúNorwegian Wood‚Äù is a familiar tale: two people yearning to be together pulled apart by circumstances beyond their control. What makes ‚ÄúNorwegian Wood‚Äù so captivating to read is the internality of its pro-tagonist Toru. He clumsily follows his desires, even when they pull him in opposite directions. Readers experience his anxiety and uncertainty at a painfully close level as he decides what it is he wants and who he wants it from. But it‚Äôs precisely this indecisiveness that makes ‚ÄúNorwegian Wood‚Äù such a relatable novel, even sixty years a /f_ter 
the story‚Äôs setting, the feelings of novelty and fear that come with young adulthood are still a major marker of this stage of life.I‚Äô d be remiss if I were to skip over certain problematic aspects of this novel. ‚ÄúNorwegian Wood‚Äù contains many moments embedded with the male gaze, speciÔ¨Åcally when it comes to the characters‚Äô sexual escapades. /T_his becomes painfully obvious during a scene involv -
ing a piano teacher and her student near the middle of the novel. Many of these scenes feel largely unnecessary, reading more like so /f_t-core porn than like integral and necessary 
parts of the larger story. Nothing that is described in these scenes is essential to the plot outside of the fact that two characters had sex. /T_h ere‚Äôs also a pattern of ‚Äúbroken‚Äù characters 
in the story being largely women, as Murakami condemns them to a tragically lonely and depression-riddled life. Men are written more competently, and though they still suÔ¨Ä er 
through diÔ¨Écult moments, the ones who bear the bludgeon of Murakami‚Äôs pen are by and large the women of the story. ‚ÄúNorwegian Wood‚Äù speaks to young love, the exploration of sexuality, and the pain of ill-fated meetings, but it‚Äôs not without its grave faults. I‚Äôm still largely unsure about how I feel about the novel. It‚Äôs managed to worm its way into my mind, striking many chords as I reÔ¨Çect on its relevance to my life experiences, though I cringe at the reminder of the unpleasant and uncomfortable moments throughout the book. I encourage you to check it out though, maybe it‚Äôll leave you with something great, or maybe you‚Äôll hate it. Whichever it is, you won‚Äôt know until you read it. -EA/f_ter a long summer hiatus S+E Media Club is back! In this issue of the column, 
senior sta Ô¨Ä writer Sarah and A&E Editor Elias give you their short story anthology 
recommendations! It‚Äôs been a long time since the Ô¨Å rst issue of S+E Media Club, and 
we‚Äôve watched a lot of Ô¨Å lms, seen a lot of TV , and listened to a lot of music in that 
time. We wanted to do something a little di Ô¨Äerent for this issue though, so we‚Äôll be 
covering a medium that‚Äôs very dear to our hearts: books. From short story anthologies 
to full novels, these are four of our favorite books from the summer.
‚Äú A/f_terparties‚Äù is the late Anthony Veasna So‚Äôs Ô¨Årst published collection of short stories, 
released eight months a /f_ter the 28-year-old‚Äôs death. In this short story anthology the late 
author gives readers a tour of his hometown of Stockton, CA. A sort-of love letter to his hometown, So explores what it‚Äôs like growing up in a forgotten corner of the most famous 
U.S. state. We‚Äôre invited into the lives of the Cambodian-American community that calls 
Stockton home, some of whom are business owners, some are students or recent college 
graduates, and some are somewhere in between, all connected through their experiences as refugees and as children of refugees.‚Äú A/f_terparties‚Äù is a deep examination of generational trauma, as readers see many sec-
ond- and third-generation Cambodian American characters deal with the eÔ¨Ä ects of the 
Khmer Rouge genocide that their parents survived. Bubbling up in moments of conÔ¨Çict between the younger and older generations, So paints a harrowing picture of how trauma transcends space and time, touching those who have passed away, those who are still alive, and those who are yet to be born. /T_h e trauma of his characters is only further exacerbated 
by the poverty that surrounds the community. But even among all the doom and gloom, the inhabitants of this book are able to Ô¨Ånd pockets of joy: they fall in love, get a little too drunk at the family party, and reconnect with estranged family members. ‚Äú A /f_terparties‚Äù 
captures the joyful melancholia that seems to permeate the lives of us immigrants and our children, making it a must read for anyone who‚Äôs ever felt simultaneously at home and a stranger in their family, culture, and life. -E
As the title of Sally Rooney‚Äôs newest novel ‚ÄúBeauti -
ful World, Where Are You‚Äù suggests, the post-COVID world can often appear bereft of wonder. Both pro -
tagonists of the novel, Alice and Eileen, approach such existentialism with a mixture of frustration and tact. They shuttle between hookups, question the relevance of celebrity amidst a class war, and struggle to maintain a semblance of their formerly close-knit relationship. Alice and Eileen, in their sporadic yet meaningful email conversations, bear witness to the end of aesthetics and genuine connection. To them, the world and all that it VLJQL√ÄHVKDVEHFRPHLQFUHDVLQJO\LQYLDEOHEHDXW\LVreplaced with self-interest is replaced with the domina -
tion of capitalism. Rooney writes with exacting style and an acute aware -
ness of social relations ‚Äî especially those between out -
siders and individuals in power. Indeed, some parts of the novel read like excerpts from Rooney‚Äôs own personal essays instead of character explorations in a long-form novel. Alice, in particular, is Rooney‚Äôs self-insert. She focuses primarily on the intersection of DXWKRUVKLSDQGFHOHEULW\ZKHUH$OLFHSRQGHUVGRDXWKRUV√ÄWLQWRWKHODUJHUZHERIZRUN -

Though it seems that all is futile in the ever-increasing cycle of capitalist destruction, Rooney imbues her novel with an underlying sense of hope. As long as we cling to love and friendship, Rooney asserts, the world will always be beautiful. -SRelegated to the conÔ¨Ånes of high school English classrooms, short stories have all but 
disappeared from our consumption of mainstream literature. In his new collection, ‚ÄúFilthy 
Animals, ‚Äù Brandon Taylor rea Ô¨Érms the role of short stories in the literary canon. Each 
selection explores fraught relationships between characters and delves into the minutiae 
of love and longing. /T_h ere is indeed much of Taylor‚Äôs empathetic prose littered through -
out the stories; it is witnessed in the nuanced portraits of queer relationships, in the taut 
descriptions of post-breakup revelations, and in the raw portrayal of mental illness amidst a backdrop of garish university functions. In the carefully cra /f_ted opening story ‚ÄúPotluck, ‚Äù 
Taylor considers graduate school drop-out Lionel with emotional detachment, yet does not fail to map out Lionel‚Äôs subtle grasps at a Ô¨Äection. Lionel‚Äôs saga is expanded in the sto -
ries ‚ÄúFlesh, ‚Äù ‚ÄúProctoring, ‚Äù ‚Äú Apartment, ‚Äù and  ‚ÄúMeat, ‚Äù where he Ô¨Ånds himself caught in the middle of an emotional battleÔ¨Åeld between two college-aged dancers.‚ÄúFilthy Animals‚Äù is Brandon Taylor at his most comfortable ‚Äî introspective, quietly devastating, and emo -

ever a/f_ter moved me to tears. If you asked me why, I don‚Äôt think I could exactly explain it. 
It was the novelty, I think, of seeing South Asian women Ô¨Ånding joy that le/f_t me awestruck. It served as conÔ¨Årmation to me that success was whatever I chose to make of it, and that it 
was something I deserved. It was not at all what I expected, but it was beautiful nonethe-less. And that, I think, is how to best describe my experience at SDAFF. Among the jokes, 
satire, drama, and documentaries, there was an unmistakable undercurrent of bittersweet 
joy at seeing Asian stories on the big screen. Every movie was an explosive celebration of culture, but the novelty of the experience served as a painful reminder of the lack of Asian 
representation in today‚Äôs media. We‚Äôve heard the word ‚Äúrepresentation‚Äù thrown around a 
lot in recent years, but rarely do we see it executed successfully. Simply put, art hits diÔ¨Ä er-
ently when you know that every person on the cast and crew is committed to shining the 
spotlight on underrepresented communities. 
For me, representation meant watching an entire theater light up to ‚ÄúSheila Ki Jawani‚Äù and 
‚ÄúMalang‚Äù in Geeta Malik‚Äôs ‚ÄúIndia Sweets and Spices. ‚Äù ‚ÄúIndia Sweets and Spices‚Äù follows UCLA freshman Alia, who is fed up with her uber-rich family and friends‚Äô shallowness 
and befriends the family who owns the local Indian grocery store. No matter how rich and 
hypocritical the characters were, I saw my friends and family reÔ¨Çected in Alia‚Äôs commu-
nity. Watching Indian excellence celebrated on screen, glamorously decked out in glittering 
outÔ¨Åts and luxurious cars, made me proud beyond words. /T_h e rich storytelling and the 
attention to detail felt like a warm hug; reassurance that someone like me could be the star 
of their own story. To see aspects of my life ‚Äî albeit exaggerated versions of it ‚Äî play out 
on screen was an experience I won‚Äôt forget. When I asked Geeta Malik about the personal 
inspiration behind the Ô¨Å lm, she reÔ¨Çected on how weekend Indian get-togethers served 
as a hotbed for culture and community during her childhood, leaving me feeling like she 
took the words right out of my mouth. Watching Malik address the theater, it felt like a 
spectacular future was within reach ‚Äî one where a movie with an all-Indian cast could be 
a blockbuster. 
I felt a similar sense of hope a /f_ter watching ‚Äú7 Days. ‚Äù Taking place right as the COVID-19 
pandemic unfolded in March 2020, ‚Äú7 Days‚Äù tells the story of Ravi and Rita, whose pain -
fully awkward Ô¨Årst date becomes unexpectedly elongated when the two are forced to quar -
antine together. From a soulful examination of arranged marriages to a tearful monologue 
on the cultural importance of the romantic drama ‚ÄúKal Ho Naa Ho, ‚Äù Roshan Sethi‚Äôs quirky 
pandemic rom-com was Ô¨Årmly rooted in Indian culture; but it also spoke to universal 
themes of loneliness and love, confusion and desperation, and the importance of connec-
tion. Listening to Sethi explain the creative process that led him to write ‚Äú7 Days‚Äù with his 
boyfriend Karan Soni while in residency, I intuitively knew that the future of Asian Ameri -
can cinema is in good hands. Sethi and Soni‚Äôs process meticulously aimed to capture the 
internal tug of war between traditional customs and western thinking, and it is the unique 
kind of story that could only have been written by Asian Americans.
/T_he Asian American immigrant experience is one which values resilience, resourcefulness, 
and thri/f_t; so it comes as no surprise that Asian American Ô¨Å lmmakers have managed to 
create such wonderful art even in the face of countless obstacles. Bringing Asian culture to 
the movies has been ‚Äî and continues to be ‚Äî an uphill battle, but attending SDAFF made 
me realize that we still have a Ô¨Åghting chance if we band together. /T_h ese and many other 
Ô¨Ålms from SDAFF will be playing in theaters across the country, where anyone can walk in 
and experience the beauty and joy of the Asian American experience. I encourage anyone 
with the opportunity to do so to buy a ticket and show up for these artists. /T_h ere is no 
lack of talented Asian Ô¨Å lmmakers; there is only a lack of support for their work. Attend-
ing SDAFF granted me a vision of what mainstream Asian American art could look like. 
/T_his world has largely been pushed out of the spotlight, but I can‚Äôt wait for the day when it 
Ô¨Ånally takes center stage.

Festival (SDAFF), hosted from Oct. 28 - Nov. 6.A/f_ter many failed endeavors to portray ‚ÄúDune‚Äù on the big screen, Denis Villeneuve has 
taken a  shot at depicting the complex and imaginative world of Paul Atreides and Ar -
rakis. /T_h e novel by Frank Herbert, which has sold over 20 million copies, and has been 
deemed as one the ‚Äúgreatest science Ô¨Åction books ever written. ‚Äù /T_he Ô¨Ålm which runs 2 
hours and 35 minutes long, covers only half of the 800 page novel.

/gid00051/gid00064/gid00083/gid00068/gid00067 : PG-13Villeneuve‚Äôs casting in the Ô¨Å lm is spot on. Timothee Chalamet Ô¨Å ts the mold of a 15-year-
old who is in a place of power without awareness of how to use it and Rebecca Ferguson 
as his caring yet authoritative mother works well. /T_h e Ô¨Ålm also does an impressive job 
incorporating all of the nuances of ‚ÄúDune‚Äôs‚Äù complex universe. /T_h e Ô¨Ålm requires lots of 
exposition: the witchlike behavior of the Bene Gesserit, the prophecy of Muad‚ÄôDib, the brooding threat of the Harkonnens, and the secretive ways of the Fremen. /T_h e explanatory 
dialogue may feel tedious to those who already read the novel, but runs smoothly for those 
who haven‚Äôt. Despite this, the Ô¨Å lm‚Äôs explanations are somewhat surface-level and admitted-
ly the logic of the Ô¨Å lm‚Äôs events might not make sense to the latter. To counteract this lack 
of context, Villenevue hints at larger things brewing below the surface (both literally and Ô¨Åguratively) He foments this speculation through Paul‚Äôs dreams; montages of a character we later meet, Chani (Zendaya), who we can assume will be signiÔ¨Åcant in Paul‚Äôs upcoming 
journey among the Fremen.
While missing the psychedelic ambiance that Herbert originally intended for his novel, 
Villeneuve‚Äôs portrayal is consistent with his personal style, cold and soulless as seen in 
‚Äú Arrival‚Äù and ‚ÄúPrisoners. ‚Äù While the Ô¨Å lm may have beneÔ¨Å ted more from using a more 
evocative and bright design emblematic of the desert heat, Villeneuve‚Äôs vision places more 
emphasis on the futuristic aspects of ‚ÄúDune. ‚Äù His depiction stands in complete contrast with what other directors imagined the Ô¨Å lm to be. David Lynch directed the dreadful 1984 
adaptation of ‚ÄúDune, ‚Äù a Ô¨Å lm with a lackluster narrative and menial imagery. Alejandro 
Jodorowsky, a Chilean Ô¨Å lmmaker in the 1970‚Äôs, aspired to make ‚ÄúDune‚Äù a psychedelic 
experience. /T_h e Ô¨Ålm was set to star David Carradine and Salvador Dali, with music by 
Pink Floyd. However, the Ô¨Å lm was never made as Hollywood studios deemed the project 
too costly.‚ÄúDune‚Äù relies heavily on its visuals to gravitate viewers towards the Ô¨Å lm. Images of sand-
storms, desert cities, and high-tech space ships are compelling. Villenevue infuses this imagery with a more human aspect, with continuous images of Chani within the desert landscape looking back at the audience. Unfortunately, the marketing of the Ô¨Å lm geared 
too heavily toward Zendaya‚Äôs character, whom we only get to meet  at the end of the Ô¨Å lm. 
Chani‚Äôs character is le/f_t in the air without any major developments yet she appears in most of the advertising. /T_his loosely applies to character relationships in the Ô¨Å lm as well, which 
were not fully developed. Exploring Duke Leto and Lady Jessica‚Äôs love for each other would‚Äôve added dimension to their seemingly cold relationship as well as provide context for the Bene Gesserit‚Äôs distaste for Lady Jessica and Paul. For now, audiences will have to wait to see whether or not such characters will be further explored in 2023‚Äôs Dune Part Two.

Find the survey at linktr.ee/ucsdasce/T_he night is young, the sky 
is clear, a brisk evening breeze 
brushes against my cheeks as I 
stroll along Scholars Drive. I have 
nowhere to be, nowhere to go. 
/T_here is no destination in mind, 
but there is something I seek. 
I‚Äôve been waiting all day for this, 
waiting for the cover of darkness and the silence of the streets. It‚Äôs not too busy, and for that I am grateful. Tonight is the perfect 
atmosphere for my long awaited hunt. 
I‚Äôm restless and excited, but 
I‚Äôm careful to play it cool. I re -
mind myself to not walk too fast, 
to be discreet as I survey the 
scene. I can‚Äôt come o Ô¨Ä as too ea -
ger, they‚Äôll sense it. I‚Äôve selected 
my path carefully, only divert -
ing from the main street so that I can linger near the areas I know that they frequent. I glance over at the over Ô¨Çowing trash cans, 
peek into the sewer drains, and eye any tree that seems to show suspicious movement. My sur -
veying is to no avail, I have yet to set eyes on the one thing that I‚Äôve been dreaming about. 
Over an hour has passed and 
my eyelids have grown heavy. I‚Äôm losing my alertness, my stride turning into trudging. It‚Äôs time to accept defeat and re -
turn home. With a heavy heart, I open the door to my room, glancing back one more time at the sewer across from my build -
ing, a sliver of hope remaining. 
I wait for a moment but see no 
new developments and I slam 
my door, squashing what little 
optimism I had le /f_t. I lay in bed 
while clicking through stories. 
And that‚Äôs when I see some -
thing ‚Äî something that makes my blood boil. I am infuriated as I watch the Snapchat story of 
an acquaintance. On my phone 
are three mischievous faces with large round eyes and little 
nimble Ô¨Ångers. I look around 
at the surroundings and that‚Äôs 
when my anger is unleashed. 
Adding insult to injury, the vid -
eo documents those little ras-
cals crawling out of the sewer 
beside my building. /T_he very 
sewer I had glanced upon only 
moments before.
I‚Äôm enraged. I like to give ev -
eryone the bene Ô¨Åt of the doubt, 
but the evidence is damning and 
my already growing suspicions 
have been con Ô¨Årmed. /T_hose 
sneaky bastards are playing a 
game with me, a game of hide 
and seek, of cat-and-mouse. 
/T_hey taunt me with celebrity ap -
pearances on @ucsd.raccoons. 
/T_hey make their presence known 
to every other student but me. 
Friends Ô¨Çaunt their sightings 
and look at me with pity when 
I reveal my truth. Every person 
I‚Äôve asked has admitted to hav -
ing seen at least one raccoon on 
campus and the fact that I have 
not has ostracized me, alienating 
me from my peers. If anyone is 
keeping track, the current score -
board would likely show: Rac -
coons‚Äì100 Emily‚Äì0. 
I lived on campus all of last 
year and for the entirety of this year so far. Yet they have suc -
cessfully evaded me at all costs. 
/T_his is no coincidence ‚Äî this is 
personal. /T_hey have to actively 
work on avoiding me, especially 
given the frequency in which I 
seek them out. Sometimes I can sense them watching me, snick -
ering at me, conspiring against 
me. But I refuse to let them win. 
/T_hey‚Äôve been carrying the game 
for months, but I‚Äôm determined. At least one of them will slip up, I just know it. And the moment 
that it happens, the moment I 
catch a glimpse of one of their 
naughty little faces, I can claim 
victory.

Examining the journey of  Valeria Rodriguez,

Art by Angela Liang for the UCSD Guardian. 
By Oishee Misra
/gid00020/gid00047/gid00028/gid00033/gid00033/gid00001/gid00024/gid00045/gid00036/gid00047/gid00032/gid00045
Valeria Rodriguez, a first-year at 
UC San Diego and a first-generation 
college student, commutes to UCSD 
everyday. It takes her 35 minutes to an hour depending on traffic, and 
then she parks at Gliderport ‚Äî $30 
per day for on-campus parking is too expensive ‚Äî and then walks to campus. 
This parking issue is one 
of the many problems which help highlight the burden faced 
by financially insecure college 
students, particularly first-generation college students. 
Just like in Valeria Rodriguez‚Äô 
case, sometimes students commute and walk because housing and 
parking is not affordable, or they 
work jobs along with doing school in order to afford college. 
According to Valeria Rodriguez, 
even parking at Gliderport is often challenging because there are so 
many students that can‚Äôt afford 
on-campus parking.
However, Valeria Rodriguez does 
cite that UCSD carries resources that have helped her personally 
as a first-generation student. For example, she has attended events 
hosted by the Raza Resource Centro 
and workshops called Cafecito Hours. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm able to talk to more students 
like me,‚Äù Valeria Rodriguez told the UCSD Guardian. ‚ÄúI feel like I do have that help to go to ‚Ä¶ I 
went to Cafecito Hours a few days 
ago and we were able to talk about anxiety and time management, and 
see what could be helpful for us.‚ÄùA Ô¨Årst-year and Ô¨Å rst-generation college student at UCSD shares her and 
her family‚Äôs story, including her experiences with the college application 
process, her current life and her future plans. 
Valeria Rodriguez‚Äôs parents 
immigrated to the United States from Mexico. Her mom, Laura 
Rozano, moved to the U.S. when she was 14 and managed to get a 
high school diploma.
‚ÄúIt was a bit of a struggle 
because not a lot of teachers 
spoke Spanish, so it was hard to 
communicate,‚Äù Rozano said. ‚ÄúI 
was the first one in the family to graduate with a high school 
diploma, but the majority of my 
siblings dropped out of high school from how difficult it was.‚Äù
Similarly, Valeria Rodriguez‚Äôs 
dad, Valentin Rodriguez, found that his parents struggled to afford sending him and his 
siblings to school. He completed 
primary school in Mexico, but after that, began working 
at a young age and eventually 
immigrated to the U. S. with his cousins. 
Both Valentin Rodriguez and 
Rozano feel as if most people don‚Äôt recognize that having a 
college education in the United 
States is a privilege. A college degree opens doors; Valentin Rodriguez recalls that when 
he started job hunting, he felt 
extremely limited. 
As a result of their sparse 
educational backgrounds beyond high school, Valeria Rodriguez‚Äôs parents were unable to provide 
guidance about the various 
aspects of the college application process, such as supplemental essays and financial aid.
In order to complete her 
college applications, Valeria Rodriguez received a lot of help 
during her senior year of high school from the AVID program 
she was in. 
Through AVID, a nonprofit 
focused on increasing equity in education, Valeria Rodriguez 
received feedback from her high 
school alumni for the Personal Insight Questions portion of the UC Application. 
However, it was challenging 
to fill out the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student 
Aid) by herself. Valeria Rodriguez‚Äôs 
parents gave her the documents and information she needed, but 
she had to figure out how to fill 
out the application itself.
After the college application 
process was over and Valeria 
Rodriguez had received 
acceptances, it was difficult for her to narrow down her options 
because the financial aid she was 
given wasn‚Äôt enough. 
Most types of financial aid 
require the student to demonstrate financial need (some exceptions include federal loans and 
scholarships). UC schools will help 
students receive federal financial aid (if eligible), but limited UC financial aid is available to help 
cover tuition costs. 
Valeria Rodriguez ended up 
choosing UCSD because it was at a commutable distance from her 
home, so she could save money by not requiring housing. 
Over the summer, Valeria 
Rodriguez was a part of UCSD‚Äôs Summer Bridge Program, which 
helped her become acquainted with the college and also made 
registering for classes easier 
because she had a mentor that helped her with course selection.Valeria Rodriguez is adjusting 
to college life as a first-generation student, and her little sister, Militza Rodriguez, is currently a 
high school freshman who hopes 
to follow in her footsteps in a couple of years.
The conversations between 
Valeria Rodriguez and Militza Rodriguez center around meeting 
new people, doing work for their 
classes, and learning new things. Militza Rodriguez usually leaves the conversations with a sense of 
excitement.   
When Valeria Rodriguez was 
going through high school, she says that when she struggled 
with schoolwork, she remembers self-teaching herself confusing 
concepts using the internet or 
waiting until the following day to ask her teachers or peers questions 
about homework.
However, now, she can support 
her sister and plans to continue 
to support her when she has to 
go through the college application 
process.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm more aware of what she 
can do because for me, I was questioning myself, ‚Äòlike is this the right thing?‚Äô‚Äù Valeria Rodriguez 
said. ‚ÄúAnd it would cause me to 
feel so overwhelmed and just overthink, and it really took a toll on my mental health senior 
year, because I felt like I wasn‚Äôt 
succeeding or going down the right path. So any concerns she 
has, she can come to me whether 
it‚Äôs mentally or just like trying to solve a problem.‚Äù
Valeria Rodriguez remembers 
that when she was younger, her dad instilled the belief in her that if she dreams big, she has to work hard to achieve those big dreams. 
Now, Valeria Rodriguez says 
that even seemingly small things, 
like when he asks about her day 
when she commutes home after a long day at UCSD, helps boost her 
morale and serves as emotional 
support.
In contrast, Valeria Rodriguez 
mentioned that students who aren‚Äôt first-generation college students can make her feel inferior ‚Äî for instance, when she asks a 
question that may come across as 
obvious to someone with a family that‚Äôs more familiar with college, 
they give her a ‚Äúfunny face.‚Äù 
She emphasized that being 
respectful and kind can go a long way ‚Äî simply a smile or 
answering a question in a way that isn‚Äôt condescending can give first-
generation students the moral 
support that they need. 
Valeria Rodriguez is majoring 
in political science, focusing on 
race, ethnicity and politics. She 
hopes to attend law school one day. 
‚ÄúI just want to tell first-
generation students that I‚Äôm proud of them,‚Äù Valeria Rodriguez 
said. ‚ÄúAny step they‚Äôve taken, I‚Äôm 
proud of them because it‚Äôs so difficult when you feel like you‚Äôre by yourself and you feel like you 
aren‚Äôt going down the right path. 
But I feel like each one of us has a purpose.‚Äù
As for Valeria Rodriguez‚Äôs 
parents, they would like to tell other first-generation college 
students: ‚Äúsi se puede.‚ÄùMON11.8

HOLOCAUST MEMORY AND GRAPHIC NOVELS /endash.case WITH MIRIAM KATIN /hyphen.case ZOOM
Among the countless tragic events making 
up the colossal tragedy of the Shoah, none 
is more shocking than perhaps the mass 
deportation of Hungarian Jews in 1944. In 
just a few short months, more than 440,000 men, women and children were deported to Auschwitz and almost inevitably murdered on arrival. Thanks to false papers, 2-year-old Miriam Katin escaped this gruesome fate. In 2006, drawing on her mother‚Äôs memories of the Holocaust, Katin published ‚ÄúWe Are on Our Own,‚Äù a graphic novel inspired by Art Spiegelman‚Äôs ‚ÄúMaus.‚Äù Katin trained as a graphic artist in Israel and is the recipient of the Inkpot Award and the Prix de la critique. Her work has been featured in the 2007 and 2014 volumes of ‚ÄúThe Best American Comics.‚Äù She will be introduced by Elizabeth Pollard, a historian and founding member of the Comics Studies Collaborative at San Diego State University (SDSU).

UC San Diego‚Äôs men‚Äôs water 
polo team finished off their 
last week of the Western Water 
Polo Association (WWPA) 
conference season on a positive 
note, with an emphatic 16‚Äì8 win 
against Santa Clara University 
on Thursday, followed by a tight 
11‚Äì10 victory against UC Davis on Saturday.
Against No. 20 Santa Clara 
on the road, No. 12 UCSD 
added to their winning streak 
in their penultimate conference 
match of the season, securing 
a decisive 16‚Äì8 victory away against the Broncos. After a bit 
of a slow start, the Tritons grew 
into the game in the second 
quarter and took over the lead 
just before halftime, which 
would set the tone for the rest 
of the game. This win sealed the Tritons‚Äô fifth conference 
win and 12th overall win of the season. 
The scoring was kicked off  
by the home side, with Santa 
Clara center Cody Ferguson 
scoring 2 back-to-back goals 
within the first minute of play. 
The Tritons pulled back a 
point less than a minute later, courtesy of a goal by redshirt 
junior utility player Manuel 
Augusto. San Diego‚Äôs redshirt 
senior utility player Karlo 
Krmek also added his name to 
the scoresheet, but only after 
the Broncos retaliated with a goal by Chase Raisin; the first 
period ended 4‚Äì2 to the home 
side.
The second quarter saw a 
shift, with UCSD getting into more of a rhythm. The Tritons 
struck first after the break, 
again with Augusto bringing 
the scoreline to just a single-
goal difference. It looked like 
Santa Clara would hold onto their lead for longer after 
Ferguson scored his third goal 
just 12 seconds later, but the 
Tritons rallied to overtake by the end of the quarter 
thanks to goal contributions 
by redshirt sophomore utility 
player Brendan Nugent, Karlo 
Krmek, redshirt junior utility 
player Vedran Latkovic and 
redshirt senior utility player Calder Hilde-Jones. Especially 
noteworthy were Krmek‚Äôs goal 
from a penalty and Latkovic‚Äôs powerplay capitalizing on a Santa Clara exclusion.
The second half saw a 
dominant UCSD side score 9 
more goals. Less than 2 minutes 
into the third quarter, redshirt 
sophomore utility player Kaden 
Likins scored his first of the game. His was followed by 
Augusto‚Äôs third, a second each 
by Nugent and Hilde-Jones and 
a last-second goal by Krmek to 
round off his 3 of the afternoon. 
Santa Clara‚Äôs Jake Taylor and 
Ford Eldredge scored 2 for the 
home side to cut the Triton lead 
to 12‚Äì7. 
The Tritons capped off their 
impressive performance with 4 
more goals in the last period. 
Hilde-Jones scored twice more 
and Latkovic added a second to 
his total, with redshirt senior utility player Alex Zamanian 
finding the back of the net with 
less than three minutes to go to 
soundly secure the victory for 
the visitors. At the other end of 
the pool, redshirt sophomore 
goalkeeper Alexander Nemeth put in an important defensive 
shift with 7 saves and 3 steals. 
Two days later, the Tritons 
headed away their Saturday 
match-up with No. 9 Davis, 
riding the momentum of their 
earlier victory against Santa Clara. The Aggies proved to 
be a bigger challenge for the 
visitors, but a last-minute battle 
by UCSD to hold their narrow 
lead let them eke out a win 
against a tough opponent to 
notch their third consecutive 
win.
UCSD started well, opening the scoring with a goal by Kaden Likins. This was followed up 
with a goal by Davis‚Äôs Aleix 
Aznar Beltran, setting the tone 
of the game with the beginnings 
of a close tug-of-war contest 
between two evenly-matched sides. Hilde-Jones got on the 
scoresheet less than a minute 
later to regain the lead for San Diego. The Tritons gave up a penalty just before the 3-minute 
mark, but UC Davis was unable 
to capitalize on the opportunity. 
The tight race continued 
with the visitors adding to 
their goal count after Hilde-
Jones scored his second, only to be countered by a goal from 
UC Davis‚Äôs Logan Anderson. A 
powerplay from Krmek added 
to the Tritons‚Äô lead, but goals by 
Nir Gross and Anderson within 
the last two minutes tied the 
score for the Aggies at the end of the period at 4‚Äì4.
The second quarter began 
with a number of fouls resulting 
in exclusions for three UCSD 
players and a yellow card for 
head coach Denny Harper at 
the 6:21 mark. After a Davis 
timeout, the home side took the lead from a goal by Michael 
Plastino. A pair of goals from 
the Tritons followed, one being 
a penalty converted by Vedran 
Latkovic. The half was seen 
out with no more goals but 
another yellow card, this time awarded to UC Davis‚Äô Aaron 
Voggenthaler.
The third quarter saw the 
resurgence of the back-and-
forth that largely characterized 
this tense fixture, with the score 
yo-yoing between the sides after Logan Anderson evened for the 
Aggies. This was soon followed 
by alternating goals by UCSD‚Äôs 
Krmek and Davis‚Äô Connor 
Norton. The Aggies took the 
lead with three minutes left in 
the quarter after Aznar Beltran 
scored again, but were unable 
to maintain the edge for long: another penalty awarded to 
the Tritons saw Latkovic again 
convert the opportunity to 
re-tie the score. Things heated 
further when Davis retook 
the lead and with less than 20 
seconds to go, UC Davis head coach Daniel Leyson matched 
Harper with a yellow card of 
his own. The third quarter ended with UC Davis holding a narrow 9‚Äì8 edge.
The final period of the 
match saw the scoreline go 
down to the wire. UCSD evened 
the tally with Krmek finding 
the back of the net to seal his 
hat trick, and then pulled ahead with a second goal by Latkovic 
and third by Hilde-Jones 
with 41 seconds remaining. It 
took commendable grit and 
determination for the Tritons 
to protect their lead, and despite 
another goal by Davis‚Äô Plastino 
in the last 30 seconds, the 
visitors held on to secure the 
win, 11‚Äì10.
It was a well-won victory, 
with an impressive display from 
both the offense and defense ‚Äî 
goalkeeper Alexander Nemeth 
put up 11 saves and 2 steals on the occasion to round out a 
tough contest.
This win gave the Tritons 
their sixth conference and 13th 
overall win. UC Davis suffered 
their first conference loss this 
season, and the result was especially sweet for the Tritons 
after their overtime loss just 
over a month ago to the Aggies 
at the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation (MPSF) Invitational. 
With the season winding 
down, the Tritons come back home to play the San Francisco 
Olympic Club on Saturday, 
Nov. 13 before heading back 
up to Davis to participate in 
the WWPA Tournament the 
following weekend.Water Polo Closes out

UC San Diego women‚Äôs 
volleyball (8‚Äì16, 5‚Äì8 Big West) has had a rough go of it in 
recent weeks, facing injuries 
down the stretch of their Big 
West schedule. Against UC 
Davis (9‚Äì15, 5‚Äì8 Big West), the 
Tritons seemed competitive, but similar to many recent matches, 
had a difficult time filling the 
roles of missing players. UCSD 
lost in four sets, 20‚Äì25, 18‚Äì25, 
25‚Äì18, 18‚Äì25, and there were 
certainly some good signs in 
the performance from the team‚Äôs young players despite the 
circumstances. 
The match started off close, 
with UCSD‚Äôs senior setter 
Isabela Dobra setting the tone 
with her energy and control. A 
kill set up by Dobra was scored by freshman outside hitter 
Zaria Henderson, and the first 
set‚Äôs deficit was cut to one with 
a score of 8‚Äì9. The Tritons were 
having trouble up front to start this match, with UC Davis‚Äô run 
coming after scoring a slew of 
kills after the Tritons struggled 
to get a kill off. A few sets 
from junior libero Naya Dong 
brought the Tritons within 
striking distance at 20‚Äì24, but ultimately UCSD was not able 
to capture the first set, and 
would need to find some power 
close to the net for this match to 
remain competitive. After going down 7‚Äì3 
early in the second set, UCSD seemed like they were in trouble 
again before putting together 
a short 3‚Äì0 run highlighted by a kill from up-and-coming 
sophomore opposite Grace 
Cannon. The Tritons again 
struggled on defense and were 
getting outplayed close to the 
net, while also allowing an ace. 
The game seemed like it was quickly getting out of hand, when senior libero Susanna Limb got an ace of her own to cut the lead to 17‚Äì12. The Dobra-
Henderson connection worked 
again, and UCSD slowly worked 
their way back into the set at 
20‚Äì17. Still, the Tritons were in 
a precarious spot but seemed to 
have all the momentum. Instead 
of capitalizing, however, the 
Tritons dropped five of the next six points to lose the set 25‚Äì18 
in a demoralizing set two loss. 
While the second set couldn‚Äôt 
have helped team morale, the 
Tritons came back with a healthy mindset and started to look like 
the fiery team we‚Äôre accustomed 
to seeing. UCSD jumped out 
to a 6‚Äì2 lead spearheaded by 
one of freshman outside hitter 
Sabire Karacaova‚Äôs team-high 
15 kills. Later, two consecutive Karacaova shots would extend 
the lead to 14‚Äì8, and the Tritons 
were looking at their formula 
for success. UC Davis did not 
have an answer for Karacaova, 
and Dobra dishing it out to 
Henderson or Karacaova seemed to be working off of good passes from the back line. 
UCSD continued to keep UC 
Davis at arm‚Äôs reach with Dobra 
leading the team and picking 
apart the defense. A strong kill from Henderson gave UCSD the 
third set by a score of 25‚Äì18. 
The fourth set would test 
whether the connection between 
the setters and hiters could lead 
the Tritons to an unprecedented 
comeback. It did not appear to be the case, as the Tritons again were outplayed, this time with receiving becoming an issue. The Tritons were 
fighting hard, but the game 
slowly slipped away as a tired and inexperienced Tritons team 
seemed out of options after a 
set in which they looked mostly 
unstoppable. After being down 
by seven points multiple times, a 4‚Äì0 run from UCSD again 
brought some hope, putting 
the Tritons down 16‚Äì19 with 
Dong setting up Dobra in a neat 
role reversal showing off the 
veterans‚Äô dexterity. However, 
this would be the last sign of hope for the Tritons, as they would eventually lose this set as well by a score of 18‚Äì25. 
While there were glimpses of 
hope for the Tritons, this match likely was a step back in what has been both a compelling and 
tumultuous debut season for the 
Triton‚Äôs team. Although there 
were times where the Tritons 
looked deflated, they showed effort and poise in front of a 
hostile intraconference crowd 
while not having the full roster 
at their disposal. 
The Tritons will play next on 
Tuesday, Nov. 9 at UC Irvine, 
where the Tritons will look to steal a match from a talented, 
but beatable Anteater squad that edged out UCSD in five 
sets in their earlier meeting on
