AS Week 1: Discussions 
about Election Reform
By KAITLIN LEE

/T_he /f_irst Associated Students 
Council meeting of Winter Quar -
ter centered around election re -
form, following concerns brought 
up in the previous election cycle 
in Spring 2022. Senator Eduardo 
Tapia Jr. Urbieta led the discus -
sion with a special presentation 
concerning election reform, ex -
amining ways to /f_ix current con -
stitutional election codes. 
Urbieta /f_irst went over exist -
ing election codes. /T_he codes set 
forth speci/f_ic details that help 
ensure that A.S. Council has fair 
and equitable elections, including 
“equal access to any and all with 
the inclination, quali/f_ication, and 
dedication to serve.”
However, Urbieta pointed out 
that there were issues with keep -
ing election regulations compli -
ant with these ideals. Although 
elections are supposed to be 
equally accessible to everyone, 
previous elections have not guar -
anteed this. Urbieta drew atten -
tion to four main points brought 
up during a post-election discus -
sion held during Week 6 of last 
Spring Quarter. /T_hese were issues 
with outreach and election infor -
mation accessibility, a short appli -
cation period that students were 
not informed about, restricting 
campaigning outreach, and the 
lack of support for low-income 
students wanting to run. 
Urbieta then brought up sev -
eral proposals to address the 
aforementioned issues, includ -
ing new event requirements for 
the elections manager, adopting 
direct democracy policies to em -
power students, and updating the 
endorsement process. 
/T_he new event requirements 
proposed by Urbieta will include 
two new application workshops 
during the application period. 
/T_here will also be a mandated 
candidate orientation a/f_ter the 
application process that will re -
view election rules and the re -
sponsibilities of each position be -
fore candidates run for oﬃce. 
“I think this last part is very 
important because not all can -
didates know what is involved in 
each position and what they have 
to do,” Urbieta clari/f_ied. “/T_he as -
sumption is made that the stu -
dent knows what they’re doing by 
reading the position description 
or looking at their email.” 
However, Urbieta also stated 
that these events are not required, 
and it’s up to the election man -
ager to determine whether or 
not they would like to host these LA JOLLA
La Jolla Coast Area Under Consideration for 
a Historic District Classification
By MEHRI SADRI /gid00004/gid00016/gid00015/gid00021/gid00019/gid00010/gid00003/gid00022/gid00021/gid00010/gid00015/gid00008/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
A sector of the La Jolla coastline is being con -
sidered for designation as a historic district, 
with a  /f_inal decision possibly taking place in 
the following months. 
A historic district is de/f_ined under City Municipal 
Code as a partitioned section of land distinguished 
by its unique landform or architectural appeal that 
holds great historical and cultural signi/f_icance. Some 
well-known historic districts within the county in -
clude Balboa and Old Town San Diego State Historic 
Parks. 
/T_he historic district nomination form states that 
it would encompass “public access to some of the 
most dramatic coastal scenery in California.” More 
speci/f_ically, if approved, the La Jolla historic district 
would include scenic  areas such as Shell and Boomer 
beaches, long-standing structures of cobblestone and 
beach access staircases, historically signi/f_icant sites 
such as Casa de Mañana retirement community, Red 
Roost and Red Rest cottages, as well as acres of coast -
al parkland surrounding /T_he Village.
/T_he State Historical Resources Commission may 
decide on this classi/f_ication in the following months; 
discussion of the matter is tentatively scheduled to 
occur during an April 21 board meeting. /T_he SHRC 
is a nine-member state review board appointed by 
the governor responsible for the identi/f_ication and 
preservation of California’s cultural heritage. If this 
area receives designation construction and other ac -
tivities would be limited to best protect the land. 
/T_hough set to be discussed soon, the eﬀorts to 
propose such an appellation have been years in the 
making. /T_he La Jolla Historical Society, a nonpro/f_it 
organization, arranged the nomination. More specif -
ically, a team within this committee known as the La 
Jolla Historical Society Landmark Committee — led 
by committee Chairwoman Seonaid McArthur — 
dedicated years toward granting this area a historic 
designation.To prepare the nomination, McArthur’s team 
closely studied the history and geography of the La 
Jolla area, using technology such as drones to get 
photos of the beaches and structures. 
According to McArthur, La Jolla’s development 
can be traced back to 1887 with the initial develop -
ment of La Jolla’s roads and property lots. /T_his de -
velopment period ended around 1940, when con -
struction of public facilities and architecture began 
to span farther away from the coast. Furthermore, 
McArthur also explained that the natural beauty 
of this San Diego beach “led to the construction of 
small cottages, bungalows and hotels and was the 
center of entertainment and leisure activities.” /T_he 
nomination form states that “early architecture typi -
/f_ies the beach bungalow and one of the earliest Span -
ish Revival hotels in Southern California.” Some of 
the other signi/f_icant nature incorporated in this dis -
trict includes “part of Matlahuayl State Marine Re -
serve ... Scripps Park includes heritage plantings of 
trees, shrubs and grass.”
McArthur acknowledged how, especially now, 
“people [are starting to realize] how important it 
[is] to have public space in the midst of industry so 
people [can] breathe and enjoy nature and get some 
exercise. Our town stretches the whole coastal zone 
because that is what our founders set aside for us,” 
thus leading to the speci/f_ic, beachy areas nominated 
for the district selection. 
Acknowledging the beauty of the La Jolla coast -
lines, especially as a way to get away from the turbu -
lence of everyday life, this district distinction would 
provide a clear modality to protect such valuable 
scenery.
If approved in April, the committee’s next objec -
tive will be to qualify for /T_he National Register of 
Historic Places, which is a collection of historic dis -
tricts federally recognized for their artistic and his -
torical signi/f_icance.

ers to refer to in the future. 
Urbieta also suggested remov -
ing candidate images from ballots 
because even though it allows for 
identi/f_ication, it also could al -
low uninformed voters to choose 
based on image instead of poli -
cies. 
Following this, Urbieta also 
introduced a proposal to adopt 
policies such as a recall process, 
where students could vote to re -
move an oﬃcer from A.S. Coun -
cil. As of now, UC San Diego is 
the only University of California 
campus that does not have a re -
call process for its student gov -
ernment. 
“We are the only campus not 
to provide students the direct op -
portunity to hold their elected 
constituents accountable,” Ur -
bieta noted. 
Urbieta also stated that the current election code does not 
allow A.S. Council members use 
their titles for election activities 
and that there is no way of man -
aging endorsements. To address 
these issues, Urbieta proposed 
creating a new process for en -
dorsements from student orga -
nizations and individuals and al -
lowing A.S. Council members to 
use their titles for identi/f_ication 
purposes. 
/T_he rest of the meeting was 
mostly spent on discussing elec -
tion reform. It also included dis -
cussions of new /f_inancial alloca -
tions to student organizations, 
including a Lunar New Year So -
cial and PiB Project Committee. 
A.S. Council meetings take 
place at 6 p.m. every Wednesday 
and are open to students. Students 
can participate in these meetings

California has earned its 
reputation as the le/f_t-wing bastion 
of America. Having voted for the 
Democratic nominee in every 
presidential election since 1992, 
the California Democratic Party 
now holds the governorship and 
supermajorities in both chambers 
of the state legislature. Such 
control would make one assume 
that California is a liberal haven, 
the product of what unilateral 
Democratic control looks like. 
And while California does have 
many of these policies — be it 
higher taxes, higher-paid teachers, 
or relaxed drug enforcement, it 
also has many issues. Some are 
common in high-population 
states, but some are unique to 
California and pose complex 
questions about the true motives 
of its supposedly liberal residents. Public transit in California is 
of special concern. San Diego’s 
MTS and the Bay Area’s BART are 
used by many, but compared to 
most east coast cities the lack of 
public transportation — especially 
extending into suburban areas — 
is shocking. Metro systems on 
the west coast are expanding, 
but their breadth and usage still 
falls short of many of their east 
coast counterparts. Perhaps the 
biggest tragedy is the lack of a 
direct connection between Los 
Angeles and San Francisco by 
train. /T_he proposed high speed 
rail has fallen /f_lat due to staunch 
opposition from Republicans and 
some Democrats, a disappointing 
outcome that keeps cars on the 
road. But aside from government 
ineﬃciency, it is the fact that a 
sizable number of people in the 
state are staunchly opposed to 
public transit on principle that 
has stymied the project. Take 
some of the students here at UC San Diego, a rather liberal school, 
which makes it a likely venue for 
strong support of the new trolley 
system running through the La 
Jolla area. 
While it is true that public 
transit can lead to crime (especially 
since the COVID-19 pandemic), 
excessive fear mongering (which 
is being seen at UCSD) can reduce 
ridership and make it even more 
unsafe for those who need to take 
it regardless, such as students 
without cars living oﬀ campus. 
MTS has also responded by 
increasing police patrols on the 
service, and crime has fallen since. 
/T_he trolley and bus systems run by 
San Diego MTS reduce emissions 
and are a real, tangible way for 
students to contribute to /f_ighting 
the climate crisis, the supposed 
top concern of people our age. 
Fighting climate change requires 
some sacri/f_ice, and eschewing cars 
and riding public transit is a step 
in the right direction, especially if it can convince others to do 
so to alleviate safety concerns. 
/T_his comes with the bene/f_it of 
aﬀordability — public transit costs 
signi/f_icantly less than owning 
and servicing a car. On a student 
budget, every such penny counts. 
Much of this has to do with a 
“not in my backyard, ” or NIMBY 
problem that seems to plague 
many progressives in America, 
but is particularly noticeable 
in California. Renting in San 
Francisco is 94% more expensive 
than the rest of the country, and 
building more aﬀordable housing 
is a clear solution to at least part 
of that problem. But the attitudes 
of San Francisco residents prevent 
this. A study found that “even 
in highly diverse communities, 
development meetings are 
dominated by whites who oppose 
new housing. ” Residents shot 
down projects for claims such 
as that converting a parking lot 
into a building would “increase traﬃc. ” Really, this is all a thinly 
veiled attempt to prevent the 
“wrong people” from moving into 
more expensive San Francisco 
neighborhoods and “bring down 
property values. ” 
NIMBY attitudes are not 
unique to California, but 
are especially disappointing 
considering the strong activist 
nature of the state. But these beliefs 
have led to the rise of so called 
YIMBYs (“yes in my backyard”). 
Such activists are attending 
community meetings, running 
for local oﬃce, and pushing for 
change to make the golden state 
more aﬀordable and welcome for 
all. If more can follow their lead, 
then this goal will be well within 
reach. Californians must put 
aside personal biases and look at 
the bigger picture — more transit 
and more housing will lower the 
overall cost of living and make all 
lives in this state better.

The Circus is Over, It’s Time to Govern
By Sparky Mitra
/gid00016/gid00017/gid00010/gid00015/gid00010/gid00016/gid00015/gid00001/gid00006/gid00005/gid00010/gid00021/gid00016/gid00019
Following the chaotic 
speakership nomination and 
election of Representative Kevin 
McCarthy, many liberals threw 
their hands up as the world feasted 
its eyes with relentless C-SPAN 
coverage of dysfunctional 
Republican majority in the U.S. 
House of Representatives. While 
some of this unwillingness to 
collaborate was necessary during 
the nomination process for 
Democrats to hold their ground, 
that is where the dysfunction 
should have stopped.
Instead, what we saw was 
an onslaught of legislation from 
Republicans that faced zero 
scrutiny and vocal opposition 
beyond the chambers where the 
Rules Package was put up for a 
vote. Among other conservative 
policies, the rules package 
contains elements essentially 
barring congressional staﬀers 
from unionizing. While it is 
unlikely that Democrats would 
be able to stop this rules package 
from passing with them being 
the minority, they could have 
endeavored to connect other 
Republican constituents to what 
their congressmen were passing 
legislation on. 
With union busting on the 
docket of the Republicans’ /f_irst 
piece of legislation in the House, 
this could be a perfect opportunity 
for Democrats to go to midwestern 
towns where unions tend to 
endorse Republican candidates 
and show them how anti-working 
class their representatives 
really are. Instead, I see many 
Democrats, especially moderates 
relying on dysfunction to carry them through the next election. 
Instead of getting work done, they 
are simply pointing /f_ingers at the 
misdoings of conservatives. 
/T_hough this may be due to a 
general dislike for Republicans, 
another possible reason for this 
focus on dysfunction over progress 
and legislative accountability 
is the Democrats only lacking 
accomplishments especially 
when focusing on supporting 
unionized workers. Democrats, 
especially moderates, buckled 
under the pressure from the Biden 
administration when it came to 
dealing with railroad workers and imposing a poorly negotiated 
contract on them. Because of laws 
that speci/f_ically target railroad 
workers, and the economic impact 
that their striking would have, 
Congress was endowed with an 
authority that the Democratic-
held majority abused to silence 
workers. /T_his step among others 
alienated the very working-class 
voters that Democrats claim to 
support. Striking has economic 
implications, which is o/f_ten why 
it works and Congress using that 
and some antiquated rules to 
bypass negotiations with labor 
unions is a low blow for working class constituents.
While Republicans like to hone 
in on the economy as a point of 
constant criticism of progressive 
ideals, it is important to note 
that Democrats succumb to this 
constant /f_ire that conservatives 
subject them to. With this hyper-
/f_ixated outlook on economic 
implications, without considering 
the people who make the economy 
Republicans have long abandoned 
considering people before 
pro/f_its. But when neoliberals get 
frightened of this criticism, they 
also abandon the people they 
claim to support./T_he economy is dictated by the 
success and failures of Americans. 
Of people. So it is the people 
whose success we should invest in. 
Striking laborers what, of course, 
put some stresses on the economy, 
but at the end of it, they would 
likely have greater purchasing 
power to then stimulate that very 
economy that was put under 
some temporary stress. /T_his isn’t 
the /f_irst time that liberals have 
been scared of the economy, 
temporarily diminishing their 
positioning among people. When 
the coronavirus caused economic 
strife due to protective shutdowns, 
neoliberals eventually ushered 
in and embraced a new level of 
negligence towards the virus’ 
eﬀect on again, the people, that led 
to premature opening. /T_his was 
not the opinion of some but many 
including the Director of the 
National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases that they had 
once championed, Dr. Anthony 
Fauci.
While lukewarm progressives 
are not blatantly classist, they 
must remain the party of bold 
action for the people. Pointing out 
dysfunction in the opposition is 
important for elections. Not for 
governing. It’s not election season 
right now, it’s time to govern. 
Conservatives may block class 
and people-centered legislation, 
but liberals should at least focus 
on championing that legislation 
on and oﬀ /T_he Hill, while reaching 
out, for example, to unionized 
constituents of both parties. 
Action for the people depends 
on Democrats taking progressive 
steps towards change. It’s time 
to step up and be more than the 
party of no harm. It’s time to be 
the party of good.

On Nov. 14, almost 48,000 
academic workers across all nine 
campuses initiated the largest 
strike at an academic institution in 
history. 
Academic workers (UAW 2865) 
and student researchers (SRU-
UAW) were striking for a contract 
that included needs such as higher 
wages, job security, anti-bullying 
protections, dependent healthcare 
coverage, and other union rights. 
Postdoctoral academic researchers 
(UAW 5810) were striking for 
compensation to leverage and 
address needs including the 
increased cost of living, work 
environment protections, and 
disability accommodations, and 
more. 
On Dec. 18, a tentative contract 
agreement between the UC and 
the union, with 62% of UAW 
2865 members, 68% of SRU-UAW 
members, and 89.4% of UAW 5810 
members voted yes to ratify the 
negotiation contract. 
Although initially excited 
with the major wins from the new 
contracts, some union members 
weren’t completely satis/f_ied with 
how the strike was conducted and 
felt that more could have been 
earned in the tentative contracts. 
In an interview with Jake 
Orbison, a member of UAW 2865 
at UC Berkeley, the rank-and-/f_ile 
strategy was described as the focus 
theory, which some dissatis/f_ied members were advocating for. 
A strategy that prioritizes a 
powerful membership body 
rather than a leadership council. 
“It’s not about taking over 
power [rather it’s] making 
sure that the union performs 
democratically and /f_ights for 
what the membership needs,” 
Orbison said.
In the context of the strike, 
the rank-and-/f_ile strategic 
theory highlights the structural 
constraints on unions that 
withhold the possible role which 
union leaders could serve in 
constructing a strong /f_ighting 
capacity among membership. 
Orbison emphasized this 
theory as he explained UC 
Berkeley’s union leaders’ 
failure to create a proper 
/f_low of communication from 
membership to leadership. 
According to him, union leaders 
at Berkeley didn’t reach out to 
its members to address concerns 
over withholding labor and 
possibilities of improving the 
strike. 
Like Orbison, many members 
who are sympathetic to the rank-
and-/f_ile strategy view leadership 
and paid staﬀ as facilitators of 
the members’ wills. Paid staﬀers 
at the union are separate from 
union members, as they are paid 
two to three times more and are 
a part of a separate union. 
“Our contract is our contract. 
We are the highest authority [to 
judge] what it should look like 
and how we should /f_ight for it”, Orbison said. 
Concerns are also brewing 
among union members for what’s 
in store for academic workers 
post-strike. 
/T_hese concerns have already 
been present among members, 
but they’ve become more intense 
a/f_ter the strike, as described by 
graduate researcher and lead 
TA organizer in his department, 
Zach Goldberg. 
“/T_he university /f_inds new 
and creative ways all the time to 
violate almost every article of the 
contract in one way or another,” 
Goldberg said. 
Goldberg added that some 
graduate students went three to 
seven weeks without a paycheck 
because of an error made by the 
university through UCPath. 
According to Goldberg, 
missing or incorrect paychecks 
is a common error with the UC 
payroll system. With the new 
contract, graduate students 
are now able to /f_ile grievances, 
which place legal pressure on the 
university to pay their employees 
on time and correctly. 
Goldberg also described 
instances of verbal abuse within 
most departments both before 
and during the strike. 
“O/f_ten, there are advisors 
and PIs that are just straight 
up abusive and are bullies and 
don’t treat their graduate student 
workers with respect or dignity,” 
Goldberg said. “We deal with that 
all the time.” 
Goldberg detailed past incidents of harassment in the 
academic workspace, from a 
student being told they were 
“worthless” to a student being 
threatened that their hair would 
be cut oﬀ if they failed to come up 
with “brilliant ideas.”
Further, he expressed his 
concerns over this treatment 
continuing, evident by the 
responses of certain professors 
and administration when the 
strike began. According to 
Goldberg, PIs and instructors 
were telling their students that 
they risked the loss of their 
academic standing or graduation 
date if they chose to strike. 
“We have countless examples 
of worker intimidation. All of 
these things are completely illegal 
under the state labor law. And yet, 
it happened over and over and 
over in every department at every 
campus throughout this strike,” 
he said. 
Union member Ximena 
Garcia-Arceo described a similar 
rhetoric. 
According to Garcia-Arceo, 
emails with false information 
were sent out by UC San Diego 
administrators, such as from 
the Executive Vice Chancellor 
Elizabeth Simmons, to students 
throughout the strike, such as the 
claim that international students’ 
visas would be jeopardized if they 
chose to participate in the strike.
Garcia-Arceo broke down how 
nonfactual rhetoric said from the 
top of administration can bleed 
down to the bottom. Victory, but the Fight Prolongs

“I’m sure that [the chairs 
of departments] are not fully 
convinced because they are 
hearing things to the contrary 
of what the contract or table talk 
says from folks who are very high 
up in administrative positions,” 
Garcia-Arceo said.
Garcia-Arceo also described 
how her coworkers have received 
or heard talk about program 
chairmen not being “fully 
convinced” of the new contract. 
/T_he spread of emails 
containing misleading or false 
information about the strike was 
a “classic union-busting” tactic, 
as Goldberg described it. 
He referred to UCSD 
attempting to portray the union 
as a third party when the majority 
of the union are workers at the 
universities themselves.  
/T_he doubt that the higher 
administration is placing in 
the minds of TAs, students, 
and academic researchers is 
yet to hinder hope among UC 
academics, as Garcia-Arceo 
describes it. 
With the next contract 
negotiation scheduled for 2025, 
UC academics are indulging 
in the winnings of now but are 
preparing for the future to come. 
“/T_he key in going forward 
[is to] mend bridges with folks 
who were unsatis/f_ied. /T_he most 
important thing is unity and 
strength within the union. Now, 
we’re going to have to get this 
contract enforced together”, 
Garcia-Arceo said.

While my TikTok For Y ou page 
is absolutely nowhere near normal 
— at least with reruns of “Family 
Guy, ” Topher memes, and that one 
guy who thinks he’s the de/f_inition 
of the feminine gaze — the one 
thing I can count on is “Bluey. ” 
Over break, I was exposed to 
mass amounts of the lovable Blue 
Heeler and her family, and it’s safe 
to say that Bluey and her adven -
tures have completely taken over 
my life. Bluey, for those who don’t 
know, is an Australian kid’s show 
available on Disney+ that has re -
cently blown up all over social me -
dia. Alongside six-year-old Bluey 
is her younger sister Bingo, her 
dad Bandit, and her mother Chilli. 
/T_he show also features Bluey and 
Bingo’s friends and family who 
are all diﬀerent breeds of dogs. 
Altogether, Bluey focuses on the 
power of imagination and playing 
games while also highlighting the 
strength of good parenting. 
And yes, I will be the /f_irst to 
admit that it is incredibly embar -
rassing to be watching a children’s 
show at 18 years old, but once you 
watch your /f_irst episode of Bluey, 
you’ll understand. Be warned: 
massive spoilers are ahead.  My 
personal favorite episode (once, 
I completed the show in a mere 
three days), is Episode 43 of Sea -
son 1, “Camping, ” in which the 
Heelers go on a family camp -
ing trip, and Bluey meets a new 
friend. /T_he plot twist is that this 
friend doesn’t speak any English.
While many of us have been ex -
posed to international students or 
other people whose /f_irst language 
isn’t English, putting a six year old 
who can barely even read or write 
their own language in front of an -
other six year old who only knows 
French is unprecedented in chil -
dren’s shows. Within the episode, 
Bluey learns to overcome the lan -
guage barrier with her new friend, 
Jean Luc, through other forms of 
communication. A/f_ter devising 
a master plan through pictures 
with mud on a rock, the pair /f_ight a wild pig and create memories 
within the nearby forest. But as 
with all good things, their time to -
gether must come to an end, and 
Jean Luc must go back to France. 
While Bluey doesn’t fully under -
stand the concept of people in her 
life suddenly entering and leaving, 
her mother explains it best — all 
the while her sister Bingo is “hav -
ing a bush wee. ”
Bluey: Why did Jean Luc have 
to go?
Chilli:  /T_heir holiday was over, 
honey.
Bluey: But I want to keep play -
ing with him! He was my friend!
Chilli: Well, look, sometimes 
special people come into our lives, stay for a bit, and then they have 
to go.
Bluey:  But that’s sad!
Chilli:  It is, but the part where 
they were here was happy, wasn’t 
it?
Bluey:  Y eah, we caught a wild 
pig together!
Chilli: Maybe that makes it all 
worth it.
Are you done wiping the 
stream of tears oﬀ your face? Y es? 
Good.
Of course, watching the actual 
episode makes Chilli’s words hit a 
little more, but even in that 15-sec -
ond exchange between a Red Heel -
er and her daughter, it is evident 
that the power of Bluey extends 
beyond any age range. As such, the concepts found in other Bluey 
episodes are similar to “Camping” 
— learning perseverance, how to 
resolve con/f_lict through commu -
nication, how to be patient, and 
overall, how to simply grow up. In 
“Camping, ” Bluey learns that some 
people just aren’t meant to stay in 
her life forever, but she shouldn’t 
be sad about it and should instead 
cherish those memories until they 
meet again. I’m not sure about you 
guys, but when I was six years old, 
I had no concept of the divergence 
of people in my life, and especially 
no concept of holding onto my 
memories instead of being sad I’m 
not creating new ones. 
It’s safe to say that Bluey has 
suﬃciently taken over my life 
— in both good and bad ways. 
While it’s ironic that the Heeler family promotes playing games 
rather than watching TV or being 
on a tablet, the lessons they teach 
through their show are unlike any 
other kid’s show on Disney+. Each 
episode has me tearing up, and, 
not to make my parents feel bad, 
but it feels as though I’m reteach -
ing myself lessons about friend -
ship and family all over again. 
So I implore you to watch Blu -
ey, not only for the surprisingly 
wholesome and endearing life les -
sons in each episode but also for 
the cute little Australian accents 
featured in every episode. While it 
may not teach you anything new, 
it could give you a new perspec -
tive on things you once thought 
you understood. Just be prepared 
and bring a box of tissues with you 
when you do.

The Animals of 
UC San Diego
On a mission to capture animal life sprawling around campus, four UC San Diego 
students ventured out to document what they saw. From Birch Aquarium to the Warren 
Residential Life Oﬃce and everything in between, these animals showcase the diversity 
and vitality of the campus life. Although UCSD is known for its “trash pandas,” a.k.a. 
raccoons, there is much more to discover — including Queen Angel/f_ish, snails, dogs, 
rabbits, and birds. 
Here’s a small reminder that nature is all around us and to be respectful to the ani -
mals that cohabitate this space. Be kind to our little friends and celebrate their existence 
and beauty, both on and oﬀ campus. 
Next time you’re walking around campus, heading to your next class or just going 
with friends to grab a quick bite at Price Center, keep an eye out for some of these ani -
mals and enjoy the slay nature that surrounds us.ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT/C.cap/O.cap/N.cap/T.cap/A.cap/C.cap/T.cap /T.cap/H.cap/E.cap /E.cap/D.cap/I.cap/T.cap/O.cap/R.cap

HECTOR ARRIETA
In Greek mythology, Zeus 
split humans in two, fearing our 
potential power, and condemning 
us to an eternal search for a per -
fect half. From this myth arose 
the romanticism of soulmates. 
While many have taken the ri -
gidity of this de/f_inition to heart, 
I have found solace in accepting 
that I may have more than one 
soulmate; in the idea that, for 
each stage of life, there could be 
someone with whom I inexplica -
bly connect, whether platonically 
or romantically. 
My thoughts about soulmates 
are rooted in the knowledge that 
people are constantly changing 
and re/f_ining their beliefs which 
can aﬀect the nature of their 
personal relationships. Implicit 
in the acceptance of continual 
growth is the understanding 
that, for the most part, I will only 
know the people in my life within 
a particular context that is /f_iltered 
through my own perception. For 
many of my best friends now, I 
came into their lives a/f_ter years of 
experiences that I will never fully 
know about; and, I understand 
that they continue to hold and build relationships that I am not 
privy to. 
/T_his thought has never both -
ered me. In fact, I have always 
appreciated a certain degree of 
separation from many of my 
friends. But, as I read Hua Hsu’s 
recount of his friendship with his 
best friend Ken and the grieving 
process just a few years a/f_ter their 
meeting, I was thrust into a state 
of insecurity that le/f_t me feeling 
groundless. 
“Stay True” is Hsu’s debut 
memoir that made its way into 
the New York Times 2022 top 10 
book list. In less than 200 pages, 
Hsu delves back into the mind 
of his college self — a self-pro -
claimed alternative thinker who 
constantly pushes the boundaries 
of contrarianism — his friend -
ship with Ken, music, and Berke -
ley’s local history that accented 
Hsu’s adolescence. Even with an 
expansive range of topics dis -
cussed, what held my attention 
was the delicacy with which Hsu 
describes the small moments that 
formed his friendships. 
Ken is seemingly the antithesis 
of Hsu: a fraternity brother from 
a well-adjusted Asian American

ing Ken as seriously as he does 
himself. But, through a series of 
small rituals and unspoken un -
derstandings, the two become 
close. /T_hroughout the memoir, 
Hsu never explicitly explains the 
nature of their friendship, or the 
shi/f_t from friends to best friends, 
as though their connection was as 
inarticulable as that of soulmates. 
Instead, he focuses on their ritu -
als: smoking cigarettes on the 
balcony, studying together at the 
same table in the library, making 
fun of users in right-wing chat 
rooms, curating mix tapes for 
late-night drives, and discussing 
old movies. 
A/f_ter three years of friend -
ship, it seemed as though Hsu 
knew just about everything about 
Ken, especially as they saw each 
other mature into adulthood. 
/T_heir bond felt like everything; 
or at least, it felt like enough. But, 
during Ken’s funeral, surrounded 
by strangers who held diﬀerent 
connections to him, Hsu felt the 
scope of his knowledge shrink. 
While describing the funeral ser -
vice, Hsu writes: “/T_hey referred 
to him as ‘Kenneth’ and quoted 
friends I didn’t know. I knew him 
in such a speci/f_ic way, and it be -
gan to feel too small.” Quite frankly, this line made 
me spiral. I thought about the lit -
tle rituals I have with my friends 
and for the /f_irst time, wondered if 
it was enough. I felt a sel/f_ish and 
possessive need to know them 
more — to know them best. Even 
with my closest friend now, some -
one to whom I feel an unexplain -
able draw and with whom I spend 
most of my hours, I began to won -
der how much I might be missing 
from her past and her future. 
Like Ken and Hsu, we met 
in freshman year of college and 
connected relatively super/f_icially 
over music and a shared Asian 
heritage. I cannot quite track how 
or when, but eventually spend -
ing time with her became part of 
my daily routine. I have always 
known that our time together is 
limited by school — even more so 
since she hopes to graduate one 
year early. But suddenly, this fact 
mattered over everything else. 
More than the excitement of her 
plans, or the pride in her contin -
ual success, or how just one year 
of friendship has felt like decades 
— only that with her growth, the 
speci/f_ic way in which I know her 
could start to feel too small. I had 
confronted a hole in my beliefs 
of the transience of soulmates: I wished to keep my relationship 
with my soulmate the same for -
ever.    
But, I know this is impos -
sible, and in truth, I would not 
want such stagnancy in life for 
either of us, especially during 
adolescence. So, I return to what 
I know now: watching rom-coms 
that make us sob, examining each 
other’s shelves for books to bor -
row, laughing at how long it takes 
her to /f_ind me in a crowd, a kiss 
on the cheek before we part. I re -
mind myself of how she makes me 
better. Like Ken to Hsu, my clos -
est friends have shown me who I 
want to be, have indulged me in 
my obsessions, and taught me to 
appreciate things I used to over -
look. 
Between the details of college 
life, Hsu makes conclusions about 
friendship that he has learned 
from time spent with Ken. One 
re/f_lection stuck with me the most: 
“friendship is about the willing -
ness to know, rather than to be 
known.” I know that in a year, 
maybe even less, my friendships 
will change. With the time I have 
with those around me, all I can 
do is learn as much as I can from 
them, carry it with me, and that 
will be enough. BY Xuan Ly

Historians of the Holocaust tend to reject

scholars of fascism present the Shoah as

Heartbreak for Tritons at UC Riverside Rally to Win
Six Biggest Surprises of  the NBA Season So FarUC San Diego Men’s Basketball 
(6–10, 1–3 Big West) squandered 
what was at one point an 18-point 
lead at the LionTree Arena against 
the UC Riverside Highlanders 
(11–6, 4–1 Big West). For the Tri -
tons, sophomore forward Francis 
Nwaokorie scored a season-high 
20 points, along with 8 rebounds. 
Despite some big performances, 
the Tritons once again struggled 
to close out a Big West matchup.
In a high-scoring /f_irst few 
minutes of play, the Tritons moved 
the ball around and enjoyed a bal -
anced oﬀense. But UC Riverside’s 
explosive shooting helped the 
Highlanders to a 14–10 open -
ing run. A/f_ter that, the furious 
exchange of scoring continued 
with redshirt junior Emmanuel 
Tshimanga drawing a foul for the 
Tritons on a successful layup to 
punctuate the hot oﬀense with 
the and-one play. Redshirt junior 
guard Bryce Pope converted the 
free throw to give UCSD their 
/f_irst lead of the game at 19–18. A 
9–2 run to close out the half then 
helped the Tritons gain a 13-point 
lead to go into the half with a 
40–27 scoreline, with the Tritons’ 
balanced scoring eﬀort leading the 
way.
/T_he Triton lead kept on grow -
ing as the second half commenced, 
with redshirt junior guard Jace 
Roquemore hitting a big dunk 
on a steal from freshman guard BY ISHIR TALAPATRA
/gid00004/gid00016/gid00015/gid00021/gid00019/gid00010/gid00003/gid00022/gid00021/gid00010/gid00015/gid00008/gid00001/gid00020/gid00017/gid00016/gid00019/gid00021/gid00020/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019Roddie Anderson III. Nwaokorie 
in particular was dominant, get -
ting rebounds on both sides of 
the court and muscling his way 
into the paint. /T_he team seemed 
to build on his energy and, 11 
minutes into the second half, 
the Triton lead had swelled to 18 
points, the highest of the night. A 
7–2 Highlanders run helped cut 
the lead to 11 going into the next 
timeout, but the Tritons still ap -
peared to be too much to handle 
for Riverside. 
UC Riverside Coach Mike 
Magpayo certainly said something 
to his players, who came out and 
cut the margin to just two points. 
All of a sudden, the Highlanders 
were on /f_ire a/f_ter losing their hot 
shooting streak in the early part of 
the /f_irst half. /T_he Tritons’ defense 
was nowhere to be found as the 
lead was cut to two. Shortly there -
a/f_ter, the Highlanders recaptured 
the lead to go up three points with 
20 seconds remaining. /T_he 28–6 
crushing run put a huge damper 
on the Tritons’ hopes to take a Big 
West game, but it was not over yet.
An important drive to the bas -
ket from Pope gave the Tritons 
some hope, but the seven seconds 
le/f_t in the game meant the Tritons 
had to intentionally foul, and the 
Highlanders did not surrender 
their momentum by hitting both 
free throws. /T_he Tritons called 
timeout but failed to capitalize, 
and a three-point shot from the 
Highlanders was good to give 
them a 6-point win, to the disap -
pointment of the packed student section at the LionTree Arena. 
/T_he Tritons were le/f_t to rue 
their second-half performance, 
where they shot 32.1% from the 
/f_ield and 20% from outside the 
arc, as opposed to 55.2% and 30%, 
respectively, in the /f_irst half. /T_he 
Tritons also committed 16 turn -
overs to the Highlanders’ 7 and 
converted just four second-chance 
points to Riverside’s 20. Despite 
spending 28 minutes of the game 
in front, a lack of eﬃciency in 
the second half cost the Tritons a 
much-needed win to bounce back 
a/f_ter last week’s loss to University 
of Hawaii. 
Triton Coach Eric Olen was 
contemplative a/f_terward. 
“When you have situations like 
that where you let games get away, 
it’s usually not just one thing” , 
Olen said a/f_ter the game. Regard -
ing whether this loss hurt more 
than others, he said that “at the 
end of the day, they all count the 
same. ” 
One positive note, however, 
was the loud support for UCSD, 
something certainly noticed by 
Olen. 
“/T_hat’s been awesome, all 
year, ” Olen said, adding that “our 
guys feel that. ” 
/T_he Tritons will certainly hope 
for such support when, a/f_ter an 
away game at CSU Bakers/f_ield on 
Saturday, the team returns to the 
LionTree Arena on Martin Luther 
King Jr. Day to face UC Davis at 3 
p.m. for more Big West action.

/T_here have been numerous big 
surprises in the NBA season so far, 
with many teams underperform -
ing expectations and others sur -
passing expectations. /T_here are six 
that stand out and will be worth 
keeping tabs on as the season pro -
gresses. 
1. /T_he Struggling Warriors: 
/T_he Golden State Warriors have 
been one of the biggest surprises 
so far this season, but not in a 
good way. Currently the team sits 
at a 21–21 record, a far cry from 
where they were expected to be 
this year. /T_he Warriors’ problems 
stem from two main issues: their 
inability to win on the road and 
their lack of depth. /T_he Warriors 
currently have a 17–5 record when 
playing at home, but their road 
record is 4–16, making them one 
of the worst teams in the NBA on 
the road. /T_heir other problem is a 
result of the youth and oﬀseason 
signings not performing to the 
team’s expectations. Players like 
James Wiseman and Jamychal 
Green were expected to have big 
roles oﬀ the bench, but instead 
both of these players play very few 
minutes or do not play at all. /T_he 
Warriors have big issues, but there 
is still hope that the team can re -
turn to the championship con -
tender they were expected to be.
2. Lauri Markenen and the 
Utah Jazz: /T_hrough the early part 
of the season, the Utah Jazz were 
the number one seed in the west 
and Lauri Markenen was playing 
like a superstar. /T_he team was ex -
pected to be one of the worst in 
basketball, but have decided to 
surprise most of the NBA media. 
A player who has /f_lourished in this 
team has been Lauri Markenen, 
averaging 24.5 ppg while convert -
ing 40% from three. He’s been good enough to be an all-star this 
season, which is something no -
body expected from the former 
seventh overall pick. Although the 
Jazz have come down to Earth in 
recent weeks, their start was some -
thing that surprised everyone and 
has put them in a prime spot to 
potentially make the playoﬀs. 
3. /T_he Rise of the Kings: /T_his 
past oﬀseason, the Sacramento 
Kings decided to /f_ire their coach 
and hire Mike Brown, a former as -
sistant coach of the Golden State 
Warriors. /T_his move has worked 
wonders for the franchise as for 
the /f_irst time in countless years, 
they have a chance at making the 
playoﬀs. Currently the Kings sit at 
the /f_i/f_th seed in the western con -
ference standings at a 22–18 re -
cord. /T_heir star players, De’ Aaron 
Fox and Domantas Sabonis, have 
played their best basketball this 
year under the tutelage of Brown. /T_he team has gone from one of the 
worst- coached basketball teams 
to one of the best, with their of -
fense ranking top three in bas -
ketball at a 116.3 oﬀensive rating. 
It’s surprising that the Kings, who 
were dreadful the year before, have 
improved this much this quickly. 
4. /T_he Failure of the Phoe -
nix Suns: /T_he Phoenix Suns were 
touted as championship favorites 
last season as they won 64 games, 
but were ultimately disappointed 
as they lost to the Dallas Maver -
icks in the second round. Going 
into this season this team was 
expected to still be a top three 
seed in the west, but things have 
not gone to plan. With injuries 
to Devin Booker, Chris Paul, and 
Deandre Ayton at diﬀerent points 
this season, the team has already 
lost more games than they had 
all of last season. Role player Jae 
Crowder has been absent from the team due to a contract dispute, 
culminating in the Suns having a 
steep decline in talent on the /f_loor. 
/T_hey currently sit as the 10th seed 
with a 21–23 record. With the 
right injury luck, this team could 
make a comeback on the year, but 
as we currently sit, the Phoenix 
Suns have failed to build a cham -
pionship team. 
5. /T_he Ascension of Tyrese 
Haliburton: Tyrese Haliburton 
was traded to the Pacers last sea -
son at the trade deadline. /T_he 
Pacers decided to trade their star 
player away for this young player 
with a seemingly unlimited poten -
tial, and it’s starting to work out. 
/T_his season, Haliburton is aver -
aging 20 ppg and an astounding 
10 apg, which are career highs in 
both categories. He has taken on 
the star role for the Pacers and is 
doing better than most people 
expected, as he has led them to a 23–20 record. Haliburton is set to 
make his /f_irst all-star appearance 
this season and possibly become 
a /f_inalist for the Most Improved 
Player award.
6. /T_he Disappointing Toron -
to Raptors : /T_he Toronto Raptors 
were one of the most promising 
teams going into this season, with 
players like Pascal Siakam, Fred 
Vanvleet, and Scottie Barnes. So 
far this season they have yet to 
live up to that potential. /T_he team 
currently sits at a 19–-23 record, 
with a 5–-13 record on the road. 
/T_his team, despite the champion -
ship pedigree they have, has been 
unable to /f_igure it out so far. With 
this disappointing record half -
way through the season, the team 
could become a seller in the trade 
market and commit to a full re -
build, rather than continuing on 
with this roster. /T_he Raptors are 
on the clock of whether or not 
they can live up to the expecta -
tions set upon them.
