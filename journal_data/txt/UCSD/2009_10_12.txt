UCDC, a popular program that sends 
UC students to intern in Washington D.C. 
while earning academic credit, is facing budget cuts that could dramatically reduce the program’s size and scope.
The UCDC Academic Advising 
Committee met Sept. 23 to discuss the a reduced budget proposal. The committe will meet  again next month to continue discus-
sions.
“We’re looking at ways to streamline the 
administrative structure  and to take advan-
tage of curricular overlap among campuses, ” Associate Vice Chancellor for Undergraduate 
Education Barbara Sawrey said.The program allows juniors and seniors 
from the nine undergraduate UC cam-
puses, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Michigan to study in Washington D.C. for a quarter while work-ing 32 hours a week at an internship and taking upper-division classes.
Currently, each campus has its own 
branch for recruiting students and professors to participate in the UCDC program. The proposal under consideration by the commit-tee would consolidate the branches into one larger entity in order to cut operating costs.
“The UC Washington Center is a place 
where all the campuses come with their students, and that’s why each campus has it’s own director, ” UCSD Washington Program Director Samuel Kernell Kernell said. “The new plan calls for a much bigger main cen-ter, as it takes over things that are presently covered by the campuses. ”
The plan would also make cuts to cur-
riculum and residential programs. Kernell 
said that if all the branches are consolidated, fewer total courses would 
be offered. The reduction would especially limit the number of courses spe-cifically geared toward UCSD students.

Though budget constraints led university offi-
cials to slash all funding for the senior-seminar 
program earlier this year, four faculty members have continued to offer seminars this quarter — on their own time, and without compensation.
Participation in the program has fallen dramati-
cally since Spring Quarter, when 27 faculty members offered senior seminars with the promise of a $1,500 
stipend.
Sociology professor Mary Blair-
Loy, mechanical and aerospace engineering professor Carl Gibson, chemistry professor Judy Kim and bioengineering professor Robert Sah are the only remaining instruc-tors who chose to lead a seminar this quarter. 
A letter sent by Associate Vice Chancellor for 
Undergraduate Education Barbara Sawrey to the Academic Senate faculty members in March 2009 stated that stipends would not be provided for professors who offered the seminars, though they were encouraged to participate on a voluntary basis.
First introduced Fall Quarter 2006, the senior-
seminar program was created to facilitate closer 
interaction between faculty and students through 
smaller, less demanding courses. 
“I definitely feel like I’m missing out by not talking 
to the professors, because the job of the TAs is to kind Professors no longer receive
stipends for teaching senior seminars. Freshman equivalent could see similar cuts next year.-(33-,:; 

of reiterate what the professor’s saying 
— kind of clear things up, ” Thurgood Marshall College senior Tamer Abu-Dayyeh said. “The benefit is to talk straight to the professors, because he or she has the best interpretation of what they’re trying to say. ” 
Abu-Dayyeh said that allowing for 
more intimate interaction between student and faculty allows professors to write more informed letters of rec-ommendation.
“Y ou’ve definitely got to get closer 
to your professors — talk to them, become buddies with them — so that it’s not weird when you’re asking for a letter of recommendation or a refer-ence from them, ” Abu-Dayyeh said. “Lots of times, professors just have a generic letter of recommendation where they just fill in the blanks with your name or your information, but the best ones come from the professors that actually know you — that have worked with you on a deeper level. ”
Funding for freshman seminars 
is still available for this current aca-demic year, but the near future of its funding remains uncertain. 
“It’s pretty generous, the profes-
sors who do this, ” professor Lisa Tauxe, who teaches a freshman semi-nar, said. “They get a little bit of research money … per seminar, if they have enough students. So it’s an incentive to teach these classes, and without it I don’t know how many will continue to do it. ”
This quarter, 64 freshman semi-
nars are in session.

“My concern with the changes 
that are being proposed is that they aren’t as attentive to the needs of UCSD students who need to come here and satisfy upper-division requirements to graduate, ” Kernell said. “If we change the academic offerings in the ways that are pro-posed, it may not be as compatible for juniors and seniors who need to graduate on time. ”
Students participating in the 
program currently pay approxi-mately the same quarterly fee in Washington, D.C. as they would at their home campuses. Though the student fees cover lodging expenses, the UC Office of the President pays for the program’s operational costs and administrative salaries.
The committee is looking for ways 
to lift these expenses from the uni-versity—such as rerouting student fees or terminating administrative positions.
“If they fail to receive student fees, 
the center would shrink in terms of its budget dramatically, ” Kernell said. “It would no longer provide the type of services students now enjoy, which include outings and speakers. We recently set up student counsel-ing services. For the first six years, there was nowhere students could turn. Now we have people who stu-dents can turn to, and students have taken advantage of that, and that costs money. ”
The committee plans to have its 
proposed cutbacks ready for review by Winter Quarter 2010.
“ Administrative changes would 
happen with the agreement of the campus, the senior vice chancellor of Academic Affairs  and the UC 
Office of the President, ” Sawrey said. “Curricular changes would need the approval of the Academic Senate — which means both UC-wide com-
mittees and local committees, such as the Committee on Educational Policy. ”
Sawrey said 
that the com-mittee will try to maintian the program's qualtiy despite the inevi-table cuts.
“UCDC is a 
wonderful pro-gram and is very strong, ” Sawrey said. “Most stu-dents find it to be a life-chang-ing experience. I visited our stu-dents last fall and found them to be a dedicated and mature group of people who were passionate about their work. ”
Ariane Myers-Turnbull, a recent 
UCSD graduate who participated in the program in Spring Quarter 2009, said that her experience with UCDC helped determine her career path.
“I decided on doing UCDC 
instead of going abroad, and I feel like it was the more valuable choice, ” Myers-Turnbull said. “I found the experience valuable for giving me work experience and introducing me to D.C. political culture. ”
Kernell said that although the 
future of the program remains uncer-tain, big changes are coming.
“I’m concerned the program 
will change in ways making it more expensive or less attractive, ” Kernell said. “I encourage all interested stu-dents to get involved now. ”

After a 20-minute wait, always-feisty 
West Coast rapper the Game strut-
ted onto stage, wasting no time before addressing his latest beefs. He dissed former affiliate 50 Cent’s crew with a crowd-backed chant of “G-U not,”  
then earned scattered “boos” when he attempted a round of “Fuck Jay-Z!”  
After pulling about 30 female stu-
dents from the crowd to dance on stage behind a huge posse of towel-tossing homies, the Game lifted two heavy gold chains from around his neck and gifted them to a girl on his left. 
Near the end of his performance, 
the Game’s deejay started mash-ing Michael Jackson and Jackson 5 tracks in tribute to the recently deceased pop star. However, the Game soon motioned to cut the lightweight beats, asserting that he “ain’t one of them guys, ” and that he “likes pussy — a lot of it. ”
“I thought it was pretty out there, ”  
Sixth College freshman Ryan Brown said. “I definitely thought it was rude. I didn’t like how he kept putting on the Michael Jackson and then stop-ping it to put on something else. ”
Warren freshman William Cho 
agreed that the Game was disrespectful.
“The only [other] bad thing was 
so many people were smoking weed and I could hardly breathe, ” Cho said.
The A.S. Council moved its annu-
al festival from the usual location at RIMAC Arena to Warren Field this year. The field’s 10,000-person capac-ity was large enough to hold all who wished to attend — including about 500 faculty, alumni and nonaffiliates who had purchased tickets for $18. 
Last year, FallFest headliner Lupe 
Fiasco attracted approximately 6,500 attendees. However, 2,000 angry stu-dents — collectively yelling “Fuck A.S. ” — were turned away after RIMAC Arena reached maximum capacity.
Associate Vice President of 
Programming Alex Bramwell said his department spent $135,000 on the con-cert this year, compared to the $90,000 spent in 2008.
“It’s more expensive because 
we had to bring the services like the dressing rooms for the artists, catering, the stage — the backstage area had to be built from scratch, ” Bramwell said. 
According to Bramwell, the fes-
tival’s security staff was increased to about 50 this year to confront threats posed by the larger, more open venue. 
“The venue is so much larger and 
there’s so many more holes and ways to get in, ” Bramwell said. “We were a 
little on edge because of the border-line riots [last year]. ”
Despite five alcohol-related cita-
tions and one arrest, Bramwell said things were running well enough by 9 p.m. to send home four of the eight police officers hired for the night.
“We think everything went really 
smoothly, it’s my definite recommenda-tion to keep the set up relatively similar [next year], ” Bramwell said. “The field left us for plenty of room to grow. ”

In an attempt to enliven my 
hellish three-hour gap between classes, I’ve taken to visiting 
AOL.com in search of the bizarre news that doesn’t quite make it on the nightly 6 p.m. broadcast.
One such item I recently found 
takes the cake for most intense fight ever between man and machine: Evidently, a 40-year-old dude from Georgia  became so frustrated with 
an airp ort’s self-serve kiosk that he 
right-hooked its touchscreen until — $15,000 worth of damages later — he was arrested. 
His reasoning? The defenseless 
little machine was taking too long to accept his information.
Real smooth, man. It goes without saying that this 
guy needs some psychiatric assis-tance. But what I can’t figure out is why the kiosk, and not some sloth-ful airport employee? 
Sure, we’ve all experienced melt-
downs prompted by research papers and the death of our childhood pet, but it’s not every day one’s stress is relieved by destroying such an expensive inanimate object. (Or, if it is, one should at least hold the excuse of having consumed a large quantity of tequila beforehand).
What places Kiosk Basher in a 
special category is his opponent: technology. That’s right, Basher is someone we can refer to as a neo-felon: an individual who com-mits a crime against our modern techno fetish  (don’t Google that). 
He exp ected the unknowing little 
airport kiosk to make his life easier, when it actually made his life hard-er — which, to man on the go, is 
downright unacceptable. Machines, after all, are supposed to be our slaves.
I can’t say I’ve never felt Basher’s 
pain. When I swipe my credit card at a parking meter  only to find it’s 
out of order, I do indeed feel the innate urge to kick the bitch where it hurts — but then I tell myself that 
a broken toe and a probable fine won’t make her spit out a parking pass. At which point I grudgingly (gasp!) drive to the machine in the next lot over.  
If there’s one lesson we can 
learn from others’ humiliation, though, it’s that the ominous rain-bow wheel does not — I repeat, does not — give you license to hurl your MacBook through a window. Suppose there’s a freshman standing on the ground floor of Tioga right as your iLife comes hurtling out of the heavens. Oops! Y ou just got 
sued for giving him a concussion.
Just consider Basher. He’ll 
never have the pleasure of sam-
pling Delta Airlines’ mouth-
watering peanuts, ever again. 
Nevertheless, there are still 
some people who will feel the 
carnal need to destroy. Going back 
to our friend with the temper, let’s 
make something clear: Gentlemen, if you’re going to try to prove your strength and manliness in public, don’t attempt to kick the ass of a 
malfunctioning machine. Believe

HIGHER EDUCATION —  Understandably, admission pamphlets 
have long painted their universities to be faultless havens of higher 
learning with impossibly diverse student populations. But a more honest day is dawning: Dozens of admissions offices across the country are beginning to feature student-written blogs on their Web sites which present real, firsthand perspectives on the college expe-rience. If only for the sake of not wasting the time of new freshmen and transfers applying to UCSD, ours would be wise to do the same.The concept behind the blog is simple: offer prospective 
students a glimpse of the next few years of their life before unloading their duffel bags onto those sin-drenched mattresses and tearfully hugging mom goodbye. The blog should, ideally, transcend cheery admissions-office propaganda to reveal what on-campus living is actually like.

Staff Writer
ON CAMPUS —  The budget crisis 
has claimed plenty of victims at UCSD. Now, joining TA salaries and an array of German Literature courses already in tragic extinc-tion is the beloved senior-seminar program.
Last year, UCSD seniors had the 
chance to take a single-unit, 20-stu-dent course on a highly specific topic of their choice, ranging from “Hearing Racialized Gender” to 
“The Hermit: Solitude, Society and 
the Search for Meaning. ” 
From its conception in Fall 
Quarter 2006, the senior seminar program was designed to provide seniors with a uniquely small dis-cussion setting. After funding was eliminated this year, however, the popular scheduling-filling program shrunk from 28 courses to four.
Under budgetary circumstances, 
the seminars may have seemed an unfortunate but necessary sacrifice: On the surface, seminar students seem to do little more than dip their toes into a highly specific area of concentration. But the opportunity for a close-knit learning environ-ment is a rare one at a school of over 22,000. 
University officials have already 
acknowledged the need to avoid individual anonymity by splitting students up into six smaller col-leges. In an academic setting, how-ever, students risk getting lost in the shuffle.
In the past, the professors who 
chose to teach senior seminars have gotten $1,500 in research money for their efforts. Though four admi-rable professors chose to run semi-nars for free this quarter, we can’t expect all faculty members facing pay cuts, layoffs and furloughs to 
assume the full burden of saving the 
program on their own dime.
Seeing as freshman seminars 
(single-unit courses geared toward younger students) have retained full funding for this school year, it only seems fair that academic affairs should spread the love. If stipends were reduced across the board, it would be possible to offer $1,000 
in research grants — as opposed to 
the previous $1,500 — to profes-sors that may want to teach senior seminars, but cannot spare the time and effort without some kind of compensation. 
Without a range of senior semi-
nars in different areas of study (last year they were offered in 16 differ-ent departments; this year they’re in four), there exist few last-minute chances to create the kind of rela-tionship with a professor that can turn out personal enough to land a job after graduation. 
Administrators often brag about 
their world-class researchers and professors, but if students don’t get the chance to get to know those trailblazers, they’re missing out on a large part of what makes our school so outstanding. Seminars 
create an opportunity worth far 
more than the small amount of funding they once received, and somewhat reducing that amount would be preferable to com-pletely denying seniors some much-needed face time with instructors. 
Even if a little fund-sharing 
is impossible, that doesn’t mean we should keep seniors 30 rows back. Perhaps professors from a variety of departments could offer an open forum discussion each month — if necessary, requiring online event registration beforehand to limit capacity. Though a one-night presentation wouldn’t substitute the senior-seminar experience, students 
could still learn about a subject near and dear to a variety of professors’ hearts and chat over snacks after-ward. The university’s top academic priority should be providing stu-dents with the kind of connections that lead to professional opportuni-ties down the line.

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL
 By Priscilla Lázaro
On the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology’s Web site, student blog-
ger and MIT senior Cristen Chinea does just that: 
“There’ve been several times 
when I felt like I didn’t really fit in at MIT, ” she wrote.  “I nearly fell asleep 
during a ‘Star Wars’ marathon. It wasn’t a result of sleep deprivation. I was bored out of my mind. ”
Chinea’s confession might not be 
the most encouraging information a starry-eyed MIT hopeful could stum-ble upon, but it serves a much higher purpose than university propaganda.
Such candor is absent on UCSD’s 
admissions Web site. Here, prospec-tive Tritons may find only a single student-drafted (though far from uncensored) summary of each col-lege. 
Under ucsd.edu’s “Student Voices” 
tab, Hochung from Revelle College (who appears to be surname-less for personability’s sake ), for instance, writes that “the resident advisors at Revelle are our first and last stop for everything, ” and that he “[studies] hard during the week [with] no time for slacking off. ”
The most humanizing part of 
Hochung’s post comes in the revela-tion that he has a boogie board, and that he is definitely trying to use it more often.
While the obvious effort here 
is to depict UCSD as a prestigious place of learning (hey, must be true if Hochung says so) that one would be honored to call home, that clearly isn’t everyone’s story. 
Besides, at selective schools like 
MIT or UCSD, posting the truth might save universities a whole lot of time sorting applications.   
 Reluctant admissions offices 
may be concerned that such honesty will scare applicants away — but with over 47,000 applicants last year (more than any other UC campus), the UCSD Office of Admissions need not worry that the pool of eager freshmen is going to dry up just because of a few students’ rants. If anything, being more forthright would attract those students who will fit in well here and eliminate the costs of an unnecessarily inflated applicant pool.
Unless you’re one of the fortu-
nate few who have an older friend at UCSD to steer you away from Plaza Cafe’s soggy pasta and Eleanor Roosevelt College’s deathly Making of the Modern World GE, UCSD — and each of its colleges — remains no more than an enigma before those first eye-opening weeks. 
An admissions blog in which 
students could describe their lives at UCSD candidly would publicize a wealth of crucial knowledge to those who need it most, and instill a sense of trust in new students  that they’re 
not just being fed a load of propa-ganda. 
A better-informed applicant pool 
would, if anything, give way to a more motivated, in-the-loop student body — one that actually wants to be here, since they’ll have learned some of our strengths and flaws well before move-in day.
Student blogs may not seem ideal 
as press releases to the suits more accustomed to giving speeches on Sixth College’s “effective global citi-zens” to wide-eyed high schoolers. But publicizing both the positives and negatives of a UCSD educa-tion would not only make us more compelling; it might even save the university some precious time and resources.

That’s right: 
Punching your laptop after “Force Quit” freezes your system, though momentarily satisfying, will only result in greater catas-trophe. Not only have you probably punched away over a grand in damage, you’ve shat-tered the small pinch of pride man still holds over machine in the modern age. We must remember that techno-

This summer, Albert Yu-Min Lin — a 
former Ph.D. student at UCSD and current researcher for the Center for Interdisciplinary Science in Art, Architecture and Archaeology — trav-
eled to Mongolia in search of Genghis Khan’s undiscovered tomb. And he wasn’t alone: Following Lin were six large vehicles stuffed with thousands of dollars in Geographic Information Systems technology, three goats, two yurts, a small cadre of horses, a Global Positiong System-guided aircraft (for aerial photography) and a 19-member team of engi-neers, scientists, Mongolian interpreters and service workers.
 But not a single shovel.
Lin proposed a noninvasive approach to 
locating the infamous Mongolian emperor’s 
grave, and his vision was soon sponsored by the National Geographic Society. During the month of July, he and his team collected hundreds of kilometers worth of satellite images, using a remote-controlled aircraft for later analysis using Calit2’s high-tech visualization tools — all in hopes of locating the Valley of the Khans. 
Considering Khan’s expansive 13th-century 
legacy across Eurasia, locating the tomb would be difficult even if shovels were allowed. All Lin had for reference was an ancient legend saying that after his death in the summer of 1227 A.D., 
Khan was buried somewhere in the Liupan 
mountains of northern China at Burkhan 
Kaldun — the holy mountain at whose 
base Khan prayed before going to war.
According to said lore, after Khan’s 
death, his men corralled over 40 
horses to trample over any trace of 
his burial — but not before divert-
ing a nearby river to flood out 
every last speck of evidence. 
Lin conceived the project 
in Spring Quarter 2008, after earning his Ph.D. and finding a supportive colleague in professor Maurizio Seracini, director of CISA3 (the uni-versity’s center for reconstructing and analyzing the history of archaeological sites and artifacts) and principal investigator behind the search for Leonardo da Vinci’s lost painting Battle of 
Anghiari. Seracini brought Lin on board after learning of the researcher’s interest in restoring the good name of Khan, an oft-misrepresented historical figure.
“There’s a whole history here about a merce-
nary that’s affected everything we know today, ” Lin said. “He created the trade routes we know today: He created the communication link between the East and the West. He was very, very forward-thinking and I think that’s what should be told. ” 
The Valley of the Khans project will run 
until 2011, when the team plans on digging deeper into the satellite imagery they collected this summer by exploring identified abnormali-ties with ground-penetrating radar. Until then, however, they’ve been surveying the mountain range by foot while taking photos by air.
Lin stressed his concern over the recent rise 
in rogue mining and illegal looting in the area Khan could be buried in. He hopes to encourage international organizations such as UNESCO to protect the historically rich region. By creat-ing a sanctuary, Lin said we can preserve the cultural heritage of a man who conquered more in one lifetime than the Roman Empire did in 14 centuries. 
Soon after Lin decided to embark on the 
mission to Mongolia, Nate Ricklin — a graduate student who first knew Lin through their shared interest in mountain climbing — joined the team as an operational engineer. 
He quickly created a Web site for the project, 
helping to draw some public interest. 
From there, the expedition snowballed. 
Companies like GeoEye (which manufactures satellite imagery products), RP Flight Systems 
(which specializes in aerial data-collection sys-
tems) and the North Face (which sells outdoor gear and clothing) lined up to sponsor Lin’s vision.
Searching among mountain ranges that were 
blockaded for over 800 years by Khan’s men and occupied by the Russians throughout the 20th century, the team worked with a large gamut of gear and technological equipment to survey the region.
Lin said that when he arrived in 
Ulaanbaatarr — Mongolia’s sprawling capital — he realized just how ubiquitous Khan was to the people of Mongolia and their culture.

at the 
Professional and Graduate School Fair Library Walk 10:30 am–2:30 pmGenghis Khan vodka, there’s Genghis 
Khan cigarettes, there’s Genghis Khan everything, ” Lin said. 
The team met with the Mongolian 
Academy of Sciences to discuss their route through the Liupan mountains. Lin’s team wasn’t the first to seek out the clandestine crypt. A Japanese team tried with no luck in 1990, and Chicago millionaire Maury Kravitz was just as unsuccessful in an amateur attempt at the turn of the millennium. 
“Our goal was to focus on the fact 
that we were scientific and academic, ” Ricklin said. “Y ou know, that’s what we could offer. ” 
Without laying a finger on the 
land, the team surveyed the vast plains and used a remote-controlled aircraft to locate any oddities visible above ground that could have been Khan’s tomb. Now that they’re back at UCSD, they hope to use the visu-alization tools at Calit2 to convert high-resolution satellite imagery into virtual reality.
 Lin’s noninvasive approach aimed 
to avoid damage caused by excavation. 
“I think as the world becomes 
more global, it’s important for people to respect traditions of individual countries and individual civilizations, ” Lin said.
According to Lin, many people 
in Mongolia believe that disturbing a tomb not only unsettles its occupant’s rest, but also prevents the spirits from entering heaven. During Khan’s time, warlords would desolate enemy tombs as the first step to overtaking an adver-sary’s land. 
Lin’s team departed Ulaanbaatarr 
on horseback, riding more than 20 kilometers into the regions of the North where visitors were previously forbidden.
Surveying the corrugated valleys 
snaking through the mountainous ter-rain, Lin and his team spent each day trekking over what they could only speculate was the mountain range that Burkhan Kaldun sat among. 
Kostas Stamatiou, a UCSD gradu-
ate student who recently earned his doctorate in electrical engineering, served as the team’s historian. 
“What we know from the sources 
is Genghis worshipped the mountain, ” Stamatiou said. “So there’s speculation that he might be buried there, but the problem is that nobody really knows which mountain Burkhan Kaldun is t o d a y.”
Working with unmanned aerial 
vehicle (UAV) specialist Michael Hennig, the team launched a remote-controlled aircraft to capture more images of potential burial sites than any 19-person team could ever be expected to sort through. 
Currently, the visual data is being 
reorganized at Calit2 into material to be viewed on StarCAVE — a 3D, five-wall virtual-reality room designed to make the viewer feel as if he or she is flying over the Gobi desert — and HIPerWall, the world’s highest-resolu-tion multi-screen display system.
“Can you imagine trying to look 
through thousands of square kilome-ters on a little laptop?” Lin said. “It’s not going to happen, or on a desktop. Y ou’ d spend the rest of your life trying to get your computer not to crash. ”
The project will enter its third 
phase by 2010. Using electromag-netic induction, magnetometry and ground-penetrating radar, Lin hopes his satellite imagery — when viewed in StarCAVE and on HIPerWall — could peer into the ground beneath possible sites of Khan’s tomb. 
Until then, Lin and his team plan 
on returning to Mongolia next sum-mer to wrap up the ground surveys they started this past July.

UnscriptedThere comes a time when the late-
night trek to one of the two La Jolla Village Square movie the-
aters gets old. Maybe you’ve popped too many neck veins attempting to maneuver through the Ralphs parking lot. Maybe you’re just sick of forking over $10 every time you’ve got a crav-ing to see 50 luscious feet of Megan Fox. Or maybe the sweaty 20-minute walk from campus is still keeping you from reaching second base — no mat-ter how many painstakingly cheesy Julia Roberts movies you pay for.     When you’ve reached your break-ing point, Santee Drive-in is waiting.
Sure, Santee’s dinky old road stop of 
an establishment may be a good 30-min-ute drive from our manicured La Jolla paradise, and it’s not exactly the most luxurious movie seat this side of the Pacific (unless you drive an Escalade). But it does operate on one ingenious principle: more for less.
At these grungy drive-in digs, an 
$8 double-feature ticket will admit you to a concrete playground where the struggle for parking is obsolete, grubbing and boozing need not be conspicuous and your Volkswagen’s tinted back windows can finally reach their full potential.
Even better: No one will judge you 
for it. Santee’s crowd — though not the most elegant bunch — knows how to watch a movie. Y ou could even take a tip or two from the drive-in regu-lars: They are pioneers of the open truck bed turned couch, collectors of lawn chairs, connoisseurs of dinner in a bag and authorities on the warm six-pack (and warm blankets). 
Santee’s only breach of the more-
for-less principle falls under film selection. In this case, a cheap ticket means you only have two double features from which to choose. Until Oct. 15, viewers can opt for “Couples Retreat” paired with “Love Happens” or “The Surrogate” with “The Informant. ” They’re packaged by genre, and won’t be obscure enough to score you indie points . But if you 
happen to find yourself overcome by boredom, try plan B: Recline your seat, take a swig of two-buck Chuck and soak in the darkness. I guarantee you’ll find some way to pass the time.

set, the Tritons called another timeout. 
UCSD returned with two straight 
points to tie the set 23-23. Two points 
away from a victory, the team came through with an ace and a kill to finish off the Lumberjacks 25-23. 
Oct. 10’s match pitted UCSD 
against the Sonoma State Seawolves  — the Triton’s fourth nationally ranked  
opponent of the season. The Seawolves provided a serious challenge for UCSD, leaping ahead early in the first set. 
Despite rallying back to with-
in one point at 20-19, the Tritons couldn’t overcome Sonoma, who held on to win 25-21. 
UCSD had not lost a single set in 
either of their previous three games.
In the second set, the Tritons and 
Seawolves played close, but strong hit-ting gave the Seawolves the second set win at 30-28. 
The loss marked the first time the 
Tritons had dropped two sets in a match since Sept. 18.
“They were playing really well, ” 
Black said. “They are a good team, and we were a little uncomfortable. ” 
After the break, the Tritons came 
out resilient, taking a 15-3 lead due to a spectacular serving streak from Schmidt. There was little stopping the Tritons’ relentless assault as they hand-ily defeated the Seawolves 25-7. 
The Seawolves never held a lead in the fourth set, but stayed close throughout the game.
The Tritons were able to pull 
away late in the set and defeated the Seawolves 25-22 to force a decisive fifth set. 
“I think from the second half 
of game two, we had control of the match, ” Black said. “We were play-ing more like ourselves again and we really had our rhythm going into the third set. ” 
In the fifth set, the Tritons went 
up 4-0 before the Seawolves could get on the board. With strong serving, the Tritons took a 10-1 lead and cruised through the rest of the match, winning 15-6 to cap an impressive turnaround victory. 
The comeback win was sparked 
by UCSD’s offensive attack, which included Schmidt’s record perfor-mance. Her 31 kills were the most since former Triton Janet Hughes notched the same number in a game on Oct. 23, 1987. 
The Tritons return home next 
weekend as they face Cal Poly Pomona on Oct. 16 and No. 2 Cal State San Bernardino on Oct. 17. 
“I’m looking forward to next week-
end, ” Black said. “It’s a high profile game, and it’s what college volleyball is about. ”

post with seven seconds left — the Tritons managed to hold on for the victory. 
Samaniego and junior midfielder 
David Bakal combined for 12 of the Tritons’ 18 shots on Friday. Akman had four saves.
Samaniego opened up the scoring 
in the 21st minute, driving the ball up the left side of the field and booting a shot past the East Bay keeper from far  upfield. 
The Pioneers fought back to tie 
things up with just 50 seconds left in the half. East Bay’s Aric Johnson and Ryan Herriage earned assists on the goal as sophomore midfielder Manny Cardenas drove a shot past Akman. 
The game's first half saw a total of 
21 attempts from both sides. 
Bakal put the Tritons back in the 
lead when he touched in a cross from junior midfielder Shane Mitchell, from right in front of the net. The goal was Bakal’s second of the season. 
In the 83rd minute, a pioneer 
foul earned the Tritons a penalty kick. Samaniego took advantage of the opportunity and came through with a conversion, giving UCSD a comfortable 3-1 lead with seven minutes left. 
The Pioneers started their comeback 
in the 87th minute, when freshman defender Michael Rossi tapped a ball past Akman, off a rebound. Hanging by their last thread, the Pioneers managed three more shots in the game, including a heart-stopping kick by freshman forward Arnoldo Mendoza — which barely missed the net and bounced off  the post instead.

Riley also stressed the benefit of 
running with teammates.
“We started well as a solid group 
of five guys, ” Riley said. “We moved up in the pack that way, and it really helped us out. ”
Cal Poly Pomona had four run-
ners finish in the top 10 for a score of 29 points, which won the meet. 
UCSD tallied 88 points to fin-
ish second out of eight competing teams.
On the women’s side, one indi-
vidual performance stood out to boost the Tritons’ final score: The All-American Schofield ran the women’s 6K course in a time of 22:20, finishing fourth overall as UCSD’s top finisher. 
Sophomore Elena Inouye was the 
next Triton finisher, clocking a time of 22:58 for 13th place. 
Junior Brianna Alban, sopho-
more Aaryn Kobayashi and senior Marie Schaper ran together to round out the Tritons’ scoring on the day — finishing 22nd, 23rd and 24th, respectively.
Central Arizona College won the 
meet on the women’s side with a score of 59 points. UCSD’s score of 80 points set them just a sliver away from the University of Victoria’s total of 78, putting the Tritons in fourth place out of the 13 squads that participated. 
Garcia emphasized the impor-
tance orunning at home before entering the season’s final stages.
“I think any time we can get on 
a familiar course, its good for us, ” Garcia said. “I think where the big advantage came is with the great support we had out there. We had a lot of student athletes out there and a 
lot of other students, and getting that kind of support is really important to our team. ”
The Tritons’ next race will 
be at the California Collegiate Athletic Association Conference Championships on Oct.  24. The 
conference finals will be hosted by Humboldt State University in 
Arcata, Calif.

lfrose@ucsd.edu.Wong, who entered the game 
with just three season goals, com-pleted her hat trick in the 61st min-ute with a driving shot from the top of the penalty box, off a pass from freshman midfielder Gabi Hernandez.
Sophomore forward Sarah 
McTigue gave UCSD a 4-0 lead in the 64th minute. After receiving a ball from Wi, she placed a shot inside the far post. 
Freshman midfielder Alexa 
Enlow finished the Triton scoring in the 81st  minute, heading in a 
corner kick from junior midfielder Remy Hitt.
The Tritons kept their offensive 
attack consistent, outshooting the Vikings 19-9 as Wong and McTigue added 11 shots. 
UCSD’s defense was just as solid 
in the victory. Sophomore goalkeep-er Kristin Armstrong and freshman goalkeeper Kimberly Cushing com-bined for the shutout — UCSD’s sixth of the year. 
Armstrong made three saves in 
75 minutes, and Cushing picked up a save in the final 15 minutes of the match.
The Tritons have scored a total 
of thirteen goals over their past six games. With only seven games left in the regular season and playoffs looming on the horizon, head coach Brian McManus believes UCSD is finally performing to the best of its ability. 
McManus hopes the team con-
tinues this level of play for the remainder of the regular season, and throughout the playoffs.
“We’ve been talking about shoot-
ing all year, but tonight we tried it, ” McManus said. “Tonight we did things smart in the box and took our chances. ”
After winning nine of their 
last ten matches, the Tritons  will 
attempt to extend the six-game win-ning streak when it takes on confer-ence opponent Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson, Calif. on Oct. 16. Kickoff is set for 7 p.m.
The game will be a rematch of 
last season’s CCAA championship game, when the Tritons beat the Toros 3-1.

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — 
The No. 3 women’s volleyball team completed a two-game road trip on Oct. 10, going undefeated and watching their star player tie an all-time school record. 
UCSD defeated Humboldt 
State on Oct. 9 before beating No. 17 Sonoma State on Oct. 10. Senior outside hitter Sylvia Schmidt recorded 31 kills to tie UCSD’s single-match record. 
Halfway through their con-
ference schedule, the Tritons’ record stands at 18-1. They sit in second place, one game behind CCAA leader Cal State 
San Bernardino.
UCSD started slow in the match against Humboldt State, unable to pull away from the 
Lumberjacks. However, with the score tied at 12-12, UCSD had a breakout set, and took a 19-13 lead. 
Despite the surge, the 
Lumberjacks slowly fought their way back into the match, pulling within 20-17 — but 
three quick kills by the Tritons 
closed the game at 25-20 and sealed the first set. 
At the start of the second 
set, the Tritons fell behind, but recovered with a 12-2 run that pushed them to a 19-10 lead. Down eight points, the Lumberjacks stormed back to come within two points at 20-18 — forcing UCSD to take a timeout. 
“We were playing the 
point, ” head coach Tom Black said. “We needed to focus. We were just thinking about what we needed to do next. ”
After the break, the Tritons 
regained their composure fin-ished off a 25-20 victory.

UCSD in each of the first two 
sets, the Lumberjacks took a

MEN’S SOCCER — The Tritons came 
out swinging this weekend, both at home and on the road, completing their first sweep of the season. 
Facing Cal State East Bay, UCSD 
scored a season-high three goals to triumph 3-2 on Oct. 9. Two days later, a shorthanded UCSD team finished off the Pioneers 2-0.
“We were definitely the better team 
in both games, ” senior forward Tony Choi said. “We had control throughout most of both games. Friday we were just not completely there,  giving up a couple of very weak goals. [Sunday] it was a much different story because we knew exactly what they were going to do, and we were better prepared and more mentally focused to get the job done. ”
UCSD now stands 7-3-4, with 
a California Collegiate Athletic Association record of 4-3-3. In its first season in the CCAA, Cal State East Bay sports a dismal 1-13 overall and a 0-10 league record. 
The Tritons will face a tougher 
test on the road against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills this weekend. CSDH 
currently sits in second place in the CCAA South Division, with a 7-4-1 record in conference play. 
On Sunday, the Tritons came out 
with a bang by scoring within the third minute of the first half. The shot came from junior midfielder Aaron McDowell — his first goal of the season. 
Although UCSD dominated the 
first half of the game and outshot the Pioneers 10-3, the game plan shifted when junior forward Mikel Samaniego was red-carded, leaving the Tritons a man short. 
Despite the penalty, the Tritons 
kept up a solid defense, limiting the Pioneers to three shots on goal. 
UCSD’s second goal came off junior 
midfielder Shane Micheil’s pass to freshman midfielder Kian Malek, who shot a low ball past the East Bay keeper for a 2-0 Triton lead. The shutout was senior keeper Peter Akmans’ sixth of the season. 
“We ran into a bit of adversity 
with going down a man, due to a red card, for a majority of the game, ” Choi said. “We've been in a similar situation before, though, and we stuck together and battled through. Our bench did a great job of coming on the field to bring some fresh legs and energy, because we had to help cover for the extra man. Our coach John has always stressed that we will beat teams with 
our bench and that we have one of 
the deepest teams. That really showed t o d a y.”
Samaniego, a Seattle University 
transfer, led the Tritons with two goals scored. 
Despite a late comeback from East 
Bay — including a goal in the 88th 5MV.QVQ[P

CROSS COUNTRY — The Tritons took full advantage of their final home meet of the regular season, turning in strong performances  at 
Saturday’s annual Triton Classic. Both the men’s  and women’s team

finish. 
Now that their regular season is 
over, the Tritons will focus on pre-paring for the conference champion-ships, set to begin Oct. 24. 
“I was pleased, ” head coach Nate 
Garcia said. “On our course, it’s important to be patient early on and really attack the second half, and both of our squads did a very good job of that. ”
Sophomore Jeremy Riley led the 
men’s team by placing 10th, finish-ing the 10K course in 33:37. He was followed closely by senior Mike Wright in 11th place. Sophomores John Svet, Alex Corliss and Andre LaMothe posted the only other Triton scores: 14th, 17th and 20th,  
respectively.

in packs with their teammates, pac-ing each other and contributing to the team’s strong final score.
“We saw some real important 
team grouping, ” Garcia said. “Pairs of people were running together throughout the race, and there’s no way to overstate how important that By John Beck
