A Real Mean One
UCSD admnistrators have report-
edly invested up to $5.2 million in the creation of a mind-controlling gas which would help regulate campus cli-mate, according to recently leaked internal documents.
Correspondence between Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox and head chemists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory reveal that the gas — which is said to be formed by fusing real pain particles with real tear particles (along with any light-col-ored food, such as brie or macadamea nuts) By Stander
Foxy Laaady
In response to weeks of harsh 
criticism from members of the Black Student Union — who claim Chancellor Marye Anne Fox has long neglected her duty to recruit and retain more black students on campus — Fox finally emerged from her office last Monday to take a stand against her critics.
“I will not live in this state of mar-
ginalization any longer, ” she said. “I shouldn’t be scared to leave the safety of my office every time I want to walk to the faculty club for some soups. ”
Miraculously, Fox then ceased her 
trembling, and looked her adversaries straight in the eye.
“So bring it on, motherfuckers, ” 
she said, shedding her characteristic warble for a deep, sure baritone.
Vice Chancellor of Student Life 
Penny Rue — wearing a pantsuit that read “Solidarity” across the breast — lingered back near the entrance to the Chancellor’s Complex throughout the one-woman protest.
“I, too, know what it’ s like to be an 
anal-retentive anglo-saxon adminis-trator, loathed and misunderstood by 24,000 rambunctious youth, ” Rue said, empathizing with her boss. “It’s rough out here on Library Walk. I am truly heartsick for the chancellor. ”Fox said her feelings were deeply 
hurt last month when a member of the BSU told her not to “just stand there and look like [she was] dumb. ”
“Doesn’t she know that’s just how I 
look?” Fox asked. 
The chancellor then attempted to 
pass around a petition to shut down the BSU, but it appeared no one would accept the clipboard.“Y ou need to check your privelege 
at the door, Chancellor, ” shouted one student from within the small crowd that had gathered.
“Y ou will definitely be seeing a 
zinger of a campuswide e-mail with-in the next few days containing my retort, ” Fox said. “ And when you read it, I can assure you, you’ll wish you had bought some calemine for that burn. ”

Protests erupted Tuesday after A.S. 
Concerts and Events announced its plans to book the notoriously Jewish 
Matisyahu for the Sun God Festival.
Isaac Goldsteinman, head of Tritons for 
Israel, said he was outraged at the outrage expressed by some members of the UCSD com-munity. He has kvetched that they be expelled.“Matisyahu is an ambassador of rap, and 
he should be respected as such, ” Goldsteinman said. “He represents a very prominent nose — I mean class — of Jew. Did you know Barack Obama is Jewish? True story. ”
Protester and Revelle College sophomore 
Khalid Hasan, however, denied the holicaustical accusations. He said he and his peers are only protesting the artist’s inability to rap.
“Come on, my brother, ” Hasan said. 
“Matisyahu totally blows. Have you heard his Jamaican accent? I’m pretty sure he only puts it on to make his crappy lyrics unintelligable, ” Hasan said. “Jew be trippin’ balls if Jew thinks this is political. ”
When asked to comment on the protests, 
Matisyahu stroked his beard thoughtfully for a few moments before expressing solidarity with his fellow Chosen People.
“I’ll stand on my own two feet/ Won’t be 
brought down on one knee, ” he said. “I’ll fight with all my might and get these demons to flee. ”

through a thermodynamic process — 
will enter testing stages on campus by the end of the 2009-10 academic year.
While e-mail records reveal Fox first 
contacted leading Livermore chemist Donny McChemicals to create the gas in September, it wasn’t until the Black Student Union began protesting on Library Walk that he believed the proj-ect could be feasible.
“We are thrilled to hear about the 
‘Compton Cookout, ’” McChemicals said in what was supposed to be a pri-vate letter to his mother. “This might actually be our chance!”
Though scientists had developed a 
feasible formula for what they’ve copy-righted as Klimate Kontrol Khemicals in January, they were unable to gather a sufficient measurement of real pain and tears to affect an entire college stu-dent body — that is, until BSU protests against racial slurs began mid-February, and supplies skyrocketed.
“It was very fortunate that we were 
able to harvest such a giant supply of the ingredients used to produce KKK, ” McChemicals said in an e-mail to Fox. “On average, we harvest four to five gal-lons the week after the release of every Koala . During the protests, we collected 
4,000 to 5,000 gallons a day. It’s a very good time for science. ”After collecting sufficient materials 
for the project, a group of Livermore Chemists produced a small sample meant to be tested on student subjects in a preliminary trial-run. The team then asked UCSD administrators to choose one student they felt would most benefit from the treatment.
Though there is no hard evidence 
of their choice, A.S. Vice President of Finance and Resources Peter Benesch said he suspects the administration sent A.S. President Utsav Gupta for KKK testing at LLNL under the guise of a student leadership conference.
“Utsav doesn’t want to do anything 
fun anymore, ” Benesch said. “We used to go to movies and play root-beer pong all the time, but now all he wants to do is write policies against hate-speech. I feel so lonely. ”
Gupta declined to comment on the 
conference, but said he was “very happy to be part of such an accepting and diverse campus community. ”
According to LLNL laboratory 
notes, scientists first attempted to blow the KKK up the rear end of the test sub-ject. However, after finding the subject to have an abnormally loose asshole, they constructed a conspicuous, por-table gassing chamber with which to dispense the chemical.
A detailed diagram included in the observations revealed the chamber was constructed to be easily adapted to func-tion within classrooms and lecture halls. Preliminary dispatch reports show the locations for the first machines will like-ly be those with the lowest Principles of Community ratings.
Though Fox has denied the exis-
tence of KKK, she said that the UCSD campus may see an unusual amount of fog over the next couple of weeks.
“We’re testing out our smoke-alarm 
systems for everyone’s safety, ” Fox said. “So please don’t be alarmed if your classes are really hazy or smell like burnt light-colored foods within the next couple weeks — especially in areas with low PC ratings like Geisel Library and the  Koala  office. ”
Additional correspondence between 
Livermore scientists and Chinese gov-ernment officials suggests that if the fog is proven effective in regulating campus climate, it could eventually be used to control the climates of entire countries.
“Y our people have shown exemplary 
levels of real pain, tears and white-rice production, ” McChemicals said to Chinese President Hu Jintao in an e-mail. “But you’ll probably need at least a 6.5 earthquake, in addition to especially discriminatory government crimes. But we’ll contact you if we find any sufficient chemical replacements. ”to the “toxic” campus climate. She said she was on her way to ethnic studies on Monday when she first heard the slurs.
“It was just this barage of all these 
racist and homophobic lyrics, ” Pae said. “It turned out to be Jay-Z’s ‘Can I Get A... ’ . Do you know how many fucking times they say the N-word in that song?”
Her accusations were echoed by 
other concerned students, including Muir College sophomore Samantha Peterson, who reported hearing snippets of Lil Wayne talking through the tree, saying, “Girl I got that dope dick/ now come here and let me dope you. ” 
Peterson said she was mortified. “First racism, and now this 
mysoginistic filth — this is a state of emergency, ” Peterson said. “ As both a recovering drug addict and an active sex addict, I find this very offensive. Does Mr. Wayne think women are just some kind of sex slaves, waiting to lap up his love juice? I don’t think so. ”Loft employee Jeremy Gallagher, 
who officially chooses the material broadcast by the Talking Tree, said the racially charged event was an accident. 
“One of my buddies put the tree on 
station 90.3, which plays a lot of main-stream hip-hop music, ” he said. “
A group of dissenting koala bears 
soon showed up to the protest, holding a tree-sit in the name of protecting the tree from the administrative axe.
Warren College junior and koala 
supporter Daniel Watts said the ter-mination of the Talking Tree would not only be a restriction of its First Amendment rights, but would endanger all free expression at UCSD. ”
“First Jay-Z, next Snoop Dogg and 
Kanye, and then what? Earth, Wind & Fire?” Watts asked. “It’s a slippery slope. ”
KDST Manager Meredith Wong, 
who attended the tree-sit, agreed. She said she feared that if the Talking Tree was cut down, UCSD’s “fiercely inde-pendent” radio station would be next. “KSD-what?” said the dude sitting 
next to Wong.
famed Dr. Suess character the Lorax 
also made a cameo at the tree-sit, mate-rializing before protesters and allegedly relaying the sentiments of the tree.
“I am the Lorax, I speak for this tree/ 
It’s right to free speech, to play its Jay-Z!” he said. “ And where will the koa-la-loots go, who live in the trees?/ Superfluous lawsuits are what nobody needs!”
The latest racially charged inci-
dent has inspired further investigation into other possible subliminal racism on campus. Sixth College sophomore Christopher Sweeten, who spoke at the tree-sit, said he discovered that another piece in the Stuart Art Collection — the giraffe catcher — forms a large, white “W” when viewed from a helicopter.
“It’s awfully suspicious, when one 
considers that W stands for White power, ” Sweeten said. “We are in a state of campus emergency. Hear me when I say, it’s time to cut down the trees!”

CELEBRATION.NOOSE THURSDAY , APRIL 1, 2010  THE DISREGUARDIAN D3 
By Robbie Williams
Copy Righter
Scientists at the biophysi-
chemiengineering nanoscience department have teamed up to 
create a super-elastic performance-enhancing bouncy glue for the men’s basketball team, an effort to push the Tritons to Division-I.
UCSD researcher Lithra 
Pratramianiamamlan explained that after scouring hours of footage from last year’s season, he and fellow sci-entists made a startling discovery. “Suddenly it dawned on us, ” said Pratramianiamamlan. “The team’s core inefficiencies seem to stem from unusually low levels of skill. ”
According to the researcher, dras-
tic measures needed to be taken. He wanted to find a way to improve the team’s performance, while simulta-neously teaching the players a valu-able lesson in friendship.
“We rented every sports comedy 
we could find in the family section of Blockbuster, ” he said.
At first, the Triton men’s basket-
ball team tried playing alongside a golden retriever. Former starting point guard Mathew Miller recalled the humiliation of being replaced by a quadruped.
“Buddy was a good boy, but he 
was never a team player, ” Miller said. “Every time he got the ball, we would all have to pretend we didn’t want it before he would pass. I don’t think I had been more embarrassed since our scrimmage against the Globetrotters. ”Pratramianiamamlan and his 
colleagues went back to the drawing board. After 15 failed clinical trials, hope was all but lost, the scientist remembered.
“Morale was beginning to 
dwindle, ” graduate student Daniel Yu said. “We tried everything: electrify-ing a pair of Michael Jordan’s shoes, summoning angels from the outfield, turning the bench into a bobsledding team — nothing worked. We even recruited Amanda Bynes to dress up like a boy and play on the team. ”
But just when the scientists were 
about to give up, Yu said they were delivered a small miracle of science. After injecting a hamster with a gene-enhancing super-soldier tonic, the team made an unexpected dis-covery. 
“The hamster spontaneously 
liquefied, leaving behind a green, bouncy substance, ” Yu said. “It was positively bursting with potential energy. ”
Pratramianiamamlan said he has 
dubbed the substance “flying rub-ber. ” 
“We haven’t been able to come up 
with a catchy abbreviation yet, but we’ve got some friends at the litera-ture department hot on that trail. ”
The discovery has come as a 
relief to both the department and the men’s basketball team.
“More than 60 percent of our 
points come from cross-court dunks now!  It’s like something out of a John Wu film, ” head couch John Linnmen said. “The team was just bumped up to D-I, and is scheduled to play a group of animated, under-sized space aliens for the fate of the world next Friday. ”
Pratramianiamamlan said he is 
proud to have found a solution to the basketball team’s problem outside the sports movie aisle.
“So far as we know, there isn’t 
anything like ‘flying rubber’ in a sin-gle family sports movie, which is a great source of pride for the depart-ment, ” Yu said, beaming. “We’re all glad to finally have that monkey off our backs. ”

Being the easy-going gal I am, 
it’s not too often I get upset about anything beyond the 
lack of pomegranate syrup on campus (seriously, Cafe V — WTF??), but this much I will say. And I will say it loud and proud. I am fed up to here (*here!*) with the way the BSU is handling itself in this whole ridicu-lous excuse for a hot mess.  
Before you all start getting on my 
ass about how I’m just perpetuating ignorant white supremacy, I’m gonna tell you something only my best friend JJ and whoever dragged me to 
the Tigerheat bathroom last Saturday 
have ever accurately guessed — some-thing that never fails to shock both the guys who give me a once-over in the locker room and the co-leads in all my high school musicals: I’m … gay. 
Y ou’ d never know it, really. I don’t 
shop at American Apparel, and I haven’t watched Oprah since she got fat again. But after the actions of the BSU fucked us all harder than a nine-incher through the backdoor last quarter, I’m ready to break my silence. 
Oh, don’t 
you play dumb with me, you little minx: I’m talking about the gay dance — or what was supposed  
to be the gay dance, before those people  
came along and started changing their Facebook pro-file pics and crying about “pain” and a stupid piece of 
jump rope in the library. 
Y ep. Someone thought it was a 
good idea, just because a few widdle whiney bitches couldn’t take the fact they’re only 13 percent of the cam-pus, to cancel our cherished LGBT Non-Sexist dance (i.e., the only place on this shithole of a straight man’s campus to let the fucking sequins fly and find some decent D twice a quarter).
People say it would’ve been “inap-
propriate” to have fun when there was a protest next to Perks — that there couldn’t be a worse time to celebrate than when other people are like, sad. (Of course, I beg to differ: What better time for an impromptu UTC shopping sesh than when your hippie-ass TA cancels section to wave a picket sign?) But just ’ cause a few peeps got caught 
up in some drama doesn’t mean we’re 
any less entitled to work our magic at Porter’s twice a quarter.  
I think it’s time the Black Straight 
Union or whatever woke up, smelled the coffee and realized that — hell-o! — they’re not the only ones losing 
out here! We are the real victims of 
hate. Until everyone starts to lighten the dumb up and see us for the spar-
kling emblems — beacons, really 
— of fabulousness that we are in this god-awful bubble of sweatpant medi-ocrity, this bitch is gonna be fired up — ‘cause if there’s one thing I can’t 
take no more, it’s goddamn Gance deprivation.  Injustice. It’s a word. A word that means horrible things. Things like murder. Things like 
child labor. Things like the system-atic enslavement of an indigenous race, the rapid destruction of our planet’s rainforests — things like mass genocide and assisted suicide. Injustice cuts like a knife. Injustice burns like a flame.
No injustice, however, is so great 
as that which currently faces the opressed students of the University of California. No murder, no tor-ture, no baby-gutting gunshot to the soul of humanity can compare to the injustice now bearing down on the defenseless young people of this university: the student fee. 
Late last year, the UC Board 
of Regents — arguably the most racist, scheming, perverted group of asshole bigot shitheads ever to slither from the diseased rectum of an undead Nazi — came together at some shmancy whites-only country club for their annual supremicist rally. After nine and a half drug-fueled hours of clubbing Native-American infants (for chuckles) and getting down with the craziest, most fucked up old-people sex you’ve ever seen (for vitality), the geezer freaks had finally decided on a series of proposals. 
And you know what those fat, 
greedy fuckers up and did? They raised our fees. They raised them through the fucking roof, and then sat around laughing about it. They laughed and laughed until they vomited up their imported caviar, and then they laughed some more. Those sister-molesting asstards. Those rat-bastard vultures. Those bald-headed shitstains on the dove-white robe of education.
Y ear after year, just like this, they 
rape us for all we are worth. They suck our humanity. They degrade our society, our lives  — heck, our very existence. They set us back hundreds of years, murdering our parents, euthanizing our kittens and leaving us sobbing to pick up the desolate remains of a once-great university. 
This injustice must end. So Here is our resolution solution: We con-demn fees. We condemn the living hell out of them. Why, you ask? Because of this: Fuck that shit. All of it. Fees suck. They don’t help us at all. When was the last time fees 
did anything good for any-one? Never. Not even once. God, they suck so much.
This is our 
university. Not the regents’ 
university. They don’t even go here. In fact, accord-ing to a recent investigation, 
not a single member of the Board of Regents is a student at the University of California, and almost every single one can be traced back in family lineage to Hitler. No one sucks more than Hitler. The Regents don’t give a damn about us. All they care about is their expensive German sex toys and their fancy imported cocaine and their trillion-dollar paychecks. Damn them all. Damn them all to the seventh story of Geisel.
Now is the time. We must rise 
up and take back what is rightfully ours. We must ignite the revolution and demand our retribution. We must shed the shackles of oppres-sion, break the chains of brutality, spit out the gag ball of torment and crack the whip of action upon the hairy ass of injustice. We must condemn . And we must do it all 
with the most condemning picket signs in the history of condemna-tion. Ones with glitter and stencils and clever-ass puns. Puns that really make those earthworms think , you 
know? Fascist bitches the universe over won’t know what hit them. 
This is it, motherfuckers! Let’s 
get pumped! Let’s get pissed! Let’s drop out of this piece of shit school! Let’s burn it! Burn it the fuck down! BURN THEM ALL AND MAKE THEM W ATCH!!! AAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!

Founder, Dendrophiliacs 4 a Greener Campus
There’s only one way to describe 
communication amongst students, faculty and staff regarding campus-wide sustainability efforts here at 
UCSD: abysmal. Due to this unfor-
tunate and dangerous state of affairs, I’ d like to use the Guardian  — which 
has, in the past, ignorantly skewed the words and intentions of our own ambassadors — to maximize the public’s knowledge on how the UCSD Sustainability Collective is graciously accepting the responsibility of World Protector to shield future generations 
from a slow, sizzling death of ozone-
deficient trash asphyxiation.
Within our Sustainability 
Resource Center’s biodegradable, recyclable and edible walls lies the secret to sustainability: our students’ minds. Collaboration, dedication, determination, communication, action, deliberation, concentration, consideration and a green mindset within our student body directly facil-itate in protecting our human species from extinction in this abused pile of garbage we call Earth.
The SRC coordinators, student 
representatives and janitors have put their heads together recently to gener-ate even better solutions — trumping the establishment of the SRC itself — to keep the world afloat, and you can 
be a part of it.
Alongside our dining halls’ trash, 
recycling and compost bins will be 
the fourth and most recent install-ment of waste compartments: the vomit bucket. Illuminated beneath our campus’ very own sustainable sulfur lights with glow-in-the-dark labeling print, our vomit buckets will allow students to spew directly 
into them during their inevitable, nightly college-kid romps, filling their 
contents with recyclable waste that will later be processed in the new Sustainability Material Conversion 'BDUPSZ	PQFO'BMM2VBSUFSJOEleanor Roosevelt College) to ulti-
mately be reused as biodegradable 
condoms, promoting contraceptive practices to control our planet’s over-population.
The SMCF will be modeled after 
the SRC, using even more innovative, bio-friendly building materials such as sand, ice, chocolate fudge and used Scantrons as its walls, windows, roof and curtains, respectively. If passed 
UIJT4QSJOH2VBSUFSUIF4.$''FF
Referendum will allow all students to take an active role in funding this exciting new development at UCSD. 
Finally, our long-term project set 
GPS'BMM2VBSUFSJOWPMWFTUIFcreative minds of our Sustainability Collective John Muir College student interns. Using a collection of special-ized vacuum cleaners made of gin-gerbread, our interns will accumulate discarded rubber bands, paperclips, staples, crumbs, hairs, used tissues and other miscellaneous debris from the floors of Geisel Library to weave a massive landyard which will, by the aforementioned date, hold every 
key necessary to open and close the UCSD campus.
In conclusion, it is only with par-
ticipation, motivation, inspiration and perspiration that we will be able to terminate this parasitic relationship we have with our planet and instead, treat it tenderly as our sensitive, bountiful host. How we live impacts how long we are able to live, so with 
this in mind, we can choose today to permanently modify our habits to fall in line with those of the Sustainability Collective — making our grass green-er, one blade at a time.

The creation of the team was

to be the official sponsor of the UCSD 
Tritonettes. With corporate fund-ing guaranteed, the UCSD Athletics department moved forward with its official approval of the team. The main obstacle for the team’s implementation was Title IX, which stipulates that all collegiate sports programs must have equal numbers of male and female student athletes.UCSD Athletic Director Earl

In you last issue I saw that you

on an issue someone cares about way too much]. However, when you printed the issue you failed to mention [irrelevant hearsay]. 
When you reported [simple, 
neutral fact] I feel like you missed key elements. Y ou failed to men-tion how [miscellaneous informa-tion that we already heard but disregarded as hearsay]. I agree that [vague statement that shows misunderstanding of article], but this is about [one-sided perspec-tive here].  
Also, I would like to point 
out other inconsistencies in your article such as the remark you made about [correct information]. This is a compeltely false claim, and in reality what happened was [completely incorrect information that tempts Guardian  editors to 
retaliate and make letter-writer look stupid]. If I was writing for a newspaper I would do the job way better and never make such ridicu-lous claims. [Conspiracy theory paragraph.

I think the claim you made 
about [objective, multi-perspective article’s background information] was incorrect because you failed to mention [biased, sort of racist opinion]. 
As [useless student leadership

Ricky Martin likes men, 
and I like 6’2” blondes with cock for miles — 
so what? Nobody gives a fuck. 
If Ricky Martin can get 
attention for coming out, I should be getting attention for enjoying dick-to-mouth. I mean really, who really cares that Ricky Martin “King of open-fronted-shirts-tight-leather-jeans-and-perfectly-trimmed-eyebrows” is gay? He’s almost 40 anyway. The only ass he’ll be able to get is from some wide-eyed 14 year old that wants a brush with sex-tape fame.
What the fuck is so special 
about an old gay-Latin-singer, anyway? Nothing. Nothing at all.  I deserve attention too. I do.  I mean, I’ve done a lot in my life. Just because I’m not gay doesn’t mean I don’t deserve some limelight. Maybe if I were  gay people 
would care more. Actually — hey, that’s not a bad fucking idea. When I make out with girls people notice. 
Hot lesbians.  Drool over 
it, boys — I’m batting for the other team now.
— Need Sattention
Desperately?PW/Q^M[I;PQ\' =U6W0M¼[6W\
When I heard that my Ricky had “come out” as a homosexual, I 
couldn’t believe any media outlet as reputa-ble as TMZ.com would print something so fallacious. Just to clarify for all those celeb-gossip-whores out there: Ricky Martin is not gay. 
Just because a man can dress himself 
and looks damn good shaking his bon bon in a soaking-wet pair of white jeans does not mean he’s gay. 
Take Anderson Cooper. Allegations 
that that silver fox is also gay are equally offensive to my deepest sexual fanta-sies. If Anderson is going to be plowing anyone — it’s not going to be some little Republican fag in a scummy airport bath-room — it’s gonna be me. In fact, I’ve got a feeling he’s gonna write me back any day now — especially since I sent him my leopard-print panties (his fave) in my last care package. 
Anyway, back to my Ricky. Tight pants 
and manicured eyebrows don’t make him gay — they make him a man, and a down-right sexy one at that. Labelling Ricky Martin gay will set a dangerous precedent for all well dressed men out there — Ryan Seacrest, you better watch yourself.
So, to all you scrawny little queers out 
there that want a firm piece of Latin ass: Get a move on. Ricky’s gonna be too busy showin’ me la vida loca to notice your pansy-ass moves.

pillowcase belonging to my great-grandmother (the kindly Katherine Kay Kettleman) slipped onto the concrete.
That’s when we got another 
good idea: We could turn our sleepover into a costume party! My friend said I should be a ghost, because the pillowcase fit nicely over my head. I marveled as my BFF fashioned two eyeholes in the pillowcase. Since I was feeling a little silly by that point, I didn’t remember how spooky ghosts could be.
We decided that since we were 
celebrating Geisel’s special day, he would want to be part of the fun, too. After we put the pillowcase on the statue, we stepped back to admire our hard work. It was so freaky! We nearly skiddadled. (Instead, we put flashlights under our chins and touched ourselves to Twilight until we fell asleep.)
That was Tuesday night. I found 
out about the campuswide scare two days later, and knew imme-diately what I had to do. I felt so ashamed to be associated with such a scary costume. I myself am scared of ghosts, so I understood the pain those people were going through.
As a student who has watched 
“The Others” and “The Haunting, ” I sympathize with students who were mad that a statue had come back from the dead. Making fun of the undead is not funny. It is just plain spooky.

The Tritons, buoyed on by the larg-
est showing of Blue and Gold solidar-ity seen on the UCSD campus since its inception, took on the Matadors in front of one mildly amused fan, amounting to the greatest aggregate weight advantage UCSD support has seen over any visiting fan base in RIMAC Arena history.
UCSD’s solitary fan on the night, 
54-year old self-proclaimed hot-dog enthusiast Frank “The Blob” Blobsac said: “I like the way the dogs feel in my mouth. ”
Blobsac says his affinity for UCSD 
sports stems from a deep seeded appreciation for the hot dogs sold at RIMAC Arena’s concession stand, as much as it is rooted in an appreciation for the teams’ athletic ability.
“The relationship that I have with 
UCSD volleyball is two-fold, and is therefore central to my livelihood. ” Blobsac said. “On one hand, the sau-sages have the most genuine texture on my tongue, unlike any concession stand hot dog in the area. ”
Blobsac’s immersion into Triton 
volleyball fandom was not random, says Dr. Bosibich, Head of the UCSD Department of Spirit Promotion.
“Succulent hot dogs are delec-
table, ” Bosibich said. “Fans love hot dogs, especially when the juice bursts onto their lips — much to their delight. ” 
Blobsac interrupted, while shov-ing three spicy dogs into his mouth.
“Their new sausage policy facili-
tates a greater appreciation for the athletes by offering an improved fan experience, centered around sau-sage consumption, ” Blobsac said. “Through greater adoration of our sausages will spawn a more profound appreciation for our athletes. ”
Bosibich’s hope the concessions 
would draw fans was validated by Blobsac — who also expressed a multi-faceted appreciation for Triton volleyball.
“The way those strapping young 
men brandish their delicately formed forearms and their Spandex con-strained muscularity evoke a visceral, cathartic reaction that simply cannot be ignored, ” Blobsac said.
Bosibich plans to attract a greater, 
loyal following within the surround-ing community — converting fans in much the same fashion that that Blobsac was converted.
However, despite the landmark 
achievement in attendance at a UCSD sporting event, three visiting fans nearly accounted for an aggregate weight close to that amassed by Blobsac — proving the Triton atten-dance advantage was in fact fragile.
In spite of the massive influx of 
fan-power, UCSD was unable to over-come its fundamental and undeniable inferiority as an athletic enterprise. They lost in three straight sets to a dominant Matador team. ;/,),:;;/65.:

Juggs Apaho released yet 
another cliche, chocolate-covered rom-com to throw you and your puppy lover through a rollercoaster of emoticons in the season of .
Come on, Hollywood! 
How many times will we be forced to sit through the same old cliche? Once again, Michael Cera is the lovable nerd who meets the 1,000-year-old hot vampire chick, while his token black best friend unites the racist underdog football team just in time to clench the title and local mall cop/tormented Iraq veteran next door saves the world from consumer-trigggered apocalypse during a high-speed chase with alien zombies through the city, and, of course, everyone lives happily ever after. Typical. 
Though gospel narration 
by the predictably chosen Morgan Freeman adds a certain level of sophistica-tion to the otherwise juvenile tribute to 1920s simplicity, Apaho slaps his egotistical actors in the face with lim-ited onscreen time due to a 20-minute Michael Jackson montage an hour into the drama. M. Night Shyamalan steals the show, however, as a lowly meter maid whose single haunting line will reso-nate long after the end cred-its: “I see stupid people. ”
With 9/11 as the same-ole 
backdrop, one-dimensional characters that are little more than pretty faces, Michael Baysplosions, twins who swap identities, a neighborly MILF who sunbathes in the nude, an ex-convict who will dance his way out of the ghetto, Tim Burton-inspired psychedelic cinematography and token midget and Meryl Streep as a middle-aged beauty on the inside, this weekend will surely get the consumer-tween thumbs-up and a thoughtful Roger Ebert nod. But honestly, what else can that man do at this point?

When your daugh-ter asks to listen to the latest 
album on the gramo-phone, be forewarned: A sinister, mop-topped foursome will be haunt-ing your study this evening. Loose-Legs Lennon and his cronies have returned to soil our 
British shores with Sgt. 
Pepper’s Lonely Hearts 
Club Band , and the very 
foundations of Christian civilization are at risk.
This time, the so-
called “Beatles” coun-terfeit themselves as the equally fictional Sgt. Pepper and his band, 
beguiling the innocent 
listener through a simu-lated concert. “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds” so revels in their counter-culture that it unfolds through a ring-ing guitar, throbbing and humming almost as if it were about to morph into the most dangerous and blasphe-mous of instruments: the xylophone.
Of course, the blight-
ers offer more hosannas 
to the haze of opiates: 
The tender, harp-driven verses of “She’s Leaving Home” are seductive to the weak listener. Men of Britain, be not derailed, for your wives will be weak-kneed with the Fab Four’s sloppy, satanic sex hair.
Reject the album as you would a Red Chinaman, for both are asking for your daughter’s hand. No good can come of a band who cackles over 
the plight of bereft 
seniors, as the Beatles often do in the sinis-ter and agist  “When I’m Sixty-Four. ” Mark my words: Those who don’t act with a firm hand will live to see their very own grand-children smoking the

to this filth. Confirm your children’s souls to Jesus before they join the Mohammedans in the fire.

4MVVWV;ML]KM[)UMZQKIV[1V\W4QNMWN;QVMy World is the kind of album where you can sing the 
whole thing without even listening to it, because you’ve heard it so many times you just know it by heart. Sometimes it makes you feel that you are  Justin 
Bieber. Or, even better, that you are inside  Justin 
Bieber. Now that is what I call living.
The first song is 
“Baby, ” which everyone loves and watches on Y ouTube. This makes me very angry because I don’t think they know Justin like I do.
He often visits my 
thoughts at night. When I’m lying in my bed, I look up at the stars flying around in the great-big universe like little fire-flies, and I just drift off to the luscious squeals of “Eenie meenie miney mo lova” while I imagine how life will be when Justin and I are together.
This one time, in 
my dreams, we were all laughing and just goof-ing off in a fun bowling alley. We did brown-per-son dances and frolicked like young lesbians from one lane to the next. Even Drake was there. Justin dipped his sweet little fingers into the tight holes in his special JB bowling ball and lunged his ball forth until he had emptied his entire lane. It made me so proud.
The other songs 
on My World are even 
more special because Justin wrote them espe-cially for me. (Though I secretly preferred the bathroom Y ouTube vid-eos to this new album, because it was a lot more intimate, just me and Justin. We actually would make really fast friends. Justin likes video games, and I like video games; would talk about girls with good-smelling hair and maybe I could put some Ambien in his juicebox and give him noogies like he does with Luda. And when it comes time for his castrata ceremony, I’ll be there to clean up the aftermath.ALBUMREVIEWS

After years of debate and back-
and-forth controversy, UCSD finally 
has its football team. While original pushes for an intercollegiate Triton football team focused on creating a men’s team, the recently approved initiative sponsored by the Associated Students and funded by the UCSD Athletic Department will create a much sexier alternative: a powderpuff lingerie football team.
The team, which is slated for its 
inaugural season in the fall of 2011, will be made exclusively of female stu-dent athletes who possess the physical talents and attributes necessary to compete at the highest level of col-legiate lingerie football. Adhering to the bylaws of the American Lingerie Football Association (ALFA), the UCSD team will follow the same rules of flag football and mandate the wearing of a wide arrange of blue and gold-themed pieces of lingerie.
AS President Utsav Gupta, who 
has been one of UCSD football’s greatest supporters, views the cre-ation of the lingerie squad as a great step in building school spirit.
“When people think of college, 
they think of two things: football and hot girls, ” Gupta said. “Up until this point UCSD has had neither, so the landmark creation of this lingerie football team will help put UCSD on the map. And with all of the budgetary crises that we are having, t h i s  t e a m  w i l l  b e  a  s p a r k  t o  r e v e n u e  creation through ticket sales, mer-chandising and alumni donations.

PROTESTING  — The UCSD protesting 
team scored a major upset over national powerhouse UC Berkeley yesterday at the annual Haters Hating on Hate Protesting Classic on the Berkeley campus. Relatively 
unknown to the activist world, the upstart 
Tritons claimed a dominating 8-1 victory at the event.  
After orchestrating a series of impressive 
racial protest events four weeks ago, UCSD petitioned the NCAA for recognition as a collegiate squad to compete against the nation’s best activist universities.  With the national attention on the campus after the Compton Cookout, NCAA Director of 
Impotent Athletics Schwanz Fotze said he 
would give UCSD a chance.
With a newly minted  NCAA certifica-
tion and a successful racial protesting cam-paign tucked in their trousers, the Tritons entered the contest believing they could use their beginners luck to make a good show-ing at the tournament. The three-day con-test featured nine events with members of elite protesting groups like PETA, NAACP and ACLU participating as the judging panel.  Teams were evaluated based on the effectiveness of their tactical approach to each event.  
“It’s really important to pace yourself, ” 
the event’s director Dummes Huhn said.  “Y ou’re out there all day with a picket sign, and your arms get really really tired. Y ou have to be mentally prepared for that. ”
Led by Black Student Union members, 
the UCSD protesting team is also comprised of members from Calpirg and UCSD’s Coalition to Save Our Futures. The squad scrimmages anytime there’s an issue around campus, which happens every two to three years. When protesting isn’t in season, the 
team trains by running laps around the 
Chancellor’s Complex and throwing darts at University of California Mark Yudof ’s head. With sign-making and simple slogan cre-ation workshops, the protesting team does its part to teach the ins and outs of the sport.
“We are a group of people who really have 
a passion for this, ” sophomore Arschgeige Horst said.  “Protesting is an art form. It requires a simplification of facts so that you 
can recruit people who could care less and 
grab media attention.  It’s all about inciting an uproar when everyone is oblivious. ” 
Those hoping to make the team next 
year practiced protesting by focusing on a mock issue: the “Banning Socks with Sandals” campaign : a brouhaha over the shenanigans of people trying to keep their toes warm in the winter because it’s the only damn pair of shoes they own.  
Horst, a BSU starlet, earned the Most 
Valuable Protestor honor at the event with stellar performances in the Best Staged Walk-Out event and Best Inspirational Speech event.
“When you really care about an issue 
it makes a big difference in your perfor-mance, ” she said.  “I really care about socks and sandals.  It’s just so disgusting.  I mean, just take your socks off. ”
The Classic featured events like the Most 
Catchy Campaign Slogan, Best Tactical Takeover of Campus Administrator’s Office and Most Ridiculous Demands List. The Tritons claimed victories in all three follow-ing the brilliant “Socks Suck” slogan.  
The Berkeley Bears earned their only 
victory in the Best Reactionary Action by 
the Public as the team incited violent raids 
throughout the Berkeley community to execute all socks-and-Birkenstock wearing fools on campus.  
Despite only congealing into a NCAA 
certified team four weeks ago, the protest-ing team’s early success bodes well for the future.  
With tuition hikes, healthcare and 
underpaid workers’ issues on the horizon, it 
promises to be an opportunistic season for <ZQ\WV

Entering their Feb. 12 sea-
son-defining matchup against 
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation’s No. 1 ranked Cal State Northridge volleyball team, No. 13 UCSD needed a home-court advantage — one that only an inspirational dis-play of Triton pride from the RIMAC Arena crowd could provide.
The reception they would 
receive was nothing short of the greatest spectacle of UCSD spirit in the university’s humble history.
“Tonight more than ever, 
we really needed our home crowd to be our ‘seventh man’” head coach Kevin Ring said. “What we experienced tonight transcends any expectations that anyone in our organization held of the degree to which our home crowd can play a role in our results. This is the kind of atmosphere that any aspiring

To commence the countdown to this 
year’s Sun God Festival on May 14, A.S. Concerts & Events scattered 
bookmarks with the names of five art-ists slated to appear on the main stage across campus earlier this week. Among the names leaked were Drake — who Associate Vice President of Concerts and Events Alex Bramwell confirmed as the event’s head-liner — Michelle Branch, Thrice, Relient K and DJ Z-Trip.
The bookmarks, painted with artist por-
traits bearing the stylized Sun God stamp and a tip to check out http://www.sungodfes-
tival.ucsd.edu  on April 5 for the full lineup, 
appeared early on the morning of March 29, when members of ASCE placed them in 
areas such as Mandeville, Price Center and Library Walk. 
Last year, the festival’s line-
up was revealed over mega-phone at the annual Battle of the Bands. 
“Traditionally, announcing 
the lineup at Battle of the Bands has been anti-climactic and awkward, ” Bramwell said. “This year, we wanted to do some-thing new and fun, so we did a soft release of some of the bigger acts. We wanted people to find the artists on their own — get people talking to their friends and building the buzz. ”
The unusual nature of the release left 
some students unsure if the musicians were officially confirmed for the festival.
“I thought they were just rumors, ” Muir 
College senior Rebecca Holland said. “I kept hearing about Michelle Branch and Drake and seeing people update their sta-tuses on Facebook, but I didn’t know if they were actually coming. ”
Other students thought the partial 
release of the lineup was a mistake made by A.S. Concerts & Events.

The cost of on-campus dorms and dining will 
likely increase beginning Fall Quarter 2010.
A proposed department budget, finalized by the 
on-campus Housing, Dining and Hospitality Services Board earlier this month, now awaits approval by Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny Rue. The plan would increase dining plans by $98 a year for students in the residence halls, and $75 for those in on-campus apartments. 
Housing fees would increase by $279 a year for 
students living in single or double rooms in the residence halls, and $247 for those in triple rooms. In the apartments, single- and double-room occupants would see a $287 increase, and students in triple rooms would pay $237 more.
The committee, which passed the budget on March 
12, is comprised of nine students representing each of the six colleges, student staff, the Inter-Collegiate Residents Association and the A.S. Council, as well as six administrative representatives from HDS, the Financial Aid Office, and the Residential Life Office. Voting members passed the budget 10-1, with one member abstaining and A.S. Campuswide Senator Wafa Ben Hassine casting the sole dissenting vote.
Those in favor of the proposal said the increases 
are necessary to maintain current dining services and food prices.
“The [increased] fees are [needed] because of the 
input gap that has been going up in general, ” ICRA representative Michael Lam said. “Food, utilities and other costs are going up — such as water for all of San Diego. ”

An internal e-mail mistak-
enly leaked by the director of International House has received criticism from students who allege that the I-House administrators illegally use criteria such as race and citizenship in their admis-sions process. 
On March 4, I-House Director 
Christi Gilhoi sent an e-mail  to 
the entire I-House listserv with the subject line “Confidential — I-House Selection List. ”  The e-mail 
contained a spreadsheet with the personal information of 148 stu-dents who had applied to I-House in Fall Quarter 2009, including columns for factors such as “citi-zenship” and “cultural identity. ” A followup e-mail from Gilhoi 
asked recipients to permanently delete the e-mail without reading its contents, but the information was quickly circulated. 
Elizabeth*, an Eleanor 
Roosevelt College junior who wished to remain anonymous, 
said the e-mail reveals a flawed 
admissions system in which citi-zenship and ethnicity are deciding factors.

The soul of student life at UC San Diego

remains the same, significant cuts 
in services will follow, including the possible shut down of  OceanView Terrace — which has the highest operational costs and the largest stu-dent workforce of any dining hall at UCSD. In the event of OVT’s closure, adult staff would move to other on-campus venues, but students would h a v e  t o  r e a p p l y  t o  w o r k  a t  a n o t h e r  dining hall. 
Eleanor Roosevelt College com-
mittee representative Daniella Shulman said the decision to endorse a fee increase came after much delib-eration on the subject.
“I want to stress that the commit-
tee has been working for an entire quarter on this to make the budget, ” Shulman said. “In comparison to every other UC, I believe San Diego has the lowest housing costs. ”
UCSD has the third cheapest 
housing in the system, with UC Merced and UC Riverside being the most affordable with respect to on-campus residence halls.
Director of Housing, Dining 
and Hospitality Services Mark Cunningham said an increase in mandatory dining dollars would help pay for the reopening of Sierra Summit, the John Muir College din-ing hall currently undergoing reno-vations. He added that bump in fees would not be accompanied by any increase in food prices, and that the current level of services would continue.
According to a 2010-11 budget 
released by the board, HDS is try-ing to cover an expected decrease in total income of over $2,300,000, as well as an increase in expenses of over $1,120,000. Given that 33 per-cent of undergraduates live in on-campus housing, implementing this increase will raise at least $2,550,000 to cover those costs. In addition to the funds generated by the pro-posed dining dollar and housing fee increase, HDS will be enact-ing minor cuts in general service expenses — such as groundskeeping, buses, conferences, and post-office services — and large cuts in service 
improvement and development.
At a hour and a half long public-
input period proceeding the board’s vote, students asked the committee to reject dining-dollar and housing fee increases, saying they were an unnecessary burden on freshmen and sophomores.
“Housing and Dining knows that 
students are unaware, and they keep on raising fees when they might not even be necessary  and taking advan-
tage of a lack of concern, ” Revelle College Resident Adviser Chiang Jui Y oung said. “[Students] might not care personally because their parents are paying their fees. ”
Ben Hassine said she voted 
against the extra dining dollars due to her concern that students fees are already rising so steadily.
“It’s essentially going to make our 
school less acceptable than it already is, ” Ben Hassine said. “We already have 35-percent tuition increases, and to keep raising prices is danger-ous, especially to students. ”
Campuswide Senator Desiree 
Prevo said she felt students on the committee were unaware of how increased fees would negatively affect students and campus acces-sibility.
“Being someone that tries to get 
students to come here, especially from low-income backgrounds, it’s really hard to say, ‘Come here, but I’m not sure if you can afford it. ’” Prevo said. “It puts me in a really difficult position. ”

ZZZIDIVDHGJRY0$<At the first A.S. council meet-
ing of Spring Quarter, coun-cilmembers had little to talk 
about, yet managed to drag out their discussion and debate for over four hours.
Warren Senator Alyssa Wing 
announced the lineup for next Friday’s Warren Live concert – Delta Spirit, Junior Boys and Pop Noir.
Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox arrived to present key points from last week’s UC Board of Regents meeting at UC San Francisco. 
Fox updated councilmembers 
on the administration’s intent to define common goals and actions to improve the campus climate by enhancing diversity with admissions and retention.
Future plans include expand-
ing opportunities for students to participate in cross-cultural events, identifying appropriate areas of campus for art displays representa-tive of minority communities and creating resource centers for African American students. 
Associate Vice President of 
Concerts & Events  Alex Bramwell  dis-
cussed how his department books art-ists for the Sun God Festival each year. 
This year, the coveted festival 
wristbands will be distributed on both the Thursday before and the Friday of the festival. More details and the official line-up in its full glory will be revealed Monday, April 5 on the festival Web site.
Revelle Senator Arvind 
Satyanarayan  brought his senator 
project – a glossy banner with facts about Revelle – to the council meeting. 
The biggest talk of the night came 
when VP of Finance and Resources Peter Benesch gave an update on the 
state of the A.S. budget. 
Recently, the funding originally 
allocated for media organizations was spent. With new student media outlet — such as No. 15 Magazine — councilmembers debated over whether the money would come from Mandate Reserves, which is money typically saved for traditional 
or long-term larg-er events or from money set aside for regular stu-dent organization programming. 
“It isn’t about 
punishing new 
or old orgs, we’ve already overallo-cated our whole budget by $100,000, which is OK, but we established our priorities in the beginning of the year and we should stick to that, ” Benesch said.
After a good hour of debate, 
$8,693.48 was allocated for No. 15 magazine from media orgs unal-located. 
Members from the freshman 
council came to present their accom-plishments from the last two quar-ters, and said an emotional goodbye. 
Items from the finance commit-
tee and the campus affairs commit-tee passed through council quickly and painlessly. 
AVP Enterprise Operations Rishi 
Ghosh proposed a resolution urg-ing the listing of non-bookstore class materials on Tritonlink and other campus systems as a way to improve the academic experience for students. 
Talk later returned to the 
Mandate Reserve money during new business. Campuswide Senator Carli Thomas, said, “We’ve had a strong precedent of not passing mandate reserves. We relocate all this money — this happens every year. ” +W]VKQT,Q[K][[M[4IKSWN

Businessidiot accidentally left the flyers out-
side, ” Marshall College senior Denice Praxidio said.
Plans for a similar viral campaign 
were discussed for the festival last year, but fell through due to design and printer delays. 
According to Bramwell, almost all 
the other acts performing at Sun God are booked. He said the April 5 release of the festival’s full lineup will include other details about the event, includ-ing the layout of the event on RIMAC Field and the other three artists per-forming on the main stage.
“Hopefully, if everything goes 
as planned, we’ll have some ban-ners around campus [on Monday], ” Bramwell said. “We’re going to have a Web site launch; the Sun God Web site will be completely updated, and we’ll have a Facebook event circulating. ”
In the past, A.S. Concerts & Events 
switched off between hip-hop and rock headliners from year to year. The deci-sion to book Drake as the headliner following the 2009 headlining perfor-mance from hip-hop band N.E.R.D. represents a change in priorities for the 2010 festival.
“We generally flip-flop between 
rock and hip-hop, although that is not necessarily how it always has been, ” Bramwell said. “We didn’t feel like we should settle for a less popular rock act if a better hip-hop act was avail-able. I think Drake’s a cool headliner. He’s at his peak right now as an up and coming artist. He’s more relevant than some of the previous headliners we’ve had. ”
Praxidio was enthusiastic about 
the lineup. *WWSQVO,ZISMI

Flops to the A.S. Council for promising the Grove Cafe would 
accept dining dollars when its health inspection grade was 
in fact too low for the dining department’s standards. Props to Bill O’Reilly for offering to pay $16,500 in legal 
fees for the father of a deceased marine, who sued the Westboro Baptist Church after it picketed his son’s funeral. “The idea of Sun God isn’t to 
aim for danceable music.”

A.S. AVP CONCERTS & EVENTSOUT OF CONTEXT
Sometime in late June of the 
year 2044, a thirty-one year old blogger named David Sullivan 
stares intently at a computer screen in a quiet corner of his damp basement apartment. 
He shifts slightly in his second-
hand IKEA armchair, grunting as he reaches for a torn bag of Cool Ranch Doritos. Digging aggressively into the greasy crumbs with one hand, he carefully scrolls through a collection 
of thumbnail photographs with the 
other, his eyes darting rapidly back and forth over chaotic images of an early twenty-first century college house party. In one shot a group of girls grope one another suggestively, each of them clutching a 40-ounce bottle of malt liquor. In another a crowd of red-faced students stand around a battered keg, watching eagerly as two young men chug deep-ly from red plastic cups, racing each other at breakneck speed to the brink of black-out oblivion. 
Sullivan stops suddenly on a dimly 
lit image of chubby male student swig-ging cheap vodka from a plastic bottle. The next shot is the same student, now in mid-fall, his glazed eyes wide with surprise, the bottle abandoned on the ground at his side. Two thumb-nails later the chubby kid is back on his feet and grinding up against one of the malt liquor girls, his pale face frozen in drunken ecstasy. 
“Gotcha, ” Sullivan whispers, 
glancing over at his television. The chubby kid, now thirty years older, stares back from a podium ringed with American flags, his arms wav-ing aggressively as he delivers an impassioned speech about the fiscal woes of the middle-class auto worker. He is Thomas Miller, junior senator from California and the Independent nominee for president of the United States. Tomorrow, when Sullivan posts the damning photographs on his popular blog, Miller — who has billed himself as a squeaky clean political outsider — will face a media hellstorm. He will lose his nomina-tion, drop out of the race and retire begrudgingly to the fleeting shadows of defamed anonymity. He will be temporarily ruined and permanently frowned upon. He will rue the day he let his roommate post those damn photos on Facebook.
Of course, that’s just a hypo-
thetical situation. The question is how soon it will be a reality. With the sheer amount of unfiltered informa-tion that our young generation feeds so willingly to the vast social landfill 
of the Internet, it’s entirely conceiv-
able to imagine a day when every political candidate, every high-pow-ered CEO, every teacher, parent and community leader is subject to the unforeseen embarrassment of some long-forgotten Facebook snapshot. Whether depicting casual drug use or the whiskey-driven exposure of one’s cleavage, many of our wildest college 
experiences are now etched perma-
nently into the flame-retardant fabric of the World Wide Web. 
Untag all you want. The Internet 
is a cruel, unforgiving mistress and she’s gonna haunt you with one hell of a vengeance. REZA FARAZMAND

Things have been pretty mellow 
around here this week.
Maybe our minds are too 
fried from finals adderall abuse or spring break binge-drinks to remem-ber anything. Maybe all this La Jolla sunshine is distracting us. Whatever the case, it’s safe to say most have forgotten the racial tension and free-speech debates that plagued the cam-pus last quarter.
That is, at least all those who 
didn’t notice the tension until their paths were blocked from Rubio’s to Center Hall by a deafening “Real pain, real action!” 
Now that Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox has agreed to meet the Black Student Union’s list of demands and the local news channels have cleared Library Walk, efforts to create a more tolerant campus community have moved indoors. In particular, walkouts and picket signs have been replaced with an effort to pass statewide legisla-tion that would ban hate speech.
A.S. Vice President External 
Affairs Gracelynne West and BSU co-chairs David Ritcherson and Fnann Keflezighi are currently working with the UC Student Association to imple-ment a law that would make slur-lov-ing publications like the Koala  illegal.
Downright unconstitutional, if you 
ask us. A lot of other people think so too. But that’s an issue that — if chal-lenged in court — will soon be hashed out with lawyers. The real problem with California Law AB 412 is that, in attempting to protect those who are hurt by racist remarks, would end up regulating individual thought.
Of course, most would rather 
poke fun at such legislation than care about what’s behind it: a group of stu-dents who feel ostracized when they hear their peers throwing around racial slurs with such causal callous-ness. But even if an umbrella policy swooped in and forced every hurtful word out of public discussion, the ignorance would remain.
Any policy which forces tolerance 
would most likely polarize the com-munity further. Just think how deter-mined Koala members were to release 
a sufficiently offensive issue once A.S. President Utsav Gupta slapped their paws and froze their funding. When a group of students feels their right to free speech is being threatened, they will come out in full force — focusing on their right to say something rather than how it might affect someone liv-ing a different experience.
That’s why we feel student leaders 
shouldn’t waste their time with broad legislation that trickles from the top down and gives even more power to administrators. Instead, they should focus on enlightening a student body that’s still got a lot to learn about the system. Along with pumping up outreach efforts and maintain-ing retention programs for minority students, why not plan campuswide campaigns that invite students to learn more about where organizations like MEChA and the BSU are com-ing from? Education cannot stop at a few impassioned rallies — we need to engage in an active dialogue about why hate speech is hurtful.
At the very least, the authors of the 
bill could focus on writing a strictly on-campus policy. They might not be able to eliminate hate speech or con-vince a group of righteous bigots that their public charade is a detriment to our community, but they could at least push for localized penalization where possible.
The Sun God Festival may have earned itself an unofficial slo-gan this year: last name “ever, ” 
first name “lamest. ” 
We’re not referring solely to the 
just-leaked lineup — we’re talking about the new viral bookmark cam-paign to “get people talking” about 
everyone’s favorite day of the year. But 
the event’s lackluster slips of expensive paper and weak musical lineup are not promising signs, to say the least.
Viral marketing, when done 
right, is effective — everyone gets borderline obsessive over finding the next clue in a mysterious grassroots campaign, and pretty soon you have a fan-base frenzy of Dark Knight pro-
portions. The whole point is to build anticipation, and to make us want to know more — which is exactly why 
dropping the headliners’ names with 
absolutely no lead-ing is one big fat letdown.
That’s not to say that A.S. Concerts 
& Events hasn’t succeeded in the game of pre-Sun God buzz in past years. Former A.S. Vice President of Concerts & Events Garrett Berg’s Baby Sun God search left cryptic clues on 
Twitter of where to look for the little 
guys, offering prizes to anybody who happened upon one while crossing the eucalyptus grove. Campaigns like that get you 500 followers and a cam-pus full of students frantically check-ing their cell phones for the next A.S. message. Imagine that. 
Dropping a few bookmarks on a 
bench, however, completely ignores the surefire rules of playing 
hard to get. 
There’s nothing to decode and no need to devote any thought to figuring out what’s going on aside from try-
ing to remember 
the lyrics to that other Drake song. 
In short: Y ou really fucked 
this one up, ASCE. 
At least in the past the final 
announcement arrived with a little fanfare, over a loud-speaker at the Battle of the Bands to a huge crowd. This time, says AVP of 
Concerts and Events Alex Bramwell, 
the news will just be added to the 
Sun God Web site.
Loud things through mega-
phones offer students an opportu-
nity to cheer. UCSD doesn’t get 
a whole lot of chances to lose its 
marbles, and the latest replace-
ment of one of those moments 
with an anti-climactic 
bookmark is a worry-ing sign of the weeks 
to come.
At the very least, 
ASCE could have saved 
the headliner for the big :PTVUL>PSZVU

As the new quarter begins, we 
ask that all students, staff, faculty and 
especially administrators reflect on the events that shook UCSD at the end of February. We do so not in order to dredge up unpleasant memories but to focus the campus on the road ahead: one that hopefully will lead to a more inclusive campus that reflects all of California’s communities.
If you are among those who still 
are not aware that something impor-tant happened in February, we urge you to ask your fellow students, work-ers or colleagues for their understand-ing of what took place. We have met some professors, for example, who truly knew nothing about the “cook-out, ” the noose, the other racist inci-dents or even the rallies and protests. It would behoove them to look at the online video of the protests and listen to the students. It would be good for them to learn what is happening out-side their office or lab.
If you are among those who heard 
about the incidents and responded with, “It doesn’t affect me so I don’t really care, ” we ask that you look beyond your own career or studies. UCSD often seems to be in a pro-tected bubble far away from the messy reality of history, but racism, anti-immigrant sentiments and the dis-mantling of public higher education are on the rise throughout the nation — and UCSD is not exempt. 
If you are among those who heard 
about the incidents and reacted by saying, “Y es, the incidents were offen-sive, but the Black Student Union and its allies made too big a deal about it. They overreacted, ” we ask that you take the time to think about why many of your fellow students reacted the way they did. We ask that you Google “noose” and scan images of lynching. We ask that you consider what it would be like to never see another person from your community in class. Perhaps then you will under-stand that the reaction was not exag-gerated, but in fact quite temperate.
More importantly, we ask all 
students, staff, faculty and especially administrators at UCSD to join in the long-term project to make the campus more reflective of California and more hospitable to all communities. We believe Chancellor Marye Anne Fox’s team when it says it is committed to making much needed systemic chang-es in student and faculty demograph-ics, the curriculum and the entire campus environment. With interna-tional attention on UCSD, it is crucial that such changes be implemented before private donors and other fund-ing sources begin to redirect their gifts to other more diverse schools.
The students who protested 
together with their staff and faculty allies were not thinking, “What can we get for ourselves?” but rather, “What can we do to make UCSD a better university for those who come after us?” We hope you will support them in their ongoing efforts.

e-mail: opinion@ucsdguardian.orgMonday reveal. Giving us a reason 
to hold our breath is the basic rule of announcing anything — that’s why they always save first place for last.
Although every once in a while 
it’s nice to tap into our inner 12-year-olds (I love you, Michelle), it’s hard to shake the feeling that Sun God 2010 is going to be a drastically less awesome version of Sun God 2009, however uncaged the daytime festivi-ties find themselves to be. 
We’ve got DJ Z-Trip serving as 
the Girl Talk emulator — and, like last year’s mashup god, his dance tent party might end up being the ulti-mate draw for this year’s festivities. We have some reservations, though. Z-Trip may have rightfully earned concert cred for fathering the mash-up movement, that doesn’t mean he’s the best around — Girl Talk is his more fluid and infinitely less stodgy grandson, and there are more just like him who have taken what Z-Trip started and run with it. Needless to say, this year’s dance tent may be lacking some essential groove.
Relient K and Thrice are essen-
tially identical as Christian-rock bands, albeit more rollicking ver-sions of last year’s Augustana. Sara Bareilles and Michelle Branch go head to head for “cute female artist with fun pop vibe, ” though the differ-ence here is that Branch is going to capitalize on all the soft spots she hit with girls who still remember the lyr-ics to “Everywhere” in middle school.
There’s one act, however, that’s 
got us worried; the one with the Top-40 hit who is, yes, “a really big name right now, ” but doesn’t exactly have a whole lot to back it up: the one and only Drake. We’re having horrific flashbacks to Sun God 2008, when Sean Kingston flopped onstage and didn’t even finish the one song we came to see him sing. Peruse a couple of live Drake performances online and you’ll see he’s got a knack for shouting over the pretty part of the song, and then cutting it off like a real jerk. 
Still, there are three more unan-
nounced bands coming to the main stage, and Bramwell says there are still some decent-sized names he’s kept under wraps. 
Here’ s to hoping that Monday’ s 
announcement will awaken the so-far gloomy Sun God spirit in all of us.

“I think the lineup is a big step 
up from last year, ” she said. “I think 
this year really has something for everyone. ”
Though the majority of the acts 
are booked by ASCE, the traditional Battle of the Bands —held April 3 at the Loft — will determine the main-stage opener. 
Student bands registered online 
at the Sun God Web site, where other students could vote for their favor-ites. Voting ended March 14 and now the top five bands — Mack’N Biz, Diversion Sound, Seriously, Zephyr Riot and Mad Traffic — will com-pete.
Y et another musical face-off — 
the first ever DJ Battle Dance Party — will take place on April 2 at the 
Loft to determine which student dee-jays will spin under the festival’s dance tent.
“Last year, we had a deal with 
DVC where we gave them blocks of time and they chose the DJs, ” Bramwell said. “We still gave DVC blocks of time early in the afternoon, but we wanted to give the DJs that we felt were the best a spot. ”
A panel of five judges consisting 
of A.S. Concerts & Events interns and staff members will decide both the Battle of the Bands and the DJ Battle Dance Party.
 “It’s a pretty good way for student 
deejays to get an equal chance to perform, ” said, Sixth College senior Justin Park, who will compete as DJ Skyblu. “Even if you might not know the right people, you can have a shot of getting in the lineup. ”

LAUNCH is a program offered by UCSD Extension that enables 
UCSD Undergraduates to obtain a Specialized Certificate in 
one of a variety career fields at a reduced cost to the student.
* excludes Paralegal certificatebackgrounds have to do with whether or not [they] get in, because I know people who are one-eighth of some exotic race will write that because it will give them a better chance of getting in, ” she said. “Students should not have to resort to white little lies to get in. ”
She also said she found the scoring 
system to be arbitrary. When Elizabeth applied last year, she was placed on the wait list but eventually denied accep-tance. Officials informed her she had not scored as high as other candidates, she said. However, according to the spreadsheet, students with much lower scores were accepted. 
“There are people on that list who 
got in with average scores of 13 and13.5 when I got a 16.5 out of 18, ” she said. “They lied to me. ”
Elizabeth said admissions officials 
should take into account achievements on a global level, such as volunteer work and educational experiences abroad, instead of directly considering race.
John*, another student who 
declined to be named,  created the 
e-mail account concerneducsd@yahoo.com to spread the word about the issue 
and the ways in which he believed the I-House Admittance Committee has violated both state and federal laws. 
In an e-mail sent from the account 
to the I-House listserv, John claims the selection process violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964, specifically the Fair Housing Act provision. 
According to the Fair Housing 
Act, it is illegal to base any housing-related transaction based on factors such as race, color, national origin, religion and sex. 
Additionally, Title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimi-nation on the basis of race, color or national origin in programs receiving financial assistance from the federal government.International Group Affairs intern 
Jeremy McGrew — a member of Gilhoi’s staff — said it is outrageous that individuals like John are claiming racial discrimination occurs within an organization with the opposite mission. 
“The whole point of this place is 
to create diversity and make it a blend of everyone from all over the world, ” McGrew said. “How are we supposed to create an International House if we don’t know where the heck you are from? That is the only reason that line exists on the application. ”
According to McGrew, it is optional 
to fill in one’s national origin and cul-tural identity on the application. He defended the I-House Admittance Committee’s system as “fair and dip-lomatic. ”
“ Anyone who is trying to criticize 
the setup of this, or how they run it, is trying to throw a wrench in something that’s moving very smoothly, ” McGrew said. “We have a good setup, and good people, and good intentions. ”
Eleanor Roosevelt College junior 
Pejman Moghbeli, a current I-House resident, said he disagreed with the decision to accept applicants with lower scores than those rejected, but under-stood why the staff would take cultural identity into consideration when facili-tating an international community.
Elizabeth said she remains con-
vinced that the issue extends beyond attempting to create diversity and expects I-House officials to provide a legitimate explanation for the e-mail. 
“Right now, I just want some 
answers, ” she said. “Y ou can’t have any point system based on race and ethnicity. ”
I-House Director Christi Gilhoi was 
unavailable for comment.

Samples, synths, and electronica: if you missed 
STS9 in February, here’s a chance for your penitence. Most of RJD2’s tracks ﬂoat chiming, nod-away rhythms over a galactic, vacant string section, while scrapbook-clipping samples chop in and out. When he dips into singer-songwriter territory, though, RJD2 trades his spaced-out

the ISS — but he brings funky, slow-dance smoothness that’ll have you eyeing the hips swaying next to you. What better cure for the Mondays? (MP)RJD2

your Winter Quarter grades? Look no further than the San Diego Civic Theatre for a pick-me-up that doesn’t require illegal substances. That’s right — your closet-favorite chick ﬂick from 2001 has been adapted to the stage for one Elle of a good time. If a bubbly Reese Witherspoon impersonator doesn’t 
put you in a good mood, the bend and snap, the

Since its release into theaters last 
Friday, Steve Pink’s “Hot Tub Time Machine” has received 
mixed reviews. But whether it be wittily stupid or stupidly witty, what better way to look at a film than through the eyes of the actors. On February 15, 2010, two of the film’s stars — Craig Robinson (Darryl from “The Office”) and Clark Duke (Dale from “Greek”) — went behind the scenes with the Guardian . Get ready for heavy 
drinking, menage a troi-ing and

shooting “Hot Tub Time Machine”? Clark Duke : It was fun, but cold — 
as you would expect with snow.Craig Robinson : Y eah, dur-

The resort looked just like the hotel in “The Shining. ” He even broke all the shit in his room!CD: Hey, we’re in this little bitty town and then someone just kicks your door open while you’re asleep. … I’m not going to lie to you guys, I’ve been drinking a lot.G: If you could go back in time, 
would you change things?CR: Change? Y ou know, I wouldn’t change a thing. Actually, there is one girl I wouldn’t have stopped to talk to …G: How did you look 20 years ago?
CD: My head was the same size. I almost killed my mother at birth. Ha!CR: I had that haircut — It was real high. I majored in music. I was a super freshman, all goofy and stupid.G: Were you guys skiers prior to 
filming?CR: They said, “We need you to ski for the movie. ” And I said, “I’m black. ”CD: All the other guys knew how, but not us.CR: The boots are freaking tight! I kept saying, “No, this is too tight!” My toes were all scrunched. By the third day, I made it down the mountain. It would have made great extra footage!

March 22: I introduced myself 
to a circle of hardcore rockers from bands with names like 
Vivid Sekt and Bog People by telling one of the bassists he looked like “the chillest Norse god of war ever. ”
He looked over with a constipated 
grin. I consider hauling scrawny white ass all the way back to Mira Mesa.
“I think you just made his life, ” 
said another member of the circle.
The day before, a ukulele player 
declared herself to be ambigender, and the show ended as the whole audience sat around a harp, cross-legged like it was story time.
A few months 
before that, I termed Tera Melos’ music “space-thrash, ” and guitar god Nick Reinhart nodded in agree-ment, pedo ’stache and all. 
Welcome to the Che Cafe, the 
schizo home of whatever you want — as long as it’s not normal.
I show up half an hour after 
doors. It’s still a wait until the show 
starts, as the openers are in a constant game of chicken with the audience to see who can show up last — but there’s room on the 
back-room couch to perch and kill some change. Even though I’ll always be an omnivore, the Che’s vegan kitchen can give the blonde guitarist in fishnets and spiked leather some competition: $1 soy ice cream sand-wiches at the shows, and real sugar root beer for the same price.
They’re not preachy about the 
veganism, though. Despite horror stories I’ve heard of non-vegan bands trying to book a show and hitting a brick wall (and despite the Animal Liberation Front ’zines and posters declaring “DESTROY ALL JUDGE

How many artists mob 
the stage with three or eight microphone-
toting homies and nothing interesting to say? But when a super group of musicians who are all on point collaborate, it can be beautiful. Army of the Pharaoh’s crew of East Coast underground MCs — assembled by Jedi Mind Trick’s Vinnie Paz — present a diverse sound but stay connected lyrically, spitting bars on the state of hip-hop and the rise of the underground. Starting out with just a break beat, the piece gets super thick as DC the Midi Alien layers haunting piano and guitar samples, matching the serious tone of the verses. Raw vocal scratches help the artists’ message sink in as the beat rides out.

After the restrained lulls present in their last album, Challengers, The 
New Pornographers try to prove they can come back from the lucrative trough of their bygone pop wave. Neko Case’s joyful vocals, backed by the finely-tuned instrumentation, harmoniously lace up latest single “Crash Y ears” . The pairing of drums and low-toned strings is entrancing at the opening and close of the song. Coupled with jingling bells and infectious whistles, it’s reminiscent of their earlier work, which will have long-time fans in a tizzy. Case and company captivate like a multi-car pileup, but you’ll be swaying with a smile rather than rubber-necking with a grimace.

Scorpions
Sting in the Tail
SONY BMG
After 26 years of ripping off  panties with “Rock Y ou Like A Hurricane, ” Sting 
in the Tail  is the last album 
for German melody-metalists Scorpions. Sting  follows their 
familiar two-step formula of sexed-up, guitar-driven anthems followed by melan-choly power ballads, but this mediocre release won’t earn them an encore.
Opener “Raised on Rock” 
reduces the band to a 4/4 
beat-machine trying for garage-rock brashness, and vocalist Klaus Meine’s trips over himself trying for vocal complexity. Despite attempts at resurrecting bad-boy glory nostalgia, the band never transcends Bon Jovi wanna-sleaze. As for the power bal-lads, well, there’s only so much you can do with lyrics strung together via madlib.
Then the frantic pace of 
“Rock Zone” hits like a tsuna-mi, with a chorus that catches the playing-for-beer rawness that the Scorps have been chasing. Follow that with the distant synths of power ballad “Lorelei, ” and it’s a one-two punch. Even if the switch from guitar verse to stirring chorus is predictable, Meine’s smooth tenor sets the track soaring.
It’s only a flash flood of 
quality, though. The rest of Sting  is crammed with trying-
too-hard lyrics written to fit predictable rhyme schemes. After years of hitting with hurricane force, the Scorpions appear to have fizzled into a bunch of hot air.

She & Him
Volume Two
MERGE RECORDS
Zooey Deschanel’s dodged 
the Hollywood archetype of good-actress, terrible-
singer once again, with the help and hipster street-cred of folkster M. Ward after the duo mastered effortless pop on 2008’s Volume One.
She & Him’s follow-up, 
Volume Two , is a continuation 
of the charming, ‘60s-inspired 
sound the duo perfected on their debut, which proves to be a blessing and a curse. The breezy tunes of this collabora-tion are unabashedly fun, but on repeat they’re a lot less charming. 
Deschanel is mostly to 
blame, as Ward seems content in the shadows, tinkering in the album’s background. In the spotlight, Deschanel’s quaint voice doesn’t have the emo-tional range to create moving music; even her saddest songs are sunny.
The excessive sentimen-
tality and cutesy melodies, idealizing the lifestyles of Californian youth, make for perpetually-adolescent pop. When Zooey has the blues, it’s teenage blues, and you just can’t take high school heart-break all that seriously. It’s all good fun, but both musicians are certainly past the puberty-ridden stages of young love.
That’s not to say the album 
doesn’t offer the perfect soundtrack to a California summer. M. Ward’s country-tinged guitar and Deschanel’s saccharine croon prove to be an endearing, albeit tired combination. Nonetheless, the album still exudes the expect-ed twinkly charm.

if Matt Damon didn’t 
know how to act.
To make things worse, 
the first 15 minutes of the film are comprised of foreshadow overkill. Without a booming intro or scrolling text to set the scene, we find ourselves wondering why these stu-pid 3-D glasses are rest-ing on our noses at all. 
Fortunately, the next 
hour provides a signifi-cant degree of relief. Who knows what director Louis Leterrier (“The Incredible Hulk”) started smoking, but the story of Perseus — the unwilling demigod who must pre-
vent his uncle Hades from destroying the human race and conquering the world — is surprisingly captivating. It sounds like the plot to a half-baked children’s movie, but “Titans” is actually quite enthralling, and not in the horrific train-wreck way you might expect.
How it remains 
appealing until the end credits is the great mys-tery. After all, it’s a “Lord of the Rings” quest set in the location of “Troy, ” with a villain who looks like Voldemort’s twin and Liam Neeson as Zeus. But for some reason, all those contrary elements come together to make a piece-meal film that reflects the better qualities in its inspirations.
Look out for one 
hilarious “ Avatar” parallel after another, as Perseus rides Pegasus in a scene that raises the question of why Worthington is so good at mounting winged fictional creatures. But there’s just enough myth in “Titans” to create its own unique story with a touch of campy action, which is all we need to sit back and enjoy. 
That’s not to say the 
film is without fault. Sticklers for Greek mythology will find dis-crepancies in the myths; for example, the character Io claims a god made her immortal as a punish-ment, when she should have turned into a cow. However, it’s not hard to see why Gemma Arterton would have had problems emoting from the CGI form of a talking quad-ruped, so that one can be overlooked for the sake of the story. 
Of course, the major 
blockbuster contains more than its share of cheese, as lines like “Release the Kraken!” and “Tame your storm!” are delivered in the utmost seriousness — making for the best mindless fun since the crotch shot in “LOTR. ”
The film’s only serious 
flaw is that it’ s not wor-thy of 3-D. There are no overly exciting graphics  
(nor any obnoxious ones, for that matter). But if you’ve got itch for ancient Greece, this one’s pure gold; just take my advice and save yourself the $3 extra — who wants to be a four-eyed loser for no good reason?
— DESTROY ALL POLITICIAN”), the Che never gets preachy, even when one of the volunteers brings a bag of Cheetos to the weekly meeting.
It’s hippie heaven, punk paradise, and 
vegan nirvana — and it’s open to anyone.
It’s just that no one thinks to go there.OK, that’s a purposely melodramatic 
statement — the turnout is jumpier than 1938 Poland, but the Che has enough big nights so that core volunteer Gregory Prout is confident that it’ll be financially stable next year, despite the theft of ten grand in sound equipment last summer.
For most UCSD students, though, 
that melodrama might as well be true. Ask what they think of the Che, and you’ll get responses like that of grad stu-dent Y ana Morgulis.
“It looks interesting, ” Morgulis said. 
“I’ d go there if something was happen-ing, but I thought it was boarded up. ”
For reference, the Che was closed for 
two months because of insurance snafus back in Winter Quarter 2009.
Y ou’ d think the Che’s volunteers 
never thought of posting flyers in the Muir College quad. But there is, in fact, outreach going on — just on a small scale. Marshall College senior and core volunteer Alice Nash will be tabling at Admit Day next Saturday, trying to get some pre-frosh blood back into the Che.
There’s even some who choose to 
reach out to the Che. Jerry Chai, Revelle College sophomore and member of the Deejays and Vinylphiles Club, is hoping to organize a dance party at the Che and said the collective’s volunteers have been open to the idea. The DVC draws about 25 times the Che’s capacity to Let’s Bounce every year, and if the sold-out success of the Non-Sexist Dances is any indication, the Che should probably expect the fire marshal to drop by. 
With any luck, some UCSD students 
will make a habit of doing the same.

Revellution
The birth of Revellution — Revelle’s first-ever music festival — has been decidedly under 
the radar. So under the radar, in fact, that most people don’t know it exists.  Add a rapidly 
approaching April 1 concert date, and one begins to speculate that Revellution may just be a grand, misguided hoax. However, with a lineup finally released, there is now a bit more evidence that this thing might actually be happening.  Headliners Story of the Y ear and Terrible Things will take the stage on Thursday to prove that maybe — just maybe — Revelle can rage with the best of them.
Perhaps best known for their 2004 breakthrough hit “Until the Day I Die, ” Story of the Y ear is determined to tear out your eardrums come Thursday. Along with openers Quietdrive, the unabashedly screamo five-piece demonstrates the festival organizers’ apparent goal to create UCSD’s very own mini Warped Tour. Story of the Y ear’s raucous lyrics and heavy break-downs call for more fist-pumping than dancing, but that’s not to say the band strays from melody. As their explosive choruses surely prove, the guys have always had an ear for pop. Expect boisterous sing-alongs and pushy crowds at the this installment of the band’s notoriously energetic live performance record. They will most likely spotlight tracks from their February release The Constant — another loud, angry disc in 
the band’s nearly one-note repertoire."9 !2)%,,% 3!,,!) s 34!&& 72)4%2
Terrible 
Things
Terrible Things is a hodge-podge crew of W arped T our veterans featuring Fred Mascherino (ex-Taking Back Sunday, The Color Fred), Andy Jackson (Hot Rod Circuit), Steve Lucarelli (ex-Once Nothing) and Josh Eppard (ex-Coheed And Cambria). The group doesn’t stray too far from the decid-edly pop-punk and/or sounds produced by their previous bands, but don’t pee yourself waiting eagerly for any Taking Back Sunday wails or Coheed and Cambria prog solos; no, these guys keep it simple. It’s all catchy choruses, three-chord guitar and deeply emo-tional vocals that make you tear up a little bit when things get deep. The band manages to sound like a combination of the Foo Fighters prototypical modern rock and the tradi-tional emo of Sunny Day Real Estate. With an unexpected spring release date for their debut LP , look forward to the band throwing down some new head-bobbers at the show.

2) American League Central
No AL Central team has made it 
to the World Series since the White 
Sox won it all in 2005, and I don’t think that’s about to change this season. Each of the five teams has something great going for it, but not one has enough to push it over the top.
The Twins signed local hero and 
catcher Joe Mauer to a staggering eight-year, $184-million contract extension, but are hurt by the loss of All-Star closer Joe Nathan to sea-son-ending Tommy John surgery on his throwing elbow.
The White Sox have the insane 
brilliance of manager Ozzie Guillen, but cannot win by relying on an outfield of MLB rejects like Alex Rios, Juan Pierre and Andruw Jones. 
The Tigers could make a run 
at the division now that Johnny Damon’s re-grown beard is roam-ing the field, but ace pitcher Justin Verlander’s erratic performance the past few seasons is a big problem.
The Cleveland Indians have 
heartthrob Grady Sizemore roam-ing center field and the young power of firstbaseman Matt LaPorta, but with Jake Westbrook as their Opening Day start-ing pitcher, baseball in October remains a dream for the Tribe.
And except for reigning Cy 
Y oung winner Zach Greinke, the Kansas City Royals have little to offer baseball fans — or their AL competition.My PredictionsDivision champ: Minnesota TwinsIn the hunt: Detroit TigersFantasy sleeper: Max Scherzer, Detroit Tigers starting pitcherStory to follow: Ozzie Guillen’s Twitter account
3) American League East
Following their unparalleled 
27th World Series championship, 
the New Y ork Y ankees somehow managed to shed payroll while improving their team. Gone are Johnny Damon and Hideki Matsui (and their bulging contracts), and here to stay are outfielders Curtis Granderson and Randy Winn, infielder/DH Nick Johnson and starting pitcher Javier Vazquez.
Y ankees general manager Brian 
Cashman should be credited for overseeing an offseason that has turned the defending champs into a more streamlined club — one that now has more bench depth and cost efficiency. No matter how good A-Rod might be, I will always hate baseball’s richest and cockiest player. Mark Teixeira and CC Sabathia, on the other hand, seem like good guys that play hard and stay humble, so I guess not all members of the Evil Empire have fully crossed over to the dark side.Last season’s AL Wild Card 
winners, the Boston Red Sox, roll in from spring training after land-ing the offseason’s top pitching free agent, John Lackey. Boston will hope this makes up for losing their the top offensive free agent of 2009 in left fielder Jason Bay. A pitching lineup of Lackey, Jon Lester, Josh Beckett and Dice-K is dangerous any day of the week, and with Jonathan Papelbon closing out games, the boys from Beantown are looking solid. 
Only a few years removed from 
the dredges of professional baseball, the Tampa Bay Rays have quickly built themselves into a competitive organization. Their early season success will determine whether or not their two star players — out-fielder B.J. Upton and first baseman Carlos Pena — will be signed to contract extensions or traded off at July’s trading deadline.
Look for young pitching phe-
nom David Price to have a breakout season and cement himself as one of the premier left-handed pitchers in baseball.My predictionsDivision champ: New Y ork Y ankeesIn the hunt: Boston Red SoxFantasy sleeper: Brian Matusz, Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher (and University of San Diego alum) Story to follow: How many games will Kate Hudson show up to at Y ankee Stadium to root for her squeeze, Alex Rodriguez?
Thus concludes this year’s edi-
tion of my MLB preseason predic-tions. So tune in this Sunday for Opening Day 2010, pour yourself a frosty beverage and practice your bleacher-bum taunts, because we have 162 glorious games ahead of us.
Oh, and just in case you 
weren’t quite sure yet, I think Alex Rodriguez is a douche.
12-3 victory to seal the series sweep. Senior first baseman Brandon Gregorich went three-for-four with two doubles, two runs and two runs batted in (RBI), while junior sec-ond basemen Blake Tagmyer added three RBIs and two runs. They con-tinued to eat up Seawolves pitching until the ninth inning.
Sonoma dropped to 9-13, 2-10 in 
CCAA play.
Prior to the series against Cal 
Poly Pomona, UCSD hosted Cal State San Marcos in a non confer-ence game on March 22, coming out on top 8-4.
Junior catcher Kellen Lee deliv-
ered a three-hit game, including a home run and three RBIs. The Tritons sent out nine different pitch-ers in the game to keep their arms fresh for league play.
In a home-and-home series — in 
which each team plays host for two of four series games — the Tritons swept Cal Poly Pomona in back-to-back matchups in Pomona on March 25 and March 26.
The Tritons then won both 
games in a doubleheader at Triton Ballpark on March 27 to complete the four-game sweep.
Shibuya dominated off the 
mound once again for the Tritons in 
game one, coasting through seven 
innings conceding just one earned 
run.
Kehoe provided three RBIs and 
senior shortstop Vance Albitz added three hits, allowing UCSD to ease into a 7-3 win. 
Rossman pitched all nine innings 
to go the distance in game two, allowing two unearned runs on five 
hits.
The complete game effort was 
just enough for a 5-2 victory –one 
that Rossman said was mentally and physically taxing.
“We talk about the mental game 
a lot, and it’s something we take pride in, ” Rossman said. “The aver-age fan doesn’t realize how mental baseball is, and the average team doesn’t spend enough time work-ing on it. Physically, it’s exhausting. It was pretty hot in Pomona, and I definitely didn’t cruise through that game. I didn’t have my best stuff, and had to battle my way out of some jams I put myself in. Mentally, I keep telling myself out there, ‘They will not beat me. ’ I hate to lose. ”
Triton Ballpark provided no ref-
uge for Pomona. They were demol-ished 11-0 in game three thanks to a scoreless seven-inning effort out of senior pitcher Kirby St. John and an offensive show by junior second baseman Blake Tagmyer.
Tagmyer opened the game with a 
three-RBI double in the first inning and a three-run home run in the second. His six RBIs and St. John’s impressive pitching was too much for the Broncos to handle, and the Tritons won easily.
The final game in the series was 
highlighted by a gutsy performance from Knudson, who threw over five innings while allowing four hits and two earned runs.
Junior outfielder Kyle Saul was 
one at-bat short of the natural cycle, going 3-3; Kehoe added a home run; and Cal Poly Pomona fell to 17-16 overall and 9-11 in CCAA action.
With their series sweep of Cal 
Poly Pomona, the Tritons surpassed UCSD’s school record of 16 con-secutive wins, pushing their streak to 19 games.
While the No. 1 ranking earned 
the Tritons some respect, Kehoe 
said expectations will only rise.
“The No. 1 ranking is more of 
a recognition thing than anything, ” 
Kehoe said. “The rankings really don’t mean anything besides the fact that we are getting some respect nationally. We know we deserve the No. 1 ranking because we know we are the best team in the country, but it doesn’t change the way we go 
about things at all. We still show up 
every day and outwork everyone 
else in the nation. ”
Kehoe says the team’s success is 
rooted in the players’ work ethic. 
“The mentality we have is that 
we may not have the most talent in the nation, but we have outworked everyone else, ” Kehoe said. “We play teams that we know haven’t worked as hard as we have — and that, in turn, makes us feel we deserve it more. Nineteen straight is a prod-uct of knowing we are better than everyone else, outworking the other team and trusting our preparation — nothing more. ”
Thus far, the season’s success has 
been attributed to consistency in every area of play: the rotation, lineup, bullpen and bench. 
At the top of the rotation, 
Rossman and junior right-hander Tim Shibuya have served as an outstanding 1-2 punch. Rossman now stands 6-0 with a 2.17 Earned Run Average (ERA), while Shibuya stands at 7-0 with a 2.22 ERA.
Junior designated hitter Aaron 
Bauman leads the Triton offense with a .444 batting average and an astonishing .603 on-base percent-age. Gregorich leads the team with an impressive 46 RBI so far this season. 
The Tritons will now set their 
sights on Cal State San Bernadino, working to keep the streak alive in another home-and-home series this weekend. The Coyotes are currently 
16-10 overall and 15-9 in CCAA 
play. 
“No one talks about the fact that 
we have won 19 straight, ” Rossman said. “Sure, we all know it, but the important thing is that we are only focused on the future and getting better. We talk about taking things one game, one inning and one out at a time. That keeps us in the present 
and doesn’t allow us to get caught 
up in external hype that is out of our control. ”

The sophomore cannot seem to stop scoring this season,

Despite my lifelong hatred of 
the American League and its mission to ruin base-
ball via the designated hitter, Alex Rodriguez and the city of Anaheim, I have to admit that sometimes, it’s not so bad. Over the past couple of years, it has produced a quality brand of ball that even we National League-purists can stomach. Teams like the Tampa Bay Rays, the Minnesota Twins and the Texas Rangers are succeeding by relying on young, homegrown talent that cut the big boys in New Y ork and Boston down to size.
So it is with slightly less disdain 
than normal that I give my predic-tions for the 2010 American League baseball season.1) American League West
For the first time in recent 
memory, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (a constant flame to my AL-fueled anger) will not start the season as division favorites. Losing ace pitcher John Lackey to the Red Sox leaves the Halos’ rotation in the hands of the goldie-locked Jered Weaver and Scott Kazmir, who has yet to live up to his Tampa Bay glory days after being traded to Los Angeles last season. The addition of World Series MVP Hideki Matsui at designated hitter to complement Kendry Morales and Torii Hunter will keep their offensive attack scary as ever, but in the AL ’s most exciting division, they just might not be enough. 
The Angels should be espe-
cially wary, considering the Seattle Mariners are baseball’s most improved team after an offseason that saw them add ex-Phillies ace Cliff Lee and ex-Angels leadoff man Chone Figgins to their ranks. With Lee and King Felix Hernandez at the top of the rotation, the Mariners will have the best one-two punch in the league and will thrive off the spacious, pitching-friendly outfield of Safeco Field. If manager Don Wakamatsu and the ageless Ken Griffey Jr. can help newly acquired outfielder Milton Bradley find inner peace, the 2010 Mariners might bring Seattle its first-ever AL pennant. 
Similarly, watching this year’s 
Texas Rangers perform will surely JAKE BLANC

BASEBALL  — Already having amassed 
a school-record 19-game winning streak 
since their Feb. 19 loss to Chico State University, the UCSD baseball team can now add the nation’s No. 1 ranking to its growing list of accolades in 2010.
The Tritons swept their series against 
Cal State Sonoma State University from March 12 to March 14 to earn the No. 1 ranking, then continued to dominate another four-game series against Cal Poly Pomona over spring break between March 25 and March 27. They improved their record to 28-3 overall and 18-2 in California Collegiate Athletic Association play.
But according to senior pitcher Matt 
Rossman, the No. 1 spot and record win streak hasn’t gone to the players’ heads. Rossman emphasized that the team must hold onto its humility throughout the sea-son.
“The No.1 ranking is cool, ” Rossman 
said. “It’s an honor, and we have earned it. Our success and recognition is providing even more motivation for us. We aren’t satisfied with where we’re at, and know that we still have things to improve upon. ”
In a four-game home stand against 
Sonoma State, the Tritons did not leave much room for error. They made easy work of the Seawolves on an effective balance of pitching and offense, earning another four victories to tack to their last 15.
In the opener, junior right-hander Tim 
Shibuya was nearly unhittable, throwing eight innings of two-hit ball. UCSD cruised to a 10-2 win behind Shibuya’s arm, and followed with solid pitching efforts from Rossman and junior right-hander Guido Knudson to take games two and three by scores of 9-7 and 4-3.
Game four of the series saw an offensive 
outburst, as UCSD exploded for 15 hits in a Chart Toppers
The UCSD baseball team earns the No. 1 ranking in Division-II, thanks to a
momentum that senior pitcher Matt Rossman attributes to the team’s “mental game. ”
