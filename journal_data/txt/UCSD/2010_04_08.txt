With the passage of President Barack Obama’s health-care 
reform bill, students at UCSD may soon see the cost of their school-sponsored health insur-ance program increase, along with an excise tax on tanning beds and full insurance sub-sidies for individuals with no income.
The bill  — passed last 
month after more than a year 
of deliberation in Congress — allows students to remain on their parents’ health-insurance plans until they reach the age of 26 — a significant increase from the previously common age limits of 19 or 23. Before the bill’s passage, children were typically removed from their parents’ policies when they graduated from high school or college.
The provision is designed to 
cover the 1.7 million university students — or 20 percent of the national student population — who are currently uninsured. 
According to Student Health 
Insurance Program Manager Cindy McDaniel, allowing stu-dents to stay on their parents’ plan until age 26 will likely raise the price of participating in UCSD’s health-care program.
McDaniel said that if more 
students are covered by their parents’ insurance — students who would otherwise have paid for basic coverage through the campus program — they will choose to opt out of S.H.I.P . Since the price of the S.H.I.P . plan depends on the number of students subscribed to the plan, an increase in students choos-ing to opt may lead to higher prices overall.
Currently, S.H.I.P . costs 
approximately $282 per quarter for undergraduates.  According to McDaniel, it is still too early to estimate how much the pric-es would increase. 
“ A lot of factors go into 
the cost of student health-care plans, ” she said. “Of course, the number of students enrolled will have an impact. It’s still too early to tell... but we’re still trying to work out a time frame [to determine the new rates] with our broker and insurance carrier. ”
For Eleanor Roosevelt 
College freshman Danny Fishman, the reform means he will likely opt out of the pro-gram by next fall. Fishman said that, had the bill not passed, he would have been removed from his father’s insurance plan when he turned 19, and would have subsequently signed up for S.H.I.P . However, his plans have changed.
“If the price of S.H.I.P . 
increases while I’m still on my father’s plan, I’m going to stay on my father’s plan — there’s no need for me to get S.H.I.P . anymore, ” he said. 
The reform is particu-
larly beneficial to students like Fishman who have undergone a medical procedure in the past. Fishman would have had a dif-
Federal health-care reform could mean 
higher rates for students with UCSD health insurance.

An in-the-works proposal to bring the 
San Diego trolley system to UCSD has 
narrowed down three possible routes, and could be completed by 2016, according to 
Director of UCSD Physical and Community 
Planning Brad Werdick. 
The prospect first arose in 2004 when 
San Diego’s Regional Planning Agency sug-
gested extending the current trolley sys-tem from the Old Town Transit Center to the UCSD area, through University Towne Jacobs 
Donation Funds New Hospital
By Connie Qian
Staff Writer
Following a $75 million donation 
from Irwin and Joan Jacobs UCSD 
Health System, which oversees all UCSD hospitals,  has announced plans to build the Jacobs Medical Center, which will take over some responsibili-ties from the UCSD Medical Center in Hillcrest.
Critics from Scripps Medical 
Center in La Jolla argue that the new facility will have adverse effects on the Hillcrest location, which currently offers services such as advanced sur-gery and women’s care to many under-privileged San Diego residents. These services would move to the new center.
“Moving health-care services from 
an underserved community will cre-ate a ripple effect with all providers in the region, ” Scripps Health President and CEO Chris Van Gorder said. “If UCSD provides fewer services in Hillcrest, the other providers   — such as Scripps — will be responsible for a larger share of the underserved com-munities. ”
According to UCSD Health 
System spokeswoman Kimberly Edwards, however, these are not valid concerns. She maintains that the “two-campus strategy” will actually improve patient care in San Diego.
“Surgery and women’s interests 
will be moving [to the Jacobs Medical Center], but everything else stays — trauma, emergency, AIDS/HIV , inpa-tient, outpatient, ” Edwards said. “In fact, bed for bed, we’re going to have more room for people down here. So the complaints that are coming from Scripps are not right at all. ”
According to Edwards, decreas-
ing the number of beds from 321 to 300 is still more than enough to house the average 255 patients in the hospital daily, and removing services will increase the number of private patient rooms.
“The only service leaving Hillcrest 
[completely] is baby delivery, ” Edwards said. “ And that won’t hap-pen for another six years. ”
One of the main focuses of the 
new medical center — which will also house the Hospital for Advanced Surgery and the Hospital for Women and Infants  — will be the Cancer 
Hospital, devoted to addressing the 
needs of patients afflicted with the No. 1 cause of death in San Diego County.

Of the predicted $664 million 
required for completion, the Jacobs 
Medical Center received $350 mil-lion from external sources — such as state bonds, reserves and capitalized leases — and $131 million from char-ity donors. 
“We are extremely pleased to 
support this state-of-the-art medi-cal center, which will provide both outstanding care for patients as well as resources for UC San Diego phy-sicians, researchers and their col-leagues across the La Jolla Mesa to rapidly translate medical research into improved health, ” Irwin Jacobs said in a press release.
Jacobs — who also financed the 
Jacobs School of Engineering — served as a professor of computer science and engineering at UCSD from 1966 to 1972, and founded Fortune 500 company Qualcomm Incorporated in 1985. In 2003, he and his wife donat-ed $110 million to the Jacobs School of Engineering.
“This will be the largest gift 
ever given to UC San Diego Health Sciences, and it is nearly impossible to express the depth of our gratitude, ” Chancellor Marye Anne Fox said in a statement.
The new medical center will cover 
490,000 square feet, and will stand 10 stories high. Construction is set to begin in 2012 and the hospital’s 
doors will be opened for patient care 
in December 2016.

Since then, SANDAG has been 
mapping the area to determine an optimal route for the extension. 
The SANDAG Transportation 
Committee will make an official pre-sentation to the its board of directors on April 16, who will then vote on which routes they would want to pur-sue. During a 30-day scoping period May 3 through June 1, 2010, the public will be able to give feedback on the routes.
The project would extend either 
the trolley or a light-rail transit ser-vice 11 miles north of its starting point at the Old Town Transit Center 
to one of three proposed stations at 
Tecolote Road, Clairemont Drive or Balboa Avenue. 
The extension would run north 
to UCSD along I-5 from Gilman Drive, and then follow Voigt Drive and Genesee Avenue to a final station at UTC. 
Other  alternatives are also  being 
explored. 
According to SANDAG spokes-
woman Anne Steinberger, one pos-sible route from Voigt Drive to UTC is along Regents Road and Executive Drive; another possibility is along Genesee Avenue. 
Stations have also been proposed at University Center Lane, UCSD West, UCSD East, Executive Drive and the UTC Transit Center are all proposed stations.
Werdick said the project has the 
potential to improve public-trans-portation services and reduce traffic congestion. 
“Students, staff and faculty are 
hesitant to take buses — and frankly, a lot of the routes coming to cam-pus are not the most direct routes, ” Werdick said. “The trolley would open up a new alternative transporta-tion method on campus which [is] going to be a lot more attractive. ”
San Diego’s trolley line, called the 
Mid-Coast Corridor Project, was  first suggested in 1987 and then offi-cially created when San Diego voters residents voted in November 2004 to include the initiative in an existing half-cent transportation tax called TransNet. 
“The region has set this as a trans-
portation priority, ” Steinberger said. 
TransNet, implemented in 1988, 
will fund 50 percent of the project’s estimated $1.2 billion cost. 
According to its Web site, 
SANDAG officials believe that the Federal Transit Administration’s New Starts program — which funds fixed guideway systems such as light-rail 
systems — will fund the remaining 
50 percent.
According to Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of UCSD Strategic Campus Resource Initiatives Brian Gregory, the trolley system would reduce the number of cars on cam-pus emissions and the need to build expensive parking structures. 
He added that the trolley would 
allow students to travel to and from campus, and to other areas, more conveniently.
“It will benefit UCSD because it 
will give us options for the UCSD community to get to the campus, and then to go [to] other places from the campus, ” Gregory said. 
Muir College sophomore Amber 
Elsaad said she would not benefit from the trolley. 
“I probably wouldn’t use it, ” 
Elsaad said. “I’ve tried taking the bus 
downtown, and public transportation 
just takes too long. ”
If the recommendations are 
approved, SANDAG will hold a con-ference at UCSD to gather feedback on possible routes.
“UCSD has the opportunity to be 
very involved in this and contribute to expanding transit to the UCSD campus, ” Steinberger said.
Ticket pricing for the route has 
not yet been set.

Cigarette advertisement embel-
lished with flashy pink packaging may seem frivolous, but a recent UCSD study revealed that these campaigns illegally target impres-sionable adolescent girls, despite a 1994 industry agreement to disci-pline such practices.
“Cigarette ads have a powerful 
effect on children’s curiosity, ”  UCSD 
Cancer Prevention and Control Program Director John P . Pierce said. “Curiosity is a powerful drive that is more likely to lead to experi-mentation. ” 
In 1998, four of the largest 
U.S. cigarette companies, includ-ing Phillip Morris USA, Lorillard Tobacco Company and Camel man-
ufacturer R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, signed an agreement with the California State Attorney General to stop targeting youth, in response to studies showing that teens are more highly receptive to advertising.
However, statistics gathered 
from a five-year telephone survey study suggests that even after this agreement, teens exposed to a 2007 Camel No. 9 ad were more likely to use cigarettes. The Moores Cancer Center polled 1,036 male and female adolescents from 2003 to 2008 about their experiences with smoking in order to gauge the effect of adver-tisements. Participants were asked whether they had a “favorite ad. ” 
According to Pierce, although 
the percentage of boys with a favorite cigarette advertisement remained stable over the five years, the number of girls who had a favorite advertisement showed a significant jump after the fifth sur-vey, which occurred immediately after the Camel’s release of the No. 9 ad. 
In the fifth survey, 21 percent 
of female participants claimed they had a favorite advertisement — a significant increase from the previ-ous year’s report of 10 to 13 percent. Overall, 44 percent of girls named a favorite advertisement during the fifth survey, compared to 31 to 33 percent in the first four years. Pierce attributed this spike to the No. 9 campaign that targeted young girls. 
“Previous studies show that these 
girls who identify with a favorite ad are at a 50 percent increased risk to start smoking in the future, ” Pierce said. 
Congressional leaders have com-
plained that Reynolds’ campaign violates the agreement, he added.
For the No. 9 campaign, Camel 
placed the advertisements in maga-zines such as Vogue and Glamour, where ads often appear as fashion spreads designed to entice women with giveaway prizes such as lip balms, cell phones and purses.
“We identified that the jump in 
2007 was due to the Camel No. 9 campaign that was specifically tar-geted [toward] girls, ” Pierce said. “ And this shows they are still doing something they agreed not to do in 
the MSA. ” 
R.J. Reynolds responded to the 
criticism by announcing that the company would discontinue print No. 9 advertising, but would contin-ue to sponsor the campaign through internet advertising and in stores that carry the brand.

ficult time securing independent health 
insurance under the old system. 
“I had a medical procedure done 
two years ago, ” he said. “If I tried to apply to Kaiser as an independent — because of that prior medical history — I wouldn’t be accepted. ”
The bill prohibited that anyone 
under 26 be denied coverage due to pre-existing conditions. In addition,  a provision will go into effect on September 23, 2010, that prohibits insurance companies from dropping customers from their plan when they become sick.
According to Congressman Bob 
Filner (D-San Diego), who spoke at UCSD on April 6, the bill will also empower students whose parents do not have health insurance by mak-ing them a large demographic health care companies will listen to.
“If you’re a student and your par-
ents don’t have an insurance plan, in a few years, you’ll be able to join a pool of uninsured people — and that gives you leverage as if you were a part of a big company, ” Filner said. 
He added that the “leverage” 
would make it more likely that major insurance companies offer lower rates.
Filner also said the health-care reform will provide students — and the general population — with a government subsidy, based on a person’s income.
“If you have zero 
income, you’ll get almost 100-percent subsidy, ” Filner said.
When the bill goes into 
full effect in 2014, every American will be required to purchase a minimum health-insurance package, and will be fined anywhere from $750 to $1,000 if they do not comply. 
In 2014, individu-
als with income levels at 133 percent of the pov-erty line — approximately $15,000— will be eligible for Medicaid, a govern-ment program providing health insurance for low-income families. In 2009, the average starting salary for new college graduates was $48,515.
Marshall College freshman 
Tiffany Lee said the threshold for government subsidies is too high.
“I’ve worked a minimum wage 
job as a waitress, and it wasn’t a lot of money, ” Lee said. “Even with tips, 
you still lose a lot of your salary to taxes, and that would be hard to live 
off of. The bar for govern-ment-supplied insurance should be higher, since so many people make so little money. ”
Effective July 2011, the 
health-care bill includes provisions that will create a 10-percent excise tax on the use of indoor tanning beds.
Muir College freshman 
Julie Luu said the excise tax was a good idea.
“Tanning beds are a 
luxury, ” Luu said. “Every little penny [to fund the health care bill] helps, so it’s probably a good idea because health care reform needs a lot of help and it’s a good start. ” The bill also allows those who receive federal subsidies for health insurance to purchase abortion cover-
age for a surcharge.

It’s election season, and that means a strange — for lack of a better word — A.S. Council meeting.
At least two hours were spent in a 
state of confusion: first, over a Students for Justice in Palestine event, and second, over judicial board members’ availability for the A.S. elections.
Three students in costume — two 
in suits and shades, and one in an orange jumpsuit with a black bag over his head — addressed council-members during public input on their recruit-ments for C.I.A. (Criminally Insane Assholes).
Leaders from the UCSD ZOR 
dance team pleaded the council to help fund their trip to Boston, so they could attend nationals for the first time.
After much debate over the ethics 
of allocating funds for travel — some-thing the council typically doesn’t do for student organizations — council-members voted to fund the full $7,600 it would take for 18 ZOR team mem-bers to attend the competition.
During member reports, talkative 
presidential candidate Tanvir Dhillon  
announced his appearance in next Tuesday’s Mr. Alpha Chi beauty pag-eant, where he would represent the A.S. Council.
AVP Concerts & Events Alex 
Bramwell  said Friday’s Bear Garden 
will be moved to RIMAC Field in an attempt to boost attendance at the men’s volleyball game afterward.
During the question period, 
Campuswide Senator Carli Thomas  
asked a pertinent question: “Where is Utsav Gupta ?”
[Editor’s note: He was at Foodworx, 
campaigning.]
In fact, only 17 voting members 
attended the meeting — just one more than needed for quorum.
After a funding request from 
Students for Justice in Palestine for a hip-hop activism event and a “Writings on the Wall” event, an hour of debate ensued over the criteria for content-neutral student-org funding.
“Y ou all are picking and choosing 
with your freedom-of-speech battles, ” VP Finance and Resources Peter 
Benesch said. “It’s really weird. ”
About 50 
students, presum-ably contacted via text message from friends at the meeting, arrived 
to pressure the council to fund poten-tially controversial event speakers.
As it turns out, many council-
members were instead debating SJP’s spoken-word event, which was not the event in question.
In new business, a motion to 
appoint four new members to the A.S. Judicial Board temporarily became another contentious debate. 
Three of the four applicants were 
from the Sixth College Judicial Board — trained the same way as members of the A.S. Judicial Board.
The council debated the partiality 
of these members, and every other move was described as “shady. ”
A.S. Executive Assistant Heather 
Lucas  said that the judicial-board 
chaos was her fault. “These people didn’t specify that they were graduat-ing in spring, and were not going to be here in the fall… I should have fol-lowed up on it, ” she said.
Councilmembers argued about 
the judicial board with no motion on the table, and the general ridiculous-ness continued until someone wrote on the projected computer screen, “Resolution to impeach Utsav Gupta, WHEREAS it would solve everything. ”+W]VKQTUMUJMZ[;IV[/]X\I

It’s not the same sort of glut-
tonous regret that sinks into my stomach after inhaling a double-double cheeseburger with fries at In-And-Out, nor the same fiscal recklessness I feel when I blow half my measly Guardian  paycheck on 
a pair of cowboy boots — only to realize three days later they give me blisters.
No, my water-drinking guilt has 
more to do with a phenomenon that has pervaded my thoughts ever since I hauled my ass to college: my consumer conscience. 
Some time during my four-year 
stint at UCSD, I realized that almost every purchase I make somehow contributes to the demise of our planet. For every gallon of gas I pump, an endangered baby seal is clubbed in Alaska. For every page I print of an essay, an acre of redwood trees is annihilated. When I bought my first Russell Brand sweatshirt at the UCSD Bookstore, I was indirect-ly whipping the back of a Honduran infant for not sewing fast enough.
But the image that most haunts 
my purchase-induced day terrors is that of a helpless Nemo-esque clownfish being driven from his kelpy wonderland by a colony of Aquafina bottles somewhere in the North Pacific Garbage Patch. No matter how parched my lips, every time I grabbed a bottle of water at the Sunshine Store, my guilt far out-weighed the quench.
So, my first step in consumer 
redemption was to choose the self-proclaimed Mother Teresa of H20: Fiji water. Marketed as the trendy green choice for eco-concerned con-sumers like myself, it seemed like the least of evils I could turn to in times of thirst.
That is, until I happened upon an 
investigative article on MotherJones.com revealing that, despite the water company’s success (which has secured both Paris Hilton and Barack Obama as consumers),  Fijians themselves are suffering from typhoid outbreaks because of the island’s faulty water supplies. 
Not to mention, the brand’s edgy 
square bottles are made of Chinese plastic and cranked out in a diesel-fueled plant polluting some far-off land.
Somehow, in attempting to 
make a sustainable choice, I’ d added Typhoid-ridden Fijians to my list of day terrors. Now I wish I hadn’t lost the trendy Whole Foods canteen my mom got me for Christmas. I’ d buy 
myself another one, but those things 
are like $25. 
Maybe tonight I’ll sacrifice a 
couple hours locating my long-lost stocking stuffer — if not to prevent spontaneous sunstroke, then to dissolve my thoughts of diseased islanders. And if I can’t find the can-teen, maybe I’ll just continue being really, really thirsty all the time. I 
hear San Diego’s suffering from a 
pretty severe draught — maybe I can do my part with some good old-fashioned activism in the form of dehydration.ALYSSA BEREZNAK

The UCSD Guardian  is published twice a week at 
the University of California at San Diego. Contents © 
2010. Views expressed herein represent the majority 
vote of the editorial board and are not necessarily 
those of the UC Board of Regents, the ASUCSD or 
the members of the Guardian  staff. As journalists, we are instinctively programmed to fight, kick and 
scream for the eternal preservation of free press. The pillars of our value system include equal distribution rights for any and all 
publications, and absolutely no censorship nor government-influenced 
propaganda. 
These ideals, however, when dealing with student fees, must not inter-
fere with the stark pragmatism of the almighty dollar. Because, as it turns 
out, free press isn’t really all that free. Ink and paper — no matter how necessary to communicating the diverse views of the student body — are 
among the more costly resources covered by the A.S. Council. In the case 
of student publications on our campus, these provisions carried a price 
tag of roughly $40,000 this quarter — all approved and paid for by the 
council.
That’s an awful lot of bank to ensure that Fashion Quarterly can com-
ment in full color on the latest Library Walk trends, or that the Koala ’s 
marijuana leaves can finally print in green. 
All criticism aside, though, the wealth of publications at UCSD makes 
for an invaluable forum of public discourse. They show us that our cam-
pus, however notoriously anti-social, is filled with exuberant young peo-ple busting with creative, political wit and activist fervor — and they’re 
eager to show it off. 
Thanks to the A.S. Council’s “open forum” media org funding model, 
however, there’s no real limit to how much media orgs can request to ful-
fill their vision. Though allocations are still subject to the council’s discre-tion, as of this quarter, media-org funding has surpassed the figure in the 
council’s budget by about $35,000. 
A significant chunk went toward edgy new fashion magazine 
No. 15, which requested $8,693.43 to print 3,000 issues on glossy 
paper. Associate Vice President of Student Orgs Andrew Ang justi-
fied the amount by explaining that the publication wants to be a 
work of art that isn’t just “thrown away. ” 
After their brief foray into the seedy underbelly of absolute 
media control, it seems councilmembers like Ang are practically throwing money at campus newspapers to compensate. They’re 
itching to prove just how much they adore the concept of free 
speech, frantically scrubbing their hands of any blame for last quar-
ter’s unconstitutionally biased targeting of the Koala  in particular. 
With such liberty, however, comes significant financial risk. 
Though the council is sitting comfortably on a rejuvenated bank account after student activity fees were nearly doubled for Spring 
Quarter 2009, it’s only a matter of time before the budget begins to 
strain again. 
During last quarter’s media funding freeze, A.S. President 
Utsav Gupta proposed media-org guidelines that would allow 
the council to distribute a pre-determined base amount to any organization who wished to publish. We think that’s a great idea. 
Unfortunately, Gupta’s proposal also allowed for the council 
to pick and choose which publications would receive the paid 
A.S. advertisements. That’s where things get messy. The idea of 
offering direct financial support based on a set of Principles of

Dear Editor,
This is a critical time for the 
University of California. With the 
struggles students face against bud-get cuts, hate crimes and access and affordability to the university, we must stand in solidarity to ensure the qual-ity of life on campus is one of unity and diversity. Student government is an important political avenue that should advocate on behalf of the inter-est of all students on campus.
Student governments must pri-
oritize putting the issues that affect students at the forefront of the campus agenda. These issues consist of provid-ing students with an affordable college experience, ensuring a sustainable lifestyle, fostering student and civic engagement as well as fighting for the diverse student-body interest. The political platform represented by the executive candidates of the Students First slate emphasizes student engage-ment, accessible affordable and quality education, student unity, accountabil-ity and transparency. These priorities expressed by Students First focus on the most pertinent issues affecting student life.
In this critical point in the history 
of the UC system, California and edu-cation as a whole, it is time for us to take concrete action and entrust indi-viduals with the experience and pas-sion to best represent student needs. As the undergraduate student body president at UCLA, I fully endorse the student first, and I am confident that the Students First slate at UCSD is more than ready to answer this call to action.

President, 
2009-10 UCLA Undergraduate 
Student AssociationDear Editor,  
I was reading t h
e April 1, 2010 
Guardian  article “Board Passes 
Housing, Dining Fee Increases, ” 
and I was a little disappointed and confused ab
out the information 
given. Overall, I thought it was a well-written and clear article, but I was quoted as saying that I believe UCSD’s housing rates are the lowest in comparison to all of the other UC campuses. 
The next line of the article then 
said that UCSD is actually the third cheapest UC campus behind UC Merced and UC Riverside. Perplexed, I visited both UC Merced and UC Riverside’s Web sites and found that the on-campus hous-ing cost at UC Merced is $12,801 for the 2010-11 academic year ; UC 
Riverside costs $11,600 . A
ccording 
to UCSD’s W
eb site, our estimated 
cost for next year is $11,527 . Relying 
solely on t
he information provided 
on the schools’ Web sites, it seems that both UC Merced and UC Riverside are actually more expen-sive than UCSD, so I was a little con-fused as to why the article said they were cheaper.

Community — which could be inter-
preted in a variety of ways — opens room for funding bias. 
It may be within the council’s 
right to take stances on contentious political and social issues, but when distributing funds from a pool of student fees, councilmembers must strive to do so in an equitable man-ner — especially when said fees are ostensibly distributed with the pur-pose of promoting diverse campus discourse. 
Here’s our alternative: Determine 
a set amount of cash per quarter to allocate to each and every media organization that wants to publish. Give each organization just enough to publish two issues per quarter, including full color on the front and back covers of each issue. (This would allow for a color centerspread at no extra cost.)For publications wishing to take the form of a magazine, the allotment would be slightly higher, due to the cost of glossy paper. 
Based on the rates of Guardian 
printer San Diego Web Offset — whose prices are generally in the mid-range — the cost per quarter to fund a single tabloid newspaper would be just over $900 per issue. For a maga-zine, the cost would be approximately $1,100 per issue. The organizations would still be required to detail the specifics of their spending, but allot-ments could be capped there.After receiving their base funding, 
the media orgs would be free to pub-lish whatever they pleased. To cover any costs above their cap, however, they’ d have to seek advertisers, hold fundraisers or solicit donations. 
Again, as newsies, it is difficult 
for us to criticize the distribution of unlimited free money to our peers. To continue funding these organizations without restraint, however, would be to support an ultimately unsus-tainable model wherein costs could skyrocket one quarter and plunge dramatically the next. Adopting a universal basefunding system, on the other hand, would provide for equal-ity, council neutrality and continued support for free press on our campus.

Sorry, guys — that was one hell of an 
intermission. Act Two of “Compton Cookout: The Musical” needed some 
serious mulling. Plus, now that its springtime and Sun God unity is near, I think we can dig even harder on the beauty of what went down last winter — a raucous back-and-forth of action and reaction, with genius little script-quips flying between camps, and enough out-of-the-blue plot twists to send Scorsese back to the Dark Ages.
When we left off, Compton Cookout: The 
Party (namesake of my dear musical, which I proposed as therapy for monster racial tensions running through the cold eucalyptus groves of yesterquarter) was starting to really get loose.
Bros were aiming balls at sluts, sluts were 
harmonizing misogynistic Lil Jon and Lil Jon lookalike Jiggaboo Jones still lingered — 
like “The Wiz” in scar tissue — as a burn on our view of the awesome crimson curtain down back.
So, just when the sluts and bros think 
they’re safe beneath the memory of Jiggaboo — who will, on the closing curtain, return to take maternal responsibility for white sluts who dress as ghetto chicks when bros on Facebook tell them so — a mysterious goo begins to fall. Bucket after bucket of deconstructed purple drank is overturned from the rafters, unleash-ing a glistening waterfall of ingredients: streams of chicken broth, Kool-Aid, chicken broth, Kool-Aid. The “all you bitches crawl” chorus melts into a hearty “make it rain on dem hoes” — this time, just the boys, in baritone! — and purple drank washes the remaining fried-Straighter

Muir “Seussical” cuts and 
pastes the classics on a 
stage built for few.

>ey, guys?” Rachelle Fuhrer asked the harmonizing cast of “Seussical the Musical, ” most of whom had just returned from a pizza break.
“We’re back!” she snapped. “Seats, 
please. ”
Like complacent kindergartners in a nos-
talgic Norman Rockwell, they plunked into the chairs before her, eagerly awaiting instruction. Their picturesque obedience was broken only by a mohawk, a pair of leopard ears and the candy cane-striped top hat of the Cat in the Hat among the crowd. 
It’s a weighty thing to direct the annual Muir 
Musical, and yet another to transform such a hodgepodge of drama students into the smiley inhabitants of Whoville.
Somehow, though, despite a double major in mathematics/computer science and interdis-ciplinary computing and the arts, Fuhrer has managed to pull off both Thing One and Thing Two.

Think of the lineup for Warren Live as a miniature version of the Sun God 
Festival we really wanted. It’s two parts dance, one part rock and unlimited parts awesome. While San Diego natives Delta Spirit ease us into the evening with a nicely homespun brand of blues-rock, electro-poppers Junior Boys and Pop Noir really set the grind: Get ready to 
sweat and choke on glowsticks 
all night long. 
Pop Noir — a Los Angeles-
based dance-rock trio formed by British-born twins Joe and Luke McGarry — has been quickly picking up speed from debut single “DIY . ” The music video recently peeled some eye-lids after scoring a spot on the rotation for MTV’s new show “The Freshmen, ” setting their signature sound with an mmm-bop chorus and driving beat straight out of a long-forgotten 
pop ballad by Manchester 
luminaries New Order.
Pop Noir Guitarist Joe 
McGarry took a moment to talk with the Guardian  about 
the band’s identity, starting a record label and whether we can expect a little tasteful vio-lence at the show on Friday.  
  
G: “DIY” is kind of your signa-
ture song and aesthetic. Why the decision to start your own label and do all of your own publicity?JM: I think the main thing is that we’re control freaks. We do everything. As well as the music, we do illustration and graphic design, and we wanted to have the excuse to do all of our own artwork and promo-tional materials. We don’t have 
to pay anybody to do it, and we 
enjoy it. Then we figured while we’re doing that we might as well keep total control over the music we release, and all the rights to it, too. We are sort of weird about anyone else having input on it. G: As both musicians and art-ists, what’s more important? 
Does the music ever influence 
the illustration, or vice versa?See SEUSSICAL, page 8M^e

If dark Cohen Brothers comedies are your bread and butter, 
Ken Cinema will quench your craving for understated wit and twisted humor with Henrik Ruben Genz’s “Terribly Happy.” Denmark’s ofﬁcial Oscar selection and the winner of 19 international ﬁlm awards, the police thriller tells the story of a Copenhagen cop (Jakob Cedergren) transferred to a small town after a nervous breakdown. While adapting to his new position and the bizarre townsfolk, he gets entangled with a married woman (Lene Maria Christensen) buried in domestic drama — raising the age-old question of who he can truly trust.

Usher
Raymond v. Raymond
LAFACE
It’s no surprise that Usher 
chose divorce as the theme of his sixth album, consider-
ing his recent separation from Tameka Foster. After 2008’s Here I Stand  delved similarly 
into the tormented pop star’s personal issues, his R&B has taken a serious departure from its roots, transforming from club-ready, hurt-numbing bump ‘n’ grinds to a long soul-ful whine — causing sales and critical reception to (deserv-edly) suffer.
But on Raymond v. 
Raymond  — whose name 
is inspired by 1979 Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep divorce film “Kramer vs. Kramer” — Usher’s two per-sonas try to reconcile. He bounces between reflecting on his failed domesticity and dropping it like it’s hot for Billboard. The result is an incoherent hodgepodge of momentumless emotion that hardly manages to budge the empathy meter.
Raymond  may parade a 
potpourri of hotshot producers — Jermaine Dupri, Will.i.am, Polow da Don, RedOne, Danja and T.I. — but they only add to the overall inconsistency of the tracklist. Oedipal lead single “Hey Daddy (Daddy’s Home) makes a desperate attempt at distracting us from its redundant R&B groove with a creepy pedophilic con-fession. Usher’s signature rich tenor and impressive range are undeniable, but his muse has left the building: Over-tumbled loops and overuse of the pimp-in-the-club fantasy border on intolerable. We do get a breather with “Papers” — the first moment of hon-esty on the album — whose falsetto almost resembles that of (dare I say it?) a certain Mickey Mouse Clubber gone soulman, not to mention Usher’s young protigee Justin Bieber. Bubblegum synths make “Guilty” a less catchy “Baby, ” as Usher’s maturity level likewise drops to that of a 16-year-old: “I guess I’m guilty for wanting to be up in the club/ I guess I’m guilty for leaving and having a little fun” and “Y our honor, she accused me of cheating. ” W e can excuse Bieber a few rosy-cheeked playground jabs, but Usher just comes off R. Kelly creepy.

E-40
Revenue Retrievin’
SICK WID IT
Notorious for a madlib lyric format and syn-thed-out jive beat, Bay 
Area native E-40 doesn’t stray far from the winning formula on the  38-track double disc Revenue Retrievin’ . The album is 
made up of mild-mannered Clark Kent ( Day Shift ) and 
his Mr. Hyde counterpart (Night Shift)  — combining 
for a five-hour mixed bag that, by omitting the art-ist’s own hubris, could have been culled to a three-hour hit machine. 
Day Shift imbues the 
drudgery of the daily grind with the glamour of the big pimp. Its high notes are are wall-shaking neo-classics that throw back to 2006’s “Tell Me When to Go”; “Whip It Up”  features a 
silky-smooth Gucci Mane crooning about an “early morning hustler tryin’ to make a living, ” and “Bitch” stars the oily Too Short as a soft-spoken counterpoint to 40’s punchy baritone.
The campy “shake them 
dreads” mindset that E-40 popularized on My Ghetto 
Report Card  still thrives 
here, but sheer double-disc quantity reveals the 42-year-old’s inability to discern the badass from the ugly.
Uniform Day ditties 
like “Duck” and “The Weedman” drag on like a tenured professor. On the other hand, Night Shift suf-
fers from an entirely differ-ent ailment: All tracks are semi-tolerable, but none packed with enough juice to warrant a hit’s worth of enthusiasm. 
Still, Night openers “Over 
the Stove” and “Nice Guys” 
kick off Retrievin’ part deux 
right, the latter wuth a charmingly vigorous procla-mation that nice guys — you guessed it — finish last. 
Regardless of 40’s lazy 
lyrical missteps and mean-dering midway tracks, Retrievin’  boasts a quick-
paced, oft-electro backbeat and a host of witticisms as loveable as a foul-mouthed Dora the Explorer. This here might as well be vin-tage E-40, so keep shakin’ ’ em like you been doin’ it all along.

chicken grease from the wife-beatered 
fronts of all partygoers. Sluts’ faces are serene, for they are remembering a craving they felt during their quiet suburban childhoods to be slimed onstage like Nickelodeon peers in braceface.
As Jiggaboo’s brothers/sisters from 
other mothers melt to the ground like they’re on some wicked-witch shtick, a perfect marching block of humans in black body suits (with holes only for their orifices) marches across the stage, back and forth, solemn as pray-ing mantises, engaged in a gospel round of “Real pain/ Shut it down. ” This is a practical element in that it allows bros and sluts to escape and tidy up in their dressing rooms back-stage, while of course giving the audi-ence a great feeling of solidarity with this chugging train of Black Student Unioners and whoever else may be marching beneath a body suit.
The next scene takes place at the 
Student-Run Television studio. Joose cans litter the floor. A row of wit-nesses with their hands over their eyes encircle the ratty centerstage sofa, where a particularly hairy man sits in a poncho. He bobbles his head and unleashes a string of letters in no par-ticular order for five or more minutes, until it becomes excruciatingly incom-prehensible. There is a brief pause of welcome silence until he leaps up for his operatic battle cry: “Ungrateful niggers!” The witnesses move their hands to their ears in a grand slap and begin to repeat his toxic phrasing like larks on a loop, climbing in octave until we can’t even hear the words anymore. Lights down.
Remember, this is art. It’s sup-
posed to make you angry. The BSU block marches through once more, so that Joose cans may be brushed to the stage gutters and the SRTV office may be closed for business. They pace a little longer this time, but eventu-ally part their rectangle to reveal the limp figure of M.A. Fox, hanging from the ceiling by a piñata levy, manned by the heroic Penny Rue. We won’t even need a real actress for Fox — a dummy with red-rimmed orbish eye-balls will do.
Sit tight until next week. The real

 	&more prismatic language of Dr. Seuss, 
brought to life onstage in a whirlwind of feather boas and polka-dot stage lighting.
In “Seussical, ” Fuhrer explained, 
there’s “no formula — no right answer, no wrong answer. The idea, visually and theatrically, is that it’s a storybook coming to life. ” 
But her affinity for number-
crunching doesn’t hurt either. When it comes to financial matters, she and stage manager Janessa Marks — a major in (you guessed it) econom-ics — are “organizationally OCD, and nazis with money, ” and have allocated only 80 percent of the itemized bud-get to each team in production. 
Like all tales in the Dr. Seuss 
canon, the musical also carries an underlying moral lesson. 
“‘Seussical’ is not just about a 
cutesy elephant, ” Fuhrer said. “There are very real problems, like child abandonment and drug addiction. We’re just sugar-coating it in Dr. Seuss style. ” 
Her own sugary personality seems 
to stick the cast obliging and the show intact. Having acted in three previous Muir Musicals and choreographed last year’s rendition of “Kiss Me, Kate, ” Fuhrer now directs “Seussical” with the intent of keeping the process “organic. ”
“The actors are not puppets, ” she 
said. “They’re people and want to have their own heart and soul in what they’re doing. ” 
Somewhat contrary to Fuhrer’s 
amicable personality, her mantra throughout “Seussical” has been that “directing is the art of correcting the mistakes you made in casting. ” Of course, she hasn’t told that to the cast yet. But throughout rehearsal — less than a week before opening night — a string of onstage mishaps are more than enough to explain the wasteland of empty bottles on the table behind which she and Janessa critique the night’s run-throughs: Diet Coke, an oversized can of Monster and a venti Starbucks cup.
Cueing the music to stop, Fuhrer 
shouted at the actor playing Horton the elephant: “Jordan, you should still be wearing your scarf!” With a line of assault-rifle props pointed at him, Jordan is scissoring the air with his feet, perched atop a 15-foot paper-mache tree.
“Oh, ” Jordan replied coyly. 
“Should I go get it?” 
Rachelle continued fist-pumping 
the cast and crew through the second act. “Y ou have to learn to love it!” she shouted.
At the Circus McGurkus that fol-
lowed, one of the performers pointed out yet another technical problem: “I can’t back-flip in a corset. ” She did a run-through with it off, but another problem soon surfaced: Jordan is on stage when he should be in the air, back up on the tree. “How do I get back on?” he asked, Horton’s pink-and-purple ball clutched childishly in his hands.
Whether or not Horton finds his 
way back up come opening night, the air of familial ease bouncing between director, cast and crew in Mandeville Auditorium will make for an authen-tic storybook experience. Ninety-nine and three-quarters guaranteed.
“Seussical the Musical” runs April 
8 through April 10 at Mandeville Auditorium.

JM: I do think it all sort of feeds off itself. The art does influence music. I guess it’s really aesthetic sensibilities that influence whatever you do artis-tically. So I think the music we like and make is somehow reflected in the type of art we do and what we think is visually cool. G: Y our father , also an illustrator, 
notably designed record sleeves for bands like Joy Division. How did growing up with a father so engrained in the Manchester/Factory Records scene influence your own music? Did you subsequently try to steer clear of the sound from that movement?JM: We certainly haven’t tried to steer clear of it. We just decided to make the music that we would like to hear. The whole Manchester scene has influenced us, specifically late ’80s bands like the Happy Mondays 
and New Order. I think more of that 
comes through with what we’re doing. I mean, it’s not really a conscious deci-sion, but we’ve been listening to that stuff since the day we were born. I think it definitely has permeated. We are trying to make hip dance music, so there is no escaping it, really.G: Y et you guys got your start in the 
States, and are really more of an LA 
band. So what American artists are 
influential to you guys?JM: The American artists that have influenced us the most are from when we first started going to shows locally. Bands like Dance Disaster Movement — who were originally a duo — were running everything through loop pedals so they could play everything themselves. And that’s actually how we started out: with the two of us, a drum machine and two or three loop pedals, just looping everything. So they were a major influence on us when we started out. And I think that’ s sort of why we went into dance music so naturally. There’s really no other choice when there’s two of you and a drum machine. G: Do you consider yourself more of a 
Manchester band or an LA band?JM: It’s sort of tough for us because we mostly play in LA and are based in Orange County, but we’re from Manchester and our drummer is Chilean. So we don’t really consider ourselves anything. We’re not an OC band really, we’re not an LA band really [and] we’re not a UK band really. It’s sort of like our accents — it’s 
neither one or the other. We’re not 
American or English. We have no identity, I guess. G: So what’s the twin thing like? Ever 
get all Liam/Noel Gallagher on each other, or do you work well together?JM: We do get in fights, but it’s never Gallagher-esque. I guess that’s the benefit of being brothers or twins in a band, especially having moved between the U.S. and the UK so much. We’re sort of each other’s best friends, whether we like it or not. We don’t have to worry about each other’s feelings. If Luke is doing something that I don’t like, I can just tell him, “That’s stupid. Stop it. ” I don’t have to be tactful. Even if he’s upset with me, we’ll be fine in an hour. We have this close relationship so that we can say anything to each other. G: It might be more interesting if you 
guys started blatantly hating each other. JM: We probably should have more animosity between us. I’ll work on that. At the show on [April] 9 I’ll just punch him in the face on stage.  G: Apart from brother-on-brother 
violence, what else should we expect 
from the show on Friday?
JM: So far, we have yet to have a ter-rible show. If there [are] people there, I think everyone can have a good time. If nobody is there, whoever is there can expect to have a good time. My theory is that people tend to dance more if you’re in a huge group of peo-ple and no one can see you dancing — as long as you don’t stand out.  But 
I am expecting to have a good time, so 
I hope everyone else is too.

Come Join the Adventure! The good news: Dakota Fanning 
has never acted so young in her life. The bad news: She’s just as 
creepy as ever.
Based on the story of the first 
commercially successf ul all-girl rock 
band in America, “The Runaways” tells the story of five schoolgirls who come of age on the road and quickly learn how the music industry can be your friend one day and screw you over the next. 
The narrative focuses on 
good-girl-gone-bad Cherie Currie (Fanning) and rebelious guitarist Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) as they grapple with the trials and tribulations of instant success on a global level. The band’s rise to glory is not an easy one; as Currie’s ego takes hold and their Bowie-esque manager Kim Fowley’s (Michael Shannon) ego inflates, the group sets off down the well-trodden rock-star path to self-destruction. 
Not only has the story been seen 
and heard before — albeit maybe not with teenage girls, unless you count Josie and the Pussycat Dolls — director and screenwriter Floria Sigismondi makes no attempt to scramble the formula. Even a brief sexual relationship between Currie and Jett, which develops on the road, is so obviously foreshadowed from the moment the two meet in a grrrl-rock club that we’re impatiently wait-ing for the two to hook up for the rest of the film instead of watching the drama unfold.
But never fear, horny freshmen — 
that time does eventually come, and Sigismondi makes sure to slow the erotic lesbianism so we really get the full effect.
At first, Fanning plays her naive 
role with prowess, but her transfor-mation into the band’s bad-ass vocal-ist is utterly unbelievable and more dis-turbing than most scenes from “Uptown Girls. ” While tides of filmic fans lap up her rock-star attitude, Fanning’s sexy, glamorous Currie is just plain uncomfortable for those of us who still remember her as the fairy child from “I Am Sam. ” Things get especially awkward when she shows up on stage in lingerie. The 16-year-old Fanning — who’s made a living up to now as a child actor in roles that require a 60-year-old soul — simply hasn’t matured enough to play a diva addled by drugs and life on the road. 
Because the three other mem-
bers of the group are pushed so far into the background, the fight that 
eventually erupts between Currie and her band-mates — bringing an end to the Runaways — has little buildup or explanation. With a disturbing lack of twisty charac-ters or unexpected 
turns, “The Runaways” leaves little reason for us to become invested in the girls’ story. The only demographic that might be stoked enough to sit through the stock plot is the teenage girl grasping for a reason to rebel against her cush suburban society. Sound familiar, Fanning?

Se Habla Españolthat the score is 56-55 Duke, and I 
think to myself: “FML for missing this game. ”
3:16 minutes left:  I watch the little 
white sundial go round and round, but there aren’t any updates. Blue Devils fan continues to ask if there’s an update, while bad-breath guy talks about the business he supposedly runs. I think he’s lying, so I use my phone to verify his story, and it checks out. I contemplate which company has the best waiting icon. Apple’s pinwheel makes me dizzy, and the Windows hour glass of death actually makes me feel like I’m aging more quickly than usual. 
I decide the iPhone sundial is the 
best and wish I had a real-life one to gauge if Blue Devils fan has ever actually thought before speaking. An update finally pops up: The score is 60-55 for Duke after two Nolan Smith free throws.  Blue Devils fan throws out high-fives to anyone willing.
1:42 minutes left:  After almost 
10 minutes of real time, we finally get an update. I am deathly sick of Blue Devils fan. I begin thinking I should challenge him to hold his breath between updates.
54 seconds left: Butler scores and 
makes it a one-point game at 60-59. This sends Blue Devils fan into a ram-page. He paces up and down the aisle of the train and almost knocks over a lady carrying two bottles of wine from the dining cart. I think I just found my after-game refuge.
13 seconds left: It’s still a one-
point game, and Butler has the ball. I try to hide the info from Blue Devils fan so  I won’t have to deal with him.  I also want to slap bad-breath guy so he doesn’t breath down my neck any longer. God he smells. The anticipa-tion is starting to get to me. 
Three seconds left:  Game over. 
Zoubek makes a free throw, and Butler’s only hope is half-court prayer. I update Blue Devils fan and he jumps with joy, nearly breaking a leg when he lands. He lets out a yelp of pleasure and goes back to his seat. Bad-breath guy sighs heavily, which makes me immediately wish I had a gas mask. Fortunately, he leaves my personal space and returns to his seat. The poor lady who was stuck in the same proximity as us glances at me and nods her head in approval. Apparently, she was a fan, too.
God bless technology. Without it, 
I would’ve missed the almost best-game-ever.

with two home runs, one triple and five RBIs. Junior third baseman Evan Kehoe had a great day at the plate, going five-for-five with a home run and a pair of RBIs. 
Junior second baseman Blake 
Tagmeyer also had a two-home run game, plating five Tritons in the pro-cess. Senior righty Kirby St. John improved his record to 7-1 as he tossed six and two-thirds solid innings. 
“We expected a tough series 
because they are a talented team that has been winning a good amount of games this year so far, ” Lee said. “ As a team, we refocused and played very well in game two to even up the series. ”
UCSD returned to Triton Ballpark 
on Saturday looking to win the series in a doubleheader. Senior righty Matt Rossman threw eight innings of one-run ball, allowing eight hits and strik-ing out six as the Tritons eased to a 12-1 victory. Alongside Rossman’s skill on the 
mound, Gregorich and Kehoe did their part on the offense, serving up a combined five-for-ten day at the plate, including four RBIs and a home run by Kehoe. 
The second game of the double-
header lasted seven innings, each one controlled by the Coyotes. With a series split in sight, CSUSB put in just enough effort for a 3-2 win. Junior right-hander Guido Knudson grinded out six and two-thirds sweaty innings, allowing three runs on ten hits. He struck out six batters and allowed zero walks. Aside from a solo shot by Bauman, the Triton offense only man-aged three total hits. 
UCSD threatened an upset in the 
final inning by loading the bases and coming within a tying run, but couldn’t bring it home.
“Coming back to our home field 
for games three and four is always a great situation for us, because we 
have a good amount of success play-ing at home, ” Lee said. “In game three, we came out swinging, and Rossman pitched extremely well. We were feel-ing confident and ready to take the series in game four after that win. However, San Bernardino’s pitcher held our offense to only three hits, and the way we played is not reflected in the score. ”
The Tritons now stand at 30-5 over-
all and 20-4 in California Collegiate Athletic Association action. They dropped three spots to No. 4 in the national rankings. 
UCSD will now set its sights on Cal 
State Stanislaus in a four-game series. The Warriors have won six of their last eight games. While the Tritons head the league with a team Earned Run Average of 3.36, CSUS ranks right behind them with a 3.53 ERA.

After an incredible run that pushed the team to a 
No. 1 ranking, the Tritons’ momentum finally came to a halt against San Bernardino last weekend with an uncharacteristic shelling of 
their ace pitcher, junior right-hander Tim Shibuya.
UCSD saw its record 19-game win streak come to an 
end with a 4-3 loss to Cal State San Bernardino on April 1. By April 2, the Tritons had lost another of the four games in the series against the Coyotes. It was the first time they did not win a series since February. 
Shibuya took his first loss of the season in game one, 
when he was tagged for four runs on eight hits in six and one-third innings. His record fell to 7-1. Senior center fielder Robert Sedin’s single drove in two 
runs, and junior outfielder Aaron Bauman hit a solo homer — but that was all the scoring the Tritons could muster, despite their total of nine hits in the game. The men loaded the bases in the ninth inning but could not come through in the clutch. 
 “In game one, we battled and played well, but came up 
a little short, ” senior catcher Kellen Lee said. “We had many opportunities to drive more runs in, but couldn’t capitalize. That is something we definitely need to improve on. ” 
The Tritons rebounded in game two with a 14-7 victory 
on Friday. The offense exploded for 20 hits and 14 runs, with most action coming from the middle of the lineup. Senior first baseman Brandon Gregorich went four-for-five

mean missing the almost best-game-ever, between Duke and Butler. After watching Butler shoot a pathetic 30.6 percent against Sparty, and Duke trounce a very good West Virginia team on April 3, I thought for sure the Bulldogs would get pitchforked by the Blue Devils in the national champion-ship game on Tuesday.  
My ill-advised confidence guided 
me to choose a late train home. Hey, I thought, it’s not like I’ll be missing anything more than a repeat 20-point championship blowout. 
Good thing I’m not a betting man. 
As my train-seat rumbled beneath my stupid assuming ass and a crowd of people began clustering around my seat, all I could think was: Thank god for my iPhone.
Ten years ago, I used to carry 
around a portable TV . I would sit in class with the TV under my desk and the antennae perfectly angled to run along the bottom of the desk so I wouldn’t miss a second of action. But the TV wouldn’t have done much good bouncing from train station to train sta-tion like a hot potato.  
Had last Tuesday fallen 10 years 
before, I would’ve been screwed. But it wasn’t, and I was fortunate enough to have my cracked, yet faithful, iPhone in tow — equipped with a divine 3G network.  Let me first say that if AT&T truly is the fastest 3G network on the market, I’ d rather carry around a ham-ster running on a wheel to power my phone. I mean, come on; if an offensive lineman can run a 40-yard dash in under five seconds, a multibillion dollar company like AT&T ought to be able to do it in half the time. But, in the end, the slower-than-molasses-in-winter blue bar running across my Safari Web page only added to the angst and excitement on the train.  
As the game wound down to a close, 
I found myself sharing my elation with strangers I was quite certain I’ d never see again. Fans in Indianapolis, Ind. got to breathe the tension with some 70,000 others. Fans at home got to sit on the edge of their comfortable La-Z-Boy with their closest buddies. What did I get? I got some guy who hadn’t brushed his teeth in at least three days, a hard-core Blue Devils fan that yelled in my ear every time an update appeared on my phone and some helpless lady who probably would’ve rather been standing before a firing squad than sitting near us.  
In a game that I never expected to 
come down to the final minutes, much less the opening tipoff, I’m just glad that I had my handy-dandy 3G with me.  Here’s a breakdown of my experience in the last few minutes of the game.
5:06 minutes left: ESPN.com’s 
GameCast takes forever to load. Blue 
Devils fan keeps asking if there’s any 
update on my phone. He asks more times than a five-year-old would ask “ Are we there yet?” on a long fam-ily road trip. I start getting annoyed, and pray Blue Devils fan will shut up. Unfortunately, there isn’t an app for that. I decide to switch to ESPN’s ScoreCenter app. We finally discover
