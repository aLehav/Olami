CLASSIFIEDS..............11As Pandemic Evolves, UC San Diego 
Evolves its COVID ApproachCOVID-19
By Isaiah Irizarry  CONTRIBUTING WRITER
In response to the emergence of highly-transmissible variants and 
the rapidly changing nature of the pandemic, UC San Diego Health 
recently established new COVID-19 guidelines on March 17 in a 
memo distributed to staff. The guidelines emphasize the continued use 
of wastewater testing to assess COVID risk based on the concentration 
of the virus in sewage, and seeks to take preventative action to limit 
virus spread. 
While these guidelines are only applicable to the hospitals, clinics, 
and facilities of the UCSD Health system, they will be a blueprint for 
future COVID policy on campus. The Return to Learn program, which 
directs on-campus COVID strategy, is currently developing similar 
new guidelines to manage COVID in the long term.
In a comment to The UCSD Guardian, UCSD Health Chief Medical 
Officer Chris Longhurst said, “We’ve developed in the health system 
what we call ‘new normal’ guidelines. That was done very intentionally 
because we’ve been in this sort of reactive state of emergency for many 
years now, and we wanted to become more proactive,” 
UCSD Health guidelines currently split risk into three tiers of CO -
VID risk that are based on wastewater concentrations of the virus col -
lected at the Point Loma water treatment plant. Less than one million 
virus copies per liter are considered lowest risk. One to three million 
copies are considered medium risk, while more than three million cop -
ies fall in the highest risk category. 
According to Dr. Robert “Chip” Schooley, an infectious disease spe -
cialist at UCSD Health, Return to Learn is developing a similar blue -
print to manage COVID on-campus. The Return to Learn guidelines 
will feature a similar blueprint, based on tier levels. At the lowest tier, 
masking guidelines would be most relaxed and in-person events would 
be fully permitted. Restrictions would increase with each tier. 
Schooley serves on the Return to Learn Steering Committee, and 
is involved in the monitoring of data and operations in the program. 
He elaborated on the unique considerations of the on-campus strategy, 
including the logistics.
“The hospital worries about having enough beds for patients and 
enough staff to take care of them,” Schooley said. “But we have to wor -
ry about whether we have isolation housing for students, or what we 
should do about events, or whether classes should occur in person or 
in a hybrid way.” 
Wastewater testing will be a key component of both the Return to 
Learn Program and UCSD Health’s management strategies. The deci -
sion to focus on wastewater was based on research by Longhurst and

colleagues detailing the effectiveness of wastewater testing in predict -
ing COVID surges. 
“The paper showed that wastewater testing at Point Loma forecast -
ed cases of [the COVID variant] Delta two to three weeks in advance. 
[...] If we want to make changes in a way that’s proactive as opposed 
to reactive, we want to do it before the cases rise [...] And therefore, 
we hinged a lot of our thresholds on the wastewater,” Longhurst said, 
while adding that other factors are also considered, such as the pres -
ence of a new variant. 
Similarly, Return to Learn guidelines will focus on on-campus 
wastewater testing as a major indicator of on-campus virus prevalence. 
“We’re going to watch the wastewater very carefully. We think 
that’ll be the first indicator here in San Diego that [COVID numbers] 
are picking up. If we see an uptick in activity here [...] then we might say 
to people that we need to re-mask in various areas, start more routine 
testing and adjust our approach based on viral activity.” Schooley said. 
However, wastewater testing would not be the only factor structur -
ing the Return to Learn guidelines. For example, the presence of more 
transmissible variants could mean higher levels of risk even if waste -
water concentrations are lower. According to Dr. Schooley, this allows 
for health officials to gain greater understanding of COVID spread and 
react accordingly.
“We still want to [...] make decisions that are based on the whole in -
tegrated group of facts, rather than getting locked into something that 
might actually be the wrong decision because we set some tripwire,” 
Schooley said. 
 Schooley emphasized the flexibility of the new guidelines, with 
ample room for Return to Learn health officials to adjust their ap -
proach depending on how the pandemic develops. He added that while 
UCSD is currently at low-risk based on wastewater levels, correspond -
ing policy could change according to wastewater levels. 
“We’re still having students mask on buses, but that may change 
if the level of our activity continues to decline and things look really 
good in the summer. We are going to be continuing to adjust our rec -
ommendations based on the parameters we’re looking at,”  Schooley 
said. 
While the on-campus Return to Learn framework remains in 
development, Longhurst has published further details on the UCSD 
Health framework on social media, while county-wide wastewater data 
collected by UCSD Health is regularly updated online.

A.S. Graphic Studio  A.S. News Update: Week 1 and 2
By  Nikita Cardozo  STAFF WRITER
Week 1
In their Week 1 meeting, the 
A.S. senators discussed recent up -
dates with their projects and the 
issues with required in-person at -
tendance for classes this quarter. 
The senators also discussed possi -
ble solutions to required in-person 
attendance during their meeting.
First, Off-Campus Senator Mi -
chelle Chiew gave an update on 
the housing fair: it will take place 
on Library Walk on May 11 from 
12 p.m. to3 p.m. The theme will be 
“Housing Search Turned Inside 
Out” and the purpose is to help 
students figure out how to obtain 
housing off-campus and inform 
them about resources on campus 
to learn how to sign leases and ne -
gotiate rent. 
Transfer Senator Anna Zick 
informed others about her work 
with the transfer hub to improve 
orientation for transfer students. 
Zick claimed that they are trying 
to make extra modules for orien -
tation and get feedback from other 
orientation leaders on how to im -
prove future transfer orientations.
Next, Arts and Humanities 
Senator Rhianen Callahan gave 
an update about the situation with 
the anthropology department, 
where the former critical gender 
studies faculty member Dr. Saiba 
Varma has been accused of con -
ducting research that violated eth -
ical guidelines. Citing the sensi -
tivity,  Callahan would like to host 
an event on how to move forward, 
which will be open to anyone who 
wants to come. 
Moreover, A.S. Council will 
have professionals on site to help. 
Lastly, Callahan expressed inter -
est in hearing any questions or 
concerns about the library (Geisel 
and Biomedical) to discuss during 
the quarterly meeting. 
Art by Ava Bayley for the UCSD Guardian.ASSOCIATED STUDENTS
Then, VP of External Af -
fairs Adrianna Blackshire talked 
about the UC Student Association 
(UCSA) March board meeting 
and how they showed support for 
the United Autoworkers Union 
(UAW), which represents the in -
terest of student workers on cam -
pus. The resolution passed and 
they had a discussion about the 
possibility for the EVP to attend 
UC Hill Day. 
The A.S. Senators then dis -
cussed the prominent issues with 
in-person attendance policies for 
classes. Callahan brought up an 
example where students could 
only miss one lecture or fail the 
class. If they miss one lecture, 
then they would have to write a 
two page history paper to make up 
for their absence. Some professors 
are saying if students miss more 
than seven lectures, then students 
automatically fail the class. 
While professors are trying to 
return to normalcy by requiring 
more students to show up to class, 
these policies have raised con -
cerns for students who need more 
flexibility. Many of the A.S. Sena -
tors discussed the problems with 
participation points and classes 
that don’t record any lectures. 
Furthermore, they discussed 
problems that arise with CO -
VID-19; forcing students to show 
up to class while we are still in the 
midst of the pandemic is very con -
cerning to many students. Calla -
han recommended that students 
reach out individually to their 
professors to try to fix this prob -
lem. Sixth College Senator Khar -
ylle Rosario brought up the idea 
of creating a survey to have more 
information about the number of 
students that are facing this prob -
lem so they can bring it up to UC 
San Diego. 
Moreover, COVID-19 is still a 
concern. Eleanor Roosevelt Col -
lege Senator Isabella Ramos dis -cussed that it is rare for professors 
to refuse to podcast. Since profes -
sors want students to attend class 
after such low attendance records, 
they are doing everything possible 
to get more students to show up. 
Week 2
In their Week 2 meeting on 
April 6, A.S. Council informed 
others about their projects, up -
dates about the UCSD campus, 
and UCSD’s start to encourage 
electric energy. The senators espe -
cially talked about the new elec -
tric mobility project and the guest 
visitation policy. 
First, Arts and Humani -
ties Senator Rhianen Callahan 
claimed that the renovations for 
Geisel Library should be finished 
by mid-August. Callahan brought 
up a slight concern with book se -
curity: since there are no gates 
to set off the alarms if books are 
taken from the library, the staff  
in Geisel library has noticed that 
more books are being taken from 
the library. They are trying to re -
solve this issue without having 
to close the floors containing the 
books. 
VP of External Affairs Adrian -
na Blackshire discussed how they 
are trying to increase the budget 
for menstrual products to be more 
readily available in public bath -
rooms on campus. Many times, 
these machines are empty when 
students need them. 
Blackshire also mentioned that President Drake’s quarterly 
meeting will be happening on 
May 11, where they will discuss 
COVID-19 and the new variant.
Next, President Manu Agni 
mentioned that students in War -
ren College, Sixth College, and 
ERC saw a refund of $3-11 in their 
spring 2020 fees because those 
college councils didn’t use that 
money. 
Agni also said that UCSD is 
applying for a grant of $25 mil -
lion for a public transportation 
electric mobility project. Parking 
remains a big issue for students so 
they were looking for ways to al -
leviate this issue. UCSD has plans 
to build another parking struc -
ture on campus, which would be 
known as Voigt Garage. As UCSD 
tries to reduce their carbon foot -
print, they are now looking to 
build a parking garage and elec -
tric cloth depot is the new project 
as well as an electric bus. 
Lastly, VP of Campus Affairs 
Isaac Lara noted that guests are 
now allowed on campus and in 
resident housing. However, A.S. 
Council encourages students to 
get tested before visiting, especial -
ly if they frequent high-risk areas, 
like restaurants, gyms, and any 
large public gatherings.
 A.S. Council meetings 
take place every Wednesday at 6 
p.m. and are open to students by 
joining the Zoom link or Face -
book live.

RAYMOND TRAN
I had a particularly bad 
experience when I was denied 
a rightful spot in the purely 
meritocratic capped electrical 
engineering major due to 
Revelle Advising delaying the 
processing of my Quarter-by-
Quarter plan. Why was Revelle 
involved? Because the major 
transfer system is wired in a 
way such that colleges need to 
approve students with over 150 
credits to make sure they can 
fulfill the college requirements 
to graduate.
Contrary to their original 
intentions, the UC San Diego 
colleges create a layer of 
bureaucracy that should be 
removed to give students more 
flexibility in choosing courses 
and housing and allow counselors 
to better serve students.
According to UCSD, the 
college system is modeled 
after Oxford and Cambridge 
to supposedly “[combine] 
the academic advantages of a 
large research university with 
the finest features of a small 
liberal arts college.” UCSD also 
claims that colleges provide 
“tight community,” “attentive 
advisors,” and “inspiring 
amenities,” though my denied 
transfer to Electrical Engineering 
is a direct refutation of “attentive 
advisors.” To prove my point, I 
have at least 31 emails illustrating 
a strained and understaffed 
advising team working under a stiff bureaucratic system. As of 
now, I have yet to be admitted 
to electrical engineering. I don’t 
blame them. They too are victims 
of a system in need of change.
Overworked counselors 
are only part of a complicated 
problem. It is well known among 
UCSD students and affiliates 
that college GE’s are unequal. 
In fact, I recently had a HUM 
professor joke about Sixth 
College being easy. Concretely, 
according to a previous article 
from The UCSD Guardian, “the 
average class GPAs of each HUM 
course from Fall 2007 to Spring 
2017 is 2.918 [as opposed to] 
Sixth’s 3.231.” Because of this 
inequality, it is easy for students 
in one college to be envious of 
those in other colleges, whether 
it is the desire to seek a more 
rigorous course, or more often 
than not, the desire to avoid 
bothersome courses.
The current situation locks 
students into their college by 
making it hard for them to 
transfer. UCSD’s policy on inter-
college transfer gives a list of 
restricting criteria that can easily 
prevent students from switching. 
It certainly prevented me from 
switching. Also, the document 
explicitly states that, “Petitions 
for inter-college transfers based 
on general education preferences 
or the intention to double major 
or minor are not considered.” 
This is UCSD blatantly telling 
students that once locked in, 
they no longer have a say in their 
general education.
One may argue that students 
freely chose a college while applying so students should be 
held responsible to carry through 
their decision. UCSD even has a 
page to help students choose. 
This argument is flawed in many 
ways. First is that simply not all 
students get into their college of 
first choice. Second, it is hard to 
tell something’s true nature until 
one tries it out. Even if UCSD has 
a page to help students compare, 
nothing beats taking the course 
for even just a week, which is 
not something prospective 
students can do until they are 
already enrolled. Third, the 
college system fails to account 
for the fact that people change, 
especially during their formative 
college years. Even if the student 
likes the college coursework at 
first, that opinion may change 
later on.
By abolishing colleges, 
students won’t have to deal with 
two types of GE’s in addition to 
major and minor requirements, 
and will have more flexibility 
to take GE courses that will 
benefit them most. For example, 
if colleges are abolished, an 
engineering student may take 
a course covering the Western 
tradition, find that they don’t 
benefit as much as they’d 
like, and be able to switch to 
something different like a world 
history class. Furthermore, 
abolishing colleges frees 
students from a rigid sequence 
that demands them to make a 
tradeoff between taking a course 
or missing it and having to wait 
an entire year to take it, bringing 
the added benefit of simplifying 
graduation requirements. With less schedule conflicts 
arising from rigid college GE 
obligations, students can take 
potentially life changing courses 
that they never would have been 
able to take under the pressure of 
two GE types. 
Going back to the problem 
of overworked counselors, 
currently it is hard for students 
to book a quality appointment. 
For example, Revelle’s VAC page 
on myTritonLink is filled with 
disclaimers including “Due to 
high volume, it may be necessary 
to close Drop-in Advising early” 
and “In-Person Sign In (not 
encouraged during Weeks 1–2 
and Week 9 due to longer wait 
times).” By abolishing colleges 
and simplifying graduation 
requirements, counselors are 
freed from doing avoidable 
paperwork such as processing 
my Quarter-by-Quarter plan. 
This allows counselors to do 
more fulfilling jobs like better 
assisting students in finding 
courses that are valuable to the 
students, making career choices, 
and more.
Another issue of UCSD’s 
college system is housing. 
Colleges have housing units 
clustered together. This is great 
if you’re an engineering student 
in Warren, but not so if you’re 
in Revelle, which is farther away. 
UCSD’s large campus also means 
it will be less convenient for a 
student to meet in-person with 
another student in the same 
major and course but different 
college to study together, which 
may lead to the meeting not being 
considered at all to the detriment of both students’ learning. 
Abolishing colleges lifts UCSD’s 
self-imposed restriction to group 
students by college and allows 
UCSD to house students in a 
rational manner that will be most 
convenient and intellectually 
stimulating for students.
An alternative to UCSD’s 
current college system is to have 
only university-wide GE and 
major-minor requirements and 
to group students by discipline. 
UCSD is conscious of this, 
acknowledging that “many 
university campuses in the 
United States have a separate 
college structure, in most cases, 
these colleges are designed to 
serve specific disciplines, such 
as engineering or business 
administration.”
There is a good reason why the 
alternative (traditional) system is 
popular, in contrast to UCSD’s 
relatively rare arrangement of 
colleges “not based on a student’s 
major.” UCSD pushes hard to sell 
its brand of colleges to attract 
starry-eyed students who have 
perhaps been exposed to too 
much Harry Potter. Nevertheless, 
it is apparent that colleges are 
detrimental to UCSD students. 
UCSD has plenty of positive 
things that can be used to brand 
itself, but as a public university, 
UCSD first and foremost has a 
duty to do what is in the best 
interest of the students it serves, 
and that means abolishing the 
colleges.By BeNjamin Liou

NELSON  ESPINAL 
 Effective April 5, UC San 
Diego students are no longer 
required to wear masks in 
residential areas and may host 
guests. 
Though classrooms, clinical 
spaces, and public transportation 
remain masked areas, this shift 
away from quarantine is a fuller 
departure than times before. 
However, while some may 
declare the pandemic “finally 
over,” it is important to 
understand what allowed for the 
change in policies.
Shortly after the previous 
return to campus movement, 
students quickly returned to 
online classes in the sudden 
switch to remote for the first-two-
weeks-turned-four of the Winter 
quarter. 
According to the New York 
Times, Jan. 14 – part of this fully 
remote learning period – was 
the all-time U.S. high of new 
infections, coming in at 933,326 
new cases just that day.
Many students were sick 
during this period, even with 
campus population at reduced 
numbers and classes strictly 
online. Chloe Kurihara, a 
sophomore student from Eleanor 
Roosevelt College, recounted her 
experience in quarantine housing 
during this period to the UCSD 
Guardian. 
“Basically, once they arrange 
for you to get picked up, they put 
you on a little minibus with a 
bunch of other people who have 
tested positive,” Kurihara said. 
Students would arrive at their 
designated hotel, then receive 
both a room key and a KN-95 
mask. 
“They put you on the elevator, 
hit the buttons for you, and then UCSD Houses Quarantine’s Impacts
they get out and you’re just 
left on your own to go to your 
room,” Kurihara said.
Kurihara expressed her 
frustration with having 
COVID, despite her vaccination 
status:two doses complete with 
a month-old booster. 
She also commented on the 
complete isolation from others 
during this period. 
“The one thing that I was 
expecting that didn’t happen 
is that there are no checks 
from the school on you while 
you’re in there. So, after they 
send you to isolation housing, 
they tell you, ‘If you have any 
problems, you can message us 
through MyChart.’” Kurihara 
continued, “But, you know, 
sending a message through 
MyChart, especially during a 
time when they were so busy, 
because so many students had 
COVID, they didn’t reply very 
fast. If you weren’t contacting 
friends or family on the outside, 
there would basically be nobody 
checking in on you when you’re 
in there.” 
According to a study 
performed by King’s College, 
those who were quarantined 
were far more likely to report 
exhaustion, detachment from 
others, anxiety, irritability and 
a multitude of other symptoms, 
even after their quarantine 
ended. 
Connectivity with others is 
essential. Kurihara recalled her 
time in quarantine; she “did a 
lot of Facetime calling with my 
friends, which helped me feel 
like I wasn’t exiled, which was 
good.” 
Increased contact with 
others through online 
platforms may continue past 
the pandemic’s expiration 
date. According to BBC, Zoom 
predicts its stock will only As the UCSD campus continues to lift its masking requirements, the impacts of the 
pandemic are obvious. However, though the struggles of quarantine continue, we 
can examine the past two years and learn from the pandemic as well.

Staff Writercontinue to rise, even after its 
initial quarantine boom. 
Additionally, Vanderbilt 
reports on a study indicating 
that the elderly relied upon video 
chat services to stay connected 
during the pandemic, and 
that they are unlikely to forget 
their newfound technological 
ability to communicate, even as 
restrictions are lifted.
People’s ability and precedent 
to communicate with their loved 
ones, not only when face to 
face, but through the screen, is 
something easily overlooked. 
For the pandemic’s duration, 
we have done so out of necessity 
of social interaction, but as the 
world continues to reopen and 
people continue to diverge on 
their own paths of life once 
more, the line of communication 
remains available. 
Another lesson from 
quarantine is to try to look at 
the glass half full. Frontiers in 
Psychology published a report 
declaring that reframing the 
pandemic as something with 
good impacts alongside the bad 
helped study participants cope 
with the drastic changes to the 
world.
Kurihara used this strategy 
to tackle her own bout with 
isolation. 
“I did have a balcony in my 
room, so I liked to open the door, 
get some fresh air, look out. I 
looked at the sunset every night,” 
Kurihara said. “I was trying to 
pretend it was something like a 
getaway, like a little relaxation 
thing, cause it was in a hotel.”
People can take coping 
strategies like reconsidering the 
pandemic’s struggles and finding 
any potential silver lining. 
Positive reframing remains a 
commonly taught psychological 
tool to manage stress.
In spite of the hardship, loss and overwhelming stress of the 
pandemic, the world managed 
to continue on and find a way 
to move on. As the campus 
gradually lifts policies and 
things hopefully, finally return 
to “normal” again, the lessons 
about the pandemic remain. FEATURES  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , APRIL 11, 2022 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 5
Yogurt World, a self-
service, frozen yogurt shop 
located across from the Price 
Center,became a popular 
gathering spot for students and 
a memorable dining site for 
campus visitors. 
We meet Michael Tran, the 
Vietnamese-Chinese owner of 
Yogurt World, who recalls the 
brief history of Yogurt World.  
He faced challenges running a 
start-up business, setbacks and 
adjustments under COVID. 
The first Yogurt World shop 
launched at Convoy district, 
a commercial and cultural 
center for Asian and Pacific 
Islander communities in San 
Diego. Facing a majority of 
Asian customers, Yogurt World 
introduced a series of Asian 
flavors, including Milk Tea, 
Taro and Jasmine Tea, to the 
existing list of what Michael 
called “American flavors,” such 
as Vanilla and Chocolate. 
Among all flavors, however, 
“Plain Tart,” gained notoriety 
among the customers. Michael 
and his business partners 
became the first food vendors 
who introduced the concept of 
“Plain Tart” to San Diego. 
The rich, slightly-sour 
flavor soon gained popularity 
in the Convoy community. In 
2008, Yogurt World arrived at 
the UCSD campus. 
“So we’ve been here a long 
time. We’ve been here, actually, 
when this student service 
center was built,” Michael told 
the UCSD Guardian.“That 
was the same time that the 
expansion of the Price Center 
was finished.” 
Michael observed that 
UCSD has a large Asian and 
Asian-American student 
community and that many 
students dine at or purchase 
food from the Convoy district, 
which suggested a potential 
customer base. Nevertheless, 
when he began to operate the 
on-campus store in 2012, he 
did not know what to expect. 
With no previous experience, 
it was hard to predict campus 
sales. 
“On campus, the business 
is actually different,” Michael 
commented. “When we were 
operating on Convoy, we knew 
what the business was like. The 
amount of business every day, 
every month, throughout the 
year.” 
The challenges arise from 
the uncertainty of business 
in a campus environment. 
Facing a new customer group, 
the sales patterns of  Yogurt 
World on campus surprised 
Michael, who has had years of 
experience working in the food 
and beverage industry outside 
the campus. 
“The university would tell 
us we have a certain number of 
students on campus,” Michael 
said. “No one realized that Yogurt World on Campus, 
Challenges of  an 
Independent Food Vendor
after the quarter was over, 
the business would be pretty 
much dead. On the weekend, 
the business is slow. And in 
summer, it’s busy outside, but 
summer here is slower. But 
none of us realized that because 
we don’t have that experience.”
Upon their arrival on 
campus, independent food 
vendors like Yogurt World 
adjusted to the environment 
and relearned the business. 
With freshmen arriving on 
campus, the sales of Yogurt 
World during Fall quarters 
usually reaches a peak, 
according to Michael. Another 
boosting factor for the sales 
is the warm weather. Spring 
features the second-best sales 
throughout the years, partly 
due to the warm weather. 
While it is also warm during 
summer, business is “calmer”, 
according to Michael, since 
fewer students continue to stay 
on campus for the summer 
courses. 
Before COVID, the biggest 
challenge for operation on 
campus was labor. Throughout 
the years on campus, all Yogurt 
World employees have been 
students, with working hours 
ranging from six to twelve. 
Therefore, the schedules of 
students during Final exams 
and the absence of student 
employees on campus during the 
summer are important factors 
to take into consideration. 
“But usually during 
summertime, they don’t need 
hours or have to be here on 
campus,” Micheal explained. 
“At that time, the business 
slows down. So it kinda worked 
out in a way that we are able to 
balance that.”
On top of the staffing 
situation, COVID during 2020 
posed more challenges for 
Yogurt World. Since only a few 
students continued to stay on 
campus, Michael shut down the 
shop from March to September. 
To help independent food 
vendors like Yogurt World to 
survive through the pandemic, 
the university responded 
through a temporary change in 
the rent policy. 
“The Price Center said, 
if you choose to open, we’ll 
reduce the rent really low. If 
[you] didn’t open, you don’t 
have to pay any rent.” Michael 
said. 
Normally, the Price Center 
charges the food vendors 
minimum rent combined with a 
percentage of the sales. Whereas 
after the pandemic started, it 
suspended the minimum rent 
for the food vendors in the first 
month. 
In January this year, the 
university implemented the 
same policy to assist vendors 
under the Omicron variant 
surge. The U.S. government also 
helped out the small businesses 
in the country like Yogurt 
World to transition through 
the grants, as long as they were 
qualified. Michael admitted that without the assistance of the 
university and the government, 
“it would be extremely tough”.
Michael described the six-
month, shutdown period as 
stressful, but he stayed positive 
about the business in the grand 
picture. 
“There’s nothing I could do. 
I shouldn’t worry too much. 
Maybe use this downtime to do 
stuff that I love to do. I tried to 
look at it as, OK, this is my rest 
period. Just to make the best of 
the time that I have. So, I mean, 
I did a lot of hiking.”
Right after the sixth-month 
shutdown, Yogurt World 
resumed business in September 
2020 with an alteration from 
self-service to waiter-service 
mode. In other words, Michael 
and the employees took the 
responsibility to serve yogurt, 
provide samples, and add 
toppings for each customer. The 
aim was to minimize the contact 
with the facilities. 
“That was fun. That was 
challenging too. That was crazy 
when we got busy,” Michael said. 
“I feel like customers feel more 
connected to Yogurt World for 
some reason. The fact that we 
serve them was a very intimate 
experience. Customers really 
appreciate our service. Maybe 
they see us working so hard to 
get them the product. And our 
ratings got higher.” 
Although the new service 
model was less efficient, Michael 
recalled the stronger bond with  Michael Tran, the owner of Yogurt World, recalls the challenges and joy of running a business on campus.

Staff Writercustomers as “a silver lining” 
behind the cloud.
COVID affected the income 
flows but not the growth 
of Yogurt World. After the 
quarantine, the business at 
Yogurt World rebounded with 
sales in September and October 
of 2021. The sales figures were 
higher than pre-covid figures.
“Being on campus is really 
special,” TranMichael said. 
“Number one, the energy is 
really nice. Because of all the 
students on campus, [there is 
a] very fresh and young and 
upbeat energy, and also, this is 
the one place that I notice I am 
able to meet a lot of visitors 
from other states, other cities, 
and the world. And that’s fun. 
That’s what I enjoy a lot. Let’s 
say an outside community, the 
people you meet, eventually, are 
the people who live there. Here, 
you’ve got to see people all over 
the world.” 
Yogurt World and its 
on-campus nature serve as a safe 
space for customers to open up at 
the register and build trust with 
the staff. 
Yogurt World frequently 
interacts with student 
organizations. To cooperate, the 
shop makes it easy for students 
to fundraise. 
“We’ll give you one day to 
do it, from opening to closing. 
You make the fliyer, promote 
the fundraiser, and whatever you 
bring in, what we do too, we 
give 10 percent off to customers bringing in the flyers. And after 
that, we donate 20 percent off to 
the organization.” TranMichael 
said. 
According to Casey Tran, 
a first-year mMechanical 
eEngineering student, who is the 
event planner for Other People 
Literary Magazine, Yogurt World 
makes it easier to sign up and 
is more generous in donations 
compared to other stores. In 
fact, the reservation for April is 
nearly full and it even continues 
to May, two months ahead of the 
scheduled events. 
The team at Yogurt World 
plans to continue to develop new 
recipes for the yogurt, with a 
focus on the Matcha flavor. At 
the same time, it will maintain 
its social media presence starting 
from this Spring quarter with 
the help of a student group. 
Compared to an outside 
store, Michael prefers to operate 
a store on campus for now. 
“The campus environment 
is the most suitable to my 
personality, open and friendly 
and enjoying [meeting new] 
people.” He describes Yogurt 
World as a home. “Sometimes, 
especially with the visitors, they 
really love the yogurt. Many 
times the [customers’] feedback 
we [got] [was] like, ‘wow, this 
is just a fun visit to UCSD. You 
guys make it even more special.’ 
And once in a while we have a 
kid who would say, ‘Now, I’m 
gonna come here because of your 
yogurt shop.’”6 THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , APRIL 11, 2022 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT

Omar Apollo’s long-awaited 
debut album “Ivory” dropped 
on Friday, April 8, marking a 
fresh, energized, and truthful 
new era for the alternative 
R&B musician. “Ivory” was 
announced back in February, 
and was followed up with a 
string of colorful singles that 
readjusted Apollo in a new and 
subversive light, departing from 
his signature hazy acoustics and 
approaching his work with laser-
like focus. 
Apollo started off his 
career by posting his music 
to Soundcloud back in 2017. 
When he was sent $30 along 
with a note that said “investing 
in your future” from a friend, 
Apollo decided to record and 
upload his song “Ugotme” to 
Spotify. The track was swiftly 
added to Spotify’s editorial 
playlist “Fresh Finds,” gaining 
Apollo valuable exposure and 
racking up millions of streams. 
Following his newfound success, 
Apollo dove headfirst into his 
music, writing and releasing 
three EPs, “Stereo,” “Friends,” and “Apolonio” within the span 
of three years. These projects 
garnered the attention of well-
respected musicians such as 
Tyler, the Creator and Pharell 
Williams, the latter having 
produced “Ivory”’s third single 
“Tamagotchi” alongside Chad 
Hugo.
A self proclaimed 
perfectionist, Apollo decided to 
scrap the project that he had been 
working on at the beginning of 
the COVID-19 pandemic and 
return to the drawing board. 
Eleven months later, he had 
created “Ivory.” A true labor of 
love and passion, “Ivory” peels 
back the curtains of Apollo’s shy 
persona to spotlight the raw and 
intense emotions that follow him 
in and out of love. 
Packed with sultry pop songs, 
delicately layered harmonies, 
and lyrics that practically spill 
off his tongue, “Ivory” boasts 
Apollos range in all aspects of 
the creative process. It opens 
with a 45 second long title track 
that sets the tone for the project, 
introducing the persistent 
themes of longing, desire, and 
introspection that are laced 
throughout the songs. Over the 
course of the 16-track album, Apollo sings of sexual fluidity 
and self-doubt, seamlessly 
switching between English and 
Spanish on a number of tracks.
He oscillates between more 
experimental, production heavy 
tracks, such as “No Good Reason” 
and “Tamagotchi” and slower, 
softer songs like “Petrified” and 
“Invincible” that align more 
with his earlier music. The more 
energetic tracks are packed in the 
first half of the album, reflective 
of the confident grandeur and 
excitement that comes with 
initial love and lust. As things 
begin to slow in the latter half 
of the album, he has developed 
a transcendent emotional and 
physical attachment. 
Throughout the album it 
becomes evident that Apollo 
has grown into his music both 
sonically and lyrically. From his 
raw insecurity in “Evergreen” 
(“Was there something wrong 
with my body?/Am I not what you 
wanted, babe?”) to his soulful 
confessions in “Personally” 
(“What we got ain’t working for 
me/All it ever did was change 
the person in me”), Apollo 
reaches a level of reflection 
and honesty that surpass his 
earlier alternative pop tracks. By Zara Irshad
Editor-in-Chief 
His aching yet silky vocals 
accompanied by his rooted lyrics 
feel soothing and familiar, like 
looking into a mirror. Between 
the crush-ridden anxiety 
depicted in “Waiting On You” 
and the emotional insecurities in 
“Go Away,” “Ivory” digs into the 
fractured nature of being in love 
that is often omitted in music. 
One of the most poignant 
moments of the album that 
reflects this comes in the bridge 
of “Evergreen” where he sings 
“You know you really made me 
hate myself/Had to stop before 
I break myself.” The delivery of 
these lyrics builds in intensity 
and volume, layered with 
swelling music and intercut 
vocals that deflate right before 
the line “you didn’t deserve me 
at all.” You can hear the relief in 
Apollo’s voice when he sings this 
line. Coming near the end of  the 
album, this bridge feels like a 
culmination of the struggles that 
he has grappled with throughout 
the project. 
The push and pull of the 
tempo and style of the tracks 
in conjunction with Apollos’ 
introspective journey that 
unfolds throughout the project 
makes for a cathartic but healing experience. “Endless Interlude” 
and “Can’t Get Over You” serve 
as the fundamental pillars of this 
experience, marking moments 
of realization and reflection for 
Apollo. The former establishes 
his desire for confidence and 
independence (“I know deep in 
me there’s everything/what if I 
trust myself endlessly”) while the 
latter directly addresses the very 
struggle that he has grappled 
with throughout the album.
“Ivory” is an album of love 
and loss, the rediscovery of 
self-identity separate from a 
romantic partner. We listen as 
lust grows into love (“Killing 
Me,” “Petrified”), which grows 
into insecurity (“Personally,” 
“Waiting on You”), and 
eventually into acceptance 
(“Evergreen,” “Mr. Neighbor”).
The release of “Ivory” marks 
Apollos departure from his 
alternative bedroom pop roots, 
proving that he has come a long 
way from his Soundcloud days. 
He has taken his passion and 
shaped it into a craft, welding 
his songs into a story, and this 
album into his future.

People like “Harry Potter.” 
Not every single person, but 
there is an undeniable and 
dedicated fan base that still holds 
a deep love for the Wizarding 
World of Harry Potter and every 
character, creature, and place 
within it. The problem with the 
“Fantastic Beasts” series is that 
it is not “Harry Potter”.” It is not 
the same as the original series, 
and added on top of that is a 
mess of controversies  concerning 
several people involved in the 
film. There are many reasons to 
not watch the newest “Fantastic 
Beasts” film that have nothing to 
do with plot. However, there are 
also reasons why you might want 
to watch it anyway. As I waited 
at the theater to see “The Secrets 
of Dumbledore,”, the majority 
of people in line wore full sets 
of wizards’ robes, proudly 
displayed their Hogwarts houses 
on their clothes, and carried 
wands alongside their popcorn. 
This series may have its flaws, but 
it also carries great importance in many communities and has 
shown its capability to transport 
people back into the world they 
have cherished for so long.
The first “Fantastic Beasts” 
film was a fun and low-stakes 
movie about creatures escaping 
into 1920s New York City, while 
“The Crimes of Grindelwald” 
was a more dour look into 
American magical politics as 
Grindelwald was established 
as the film series’ villain. “The 
Secrets of Dumbledore” strikes 
more of a balance between its 
predecessors, resulting in a 
story that is easier to follow and 
will most likely set the tone for 
the series going forward. As 
tension grows in the wizarding 
world, Dumbledore (Jude Law) 
recruits a team including Newt 
Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), 
his assistant Bunty (Victoria 
Yeates), brother Theseus (Callum 
Turner), muggle ally Jacob (Dan 
Fogler), Hogwarts pProfessor 
Hicks (Jessica Williams), and 
several magical creatures to 
thwart Grindelwald’s rise 
in power. Along the way, the 
team faces a growing crowd 
of Grindelwald’s supporters, 
including his powerful allies 
Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller) By Kaley Chun
Staff Writerand Queenie Goldstein (Alison 
Sudol).
One of the most important 
elements of this film is 
the relationship between 
Dumbledore and Grindelwald. 
Fans have felt strongly about 
Dumbledore for years because 
of his guiding role in Harry 
Potter’s life. Some like him, 
some don’t, but his story is one 
of the most nuanced in the 
wizarding world. Dumbledore 
spent his entire life feeling guilty 
about his childhood friendship 
with dark wizard Grindelwald 
and the role this relationship 
played in his sisters’ death. In 
“The Secrets of Dumbledore,” a 
younger Dumbledore is forced to 
come to terms with this past and 
tries to redeem himself from his 
mistakes. Jude Law is the perfect 
choice to play the titular role 
with calm caution, and Mads 
Mikkelsen counterbalances 
him by playing Grindelwald 
with confident wickedness. 
The dynamic between Law and 
Mikkelsen is tense, dramatic, and 
personal, yet it is pushed aside in 
favor of a different protagonist. 
This sidestepping leads to one of 
the biggest puzzles of the film: 
what does Newt Scamander have to do with Gellert Grindelwald?
There is a disconnect between 
our hero and our villain. 
Dumbledore and Grindelwald’s 
relationship is fascinating and 
complex, but Dumbledore 
remains hovering around the 
edge of the narrative, waiting 
for a role to fill despite being 
the titular character. Instead, the 
narrative revolves around Newt 
Scamander, a magizoologist 
who spent his time at Hogwarts 
studying magical creatures. He 
is an unusual person to call when 
battling an immensely skilled 
and evil wizard, considering the 
facts. There is no proof he has 
been trained to fight or possesses 
any great skill except for carrying 
around his trunk of creatures. 
On the other hand, there are 
indubitable positives that come 
with his inclusion: Newt brings 
an awkward, understated 
kindness everywhere he goes. 
Fans have clamored for a 
Hufflepuff to take the spotlight 
ever since the original series, and 
Newt is an unique and likable 
character who fills the role. 
Though he is an illogical choice 
of protagonist, Dumbledore’s 
reasons have always been masked 
in mystery and hopefully more will be revealed about Newt’s 
role as the series progresses.
So far, the “Fantastic Beasts” 
series has proven itself to not 
be the next “Harry Potter” 
— but that is a practically 
impossible standard to live up 
to. “Harry Potter” was a cultural 
phenomenon that people grew 
up with and still carry near 
their hearts. People celebrate the 
series, announce their Hogwarts 
houses as a banner of pride, and 
remain excited to see each and 
every spinoff in hopes of catching 
a glimpse of the original magic. 
“The Secrets of Dumbledore” 
does not always fulfill this 
wish. It does not always make 
sense, the main characters 
are clearly less powerful than 
their opponents, and the stakes 
never feel as important or as 
personal as the connection and 
conflict between Harry Potter 
and Voldemort. Nevertheless, 
this film still has magic. If you 
liked “Fantastic Beasts and 
Where to Find Them,” you will 
probably like “The Secrets of 
Dumbledore” because this series 
continues to expand a beloved 
magical world and expresses a 
lot of heart through its earnest 
characters.“Fantastic Beasts:

Why Harry Styles’ New Song “ As It Was” is 
Perfect For Spring Quarter
I was lying in bed scrolling 
through Instagram on an 
average Wednesday when the 
announcement for Harry Styles’ 
new album “Harry’s House,” set 
to release this May, caused me to 
completely stop breathing. And 
if that wasn’t enough, just five 
days later, he posted the release 
for his new song, “As It Was,” 
which, ultimately, sent me into a 
state of cardiac arrest. 
Whether you’re an old fan 
still following along from his 
One Direction days, a newer fan 
just getting into his music now 
that he’s gone solo, or simply 
a fan of his funky fun outfits, 
you’ll
know that our boyfriend, 
Harry, never disappoints. And 
he sure as hell didn’t disappoint 
with his newest single, “As It 
Was”. 
Starting off with a fun and 
up-beat tune, this new song 
sucks you right in, making you 
want to embarrassingly dance 
while cleaning off your desk 
still cluttered with notebooks 
and essays from last quarter. But 
after listening a few times, and 
getting those dance moves out 
of your system, you really start 
to pay attention to the lyrics. 
And then that’s when he gets you. He gets you to let your 
guard down as he distracts you 
with his carefree funky tunes. 
Then, when you’re not looking, 
he reaches into your chest and 
rips your heart right out. 
At least that’s how it felt after 
I looked up the lyrics and started 
following along while listening. 
While there’s a lot of rumor 
going around that this song 
is about Olivia Wilde, Harry’s 
girlfriend, none of those rumors 
have actually been confirmed; 
even though it does seem that 
she was at least part of the 
inspiration for this song. Even 
so, the song still relates to a wide 
variety of people. 
After quarantine, the 
on-and-off surges of COVID, 
and the many other events, we 
can definitely say the entire 
world has gone through many 
changes. Some people went into 
quarantine with no bangs and no 
cats only to return with curtain 
bangs and a new kitten. And, yes, 
by some people I do mean me. 
Bangs and kittens aside, we’ve all 
endured life altering events that 
have changed us, for better or 
worse (although I do hope it was 
for the better). I can’t definitively 
say that this is how it was for 
everyone, but I know for myself 
that the past few years have 
been full of surprising changes; 
especially with graduation now 
being less than 3 months away.So maybe this is just me 
being nostalgic as graduation 
approaches, but with the 
repeating lines: “In this world, 
it’s just us / you know it’s not 
the same as it was,” this song 
definitely contains major themes 
revolving around change. And 
what better time to talk about 
change than in the spring when 
the school year is winding down 
and the flowers are blooming. 
But it also captures the 
feeling of being left behind. 
The lyrics: “Holdin’ me back / 
gravity’s holdin’ me back” and 
“Ringin’ the bell / And nobody’s 
coming to help,” are easy to 
relate to, especially as students. 
While most of us have seen a lot 
of change these last few years, 
it was also easy to get stuck. 
With the continuous loop of 
never-ending piles of essays and 
readings, 
there have been times where 
I’d suddenly realize I haven’t left 
the house in a month, and this 
song understands that. 
Of course, there are a lot 
of ways to interpret this song. 
Maybe it is just about Harry 
Styles’ relationship with 
Olivia Wilde or the struggles 
of maintaining a relationship 
in general, but I also think it’s 
about more than that. It’s about 
feeling as though the world is 
moving faster than you can keep 
up, getting stuck, and all the changes we go through, which 
just so happen to be a perfect 
way of describing this spring 
quarter as we all reach the end of 
the school year and, some of us, 
approach graduation. 
As Harry’s voice comes on 
over my airpods for what might 
be the 12th time today, singing 
the line: “I don’t wanna talk 
about the way that it was,” I 
begin to reflect on who I was a few years ago compared to who I 
am now and realize I don’t want 
to live my life thinking about 
the past.
With spring quarter bringing 
us to the end of another 
interesting school year, this song 
reminds us to move forward and 
experience life as it is. Whatever 
that may bring, for those of us 
moving into post-college life.

Like many others, I am a 
person who loves reading but 
constantly struggles finding the 
motivation to do it. While being 
fun, books are long and take 
up much more time and energy 
than a movie or television show. 
Reading can also be an expensive 
habit, with a standard paperback 
costing about twenty dollars. 
Over the past few months, I 
have worked hard to carve out 
time in my life to read which has 
been mostly successful. In fact, I 
am quite proud of myself. So, for 
those of you who find it difficult 
to read for fun, here are some 
tips that helped me out: 
Tip 1: Make a Booklist
Have you ever found yourself 
scrolling through TikTok 
and saving videos with book 
recommendations, only to never 
look at those videos again? Try 
making an official booklist 
for yourself. Just write down 
all of the books that you want 
to read so that, if you are ever 
at a bookstore or the library, 
you know exactly what to look 
for. That way, you have all the 
information you need in one 
place. 
You could also make your 
booklist a sort of “goal list.” I 
personally made a list of books 
that I wanted to finish this year. 
It can be extremely gratifying 
to check off the books on your 
list one by one. Just be sure to 
make your goals achievable. 
There have been too many times 
when I put a massive amount of books on my goal list, only 
to be disappointed when I only 
finished half of them. 
Tip 2: Read Books in a Way 
that Works for You
Something that I often see on 
social media is people reading 
books and having beautiful 
highlighting colors and perfect 
annotations in the margins. 
While I respect the hard work 
and dedication that these people 
put into their reading experience, 
it is important to know that not 
everyone has to read that way. I 
found that the pressure to write 
down my thoughts hindered my 
actual enjoyment of the book. 
When I realized that reading 
books and annotating along the 
way just wasn’t for me, I was able 
to read without it feeling like a 
chore. 
This also opened up a lot of 
opportunities for the ways in 
which I read my books. You do 
not need to own a perfect hard 
copy of a novel to enjoy reading 
it. For those strapped for cash, 
getting books from the library 
works just as well. If you own 
a Kindle or rent books on your 
phone, that works too! Don’t feel 
limited because you think that 
the medium in which you read 
your book is “uncool.” Reading 
is reading; don’t be afraid to 
enjoy it as you please. 
Tip 3: Set Out a Time in 
the Day to Read
Many students at UC San 
Diego have a schedule to which 
they adhere to every day. At 
this time they go to class, at 
this time they study, and at this 
time they hang out with their friends. Reading is something 
that you have to incorporate into 
that schedule. Otherwise, it will 
never get done. 
Think about a block of time 
when you do not have much to 
do. It doesn’t have to be super 
long, just about 30 minutes. 
Commit that time to just reading 
your book. I personally prefer 
to read at night, my set time 
being just before I go to sleep. 
However, if that doesn’t work for 
you, try reading in the mornings 
or afternoons. It doesn’t have to 
be every day either, every other 
day or even once a week works 
as well. Whatever works best for 
you! 
Tip 4: Start Small
For my last tip, I suggest that 
you do not get too ambitious 
when you first start out. If you 
are like me, you used to read a 
ton as a child but stopped as you 
grew older. Though it might feel 
a bit discouraging to be reading 
only a fifth of what you used 
to be able to, do not fret. You 
can work up to that amount in 
time. But if you start out too big, 
whether that means your books 
are too long or you committed 
to too much reading time, you 
might find yourself feeling 
disheartened when you aren’t 
able to measure up. So try not to 
make your first book a 500 page 
manifesto or a seven-book long 
series. Start out with novellas or 
short story collections and build

UCSD men’s volleyball (13–
9, 5–4 Big West) went up against 
California State University, 
Long Beach (17–4, 6–2 Big 
West) in a matchup of Big West 
Conference heavyweights. 
Coming into tonight’s matchup, 
Long Beach State was ranked 
No. 2 in the nation, while the 
Tritons were ranked tenth. The 
two teams had faced the prior 
day in Long Beach, where the 
Tritons were swept three sets to 
none. With the benefit of home 
court, however, this match 
would prove to be different, as 
UCSD earned their first victory 
over Long Beach State in over a 
decade in front of 888 fans in 
RIMAC Arena, 16–25, 25–19, 25–20, 21–25, and 15–12.
The Tritons suffered to a 
slower start, going down 9–5 
early on in the second quarter, 
struggling to keep pace with 
the powerful serves of the 
opposition. Senior middle 
blocker Shane Benetz came 
up with a big stuff to close 
the gap, which now stood at 
9–7. Quickly LBSU continued 
to build momentum with a 
flurry of powerful serves and 
conversions off of free balls to 
inflate the lead to 15–8, forcing 
a timeout. Towards the end of 
the set, the team showed signs 
of life scoring three consecutive 
points to cut the lead to 23–15. 
The first set was lost 25–16 
mostly uncompetitively, and 
the stage seemed to be set for 
another convincing win by 
LBSU.The second set saw the 
Tritons implement some much-
needed adjustments. The serves 
were controlled much better, 
and the team began to dominate 
the middle of the court with 
a healthy dosage of sets to the 
middle blockers. UCSD went 
to this well right away with 
a great set from senior setter 
Blake Crisp to Benetz to put 
the Tritons up 2–1, starting off 
their early lead which reached 
4–1. Another set up the middle 
came to senior middle blocker 
Logan Clark, who coolly tied 
the set at eight. 
Soon after, UCSD received 
two free balls in the midst of 
a rally, the second of which 
resulted in senior outside 
hitter Kyle McCauley taking 
advantage and giving the 
Tritons a 13–12 lead. McCauley helped to extend the lead shortly 
thereafter by slinging a cross 
shot to put the Tritons up 20–17. 
Just as LBSU closed the gap, 
Benetz stripped the momentum 
away with a timely kill to put 
the lead at 22–19. After a Benetz 
block and a McCauley kill, the 
Tritons ended a 4–0 run by 
winning the second set 25– 19.
Senior outside hitter Wyatt 
Harrison opened up the scoring 
in an all-important third set, 
and the Tritons would again 
look to dominate the middle. A 
kill from junior outside hitter 
Ryan Ka awarded UCSD an 
early 3–0 lead. After LBSU cut 
the lead to 7–6, UCSD went on 
a 4–0 run with Crisp’s serves 
targeting the power hitters for 
LBSU to take them out of their 
system, and an ace from Crisp 
gave the Tritons a comfortable 
11–6 lead. 
LBSU once again shrunk the 
lead, only for Clark to force a 
waterfall ball that fell down on 
the other side of the net after 
the block connected on Clark’s 
powerful kill. On the next play, 
a rally was controlled by senior 
libero Matt Palma, whose two 
diving saves put the Tritons in 
position to take the lead up 
to three, now 15–12. UCSD 
kept LBSU at arms’ length, and 
got within reach of victory in 
the third set when Harrison 
threaded a kill through a triple 
block to put the Tritons up 
22–18. Consecutive errors by 
LBSU would give the Tritons 
the victory in set three, by a 
score of 25–20.
In set four, LBSU once again 
came out inspired and jumped 
out to a 15–8 lead. UCSD came 
out of the timeout with a 4–0 
run capitalizing off of some 
errors from LBSU with the 
score showing 15–12. Needing 
a spark, UCSD got one from freshman outside hitter Ben 
Blakely, who scored two straight 
for the Tritons despite stout 
blocking, and sent a precise set 
across the court to McCauley to 
cut the LBSU lead to 19–17. The 
run ended there though, and 
LBSU forced the decisive fifth 
set with a 25–20 victory.
Shane Benetz converted the 
first two points for UCSD in 
the deciding fifth set, as the 
senior’s timely contributions 
persisted. Benetz followed that 
up with an absolutely stifling 
block to tie the game up at 
seven. Then, McCauley began 
to take over late, scoring kills 
that put the team up 9–8 and 
10–9, respectively. UCSD broke 
the back-and-forth with a great 
pass from Palma, which gave 
Ka the opportunity to score 
his extremely difficult cross 
shot to go up 13–11, and Ka 
continued his clutch play by 
scoring the point after to go 
up 14–11. UCSD’s Logan Clark 
killed the final ball from the 
middle to give the Tritons the 
set 15–12, and won the match 
in a great performance between 
two motivated teams.
After the game, The UCSD 
Guardian caught up with Triton 
star Kyle McCauley; about the 
team’s motivation after the 
loss to LBSU yesterday, he 
responded, “We were pissed off, 
because that first set got away 
from us and we left a lot out 
there on the second and third 
sets, so we were rearing to go 
tonight.” 
The performance today 
supported that notion of a fired-
up team, and the Tritons will 
look to build off this impressive 
victory with Saturday, April 
16th’s Senior Night matchup 
against UC Santa Barbara.Triton Men’s Volleyball Nets 
Thrilling Victory Against No. 2 
Long Beach State
UC San Diego men’s baseball 
(11–19, 3–5 Big West) lost their 
second straight game of a 
3-game home series against UC 
Irvine (19–10, 8–3 Big West) on 
Saturday. The Tritons entered 
the series on a two-game losing 
streak, following losses against 
the University of San Diego 
and California State University, 
Long Beach.
In Friday’s series opener, 
the Tritons found themselves 
down by a large deficit early in 
the game, trailing 9–0 heading 
into the bottom of the second 
inning. UCSD’s first run scored 
came in the second when senior 
catcher Blake FitzGerald hit 
a triple down the right field 
line, bringing home junior 
outfielder Marc Filia, who drew 
a walk earlier in the inning. The 
Tritons finished the inning with 
2 total runs scored, including 
a sacrifice fly from freshman 
first baseman Matt Halbach, 
bringing Fitzgerald home off of 
his triple and making the score 
9–2. 
Despite still being down by a 
large margin, UCSD displayed 
resilience in the innings that 
followed. In the bottom of 
the third, UCSD junior third 
baseman Jalen Smith hit a solo 
homer, cutting Irvine’s lead to 
6. Later on in the bottom of 
the fifth, the Tritons scored 3 
more runs. The first run of the 
fifth came on a sacrifice fly by 
freshman right fielder Austin 
Smith, scoring sophomore second baseman Noah Sudyka. 
This followed with another key 
offensive contribution from 
Blake FitzGerald, this time 
a double down the middle of 
the infield, bringing home 
teammates Jalen Smith and 
junior center fielder Luke 
Glascoe. UCSD rallied from a 
rough start to make the score 
9–6 after 5 innings of play. 
Although the game was 
looking as if a comeback was 
in store for UCSD following the 
fifth inning, the Tritons were 
only able to muster up one more 
run for the remainder of the 
game. UC Irvine tacked on a 
couple more runs in the final 
third of the game, including 
a walk in the seventh inning 
with the bases loaded, bringing 
home their sophomore catcher 
to give them a 4-run lead. 
Irvine’s last run came off the 
bat of sophomore left fielder 
Caden Kendle, who homered to 
make the game 11–6 in the top 
of the ninth, essentially icing 
Irvine’s victory. The final score 
for Friday’s game was 11–7, 
with the Anteaters taking the 
series opener. Irvine’s star relief 
pitcher Gordon Ingebritson was 
rewarded with the win, as he 
moved to a flawless 5–0 record 
this season.
Saturday’s game saw the 
Tritons once again having to 
crawl back from a considerable 
deficit early in the ballgame, as 
they trailed the Anteaters 5–0 
after the first inning. UC Irvine 
came out of the gates aggressive 
at the plate, accumulating a 
total of 6 hits in the top of 
the first. UCSD scored their first run of the game on a 
sacrifice fly by senior shortstop 
Michael Fuhrman, bringing 
his teammate Marc Filia home, 
making the score 5–1 in the 
bottom of the second. 
The third and fourth innings 
did not see any scoring between 
either teams, but in the fifth 
inning, the scoring picked up 
again. The Anteaters scored 
an additional 4 runs on 5 hits 
in the top of the 5th inning, 
making the game 9–1. For 
the second game in a row, the 
Tritons were able to trim UC 
Irvine’s large lead by continuing 
to keep their heads in the game 
and not giving up. UCSD scored 
2 runs in the bottom of the 
fifth when Noah Sudyka hit a 
2-run blast to left field, scoring himself and Michael Fuhrman, 
cutting Irvine’s lead to 6. In 
the sixth inning, UCSD’s senior 
first baseman Ryan McNally hit 
a 2-run home run of his own, 
followed by an RBI single by 
Marc Filia in the bottom of 
the seventh inning, making the 
score 9–6. 
In the top of the eighth 
inning, the Anteaters answered 
back with a two-run home 
run by redshirt junior second 
baseman Justin Torres, giving 
UC Irvine an 11–6 lead. 
Although the Tritons were able 
to score 3 more runs in the 
bottom of the eighth, their late 
efforts fell just short as UC 
Irvine won Saturday’s game 
11–9, in what was another high-
scoring affair. After the game on Saturday, 
Tritons head coach Eric 
Newman spoke to the UCSD 
Guardian on the resilience he 
saw from his team despite the 
rough starts in the first two 
games of the series.
“I thought the guys continued 
to stay ready to go. We fought 
all the way back again and had a 
couple of opportunities to win. 
I think from that standpoint, 
I think the guys understood 
it was going to be a challenge, 
but they were up for it,” said 
Newman. 
Following their series against 
UC Irvine, the Tritons will 
take on UC Santa Barbara in a 
3-game series from Thursday 
through Saturday, April 14th 
to 16th.Triton Baseball Drops First Two of  Series Against UC IrvineBy Donovan Perez-Schipper
