Under President Barack Obama’s 
proposed 2010-11 budget, the 
Department of Education would receive $46.7 billion toward fund-ing various student-loan programs, aimed at increasing affordability and accessibility for college students.
The Senate and House of 
Representatives approved two similar versions of the $3.5 trillion federal bud-get last week, which would both sup-port an increase of the maximum Pell Grant award from $5,350 in 2009-10 to $5,500 for the 2010-11 academic year.
Congress will work to reach a com-
promise on the two versions of the budget beginning April 21.
The Department of Education 
was allotted $59.2 billion from the 2009-10 budget, and Congress already approved an additional $81.1 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act earlier this year.
“While these budget resolutions 
are only guidelines for the final fed-eral spending plan for 2010, early indications that we are pleased to see include a possible increase in funding for higher education —  especially for 
Pell grants, which are so important to our students, ” UC spokesman Chris Harrington said.
Lastly, the budget would eliminate 
the Federal Family Education Loan Program — issued through banks and other private lenders — mak-ing the Federal Direct Loan Program, which is funded by the Department of Education, the single option for students seeking financial support. It would also increase funding for the Federal Perkins Loan Program from $1 billion to $5 billion, while doubling the 1,800 colleges that cur-rently participate in the program. The plan would provide an estimated 2.7 million additional students with the Perkins Loan — a five-fold increase over the existing 500,000 students receiving the loan now. 
The United States Student 
Association — a student-led organi-
zation whose members include sev-eral UC students — is lobbying for the House of Representatives’ version of the bill, due to its higher non-discretionary spending on programs that the government considers man-datory, such as Social Security. It also includes “budget reconciliation, ” a controversial partisan procedural tac-

During the four hours 
before A.S. election results 
were announced last Friday, the Elections Review Committee found the Student Voice! slate guilty of campaign plagiarism and found two college senator candidates guilty of illicit “dorm storming” practices.
A.S. President-elect Utsav 
Gupta filed a violations report on April 9, accusing Student Voice! of pla-giarizing the campaign phrase “Uncage Sun God” and several other elements of his Web site. 
Sixth college juniors 
Brian Ng and Mona Vakilifathi, who pre-sented the case on Gupta’s behalf, argued that “uncaging” Sun God was an original idea, coined and used by Gupta throughout his campaign and on his Web site. The site was launched March 9, well before Student Voice! used the same term on a Web site launched 
April 1. 
Ng and Vakilifathi 
also argued that Student Voice! plagia-rized the image slide-show and pop-up text featured on Gupta’s Web site  — as well as two images comple-menting his platforms to halt tuition increas-es and protect free 
speech.
“The similarities on the Web 
sites are too common, ” Vakilifathi 
said. Ng said Gupta was not look-
ing to disqualify Student Voice! from the election, but was merely seeking a public apology and removal of the Web site.
A.S. Elections Manager Frank 
Carroll mediated the discussion. 
Rishi Ghosh, creator of the 
Student Voice! Web site,  defend-
ed the slate’s right to use the images by arguing that they were acquired through free, public-domain sources. He said that the code and software used to layout the Web site were completely dif-ferent than those used by Gupta.
Ghosh also argued that the By Reza Farazmand tNews EditorThough still in early

5HVTP:^LV(UP[H=LYNPZ+HUPLSSL>HYYLUidea of an “uncaged” Sun God was 
first coined last year by writers at the Guardian , making Gupta’s claim of 
original ownership unfounded.  
After hearing both sides, the 
committee voted that the phrase “Uncage Sun God” was not Gupta’s original idea and therefore not pla-giarized, but that the Student Voice! Web site as a whole was plagia-rized. However, committee members then voted that the plagiarism was not a violation of the A.S. Election Code, and decided to take no action against the Student Voice! slate. 
In addition, Marshall Senator-
elect Brian McEuen accused Marshall Senator-elect Shervin Sarraf Anghoozeh of “dorm storm-ing, ” — the act of soliciting door to door in residence halls — while  Warren College Council President-elect Emily Law and Warren Senator-elect Josh Grossman made similar accusations against Warren senator candidate Tyler Nelson.
The committee found Nelson 
guilty of illegally posting campaign flyers on the doors of several Warren College apartments, but voted against disqualifying him. Instead, the committee decided that Nelson should apologize to Grossman. 
Similarly, Anghoozeh was found 
guilty of illegally contacting Marshall residents to encourage them to vote. The committee asked him to issue an apology to the three residents he had contacted who helped present the case against him.

“Get to the part that matters, 
Frank!” Bean cried as Carroll explained the single transferable voting system, in which students rank candidates in order of preference.
Independent presidential candidate 
Utsav Gupta emerged victorious by a landslide, claiming leadership of the council and putting an end to three consecutive years of Student Voice! domination over the coveted top office. 
Though he celebrated excitedly, 
surrounded by a cheering entourage of friends and campaign staffers, the triumphant Gupta adopted a serious tone to acknowledge the challenges of his new position.
“The first thing I’m going to do is 
learn, ” Gupta said. “There’s a lot I have to learn if I’m going to accomplish things for the student body and do everything I promised. It’s a sizeable responsibility and I understand that, but I think the students are willing to work with me. Students want to see an A.S. [Council] that does tangible things for them. The first step to doing that is to learn as much as I can before I take office. ”
Trailing Gupta by just under 1,000 
votes was second-place candidate Adam Teitelbaum, face of the newly established Clean Slate. Student Voice! candidate Erin Brodwin followed Gupta and Teitelbaum, securing the fewest votes among  the three presiden-
tial hopefuls.
“I think all three of us ran a very 
solid race, ” Teitelbaum said after Gupta’s victory. “I think Utsav and Erin were phenomenal candidates, and I think any three of us in the position would have done great things. The students spoke, and they chose who they wanted. ”
Gupta will be joined in his execu-
tive post by new Vice President of Finance and Resources Peter Benesch, Vice President of Student Life Ricsie Hernandez and Vice President of External Affairs Gracelynne West.
The newly elected councilmembers 
will take over seventh week. 
Benesch, who worked with outgo-
ing VP Finance Naasir Lakhani to develop a new system of allocating funds to student organizations, said he will devote his attention to ensuring the success of this revised process.
“I want to make it easier for stu-
dent orgs to go to A.S. so they’ll have funding for their events, ” he said. “They’re so stressed because they want to do this and this and they don’t have money for it. There are always barriers to them doing what we want them to do. Now, it’s like: If you have an idea, come to us and we’ll help you do what you want to do. ”
West will have the opportunity to 
demonstrate her effectiveness in office right away, when the UC Board of Regents arrives at UCSD next month for a meeting where it is expected to raise systemwide tuition by as much as 10 percent. 
“I definitely want to mobilize 
everyone to go to the regents meeting … show my face, tell people about the 
regents meeting that’s coming up, defi-nitely have students’ presence there, ” West said. 
VP Student Life candidate 
Stephanie Usry, who ran with the Clean Slate, said she is still committed to fulfilling her campaign promises despite her defeat. 
“I’ll still work for student involve-
ment, and maybe being outside of A.S. bureaucracy will be a good thing, ” Usry said.  
Usry, who aimed to increase stu-
dent participation in the council’s pro-ceedings, said she hopes the newly elected Hernandez will expand and improve upon the Student Life office.
“Broaden the horizons of the office, ” 
she said, addressing Hernandez. “Don’t just focus on appointing the [associate vice presidents]. Make it’s something different from what it has been. ”
Student Voice! fared well in the 
hotly contested campuswide senator race, claiming six out of eight senate seats with candidates Katie Hall, Wafa Ben Hassine, Bryant Pena, Desiree Prevo, Carli Thomas and Alex Vu. 
Clean Slate snagged the remaining 
two senate positions, seating Tobias Haglund and Adam Kenworthy.  
A total of 5,397 students cast 
their votes on TritonLink last week.  Eleanor Roosevelt College boasted the highest voter turnout rate, at 27 per-cent of its student body; Earl Warren College saw the lowest turnout rate at 22 percent.
The student-fee referendum on the 
Sixth College ballot was passed by a margin of 63 votes, increasing the col-lege’s quarterly activity fee by $3 and filling out the Sixth College Council coffers. A similar referendum on the John Muir College ballot was shot down by a margin of 89 votes.

tic that would limit debate on pro-
posed policies by allowing the passage of a budget by a simple majority vote, rather than the usual 60 votes needed to prevent a filibuster. 
“U.S.S.A. is supporting the House 
version of the budget because the House version increases the discre-tionary spending by 3.5 percent, which goes to helping programs like TRIO and G.E.A.R.-U.P . [Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs], and other federal funded academic prepara-tion programs, ” said Clais Daniels-Edwards, legislative director for the UC Student Association, which is affiliated with the U.S.S.A.
The House’s version of the bud-
get includes reconciliation, while the Senate’s version does not. If recon-ciliation were included in the final-ized federal budget, this contentious measure — labeled by Republicans as a heavy-handed tool used by majority Democrats to silence the minority — would expedite the pro-cess of enacting spending and taxa-tion legislation by preventing a fili-buster by Senate Republicans.
“[Reconciliation] would create a $1 
billion savings by removing some of the government subsidized money to sup-port FFEL lenders, ” Daniels-Edwards said. “These savings would go to the Pell Grant, thus being able to increase the maximum award if possible, and make it available to more students. ” 
Apart from these particular 
higher-education funding changes, Harrington said the budget is still in its early stages, and does not spell out allocations for most programs.

Recently I’ve noticed something 
strange: Jobs are disappearing, student fees are increasing and 
Perks has cut back its hours of opera-tion. After some diligent research I discovered that it has to do with a little something that Wall Street hot-shots like to call “the economy. ” 
It’s unclear whether this economy 
is to blame for the death of my child-hood dog, but it’s definitely the rea-son I can’t afford double-quilted toilet paper. According to experts, it’s out of control and it’s not going to stop anytime soon. 
But don’t panic: Y ou might not have 
to sacrifice your $300 handbag fetish quite yet. I’ve developed some strate-gies to help you cut down the cost of boring necessities and up your cash flow so that you can continue purchas-ing luxury items. After all, where else would you get your self-worth?  
1) Consider relaxing your hygien-
ic efforts. Most toiletries are quite pricey, so avoiding their everyday use is a great way to save cash. Y ou can cut your toothpaste use, for example, to twice a week and save up to buy that leather-bound Moleskine journal you’ve been eyeing. Some may argue that poor hygienic practices might actually increase costs by requiring more doctor visits, but research in this particular area is inconclusive at best. 
2) Reassess your definition of 
“necessity. ” Y ou might not realize this, but we have been brainwashed into thinking certain items are indispens-able when they are actually useless. Take socks for instance, or underwear — they are simply excess layers of cloth on your body that lack any real func-tion. Sell these items to your friends and family and don’t buy new ones. Use your earnings to buy an expensive bottle of champagne and save it for textbook-buying season. After you’ve purchased a $200 book about fos-sils, you can run home and drink the champagne. As it trickles through your system, you won’t feel so poor after all.
3) Go into crime.  They don’t 
teach you this in college because it would throw off the natural balance of the world, but crime is an extreme-ly lucrative business. Drug dealers can choose from many different types of substances — ranging from study-friendly to recreational — and tar-get a particular group of students to whom they can market their product (i.e. Adderall is to Geisel what pot is to the Student Center). If drugs aren’t your thing, try kidnapping a local ele-mentary school kid (I’ d recommend a La Jolla Country Day School student over a Preuss School one) and asking for a reasonable ransom. Just imagine all the late-night Alberto’s runs you 
could fund with cash like that.
Remember, the way you earn your 
income is nowhere near as important 
as the awesome stuff you can buy with it. After all, getting good jobs so we can buy cool stuff is the reason we all went to college in the first place. And if the current system is failing us, we must fight back. So go on, start stalking that elementary school 
student. It just might be the only way 
you can keep up with your comfort-able college lifestyle.(S`ZZH)LYLaUHR

A.S. President-Elect
My name is Utsav Gupta, and I am 
your next A.S. president. I ran for this position because I want to create a stu-dent government that works for every student here at UCSD. Over the past few years, I have witnessed our student government become complacent on some of our most important issues. 
Many students don’t know exactly 
what their student government does. Often, the only time you see your representatives is when they’re asking 
for your vote come Spring Quarter. 
As your president, I hope to create an A.S. Council that is visible, smart, and works for your needs.
To this end, I promise several tangi-
ble benefits to your college experience, which are as follows: uncage Sun God and bring it back to the rest of UCSD, lobby against the $800 increase in tuition next year, support and expand our athletics programs and fight for our free-speech rights on campus.
These goals are ambitious, and 
s o m e  m a y  t a k e  m o r e  t h a n  j u s t  m y  term to accomplish. However, unlike what the Guardian would have you 
believe, these goals are entirely pos-sible. I believe that your A.S. Council  
has to work harder on multiyear goals, building an institutional memory that we can use to serve you. 
A good example is intercollegiate 
football. The survey that I placed on the ballot proves that a majority — over 70 percent of the over 5,000 students who voted — would like to see a football team. Almost 65 percent of those who 
voted even say they would pay for it. 
In endorsing me, the Guardian  called 
my hope for a team “farfetched” and “nauseatingly expensive. ”
I think we’ve proven with our vote 
that the idea isn’t so farfetched. I’ve spoken to administrators about the issue, and each one has told me, “If the students want it, they can get it. ” We’ve definitely proven that students want it. 
Now, we need to act on it. To 
accomplish these goals, we first need to create an A.S. Council that can actu-ally work. This year has been marked by internal bickering, most of which comes from legislation proposed that only affects the council internally.
Our internal problems stem from 
a change to the A.S. constitution that “reset” the council’s institutional mem-ory. Working relationships are poorly defined in our standing rules, and there’s a disconnect between the execu-tives, the cabinet and the senate. 
I will unify the A.S. Council  by pro-
viding a presidential focus on each and every position. I will meet with every councilmember and senator to really 
get a feel of how she or he is doing. I 
will redefine the scope of senator proj-ects to allow us to focus on these larger, common goals as groups or teams. 
We also need to work harder 
externally. I will work with our next Vice President of Student Life Ricsie Hernandez to ensure we have adequate and trained representation from all campuswide committees. I will work to reach out personally to the student body, with a monthly Y ouTube address and a quarterly newsletter.
I’ll institute a Fall Quarter annual 
opinion survey with the same mindset as that of the football survey — to use as a tool that both the A.S. Council and the administration can use in advocat-ing for your interests. I want to prove to you that your opinion matters, and that your representatives can be out there on Library Walk not only for your vote, but for your opinion.
I’m confident that if we work 
together as a unified student body, we can and will achieve our goals and truly make UCSD our campus.

Opinion Editor
A.S. COUNCIL —  Amid the bick-
ering and bubbly self-promotion of last week’s A.S. election, one promise from nearly every candidate was clear: A.S. councilmembers want to increase their communication with the general student body.
Of course, we’ve heard it all before. 
Y ear after year, candidates recognize the huge disconnect between the aver-age UCSD student and his or her stu-dent government; year after year, can-didates have pledged greater visibility and more direct interaction — only to shove that goal to the side once mid-terms and 14-hour council meetings start popping up. 
Take our current A.S. President 
Donna Bean, for example. When she ran for vice president of student life in 2007, she said she would reach out to student organizations by personally attending their meetings in order to strengthen their input to the council. The next year, in her unopposed bid for A.S. president, Bean underscored the fact that students still lack power over their programs, events and stu-dent life. Y et as her presidency nears an end, little has been done to reach out to the greater student body. Efforts have been stagnant, stopping at Facebook pages, posters and student forums — all of which require students to come to councilmembers.
M a n y  i d e a s  f r o m  t h i s  y e a r ’ s  c a n -
didates were similarly flawed. If done right, regularly updating the A.S. Web site, releasing Y ouTube addresses, distributing student surveys, writing newsletters and updating Facebook accounts would all be helpful steps toward a more connected student body — but these ideas must only be supple-mentary to face-to-face interactions. The reality is that most UCSD students are too distracted with academic and social concerns to actually pay atten-tion to the A.S. Council’s activities. 
Despite the $477,000 in student 
fees allocated by the A.S. Council to programming this year alone, a scanty 24.3 percent of students voted in the election. This apathy is exactly why A.S. representatives must spend more time seeking out students’ opinions  in the form of a Library Walk info table, weekly visits to student organizations and regular contact with college coun-cils. Still, new electees’ promises to A.S. visibility are missing something: the assurance that, once the year starts rolling, this priority won’t be thrown to the curb.
That’s why next year’s coun-
cil should create a student volunteer group whose sole responsibility would be to gather student input. If they’re promising a stronger A.S. presence on Library Walk, they could create a weekly schedule and assign slots to ensure someone will always be outside tabling. Individual volunteers could be assigned to different locations around campus (like dining halls or Geisel) and establish a relationship with stu-dents who hang out in their assigned areas. The students could be respon-sible for writing feedback reports every two weeks so the entire council can stay informed on the undergraduate population’s concerns.
Councilmembers who want to 
move forward with other technology-based ideas should assign specific indi-viduals to keep tabs on those avenues of communication, too. Between Feb. 23 and April 9, the only two posts on the A.S. Facebook page pertained to the elections. There was no mention of happenings in the university’s speech policy committee, the Literature Building cancer cluster or changes in the council’s standing rules, despite the significant council time spent on each. Even more alarming is how few stu-dents check the page in the first place. If it were one person’s job to recruit fans, facilitate discussions or post 
weekly summaries of council meet-ings, avenues like Facebook wouldn’t remain widely ignored. If online net-working is something candidates are banking on for increased student com-munication, it should be used right.
The average college student is sleep 
deprived and stressed out, and hardly wants to learn about his or her major, let alone campus politics. Nonetheless, next year’s councilmembers must aban-don the comfortable “if you build it they will come” attitude and start seek-ing out student input. Constructing a system of student outreach within the council infrastructure might not neces-sarily mean every student’s voice will be heard, but it’s a sure step to widening the council’s listening range.

858-454-2807Dear Editor,
Just before leaving office, the 
Bush administration eviscerated the 
central consultation process of the Endangered Species Act — exempt-ing greenhouse gas-emitting projects from regulation — and banned fed-eral agencies from protecting the polar bear from greenhouse gas emissions, the primary threat to its continued existence. These rules gut our nation’s most important wildlife protection law, and we’ve failed to use this law to fight the greatest future threat to endan-gered species — global warming.
On March 11, President Barack 
Obama signed into law an appro-priations bill giving Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar 60 days to rescind the Bush rules with the stroke of a pen and restore the Endangered Species Act to its former glory. As global citi-zens, we must urge Salazar to do what is right and take the first steps in repairing the environmental damage of the Bush administration by imme-diately rescinding the Endangered Species Act regulations by May 9. Call Salazar today at (202) 208-7351 and go to Savethepolarbear.org to send him a letter. The survival of endangered species across the planet depends on it.

On December 6, 2008, a team of under-
graduates launched 20 of the household pests 
into space. Upon returning to Earth, every one of them had survived the voyage, withstanding 
temperatures as low as minus 40 degrees, as well as the radiation and matter-less conditions in space.
The flight test was one of two hands-on design 
projects assigned last Fall Quarter in MAE 2 — an introductory course to aerospace engineering — by professors John Kosmatka and Keiko Nomura.
Every year, Kosmatka and Nomura include a 
technical design project on the course syllabus. Typically, it involves building small airplanes and flying them at campus locations such as RIMAC Field. But this year, Kosmatka and Nomura decided to include an additional project that would cater more to students’ interests.
“There are about 120 students in this course, 
and a third of them are more interested in space than aircraft, ” Kosmatka said.
The class, a prerequisite for the aerospace engi-
neering major, is largely composed of freshmen. While a lot of work is required for the new assign-ment, Kosmatka said the project was designed to press students into questioning their commitment to the field.
“It’s a hard major, and we really want them to 
become motivated as freshmen, ” Kosmatka said. “If they are inspired, then they are on the right track. ”
Kosmatka and Nomura said they gave students 
as much freedom as possible to design and study what they wanted within the project guidelines.
“I’m sure they were tired of me telling them 
what I thought was going on, ” Kosmatka said. “I wanted them to figure out for themselves what was happening. ”
Teaching assistants Andrew Cavendar and Zach 
Lovering also helped orchestrate the launch.
The faculty applied for sponsorship from the  
California Space Grant, which covered the total cost of the project — approximately $5,000. They also contacted the Federal Aviation Administration to make sure the project was within the FAA ’s legal airspace limits.
The 40-foot balloon contraption was composed 
of a series of four payloads, or boxes, each with a different function. The compartment at the lowest 
level contained two cameras with software rewritten 
by students to take photographs every 30 seconds, from both horizontal and vertical perspectives. The boxes were tethered to a large atmospheric weather balloon, 10 feet in diameter, with a deflated para-chute dangling just beneath it. 
As the balloon reached 85,000 feet — considered 
the edge of space — it expanded and eventually burst, at which point the parachute opened and gently brought the apparatus back down to the 
earth. The entire trip lasted two hours.
The 22 students selected for this project — cho-
sen from a class of 113 based on interest and past 
experience in ballooning, electronics fabrication, ALONG

METHOD ACTING
Above: Eleven min-
utes into the experi-ment, an infected cell (green) has attached itself to anuninfected cell.Below: At 29 min-
utes, the infection has spread to the new cell, and has already begun to take over the cell’s functions.
SETTING THE STAGE
Infected and uninfected cells are loaded into a live cell imaging chamber (clear tubes), then transferred onto the microscope and imaged with rapid, spinning-disk confo-cal microscopy.
Though it looks more like a radioactive piece of Flubber slowly forcing itself into some unsuspecting globular struc-ture, a new 37-second film clip — captured by researchers 
at UC Davis and the Mount Sinai School of Medicine — shows an HIV-infected T-cell spreading the virus to an uninfected T-cell. 
The footage proves that the process occurs through a viro-
logical synapse: a cell-to-cell adhesion that allows the virus to transfer without leaving the safety of cell membranes. 
A March 6 article in Science magazine challenged academics, 
industry specialists, patient advocates and government officials to cooperate in the search for a vaccine for the global killer; the video footage’s resulting report ran in the same publication on March 27.
When screened at an HIV conference this summer, the 
transfer elicited “audible gasps” from the audience, said Thomas Huser, associate professor and chief scientist at the UC Davis Center for Biophotonics Science and Technology.
“The filming of live cells was important because it allowed 
us to make very specific physical measurements with regard to the rate of transfer of viral proteins in the already infected cell, as well as in the newly infected target cells, ” Huser said. “This enables us to make more definitive conclusions about the nature of the virus transfer. It allows others to develop better models of the pathway of cell-cell transmission, and, of course, it created some stunning visual imagery, which should be eye opening to scientists and the wider public alike. ”
Highly active antiretroviral therapy — the current go-to 
drug cocktail designed to halt HIV replication — still has significant drawbacks. It is an expensive, lifelong prescription with long-term side effects in older HIV-positive patients that can include certain types of cancer, heart disease, liver disease and diabetes. 
Like Huser, many researchers believe that HIV treatments 
have reached a point where it is necessary to put treatment research on the back burner in favor of discovering a vaccine.
“Clearly one of the highest priorities of AIDS research, in 
addition to finding a cure, is to find an effective preventive vaccine, ” said Benjamin Chen, assistant professor  at the Mount 
Sinai School of Medicine. Chen’s laboratory created
 the green 
fluorescent virus technology, like a food coloring for cells, used to illuminate the cell-to-cell  transfer in the video.
Chen noted that the new evidence may assist researchers in 
creating an effective HIV vaccine, by emphasizing the need for antibodies that attack both modes of transmission — cell-to-cell along with the previously  accepted cell-free transmission 
through plasma. UCSD professor of pathology and medicine Douglas 
Richman — who also serves as director of the Center for AIDS Research at UCSD — said the goal of current HIV/AIDS research is to reduce the need for chronic suppressive therapy by eliminating the latent reservoir of HIV infection, the pool of infection that remains dormant.  However, this would demand 
additional know
ledge of possibly undiscovered HIV “reser-
voirs, ” as well as a greater understanding of HIV activities in the bloodstream. 
According to Chen the next goal is discovering how to stop 
the virus from spreading by using synapses, as well as develop-ment of a method to help the immune system produce signifi-cant amounts of HIV-blocking antibodies.
“We hope that this work will trigger significantly more 
work on the importance of direct cell-cell transmission for HIV , because we believe that this could be one of the rea-sons why current attempts at developing a vaccine have been unsuccessful because the viru s in essence hides inside cells, ” 
Huser said.
But shortages in research funding from the federal govern-
ment, coupled with a need for a full-time virologist — currently compensated for by Chen’s research group — might slow prog-ress. Other problems include the skeptical response of the HIV research community and the pharmaceutical industry.
Huser also realizes the problems researchers are faced with in 
attempts to cure the disease. 
“There are still many mysteries surrounding HIV spread, ” 
Huser said. “We don’t know if spread through direct cell-cell transfer is really the dominant mode for how the infection spreads in the body. At the current point, we can only hypoth-esize that it is.  There is also a big mystery surrounding the actual 
infection of target cells. We found that the virus in the target cell appears to be contained in a cellular compartment, similar to an endosome. We currently have no clue about how HIV is able to get out of this compartment. ” 
Scientists are still not overly optimistic when it comes to 
the future of HIV/AIDS research and vaccine discovery; they acknowledge several problems that hinder progress. One is time. Some, like Richman, believe that given the length of time required to complete other treatments, the process will be a tedious and slow-moving one that may not produce results for years, if not decades. 
“This virus is different from almost any other virus, ” Richman 
said. “There is so much antigenic variation that it will be difficult to create a vaccine for this. It’s going to be a long, hard struggle. ”

8855 Villa La Jolla Dr. Suite 402
La Jolla, CA 92037and hands-on building — divided 
themselves into six teams, each focusing on a different task. 
One team focused entirely on 
sending the weather balloon astro-nauts — cockroaches, planaria (small worms) and tardigrade, commonly known as water bears  
— into space. They wanted to test the creatures’ ability to cope with environmental stressors at extreme altitudes. 
The students tested the resistance 
of each species by placing them in a capsule with a variation of environ-mental constraints: Some chambers included heaters or air-activated hand warmers to compensate for subzero temperatures, while others were equipped with oxygen.
Another task force measured 
wind speed, humidity, pressure and temperature with altitude. One of the goals of this task force was to see whether solar-powered airplanes flown at each altitude the balloon reached could be a viable option in the future, Kosmatka said.
This group was also in charge 
of predicting where the apparatus would be able to land — given wind speed, extreme weather and other environmental factors — while avoiding the Salton Sea, U.S.  military 
territory and the Mexican desert. 
Fortunately, the balloon landed in the Imperial Sand Dunes — about 65 miles east of the launch.
According to Thurgood  Marshall 
College junior Casey Barrett, who was part of the team responsible for pre-testing the integrity of the con-tainers for space flight and landing, most of the six-week project was completed outside of class. Much of her team’s work was crammed into the week  preceding the launch. 
“[We] had to wait until all of the 
other teams figured out what they wanted to test and how they wanted to do it, ” Barrett said. “Then we had to design the structure and build the boxes. We had to work with every-one … It’s a lot of work, but it was a lot of fun as well. It was so rewarding to let go of the balloon. ”
Eleanor Roosevelt College junior 
David Hernandez-Ibarra said the project was unlike any other he has been assigned. 
“This was a trial project, but I 
really hope [the professors] try it again in the future, ” he said. 
The balloon apparatus will be 
reconstructed and exhibited in Price Center East for a month during Spring Quarter, with the parachute open above the payload boxes to symbolize the descent — and success — of the project.

to end the third. 
UCSD could not retain the momen-
tum from its third-quarter surge, giv-
ing up three unanswered goals to the Wolverines to start the final period. With the game well out of reach, Gstettenbauer scored the final UCSD goal, making the final score 10-6.
On Thursday night, the Tritons 
faced rival Loyola Marymount University; UCSD defeated the Lions decisively at their home pool on the Lions’  Senior Day last year.
“That’s my fondest memory of this 
team, ” Gstettenbauer said. “They were so cocky going into that game and then we beat them pretty good. ”
Despite the strong performance in last year’s match, the Tritons knew that this game would be a new fight.
UCSD came out blazing, tak-
ing a 4-1 lead after the first quarter. Gstettenbauer  and junior two-meter 
Stephanie Heinrich scored back-to-back  goals in the opening minutes. 
The Lions scored three unanswered goals in the second quarter to tie the game. The lapse woke up the Tritons’ top performers — Gstettenbauer and Heinrich — who took over the come-back attempt, quickly scoring twice. A controversial LMU buzzer beater cut UCSD’s lead to one at the end of the half.
To break out of the second half, 
both teams fought hard before LMU  
netted consecutive goals to take the 8-7 lead. But Bloom scored her second goal of the quarter to tie the game. UCSD struck first in the final period; Heinrich scored her fourth goal of the game. But the Lions returned with three straight goals to take the lead and finish the game 11-9. 
“We have a really young team, ” 
Sanders said. “They pass well, but they need to learn when to take the open shot ... and that’s just going to come with more experience. ”
UCSD prepares to face Chapman 
University on April 17 before traveling to San Diego State University in hopes of avenging a previous 16-6 loss.

pitcher Lauren Chastain’s first home 
run of the season — a three-run shot.
“I think we were just seeing the ball 
really well, ” Habib said. “Obviously it showed in our hitting. ”
The Coyotes responded with a 
three-run blast of their own in the second, making the score 4-3.
With UCSD up 6-3 in the fifth, the 
Coyotes scored twice, cutting the Triton lead to one. However, UCSD continued to hit the long ball, and Habib’s tower-ing home run in the bottom of the fifth gave the Tritons a 7-5 lead.
Down by two, the Coyotes scored 
a run in the sixth, and threatened to take the lead with two runners on base. Granath came in from the bullpen to extinguish the fire, by striking out the next batter and inducing a groundout before pitching a flawless seventh.
“It’s where I want to be all the time 
— the crisis situations are always the best, ” Granath said. “ And when good things happen it’s even better. ”
Unfortunately, UCSD came up short in the second game of the dou-bleheader. The Coyotes took a 4-0 lead through three-and-a-half innings before junior catcher Nicole Saari’s two-run single helped cut the deficit to one.
UCSD rallied in the seventh as 
senior outfielder Megan Grace smashed an RBI triple, making it 7-5. Sophomore catcher Nicole Monroe hustled to first base for an RBI single, but UCSD was unable to finish the rally.
“We lost from poor defensive play, ” 
Gerckens said. “Our infield just didn’t get some routine ground balls, didn’t communicate on some pop flies, did not take the bunt away from them. ”
During the first game of the Senior 
Day doubleheader on April 11, the UCSD lineup left nine runners on base. The offensive struggles peaked in the fifth inning, with the team down 5-1. The Tritons loaded the bases, but didn’t bring anyone home.
“We all want to be in those situa-
tions and we all want to come out big for our team, ” assistant coach Bridget McKay said. “Sometimes the balls just 
don’t fall and you just don’t get the hits. ”
The UCSD pitching gave up 11 hits 
in the 7-1 Coyote  victory.
In the doubleheader’s back end, the 
Tritons mustered only three hits, fail-ing to score and falling 2-0 to Cal State San Bernardino.
Chastain, who leads all Triton 
pitchers in wins and strikeouts, kept UCSD in the game, allowing only two runs through seven innings. With the Coyotes up 1-0 in the sixth, Chastain stranded two runners with a critical strikeout to escape the inning.
“I was hoping that we could use 
the momentum and take it into the seventh and score a couple of runs to win the game, ” Chastain said.
After the disappointing series, 
UCSD is now fourth in the CCAA and must hold on to that fourth spot to make the playoffs. UCSD’s next series is against second-place Cal State Dominguez Hills April 17 and 18.

VOLLEYBALL — On the verge of playoff elimina-
tion, No. 10 UCSD (12-14, 8-13 Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation) had a rollercoaster weekend at RIMAC Arena against No. 3 Cal State Northridge  
and No. 13 UC Santa Barbara. The Tritons nearly forced a fifth set on April 10, before falling in four to the Matadors. UCSD then defeated UCSB on April 11 in five sets, keeping playoff hopes alive.
“With CSUN we stayed down for a little 
too long, but we came back against UCSB and finished strong, ” senior middle blocker Gerald Houseman said.
After Friday’s loss to the Matadors, the Tritons 
found themselves in a must-win situation on Saturday against UCSB (8-18, 4-17 MPSF) with UCSD’s first-ever postseason berth on the line. Playing most of Saturday’s game from behind, the Tritons eventually overcame the early deficit, taking the five-set victory.
UCSD won the first set, hitting at a .423 clip 
compared to the Gauchos’ .148. Holding on to a slim lead, the Tritons widened their advantage margin to 24-20 on the backs of Fritsch and Houseman, leading to a 30-26 win.
After a kill from junior opposite hitter Jason 
Spangler opened the second set, the Gauchos went on a scoring spree, sending down 10 straight points and ultimately taking the set 30-21.
The third set wasn’t much of an improvement 
for the Tritons, as they were coming off a set in which they hit for a negative percentage. After trailing by five early on, UCSD rallied to come within two points. However, UCSB went on an 8-3 run, putting the set out of reach for the Tritons.
UCSD finally showed life in set four, when a 
block from Houseman and sophomore setter Phil Bannan combined with two Fritsch kills broke a tie and gave the Tritons a 24-20 lead. UCSD forced a fifth set after redshirt sophomore outside hitter Will Ehrman sent down the match point.
The Tritons took an 8-6 lead in the fifth set 
after a service error before the Gauchos stormed back, tying the score at 11. A UCSD attack error gave the Gauchos a 12-11 lead, but the Tritons immediately answered on a Fritsch kill to tie it at 12 before a UCSB attack error put the Tritons back on top. UCSB tied it again at 13, but another Gaucho attack error and an Ehrman kill  ended 
the game and match at a 15-13 UCSD advantage.
“The UCSB game was kind of up and down 
for us playing wise, but we were able to turn it around in the fourth and fifth game when it counted and came out with the win, ” Bannan said.
Fritsch led the Tritons with 21 kills, while 
Ehrman added 16 kills and 10 digs. Sophomore middle blocker Calvin Ross and Houseman added nine kills each. Houseman and Ross had eight blocks apiece while Phil Bannan recorded seven blocks, six digs and 56 assists.
Friday night, the Tritons gave the Cal State 
Northridge Matadors (22-5, 15-5 MPSF) a battle to remember on their home court. In the game, the Tritons were barely outhit: .276 to .261. Fritsch sent down 26 kills and Spangler added 22 kills as UCSD nearly forced a fifth set. The fourth set featured 21 ties and 10 lead changes. 
After taking the first set, Cal State Northridge  
carried an early 10-8 lead in the second.
UCSD then went on an 11-4 tear, making 
the score 19-14. With a tied score at 28, Cal State Northridge took the lead on a kill. Spangler 
answered back with a kill of his own and two Cal State Northridge errors gave UCSD the win.
Cal State Northridge  dominated the third set 
early before the Tritons rallied to cut the deficit to two. The Matadors quickly fenced off UCSD, 
closing the door on the set with a 10-4 run.
In the seesaw grudge match that was the 
fourth set, both teams served for the win; it was a never-ending story, going back and forth multiple times. Following a UCSD service error, a Matador block finally ended the match at 38-36.
The Tritons will play again on Friday night at 
RIMAC against Cal State Long Beach.
“I think we might have a chance still to make 
playoffs depending on how other teams finish up their seasons, ” Bannan said. “So we will have to wait and see how that turns out. ”

WATER POLO — With the season 
winding down, the Tritons, who played their final home game and faced their archrival in back-to-back contests last week, would have preferred a hap-pier finish. In an outstanding matchup against No. 11 Loyola Marymount University on April 9, the Tritons  fell 
short of an upset by just four and a half minutes. UCSD then faced No. 13 University of Michigan on Senior Day, aggressively attacking the Wolverines throughout the match before Michigan snagged the victory in the fourth quar-ter.
Throughout the season, the Tritons 
have battled through inexperience at key positions, but on Saturday UCSD’s veteran players were faced with the task of dealing with strong emotions. 
“It feels weird, ” senior captain 
Sydney Gstettenbauer said of her final home game. “It doesn’t really feel like I’m leaving. We still have some games left so it’s not like it’s really over yet. ”
The Wolverines relentlessly shut 
down Gstettenbauer, who has been UCSD’s top performer this season. The attacker scored her only goal of the game in its closing seconds — long after the outcome had been decided.
Both teams played a tight game 
through much of the contest; a per-formance lapse in the second quarter was the Tritons’ undoing. From the get go, the game looked to be a defensive matchup, with neither offense clicking in the first quarter. The University of Michigan finally scored with 1:51 left in the first on a shot that just barely crawled through the posts. Sophomore utility Nadine Shnayderman returned 
the favor, scoring a Triton goal with 40 seconds left in the quarter. 
Both teams scored back-to-back  
goals to start the second period before 
Michigan went on a four-goal run, tak-ing a 6-2 halftime lead.
“When they take out our best 
scorer, the other players need to find opportunities to make shots, ” head 
coach Larry Sanders said. “The open-
ings are there because the defense is focusing on [Gstettenbauer] and someone needs to find that open shot. ”
The Tritons took that advice to 
heart in the third quarter, netting the first two goals — by senior two-meter defender Rebecca Gearty and junior attacker Audra Bloom — and cutting the Michigan lead to 6-4. Michigan scored again, but sophomore attacker Hanalei Crowell answered with a goal

SOFTBALL — UCSD dropped four 
out of five games last week, in its last homestand of the season. Now, the 
Tritons must hold on to fourth place 
in the California Collegiate Athletic Association to make the playoffs.
Having won eight of their last 11 
games, the Tritons looked more than ready for their final five home games against University of San Diego on April 8, and doubleheaders against Cal State San Bernardino April 10 and 11. 
UCSD got off to a rough start, with 
USD taking a 5-0 lead during the top 
of the first inning. Freshman start-ing pitcher Tess Granath gave up four hits and the Triton defense committed three errors in the first inning.
“We definitely changed a lot of peo-
ple around in the lineup, ” head coach Patti Gerckens said. “Our catcher [against USD] usually plays first base. ”
After sophomore outfielder Kristyn 
Lesovsky hit an RBI single in the fifth, 
USD struck back with a three-run 
home run, taking an 8-1 lead.
Down by seven, the Tritons rallied 
in the seventh inning, but were only able to put four runs on the score-board, ultimately falling 8-5. 
After the loss, UCSD set its sights 
on its final home series of the season, a four-game set with the Coyotes.
UCSD struck first, producing four 
runs on three hits, including senior
