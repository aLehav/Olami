After years of financial strife, the newly 
renovated Grove Cafe opened its doors again 
last week, offering free lunch to over 2,200 UCSD students in an attempt to recruit future business for the struggling cafe.
The Grove, an A.S. enterprise, hosted a 
four-day free lunch event that took place from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., Tuesday through Friday. Despite the drizzly weather, thousands of stu-dents waited in line to receive a free sandwich or personal pizza. 
According to Vice President of Finances and Resources Peter Benesch, an estimated $6,000 was spent on the promotion event, including ingredients and advertising.
Associate Vice President of Enterprise 
Operations Rishi Ghosh called the kickoff a 
“smashing success. ”
“We have captured a huge chunk of campus 
awareness about the Grove, and that has been our main goal, ” Ghosh said. 
The Grove opened in 1986 as part of the 
Crafts Center — run by director Ron Carlson — and used its status as the only coffee shop on campus to keep students coming back.
In 1993, however, the Student Center venue 
began losing business to the brand-new Price Center, sinking the cafe into debt and forcing Carlson to sell his 50-percent share to the A.S. Council in 2007.
When profits continued to drop under stu-
dent management, the council decided to hire a professional manager for $50,000 a year.
Benesch said this decision was the main 
contributor to the Grove’s current $140,000 debt. 
“The only reason the Grove was bleeding 
money the last two years was because of the manager’s salary, ” Benesch said. “We could not support a $50,000-a-year position. It was a poor,

The A.S. Council’s  Wednesday meeting 
will have a few extra visitors this week, when 
representatives from student publications — including the Muir Quarterly , the Koala  and 
Mania Magazine — will turn out to protest the passage of new “media guidelines” that would require each publication to be sponsored by a university representative.
According to A.S. Director of Media 
Relations Rose Eveleth, student organizations are concerned that the proposal would restrict the growth of new magazines and newspapers across campus, and that the introduction of mandatory staff oversight could pose a serious threat to free speech.

Students applying for freshman admission to one 
or more UC campuses in Fall 2010 will be the first to face a new waitlisting procedure.
The university is planning to implement waitlists 
for admission, in hopes of curbing overenrollment. Waitlisted students will be notified in March, and the final admission decision will arrive after May 1. 
According to Debora Obley, associate vice presi-
dent for budget operations in the UC Office of the President, the UC system currently contains about 200,000 stu-dents, and is overenrolled by approxi-mately 15,000 — increasing the student-faculty ratio and straining resources. 
Obley said the university received $4 
billion in state funding for the 2009-10 academic year, the same amount available in 2006-07, despite growing demand. 
“In 2006-07, we had about 20,000 fewer students, ” 
Obley said. “ And at that time, we thought we were underfunded. ”
Director of Undergraduate Admissions Susan 
Wilbur said that by placing students on the waitlist instead of offering them admission, there is a reduced chance of having a high yield rate, which leads to overenrollment.
“We expect that UC campuses will admit a suf-
ficient number of applicants to reach their enrollment targets, but [the] yield is not always predictable, ” Wilbur said. “Let’s say, for example, that a campus comes up short of its target. A waitlist allows the campus to offer a place to additional students in a controlled way — that is, to an appropriate number of

Researchers from UCSD and the 
National Institutes of Health have 
discovered a protein that could help treat hearing impairments. 
The protein, called Sox2, is 
critical in the formation of spinal ganglion neurons — the auditory neurons mammals use to hear.
The leading cause of acquired 
hearing impairment in the ear is either the loss of hair cells in the inner ear or spiral ganglion neurons.
Dr. Alain Dabdoub, an assis-
tant professor of surgery at UCSD, helped conduct a two-year study using the Sox2 protein to create these spiral ganglion neurons in the ear tissue of mice. The study was recently published in the Jan. 13 issue of The Journal of Neuroscience.
Researchers removed developing 
ear tissue from mouse embryos and studied the effects of injecting the cells with the Sox2 protein.  
They used immunohistochem-
istry — a procedure that stains proteins using visual markers such as fluorescent dye — to differentiate the Sox2 protein, then introduced the protein to the ear cells through infection (a process known as elec-troporation).  
According to 
Dabdoub, within two days of mixing the cochlear and Sox2 pro-teins together, the cells that were injected with the Sox2 gene devel-oped into neurons and survived for up to two weeks. In contrast, cells that were not injected with the Sox2 gene did not become neurons.
“Utilizing genetics, we showed 
that Sox2 is necessary for the for-mation of spiral ganglion neurons, as these neurons are absent in Sox2 mutant mice — revealing a novel role for Sox2 in ear development, ” Dabdoub said. 
Currently, the most common 
therapies for hearing loss are hearing aids — which essentially increase hair-cell stimulation — or cochlear implants that act as an electronic substitute for the hair cells.
In both forms of treatment, nor-
mal spiral ganglion neurons must be intact for the treatment to be effec-tive. For this reason, this discovery that Sox2 proteins create new nerves is promising for future advance-ments in hearing restoration.  
The study, which ini-
tially began at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, is being carried out in Dr. Dabdoub’s laboratory in the UCSD School of Medicine, Division of Otolaryngology. 
“This induction has significant 
implications for clinical research 
related to cochlear implants, ” he said. “The ability to replace damaged or lost neu-rons with new cells through gene therapy would provide a substantial benefit to those suffering from hearing impairment. ”

with the ear tissue of mice embryos to regrow essential hearing neurons.

Senior Staff WriterLIGHTS  AND SIRENS
ing the proposal in November, insist-ed that the main purpose of the media guidelines would be to “enhance” the quality of campus publications by way of faculty connections.
Many others — particularly, Koala  
editor in chief Kris Gregorian — see the proposal as a way to try and cut funding for the Koala .
In September, the 
Koala  published a con-
troversial article about UCSD student Leon Roach, who died over the summer in a pole-vaulting accident. Several councilmem-bers attempted to pass a resolution that would cut funding for the Koala , 
but were discouraged by other members worried the interjection would infringe on free speech.
“[The proposal is] 
definitely directed at the Koala , ” Gregorian said. 
“What is the purpose of this? What is its benefit? They’ve tried to get rid of us in the past, and this is just a sneakier way to do it. ”
Eveleth, who helped draft the pro-
posal, agreed with Gregorian.
“The purpose of the legislation is 
to get rid of the Koala , ” Eveleth said. 
“The A.S. Council will try to tell you otherwise, but I’m not buying it. ”
Gregorian said that when he and his 
staff heard about the new guidelines, their first move was to obtain a faculty sponsor — Fred Driscoll of the UCSD physics department.
Ang denied the proposal was 
drafted in an attempt to cut the Koala ’s funds.
“This is not about the Koala ; this 
is not about any other magazine, ” Ang said. “Maybe this came at a time when, you know, what the Koala  did — 
maybe this came at that same time. But these media guidelines have not been touched in years … We want to make sure that we’re covering our grounds, and that everything is addressed. ”
However, in an e-mail sent by 
Ang to councilmembers on Jan. 21, he wrote that the proposal was in response to unnamed “incidents” that occurred during Fall Quarter.
According to Gregorian, vari-
ous legal organiza-tions — including the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education and the Student Press Law Center — have voiced disapproval of the proposal, and have confirmed it could pose a threat to free speech.
“Just because 
they pass a law that isn’t obviously cen-sorship [because it] applies to everybody, if it’s targeted at a specific organiza-
tion, then it’s definitely considered cen-sorship, ” Gregorian said.
Drafted by Ang, Campuswide 
Senator Adam Kenworthy, Campuswide Senator Tobias Haglund, Revelle Senator Jaclyn Storey and Marshall Senator Brian McEuen, the guidelines would require every campus media organization to obtain “spon-sorship” from a college, academic department or nonacademic depart-ment like the Alumni Association.
After the arrangement was signed 
off by a department chair or college dean, a faculty member would serve in an “advisory” capacity to the student organization. In return, the depart-ment would be allowed a one-page, A.S.-funded advertisement.
Student publications unable to 
secure a departmental sponsor would no longer be eligible to receive funds from the A.S. Council.
According to Ang, a faculty advisor would be an asset to any publication, and could help students obtain quotes and information from university staff more easily — thus improving relations between student publications and the administration.
Though Kenworthy — who helped 
draft the proposal — said he has reser-vations about the legislation in its cur-rent form, he agreed that departmental resources could benefit smaller publi-cations in need of guidance. 
“The whole idea is to sort of 
enrich the quality of reporting, ” Kenworthy said. “We have a lot of magazines that would do well to pair with departments. ”
However, Kenworthy expressed 
hesitations 
According to Eveleth, several 
organizations — as well as potential faculty representatives — are con-cerned that the stipulation would infringe upon free speech at UCSD. 
“ All the [faculty] I’ve talked to have 
expressed that they’re worried about this legislation. Not only from a free-dom-of-speech position — in terms of how a department head is going to want some kind of oversight over what they’re signing off on and sponsoring — but also from a logistics standpoint, ” Eveleth said. “There is not a single [organization] that is supporting it. ”
In an anonymous Fall Quarter 
survey sent out by Eveleth to 21 publications on campus, students expressed concern over the A.S. Council’s  proposed intervention.
“With regard to staff oversight, 
I believe that student publications are not intended to represent anyone but the people publishing it, ” one anonymous response read. “We exist so that we can express ourselves fully. If we can’t, then we may as well stop publishing. Moreover, I believe that this right extends to all publications, regardless of content. ”
Ang said such concerns are

It’s been a strange week. 
Trees fell. Drivers panicked. 
DSW sold out of rubber boots 
in almost every size. A girl in my 
history class even claimed victory in nature’s greatest wet T-shirt contest. 
The source of so much commo-

Where a bad forecast usually means you just need to wear closed-toed shoes — not boots fashioned out of school bus-yellow rubber and a huge pon-cho (the Southern California equiva-lent of a Hazmat suit).

untested San Diego natives and those used to heavy downpour, too — were so ill-equipped to deal with an inch of rain isn’t much of a surprise. It’s not often we have to make a slip-pery sprint to Center Hall wearing common-room trash bags. Even in the frigid, sub-70-degree weeks of January, our heavy coats don’t usually get much action. 
But what’s most alarming isn’t 
the fact that we don’t know how to respond when the forecast prohibits T-shirts and sandals; it’s just how sulky we become at the sight of that first dewy raindrop. 
Y ou might think that, in a desert 
where we seldom get any closer to rainfall than a “Sound of Music” rerun, we’ d be excited enough by the prospect of an authentic winter to run barefoot from our dorms out onto the pavement — heads tilted backward, tongues out, to taste God and global warming’s gift to the world — but if the past week’s wide-spread helplessness is any indicator, that’s clearly not the case. 
And maybe for good reason. 
Last week, in the five exasperating minutes it took to beat the elements from the Sunshine Market to the top of the Literature Building, I went from feeling great about scoring a 50-cent breakfast bar (to whoever thought to stuff all the saturated fat of a Cinnabon roll in a five-inch wrapper for mass consumption: you’re what I call a hero) to dab-bing the inside of my shoe with a dwindling supply of paper towels and cursing the Lit Building for not being evacuated. 
In any event, I was in no posi-

And that I did. (Well, almost — I 
can’t be certain of the correlation, though after a dozen or two plays of “Fuck and Run, ” I suspect my facial-hair growth may have slowed.) 
A couple days of grilled-cheese

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA  —  Last week, the UC Board of 
Regents announced that freshman applicants will be placed on waitlists for the first time beginning Fall 2010. Their reasoning: Over-enrollment at the nine undergraduate campuses must be curbed.
Although waiting an extra month or two for a final decision will be 
stressful for all those on the waitlist, the new admission method will allow for a few more students to squeeze into otherwise-wasted spots — a more solid variable for a system dangerously stretched past its maxi-mum capacity. 
UCSD saw a 2.3-percent increase in applications from Fall 2009 to 
Fall 2010. Even more devastating was a 4.3-percent rise in applicants systemwide. It’s obvious we’ve got some serious overpopulation problems <PMZMOMV\[IZMWXMVQVO_IQ\TQ[\[\W[WN\MV\PMJTW_WNN]Z\PMZ MVZWTTUMV\K]\[¸I_Q[MUW^MQN\PMa¼ZM\WUIQV\IQV

At first glance, Obama’s Race to the Top ini-tiative is handing schools a seamless short-
cut to more cash, but in reality, many states — empty-pocketed California, in particular — has no chance of winning these awards. 
With the current economic crisis at hand, 
California is in no fiscal state to spend extra time raising low-income students’ test scores and amping up specialized teacher-student interaction — all the expensive preparations necessary to receive Obama’s stamp of approval and pocket one of the Race to the Top grants. 
Only 10 to 20 states will receive the 
grants in the first round of awards, and we can already surmise that California will, by default, be stampeded by more financially stable competitors who can actually undergo preliminary reforms.
With $18 billion in cuts accumulating from 
the last two years alone, our state is irrevocably damaged — or at least sunk to a level that’s out of the initiative’s reach. Not only is there no dollar-stuffed cushions to secure our jump into “better” education, but there is also very little motivation from disgruntled California teachers — who have to endure furlough days and pay cuts — to clean up the government’s mess. 
With additional pressure from schools, these 
peeved educational employees are forced to bolster their students’ performances in class so their institutions can be saved. 
For many, this seems a hopeless task 
that will simply eat up time, energy and money. 
So next time, Obama, try to make the 
game easier for those with a disadvantage on the playing field. California is the tortoise here — and slow and steady will not win the race.

President Obama’s newly proposed Race to the Top competition among schools on the 
national scale would offer an initial $4 billion  
stipend for education, in an attempt to close the achievement gap. 
Thousands of school districts in California, 
Ohio and Michigan have refused to join the race. 
One of the only reasons that school districts have declined to participate is that they are concerned with the possible ramifications of its requirements. While Race to the Top asks for full state involve-ment, individual districts are allowed to opt out without sabotaging their entire state’s eligibility. 
But while there is no guarantee that Obama’s 
race will prove successful, there’s absolutely no harm in trying.
Should particular districts find they can’t keep 
up with the race’s requirements, they are not obli-gated to continue. So then the question becomes, why not? At best, Race to the Top  provides the 
opportunity for California to receive $700 million 
in federal aid. At worst, California would be 
right back where it is right now.
More than ever before, 
California needs as much 
funding as it can get for 
education. We’re cur-
rently ranked 48th 
for education in the 
entire country. 
The race’s $700 
million won’t 
do anything but 
help a little. It’s time to lace up our shoes and hit the track.

Associate 
Opinion Editor  On Jan. 19, president Barack Obama requested $1.3 billion in additional funding for his 
$4.3-billion Race to the Top program — an incentive-based program aimed at improving K-12 schools by creating a nationwide competition for the best standardized testing scores. Though the reward would provide some schools more fund-ing — and how can you argue against that — such high monetary stakes might lead them to make hasty, superficial classroom decisions.
Obama’s objectives are certainly admirable. 
In order to qualify for the program, states must increase the frequency of their teacher evaluations, build data systems to measure student improvement and increase the amount of charter schools. 
So the game is on, and Obama’s new request for 
funding may add more cash to the competition’s jackpot. State education administrators are enrolling in contest-preparation sessions. State legislatures are scrambling to rewrite education laws. As practically every state struggles to bolster its budget, all involved have their eyes on the prize. 
This will not allow schools to put enough 
thought into complex and potentially life-changing curriculum changes. Rick Hess, an education policy analyst with the American Enterprise Institute, expressed worry that Obama is rushing states to alter their system rules. “We’re institutionalizing impatience, ” he told USA Today  
on Nov. 4. “There’s not much room for thoughtful conversation. ”
While some states may benefit from the Race 
to the Top program, the nature of the competition guarantees that many will enter and few will win. In the process, the changes that states make to their schools may be careless and have unintended consequences. The U.S. government needs to think twice before it turns American education into a hyper-competitive game show.

OPINION MONDAY , JANUARY 25, 2010  THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 
Is Internet porn the “crack cocaine of sexual addiction”? The porn industry nets 100 
billion a year and is considered the norm in mainstream media. Is this harmless entertainment changing the way we view ot hers and ourselves? In light of our 
cultures interest in sex and its affects [i.e. TV shows: Sex Rehab with Dr. Drew, Oprah doing an upcoming television event on sex addiction, Girls Gone Wild’s popularity, the local Koala Club, etc….], our club Real Life, would like to host a nationally known speaker on the affects of sexual addiction in  his life. His name is Michael Leahy and his 
presentation is called Porn Nation.
Michael Leahy, author of Porn Nation - the Naked Truth and prominent guest on 
Playboy Radio, ABC’s 20/20, the View, CNN, Fox News, and USA Today, is here to talk 
with us about the issue. Leahy will share facts about the porn industry, its effects on 
society, relationships and his personal journey with pornography. His story is a 
redemptive tale of struggle, ruin, loss and fa ith. He holds nothing back in sharing his 
spiritual journey of faith that sheds new light on his views on porn as well as the pains 
and joys of his porn addiction.
He is the founder of a grassroots social justice organization that is addressing the 
issues of pornography, prostitution, and sex trafficking around the world.Come join us for this important discussion!Dear Editor,
What if we lived in a world where 
your cell-phone carrier raised your 
bill and, at the same time, reduced your coverage? What if your landlord increased your rent by a third and then took away your bathroom? What if you took a flight and the airline raised the price while in midair?
These seem like ridiculous scenar-
ios, but something similar is happen-ing all across UC campuses right now.
The cost of your education is sky-
rocketing just as students are forced to endure overcrowded classrooms — due to the all-too-common predica-ment of full enrollment rosters and reduced course offerings.
If only papers and finals were the 
worst of your worries.
In the span of this next year, the 
UC Regents will raise your fees by over 30 percent, after more than dou-bling them in the last 10 years. When you speak out about these injustices, the best that administrators can do is blame Sacramento for disinvesting in the University of California — and then look to private funding sources.
And while it is true that public 
sources of funding for education have diminished due to state budget woes, the story is not that simple. The majority of California legisla-tors know that California should be investing in its students and future workforce, not abandoning them and putting up even more barriers to a quality education.
That is why I have proposed that 
we adequately fund our community colleges, state colleges and univer-sities by requiring oil companies to pay their fair share for the oil and natural gas they pump out of California’s land and water. We can no longer afford to be the only major oil-producing state that doesn’t levy such a fee. Texas, for instance, gener-ates $400 million for higher educa-tion through a similar fee.
My bill, AB 656, would raise up to 
$2 billion for the UC, CSU and com-munity colleges with a 12.5-percent tax on oil extracted within California. That’s considerably less than the 25-percent tax levied in Sarah Palin’s Alaska. The oil companies will tell you that they already pay enough taxes, and that this bill will result in jobs lost. Y et oil companies have been experiencing record-breaking profits for the past several years. Exxon Mobil, for instance, raked in a $45.2-billion profit in 2008, the most ever made by a publicly traded U.S. company.
The UC system is crucial to our 
state’s economy. It generates billions of dollars in economic activity and attracts billions more in research dol-lars, money that fuels key industries like agriculture, energy and biotech-nology.
With big oil ready to spend lav-
ishly to defeat AB 656, this won’t be an easy fight — but it’s a fight I’m confident we can win together. Please join me and thousands of other con-cerned Californians in fighting for higher education at www.facebook.

A seasoned hypo-
chondriac, there was only one place for me to turn: the Internet. 
I shortly found 
that there’s a common medical designation for what may or may not have reduced me to an under-the-cover Cheez-It binge — one with an acronym that couldn’t have been more spot-on: Seasonal Affective Disorder. 
According to the trusted experts at WebMD.com and Wikipedia, I more than fit the bill. Between the ages of 15 and 55? Check. Feeling 
sad, grumpy, moody or anxious when there’s no sunshine? Quadruple check. By the time I scrolled down to the bit about craving carbohy-drates, I needed no fur-ther convincing: I was sick — ill, really — and for all the Parmesan and garlic Cheez-Its I could stomach, no treatment but a sunny afternoon 
could heal me. 
Thankfully, this is Southern 
California — where, I am convinced, no week can pass without a fresh sunburn (for a ginger, anyway) — and by Saturday, I was healed. The clouds parted, the debris cleared and I finally got my hands on a meal consisting of more than three-week-old bread and melted cheese. 
But for those couple days that 
my fellow hypochondria/SAD-afflicted peers and I were forced to take refuge at home, the end of the world one violent gust away, it occurred to me that maybe the reason they call it El Niño is that only a sugar-addicted toddler can match the terror of a violent storm. Wikipedia begs to differ, but I don’t care. No one really believes those pages, anyway.

well-qualified students who applied 
but were not originally offered a space. ” 
This would help the university 
accurately enroll the number of stu-dents it is funded to support. The exact number of students to be placed on waitlists has not been determined, though UC Vice President for Budget  and Capital Resources Patrick Lens estimated 1,000. 
UC Irvine experimented with 
a pilot waitlist program this fall. Approximately 700 applicants were offered a spot on the waitlist in March 2009, and one-half decided to accept.
“Following receipt of the 
Statement of Intent to Register forms on May 1, Irvine found that it had some space to admit additional stu-dents, ” Wilbur said. “The campus decided to offer a space to all students on its waitlist. ”
Joshua Kim, a junior at Oxford 
Academy High School, said that although the new waitlists will not influence his UC application deci-sions, the plan is a good idea.
“The waitlists can’t hurt anyone, ” 
Kim said. “I’ d rather be told I’m on their waitlists than get rejected. Regardless, I’m still going to apply to the four or five UC [campuses] I want to go to. ”
The committee has yet to deter-
mine which UC campuses will imple-ment waitlists. 
“It is voluntary, however, and 
individual UC campus participation is optional, ” Wilbur said. “But the conversations are serious, and the 
probability of implementing a waitlist strategy is very high. ”
The com-
mittee is in the process of work-ing out potential complications, such as deciding whether or not a student can be on multiple lists. Specific details regarding coor-dination of the process are still in the works.

The Grove’s debt is borrowed from 
the university, and does not currently affect the A.S. Enterprise budget.
“Technically, if the Grove kept 
a steady level of debt indefinitely, it would be more advantageous to keep it open, ” Benesch said. “If the Grove was closed, the debt would have to be paid off. It makes sense to break even. We would accept it, but ideally we want profitability. ” 
A.S. President Utsav Gupta made 
“saving” the Grove a main point of his platform during the election season last year. When Gupta began his term, he removed the professional manager, aiming to revert to a more student-oriented business model.
“The previous administration 
didn’t put focus on the Grove, ” Gupta said. “Instead of taking responsibility for the debt, they were blaming the responsibility on the Grove, and tried to remove it. ”
The latest changes to the cafe 
include a simplified menu — offering simple, easy foods like sandwiches and breakfast items — with the intention of becoming the most affordable eatery on campus. Everything on the menu sells for under $5, and coffee is $1, one of the cheapest prices on campus.
“I’m trying to cut costs to make the 
food more accessible, so undergradu-ate students will come to the Grove, ” Grove Student Manager Thomas Frank said. “While it is great to have graduate students, researchers and professors coming to the Grove, it’s stupid to not target the students that are on this campus each day. ” 
Last quarter, the Grove was par-
tially closed for renovations such as repainting, installing black tile floors, creating new menus and purchas-ing a $3,700 convection toaster oven. University Centers also paid to redo the deck and add more lighting. 
“With internal and external 
reforms, we can make the Grove prof-itable right now, ” Ghosh said. “I think realistically, within the next two years, the Grove can have its debt paid off. ”
If the Grove goes further into debt, 
University Centers has the authority to terminate the Grove’s lease, forcing its $140,000 debt to be paid off.
Eleanor Roosevelt College fresh-
man Audris Fan, who attended the grand reopening, said she waited 40 minutes for a free personal pizza. 
“The bites I had were pretty good, 
but I felt like it’s not worth it to return to the Grove, ” Fan said.
Sixth College senior Leena Barakat 
said she frequented the Grove before the changes, but approves of the reno-vations.

the best foods I’ve had on campus, ” Barakat said. “It’s in a nice location, and the prices are really good. I will come back for sure. ”

“There have been arguments about 
free speech, but I really don’t see how this relates to free speech, ” Ang said. “We’re not telling them what they can write [or] what they can’t write. And the advisors, the university employees, will be there to just advise them — to help them better their writing. ”
Kenworthy said he participated 
in the drafting of the proposal due to his concern over the A.S. Council’s responsibility to spend student fees on quality publications that reflect the desires of the student body. 
“Y ou have two sides to the argu-
ment, ” Kenworthy said. “Y ou have one side that says, you have to allow free speech in all its forms … [But] on the other hand … if we put student money toward something that students don’t want on this campus, then that’s not very responsible of us.  Whether or 
not, legally, we’re responsible for what’s published, we still fund it, and I think that’s a burden on us. There was just a call to have a higher standard of the quality of what’s published. ” 
According to Eveleth, who met with 
the editors of several different newspa-pers and magazines, students are wor-ried that the proposal could be an addi-tional roadblock  for new publications. 
“They’re all very concerned that 
it’s going to make it much more diffi-cult for them to function as a publica-tion, and some of them… are worried about surviving the year, if it does get passed, ” Eveleth said. 
Nicole Teixeira, editor in chief of 
the Muir Quarterly , agreed.
“ As much as I would support get-
ting the Koala  off A.S. funding, to 
do it with this proposal comes at too great a cost, ” Teixeira said. “It’s going to limit [media organizations’] creativity, because they’re going to have someone to report back to, and it’s going to make it much harder for new organizations. ”
Gregorian expressed a similar con-
cern for startup media orgs on campus.
“It’s not going to hurt an estab-
lished newspaper like the Koala ,”  
Gregorian said. “We’ve just been here for too long for something like that to hurt us — but what it does hurt is new media, and that’s far worse than hurting the Koala , in my mind. ”
The A.S. Council will be holding 
an open forum Tuesday to discuss the guidelines and receive feedback from the community before being voted upon at Wednesday’s meeting. 
Kenworthy said he feels the legis-
lation could use some more thought.
“I think that we haven’t done 
enough to consult media orgs. We haven’t done enough to consult with departments — make sure everyone’s alright with it, and most of all, make sure they understand what the pro-cess is going to look like, ” Kenworthy said. “I mean, we’re having a forum the day before we’re actually passing it to see what they think of it. I just don’t think that, in hindsight, we handled the situation very well. ”

700BILLION IN STATE 
UNDING FOR 2009-10WAIT BY 
NUMBERS
STUDENTS WAITLISTED 
AT UCI LAST YEAROVERENROLLED STUDENTS IN THE UC SYSTEMOPINION MONDAY , JANUARY 25, 2010  THE UCSD GUARDIAN 7 
on our hands — especially while the 
university tries to cram 15,000 more students into lecture halls than it can adequately support with plummeting state funds.
The regents figure that a waitlist 
of roughly 1,000 students across the entire UC system will allow cam-puses the flexibility of staying within enrollment targets while still uphold-ing their famous top-students admis-sion guarantee.
Last year during application sea-
son, the UC system reduced enroll-ment by 2,300 students — admitting about 74,000 students, 34,000 of whom enrolled, over 2,000 stu-dents fewer than in 2008. Before the 2006 economic crash, the UC system was able to accommodate any miscalculations; however, cut after cut to the budget has left the university with little room for error.
Under the new waitlist 
system, however, the UC admis-sions departments can wait until the university’s 2010-11 budget becomes more clear this spring,  and enroll 
waitlist
ees based on how much 
money the state hands over.
It’s a practical move. Private col-
leges such as Princeton University and Boston College are making their waitlists longer to cushion unpre-dictable acceptance rates. In today’s economic environment, more and more students are turning away from private schools and toward public universities. Waitlists will allow each UC branch to maximize the admis-sion of students who actually want to attend that campus, while avoiding risky spikes in overenrollment.
And the news could be worse 
for applicants. Last week, the UC Office of the President announced  that the UC system was planning to cu t enr
ollment by an additional 
2,300 students for the 2010-11 aca-demic year. But they partially took back the evil last week, announcing that the university isn’t planning to cut enrollment quite so drastically — instead opening up the waitlist option. 
There are, of course, some draw-
backs to the waitlist. One campus might miss out on a $150 Statement of Intent to Register deposit fee if a student decides to hold out for a campus where he’s waitlisted. Then 
there’s the mental well-being of high-school seniors to consider. Students holding out to hear from a particular UC campus may hold off on community-college enrollment, only to be dealt a second disappoint-ing letter from their university of choice. Then, considering the 
intense cuts to state and community colleges, their plan B school might not have room for them either. 
Not knowing whether one is 
accepted or rejected can also make the financial planning essential to a college career even more excru-ciating. The regents have yet to figure out how students admitted from waitlists will receive finan-cial aid; and if the university plans to model its system after schools like Occidental College, students accepted from the waitlist would not receive financial aid. As the UC budget is gouged deeper and deeper, by the time waitlisted students are accepted, the aid well will likely have dried up. Cutting financial aid for waitlisted students could endanger the heavily touted Blue and Gold Plan, and have a devastating effect on those poorer families it currently protects.
In order to ensure equal financial 
aid for waitlisted students, campus aid offices will have to do a lot of research and pre-planning to cal-culate how many students will be taken off the waitlist, and therefore how many will need aid. Projections 
may seem simple enough, but recent years have seen some pain-fully off-point yield rates. In 2008, for instance, the university enrolled 1,800 more students than in 2007 — necessitating a drastic enrollment cut of 2,300 the following year.
The UC waitlist plan might put 
the system’s finances at an even greater disadvantage, but it’s worth the risk if the university can enroll as many students as possible. It’s the system’s mission to offer admission to all those who qualify, and in order to maintain its integrity during this recession, it might have to cut a few corners along the way. 
In the end, the waitlist idea 
might be canned altogether if Gov. Schwarzenegger’s proposed bud-get — which allots $53.4 million to the UC system — doesn’t pass. If we don’t receive at least that much money, those would-be 2,300 wait-listers will simply get the boot. Sad as that would be, the university’s No. 1 priority is not stuffing its lecture halls past maximum capacity. But granted we receive the better budget line, giving students a temporary “maybe” will provide the university’s shaky enrollment situation the leg-room it needs; and why deny a few hundred more students a raffle ticket to their dream school?

Michael & Richard Antonorsi
FOUNDERS, CHUAO CHOCOLATIERJ#:"-:44"#&3&;/",t4&/*0345"''83*5&3
UUnfortunately, there is no chocolate-making major at UCSD. That’s probably why 
Richard and Michael Antonorsi — two brothers who graduated from UCSD in the 
mid-1980s — settled on degrees in computer science and bioengineering, respec-tively.
However, once they left the La Jolla bubble, the duo resisted the corporate pull of 
their studies and left for their home country of Venezuela to pursue personal busi-ness ventures. One dot-com bust and a couple years of individual soul-searching later, the two reunited in Encinitas to found Chuao Chocolatier: a gourmet confec-tionary company with a knack for unpredictable flavor combos. 
At first, the siblings ran a modest candy boutique, testing out recipes and flavors 
to gauge their product’s popularity. Richard used the smarts he picked up in his dot-com days to manage the company’s business logistics, while Michael drew from his Parisian cooking education to come up with a couple eclectic concoctions.
Michael’s first successful flavor was Spicy Maya — a bow to an ancient Mayan 
hot-chocolate recipe that used pasilla chile and cayenne pepper. It opened the flood-gates to a slew of other odd combos: chocolate pods filled with passion fruit-infused caramel; bonbons flavored with goat cheese and fruity brandy; and the Firecracker — a salty dark-chocolate bar filled with pop rocks and chipotle.
“ All your senses are engaged, ” Michael said in an interview with This Week at 
$-"440' ‘84 & ‘85AAs if the buzz surrounding this season’s biggest 3-D block-
buster isn’t enough, UCSD students can add alma-mater pride to the list of reasons to watch “ Avatar. ” In the James Cameron feature film, UCSD alumnus and actor Dileep Rao — a 1995 Muir College graduate — plays the role of good scientist Dr. Max Patel, acting alongside Sigourney Weaver and Sam Worthington.
While at UCSD, Rao’s passion for acting led him to a 
class at the La Jolla Playhouse’s Summer Conservatory. Later, after graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in political sci-ence, he earned his Master of Fine Arts from the American Conservatory Theater. 
Since then, Rao has landed roles in both television and 
film, including the show “Brothers and Sisters” and “Drag Me to Hell” — a 2009 horror film in which he played a mysterious fortuneteller.
But after his rise to fame on the back of “ Avatar, ” Rao said 
he feels he’s truly made it. 
“My career is going very well, ” Rao said. “I live the life I 
dreamed — but scarcely hoped for — as young man in the dorms of Tioga and Tenaya. ”
Rao said UCSD was one of the most intellectually and 
diverse environments he has ever encountered.
“I met more inquisitive minds in my four years there than I 
have in most of the rest of my life, ” Rao said. “It’s the strangest hybrid of the finest scientists and mathematicians walking a grand campus with brilliant directors of theater, some great art and strong instruction in a vast range of departments. ”
He also credited professors in the theater department for 
teaching him a “standard of excellence” — something that has stayed with him throughout his professional career. 
Rao said he felt fortunate to work with Cameron — both 
for his legendary reputation and his visionary work.
With “ Avatar” behind him, Rao’s next movie will be in sci-fi 
thriller “Inception, ” due to be released in July 2010 alongside director Christopher Nolan and actor Leonardo DiCaprio.
“To be an artist and make my living from that effort is the 
most satisfying and humbling of journeys, ” Rao said. “My only advice is this: Pick what you love as soon as you know it, work harder than you can ever have and never, ever give up. ”Dileep Rao ACTOR, “AVATAR”  & “DRAG ME TO HELL ”J
Michel Kripalani VIDEO GAME DEVELOPER & MULTIMEDIA ENTREPRENEURJIIt’s no wonder video games still cap the top of your 
birthday wish list: The industry has gone from GoldenEye to Gears of War in two decades flat.
Just as video games began to make their way from TV 
sets to computer screens, Michel Kripalani was gearing up to graduate from UCSD with a Bachelor of Visual Arts. He was also finishing up a “life-changing” internship with a local design firm in Del Mar — one he said made his pas-
sion for digital media glaringly clear.
“By the time I graduated, I knew what I wanted to do 
professionally, ” Kripalani said. “I found myself at the cutting 
edge of a new industry. I loved the idea of mixing art and technology. ”
After college, Kripalani leapt straight into a startup com-
pany that set a swift pace for the young entrepreneur. After two years of designing interactive multimedia software, Kripalani switched things up and began to pour his talents into developing computer games. In 1991, when he was 
23, he started his second company, Presto Studios, with his 
roommate, hoping to develop the most advanced graphics a CD-ROM was capable of displaying. 
In the 11 years that Kripalani managed Presto, the 
team created photorealistic games such as the Journeyman Project series (a postapocalyptic, first-person adventure), Myst 3: Exile (a quest set in Tolkien dreamscapes) and Whacked! (in which goofy cartoons beat the crap out of each other with oversized staplers and grenades).
According to Kripalani, he was never afraid to take risks 
— an “entrepreneur at heart. ” When he was laid off last January by Autodesk — an international software/architec-tural design corporation — Kripalani was eager to surf the next wave of digital design. 
“The whole time I was at Autodesk I was planning my 
next big thing, ” Kripalani said. “When Apple shipped the first iPhone in June of 2007, I had to have one. When they made the [software development kit] available to developers and opened the App Store in June of 2008, the writing was on the wall. ”
That’s when Kripalani decided to embark on his lat-
est business endeavor: iPhone apps. In 2009, he formed Oceanhouse Media along with Presto Studios partner Greg Uhler and his wife Karen. The company that designs and publishes its own line of over 75 positive-spirited iPhone

IIn our current economic climate, 
the thought of making a career — and 
money — off something we love seems a mere classroom fantasy. But stories of serious daydreamers like 1978 Revelle College graduate Rusty Preisendorfer, founder and namesake of surf brand Rusty, still provide a scrap of hope.
Born and raised in San Diego, 
Preisendorfer started surfing in eighth grade, back when Black’s Beach — his favorite hometown break — was still an undiscovered gem.
In the fall of 1971, Preisendorfer 
entered his freshman year at UCSD, and immediately joined the surf team. That same year, he created his first board brand: Starlight Surfboards.
Preisendorfer took a break from aca-
demia in 1972 and spent the next three years surfing for Gordon and Smith, where he also worked behind the scenes constructing surfboards.  
Triumphant after his travels to some of the world’s most famous surf digs, Preisendorfer returned to UCSD in 1975 and chose a major in visual arts. He start-ed his second label — Music! Surfboards — the same year.
After graduating in 1978, Preisendorfer 
began shaping for Canyon Glassing. He spent the following seven years perfecting his technique and developing his reputa-tion as a top surfboard shaper.
Finally, in 1985, Rusty Surfboards was 
conceived.
The brand exploded, soon expanding 
to include skate, snow and wakeboarding gear and sell its merchandise throughout the Americas, Europe and Pacific Asia. In 2008, Preisendorfer was dubbed Surfing Magazine’s Shaper of the Y ear.
A San Diegan at heart, Preisendorfer 
still lives in La Jolla, an active fan and donor to Triton athletics, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the UCSD Moores Cancer Center’s annual Luau and Longboard Invitational. $-"440' ‘78

DDespite 
all the holier-than-thou atti-tudes on Y elp, ’86 Revelle alumni and plastic surgeon Dr. Tom Pousti has achieved the Holy Grail of consumer review site: a solid five-star rating.
Pousti isn’t 
only popular, 
he’s experienced too, with 12 years in private practice and over 10,000 surgeries—ranging from the usual tummy tucks and face lifts to the not-so-usual labial reductions, gyne-comastias and otoplasties (look ‘em up) — under his belt. Oh, and he’s expensive: A boob job will run you anywhere from $4,800 to $7,300 depending on what material you want floating around in your chest.
According to the doc, who grad-
uated with a degree in animal physi-ology, UCSD was his first choice, as was his profession. 
Pousti said he had always wanted 
to be a physician, but ultimately chose to specialize in plastic surgery because of the range of procedures he’ d have at his fingertips.
“The nice thing about plastic 
surgery is you get to do head to toe [work] — facial trauma, congenital trauma, burns, all kinds of recon-structive work, hand surgery, ” Pousti said. “There’s a lot of variety and I think variety is what makes it inter-esting. ”
With 15 years of postsecond-
ary education to his name (and diplomas from UCSD, UCI, and Harvard), Pousti’s spent more than half of his life in school.

buildings and benefits all over San Diego, closely linked to technology and high-class education. It’s no surprise that Gary Jacobs — UCSD alumnus and son of Irwin and Joan Jacobs, after whom UCSD’s engineer-ing school was named — has carried on the Jacob legacy in his own life’s work.
Founder and chair of High Tech High 
— a network of eight K-12 charter schools based in San Diego — 1979 graduate Gary Jacobs received his Bachelor of Arts in management science.
After graduation, Jacobs worked as a 
programmer and software engineer at his dad’s companies: Linkabit and Qualcomm. By the time he left behind the not-so-quaint family businesses in 2000, he had earned the title of senior education spe-cialist at Qualcomm and was striving to improve the math and science programs in local public schools. At the time, the busi-ness community was beginning to realize that traditional public high schools were not preparing students with the tools they needed to succeed in the 21st century.

To ground his vast collection 
of complimentary flavors, Michael 
always uses Venezuelan cacao seeds to make Chuao chocolate. In fact, the Antonorsi brothers’ family grew the plant themselves on a farm called Augustana in Rio Caribe back in the day. In honor of their roots, the broth-ers partnered with nonprofit organiza-tions to teach cacao-growing tech-niques in isolated areas of Venezuela.
On top of succeeding in their 
altruistic endeavors, the Antonorsi brothers collected about $2.5 million in sales in 2008, earning mention on several Food Network cooking shows and publications like Time and Newsweek. They’ve also partnered with a number of high-end cafes and grocery stores, including Whole Foods and Ralphs.
In another homage to their 
beginnings, the Antonorsi brothers’ chocolates are sold at Perks and the Sunshine Store. Y ou can also stop by the Chuao boutique in Westfield UTC to try a spicy Mayan hot choc-olate — if for no other reason than, as Michael put it, “chocolate makes you happy. ”simple program that reproduces the sound of Tibetan bowls every time you flick your finger across the screen.
According to Kripalani, his 
company hopes to produce up to 100 more apps this year, including a series of self-help programs based on the works of popular Hay House authors, and interactive eBooks based on Dr. Seuss classics. 
Kirpalani said he recommends getting as much work experience as possible in the college years.
 “Internships are absolutely fan-
tastic — they help to prepare you for the workforce, ” Kripalani said. “More importantly, they help you to determine if you truly are passion-ate about a particular field. So find an internship — jump in and get wet. And yes, Oceanhouse Media is always on the lookout for good interns. We’ve already hosted four students in the last year alone. ”when a colleague couldn’t make it. 
“I got hooked at that meeting, 
and the rest is history, ” he said.
Jacobs went on to found and 
chair High Tech High, which takes a revolutionary approach to educa-tion: All students participate in community service and intern-ships, with the aid of no textbooks nor traditional subject divisions; for instance, a single class consoli-dates art, biology and multimedia. Classes revolve around hands-on experiments — like, say, using DNA analysis to identify pieces of African bushmeat that are actu-ally endangered species, illegally poached.
It’s an unorthodox but success-
ful formula: Every one of High Tech High’s graduates has been admitted to college. 
On top of the countless hours he 
spends fostering High Tech High, Jacobs works in investments, owns minor-league baseball team Lake Elsinore Storm and stays involved in numerous philanthropic organi-zations in the San Diego area.
Gary and his wife Jerri-Anne 
even managed to one-up Mom and Pop Jacobs in 2006, when they donated $1 million to UCSD — the largest single gift ever made by an alumnus.
Despite his success, Jacobs said 
he still wishes he had established deeper connections with faculty and students at UCSD. 
“When one is out in the real 
world, it is extremely valuable to bounce ideas off of people you trust and have a shared experience with, ” Jacobs said. time you get to work, ” Pousti said. “But it’s definitely worth it. ”
And from his comments on what 
he misses most about our UCSD bubble, it’s clear that Pousti’s had to endure more than his fair share of sleepless nights and cram session to achieve his current success.
“I enjoyed [UCSD’s] libraries — 
lots of places to kind of sit down and study, ” Pousti said. “I was a pretty studious guy. I didn’t socialize as much as I would have liked to at that time. ”
His advice for would-be Nip/
Tuck-ers:
“Get a good start from the begin-
ning because it’s easier to keep a decent GPA than to try to make up ground. It’s easy to get distracted when you get into college — there’s lots of pretty girls and pretty boys and all kinds of distractions. Y ou gotta stay focused and keep your eyes on the prize. ”

SITESEEN
Pitched as “San Diego’s newest 18 and 21 hot 
spot, ” Satin Lounge revolves around the idea that 18-year-olds can enjoy a great clubbing 
experience without a drop of drink. And if elder folks don’t mind running into their baby cousin and her “Mean Girl” posse while drowning their collegiate sorrows, they might have a pretty good time, too. 
Probably due to its close proximity to San 
Diego State, Satin is a far cry from the glamor-ous nightclub it makes itself out to be. Patrons are required to make their way down a seedy, dimly lit alleyway to reach the entrance of the club, and — if they survive the trek — are then segregated by age into two separate lines. Those of age are welcomed in by a bright-orange wristband read-ing “OVER 21” in big black letters, while all eager under-agers are shepherded inside one door over, stumbling from pregame overcompensation.
The venue itself is a cross between a garage 
party and rundown strip club, complete with a disco ball and stripper pole in the middle of the dance floor. As for furnishings, red and white circus tent drapes fail miserably at disguising the lounge’s concrete walls, and the sound from scat-tered TV sets never seem to match up with the on-screen visuals.
Though Shirley-temple bars are plentiful in 
Satin Lounge, the only counter that serves alco-hol is caged by a chain-link fence. The ugly orange stripe, of course, is necessary to gain access 
to this player’s paradise. (Unsurprisingly, it seems a favorite hangout for older clubgoers of the male persuasion — perhaps having something to do with its perch over the wannabe strip-club area, 
conveniently swarming with young girls). The 
other drink stations cater to the underage crowd, where younger guys can practice their bar lean as they order a Red Bull or a root beer for the cutie in the corner.
Bottom line: Satin Lounge is the perfect desti-
nation to meet creepy older guys — and plenty of them. It’s also one of the only places you could get away with wearing sweatpants at a club (but don’t forget your Reeboks with the straps). Whatever the case, you’ll probably have a better time at the Taco Bell down the street.

STUDENT DISCOUNT!BYRON WASHOMUNCOMMON folk
BY KERRY FUGETT  s STAFF WRITER
The green movement at UCSD has gath-
ered substantial momentum over the last five years: Already, the university 
generates 80 percent of all the energy it consumes. Aside from having all the right scientific resources at our fingertips, a good amount of UCSD’s sustainability efforts can be credited to a dedicated few: students, fac-ulty and volunteers donating their personal time and prowess to make good on the cam-pus’ claim to be one of the greenest universi-ties in the nation.
For the last two years, solar-energy entre-
preneur Byron Washom has been doing just 
that: applying his vast knowledge of energy 
grids, renewable energy, recycling natural gas and creating zero waste to our current situation. 
“It’s like jumping on a train already run-
ning down the tracks, and it’s already headed where I wanted to go, ” Washom said. “I haven’t worked this hard in 20 years. I love it. ”
After two decades as president of 
Advanco Corp. — the self-founded environ-mental-technology consulting firm that set a world record in 1984 for converting 29.4 per-cent of solar energy to the grid — Washom said he is hoping he can preserve the campus spirit that attracted him to UCSD in the first place, when his son began attending the uni-versity. Washom soon came on as a volunteer for the school’s sustainability efforts. 
This past September, Washom became 
the campus’ first director of “strategic energy initiatives. ” The position was specially created for Washom to oversee the implementation of sustainable technology on campus, act as a consultant for green student organizations and oversee a new plan that’ll ensure UCSD meets its energy needs in the most envi-ronmentally safe and cost-effective manner possible. He has advised organizations like the World Bank, International Finance Corp., the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy on employing clean-energy technologies here and abroad.
According to Washom, green technology 
is rapidly gaining international attention, and — in the dour face of a stagnant economy — UCSD’s initiatives are pushing the envelope.
Not long after being hired, Washom 
spoke on behalf of the university when he voices his support for a proposal led by SDG&E (in conjunction with 28 other businesses and organizations including CleanTech San Diego and Qualcomm). The plan suggested creating a smart grid — a state-of-the-art electricity network con-necting consumers and suppliers in San Diego — and would produce up to 3,200 jobs in Southern California. The proposal was directed at the Obama administration, 
which set aside $4.5 billion for smart grids 
nationwide.
Just as Washom was entering his new 
position, the university was also installing one megawatt of photovoltaic solar panels atop the Gilman Parking Structure and initi-ating construction of a 2.4-megawatt fuel-cell system powered by Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Facility — which will replace carbon-based fuel with a methane-based alternative.
Washom said a substantial push for the 
university’s green ambitions has come from activists within the student body. And, as a host of energy initiatives pick up steam, he said students are becoming more and more involved with the innumerable projects and operations on campus.
But good intentions can’t go anywhere 
without the funds to back them. This past November, a huge chunk of funding was gifted Jacob’s School of Engineering students, who wrote a grant proposal that secured $154 million of federal funds for the develop-ment of clean, renewable energy. According to Washom, it comes down to momentum: Once you start getting grants, it’s a lot easier to get even more.  
“I defy anyone to show me another 
campus which has the same composition of support for sustainability as UC San Diego, ” Washom said. “To know us is to love us. ”

Christian Hatch sent in eight points.
No other Triton scored more 
than five points in the game. 
Despite jumping out to a 15-4 
lead — with Lawley and Acevedo connecting for three triples — the Tritons could not rein back the Lumberjacks after giving up the lead, and suffered a 60-74 defeat. 
UCSD returns home for four 
straight games over the next two weeks. The team will open the stretch against Cal Poly Pomona on Jan. 28 at 7:30 p.m., before 
welcoming Cal State San Bernardino into town on Jan. 31.

In the speediest event of the day, 
junior Jessica Ferguson won a close 50-yard freestyle heat with a time of 24.64 seconds. Once the men were up, senior Dan Perdew was the first to flip, and powered through the final sprint to win with a time of 21.14 seconds. Perdew’s next victory came in the 100-yard butterfly.
Junior Anju Shimura easily beat 
out the competition in both the 100-yard and 200-yard backstroke events, with times of 58.56 seconds and 2:06.42 minutes, respectively.To close the day, the women’s 
200-yard freestyle team — Shimura, Ferguson, sophomore Shea Kopp and freshman Amber Tan — won with a time of 1:37.73.
The men’s team —  Perdew, 
freshman Julius Espiritu, senior Todd Langland and sophomore Blake Langland — won the same event with a close time of 1:23.73.
“For [the seniors], it’s a much 
bigger emotional event, ” coach McGihon said. “But I know we’ll get to see them again. And many of them will be swimming at nationals — and it’s bigger to see them swim at conference than at a dual meet. ”
After earning a handful of 
automatic bids to the national championships this past weekend, the Tritons hope to add more at the 
dual meet at UC Davis next Saturday. The team will then travel to the Pacific Collegiate Swimming and Diving Conference Championships, taking place Feb. 10 to Feb. 13 in Long Beach.
Coach McGihon feels that the 
upcoming showdown will be a defining meet for the Tritons, as they will be facing off against their conference rivals for the last time before nationals.
“We just want to drive home that 
it’s the little details that make all the difference, ” McGihon said. “When you’re going after a championship performance, you can’t overlook the little things. ”

Seawolf Stephanie Barnes hit a

Ilg knocked down a three-pointer with 14:11 remaining, putting the Tritons up by 12; UCSD led by double digits for the remainder of the game. 
The Tritons limited Sonoma to 
only 21 second-half points and 28-per-cent shooting from the floor.
Our defense is what won the game 
for us, ” Hunter said. “We came out in the second half with a mission to get a defensive stop every play. We pres-sured the ball, rebounded and tried to get a steal or stop on every possession. ” 
The win put the Tritons at 15-1

Sonoma was led by senior guard

SWIMMING & DIVING —  
UCSD honored its 10 graduating 
members with a victory sendoff against Cal Baptist University at Canyonview Pool on Jan. 23. 
The Tritons maintained their 
focus despite the emotional nature of the home finale. The men’s team emerged victorious over the Lancers 173-127, while the women won 15 of 16 events to take a 231-
66 victory in the team’s penultimate 
matchup of the season.
“It feels really good, ” head 
coach Scott McGihon said. “On the women’s side, we had some really good performances — and it was really good to get in today, especially since we only have one more meet before conference champions. As far as the men, it’s 
the first time we’ve ever beaten Cal 
Baptist, and we had tremendous performances from [them] too. ”
The men’s and women’s 200-
yard medley teams came off the blocks with two quick victories, setting the tempo for the Tritons. “They’re in our conference, ” 
coach McGihon said. “So we see them at conference championships. We’ve beaten them there, just never in a dual meet. It just shows the great depth we have on the team. ”
Freshman Beth Dong followed 
the early victories by capturing first place in the 1000-yard freestyle with a time of 10:29.06 — 14 seconds ahead of the next closest competitor. Dong went on 
to win the 500-yard freestyle with 
a decisive time of 5:08.34.
Senior Jereme Barnett-Woods 
won the 1,000-yard freestyle by 11 seconds, posting a 9:48.23 time. He later returned to the pool to notch a victory in the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 4:42.66.
The Tritons swept the entire 
podium in the men’s and women’s 
100-yard breaststroke. Senior Juan 
Pablo Carrillo touched in first with a time of

of his closest teammate.

MEN’S BASKETBALL —  Coming off a 
double-overtime thriller at home against San Francisco State on Jan. 16, the UCSD men’s basketball team sought to carry its momentum against Humboldt State and Sonoma State on Jan. 21 and Jan. 23, but was ultimately swept away by both teams.
The Tritons lost 66-78 to Sonoma 
State at Sea Wolf Gymnasium  on Jan. 
23, and fell 60-74 to Humboldt State at 
Lumberjack Gym on Jan. 21. The two losses put the Tritons at 4-10 overall and 3-8 in California Collegiate Athletic Association play.
Senior guard Jordan Lawley put on 
a stellar performance Saturday, scoring 28 points, five boards and 
three assists. Lawley went nine -of-19 from 
the field, scoring 18 of his 28 points in the first half alone.
Senior guard Tyler 
Acevedo sent in eight  
points of his own, and freshman forward  
Justin Brue had a solid game off the bench, racking up seven points and six rebounds in just 16 minutes of play. 
The Tritons shot at 
43 percent overall. 
The Seawolves led 
by as many as nine points in the first half, but UCSD battled back to make it a tight game. The match saw 11 total ties and eight lead changes.
After Brue grabbed 
the lead 56-55 on a jump shot, Sonoma regained control with a three-pointer  
and pair of free throws. UCSD never came within seven points for the rest of the game, and eight Sonoma  free throws 
in the final minute put the nail in the coffin for the Tritons. 
“For both games, we came out 
really str o
ng and competed with an 
early lead, ” sophomore guard Jay Wey said. “But as the game progressed, our intensity trailed off and we ended up coming up short. Both games had too many turnovers, and we had trouble rebounding defensively when it mattered. We are a young team that is getting better though, and I’m expecting good things [for] these upcoming games leading up to the Spirit Night game. ”
On Thursday, the Lumberjacks scored 
24 points o f
f of 18 Triton turnovers. 
Humboldt  also took a 26-8 advantage on 
bench scoring.
UCSD shot at 50 percent while 
Humboldt shot at 48 percent; however, the opponents were plus-nine at the 
charity line. 
Lawley, the conference’s leading 
scorer, did all he could for UCSD, scoring 30 points after matching a career-high 31 against San Francisco State. However, Lawley needed more help from the 
supporting cast, who combined for just 
30 points  behind him. Acevedo was 
three-of-nine from the field for nine UCSD SUFFERS 
BACK-TO-BACK ROAD LOSSESIN CONFERENCE
WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — The UCSD 
women suffered their first loss of the season on Jan. 21, falling 84-80 to Humboldt State. However, the Tritons bounced back well from the loss, pulling away in the second half of Saturday night’s game to defeat Sonoma State 68-52. 
On Thursday, Humboldt powered past the 
Tritons, riding on outstanding performances from center Brittney Taylor and guard Andrea Bobic, who together scored 53 of the Lumber-jacks’ total 80 points. Taylor had a game-high 28 points and 10 rebounds, and Bobic added 25 points on nine-of-15 shooting — including seven-of-13 from beyond the arc. 
The Tritons took a 37-35 lead into halftime, 
but the Lumberjacks caught fire from field in the second half, converting over 50 percent of their shots. Though the team trailed by as many as nine points in the second half, a basket by sophomore guard Chelsea Carlisle tied the game with 3:09 remaining. Humboldt respond-ed with a 6-0 run over the next two minutes to seal its victory. 
California Collegiate Athletics Association 
leading scorer Carlisle weighted the Triton score with 22 points, while senior guard An-nette Ilg scored 19 points and junior forward Tiffany Hunter added 14 points and three steals.
The final score was the second highest point 
total in any game so far this season, and it was in those last moments — when the game turned into a shootout — that the Tritons could not keep up with the Lumberjacks. 
“We have worked so hard to maintain a per-
fect record, and to have it thrown away from one bad game made us all really upset, ” said Hunter. “It showed us that when we don’t play our defensive game, then we aren’t as good. ”
The Tritons’ first loss of the season put 
them at 14-1 overall and 9-1 in conference play. Humboldt moved to 11-4 overall and 9-2 in the CCAA.
The Tritons bounced back in a big way 
against Sonoma State on Saturday, winning the game by a landslide after outscoring the Seawolves 34-21 in the second half. Sonoma scored the opening bucket, but senior forward Erin Noonan quickly responded with one of her own, and the Tritons never looked back.
The team was led once again by Carlisle, 
who totaled 21 points on six-for-nine shoot-ing. Noonan and junior forward Tiffany Hunter each added 10 points for UCSD, while Ilg con-tributed nine points and a game-high eight re-bounds. 
UCSD led by as many as 12 points in the first 
half, but a Sonoma rally in the final two minutes
