A.S. Council’s proposed transportation fee ref -
erendum, which would add a $52 quarterly 
student fee to cover transportation services 
will finally be voted on by students Week 8 of Winter 
Quarter 2014.
The text of the referendum will be sent to students 
Week 4 of winter quarter and will be sent again no 
later than two weeks prior to the election dates. The 
referendum specifies that 71 percent of the fee will be 
allocated to Transportation Services and a Student 
Transportation Advisory Committee for improve -ments in mass transit and alternative transportation, 
while the other 29 percent will go to financial aid, as 
mandated by a statewide return-to-aid policy.
“We’ll be leading a big education campaign this 
quarter to make sure folks understand this isn’t 
an out-of-the-blue referendum charging students 
money, ” A.S. President Andy Buselt said. “ As long as 
we’re doing our education campaign and students are

Latest Poll: Faulconer Up 
on Alvarez by One PointCarol Padden Named 
New Vice Chancellor EDI  
The election to elect a new mayor will be held Feb. 11.
UCSD professor of communi -
cation Carol Padden was named 
Interim Vice Chancellor for Equity, 
Diversity and Inclusion on Jan. 6, 
following the departure of previous 
VC-EDI Linda S. Greene on Dec. 31.
Greene’s departure was 
announced on Dec. 6, returning 
to her position as Evjue-Bascom 
Professor of Law at University of 
Wisconsin-Madison after acting as 
UCSD’s first ever VC-EDI for nearly 
one year.
Administrators in the Office of 
the Chancellor and Office of the 
Executive Vice Chancellor for 
Academic Affairs appointed Padden 
in hopes of continuing Greene’s work to apply strategic campuswide 
plans for faculty equity and diversity.
“I’m looking forward to con -
tinuing the work that Linda Greene 
began, ” Padden said. “With the assis -
tance of the excellent staff in the 
VC-EDI office, we will continue to 
play a role in UC San Diego’s efforts 
to be an engine of opportunity for 
our community. ”
Padden will also work alongside 
Student Affairs to promote diversity 
awareness and will work to convert 
the Raza Resource Centro student 
center — involved in supporting 
and providing resources for UCSD’s 
Chicano and Latino population — 
into a Campus Community Center.MN%%B"P#I#%%-""I#P#-!#- %%

A recent 10News/UT-San Diego 
poll shows that Kevin Faulconer and 
David Alvarez are neck and neck, with 
Faulconer possessing 47 percent of the 
vote and Alvarez taking 46 percent. 
With less than five weeks before the 
runoff election on Feb. 11, the two 
candidates are busy earning money 
and gaining supporters for their cam -
paigns.
UCSD political scientist Steven 
Erie told UT-San Diego that the close 
race between the two candidates led 
them to agree on having six debates.
“Y ou’ve got two city councilmen 
who each represent a portion of town 
competing citywide in a low-turnout election, and this is a great way to 
introduce themselves to the gazillions 
of voters who didn’t come out Nov. 
19, ” Erie said.
The runoff election was sched -
uled as a result of the special election 
that took place on November 2013 to 
replace disgraced mayor Bob Filner. 
Faulconer led with 43.6 percent, fol -
lowed by Alvarez with 25.6 percent 
of the votes. UCSD political science 
professor of practice Nathan Fletcher 
came in third with 24.3 percent of 
supporters while former San Diego 
city attorney Michael Aguirre placed 
fourth, with 4.44 percent.

U.S. universities in federal research 
and development expenditures for 
the 2012 fiscal year according to the 
National Science Foundation, spend -
ing a grand total of $1.074 billion on 
related expenses. 
According to Vice Chancellor for 
Research Sandra A. Brown, UCSD 
has ranked in the top 10 U.S. univer -
sities in such expenditures for over a 
decade, as recorded by the National 
Science Foundation. The fiscal 2012 
data show a 6.4 percent increase in 
spending in fiscal 2011.
“UC San Diego is also among 
the national leaders in the life sci -ences, which account for more than 
half of all R&D at universities and 
colleges, ” Brown said in the UCSD 
News Center press release.
UCSD spent more than UC San 
Francisco and UCLA in the survey, 
which ranked in sixth and eighth 
place, respectively.
According to Lynn Reaser, an 
economist at Point Loma Nazarene 
University, while UCSD’s success in 
attracting federal funds serves as an 
asset to the San Diego community, it 
can also pose some difficulties. 
“The reliance of UCSD and our 
region on research dollars also points 
to vulnerabilities, ” Reaser said to the 
U-T San Diego on Aug. 18, 2013. 
“Most of the funding comes from 
government agencies, which could be affected by budget spending caps 
over the next decade. While seques -
tration still left a significant total of 
research funding this year, the total 
was down from the 2012 level. More 
reductions could well lie ahead. ”
According to NSF statistics, 
total higher education federal R&D 
expenditures increased by 5 percent 
each year from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 
2011. The decline in expenditures 
from fiscal  2011 to fiscal 2012 repre -
sents the first period of decline since 
fiscal 1974.
Life sciences expenditures 
decreased from $37.3 billion in fiscal 
2011 to $37.2 billion in fiscal 2012. 
The physical sciences, including 
chemistry and physics, experienced 
a 1.3-percent decrease from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 as well.
According to the U-T San Diego, 
UCSD officials said funding might 
have reached $1 billion if federal 
agencies had not reduced the num -
ber and size of grants. 
Brown said that the university 
has taken active steps against this.
“We have compensated for a por -
tion of this reduction by writing 
more grants, ” Brown told the U-T 
San Diego. “Our faculty members 
are working harder and seeking and 
obtaining more funding from non -
federal sources so that the net reduc -
tions are much smaller than at other 
universities. ”L THE UCSD GUARDIAN | THURSDAY , JANUARY 9, 2014 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  532?

student voice will be heard. ”
Two independent surveys of 
graduate students, conducted by the 
Graduate Student Association, indi -
cated graduate student support for a 
transportation fee, leading the GSA 
to endorse the referendum on Dec. 2. 
“We want students to make an 
educated and informed decision while 
voting, ” GSA President Rahul Kapadia 
said. “ Also, putting a referendum on 
a student ballot is a major task, and 
we need to get it right the first time, 
rather than have it fail or not support 
the services students need. ”
In order to ensure that the funds are directed in students’ interest, the 
Student Transportation Advisory 
Committee solely will be allotted 
$2.22 per student per quarter. This 
will amount to almost $200,000 a year 
for special projects such as bike-shar -
ing programs, carpool and parking 
solutions. Transportation Services will 
receive $34.70 per student per quarter. 
The amount of revenue generated 
by the referendum will be enough to 
fill the $3 million deficit, continue 
funding the current transportation 
programs and expand student access 
to transportation. The intention is to 
give students universal access to all 
San Diego transit, including buses 
and light rail. According to Executive 
Director of ASUCSD Moves Kyle Heiskala, this will expand students’ 
options for off-campus living.
“My general feeling is that this is an 
opportunity to solve the problems and 
if students aren’t able to find a solution 
this year we’ve gone past the point of 
maintaining services, ” Heiskala said. 
“Students will have to pay out-of-pock -
et for bus service, and I would see it as 
a clear point of decline for mass transit 
for the UCSD community. ”
If passed, the fee will go into effect 
Fall 2014. In order to pass, the major -
ity of voters must support the fee 
referendum and 20 percent of eligible 
voters must cast a vote./uni25B6 REFERENDUM,  from page 1

votes from the November 2013 special 
election.
Although he will not be teaching 
winter quarter, Fletcher will return to 
teaching political science at UCSD for 
the spring quarter after announcing his 
retirement from public life.
Republican candidate Faulconer 
and Democratic candidate Alvarez 
kicked off their campaigns recently on Jan. 4 with the hopes of winning more 
votes, specifically Fletcher’s supporters 
in the previous election. Faulconer’s 
campaign has raised around $430,000

Alvarez’s campaign raised around

War on $2.24 UCSA Fee
We’re only a few days into win -
ter quarter, and the harshest reality 
of being back at school is already 
upon me: council’s squabbling, 
inevitable indecisiveness and a 
gratifyingly short meeting.
Last night’s meeting began with 
an introduction to new IFC repre -
sentative Dalton DeFendis and new 
Panhellenic 
Representative 
Sydney. I felt 
bad about miss -
ing Sydney’s 
last name until 
roll call, when council made it clear 
it was in the same boat as I and 
addressed the newcomers by first 
name only. DeFendis got his inaugu -
ral A.S. Council awkward moment 
over with right away when his unsi -
lenced phone gave everyone a taste 
of the Y ouTube video he was watch -
ing mid-meeting.
The first mildly amusing objec -
tion of the night came over a “con -
troversial” single-cent allocation 
to KSDT radio. This, however, was 
passed quickly, and the radio station 
will receive its allotted 66 cents in 
funding per student each quarter.
The awaited contention of 
the night came when discussing 
yearly dues to the UC Student 
Association. According to VP 
External Affairs Vanessa Garcia, 
UCSD originally passed a referen -
dum agreeing to pay the $1-per-
student per-year minimum for 
membership to UCSA. 
However, the UCSA fee mini -
mum was later adjusted to $1.30 
per student, lower than past years, 
when UCSD paid $2.24 per stu -
dent. For the upcoming year, UCSD 
chose to pay the minimum of $1.30. 
UCSA, which expected UCSD to 
pay the additional $20,000 it paid in previous years with the higher 
per-student fee, was forced to use 
reserve funds to make up for the 
shortfall. Now, UCSA is pressur -
ing UCSD to disburse the higher 
amount it paid previously.
Social Sciences Senator Colin 
King eloquently made the personal 
attack of the evening to Garcia. “I 
know you men -
tioned you’re in a 
difficult position, 
but I think it’s 
important when 
you go into those 
meeting that you maintain the 
interest of the UCSD student body, ” 
King said. “because they’re the ones 
that got you into those meetings. ”
AVP Student Advocacy Alex 
Noronha suggested that UCSA 
increase the minimum fee require -
ment to $1.35 for all UC campuses, so 
that “all campuses shoulder the bur -
den, rather than just UCSD. ”
“The students voted on $1 per stu -
dent per year, and it’s already bumped 
up to $1.30, ” King said. “I think they 
should expect $1 and count anything 
above that as a blessing. ”
Garcia then made a logical sug -
gestion in response to the debate over 
what was deemed an unfair request 
by UCSA.
“If you all disagree with this, then 
fail it, ” Garcia said. “If you don’t want 
this, then don’t vote yes on it, and I’ll 
bring it back to UCSA. ” 
Alas, after an hour of sitting on the 
edge of my seat, wondering whether 
I would end up paying an additional, 
hard-earned 94 cents to UCSA, the 
decision was tabled to next week.
Less than two hours after enter -
ing the Forum, I got to leave, 
counting my own blessings. Props 
to council for efficiency, and wel -
come back from break!

* THE UCSD GUARDIAN | T HURSDAY , JANUARY 9, 2014 | WWW. UCSDGUARDIAN .ORG 
What We’re Wishing For in 
Last year, Chancellor Pradeep Khosla created town hall forums 
to ask what students would like to see change at UCSD.  /T_his 
inspired the Guardian’ s Editorial Board to compile a list of 
things that we wanted in 2013. We decided to do it again.
Better administration for the Che Cafe.
When the University Centers Advisory Board announced last quarter 
that the Che Cafe had failed to maintain its nonprofit status and faced 
imminent closure, one of UCSD’s oldest and coolest concert venues was 
threatened with a shutdown. This year, we wish for the Che to find better 
administration so UCAB isn’t forced to stop the music.A long-term solution for the trans -
portation crisis.
We’re crossing our fingers for a 2014 that 
doesn’t force us to get a new bus sticker 
every month. Rather than dragging out the 
funding problem indefinitely, A.S. Council 
and UCSD Transportation Services need 
to collaborate on a long-term solution 
that doesn’t include sudden drastic cuts 
or require students to spend exorbitant 
amounts just to get to campus.
Fewer slate-versus-slate catfights on A.S. Council.
Every year, it seems that A.S. Council slates use petty grievances to drag 
pre-election mudslinging further and further into their terms in office. 
This year, we wish for the incoming council not to dwell on old slate alli -
ances and to use its 30 weeks in office to get to the agenda items that 
truly affect students — the transportation crisis and the Student Health 
Insurance Plan debt — /uni00A0right away.Alumni donations towards actual student issues and needs.
While UCSD graduates love to donate sculptures for our fields and houses for 
the tops of our buildings, we hope our growing pool of alumni donors could 
help us financially with our more-pressing academic issues. Giving to non-art 
areas of the university, like fixing up lecture halls or expanding Price Center 
hours and services benefits students far more than the “giraffe catchers. ”
The bike paths we were promised. 
Every time a cyclist barrels down Library 
Walk, weaving in between (or into) stu -
dents traveling on foot, we wonder what 
ever happened to A.S. President Andy 
Buselt’s campaign promise to bring bike 
paths to campus. It’s still not clear what 
progress has been made behind the scenes, 
but work should start soon so our campus 
pedestrians and cyclists can travel safely.More campus security, and better campus lighting.
Last quarter we had a stabbing near Center Hall during finals week that might 
have been preventable. UCSD is huge, hilly and full of eucalyptus trees that 
make it difficult to monitor every area on campus, but installing more lighting 
in dark areas and hiring more on-patrol UCPD officers can help prevent future 
incidents.
A faculty that doesn’t run away.
Faculty retention continues to be one of the biggest “needs improvement” 
areas of UCSD’s administration. Another bunch of higher-ups departed 
in 2013, including the first-ever Vice Chancellor of Equity, Diversity and 
Inclusion Linda Greene, whose departure was announced after only 11 
months on campus. We hope the administration can better incentivize 
faculty members and administrators to stay in 2014 and prevent further 
turnover and instability.Clear communication between stu -
dents and the Sun God Task Force.
Abolishing Sun God guest tickets shocked 
and angered a lot of people, but the dam -
age has been done. In the next few months, 
we hope the newly created Task Force can 
increase its transparency and get students 
on board with its changes. The last thing 
we want to see is UCSD’s treasured day of 
debauchery going down the toilet. Students, 
too, can help keep Sun God around by 
making better choices and learning how to 
handle their liquor.Support for students affected by the 
UC-wide smoking ban.
Tobacco use and sale are now prohibited 
on all 10 University of California campuses, 
though resources for addicts and regular 
smokers are limited at best. UC Irvine has 
announced it will permit e-cigarette usage, 
and we think that trend should expand to 
the other UC campuses to help smokers 
transition while complying with the rule. 
Campuses should also do more to help stu -
dents quit and be lenient with fines in the 
early months of the ban.
Someone to save our SHIP .
After a third-party management firm under-
budgeted the cost of the UC-wide Student 
Health Insurance Plan, it was left $49 million 
in debt — UCSD alone owes over $13 mil -
lion — with seemingly no one but students 
to pay it back. In 2014, we don’t want to pay 
out of our own pockets for the administra -
tion’s costly mistakes, and we hope that cuts 
to our coverage are minimal or nonexistent.
More readership and reader 
feedback for the Guardian.
We at the Guardian have gone through a 
massive website redesign and have spent a 
tremendous amount of time improving our 
content, and we only plan to keep moving 
forward. We care about our readers and 
want to liberate the student voice, cheer -
ful or scathing as it may be. We always 
encourage you to write us a letter to the 
editor and put your opinion out there.Some hope (and better food) for 
Revelle students.
Although campus dining is generally less 
than stellar, Revelle residents this year really 
got drew the shortest straw. Plaza Cafe never 
something to write home about, but the 
dreadful food truck and its ridiculous buf -
falo chicken rice bowls sent students fleeing 
to an already-packed Pines. We hope that 
the forthcoming, renovated “64 Degrees” 
will be worth the wait.A balanced California budget with more funding for the UC system.
After California Gov. Jerry Brown’s proposed state budget leaked online 
Wednesday night, it seems there will be a hefty difference in funding to the UC 
system from what the UC Board of Regents expected in its own budget. We can 
only ask that the state legislature keeps us in mind when it approves the budget 
later this year and increases funding to the UC system, preventing future cuts 
and tuition hikes.Better snack shacks on campus.
What is D’Lush, and why is it coming to 
Price Center? With the exception of vague 
(and blurry) memories of seeing the com -
pany’s “lounge” at the Sun God Festival, 
no one knows what D’Lush is, and no one 
seems to care. The introduction of Starbucks 
will inevitably outshine the self-described 
“deluxe beverage joint.” We should be worry -
ing about more pressing culinary concerns, 
such as the fact that there’s no word on get -
ting rid of the ever-failing Bombay Coast.ILLUSTRATI ON BY ELYSE YANG /GUARDIAN

Dear Editor,
/uni00A0The U.S., the richest country in the world, 
doesn’t have the money to provide health 
care and security for its citizens, even though 
virtually every other developed country 
does. /uni00A0Republicans continue to call for social 
cuts that aid the poor of our country while 
Democrats seem hogtied. So why can’t we 
equal other countries in providing for our 
citizens? Is it because we spend half of our fed -

the military budget [about] 30 percent, and it

And look what our military has

With the greatest military on Earth, we can’t

responsible approach, helping rather than 
harming others, both here and abroad.

Dear Editor,
In 2008, China sentenced three Tibetans 
up to 13 years jail time.  Then-House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi urged then-President George 
Bush not to attend the opening ceremonies of 
the Summer Olympics in Beijing. A concur -
ring resolution passed by a vote of 413 to 1. 
Dianne Feinstein introduced a similar resolu -
tion in the Senate. /uni00A0 
“For some members of the U.S. Congress 
to set aside the Olympic spirit and the prin -
ciple that sports should not be politicized, 
and even to openly encourage interfer -
ence with and harm to the San Francisco 
torch relay, completely lacks basic morals 
and conscience, ” a statement posted on the 
Chinese Foreign Ministry’s website claimed. 
Meanwhile, the president and first lady 
watched from the bleachers as Michael Phelps 
swam to Olympics glory. 
UC President Janet Napolitano said she will lead the U.S. delegation at an opening 
ceremony of the Winter Games in Sochi. 
Napolitano also said on “Meet the Press” 
last Sunday that she would rule out offering 
clemency to Edward Snowden, who fled to 
Hong Kong after he began leaking documents 
to media outlets last summer. Snowden now 
lives in Russia but has asked several countries 
publicly for asylum.
“The Lives of Others” (“Das Leben 
der Anderen”) is a 2006 film by F. H. 
Donnersmarck about the monitoring of the 
people of East Berlin by agents of the Stasi. 
This important film won the 2006 Best 
Foreign Academy Award. 
In 1984, officer Wiesler is assigned to 
spy on playwright Dreyman. Wiesler and his 
team bug the apartment, set up surveillance 
equipment in an attic and begin reporting 
Dreyman’s activities. At Dreyman’s birthday 
party, his friend Albert Jerska (a blacklisted 
theatrical director) gives him sheet music for 
“Sonate vom Guten Menschen“ (“Sonata For a 
Good Man”). 
In November 1989, Wiesler is steaming 
open letters in a windowless office when 
a co-worker tells him about the fall of the 
Berlin Wall; realizing what this means, they 
both silently get up and walk out. Wiesler 
passes a bookstore window display promot -
ing Dreyman’s new novel, “Sonate vom Guten 
Menschen. ” He goes inside, opens a copy of 
the book and discovers it is dedicated “To 
HGW XX/7, with gratitude. ” Wiesler buys the 
book; when the sales clerk asks if he wants it 
gift-wrapped, he responds, “No, it’s for me. ”

I’m only about seven years late 
to the party, but I finally joined 
the digital age by ditching my 
beat-up “dumbphone” in favor of 
an iPhone 5C. 
For those of you who can afford 
the extra monthly data expenses 
but are still stubbornly clinging 
onto your sliders, clamshells or — 
God forbid — PalmPilots, let this 
serve as the umpteenth reminder 
that it’s about sweet time that you 
make the smart -
phone conversion.
These tech -
nological Swiss 
army knives have 
not only become 
a necessary convenience but have 
also become a ubiquitous part of 
our culture, most particularly with 
the up-and-coming generation of 
young adults. 
The 2013 Pew Research Center 
survey on smartphone ownership 
noted that smartphone adoption 
appears to be universal among 
those between the ages of 18 and 
29, even permeating 77 percent 
of those in this age category 
with annual income levels below 
$30,000.
With usage this widespread, not 
owning one may project a nega -
tive image of you to the outside 
world. In the workplace, it can be 
regarded as a faux pas to be seen 
with outdated technology by your 
superiors, especially if you are new 
or are trying to climb the corpo -
rate ladder. 
When a friend of mine started 
out at a big financial firm, he was 
taken aback when he noticed that 
all of his bosses and coworkers were 
wielding shiny, up-to-date gadgets 
while he was still using the formerly 
trendy Motorola Razr. Embarrassed, he would always step outside to 
make calls and would text with his 
phone shielded under his desk. Just 
as not having a Facebook may cause 
hiring managers to deem job can -
didates as peculiar, the absence of 
a modern mobile may prompt your 
office to label you as technologi -
cally backward.
There are also unfortunate con -
sequences for dumbphone adher -
ents in the social sector. Men may 
find that they can 
initially catch the 
attention of women 
at bars or social 
events, only to 
have them zip away 
the second a flip phone is whipped 
out. A March 2013 study from 
the mobile video company Vuclip 
found that 61 percent of men claim 
that their phone is the first charac -
teristic people notice about them — 
surpassing watches, shoes and cars. 
The men in the study believed that 
others equated having old technol -
ogy with being poor, cheap or pos -
sessing bad taste.
With my brick of a phone finally 
put to rest, gone are the days of 
hiding my phone from the tech-
savvy sixth-graders I tutor. Gone 
also are the days of being excluded 
from the “stack your phones on 
the table during dinner” game, 
because when I would place my 
ancient Pantech on top of the pile 
of Samsung Galaxies, HTCs and 
iPhones, my friends would chuckle 
and assure me that I could keep 
mine because I “wouldn’t be using 
it, anyway. ” 
If you are still one of the strag -
glers out there with a dumbphone, 
consider prioritizing the switch. In 
the eyes of today’s society, you are 
practically Amish.2007 Called, And It

BY DEVON MUNOS
Outer-space thriller “Gravity” is aptly named for both the challenges the characters face and 
the monumental emotional voyage the audience experiences. Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) 
and seasoned astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) fight the physical difficulty of escaping 
disaster and the psychological turmoil suffered in the process. The cinematography features long, 
sweeping shots that make the film feel real. Viewers are left gripping their armrests in fear as they 
watch the main characters struggle to survive in space.
“MODERN VAMPIRES OF THE CITY”
— VAMPIRE WEEKEND
BY KYLE SOMERS
The true genius behind “Modern Vampires of the City” is that Vampire 
Weekend created a lineup of some of the warmest, brightest, most enjoyable 
tracks of the year while flawlessly working in a dark and intelligent message 
about human impermanence. At once evoking thoughts of youthful adven -
tures and the beckoning finger of death, Vampire Weekend has clearly lost 
any capacity to give a fuck about an Oxford comma.SAVING MR. BANKS
BY ALLIE KIEKHOFER
“Saving Mr. Banks,” Disney’s newest classic, reflects on the making of another Disney clas -
sic, Oscar-winning 1964 hit “Mary Poppins. ” To turn her stories into a film, Walt Disney (Tom 
Hanks) must work with high-strung Pamela Travers (Emma Thompson), author of the semi-
autobiographical “Mary Poppins” books. “Saving Mr. Banks” shows the grating moviemaking 
process, as Travers fights nearly every creative liberty that Disney takes. Ultimately, “Banks” 
proves that, with a hit like “Mary Poppins, ” Disney’s efforts are worth the work.
“RANDOM ACCESS MEMORIES”
— DAFT PUNK
BY KYLE SOMERS
“Random Access Memories” is a vivid walking tour of Daft Punk’s universe 
of icy, synth-powered techno and vibrant dance club anthems. The music ranges 
from the dramatic musical theater-esque lines of “Touch, ” to the rocketship 
takeoff in “Contact, ” to the sex-addicted disco beats of “Get Lucky. ” Despite its 
eclecticism, the album as a whole is a cohesive, focused vision that gives listeners 
no choice but to let their hair down and lose themselves to dance.BLUE JASMINE
BY ETHAN FUKUTO
“Blue Jasmine” is a superb but downcast character piece of an unstable woman in emo -
tional and financial disarray. Featuring a career-best performance by Cate Blanchett, the 
film is supported by an impressive cast and an intriguing screenplay by Woody Allen that 
follows the fictitious, riches-to-rags socialite Jasmine as she attempts rebuild her life in San 
Francisco. There are laughs to be had, but the film’s greatness comes from the complex, shat -
tered Jasmine navigating a post-recession America.
THE WOLF OF WALL STREET
BY EMILY BENDER
In collaboration, Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio can do no wrong. Working 
together for the fifth time, the film recounts the real-life story of convicted stock-market 
manipulator Jordan Belfort. Set in the late ’80s, the film is a Wall Street roller coaster ride 
fueled by sex, drugs and money. Promising his clients wealth while pocketing the profits, the 
cocaine-fueled Belfort gets richer and richer as corruption becomes ubiquitous. Not surpris -
ingly, DiCaprio is electrifying under Scorsese’s direction.
MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING
BY JACQUELINE KIM
Move over, Kenneth Branagh — there’s a new Shakespearean in town. While also filming 
blockbuster hit “The Avengers, ” Joss Whedon adapted one of the Bard’s most famous com -
edies into a modern setting (in his own house, no less), starring a “skirmish of wit” between a 
feisty yet subtly vulnerable Beatrice (Amy Acker) and a headstrong, devil-may-care Benedick 
(Alexis Denisof). Despite a low-budget production, the film manages to complement 
minimalist black-and-white cinematography with grandiose Elizabethan English, making 
Whedon’s interpretation of the play a delightful romp.
THE HOBBIT: THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG
BY DEVON MUNOS
Both visually and mentally stimulating, “The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, ” did not 
disappoint moviegoers returning for Peter Jackson’s latest epic. Incredible CGI effects bring 
to life the journey that the dwarves and hobbit continue on, led by Thorin Oakenshield 
(Richard Armitage) as they head to take possession of the Lonely Mountain from dragon 
Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch). Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) leaves the group to 
fight evil surfacing elsewhere. “Smaug” perfects the balance between adventure, camaraderie 
and comedy, offering an undeniable box office success.BLACKFISH
BY DEVON MUNOS
“Blackfish” is making waves in media as an expose on the captivity of killer whales in 
theme parks like Sea World. The documentary follows the life of Tilikum, an orca who killed 
two trainers and a civilian who entered the whale’s facility illegally. “Blackfish” places the 
blame of the deaths not on the whale, but on the marine parks’ mistakes. Audiences thus 
question the imprisonment of large, intelligent, sea-dwelling creatures in undersized quarters.AMERICAN HUSTLE
BY DEVON MUNOS
Dark comedy “ American Hustle” shows audiences the high stakes that come when convicts try 
to scam crooks bigger than themselves. Exceptional acting by an A-list cast helps depict the twisted 
lives of con artists Irving (Christian Bale) and Sydney (Amy Adams), who are forced to trap politi -
cians and mobsters at the demand of ambitious, over-eager FBI agent Richie (Bradley Cooper) as he 
attempts to bust those behind 1970s ABSCAM scandal. “Hustle” uncovers how the instinct to survive 
corrupts a world beyond the con artist.
“YEEZUS” — KANYE WEST
BY ETHAN FUKUTO
Few would dare compare themselves to Jesus. But Kanye West is daring. And 
it’s exceedingly evident on “Y eezus, ” a lean, aesthetically sharp album brimming 
with audacity and aggressive passion. The production is minimal yet harsh, with 
industrial-style synths and beats that complement Kanye’s often enraged raps. 
He’s at the top of his game, and he knows it. Whether Kanye is a genius or an 
arrogant ass, it’s hard not to call “Yeezus” anything short of fantastic.INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS
BY EMILY BENDER
Joel and Ethan Coen evoke ’60s Greenwich Village with a story loosely based on the life of 
Dave Van Ronk, a folk musician whose career was overshadowed by Bob Dylan. Oscar Isaac 
plays aspiring singer-songwriter Llewyn Davis, who struggles to keep his music career afloat. 
Accompanied by a beautiful soundtrack, the film shows Isaac oscillating between hopefulness 
and despair. And what’s a Coen brothers film without an appearance by John Goodman, who 
is as snarky as ever as an aging, crippled jazz musician?
“OVERGROWN” — JAMES BLAKE
BY NILU KARIMI
The first line says it all: “Y ou’re on your own, in a world you’ve grown. ”  
“Retrograde” actually grows. First, Blake’s hum echoes like the distant call 
of a bird; then, he strategically adds new layers of sound, moving the audi -
ence through the haunting repetition of “We’re alone now” and building up 
to climax with the cathartic line, “Suddenly, I’m hit. ” Gradually, the sound 
strips away, morphing into a silence that makes whatever room you’re in 
feel empty. 12 YEARS A SLAVE
BY EMILY BENDER
Director Steve McQueen’s latest film is not for the faint of heart. Based on the 1853 autobiography 
of a free black man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery, the film depicts the dehumanization 
of slaves and the diseased social order that has plagued the American collective conscience for 
centuries. With support from Michael Fassbender and Brad Pitt, it is lead actor Chiwetel Ejiofor — 
undoubtedly a contender for Best Actor — who anchors the film with dignity and refinement.
“REFLEKTOR” — ARCADE FIRE
BY EMILY BENDER
Since Arcade Fire won the Album of the Y ear Grammy Award for 2011’s  
“The Suburbs, ” anticipation for a new release from the Canadian band has 
been palpable. And Arcade Fire delivered. “Reflektor” is a kaleidoscopic double 
alb,um whose lyrics about love, rebellion and mourning evoke the myth of 
Orpheus and Eurydice (Auguste Rodin’s statue of the pair dons the album 
cover). Few bands can combine neo-Italo disco, bilingual vocals and a David 
Bowie cameo, but Arcade Fire pulls it off.1

ILLUSTRATION BY JEFFREY LAU /GUARDIANWEEKEND  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | T HURSDAY , JANUARY 9, 2014 | WWW. UCSDGUARDIAN .ORG ! SONGS“ROYALS” — LORDE
BY EMILY BENDER
Just when the teen-pop industry thought it knew what teenagers really cared about, 17-year 
old New Zealander Lorde appeared out of nowhere, delivering an anti-pop pop song critiquing 
luxury culture and materialistic delusion. The track, which debuted at No. 1 in March, pulsates 
with subtle beats and echoing finger snaps, adorned with cooing harmonies. The simple arrange -
ment highlights the lyrics, in which the disillusioned singer sneers, “That kind of luxe just ain’t 
for us. ”
“THE WIRE” — HAIM
BY RACHEL HUANG 
Sometimes you need a good, head-bobbing theme to get pumped, and Haim’s “The Wire” 
delivers just that. With husky, staccato vocals, belt-worthy lyrics and a delightedly energetic 
beat, the Los Angeles-based trio of sisters Este Arielle, Danielle Sari and Alana Mychal Haim 
unite ‘80s pop with modern sensibilities in a hit that yanks you in with the irresistible urge 
to dance. This rad tune will latch onto your brain and hold there forevermore, bopping fever -
ishly on with the tenacity of a classic rock hit.“PARACOSM” — WASHED OUT
BY RACHEL HUANG
You’re  i n  a  f ai r y  w o o d ;  s of t  amb e r  l i g ht  f i lt e r s  t h rou g h  s w ay i n g  fo l i a g e  as a 
laughing breeze entrances you — so goes “Paracosm, ” the aptly named sopho -
more album from Ernest Greene (aka W ashed Out). A refreshing exploration 
in feel-good synth (think Toro y Moi), catchy progressions, seamless transitions 
and an extended love song to the mysticism of the natural world, “Paracosm” 
takes listeners to a realm of fantasy and vibrancy, and does it with the aplomb of 
a child’s purest imagination. “REFLEKTOR” — ARCADE FIRE
BY ETHAN FUKUTO
“Indie rock” concerts are typically characterized by a crowd of people too awkward — or 
too cool, perhaps — to dance. So Arcade Fire, being the indie band it is, doesn’t typically make 
music to dance to. They threw that notion out the window when they released the upbeat dis -
co-meets-art rock “Reflektor. ” It’s eccentric, with a dense assemblage of instruments backed by 
a pulsing beat, and even features vocals from David Bowie. What’s not to like?“THE NEXT DAY” — DAVID BOWIE
BY NILU KARIMI
After 10 years of silence, Bowie is back. Much like its title, this album feels 
fresh as a new day, combining the rock ‘n’ roll of his 1972 album, “Ziggy Stardust, ” 
with the otherworldliness of 1970’s “The Man Who Sold the World. ” Bowie cre -
ates music and lyrics that transport the audience into the future, to a place where 
he has reincarnated once again, exclaiming to the world in this new album, “Here 
I am, not quite dying. ”“WHERE ARE WE NOW?” — DAVID BOWIE
BY NILU KARIMI
The first line says it all: “You’re on your own, in a world you’ve grown. ” “Retrograde” actu -
ally grows. First, Blake’s hum echoes like the distant call of a bird; then, he strategically adds 
new layers of sound, moving the audience through the haunting repetition of “We’re alone 
now” and building up to climax with the cathartic line, “Suddenly, I’m hit. ” Gradually, the 
sound strips away, morphing into a silence that makes whatever room you’re in feel empty.
“GRAVEL AND WINE” 
— GIN WIGMORE
BY JACQUELINE KIM
Amy Winehouse is alive. And Duffy is back on the scene (from wherever 
she’s been since “Mercy”). Well, not really, but New Zealander songstress Gin 
Wigmore sounds like a Winehouse-Duffy vocal reincarnation. But Wigmore’s 
no copycat. Sure, she’s got the smoky voice and Motown funk to match her 
contemporaries, but the Kiwi singer-songwriter has plenty of her own sass and 
poignancy. After all, she belts on lead single “Black Sheep, ” “Everybody’s doing it, 
so why the hell should I?”“ADVANCED FALCONRY” — MUTUAL BENEFIT
BY ETHAN FUKUTO
Simple yet surprisingly rich, warm and inviting, “ Advanced Falconry” isn’t a song of sub -
tlety. Sappy as it may seem, it’s a song about love. But up-and-coming folk singer-songwriter 
Mutual Benefit dresses this admittedly trite but universal theme with a soft voice surrounded 
by airy guitar loops, violins and light percussion. “ Advanced Falconry” is delicately layered 
and orchestrated, creating a sense of simultaneous longing and happiness.
“FEEL IT ALL” — KT TUNSTALL
BY RACHEL HUANG
KT Tunstall’s “Feel It All, ” off her newest album “Invisible Empire // Crescent Moon, ” is a 
quietly brooding fare. It feels stripped down, lyrically and musically, and showcases Tunstall’s 
earthy voice at the fore, bare and beautiful as it navigates a simple but haunting melody. Her 
hushed vocals are grounded by the rough twang of a parallel guitar melody on an otherwise 
minimal backing track, and, added to the mournful, vulnerable lyrics, carries an emotional 
weight that is powerful and enduring.“THE CIVIL WARS” 
— THE CIVIL WARS
BY JACQUELINE KIM
A duo calls it quits on grounds of “irreconcilable differences. ” We’re not 
talking about a divorce here — this is The Civil W ars’ surprise split, fresh off the 
success of their chemistry-laden 2011 debut “Barton Hollow. ” But just months 
after announcing their hiatus, the Grammy-winning alt-country band recon -
ciled and released a formidably stunning sophomore album that exceeded all 
expectations. Their sophisticated folk struck the perfect balance of polished 
and raw — slick enough for mainstream ears and rough enough to be angsty 
and edgy.“DAYS ARE GONE” — HAIM
BY EMILY BENDER
Twenty-something sisters Este, Danielle and Alana Haim are paving the way 
for a new Los Angeles indie pop wave. Their debut album delivers songs that are 
rhythmic and tough, reminiscent of ‘90s R&B act En Vogue, yet luscious and 
emotional, earning the trio comparisons to ‘70s Fleetwood Mac. Featuring catchy 
hooks, glistening synthesizers and funky bass lines, Haim evokes pop gems of the 
past while making the sound its own.“MISSON BELLS” — MATT NATHANSON
BY JACQUELINE KIM
Compare the mournful radio staple “Come on Get Higher” with Matt Nathanson’s Bay Area ode 
“Missions Bells, ” and the former begins to sound like a cheery jingle. The lead single off his most 
recent — and arguably his best — album “Last of the Great Pretenders, ” “Mission Bells” continues 
Nathanson’s usual melancholic themes. But there’s something punchier about the dark love song of 
“Mission Bells.” Maybe it’s Nathanson’s crazy falsetto in the chorus. But maybe the singer-songwrit -
er’s already sophisticated folk-rock repertoire is maturing.“POMPEII” — BASTILLE
BY JACQUELINE KIM
This rookie band is no one-hit wonder. British rockers Bastille may have had their greatest suc -
cess with their literate single “Pompeii, ” which charted at No. 2 in the U.K., but the group is one to 
watch this year. Aside from their other, equally well-read singles, “Pompeii” attests to Bastille’s stylis -
tic strength: booming harmonies, military-esque beats and frontman Dan Smith’s vocal range. And 
honestly, how many songs are about a historic volcano that symbolizes life’s obstacles?
“STEP” — VAMPIRE WEEKEND
BY KYLE SOMERS
“Step” is surely a contender for the most well-read song of the year, with obscure cultural 
references to Astor Place, Dar Es Salaam and Croesus. The lyrics are clever and fit the rest 
of “Modern Vampires of the City’s themes of aging and death, while the warm harpsichord 
lines and sweetly wandering melody sound as inviting as a thick blanket on a cold night. The 
music and lyrics blend seamlessly, helping “Step” outshine the impressive songs on the rest 
of the album.“RETROGRADE” — JAMES BLAKE
BY NILU KARIMI
The first line says it all: “Y ou’re on your own, in a world you’ve grown. ” “Retrograde” actually 
grows. First, Blake’s hum echoes like the distant call of a bird; then, he strategically adds new layers 
of sound, moving the audience through the haunting repetition of “We’re alone now” and building 
up to climax with the cathartic line, “Suddenly, I’m hit. ” Gradually, the sound strips away, morphing 
into a silence that makes whatever room you’re in feel empty.1

“Basketball was always an aspira -
tion of mine in middle school and 
the start of high school. I started on 
my varsity team when I was a fresh -
man, and at that point, I was think -
ing if I could get a lot better every 
year, I would have a really good 
chance of playing college basketball. ”
As the captain of his high school 
basketball team, Klie led Service 
High School to win its conference 
championship, averaging an out -
standing 19.5 points, 10.2 rebounds, 
3.9 assists and 2.8 steals per game. 
His performance was well-recog -
nized, and he took home the MVP 
award of the Cook Inlet Conference 
in both his junior and senior years.
A self-acclaimed “big nerd, ” Klie’s 
focus on education and his desire to 
become a bioengineer drove him to 
maintain a 4.2 GPA in high school. 
The standout soon earned 
statewide recognition when he 
was named 2013 Gatorade Boys 
Basketball Player of the Year in 
Alaska — a prestigious award shared 
by the likes of NBA All-Stars such 
as Dwight Howard, Jason Kidd, Paul 
Pierce and Chris Bosh. 
 “ A lot of people think [of] this 
award as performance on the court, 
but it also factors other things, such 
as community service and academ -
ics, ” Klie said. “Getting that award, 
I had to play well. I had a good 
senior year, but I was also involved 
off the court through volunteering, 
which helped. It’s really cool to be 
one of the fifty kids who win it, but 
I have to keep in perspective that 
even though my basketball is good, 
I still have a long way to go if I want 
to compete on the next level. It’s a 
great feeling; I was really happy that 
I won. It definitely was not easy. ”
After receiving many scholarship 
offers from other academically dis -
tinguished schools, Klie eventually 
decided to join the Tritons. “In terms of academics, the bio -
engineering program here really set 
it apart since that was what I wanted 
to study since my freshman year, ” 
Klie said. “ As soon as I found out 
about that, UCSD was the place 
I wanted to come. The basketball 
team is great, the coaches are great 
and it was just a great match for me 
and a great place to be for me. ”
As a freshman in Revelle, Klie’s 
daily life is not much different from 
other UCSD students. He enjoys 
spending time in his dorm with his 
two roommates who “make it feel 
like home when you’re not really 
home. ” He enjoys the nearly perfect 
seventy-five-degree weather, which 
stands in stark contrast to Alaska’s 
“rainy and unpleasant” summers. 
Starting a new life in college also 
meant becoming a newcomer on 
an already established team. After 
being the definitive leader on his 
high school basketball team, Klie 
starts fresh as he begins to work his 
way up the roster.
“It’s just the way it works, ” Klie 
said when asked about his transi -
tion to a college team. “I had to 
get myself acclimated. There [are] 
already guys having leadership posi -
tions, so right now, I just have to find 
my role, bring energy to the team 
and then from then on out, work on 
becoming a leader in the future. But 
right now we have a couple seniors 
who are the defining leaders. I just 
try to come in and do whatever I can 
to help us win and help the team”
One of these leading seniors is 
point guard James McCann, who 
Klie said he looks up to and strives 
to emulate.
“There’s a lot of guys that are 
great, but the one in particular I look 
up to is James, ” Klie said. “Watching 
not only how he plays, but just [how 
he] sees the game and scenarios 
before they happen. His natural abil -
ity on the court is something I have 
to learn and get better at to play on the college level. He is graduating 
this year, so hopefully one day I can 
be that guy and be the player that 
he is. He is the guy I look up to the 
most. ”
Although Klie is only a freshman, 
he has had an immediate impact.
Klie brings an energy to the floor, 
has an ability to attack the rim and 
can finish in the paint. But he admits 
that there is room for improvement.
“I have a giant list of things 
I have to improve on, ” Klie said. 
“Defensively being in the right posi -
tion, being able to guard all posi -
tions, quicker guys. Decision mak -
ing and getting better at reading 
situations before they happen like 
James does. Knowing where I can get 
the ball, reading what my defender is 
doing are the biggest points but also 
the little things such as fundamental 
things that I have to keep working 
on as well. ”
Klie and the rest of his team -
mates have their mind set on mak -
ing the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association playoffs this year and to 
hopefully win the tournament for a 
bid in the NCAA tournament.
“ Anything can happen during 
March Madness, so first of all we 
want to get in that position, ” Klie 
said. “Just to come out and play hard 
every night and giving the best every 
night is the most important thing 
and to give our best effort on the 
floor. Who knows what can happen 
after that. ”
As a freshman, Adam Klie is 
already solidly contributing to the 
team, averaging 9.7 points, 3.8 
rebounds and 1.6 assists, while 
shooting an efficient 49 percent 
from the field. 
It should only be a matter of time 
until he steps up to become one of 
the team’s go-to-players in years to 
come.Alaska Native Klie Makes an Impact for UCSD Basketball

Just over 4 percent of UCSD freshmen are student 
athletes, and only 7 percent of the total fresh -
men on campus come from out of  state. A true 
outlier, Adam Klie, the 6-foot-4-inch freshman guard 
from Anchorage, Alaska, fulfills both these traits.
Influenced by his father, a former academic All-
American athlete from the Missouri University of 
Science and Technology, Klie always had an affinity 
for sports of all kinds. Basketball, however, always 
stood out from the rest.“I played all the sports in kindergarten and 
throughout elementary school, playing in boys and 
girls clubs, ” Klie told the Guardian. “But basketball 
was always the one I had my mind on and enjoyed 
playing the most. ”
Soon after his introduction to the sport, Klie’s 
desire to play basketball transformed from a pastime 
into a lifelong passion.What

This past Sunday, the UCSD 
swimming and diving team cele -
brated its 13 seniors for Senior Day 
in the team’s last meet of the year 
against the University of Incarnate 
Word and San Jose State at the 
Canyonview Aquatic Center. 
The UCSD women (5–4) coasted 
by its former NCAA Division II 
rivals, University of the Incarnate 
Word (0–3) from San Antonio, 
who have recently transitioned into 
Division I. The Tritons took a defini -
tive team win with a score of 205–54. 
Despite the large margin of vic -
tory, UCSD was defeated by the 
back-to-back Western Athletic 
Conference champion, San Jose 
State. The Spartans (4–2) took the 
win with a score of 140.5–115.5. The 
Spartans went on to defeat Incarnate 
Word 180–70. 
The UCSD men (1–4) faced off 
against Incarnate Word (1–2) and 
narrowly lost 134–128. The Tritons 
trailed early and, in the end, were 
unable to cut the deficit. Incarnate 
Word secured its victor y by win -
ning 1–2 in the 200-meter indi -
vidual medley. 
“Today, with Senior Day, [the 
team] was ready to go, ” UCSD head coach Matt Macedo said to the 
UCSD athletics department. “We’ve 
got some work to do, but I’m really 
proud of the performances over the 
last couple weeks. ”
UCSD senior captain Nicholas Korth — a 2011 NCAA National 
Champion in the 200-meter breast -
stroke — added another amazing 
performance to his memorable 
career as he won first place in his 
breaststroke event. For the 100-meter, Korth finished with a time of 
55.90 seconds, which was only .79 
seconds away from the pool record.

See SWIM, page 11PHO TO BY BEATRIZ BAJUELOS /GUARDIAN FILEIn preparation for winter season 
coverage, I found myself scroll -
ing through UCSD rosters. In the 
case of the women’s water polo team, 
a squad which did not lose a single 
senior to graduation, I recognized the 
bulk of the names on the list. Others, 
like the men’s volleyball team, I was 
less familiar with.
I saw Johl Awerkamp, a name I’ve 
committed to memory simply because 
I was tired of being corrected by our 
copy editors for misspelling. But where 
was Sebastian Brady, a junior captain 
in 2013? Comparing last season’s roster 
to this season’s, I noticed a remarkable 
11 players, none of whom had aged 
out, were absent from the 2014 group.
“Unexpected turnover rate, ” which 
measures the number of players who 
choose not to continue despite eligi -
bility, is found by dividing the players 
who opt out of competition by the 
number of possible returners. In my 
quick survey, I did not include players 
who had been drafted professionally 
or those who have eligibility but have 
spent four years at a community col -
lege or university.
With this metric in mind, I looked 
at some of UCSD’s other teams.
What I found was not surprising.
Most of our athletic teams have a 
very high retention rate, no shock for 
a school that consistently tops the list 
of the National Collegiate Scouting 
Association Power Rankings, a list 
that ranks schools according to athlete 
graduation rates and academic and 
athletic prowess.
The women’s basketball team has 
the lowest UTR, transitioning all of 
its players from the 2013 squad into 
this season, while the men’s basketball 
team and men’s and women’s water 
polo teams had similarly low UTR 
scores (each lost just one player).
Coincidentally, the remainder of 
the teams I surveyed — baseball, soft -
ball, women’s and men’s soccer and 
women’s volleyball — were each miss -
ing three players. The highest UTR, 
outside of men’s volleyball’s 55 per -
cent, went to women’s volleyball and 
women’s soccer (20 percent).
All this was interesting enough. 
But I started to wonder if there was 
any correlation between turnover rates 
and winning percentage. The National 
College Players Association published 
a report in 2009 that ranked the NCAA 
Division-I basketball teams that quali -
fied for the Big Tournament. 
Michigan State — a school with 
a UTR of 0 — placed second that 
year, while 2009 national champions 
UNC had a relatively low UTR of 13 
percent. Florida State, the school with 
the highest UTR, did not advance 
past the first round.
But is the trend consistent for 
UCSD? The answer is unclear — or 
rather, the R-squared is low (0.49).
What can be said is that the men’s 
volleyball team (UTR 55 percent) had 
the lowest conference winning per -
centage out of all the teams surveyed 
(17 percent). Meanwhile, the women’s 
basketball team (UTR 0 percent) had 
the second-highest winning percent -
age of the teams surveyed (77 percent). 
It’s unclear what causes high unex -
pected turnover rates — an aberrant 
excess of injuries, inconsistency in the 
coaching staff, a lack of team chem -
istry — but if you’re a coach looking 
to pick up a couple extra W’s over the 
course of a season, it’s sound advice to 
keep investing in the players you have.
