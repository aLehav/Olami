Roughly 200 students and faculty 
members — wearing surgical masks 
and black tape over their mouths to symbolize censorship, and bear-ing signs with the slogan “ Art is not a crime” — engaged in a “silent march” on April 8 to protest the university’s ongoing investigation of visual-arts associate professor Ricardo Dominguez.
The university launched a formal 
investigation after Dominguez and the b.a.n.g. computer lab — a collec-tion of UCSD students and faculty who use technology as performance art  — staged a Virtual Sit-In during the March 4 “Day of Action” protest. There, he invited people  through online advertising to initiate a com-puter program he designed to over-load and potentially crash the UC Office of the President Web site. 
Approximately 400 participants  
took part in the sit-in. The program also redirected some links on the site to a 404 error message that replaced the typical “URL cannot be found” text with phrases like “There is no transparency found at the UC Police also investigate 
Dominguez’s involvement in a cell-phone app that aids illegal immigrants.

After a contentious student-gov-

candidates and the first incumbent presi-dent to run for reelection, Revelle College junior Wafa Ben Hassine won the 2010-11 A.S. Council presidency on April 9.
Ben Hassine, who is currently a campuswide senator, won 
the election by a margin of 278 votes over incumbent A.S. 
President Utsav Gupta, who came in second. 
The outcome of the presidential race was heavily influ-
enced by the single transferable vote system. Using the STV 
system, voters are asked to rank the candidates in order of

A recent UCSD study has linked 
drug use among teenagers to their 
involvement in social networks, their sleeping patterns and their proximity to individuals with simi-lar habits.
Assistant professor of psychia-
try Sara Mednick used informa-tion from an online database called the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to determine whether teenagers who have friends with poor sleep patterns are likely to adopt similar habits. Furthermore, it was found that irregular sleeping habits oftentimes lead to increased marijuana use. 
Mednick — along with Harvard 
sociology professor Nicholas Christakis and UCSD political-science professor James Fowler — examined social behavior within the networks of more than 8,000 students from the seventh to 12th grade. Participants were asked to answer surveys that included ques-tions about their sleep patterns and drug use.
The students were also asked to  
give the names of five male and five female friends, who were in turn asked to fill out the same survey and name their friends — effectively cre-ating a network. Participants retook the surveys three additional times, at intervals of three years. 
“We were able to track how these 
behaviors that kids were having the first year changed across the years, and how the effect of new friends also affected their behavior, ” Mednick said. “So, if I knew you as a friend and you started smoking pot, [we analyzed] how likely it would be that I would start smoking pot. ”
Using this data, researchers 
found that collective drug-and-sleep behaviors  extended to four degrees of separation in social networks. 
According to the study, if a mem-
ber of an individual’s given net-work sleeps less than seven  hours, 
the like liho
od of the original indi-
vidual sleeping less than seven  
hours is increased by 11 percent. Additionall
y, Mednick found if a 
participant reported using marijua-na, his or her friend would be 10 percent more likely to use the drug as well. 
The study also concluded that a 
participant’s tendency to use drugs increases by 19 percent if they have a friend who sleeps less than seven hours a night. Though the correla-tion was more dramatic between individuals who were direct friends, participants were 5 percent more likely to use drugs if an acquaintance within four degrees did so as well. 
Mednick said her discoveries can 
be explained by a strong social influ-ence among teenagers. For exam-ple, if you have a friend who rarely sleeps, you — through spending time with your friend — will prob-ably adopt similar habits.
“In order to have my sleep affect your sleep, we’ve got to be physically involved with each other, ” Mednick said. “It’s a more influential aspect — a more direct aspect. That way, we can actually hang out together, not sleep together and maybe even do drugs together. These are the social aspects of a strong influence. ” 
Mednick said she will contin-
ue her research by examining the effects of napping within a network.

Before results could be 
announced at the A.S. election at 
Round Table Pizza on April 9, the election committee had to address a number of grievances filed against various slates. 
According to A.S. Election 
Manager Vishal Kotcherlakota, current Vice President of Finance and Resources Peter Benesch filed a griev-ance against the Tritons First slate on March 30. Kotcherlakota said Benesch accused the slate of pre-campaigning by reaching out to stu-dent orgs through email before the official cam-paigning period began, and of posting fly-ers on the Chancellor’s Complex. 
In addition, the griev-
ance stated that Lynne Swerhone and Ryan O’Rear, current Muir College senators who ran for reelection on the Tritons First slate, violated elec-tion protocol by promoting their slate on the their KSDT radio show “Muirworld. ”
Kotcherlakota said the commit-
tee struck down the first complaint, but ruled that Swerhone and O’Rear had indeed violated election guide-lines, and prohibited them from campaigning for one day. Although Benesch appealed the ruling to the A.S. Judicial Board, a board consist-ing of seven non-council students appointed by the president, the board upheld the sanction. 
However, Benesch’s actions 
prompted a public apology from the Tritons First slate during the vice-presidential debates on April 5. Both Swerhone and O’Rear were reelected.  
Independent presidential candi-
date Tan Dhillon filed an election-day grievance on April 9 against incumbent A.S. President Utsav Gupta, who was running for reelec-tion. Dhillon claimed that Gupta, by keeping the Web site he had created during the 2009-10 election without specifying the year of his campaign, 
was being decep-tive. 
However, Gupta 
said the Web site was only active so the Guardian  could 
keep him account-able for campaign promises. 
The Students 
First slate also filed two election-day grievances against Tritons First, both for violating elec-tion protocol in Eleanor Roosevelt College.
In the first grievance, the Students 
First slate — represented by ERC senior Chris Westling — accused the Tritons First slate of posting un-approved election posters in the ERC common areas. 
“This directly targets the fresh-
men voters and gives Tritons First an unfair advantage, ” Westling said. 
According to both election and 
college protocol, campaign flyers must be approved by resident advis-ers before being posted in colleges. As evidence, Westling presented photos — taken by Students First campuswide senatorial candidate Noor El-Annan — of the posters, an explanation of flyer policy from ERC Resident Dean Rey Guerrero and a note from ERC R.A. Samantha Lee stating that she had not approved the flyers. 
However, the Tritons First slate, 
represented by presidential candidate Brian McEuen, said that the accusa-tion was a miscommunication. He explained members of Tritons First had approached Lee’s co-R.A., Cody Griffin, to ask permission to hang the flyers. McEuen said Griffin gave his approval without notifying Lee. 
“This is a misunderstanding and 
the problem comes from having two R.A.s, not on the part of the candi-dates, ” McEuen said.
Students First also accused 
Tritons First of “dorm-storming” — visiting individual dorms to cam-paign. 
According to A.S. election 
bylaws, disqualification — the sever-est consequence of a grievance rul-ing — only occurs when the accused party demonstrates malicious and repeated violations, or when the vio-lation is so significant as to change the election outcome. 
The most significant grievance 
in recent A.S. history occurred dur-ing the 2003 elections, during which Vice President Internal candidate Steve Y ork filed a grievance against a Students First! slate. Y ork claimed the slate had violated election proto-col by displaying campaign posters on April 10, instead of taking them down the night before. 
As a result, the committee — and 
later the judicial board —disquali-fied the entire Students First! slate including Vice President of External Affairs-elect Rigo Marquez, who was replaced by Harish Nandagopal, a candidate that shad run for the vice president of finance and resources position on the Students First! slate.
According to Kotcherlakota, the 
judicial board decided to overturn all three of this year’s election-day grievances, and the rulings had no effect on the results of the election.

For me, one of the biggest perks 
of Spring Quarter — though it takes a distant second to 
bidding the Making of the Modern World program a tearless adieu  — is 
the opportunity for artificial reinven-tion. 
While I personally have yet to sign 
up for RIMAC salsa classes or organic chemistry, if the sorority hopefuls hustling to the shuttle stop by my apartment in fuck-me heels mean anything, it’s that spring is the season of change. 
No better evidence of this fleet-
ing reinvention exists, though, than Admit Day. 
It’s a small 24-hour window to 
convince Mom, Pop and their new little admit that — barring all rumors that UCSD is home only to bio-nerds and KKK members in training — we’re actually a lively campus that promotes diversity, an active lifestyle and a host of other admissions-office buzzwords having little to do with our actual college experience. 
The student-org leaders and 
financial-aid officers crowding Library Walk last Saturday were are all part of a careful illusion that our school is an impossibly welcoming bastion of higher learning — where there’s always someone to offer a friendly smile or full-color satire newspaper at every turn. 
The strongest sell of all, though, 
is the unremitting SoCal sun, which somehow manages to part the clouds and shine down on freshman hopefuls in an act of divine interference on the second Saturday of April, every year, without fail. (Curiously enough, at press time, it’s in the low sixties and overcast. Excuse my resentment.)

It appears not even a race war 
nor Bill of Rights battle can permeate UCSD’s ever-victori-
ous air of apathy. This A.S. election season, voter turnout dropped a few percentage points compared to last year despite a supersized candidate pool and what seemed to be a brief spike in interest in campus politics.
Once again, Students for 
Affirmative Action Committee members — who officially endorsed Students First presidential candidate Wafa Ben Hassine — proved more powerful than the disinterested majority (who will ironically com-plain all year about how the Sun God lineup sucks and how UCSD is socially dead, despite having neglected their five-minute oppor-tunity to have a say). 
At the same time, in the face of 
recent unpopularity, current presi-dent and 2010-11 candidate Utsav Gupta proved that a killer cam-paign can almost topple the SAAC trend, along with the fact that he is the single best campaigner in the universe. (Sarah Palin best come knocking if she has any intention of bagging the U.S. presidency in 2012). 
What A.S. President-elect Ben 
Hassine can learn from her fellow candidates is that, in addition to her promises to lessen our carbon footprint and diversify our student population, she has been elected to represent the interests of all constit-
uents. Just as importantly, she has been elected to throw a yearlong $3 million party to help us forget we’re wasting precious youth working our asses off at a failing institution.
But if Ben Hassine only fulfills 
one responsibility this year, she should play the role of mediator to what is destined to be a feisty forum. No future president will ever get as much done as Gupta — he’s superhuman when it comes to the grindstone. The only way Ben Hassine can achieve similar levels of productivity is to unite council-members so they can get shit done together. 
As usual, campuswide senators 
are sure to clash: Inexperienced firecrackers like Deyna Roberson will be sitting next to seasoned strategists like Zoe Seher and Victor Flores. The cabinet is similarly loaded for crossfire, with odd-woman-out NOW! cheerleader Kristina Pham alongside Tritons First candidates Andrew Ang and Michael Lam.
Pham will probably run a similar 
term as current Vice President of Student Life Ricsie Hernandez — hands-off and Concerts & Events-focused — and Lam is likely to drift from the council like this year’s Vice President of External Affairs Gracelynne West. Vice President of Finance and Resources-elect Ang has proven either too headstrong (while ignoring sound advice) or

A.S. President-elect
It is my pleasure and honor to have been chosen by the student body to be qualified enough to 
represent them. I would not be in this position had it not been for the over-whelming support that the Students First slate and I  had been receiving all 
along. Needless to say, Friday night was an immensely humbling experi-ence.
However, getting elected into 
office is not an accomplishment. Campaigning only means so much until the year is over and the stu-
dents can check off all the changes 
the Students First slate promised to make. I will be more than happy to accept an accomplished status upon exiting office with a record that ful-fills our slate’s promises. 
Friday night, Tritons First swept 
the elections, taking most of the sena-torial seats and two out of the three vice presidential positions. Contrary 
to what some may think, I believe 
that the goals of both Tritons First and Students First align. Together, we are a group of committed individu-als who are looking to make paying college dues easier, cut waste from the annual budget, promote environ-mental sustainability, ensure student safety and enhance student life to 
make it more exciting.
Throughout 
my campaign, I spoke a lot about insti-tutionalizing activism in the UCSD commu-nity and within the Associated Students. This 
activism entails 
several aspects.
First, I want 
to see the A.S. Council make 
more informed funding decisions, spend money in a sustainable manner  
and revise the budget to cut waste. I will be chartering a committee soon that will be responsible for doing this. This committee will then present to council a couple of weeks before we pass the budget, allowing for any changes to be made after hearing their recommendations. I will also be working very closely with my friend and colleague Andrew Ang — vice president of finance and resources elect — to carry out said reforms.
Second, as president, I want to 
ensure that our A.S. Council is com-mitted to seeing a more environmen-
tally sustainable campus. We need to 
focus on furthering our sustainability efforts, and this can be done in a myriad of ways. Styrofoam in Price Center, the sale of bottled water and the lack of bike lanes on this campus are but a few of our school’s environ-mentally unsound characteristics. 
Of course, the initiating step to 
repair said issues is voting in a posi-tion for associate vice president of sustainability. This position would be a working liaison between the Student Sustainability Collective and the A.S. Council. The AVP would also conduct a yearly audit of A.S. sustainability efforts and provide weekly written reports of campus sustainability efforts to council. The AVP sustainability’s responsibilities are also external: The AVP would advocate for environmental policies at municipal and state levels, when students are directly impacted by said policies.
Finally, with the students facing 
even steeper hikes in registration fees next year, it’s about time that the A.S. Council dedicates its energy to fight-ing the budget cuts. We are in a crisis of diversity, and — working with 
Student Promoted Access Center for 
Education and Service — we have to fight for a more diverse student makeup through sustainable outreach to historically underrepresented com-munities. 
We are also in a crisis of privatiza-
tion. The California Master Plan for Higher Education’s promise of free public education has been ripped to 
shreds. Unified as a student body, we 
cannot stand up for that. We need an A.S. Council that is not afraid to get political and be biased for the students: We need to empower students of all backgrounds to shape our school’s future. Some of the most important happenings of this upcom-ing year are the California guberna-torial and midterm elections. I will work closely with the vice president of external affairs to bring each can-didate to our campus and allow the students to be well-educated before casting ballots. 
Besides attending all UC Board of 
Regents meetings, I would also like to have our council go on lobbying visits together. If finances permit, council-members will be expected to go on quarterly lobbying visits. Working with the vice president of student life, 
the trip can serve as a retreat and an 
opportunity for the A.S. Council to be better informed and, subsequently, put greater pressure on California legislators to reprioritize public edu-cation when passing the budget. 
Above all, I am looking forward 
to a year of service and keeping the students’ interests at heart, both with local administration and external 
elected officials. Thank you, and I 
hope to serve you well.

Whether a clairvoyant meteorolo-
gist is enslaved in a heavily guarded 
room in the admissions office, I can’t be sure. But I do know that — for anyone whose home lies north of the La Jolla bubble — a campus flooded in sunshine and free food is a pretty strong sales pitch. 
It’s also a misleading one. Of 
course, nowhere in any student-led campus tour or UCSD brochure might new freshmen — ink still wet on their Statements of Intent to Register — find any mention of the infuriating tangle of red tape at this university inhibiting everything from enrolling in classes needed to gradu-ate on time to picking up a care pack-age from home after 4 p.m. 
And why would they? Wasting a 
Saturday on the real UCSD experience — the one comprised of Grade-D din-
ing-hall mys-tery meat and lecture halls so huge they require prescrip-tion glasses — wouldn’t serve any-one’s inter-ests. 
Naturally, 
tablers on Admit Day (myself not excluded) are desperate for fresh meat to fill their soon-spacier org meetings. I can’t help but think, though, 
after witnessing so much staged Library Walk merrymaking, that despite all the bureaucracy and undercooked chicken, it’s too bad the greatness of this place doesn’t stand on its own. Last I checked, the beach isn’t a short walk from UCLA or Berkeley, nor can they boast the almighty presence of Ben and Jerry in their dining halls. 
Perhaps our admissions office 
doesn’t rank those advantages as highly as pamphlet-friendly headers like “diversity” or “community” — but it’s a shame the three-ring admissions circus overshadows what small joys UCSD actually can offer on the pretti-est day of the year.

▶ END,  MYVTWHNLDear Editor,
Thank you for your April 1 story 
“E-mail Mishap Raises Concerns Over I-House Admissions Process, ” about the discriminatory, race-based admissions process at the International House. I am “John, ” the student mentioned in the article.
I am writing in response to 
Jeremy McGrew, who told the Guardian  that “anyone who is try-
ing to criticize the setup of this, or how they run it, is trying to throw a wrench in something that’s moving very smoothly. ”
The system of using race in 
housing is not a “good setup. ” In Eleanor Roosevelt College’s writing series Making of the Modern World, we learned how white people once systematically denied housing and other rights to blacks. That was not a good setup, and it was racist. I-House should not hide behind a cloak of diversity when what it really supports is continual racism and discrimina-tion. In calling the I-House admis-sions system a “good setup, ” maybe he was not aware of it, but McGrew used the same arguments made by supporters of southern Jim Crow laws, who thought someone “crazy” like Rosa Parks was fighting some-thing “that’s moving very smoothly. ” We know Rosa Parks was not crazy; she was courageous in standing up to institutions and “good setups. ” Over something as trivial as a seat on the bus, she took a stand and we are now indebted to her as a nation. 
We stand with Rosa Parks, and 
we need to tell UCSD I-House staff that their defense of a system that denied admission to Mexican, Asian, black, white and other students based partially on race or national origin concerns is indefensible.

malleable to whoever scares him 
most (first, Associate Vice President of Student Affairs Gary Ratcliff, sec-ond, the Koala ). 
Speaking of the Koala , Ben 
Hassine is destined to become a tar-get. Though she maintained a ratio-nal stance during Gupta’s student-media funding freeze in February (if boycotting important committee meetings can be considered ratio-nal), she harbors an exceptional hatred of the controversial paper. A heat-of-the-moment, Gupta-esque reaction to kill the Koala  wouldn’t 
be uncharacteristic. Ben Hassine would be wiser to direct the council toward more constructive efforts to battle racial insensitivity. 
Another top priority this year 
will be training student representa-tives on campuswide committees to inform themselves on the topics at hand and report back to council regularly. Ben Hassine, herself, has had problems on such committees — mainly with attendance and not getting the word out fast enough to rouse a student army. One more sure path to empowering students from the ground up would be to fol-low the campaign promises of presi-dential candidates John Condello and Tan Dhillon, who advocated the publicizing of student rights and a system to keep RSOs in check.
But, like we said, priority No. 1 
for councilmembers is tossing aside campaign paraphernalia and finding common ground. With a council as divided as Gupta’s and a president without his singlehanded ability to lift projects off the ground, next year’s A.S. hamsters will have no chance of finding their way off the wheel.+W]VKQT5][\.QVL

On April 3, Wikileaks.org leaked 
Apache helicopter footage that 
revealed U.S. soldiers gunning down two supposed insurgents — who actu-ally turned out to be journalists with cameras, two RPGs and Ak-47s — and all those unfortunate enough to be the line of fire.
The tragic mistake, aggravated 
by  crude commentary such as “Oh yeah, look at those dead bastards” and  
“ All you gotta do is pick up a weapon, ” is a window into the training tactics used by the U.S. The callous remarks make it clear that some soldiers think of war as one big video game. 
Indeed, games 
such as America’s Army, Modern Warfare and Call of Duty have been used to train soldiers and help them deal with combat trauma. But in a video game, no matter how many ruthless rounds are shot, reality can always be reset with the click of a but-ton — not an option on the battlefield. 
A civilian can only imagine the 
psychological toll warfare must take on a soldier. But when war is desensitized to the point that the line between reality and fiction is blurred, the value of a human life is compro-mised. 
Not only has the boyish eagerness 
to pull a trigger has compromised our country’s public image, it has led to the indiscriminate slaughtering of innocent lives. 
—Anqi Chen
Staff WriterObviously, video-game military training isn’t a vestibule of 
human sympathy, as demonstrated by the recent video leak of a few helicopter-perched U.S. soldiers gun-ning down a group of journalists from a helicopter. 
However, the soldiers in question 
can’t be faulted for simply following orders — even if their humanism doesn’t translate very well to Y ouTube.
In the now-
infamous clip, soldiers discuss whether or not the insurgent group is armed, and fire only after it is confirmed the group is non-American. 
The screams of 
jubilation from the soldiers are unset-tling, but let’s face it: Soldiers are trained to kill. If a soldier 
were squeamish, or took too long to consult his conscience, he wouldn’t make a very good fighter — and could potentially endanger his squadron.
It’s not all ruthless violence, either. 
At the end of the video, members of the U.S. army are seen rushing to the scene to pick up wounded children. The children were originally inside a van, obscured from view — but, upon their discovery, soldiers are quick to help them. 
Though a video depicting a violent 
shooting is never pleasant, the latest from Iraq is no Abu Ghraib — just a display of tactlessness from soldiers who were following ruthless direc-tions.

Office of the President. ” 
Dominguez said the incident was a form of vir-
tual civil disobedience, a part of the body of work that 
Dominguez was both known and hired for at UCSD in 2005.
Dominguez said that university officials had been 
informally investigating him since January for his involve-ment in creating a cell-phone application that helps illegal immigrants safely cross the U.S. border with Mexico by leading them to fresh water and other forms of aid.
According to Dominguez, the university has threat-
ened to strip him of his tenure. Tenure allows profes-sors extra job security by requiring just cause before their contracts can be terminated.
Upon request from the UCOP , Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of UCSD Audit & Management Advisory Services Stephanie Burke scheduled a meeting with Dominguez on April 8 to investigate his involvement in the March 4 Virtual Sit-In.
A small group of protesters accompanied 
Dominguez to the meeting, where he asked the crowd whether or not he should go inside. 
According to Dominguez, the consensus was that 
he should delay the meeting until he had consulted a lawyer.
“The community said we could either hold this meet-
ing outside with these 200 people present as witnesses, or we would have to wait until I had legal counsel, ” Dominguez said. “We agreed to postpone the meeting. ”
Warren College senior and visual-arts student Holly 
Eskew asked the American Civil Liberties Union  to become involved in Dominguez’s case. She said ACLU attorneys plan to review Dominguez’s case this week, and will determine how the UCOP investigation relates to free speech.
Dominguez’ cell-phone app has received additional 
scrutiny from other sources. Earlier this month, three congressmen — Rep. Duncan Hunter (R–Calif.), Rep. Brian Bilbray (R–Calif.) and Rep. Darrell Issa (R–Calif.) — drafted an open letter to Chancellor Marye Anne Fox earlier this month, urging her to stop supplying univer-sity funds for Dominguez’s project.
“The issue is with the actual technology he is 
working to create, ” Joe Kasper, Hunter’s spokesman, said. “It’s problematic to Congressman Hunter for two reasons: One is that its sole purpose is to help foreign nationalities illegally cross the U.S.-Mexico border, and two is that its being funded by tax-payer dollars. The university can step forward and stop acting as a platform to help propel the technology forward, which is what seems to be the case right now. ”
Dominguez said he does not plan to alter or post-
pone the cell-phone project.
“The researchers and myself deeply believe in its 
conceptual frame — we believe that art is not a crime, ” Dominguez said. “We also believe that it is important to bring to the foreground the crisis that is part of the border, and to hold accountable those communities that just let people die in an unconsidered way. As long as the project continues to work in that way, we do not see why it should not continue. ”
Eskew said the visual-arts community will stand 
behind Dominguez throughout the investigation.
“We are standing behind him in terms of the value 
of his work, and as an individual, ” Eskew said.

date is eliminated, that vote is transferred 
to the second-ranked candidate, and so on. 
Gupta — running for reelection on his 
self-created NOW! slate — received the most No. 1  ranked votes of all seven candi-
dates. He had 1,153, compared to Ben Hassine’s 1,106. Gupta led Ben Hassine in every round of the elimination except the final one, in which 465 
votes were transferred to Ben Hassine — giving her a total of 1,991 votes, compared to Gupta’s 1,713.
Ben Hassine, who ran on the 
Students First slate, said the win came as a surprise to her. 
“This was such a hotly con-
tested election that the entire time we were in the dark, ” she said. “We didn’t know how we were doing, and everyone had different opinions about who was going to win. I didn’t expect it, and I had prepared myself not to win and made plans for next year if I didn’t. ”
She added that the STV 
voting system was a fair indi-cator of student preferences. 
“It’s like a thermometer, ” Ben Hassine 
said. “With the STV system, there’s no binary of ‘yes’ or ‘no’ , since the voters can rank on what they want. ”
Gupta said he was disappointed about 
the loss, but agreed that the results showed a clear preference.
“ A loss is a loss, and you have to learn 
to swallow them, ” Gupta said. “Whether or not it reaffirms [my actions as president] or not, I don’t think it really speaks to those types of actions. It just speaks to who had the best ideas for next year and who can get the vote out, and I think the answer is obvious tonight. It’s Wafa. ”
The Tritons First slate — led by current 
Thurgood Marshall College Senator Brian McEuen, who came in third for president — swept a majority of the executive and senatorial positions. Tritons First candi-date Andrew Ang won the vice president of finance and resources position, while 
Michael Lam, also of Tritons First, took vice president of external affairs. 
Additionally, Tritons First 
candidates Anish Bhayani, Adriana Garcia, Michael Raimondi, Zoe Seher and Jennifer Tzi won five of the eight campuswide senatorial positions. 
McEuen said he was pleased 
his slate took so many spots despite losing the presidency.
“If a majority of my slate 
won and I didn’t, that’s fine with me, ” McEuen said. “ And we did great tonight. ”
McEuen said that he would 
likely not be involved in the student council next year.
“[Ben Hassine] has good 
counsel, ” McEuen said. “I hope she listens to them, because that didn’t happen last year. ”
From the Students First slate, 
Deyna Roberson, Victor Flores and Adriana Garcia won campuswide senatorial positions. Ben Hassine said it was unfortunate that no Students First vice-presidential candidates would be joining her, but that it would not affect the performance of the council.
Independent presidential candidate and 
Thurgood Marshall College Council Chair Tan Dhillon, who came in fifth, said that he planned to continue his involvement in A.S. Council.
“I’m not done with A.S., ” he said. “I’m 
planning to come back as associate vice president. ” 
Associate vice presidents are appointed 
by the time the new council assumes office during Week Seven. 
Sixth College Senator and presidential 
hopeful John Condello — who placed fourth after running independently — said he was “super happy”  with Ben Hassine’s victory. 
“I think she’s experienced, she’s ide-
alistic and hopefully she can appoint everybody that can help accomplish her goals — and I’m glad Utsav didn’t win, ” Condello said.
He added that he’ d like to see Ben Hassine 
take a firmer stance on many issues.
“[I’ d advise her] to not be so politically 
correct and make sure that she can speak her mind more often, and not worry so much about offending people, ” he said.
Independent presidential candidates Joe 
Virgilio and August Ryan Brenner were not present at the election announcements. 
The results were delayed for two hours 
while the A.S. Elections Committee discussed three election separate greviances — two of which were filed against the Tritons First slate and the other against Gupta. 
According to A.S. Elections Manager 
Vishal Kotcherlakota, student voter turnout was 22.7 percent — down from 24.3 percent last year. Marshall College boasted the highest college turnout at 25.3 percent, and Warren College had the lowest, at 21.1 percent.
“I’m happy that it was a competitive 
race this year, ” Kotcherlakota said. “There was a diverse group of turnout, which is what a legitimate A.S. election needs. ”
Ben Hassine said that her first priorities 
will be to appoint associate vice presidents and charter a committee to start determin-ing the 2010-11 executive budget.

After almost two years of upset, 
the “cancer cluster” at the UCSD Literature Building seems to have finally faded from interest. 
The literature department has 
expressed its wish to close the case for good after three separate studies failed to pinpoint the cause of the cluster — and after university officials worked with the Building Committee to implement several cautionary measures.
“The reports confirmed to us that, as far 
as we know, the building is safe, ” Literature Department Chair Oumelbanine Zhiri said. “Because of that, the elevators are back to nor-mal. Life is back to normal. ”
An unusually high incidence of can-
cer among staff and faculty working in the Literature Building — eight cases between 2000 and 2008 — has been the source of public scrutiny since early 2007. 
Panic among those with offices in the 
building was heightened by a June 2008 report by UCSD professor and epidemiologist Cedric Garland, who pointed to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) being emitted from the build-ing’s elevator equipment as a possible cause of cancer. (Garland had also investigated a possible cluster in the Chancellor’s Complex.) According to his report, the likelihood that the building’s cancer rate was caused by chance alone was one in 3,333.
As a result, two elevators in the Literature 
Building were temporarily shut down, and staff were vacated from offices with suspected high exposure to the EMFs.

At this point, it’s impossible to tell you’re just steps away from the entrance to SD’s trendiest water-ing hole. Look for an inconspicuous gold handle jutting from of an ivy-covered wall, and — once you’ve made it inside — make your way to the left. The right side’s plush, oversized booths are reserved for bottle service, which will cost you about $300.
It’s impossible not to gawk at Syrah’s 
décor: white, porcelain parasols are sus-pended from the ceiling, and warm wax candles dangle from mangled tree roots. The front door’s floor-to-ceiling ivy spreads over the inside wall as well, inter-rupted here and there by butterfly- and moss-adorned brick and wallpapered for-est.
Most impressive is an oversized table 
for 12 where wine tastings are held every Friday and Saturday — suitable for vino virgins and winos alike — just sit back, close your eyes and imagine your somme-lier is mad and your drink is a very strong tea.
Of course, given it was recently dubbed 
a “hotspot” by Y elp, Syrah becomes more crowded than Geisel on finals week by 10 p.m. Not surprising, considering the list of cocktails and wines could take you years to conquer. The bar even offers the elusive Chimay — a fruity ale brewed by Belgian monks — and a more welcoming air than the other bourgie wine joints in town.
The best time 
to score a phone number is post-10 p.m., when the deejays’ house beats and top-40 mashups provide an ample soundtrack for scoping eye candy, while the French Gewurztraminer provides you the liquid courage to approach. 
For the best service on the other hand, 
arrive during Syrah’s happy hour — 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. — for $5 sangria specials. Or, show up with a group and split a bottle of wine. (Most are in the $30 range, but they can go from $22 for a domestic Pinot Grigio to $140 for a 2002 Cabernet Sauvignon.)
If you’re not a wine drinker, not to 
worry: Syrah doubles as a spirit parlor. Try scratch-made specialty drinks like the Caprese Martini — complete with cucum-ber, basil and sundried tomatoes — or the Gaslamp Lady, a sweeter, more palatable lime, grapefruit and cayenne pepper rim.

!=H@SEJ-AS/H=U%AOPER=Honstration, arguing that the university’s 
response was insufficient. Demonstrators presented Chancellor Marye Anne Fox with a petition with 1,300 signatures that called for immediate action, including a relocation of the literature department.
In May 2009, some classes were moved 
into Sixth College trailers, and some faculty chose to hold office hours at on-campus cafes or in the Cross-Cultural Center.
One participating student, who asked 
to remain anonymous, said the university should have at least evacuated the building while the studies were being conducted.
“I was most upset because — even if the 
evidence was inconclusive — the university was really slow to find new classrooms, ” he said. “I stayed in that building all year. The whole department was concerned. It was disrespectful and irresponsible for the university to not find an alternative place. It seemed like the well-being of the students and staff wasn’t important. ”
Environmental Health and Safety 
Director Stephen Benedict decided to hire UCLA epidemiologist Leeka Kheifets to investigate EMF levels in the building. Though Kheifets admitted that building employees showed an unusually high inci-dence of breast cancer and recommended further investigation, her July 2009 report concluded EMF levels were low. Kheifets pointed out that epidemiological evidence does not support an association between EMF and breast cancer in the first place.
The report also recommended that the 
building be equipped with air conditioning to reduce humidity that would allow for the growth of molds and fungi.
According to department chair Zhiri, 
the completion of the air-conditioning sys-tem will be the final step in the university’s public agreement with the staff and faculty.
“We feel that the administration has 
done what was agreed upon to do, ” he said.
Ninyo & Moore, a geotechnical and 
environmental sciences firm, was hired by university officials to perform a chem-ical-trace analysis of air samples in the Literature Building. The firm tested for various air-quality parameters, including temperature, relative humidity, carbon-monoxide levels, carbon-dioxide levels, ultra-fine particles and a broad spectrum of volatile organic analytes.
The firm released a report in December 
2009 concluding that it “could not find evidence to corroborate a health concern. … Based on all of the findings mentioned above, no further action is recommended concerning further specialized investiga-tion of indoor air quality in the Literature Building at this time. ”
According to Building Committee 
Chair and literature professor Roddey Reid, though the air-conditioning installation was expected to be finished by the end of Winter Quarter, the process was delayed partly due to the chemical-trace study, and he now expects the installation to be com-pleted by the end of Spring Quarter.
The installation of air conditioning 
throughout the Literature Building — a project expected to cost over $100,000 — was one of five possible solutions pro-posed in September 2010 by the Building Committee to “improve the workplace envi-ronment. ” The committee also proposed that the university initiate a toxicological study, make improvements to ventilation in the elevator room and replace the elevator’s hydraulic oil with soy-based vegetable oil — all of which have been completed.
A February 2010 study performed 
by the Field Management Services Corporation to measure the magnitude and vector direction of the elevator’s power frequency magnetic fields concluded that magnetic-field levels throughout occupied areas of the building were not unsafe. 
“We are reasonably confident that right 
now the building is clean, or as clean as can be ascertained by science, ” Reid said. “What it is for us to have all these mitigation mea-sures, it [has] allowed the department and its members to resume normal operations. It’s been very disruptive of us as an academ-ic unit, and has allowed people to move on from this very trying experience in the way of health issues. ”

ertarians living in a declared state of war 
against Mexico since 1994, using nonviolent avenues like the Internet to spread their mes-sage.
Dominguez partnered with the group in 
1994, leading to their joint 1998 invention of an online tool called Virtual Sit-In. The tech-nology allows protesters to flood and poten-tially take down certain Web sites.
Most recently — in a move that now has 
the UC Office of the President questioning Dominguez’ employment — the professor employed Virtual Sit-In on the UCOP Web site on March 4, allowing individuals to protest online during the Day of Action to Defend Public Education.
Before that, in November 2009, 
Dominguez created a Web site nearly identi-cal to the current UCOP Web site, announc-ing that a new “Zero Tuition” program was to be employed by the UC system. Several news outlets called in, believing the statement to be real.
Dominguez was also involved in the cre-
ation of a mock UCOP Web page announc-ing the resignation of UC President Mark G. Yudof.
Virtual Sit-In uses an HTML-based pro-
gram to target specific Web sites. For each individual that signs in to join the protest, the targeted Web site is forced to refresh — clog-ging the server and eventually preventing its use, just as if it were a real location filled with protesters.
“Electronic civil disobedience allows us 
to think about the question of art becom-ing a social manifestation, allows us to think about art allowing communities who do not have access to power to make themselves present and allows the unbearable weight of human beings to put a stop to the crisis that is around us — especially the juicy crisis of edu-cation, ” Dominguez said. “It allows us to see that art is an active space in public culture, and that it cannot be disregarded. ”
Warren College senior Holly Eskew, a for-
mer student of Dominguez, said she partici-pated in both the physical and virtual protests that took place on March 4.
“ About 400 of us did the Virtual Sit-In, 
and at the same time, we had our real bodies protesting, ” Eskew said. “We are reaching the time when we can compare our real bodies to our digital bodies and online environ-ment. ”
Dominguez was hired into the UCSD visu-
al-arts department in 2005, specifically for his work in electronic civil disobedience. Since then, he has become involved with CalIT2, acting as director of the b.a.n.g. laboratory — a group of students and faculty who use modern technology to construct social and political statements. 
“ Art is as important as science or engineer-
ing or philosophy, ” Dominguez said. “ Art is a space that allows us to expand the way that we can think of the future. This is a product not of activism, and not a product of politics, not a product of science — it is the outcome of artistic investigation. ”
While much of Dominguez’ recent 
work utilizes the Internet, he has experi-mented with a wide range of artistic media. Dominguez began studying classical theater in the early 1980s, later moving on to agitprop theatre — a type of politically driven perfor-mance drawn from the terms “agitation” and “propaganda. ” 
“In the early ’80s, I became interested 
in thinking about the future of theater, ” Dominguez said. “I began to theorize new forms of electronic theater, and we wrote a series of books — one called The Electronic 
Disturbance  and another book called 
Electronic Civil Disobedience .”
From there, Dominguez moved to New 
Y ork City to begin forming a body of research that would eventually lead him to work with the Zapatistas.
“I started working with the Zapatistas in 
developing an intercontinental network of struggle and resistance, ” Dominguez said. “We initiated the practice of electronic civil disobedience and electronic action in 1998, and there, we did a series of performances for the Department of Defense, Congress and many other communities who responded to the issue of civil disobedience as an area of interest and dialogue. ”
Since his recruitment by UCSD in 2005, 
Dominguez has significantly expanded upon the breadth of technologies he involves in his art, as exhibited by his involvement in *par-ticle group* — a group of poets, new-media artists and sound artists who are interested in “poetically” investigating the nature of toxic-ity in unregulated products that use nano-technology, especially nanosilver.
Nanotechnology uses particles on the 
atomic scale that can often create new com-pounds — which may, in turn, be toxic. One of *particle group*’s core projects has been the creation of a piece of equipment that acts as a “particle sniffer. ”
“It allows you to walk through the instal-
lation, sniffs you and then tells you the level of toxicity in your body because you’ve been using, say, Maybelline lipstick or transpar-ent suntan lotion, ” Dominguez said. “The response by the sniffer is a series of poetic scannings of your body. That’s the core vision of the *particle group*. ”
Dominguez said that his projects, whether 
oncampus or nationwide, always rely on the contributions of fellow artists and activists.
“Collaboration is at the core of the perfor-
mative matrix that I do, with all the different groups I work with, ” he said.
Eskew said that the close attention 
Dominguez pays to his students is truly an asset to the visual-arts department.
“He is equal-handed in the way that he 
gives to his students and his projects, ” Eskew said. “He happens to be one of the most spec-tacular lecturers, and the most giving, caring professor I have ever come across. ”

By Liam Rose
Associate Sports Editor
WOMEN’S CREW — Finally start-
ing to come together as a group, the UCSD women’s crew team turned in promising results this weekend at its last regatta before conference cham-pionships.
At the Berg Cup in Newport 
Beach on April 10, the Tritons’ nov-ice four-boat crossed the finish line in first place. Earlier, the varsity eight-boat finished fourth after being narrowly edged out by UC Santa Barbara. The novice eight-boat only finished fourth after being forced to overcome an official’s mistake at the start of the race.
In the varsity eight race, the 
University of San Diego pulled away early, leaving UCSB and host Orange Coast College to battle for second place. UCSB fought back and forth with the Tritons throughout the middle of the race, but managed to pull ahead in the final sprint to take second.
Nevertheless, senior captain Jesi Bennett said she was impressed with her team’s ability to hold up against stiff competition. 
“It was a good one, ” Bennet said. 
“We haven’t been losing by a whole lot, but we haven’t been jelling as a group. We’re finally doing what we need to do personally in order to do well. ”
She said the Tritons’ success can 
be attributed to a strengthening of their chemistry.
“Even though we’re supposed to 
row as a boat instead of eight indi-viduals, we’ve refocused on the fact that we all have a personal duty to make the boat go faster in a more efficient way, ” Bennett said. 
The Tritons were set behind in 
the novice eight race before they even started moving. While the start-er is required to wait for each crew to ready itself before starting the race, the official failed to notice that the Triton boat was chalked on a buoy, and began the race anyway.
As a result, the Tritons faced a 
severe disadvantage, but were still able to keep their composure and 
finish the race strong. 
The novice four race went much 
more smoothly: The boat earned UCSD’s only outright victory of the day.
“I am very proud of them, ” head 
coach Pattie Pinkerton said. “It was a very strong field. They came from behind and rode with quite a bit of poise to take the race. ”
UCSD’s final race will be at the 
conference championships in three weeks.
Pinkerton said she is hopeful after 
her squad’s performance on Saturday. 
“We’ve had a race plan, and we’ve 
been struggling with executing it, ” Pinkerton said. “But we’re very happy that all the things we’ve been working toward are starting to come together. ”
Leading up to championships 
the Tritons will race at the Western Intercollegiate Rowing Associate Championships on May 1 to May 2 in Sacramento.

Howe was one of only six Tritons 
to compete at UCLA ’s invitational, 
a high-profile meet that features Division-I schools from across the country, as well as professional ath-letes. Far from intimidated, Howe shattered his school record in the javelin throw by six feet with a mark of 220’ 6” to take the gold. The throw gave Howe the top mark in NCAA Division-II thus far this season.
 “When you’re [setting a personal 
best] by six feet, it’s really excep-tional, ” Salerno said. “Him just being a sophomore shows there’s really no top end for him. ”
Also competing at UCLA was 
senior hurdler Christine Merrill, who ran both the 100- and 400-meter hurdles. She placed sixth and fourth in the events, respectively. Senior thrower Danielle Thu — redshirt-ing this season and competing indi-vidually — placed third in the ham-mer throw while fellow senior Marie Archer placed fifth. Junior thrower Theresa Richards placed eighth in the javelin — an event won by former UCLA All-American Tara Ross. 
At Pomona-Pitzer, senior polee-
vaulter Donna LaFever won her event with a jump of 12’5.5” , earning a provisional Division-II qualifying mark that should send her to the national championships later this year.
Her sister, junior Stephanie 
LaFever, placed fourth in the 100 hurdles and fifth in the high jump. The younger LaFever will be one of several Tritons competing at the Mt. Sac heptathlon/decathlon this Wednesday and Thursday.
On the men’s side, senior hur-
dler Leon Baham took third in the 
400-meter hurdles with a time of 53.42, then placed sixth in the 110 hurdles. Sophomore jumper Jeffrey Head placed third in the long jump with a mark of 21’ 11.5. ” 
In the first national poll of the 
season — released on April 6 — the Triton women were ranked No. 2 in Division-II, while the men stood No. 13 overall.
UCSD now boasts a total of 18 
marks — including two national bests — ranking it in the top-10 Division II schools this season.
“We’re excited about both teams, ” 
Salerno said. “But the men’s team has really stepped up recently. ”
The Tritons return to action 
on April 17 at the Soka Peace Invitational, held in Aliso Viejo.

TRACK AND FIELD — In case there 
were any doubts, the UCSD’s track-and-field athletes used last weekend to reaffirm they are some of the best to ever pull on a Triton uniform. 
Junior sprinter Kelly Fogarty, 
senior distance runner Daniel Anderson and sophomore thrower Nick Howe all improved on their own school record, highlighting a lively weekend for the entire team. Howe traveled with a small Triton contingent to the Rafer Johnson/Jackie Joyner-Kersee Invitational at UCLA, while Fogerty, Anderson and the rest of the team competed at the Pomona-Pitzer Invitational. 
Fogarty bested her records in 
both the 100- and 200-meter dash, clocking a time of 11.74 in the for-mer and 24.12 in the latter. The times earned her first and second in the events, respectively, as she was surpassed only by Republic of Chad sprinter Kaltouma Nadjina in the 200. 
“It’s pretty amazing, ” said head 
coach Tony Salerno. “When you’re running 12-flat or a little under it’s pretty fast, but when you get down to the 11.7s, you’re running with the big girls. That 11.74 is really impressive. ”
Anderson broke the school 
record in the 800 meters only two weeks before — at the Cal/Nevada Championships — but still managed to improve his mark with a victori-ous time of 1:50.56. <ZIKS;\IZ[

7XXW[Q\QWVhistory of the UCSD men’s basket-ball team.
The final walk to the bench was 
bittersweet for Acevedo, who said he attributes much of his success to the people he played with throughout his collegiate career.
“It was mixed feelings — sad 
and happy, ” Acevedo said. “I just sat there in my jersey, reflecting back on my career. I had a lot of great times. I just hugged my teammates, thanking them. ”
But now, their collegiate careers 
behind them, Acevedo and Lawley are confronting the same dilemma all students face on the cusp of the real world: What next?
For both Triton standouts, the 
answer is, hopefully, a career in pro-fessional basketball.
“I’m going to play basketball as 
long as I can, ” Lawley said. “Just keep playing until my clock runs out. ”
However, Lawley — who was 
named to the 2009-10 California Collegiate Athletic Association first team and led the league with a 20.2 points-per-game average — acknowledged that the jump from UCSD to the European professional leagues would be a massive one.
Both he and Acevedo will be 
entering an elite pool of basketball talent. Although incomparable to the NBA, the international curcuit has a talent standard far above the Division-II NCAA.
Lawley said he recently hired an 
agent to help him score a spot in a European league, and is currently looking at professional leagues in Germany, Turkey, Australia and the Baltic countries.
But regardless of which league 
he ends up in, Lawley said his agent wants him to play in the first divi-sion — against “the big boys” — a move that will require him to improve many aspects of his game, including his physique.
“I’m a little scared, ” Lawley said. 
“ I will h a v e t o c h a n g e u p m y ga m e  and become either a [shooting guard] or a [point guard]. 
However, Lawley — who is cur-
rently training in the off-season to meet the increased demands of pro ball — said he remains sure of his abilities.
“It’s more a physical than a men-
tal issue, ” Lawley said. “I think I can handle it mentally, but physically, I need to get my body stronger and faster in order to be able to play. ”
Acevedo, who said 
he plans on explor-ing opportunities in European and Puerto Rican leagues, will face similar challenges. But even if he doesn’t make a team, Acevedo said he knows he wants to stay involved in the sport, even if it means working in youth camps — like the LeBron James King’s Academy, which visited RIMAC Arena this past summer.
Lawley and Acevedo both said 
they have recieved full familial sup-port for their decision to pursue pro-fessional basketball careers; Lawley described his parents as “stoked” on the idea. Perhaps equally committed to their welfare is their mentor and coach of the last four years, head coach Chris Carlson.
“I have the confidence that I can 
play international ball,  but I’m just scared of going over there all by myself, ” Lawley said. “I will be leav-ing a lot of people behind. ”
Both players were standout 
seniors in high school — Lawley at Tokay High School in Lodi, Calif., and Acevedo at Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, Calif. They had several options for playing ball in college, yet both chose UCSD — a school not especially well-known for its athletic program.
Lawley said there were three 
major pulls to becoming a Triton: the school’s academic prowess, La Jolla’s great weather and the caliber of people involved in the basketball program. 
“When I looked at the school, I 
saw a great group of guys, ” Lawley said. “They made me feel welcome 
and want to play with them. ”
After meeting the 
team and spending time with Carlson, the prospect of a blue-and-gold Triton jersey became increasingly attractive.
Acevedo said 
that while success at UCSD was rarely easy to come by, he came out on top thanks in a large part to Carlson’s mentoring.
“There is less time 
to study, less time to freelance and less time to explore majors, ” Acevedo said. “Coach was always telling us to manage time and keep up on our studies, and he really helped guide me and the rest of the players so we could handle basket-ball and school. ”
As many UCSD athletes can 
attest, Acevedo and Lawley have found the academic responsibilities that come with attending a top-notch public university difficult to balance with a full-time athletic career. Student athletes must jug-gle road games, home practice and workouts with their studies.
Because UCSD doesn’t hand out 
athletic scholarships, Carlson said there is added pressure on Triton athletes — obligated to perform highly both academically and ath-
letically while, in some cases, work-ing a part-time job. 
“I try to stress success in the 
classroom to my athletes every day, ” Carlson said. “Because they must be both exceptional athletes and exceptional students, I make sure they stay on top of tests, papers and all their other assignments. ”
Under Carlson’s tutelage, 
Acevedo has already fulfilled the unit requirement for a degree in communications, and Lawley is fin-ishing up his last quarter as an economics major. Both are set to graduate in spring.  
“Jordan and Tyler were both 
great guys, ” Carlson said. “They had to balance school, work and basket-ball, and they were extraordinary at it. I firmly believe that both of them will be successful beyond UCSD. ”
In the more far-off future, Lawley 
and Acevedo said they plan to uti-lize the education they received at UCSD to launch post-basketball careers.
Acevedo said he plans to cou-
ple  his degree in communications with experience in the pros to get involved in the business or coaching side of the sport.
Similarly, Lawley said he hopes 
to eventually pursue a career as a sports agent. He is currently look-ing into a joint graduate program in business and law.
“I am going to take the LSAT 
soon, ” Lawley said. “I want to be an agent. That will allow me to stay close to basketball even after I can’t play. ”
Both Acevedo and Lawley said 
the fulfillment they derive from their sport greatly outweighs the stress of an uncertain future.
“Stress? Y eah there is some 
stress, ” Acevedo said. “But I wouldn’t trade [basketball] for anything. ”
