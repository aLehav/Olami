An article by CBS8 states that there may be inaccura -
cies in the number of cases reported by the county as people 
who test positive may not be reporting it to their healthcare 
providers. Currently, positive COVID-19 results from at-
home rapid tests do not show up on the county‚Äô s number 
of positive cases unless those who test positive notify their 
healthcare providers. 
In the article, Dr. Davey Smith, chief of infectious dis -
eases and global health at UC San Diego is adamant that in -
dividuals who test positive notify their physician especially if they are high risk.
‚ÄúFor someone with high-risk conditions and don‚Äôt 
even know they are high risk, their doctor should know 
there are therapies they may be eligible to get and prevent 
them from getting in the hospital and dying,‚Äù said Smith.
In order to combat the rapid spread of the Omicron 
variant, UCSD is recommending, but not requiring, that 
all students returning to campus-owned housing take an 
at-home rapid test prior to their arrivals.
See COVID-19 , page 3LAW ENFORCEMENT
On Dec. 27, the California Citizens Redistrict -
ing Commission certi/f_ied maps of the state‚Äôs 
new U.S. Congressional districts. Following 
the decennial U.S. census, district lines were redrawn 
to represent new demographic changes in the country: 
these new districts will come into play during the 2022 
midterm elections. 
Per the U.S. Constitution, California, like all other 
states, is federally mandated to update Congressional 
districts every ten years based on the Census. /T_hese 
new districts are drawn by the California Citizens Re -
districting Commission, a group of 14 college-educated 
California citizens, with professional backgrounds, se -
lected by the California government. /T_he Commission 
is independent of any governmental entity. 
Under the redistricting plan, San Diego will remain 
represented by /f_ive congressional districts. UC San 
Diego  Political Science Professor /T_had Kousser men -
tioned a few notable changes within the redistricting 
plan. 
‚Äú[/T_he plan] takes San Diego's /f_ive congressional 
districts and re-sort[s] them in a way that more clearly 
divides us on an east and west axis, rather than‚Ä¶ the 
north and south divisions that were present in the prior 
plan,‚Äù Kousser said. 
/T_he redistricting plan also creates a new 50th dis -
trict along the Paci/f_ic coastline. /T_he district incorpo -
rates Coronado, Downtown San Diego, Mission Bay, La 
Jolla, University City, and the UCSD campus, essential -
ly splitting the current 52nd district in two. /T_he eastern 
portion of Claremont, Mira Mesa, and Sorrento Valley 
are now part of the new 51st district. 
According to Kousser, ‚Äú[the plan] doesn't notably 
create any newly competitive districts and allows each 
of the current incumbents a pretty safe electoral home.‚Äù 
Representative Scott Peters, who represents the current 
52nd district and which includes the UCSD campus, 
will run as incumbent for the new 52nd district in 2022.
Kousser also mentions that 50th, 51st, and 52nd 
districts will lean strongly Democratic, while the 48th 
district ‚Äî which includes much of East County ‚Äî will 
have a Republican stronghold.  
‚Äú/T_he 49th [district] is our biggest chance for a bat -
tleground ... most San Diego UCSD students won't be 
voters in that district, but many of them still may be 
connected because Mike Levin, current oÔ¨Éceholder, 
has created a lot of ties to students and political activ -
ists in the area,‚Äù Kousser continued.
/T_he 52nd district, comprising the South Bay region 
and Southeast San Diego, will become San Diego‚Äôs /f_irst 
majority Latino district by voting-age population. 
‚ÄúIt gives a voting group that has a huge and growing 
presence in San Diego ‚Ä¶ /T_he ability to elect a represen -
tative of their choosing. And that, in many ways, lives 
up to the promise of the Voting Rights Act,‚Äù Kousser 
said. 
/T_he California Citizens Redistricting Commis -
sion, responsible for drawing the new districts, was 
established with a group of citizens with diverse back -
grounds and interests. From a pool of 22,000 appli -
cants, the State of California selected 14 commission -
ers through a vigorous application process. To ensure 
that a diverse group of voices were present, the selected 
Commission had /f_ive Democrats, /f_ive Republicans, and 
four Independents, as well as four /f_irst- or second-gen -
eration immigrants, three members of the LGBTQ+ 
community, and three Black citizens. 
Commissioner Patricia Sinay, one of the 14 se -
lected with a background in nonpro/f_it work, spoke to 
/T_he UCSD Guardian about the Commission and their 
work. 
‚ÄúWe all have diÔ¨Äerent professional experiences. 
Several of us were community organizers or had non -
pro/f_it backgrounds,‚Äù Sinay said. ‚ÄúWe had two pastors, a 
sheriÔ¨Ä, and some were from the private sector. So it was In the wake of the Black Lives 
Matter and #MeToo movements, 
there have been greater calls for 
better police accountability for us -
ing brute force and ignoring or 
covering up sexual assault cases. 
/T_he UCSD Guardian examines 
changes that have been made to 
University of California Police De -
partment policy as well as the San 
Diego Police force. 
UC San Diego students and 
staÔ¨Ä have proven to be very vocal 
about BLM and police account -
ability on campus. On June 6, 2020, 
demonstrators made a protest cara -
van down La Jolla Village Drive 
towards Gliderport, chanting the 
names of Black individuals mur -
dered by police. 
In February 2021, the UC sys -
tem arranged plans to fund a Sys -
temwide Response Team (SRT). 
Under this policy,  oÔ¨Écers would 
be allowed to turn oÔ¨Ä their body 
cameras when it ‚Äúwould jeopardize 
their safety or the safety of the pub -
lic,‚Äù which changes the de/f_inition of 
a police force, among other things 
listed. /T_hese plans were met with 
signi/f_icant backlash, particularly 
from the UC San Diego Cops OÔ¨Ä 
Campus Coalition, or UCSD FTP. 
UCSD FTP aÔ¨Éliate and Profes -
sor of Literature Sal Nicolazzo not -
ed concern back in May 2021 that 
this policy funded weapons and 
gear that took away resources from 
addressing student needs.  
‚ÄúIf the response is, ‚Äòlet‚Äôs arm 
more oÔ¨Écers with pepper spray,‚Äô it 
seems like the real goal is to pre -
vent student protests against things 
like tuition hikes,‚Äù Nicolazzo said. 
‚Äú[/T_he SRT] is obviously going to in -
crease the budget, scope, and mili -
tarization of campus police, when 
instead we could be asking how we 
can foundationally rethink what 
safety looks like on our campuses.‚Äù
When asked about the actions 
UCSD is taking to encourage more 
police accountability, Associate 
Director of University Commu -
nications Leslie Sepuka told the 
Guardian that the university will 
continue  changing to best suit the 
needs of students by using data to 
help shape its policies. 
‚Äú/T_he police department con -
tinues to evolve and respond to 
best practices and the needs of the 
community,‚Äù Sepuka said. ‚ÄúGoing 
forward, accountability and trans -
parency will be supported by new 
channels for sharing feedback and 
data ‚Äî such as the publication of 
data on use of force incidents and 
community complaints ‚Äî in order 
to track progress, answer timely

A.S. Graphic Studio  A.S. Council Brief: Weeks 1 and 2
By  Nikita Cardozo /gid00004/gid00016/gid00015/gid00021/gid00019/gid00010/gid00003/gid00022/gid00021/gid00010/gid00015/gid00008/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
Week 1
At the Week 1 meeting on 
Jan. 5, the Associated Students 
discussed many diÔ¨Äerent issues 
aÔ¨Äecting the students of UC San 
Diego. /T_he issues varied from the 
unethical research of a professor 
in the anthropology department 
to the transition to hybrid learn -
ing and COVID-19 updates about 
UCSD. 
First, John Muir College Sena -
tor Daosiri Rattanamansuang dis -
cussed that it would be useful to 
have delivery services for students 
on campus. Students who are un -
able to leave their rooms would 
bene/f_it from being able to have 
food delivered from dining halls 
and Price Center restaurants. One 
way to accomplish this would be 
by incorporating starship food 
delivery robots, which are mini 
robots that are autonomous and 
self-drive to deliver food. Rattana -
mansuang also noted that ‚Äúthree 
other UC campuses already have 
them.‚Äù 
Eleanor Roosevelt College 
Senator Isabella Ramos then 
talked about how to help student 
workers with parking. Ramos ad -
vocated for student workers to be 
able to have access to parking so 
they can be on time for their jobs. 
Having parking spots speci/f_ically 
designated for student workers 
would help with this problem. 
Arts and Humanities Senator Rhi -
anen Callahan also highlighted an 
important issue related to the an -
thropology department at UCSD. 
Former critical gender studies 
faculty member Dr. Saiba Varma, 
has been accused of conducting 
research that violated guidelines. 
Varma‚Äôs research took place in 
Kashmir, which is currently oc -
cupied by India. Callahan claimed 
that ‚ÄúVarma went in to conduct 
research on the mental health of 
Kashmiris‚Äù in Kashmiri clinics af -
ter the militarization of their land. 
Varma allegedly demanded that 
Kashmiris discuss their trauma in 
Hindi, so she could translate it for 
her book.  
/T_he critical gender studies 
department released a statement 
claiming that ‚Äúthe colonial Indian 
state intelligence apparatus had 
appointed Varma‚Äôs father (for -
merly a high-ranking oÔ¨Écial of 
the Research and Analysis wing, 
the highest intelligence agency 
of India and architect of torture, 
counter-insurgency, and counter-
terrorism policies in Kashmir and 
elsewhere) and colleagues to draw 
up plans, including torture, sexual 
violence, and counter-insurgency 
as instruments of war.‚Äù 
Moreover, Varma claimed to 
bear a comitttment to decolonial, 
anti-racist, and feminist politics, 
yet never disclosed her upper caste 
background during the sessions 
with these Kashmiris.
Furthermore, Callahan said, 
‚Äú[Varma] was not honest and not 
understanding ‚Ä¶ and she took 
advantage of other people for the 
sake of research.‚Äù So far, the an -
thropology department has not 
addressed the public about this 
important issue. Earl Warren College Sena -
tor Allyson Muir talked about 
feedback she received from the 
students in Warren College, es -
pecially with lighting and safety. 
Warren College‚Äôs remote location 
makes it more dangerous at night. 
Muir mentioned that safety kits 
might be helpful for students when 
they are walking to and from War -
ren in the dark and asked other 
senators for their input to develop 
these kits. 
A.S. President Manu Agni 
then gave some updates about the 
UCSD campus. Geisel Library is 
open until 10 p.m. with masks re -
quired. 
Students with a D parking per -
mit will be allowed to park in S 
and B spots until Jan. 30. 
Agni emphasized the impor -
tance of students getting tested 
as soon as possible and as o/f_ten as 
possible. Students who have not 
returned to campus can ‚Äúrequest 
a rapid antigen test to be self-ad -
ministered 24 hours before they 
arrive.‚Äù 
/T_he deadline for all students, 
faculty, staÔ¨Ä, and academic ap -
pointees to get their booster shot 
is Jan. 31 or two weeks a/f_ter six 
a/f_ter six months from the second 
dose. So far 13,000 students have 
received their booster shots. En- 
gineering Senator Samir Nomani online learning. /T_he 
shi/f_t has led to more 
UC campuses laying 
oÔ¨Ä people. One change 
is that all workers now 
have protected access 
to healthcare, whether 
they are on strike or 
not. 
UC Student Asso -
ciation campaign's goal 
is to fund UCPD and 
discussions collaborat -
ing with UCAB to im -
prove campus safety. 
/T_hen, President 
Manu Agni mentioned that he is 
trying to make sure professors are 
still recording lectures even a/f_ter 
the return to in-person learning. 
Registrar is working with fac -
ulty to update which classes are 
completely remote so students 
can add/drop classes before the 
deadline. AS will be sending out 
a memo that students cannot be 
required to complete in-person 
research during this time. 
Moreover, COVID-19 cases 
are at the highest they‚Äôve ever 
been on campus with 305 posi -
tive students on campus and 739 
oÔ¨Ä campus in San Diego since Jan 
9. During the weekend of Jan. 15, 
4,000 students are expected to 
move back onto campus. HDH is 
planning to add another 140 hotel 
beds a/f_ter isolation housing avail -
ability has decreased. Further -
more, all students who have been 
boosted or are boosted by the end 
of January will receive a $10 credit 
in Triton Cash. 
A.S. Council meetings take 
place every Wednesday at 6 p.m. 
and are open to students by join -
ing the Zoom link or Facebook 
live.announced that Price Center is 
administering booster shots in 
the west ballroom, a/f_ter UCSD 
has seen a signi/f_icant increase in 
the number of COVID-19 cases.
Finally, Vice President of Ex -
ternal AÔ¨Äairs Adrianna Black -
shire said that the UCSA Student 
of Color Conference will now take 
place remotely on Jan. 29; anyone 
from any campus can join. /T_he 
Students of Color Conference pro -
vides a safe space for students of 
color and allies to formulate state -
wide and campus-based steps. 
Week 2
At their Week 2 meeting on 
Jan. 12, A.S. Council discussed the 
important issues of remote learn -
ing and COVID-19. With the re -
mote learning deadline extended 
to Jan. 31, A.S. Council advocated 
for the smooth transition from 
remote to hybrid learning. 3 and 
4. A.S. members will be judged 
based on the quality of their work, 
planning and organizing, produc -
tivity, teamwork and more. 
VP External AÔ¨Äairs Adrianna 
Blackshire noted that during the 
January board meeting of the 
student regents, there was discus -
sion on testing plans and booster 
requirements with increased CO-
VID-19 cases. he representatives 
from the UC unions have dis -
cussed the issues with the shi/f_t to

questions and continually im -
prove.‚Äù
In October 2021, /T_he Guard -
ian highlighted James Steve‚Äôs law -
suit against UCSD and Regents. 
Steve‚Äôs lawsuit, /f_iled on July 
23, 2021, alleges that there were 
systematically-reinforced issues 
of racism, sexism, and homopho -
bia within the UCSD-PD force. It 
claims that his time in the force 
led to loss of /f_inancial stability 
and security, and had a detrimen -
tal eÔ¨Äect on his mental health. 
/T_he Guardian reached out 
to Steve‚Äôs representing attorney, 
Darren Richie, for a possible up -
date on the trial. However, Richie 
and other attorneys of DreLaw 
neglected to respond.
Similar news has followed 
from UC Santa Barbara. Since 
2019, seven lawsuits have been 
/f_iled from former and current 
oÔ¨Écers in the UCSB‚Äôs branch of 
UCPD. /T_he oÔ¨Écers /f_iling these 
lawsuits include Michael and 
TiÔ¨Äany Little, Mark Signa, Jona -
than Lee Reyes, Matthew Stern, 
Amanda Siegel, and Ryan Smith (
back greater levels of account -
ability,‚Äù LaCava added about the 
Commission. (who /f_iled a lawsuit 
under the pseudonym John Doe). 
Some of the lawsuits suggest that 
oÔ¨Écers have engaged in inappro -
priate relationships with students, 
such as providing underaged stu -
dents with alcohol.Additionally, these lawsuits al -
leged many incidents where oÔ¨É -
cers dismissed cases of sexual as -
sault and harassment. Stern and 
Michael and TiÔ¨Äany Little stated 
that they were demoted a/f_ter they 
reported oÔ¨Äending oÔ¨Écers. 
According to the Daily Nexus, 
‚Äúa/f_ter reporting several instances 
of harassment, [Stern] resigned 
a/f_ter being told by UCPD Chief 
James Brock that she had become 
a ‚Äòtarget‚Äô within the department.‚Äù 
Nearly all of these cases were 
/f_iled against the UCPD under 
allegations that the oÔ¨Écers vio -
lated the California Whistle -
blower Protection Act ‚Äî an act 
that prohibits employers from 
retaliating against employees 
who report violations of the law. 
/T_he suits allege that the oÔ¨Écers 
were faced with retaliation from 
other members of the force when 
they attempted to speak up. For 
instance, Signa‚Äôs lawsuit claims 
that an anonymous male caller 
warned his wife in September 
2018, ‚ÄúSorry, wrong number. Tell 
Mark Signa to watch out,‚Äù alleg -
edly in response to his whistle -
blowing. It has not only been 
oÔ¨Écers who have /f_iled lawsuits 
against the UCPD. On July 31, 
2020, a student going by the 
name Emily O. /f_iled a lawsuit 
against the UCSB-PD Chief of 
Force James Brock. She alleged 
that Brock assaulted her in Au -
gust 2019. ‚ÄúI hope UCSB will enforce 
measures to better protect their 
students,‚Äù Emily O. told the Dai -
ly Nexus. ‚ÄúI just want to make 
sure this doesn‚Äôt happen to any -
one again because this has been 
the worst thing I‚Äôve ever had to 
go through.‚Äù
To address rising concerns 
about campus police, the UC 
system introduced the UC Com -
munity Safety Plan in August 
2021. 
/T_he UC Community Safety 
Plan outlines guidelines for cam -
pus safety in the future. /T_he plan 
claims that the campus safety 
system will provide monitored 
high-quality service and the hir -
ing process will include partici -
pation from various student, fac -
ulty, and staÔ¨Ä groups. /T_he plan 
also says that a tiered system will 
match a call with the appropri -
ate service, ranging from mental 
health to emergencies and more. 
Moreover, the plan states that 
there will be a greater emphasis 
on deterrence and violent crime 
prevention over punishing mi -
nor crimes, that there will be a 
reduction of police at protests, 
and focus on de-escalation in -
stead. Most importantly, the new 
guidelines state that data collec -
tion will be used to assess these 
campus practices, and there will 
be new boards and positions to 
help ensure safety and improve -
ment.Sepuka states that this plan is 
to help make the UC universities 
feel more open, safe, and welcom -
ing to all students. 
‚Äú/T_hese guidelines focus on 
community and service-driven 
safety, holistic, inclusive and 
tiered response services, trans -
parency and continuous im 
provement through data and ac -
countability and independent 
oversight,‚Äù Sepuka said. Outside 
of the UC system, San Diego has 
clear issues with policing, such 
as race disparity. A report by Ac -
countable Now released on Dec. 
23, 2021, stated that San Diego re -
ported 15,018 uses of force by the 
police. Even though Black people 
comprise 6 percent of the popu -
lation, they made up 24 percent 
of the reports of force. Hispanic 
people, who make up about 30 
percent of the population, com -
prise 27 percent of the reports of 
force. 
Accountable Now is a policing 
report created at /T_he Leadership 
Conference Education Fund. It 
collects data from law enforce -
ment agencies, community mem -
bers, activists, and public records 
and shares it publicly. 
To address the policing issues 
that these statistics bring aware -
ness to, Councilmember Joe 
LaCava told the Guardian that 
San Diego is not at where it needs 
to be to fully address them. ‚Äú/T_he 
good news is that‚Ä¶ thereis a lot of perspective that there needs 
to be a change,‚Äù Councilmember 
LaCava explained. ‚ÄúBut we still have 
a long way to go to balance respecting 
those who chose to serve as police and 
the risk they put their lives in to deliver 
public safety‚Ä¶ with the accountabil -
ity that actions constantly have to be 
monitored and ensure that we‚Äôre really 
protecting everybody.‚Äù 
Since 2020, the San Diego govern -
ment has been implementing diÔ¨Äer -
ent measures to encourage account -
ability and to track public opinion 
on policing. On Nov. 1, 2021, the San 
Diego police department launched 
an anonymous survey to get citizen 
input on policing in response to ma -
jor local criticism. /T_his was notable as 
this launch followed the release of a re -
cording of San Diego oÔ¨Écers forcibly 
beating Jesse Evans, who is a homeless 
Black member of the La Jolla com -
munity on May 14, 2021. Additionally, 
on April 26, 2021, the San Diego City 
Council voted unanimously to create 
an independent police oversight com -
mission. 
‚ÄúI have great hope that a more so -
phisticated approach will bringback 
greater levels of accountability,‚Äù LaCa -
va added about the Commission. 
/T_he Guardian will continue to 
monitor the situation in San Diego.

one of several important con -
siderations of the Commission,

districts. 
‚Äú/T_he idea ... is that minority 
communities have an opportuni -
ty to vote for those that they want 
to vote for,‚Äù Sinay said. 
Sinay further explained that 
each district must be equal in 
population, ful/f_ill Voting Rights 
Act requirements, be continuous 
and compact, and unite ‚Äúcom -
munities of interest.‚Äù /T_he Com -
mission classi/f_ies groups of voters 
with similar backgrounds and 
needs under these communities 
of interest. Ful/f_illing these re -
quirements required signi/f_icant 
outreach eÔ¨Äorts by the Commis -
sion. 
‚ÄúIn January [2021], we [initi -
ated] phase one, where we did 
a redistricting overview,‚Äù Sinay 
said. ‚ÄúLocal political groups and 
students would invite us in to 
come and talk about redistricting 
and why it was important ... we 
spent a good six months really go -
ing across the whole state reach -
ing out to folks and explaining to 
them redistricting.‚Äù 
Following this initial outreach 
phase, Sinay explained that the 
Commission then continued by organizing these communities 
of interest, which form the basis 
for the new districts drawn in the 
plan.
‚ÄúIn that second phase, [the 
Commission] spent a lot of [time] 
listening to the communities to 
tell us who their communities 
of interest were,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe 
asked, who is it that you work, 
live, play, pray, protest with, that 
you would like to be represented 
with, and who wouldn't you like 
to be represented with?‚Äù 
Sinay provided the example 
of the newly drawn 25th district, 
which includes Riverside and Im -
perial Counties, due to the pres -
ence of the Salton Sea in both 
regions. 
‚ÄúPortola Valley, and Impe -
rial, were very interested in work -
ing together because of the‚Ä¶the 
health issues around the Salton 
Sea ‚Ä¶ and environmental issues 
connected to the Colorado River 
Basin,‚Äù Sinay said. 
Currently, UCSD is located in 
the 49th district, separated from 
University City in the 52nd dis -
trict. Under the new proposal and 
beginning with the 2022 midterm 
elections, UCSD and University 
City will both be located in the 
new 50th district, uniting a com -
munity of interest under one rep -

‚ÄúFor someone with high-risk 
conditions and don‚Äôt even know 
they are high risk, their doctor 
should know there are therapies 
they may be eligible to get and 
prevent them from getting in the 
hospital and dying,‚Äù said Smith.
In order to combat the rapid 
spread of the Omicron variant, 
UCSD is recommending, but not 
requiring, that all students re -
turning to campus-owned hous -
ing take an at-home rapid test 
prior to their arrival.s
Students returning to campus 
housing a/f_ter Jan. 7 can receive a 
free rapid antigen test mailed to 
them by /f_illing out the form in 
their housing emails no later than 
Jan. 21. 
Currently, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) states that individuals who 
test positive using an at-home test 
should immediately isolate, con -
tact their healthcare provider, and 
contact anyone they have been in 
contact with. 
/T_he New York Times states 
that at-home COVIDcovid tests 
have an accuracy of roughly 85%, but they are most sensitive for in -
dividuals who are experiencing 
symptoms. Because the tests are 
conducted by collecting viral loads, 
it may deliver false negatives in as -
ymptomatic individuals who do not 
carry large viral loads in their body.  
Individuals may not be inform -
ing their healthcare providers of a 
positive test result because they have 
little to no symptoms and therefore 
do not require medical help. 
A sophomore at UCSD con -
tracted the virus at home during 
winter break and immediately 
went into isolation, experiencing no 
symptoms.
‚ÄúI took a rapid test at home and 
that‚Äôs how I found out I was posi -
tive. I immediately went into isola -
tion and contacted everyone I was 
exposed to. I had no symptoms 
because I am vaccinated so I didn‚Äôt 
call my doctor as I felt completely 
/f_ine,‚Äù the student said.
Like this student, many people  
ple who test positive but have no 
symptoms isolate immediately 
but do not inform their health -
care providers because they are 
unsure if they have to or not.
Additionally, many counties 
across the country are experienc -
ing a shortage of at-home tests 
and appointments for PCR tests 
within the necessary time frame. 
Arjun Malleswaran, a Sixth 
College sophomore, is skeptical 
about the numbers of cases re -
ported in counties due to a short -
age of at-home tests and in-person 
testing appointments.
‚ÄúI know a couple people who 
could not /f_ind any rapid tests in 
stock so they had to order them 
online,‚Äù Malleswaran said. ‚ÄúIt ar -
rived a couple days later and they 
had quarantined until then but 
hadn‚Äôt noti/f_ied their healthcare 
providers because they weren‚Äôt 
sure if they were positive or not.‚Äù

When to Escape From Escapist Behavior
From this seemingly-
endless pandemic to personal 
issues that plague our lives, 
it makes sense that we often 
seek a place and time to forget 
about life‚Äôs challenges. For the 
most part, that‚Äôs perfectly fine 
and, with moderation, healthy. 
The intentional detachment 
and distraction from our daily 
lives, or escapism, is a natural 
response to stress. However, our 
habitual escape has transformed 
into numbness, and we have 
ultimately become avoidant 
to our responsibilities and 
problems. 
Whether it‚Äôs scrolling 
through social media for hours 
on end or dropping everything 
to rewatch the same Netflix 
show, escapism can take on many 
forms. Acknowledging the ways 
in which we practice escapism 
and setting healthy boundaries 
for ourselves is the first step in 
snapping back to reality. 
Part of using social media 
as a medium of escapism is the 
codependency we create along 
the way. When we spend too 
much time trying to forget about 
the ugly truths of the world, we 
end up defaulting to it instead of 
facing the issues at hand. TikTok 
embodies all of the ways we 
wish to escape from the world: 
It supplies us with an endless 
stream of content personalized 
for our viewing and allows us 
the space and resources for us to 
break from the world around us. According to a study done 
by the International Journal of 
Mental Health and Addiction, 
‚ÄúWatching videos of others that 
they feel emotionally involved 
[with helps] them escape from 
their unpleasant reality and this 
positive mood modification leads 
them to higher [problematic 
Instagram use] scores.‚Äù This 
would explain the reason why 
following and investing time 
into celebrities and influencers 
on social media provides us a 
medium of escapism.
However, the concept of 
vicariously living through 
others on a screen is not new. 
The same idea can be applied to television and movies: using the 
world created as a way to escape 
from our own. While this is an 
inherent part of the watching 
experience, consistently opting 
to watch shows and movies 
instead of facing the challenges 
of our reality can result in the 
same addiction as social media. 
All the ways in which we 
escape have become a prison 
for us. While it may not be as 
damaging, the addiction and 
reliance on our modern ways 
of escapism, social media and 
television, can be compared to 
alcohol abuse. 
While many justify their 
escapist behavior with their mental health, dependence 
on this method of coping can 
actually lead to worsened mental 
health. According to Psychologist 
Lyn Reed, by avoiding our issues, 
we could be at risk of developing 
a higher level of depressive 
symptoms. Additionally, 
she claims, ‚ÄúAddiction to the 
internet has shown overuse of 
such is often linked to loneliness 
and compulsiveness.‚Äù 
It is also important to note the 
other ways escapism can appear 
in our lives, such as overeating, 
gaming, and oversleeping. 
Admittedly, these actions are 
not inherently detrimental, and 
a healthy dosage of escapism can be used to destress and refresh. 
However, we must ask ourselves 
if the ways in which we escape 
are simply destressing us or 
inhibiting our ability to face our 
responsibilities. 
When we become too 
avoidant, it results in our 
inability to confront both 
personal and societal issues, 
leaving our responsibilities 
incomplete. Whether it‚Äôs a 
political issue on the news that 
you don‚Äôt have the energy for or 
an uncomfortable conversation 
you need to have with your 
housemate, escaping may seem 
like a tempting option. However, 
once escapism becomes the main 
source of conflict resolution, this 
addiction can impact not only 
productivity and relationships 
but also personal growth.
The first step in breaking 
away from our escapist behavior 
is actually recognizing when we 
are doing it, as it can oftentimes 
be a subconscious action that 
goes unnoticed. Once we are 
able to recognize how we become 
avoidant, we are able to set 
boundaries and understand the 
difference between leisure and 
detrimental evasion. Being able 
to deal with and come to terms 
with the ups and downs of life 
is a skill that takes some time to 
learn, but one that becomes more 
crucial as we get older and more 
mature. 
Trying to escape from the 
painful and uncomfortable is 
natural, but those responses 
signify that we care, we love, and 
are able to grow. By Raymond tran

Life is full of challenges 
and uncomfortable 
conversations, and if we 
spend our time trying to 
escape from them, we miss 
out on the value of the 
lessons they teach us.

Marvel. Cinematic. Universe. An American media franchise that has trans -
formed into a worldwide sensation. And whether the Marvel /f_ilms receive 
criticism or praise, there‚Äôs no such thing as bad publicity for them. It just makes 
them stronger. Almost like a superhero. Because at the end of the day, it‚Äôs hard 
not to marvel at Marvel. /T_he glitz, the glamour. /T_he hero, the villain. /T_he love, 
the loss. Good and evil, /f_ights and friendship.And everything in between.
It‚Äôs as buttery as popcorn.
And Spider-Man: No Way Home is no exception. It deserves its place on 
the Marvel shelf, perhaps even placed in the forefront. A/f_ter all, the movie has 
already racked up over a billion in the box oÔ¨Éce. Ka-pow. But the question 
remains: What makes this particular movie so desirable? What makes it so suc -
cessful? Is it the way it dresses? It's character? Humor? It‚Äôs /f_ighting spirit?
For one, we are reunited with easy-on-the-eyes Tom Holland as Spider-Man. 
/T_he audience favorite looks as buÔ¨Ä and built as‚Ä¶ well, a superhero. Holland‚Äôs 
character in the beginning of the /f_ilm remains fun-loving, with just a sprinkle 
of na√Øvet√©. Or maybe a truckload of it. /T_his is because Peter Parker begs Doctor 
Strange to create a spell that makes people forget he‚Äôs Spider-Man, but tries to 
doctor it (get the joke?) while in motion.
And, of course, everything goes wrong.
While resorting to magic might not have been the greatest of ideas, it‚Äôs under -
standable that Parker would feel this desperate. A/f_ter Mysterio blamed his own 
‚Äúdeath‚Äù on Spider-Man and revealed Parker‚Äôs identity, the world became polar -
ized. /T_heir /f_ictional world almost mirrors reality as we see social media posts 
about Parker, rallies, marches, and even books about him. Director Jon Watts 
creates a colorful explosion of opinions as the fallout continues. Clever camera-
work that echoes the long-stretches and quick movements of La La Land enliven 
the screen. And the music by Michael Giacchino only enhances it.Popcorn for Peter Parker
Spider-Man: No Way Home Movie Review
It‚Äôs a dance‚Äîdown to the way a half-dressed Parker struggles to close his win -
dow.
Best friends MJ (Zendaya) and Ned (Jacob Batalon) add their own verbal 
choreography through quirky one-liners. More so, Zendaya‚Äôs pronounced role 
as Parker‚Äôs love interest adds a new dynamic to the /f_ilm.  In a way, her character 
brings a sense of sobriety to Peter‚Äôs happy-go-lucky attitude. Her running line: 
‚Äúif you expect disappointment, then you can never really be disappointed.‚Äù
It‚Äôs needed‚Äîbecause No Way Home has more blood on its face than the pre -
vious two movies. It isn‚Äôt afraid to show the dirt, the dust, and the damage. 
Even the death. 
And yet, ‚ÄúNo Way Home‚Äù still manages to keep the audience comfortable 
with its laissez-faire nature and somewhat witty jokes. Aunt May (Marisa To -
mei) never fails to bring a smile to a scene. Additionally, the banter among the 
three Spiderman characters (surprise!) is particularly refreshing. Both Andrew 
Gar/f_ield and Tobey Maguire act as variations of Parker, thus making the trio of 
‚ÄúsSpidermen‚Äù that much more entertaining.
Some older villains grace the screen again, notably Dr. Otto Octavious/Dr. 
Octopus (Alfred Molina), Ray Dillon/Electro (Jamie Foxx), Dr. Curt Connors/
/T_he Lizard (Rhys Ifans)  and Flint Mark/Sandman (/T_homas Haden Church).
And perhaps a Green Goblin thrown in too (Willem Dafoe). /T_he villains are 
needed in the movie as much as the heroes. /T_heir unique backstories and suÔ¨Äer -
ing are brought into the spotlight, making the scenes more thought-provoking 
than in past Spider-Man /f_ilms.
Ultimately, this medley of old and new faces is perfectly catered to the fans 
and doesn‚Äôt feel too cookie-cutter. From reunions to run-ins, ‚ÄúSpider-Mman: No 
Way Home‚Äù covers its bases in glistening spidery webs. /T_here‚Äôs something for 
everyone. 
So grab that buttery popcorn and enjoy.Kayla Swartzberg /gid00007/gid00006/gid00002/gid00021/gid00022/gid00019/gid00006/gid00020/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019

‚Äú/T_he world looks diÔ¨Äerent now,‚Äù said actor Ryan Renolds a/f_ter the world was saddened 
by the passing of iconic and widely loved actress Betty White, who died on Friday Dec. 
31, 2021, just two weeks before her 100th birthday. /T_he news brought forth a wave of posts 
in tribute to her proli/f_ic decade-spanning career from many celebrities who worked with 
her over the years. Some of these included Sandra Bullock and Ryan Renolds, who starred 
with her in ‚Äú/T_he Proposal,‚Äù Don Cheadle who was one of her co-stars on ‚Äú/T_he Golden 
Palace,‚Äù and other celebrities including Jamie Lee-Curtis, Seth Meyers and Dolly Parton. 
Former First Lady Michelle Obama took to Instagram to share her condolences saying, 
‚ÄúBetty White broke barriers, de/f_ied expectations, served her country, and pushed us all to 
laugh. She was also an animal lover and activist, and Bo loved spending time with her‚Ä¶I 
know our Bo is looking forward to seeing her up in heaven.‚Äù 
O/f_ten regarded as the /f_irst lady of television, White won the hearts of many over the 
years by starring in a plethora of shows and movies. She has made appearances on many 
shows throughout the years (‚ÄúDays of Our Lives‚Äù, ‚Äú/T_hat 70‚Äôs Show‚Äù, ‚ÄúCommunity‚Äù, etc.) 
but most will know her as Sue Ann Nivens on ‚Äú/T_he Mary Tyler Moore Show‚Äù, which she 
won two Emmys for. She would go on to win another Emmy for her performance as the 
sweet but dim Rose Nylund on ‚Äú/T_he Golden Girls.‚Äù /T_he hit sitcom showed the lives of four 
older women living together in Miami as they share life experiences together. Although 
they were widely diÔ¨Äerent, both characters, as well as their respective shows, were beloved 
by fans for years a/f_ter they ended. She wouldn‚Äôt let her age stop her, because at age 88 White would go on to host the mother‚Äôs day episode of ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù, which she 
won an Emmy for outstanding guest actress in a comedy series. SNL writer Seth Meyers 
recalls White saying in a tweet, ‚Äú...the only SNL host I ever saw get a standing ovation at 
the a/f_ter party. A party at which she ordered a vodka and a hotdog and stayed til the bitter 
end.‚Äù 
White started her career in 1949 on a TV series called ‚ÄúHollywood on Television‚Äù, and 
went on to produce ‚Äú/T_he Betty White Show‚Äù, her own variety show in the 1950‚Äôs. It was 
on her variety show where she faced backlash for featuring Arthur Duncan, a Black tap 
dancer, only for her to keep him as a regular, something that was not common at the time. 
/T_his however was not the end of White‚Äôs activism; in later years she advocated for animals 
and personally supported many animal-related non-pro/f_it organizations, both by donat -
ing and volunteering. She even published a book in 2011 titled ‚ÄúBetty & Friends: My Life at 
the Zoo‚Äù about her aÔ¨Éliation with the Los Angeles Zoo and her love of animals. Her lega -
cy continues to live on through her dedicated fans who have decided to honor her through 
the #BettyWhiteChallenge. /T_his challenge implores people to donate to animal shelters 
and rescues, which trended on Twitter with fans encouraging others to participate. 
/T_hroughout her extraordinary career, White touched the lives of many and paved the 
way for a myriad of people in the /f_ilm and television industry. /T_he enormous outpour 
of love that has come from both celebrities and all of her fans from multiple generations 
shows the impact she had through acting. White has le/f_t a noteworthy legacy that will 
never be forgotten, and we thank her for being a friend.

Take a look at legendary actress 
and TV‚Äôs Golden Girl Betty White‚Äôs 
groundbreaking career, and the impact 
she had on /f_ilm, television and the 
world a/f_ter her passing.
In her debut novel ‚ÄúNo One Is Talking About /T_his,‚Äù, poet and memoirist Patricia Lock -
wood refers to the internet and all its various iterations as ‚Äúthe portal‚Äù‚Äì a morally- des -
titute landscape in which individual consciousness is replaced with collective thinking. 
Lockwood‚Äôs portal is emblematic of the culture created by social media and our insistence 
on digital connection. /T_he novel‚Äôs unnamed narrator is deeply immersed in the portal, 
using it as a medium to navigate looming existential threats of loneliness, climate change, 
and the pernicious rise of a political leader nicknamed ‚Äúthe dictator.‚Äù /T_he interconnected -
ness of the portal belies its disastrous implications on real-life human connection: when 
the narrator is faced with personal tragedy, she struggles to reconcile her online persona 
with her proximity to trauma. Deeply existential, Lockwood‚Äôs novel interrogates modern 
existence and our overreliance on social media platforms.
 Dubbed the ‚Äúpoet laureate of Twitter,‚Äù Lockwood is intimately familiar with the 
volatility of internet fame. Her viral poem ‚ÄúRape Joke‚Äù propelled her into the upper ech -
elons of millennial authorship and solidi/f_ied her role as a de-facto authority on internet 
culture. Lockwood expresses such familiarity with online trends throughout ‚ÄúNo One Is 
Talking About /T_his.‚Äù She speaks the language of the zeitgeist, substituting long, protracted 
sentences for outbursts that are commensurate with the punchiness and informality of 
Twitter discourse. 
/T_his fragmented prose is most apparent in the /f_irst half of the novel when the narrator 
enjoys internet stardom for her viral tweet, ‚ÄúCan a dog be twins?‚Äù. Rather than disavow the 
trappings of online existence, Lockwood embraces them. She revels in the levity of Twitter 
humor, participating in the full dimensions of the internet to which she owes her cultural 
relevance. Where the /f_irst half of the novel ambles in its revelations of internet culture, 
the latter is exacting in its depiction of interpersonal relationships. A deeply- personal 
reckoning ensues when the narrator‚Äôs niece is diagnosed with Proteus syndrome ‚Äî a rare 
condition of skull and limb overgrowth, most recognizable where the /f_irst half of the novel 
ambles in its revelations of internet culture, the latter is exacting in its depiction of inter -
personal relationships. A deeply- personal reckoning ensues when the narrator‚Äôs niece is 
diagnosed with Proteus syndrome ‚Äî a rare condition of skull and limb overgrowth, most 
recognizable as the malady aÔ¨Ñicting Merrick the Elephant Man. /T_he narrator‚Äôs internal 
turmoil addresses a set of questions central to the coexistence of humanity and social 
media: Wwhat, if not the incessant chatter of internet interactions, constitutes real life? 
And more poignantly: Hhow does one maintain a presence in the real world while still 
satisfying the perverse need to be constantly online? 
 /T_he traditional structure of the literary novel and its emphasis on intelligible 
plot is insuÔ¨Écient when addressing such existentialism. In the attention economy of the 
internet ‚Äî   where a seemingly inoÔ¨Äensive ‚Äúsubstitute of guacamole‚Äù animates a /f_lock of 
aggressive Twitter commentators ‚Äî so little makes sense. Lockwood‚Äôs non-substantive di -
gressions are diÔ¨Écult to comprehend partly because the internet itself is befuddling. ‚ÄúNo 
One Is Talking About /T_his‚Äù addresses our unexplainable desire to stay connected online 
by co-opting the lexicon of online culture. Littered throughout the novel are references 
to recent internet trends; in the beginning of the book, Lockwood combines the verve of 
Twitter slang with larger apocalyptic preoccupations in a digression where the narrator 
remarks, ‚ÄúSHOOT IN MY VEINS, we said, when the Flat Earth Society announced it had 
members all over the globe.‚Äù Lockwood‚Äôs kaleidoscopic prose oÔ¨Äers a lens, however nebu -
lous, through which we are able to reckon with our own contributions to vacuous internet 
dialogue. 
 ‚ÄúNo One Is Talking About /T_his‚Äù is a novel about our fraught relationship with so -
cial media, the futile search for recognition on the internet, and the toll of excessive screen 
time on our ability to empathize. For all of her premonitions, Lockwood does not end her 
novel without oÔ¨Äering a hopeful model of existence. By the end of the book, the narra -
tor /f_inds respite from the portal by re-discovering the joys of human existence with her 
newborn niece ‚Äî they experiment with various musical instruments, traverse through 
Disneyland, and take comfort in the embrace of a /f_luÔ¨Äy dog. Only by fostering an intimate 
relationship with the baby is the narrator /f_inally able to dull the enticing murmurs of the 
portal. To resist the gravitational pull of the internet, Lockwood asserts, is to express our 
innate capacity for love and empathy. No One is Talking About This

In March of last year, artist 
Mike Winkelmann ‚Äî known 
professionally as Beeple ‚Äî sold 
a colorful non-fungible token 
(NFT) of 5,000 daily pieces he 
created. He sought to find a 
market for his unique art ‚Äî and 
that he did. 
Known already as a talented 
digital artist on social media, his 
work sold for over 69 million 
dollars at Christie‚Äôs auction 
house, whoclaim of being the first 
major auction house to have sold 
an NFT based on a digital piece. 
On Twitter, some individuals 
feature profile photos of apes 
against a solid background. 
They are known as the Bored 
Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT 
images and, unlike Beeple‚Äôs 
artwork, these apes are part of 
a collection that has recently 
been expanding beyond the 
blockchain. 
The apes wear varying 
attire with expressions 
often appearing nonchalant 
and disinterested. Their 
accessories include everything 
from earrings to vibrant 
pinwheel hats and because 
some ‚Äî like those with golden 
fur ‚Äî are rarer than others, 
they rake in higher prices.
T houg h i n it ia l ly 
unassuming and at most 
charming to an unknowing 
eye, these images are a part of a 
competitive and unpredictable 
market, with some buyers 
willing to dish out hundreds 
of thousands of dollars on 
a single image. Along with 
the purchase are exclusive, 
membership-only benefits 
such as access to the ‚Äòbathroom‚Äô 
‚Äî an online community ‚Äî and 
a fluctuating market that can 
increase individuals‚Äô NFT value.
These ‚Äúnon-fungible‚Äù tokens 
are unique and irreplaceable ‚Äî 
akin to rare Pokemon cards. A 
trading card, for instance, is not 
interchangeable with another 
trading card. 
NFTs can be purchased on 
sites like OpenSea and Rarible. 
For avid buyers, collectors, and 
sellers, NFTs represent something 
substantial: something they can 
own with digital certification. 
Though the images seem 
accessible and editable, the 
ownership aspect is undeniable.
The owner‚Äôs name is on a 
line of code on the Ethereum 
blockchain or other blockchains, 
though the latter is much less 
common. The blockchain holds 
data securely; they are in the 
same world of cryptocurrencies 
and bitcoin. The blocks of data 
hold transaction information and 
they form a chain ‚Äî thus the 
name. 
Original NFTs ‚Äî either in 
video or image format ‚Äî may 
not deter copies from being 
made by anyone, but the power 
of ownership is the main 
purpose behind purchasing. 
The transaction history and 
the metadata that holds the 
description of the item as well 
as the creator‚Äôs information is associated with the NFT.
As stated by contributing 
writer Kyle Chayka of The New 
Yorker, blockchain technology 
transactions are ‚Äúpermanent 
and transparent‚Äù  to all. Though 
the blockchain is the result of 
incredible energy consumption, 
the transactions function 
efficiently to be very open, 
insusceptible to modification, 
and almost impossible to hack.
Creators ‚Äî like Beeple 
‚Äî can reap royalties from 
NFT purchases when they 
are resold. The creator of a 
NFT, interestingly, also can 
still retain copyright and 
reproduction rights.
This blockchain market 
is special because rarity and 
desire for the product can be 
enough to propel the item‚Äôs 
worth. Bored Ape Yacht Club‚Äôs 
initial batch of NFTs brought in 
more than two million dollars 
even though it started off small.
Further, Chayka said that  
when one figure for BAYC goes 
for a high price, the perceived 
value of all 10 thousand 
authentic NFTs in the set also 
increases in value. 
When buyers invest in 
the work of creators, they are 
also paving the way for even 
more investment through an 
incessantly active market and 
buyers‚Äô willingness to get their 
hands on a valuable NFT that 
can always go up in value later. 
Buyers can know that 
they‚Äôre supporting the artist, 
but the rising popularity of 
the NFT field gives buyers 
the opportunity to flip their 
NFTs and resell them for much 
steeper prices. 
Regardless, this movement 
is positive for creators who 
not only share more of their 
works, but can obtain profit 
and royalties. 
The arena of NFTs also 
garners some critics ‚Äî some 
scoffing at the idea because 
they equate owning a NFT  to 
simply copying the image and 
saving it onto their desktop.
‚ÄúThe way I see NFTs [is 
like] going to a car dealership, 
getting the top-of-the-line 
car that costs you thousands 
of dollars but walking out of the dealership with just the 
paperwork for the car. That‚Äôs all 
you get,‚Äù Bradley Anaya, a junior 
from Eleanor Roosevelt College, 
said. 
What coincides with the 
world of NFTs is the metaverse. 
As the name suggests, the 
metaverse offers a virtual reality 
beyond the real environment. 
One would access it through 
physical headgear or even a 
computer screen. The metaverse 
can coincide with these non-
fungible tokens in that what 
one purchases can also appear 
in that realm ‚Äî like an avatar. 
NFTs are on a compatible 
Ethereum blockchain that 
means if something is used with 
Ethereum, they can be used 
there too.
There are plentiful 
opportunities for businesses to 
ride the coattails of the metaverse 
and place ads where they want 
to. Revenue would increase for 
companies when individuals 
continue to sell and buy NFTs 
based on the ads. Section 230 of 
the Communications Decency 
Act states that internet services 
and users are exempt from legal 
responsibility for content posted 
on the internet. This kind of news 
is even better for those eager to 
participate in the metaverse if it 
means more freedom for them 
to conduct themselves as they 
want.
According to the work 
‚ÄúClass, Assets and Work in 
Rentier Capitalism,‚Äù by author 
Brett Christophers, the term 
‚Äúrent capitalism‚Äù refers to the 
importance placed on rent-
generating assets and property. 
Despite the belief that this would 
all fade, the metaverse and 
properties in it echo the strength 
of profit and the capitalist need 
to prioritize monopolies ‚Äî 
sometimes at the expense of the 
working class.
Even Author Anna Wiener 
from The New Yorker states that 
the development of video game 
technology, like the extended 
storage options, allows for more 
add-ons ‚Äî all available for 
purchase. These charges are akin 
to that of perhaps purchasing an 
avatar skin or going into a new 
realm through the metaverse. 
Wiener also says that if the metaverse materializes, it 
will probably act like a video 
game  even if it‚Äôs temporary. 
For instance, those who play 
the wildly engaging Roblox or 
Farmville may not be shocked at 
the latest trend of the metaverse. 
The popular game Second 
Life paved the way for virtual 
reality ‚Äî and it started in 2003. 
The game also has a marketplace 
where individuals can interact 
with others and sell and buy 
items. 
Decentraland is also a virtual 
world platform that allows 
individuals to incorporate NFTs 
in the realm through purchases 
of plots of land. The platform 
is also part of the Ethereum 
blockchain, which means NFT 
purchases and sales would be 
seamless.
Virtual reality exists with 
headsets like the Oculus ‚Äî 
something that goes for a few 
hundred dollars. Additionally, 
stores like Walmart have already 
experimented with a short video 
of how shopping can look like 
through an avatar  ‚Äî from buying 
milk to a whole television set. 
The concepts of the metaverse 
are not new and unheard of. 
Based on the video and where 
NFTs are going, the metaverse 
isn‚Äôt a pipe dream either. It also 
won‚Äôt stay limited to games.
Not only have tickets to 
concerts had the chance to be 
substituted by NFTs, virtual 
concerts in collaboration with 
Roblox bloomed as ways for 
individuals to feel the thrill of 
the artists and audience. Skate 
stores like Vans teamed up with 
Roblox for the first ever virtual 
skate park ‚Äî with interaction 
through skating in the virtual 
world as well as Vans gear such 
as shoes and hats all for sale.
Staff Writer Cecilia 
D‚ÄôAnastasio from Wired focused 
on how the metaverse is really a 
simple version of online games 
many have already been playing 
but what makes the metaverse 
so fascinating can ultimately be 
greed or infeasibility at the other 
end.
She states that big companies 
like Meta will need to work with 
other technology companies 
like Epic Games or Square Enix 
to create their platforms and services in a seamless way across 
the metaverse. But there isn‚Äôt 
much hope as the tech companies 
‚Äúare more willing to consolidate 
than cooperate.‚Äù
In a jarring YouTube video by 
Meta from October last year, the 
almost hour-and-thirty-minute 
video features Facebook creator 
and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 
amidst different, bizarre 
backdrops in cartoon form and 
as himself. Zuckerberg ‚Äî who 
renamed Facebook to Meta a 
few months ago as a symbol 
of the belief in progressing 
the metaverse ‚Äî expressed 
his enthusiasm in embracing a 
world where one can take on 
new identities and roles in richer 
ways than reality permits.
He believes the metaverse 
is the successor to the mobile 
internet. He assures the audience 
that this belief isn‚Äôt about 
spending more time on 
screens but rather making the 
time we already spend better 
and enhanced. 
Though articulate and 
approachable, Zuckerberg 
seems deliberately focused on 
assuaging fears and concerns 
with fun and vibrant scenes 
of community ‚Äî something 
that the very stiff, unnatural 
dialogue of his collaborators 
in most scenes don‚Äôt help 
with.
The realms of NFTs and 
the metaverse offer a surreal 
arena to individuals, one in 
which people can express 
themselves how they would 
like. The metaverse intends 
to be so immersive that one 
can feel the closeness of 
individuals next to them ‚Äî 
something that would offer 
convenience and community. 
Many individuals expressed 
their discomfort in comment 
sections of videos or social 
media with the idea that a virtual 
reality will coincide with reality. 
It is a kind of fear comparable 
to the uncanny valley of seeing 
figures that oftentimes look like 
us ‚Äî behave. 
Zuckerberg re-emphasized 
safety and security as the biggest 
priority, but with a world that 
is set to be almost tangible and 
utterly realistic, would one be 
able to discern between realities, 
particularly if the realm becomes 
more attractive than the ‚Äúreal‚Äù 
reality? 
This new mode of living is far 
from here, but it is developing. 
If monetization of everything 
from images to ads exists, big 
corporations may take the lead 
in what we see, based on what 
they think we‚Äôd like to see. 
When the metaverse arises, the 
topic of privacy and security will 
be ceaseless. 
Though it might be 
disingenuous to flip prices or 
resell an NFT, does it matter 
as long as the market is still 
lucrative and incredibly 
supportive for the artists? After 
all, though the desire with the 
metaverse is to implement better 
for people, profit will always be 
at the other end of the line.The NFTs Are the New Meta(verse)
/T_he rise of cryptocurrency also saw the rise of NFTs, a new way to digitally ‚Äúown‚Äù 
something. /T_he new wave of technology is coming along with the metaverse, what are the 
rami/f_ications of going all digital?

You‚Äôre probably thinking, 
‚ÄúGreat, another article about 
how amazing and glorious New 
York City is and why ever yone 
should live there.‚Äù And honestly, 
as I am writing this, I‚Äôm thinking 
the same way. I wanted to share 
the experience I had in New 
York over the winter break, but 
also wanted to make sure that 
whatever I shared wouldn‚Äôt get 
lost in the mud of the pro-NYC 
rhetoric decorated around the 
internet. So I picked my brain. 
What did I like most about 
New York? I saw some amazing 
pieces of art, architecture and 
performance. I walked the busy 
streets and hailed a taxi. I had 
a classic NYC pizza slice on the 
side of the street next to pigeons. 
But when I really thought about 
it, it was the people I met in 
passing throughout the entirety 
of the trip that really made it 
memorable. Every single ticket 
vendor, shopkeep, waiter, museum attendant, and stranger 
was so incredibly kind. Never 
have I been to such a kind and 
welcoming place. A place where 
yes, people mind their business 
and the tourists are annoying, 
but a place where even strangers 
are kind enough to pay you 
compliments on your clothes, 
hair, or just you in general.
Just like any place in the 
world, the people are what give 
the city its personality. Without 
people, cities would just be cold 
metal jungles with very little 
intrigue or personality. For some 
reason though, I thought New 
York City would be the exception. 
With the thousands of pictures 
I‚Äôve seen, songs I‚Äôve listened to 
and movies and TV shows that 
have been made about this city, 
I half-expected the sidewalk to 
be bursting with life. But when 
I got there, the sidewalks were 
normal, the building tall and 
cold, and the streets filled with 
cars. 
What was magical were the 
people. I know I‚Äôm driving this point into the ground, but truly if 
I could bring back anything from 
New York it would have been the 
people. I have no idea how I could 
fit them in my suitcase, and I‚Äôm 
sure half of them would hate 
San Diego. It‚Äôs just hard saying 
goodbye to everyone, especially 
to the woman who got engaged 
while ice skating at Rockefeller 
Center‚Ä¶ that was magical.
That is the joy of travelling. 
New places, new food, and 
new people. When done right, 
traveling can invigorate your 
own life; energize your spirit. 
By no means is this the same 
call to travelling that rich white 
instagram influencers preach on 
a daily basis. Instead, it is an 
encouragement to go someplace 
new. I know for a fact I haven‚Äôt 
been to downtown San Diego in 
awhile. Getting out and seeing 
the world and meeting the people 
that make the world what it is is 
priceless. So, go out there and 
meet someone new. Pay them a 
compliment while you‚Äôre at it.Written BY Bradley Beggs

UC San Diego‚Äôs men‚Äôs 
volleyball team played their first 
match of the 2022 season on 
Jan. 14, defeating the Harvard 
University Crimson 3 sets to 1, 
16‚Äì25, 25‚Äì16, 25‚Äì20, and 25‚Äì23. 
Star senior outside hitter Kyle 
McCauley had a match-high 17 
kills, and redshirt junior outside 
hitter Ryan Ka had two straight 
aces to win the match, as the 
No. 10 Tritons (1‚Äì0) started 
strong against their unranked 
Ivy League foe.
The Tritons entered their 
match against Harvard at 
RIMAC Arena after having their previous weekend of matches 
at the UC Santa Barbara Asics 
Invitational cancelled; the 
tournament would have pitted 
the Tritons against teams like 
No. 12 University of Southern 
California, No. 2 UCLA, and 
No. 11 UCSB.
It was a back-and-forth start 
for the Tritons in their first 
set of the season, as they took 
advantage of Harvard errors to 
go up 5‚Äì2 before three straight 
UCSD errors knotted the match 
back up at 5. The set remained 
tight, as senior middle blocker 
Logan Clark slotted home two 
consecutive kills off of assists 
from senior setter Blake Crisp 
to make it 12‚Äì12 midset. But 
soon after, the Crimson took 
over the set with a massive 9‚Äì1 run, interrupted only by a right-
handed kill by Ka out of a UCSD 
timeout, that put Harvard in a 
22‚Äì14 lead. The Tritons couldn‚Äôt 
do much to win the set from 
there, as an attack error from 
Clark closed out the set in the 
Crimson‚Äôs favor, 25‚Äì16.
The second set again started 
out evenly matched, with 
the points neatly alternating 
between sides with the exception 
of two Harvard service errors, 
as it was 8‚Äì6 Tritons early on. 
But sparked by a powerful kill 
by McCauley on the left side of 
the net that bounced out off of 
the Crimson block, the Tritons 
ran up a 7‚Äì2 run to go up 15‚Äì8, 
with the final point coming on 
another McCauley kill after his 
own off-speed serve. That put 
UCSD in the driver‚Äôs seat for 
the remainder of the set, and 
while Harvard closed the lead 
to 22‚Äì16 with 4 consecutive 
points, the Tritons shut the 
door with 3 straight points; 
the Crimson couldn‚Äôt contain a 
McCauley strike, his ninth kill 
of the match, as it landed for set 
point, 25‚Äì16.
The Tritons took a quick 
lead on another important 
run in the third set, as a Ka 
kill started a 4‚Äì0 run that put 
UCSD up 7‚Äì3 in the early going 
of the set. Later in the set, with 
the Tritons still maintaining 
a lead, a disciplined block by 
Clark, Ka, and senior outside 
hitter Charlie Siragusa made it 
3 points in a row for the home 
side and extended the lead to 
14‚Äì9. While both teams battled 
for momentum to take an all-
important 2‚Äì1 set lead, the 
Crimson never got closer than 
3 points away, and McCauley came up clutch again with a 
block to put the set away for 
UCSD, 25‚Äì20.
UCSD was up early once 
again in the fourth set, starting 
off the frame with an 8‚Äì4 lead. 
But the Crimson, looking to tie 
up the match 2-all, knotted the 
set at 10‚Äì10, and again at 14‚Äì14. 
After a Harvard attack error 
put the Tritons up 15‚Äì14, the 
Crimson scored four straight, 
including three straight UCSD 
attack errors landing out of 
bounds, as they took a 18‚Äì15 
advantage. Later in the set, the 
Crimson were still up 3, 22‚Äì19, 
and were on the inside track 
to tie up the proceedings. But 
McCauley got way up to direct 
a ball that fell perfectly inside 
the Crimson baseline for the 
kill, and the Crimson hit the 
antenna at the net‚Äôs edge on 
the next possession for a UCSD 
point, bringing the Triton 
deficit to just 22‚Äì21.
Coming out of the ensuing 
timeout, the Crimson made 
a nice crosscourt kill to go 
up 23‚Äì21 and regain some 
momentum, and once again 
had control of the set and their 
eye on a fifth-set decider. But 
McCauley cut the lead to 1 
with a kill to center court, then 
Siragusa‚Äôs ball on the next point 
ricocheted off the Harvard 
defense into the stands, and 
just like that, the set was tied 
at 23; UCSD had regained 
the momentum, forcing the 
Crimson to take a timeout to 
regroup. Ka was up to serve 
on the next play, and his ball 
was mishandled by Harvard 
into the net, giving Ka an ace 
and giving the Tritons a match 
point. Ka once again dialed in an excellent, pacey serve to the 
back left of Harvard‚Äôs court 
that was impossible to return, 
hitting the ground before the 
Crimson could get under it, 
for a second straight ace and 
the match winner, with the set 
ending 25‚Äì23.
McCauley, a 2020 All-
American and 2021 All-Big 
West player who started for 
the U.S. at the Pan American 
Cup last year, led the Triton 
squad with 17 kills, followed by 
Clark and Ka with 11 apiece. 
Clark also led the team with 
6 blocks, while senior middle 
blocker Shane Benetz and Ka 
each had 4; Ka also led UCSD 
with 11 digs, while the setter 
Crisp had a nice game with 44 
assists. After a negative hitting 
percentage in the first set, the 
Tritons outhit the Crimson in 
each of the next three sets to get 
the win.
‚ÄúWe lost the first set, we 
didn‚Äôt play our best brand of 
volleyball. [There were] some 
jitters, you got to figure some 
things out when you go out 
there,‚Äù said 17-year head coach 
Kevin Ring. ‚ÄúI thought we were 
passing well on the night and 
had some stretches of great 
serving, so it was great to get 
the victory tonight.‚Äù
After their opening win and 
their second match, a 3‚Äì0 sweep 
of No. 12 Stanford University on 
Jan. 15, Ring‚Äôs Tritons next take 
on Grand Canyon University 
on Jan. 21, before a New Jersey 
road trip to take on the New 
Jersey Institute of Technology 
and Princeton University on 
Jan. 28 and 29, respectively.Triton Volleyball Opens 
2022 Season with 
Defeat of  Harvard
The UC San Diego women‚Äôs 
basketball team (6‚Äì7, 3‚Äì1 Big 
West) took on the University 
of Hawaii (4‚Äì7, 1‚Äì1 Big West) 
attempting to get their third 
conference win of the season. 
After two close victories to 
start off the conference slate, 
the team lost to UC Irvine, but 
they came back with a purpose 
in this game. Using a big third 
quarter run, the Tritons put on 
one of their most impressive 
offensive performances again in 
front of an empty arena due to 
COVID regulations. The team 
was great from three-point 
land, shooting 43% and only 
committing nine turnovers. In 
coach Heidi VanDerveer‚Äôs tenth 
season at UCSD, she reached 
a historic 200th win with an 
impressive, clean performance 
in the Tritons‚Äô 82‚Äì58 rout of 
Hawaii.
In the first quarter, UCSD 
started their offensive barrage 
quickly with a layup from senior 
guard Emily Cangelosi assisted 
by senior forward Sydney 
Brown. Soon after a fastbreak off 
a Brown rebound was converted 
into a nice jumpshot by senior 
guard Madison Baxter, taking 
a three point lead early with 
the score standing at 6‚Äì3. After 
exchanging some baskets, the 
Tritons extended their lead with 
consecutive layups by Brown 
to inflate the lead to five. The 
score at the end of the first 
quarter was 16‚Äì11, with neither 
team yet showing too much offensive firepower. The Tritons 
came out with solid play and a 
characteristically stout defense 
and would look to continue that 
in the second.
To start the second, Brown 
continued her offensive attack 
with another three pointer and 
layup. Putting the Tritons up 
eight at 19‚Äì11, Brown personally 
put up ten straight for UCSD 
and was an unstoppable one-
woman show early on. The run 
continued with a steal and three 
pointer by Cangelosi, and the 
Tritons were doubling up on 
their opponents early, now at 
26‚Äì13.
Basketball still is a game of 
runs though, and the lead was 
quickly shrunk. Hawaii went 
on a quick 11‚Äì2 run in two 
minutes of play to shrink the 
lead to four, converting off of 
turnovers and bad shot selection 
from the Tritons. A well-timed 
timeout gave UCSD a needed 
reset, and Cangelosi scored 
a three out of the break. The 
Tritons committed some fouls 
as the half expired, but a mostly 
clean first half culminated in a 
35‚Äì28 lead going into the break, 
though much of the momentum 
was lost after the big Hawaii 
run.
Brown again opened the 
scoring for the Tritons with a 
three off the break opened up 
by a rebound from senior guard 
Julia Macabuhay, which Brown 
followed up with another three 
from Brown. After the Hawaii 
Rainbow Warriors cut the lead 
down to five, UCSD responded 
with an incredible 15‚Äì0 run 
to break open this game. The 
run started with jumpers from sophomore forward Aishah 
Brown and Baxter. UCSD 
forced multiple turnovers 
from Hawaii and played great 
defense along the run, which 
was punctuated by two Baxter 
free throws to put the lead at 20 
with a 56‚Äì36 advantage in tow. 
While not insurmountable, the 
Tritons looked like they had a 
route under way at this point in 
the game after the consecutive 
pivotal scores. With the last 
possession of the quarter, Baxter 
splashed in a three assisted by 
Cangelosi to put the Tritons up 
18 at the end of the third.
The momentum continued 
quickly in the decisive fourth 
quarter, with Baxter hitting 
another three to give the 
Tritons their largest lead of the matchup, with the score now at 
64‚Äì43. While Hawaii had some 
fight left, a three by Cangelosi 
with six and a half minutes to 
go put any hope to rest for the 
opposition. UCSD continued to 
rain in the threes as they had 
done all the game, and a five 
player substitution around the 
two minute mark signaled this 
one was just about over.
UCSD played a complete 
game against Hawaii, playing 
consistent defense and 
scoring well from the outside. 
Performances from Alyssa 
Brown, Baxter and Cangelosi 
propelled the Tritons to a very 
impressive third conference 
victory. The experienced and 
well-coached squad are now 
tied for the Big West lead as conference play moves along, 
and this particular stellar 
showing is made even sweeter 
with coach VanDerveer‚Äôs 200th 
win for the Tritons.
‚ÄúIt means I‚Äôve coached 
a lot of great players and I 
work with a great staff,‚Äù said 
coach VanDerveer of what the 
milestone meant to her. ‚ÄúWe 
know how to win, we work 
hard to win, and we don‚Äôt take 
winning for granted.‚Äù 
The next game for this 
up-and-coming team will come 
at California State University, 
Long Beach next Thursday, Jan. 
20th, where the Tritons will 
look to capture another victory 
against a conference opponent.By Donovan Perez-Schipper
