COUNCIL HAVE CLOSED THE GROVE CAFE?THE ENDBy Regina Ip
Associate News Editor
A week after A.S. Council first 
met to appoint the 2010-11 associ-
ate vice presidents, one of the three remaining positions is still unfilled — leaving the council to enter next year without a full cabinet of 10 AVPs in charge of managing various aspects of student life. 
On May 26, the council voted 
against appointing A.S. President Wafa Ben Hassine’s nominations for three AVP positions. The nominations of former Campuswide Senator Desiree Prevo for the AVP of Academic Affairs position, and former AVP of Local Affairs Aries Yumul for the AVP of College Affairs position were voted down, while the nomination of Eleanor Roosevelt College sophomore Arohi Sharma for the AVP of Student Advocacy position was tabled. 
On June 3, the council approved 
Prevo and Sharma to temporarily fill the Academic Affairs and Student Advocacy positions, respectively. They will carry out the AVP posi-tions until Week Four of Fall Quarter at which point applications for the position will reopen. 
The position of AVP of College 
Affairs was not discussed and will not be filled until Fall Quarter. 
According to Ben Hassine, all 
three positions were tabled at the Campus Affairs committee meeting, which is held prior to the council meeting. From that, the Academic Affairs and Student Advocacy posi-tions were pulled out of committee to be discussed at the meeting. 
Ben Hassine said the positions 
were tabled — and then voted down —  because councilmembers dis-agreed with the process of choosing members for the selection commit-tee. The selection committee consists of the president, the outgoing AVP and three to four council senators.
See AVP,page 7In less than two hours last night, the A.S. Council voted 17-2 to shut down the Grove Cafe, effectively ending a 24-year saga that included numerous attempts to revitalize the struggling eatery. 
The decision comes a year after the previous council voted last June 
to continue operating the coffee shop, which was $140,000 in debt at the time. However, despite ongoing renovations and a much-hyped reopening this Winter Quarter, the business has increased its debt over $35,000, to a total of nearly $180,000. 
According to both Vice President of Finance and Resources 
Andrew Ang and Associate Vice President of Enterprise Operations Brian McEuen, the Grove would need to make a daily profit of $925 to cover its operating costs alone. However, since reopening in January, By Connie Qian
Senior Staff Writer
Over 11,000 nurses from five 
UC medical centers — including the UCSD medical centers — will strike on June 10 to protest unsafe nurse-to-patient ratios, the National Nurses United announced last Friday.
“One of the things we’ve been ask-
ing is that the [nurse-to-patient] ratio should be maintained at all times, ” UCSD Medical Center - Hillcrest reg-istered nurse Janice Webb said. “We’re asking for break-relief nurses. That’s a nurse that comes in and watches your patient while you’re on break. ”
The protest, slated to be the largest 
nurse strike in U.S. history, will also include an additional 14,000 nurs-es from California and Minnesota, totaling 25,000 participants.
California law requires hospitals 
to maintain at least one nurse for every three to five patients, depend-ing on the care the patients receive. The union said it wants to mandate stronger enforcement of these laws and establish safe ratios at all times. 
According to Webb, the medical 
centers do not have enough nurses to attend the patients.
 “We’ve been having meetings 
with hospitals that say they already have charge nurses, but realistical-ly they can’t maintain the ratio on breaks, ” she said. “ A lot of times when the charge nurses [or nurses who supervise] watch, there are still more nurses needed — just someone to help out. ”
However, in an online statement, 
the UC Office of the President con-tended that such a strike is without legitimate cause.
“The university considers this 
action unlawful, a violation of good-faith bargaining requirements and a clear violation of the parties’ con-tract, ” UCOP said in their statement.
The strike will also attempt to 
secure the nurses’ retirement benefits to make sure neither politicians nor the health industry can easily rescind them.
“The other thing we’re concerned 
about is the pension and our health benefits, ” Webb said. “Things are get-ting expensive now, and they’re trying to look at ways to cut costs. That’s going to affect people, and we want After 24 years on campus, the ailing Grove Cafe 
will close its doors for good. By Ayelet Bitton

and the chairs  aroun d me 
creaked with the late arrival  
of councilmembers, my first foray  in 
the world of A.S. Coun cil officially 
began. 
The meetin g began with an 
emotional  publi c input perio d. The 
incoming Movimiento  Estudiantil  
Chicano de Aztlan  Chair , Mar 
Velez , urged the council to side 
with MECh A 
and take a stand 
against  the con-
troversial  Arizona 
immi gration  
bill by passin g a 
resolution  that 
condemns the 
Arizona legislature.
Following la
st week’s associate 
vice presid ent appoint ment d rama 
— w here  the council table d or voted 
down every  candidate fledgling 
A.S. Presid ent Wafa Ben Hassine  
nominate d for AVP positions — for-
mer AVP of  Colle ge Affairs  James 
Lintern  offere d his advice as to the 
most resp
onsible  way to decide on 
AVP c andidates.  
The resolution  on the Arizona 
bill returne d to the forefront  of 
council, with repeate d objections  
voiced by former AVP Ac ademic 
Affairs  Jordan Taylor  regarding the 
wording of the res
olution  and its rel-
evan ce to UCSD students.  
Campuswide Senator  Victor 
Flores c ountere d Taylor ’s argu-
ments and said the resolution  was 
pertinent to all students. H e pointe d 
out that any student at UCSD w ho 
would visit Arizona — G rand 
Ca
nyon  roadtrip, anyone ? — coul d 
be stoppe d by police if any suspi cion 
over  his or her legal status  arose.  
After a lengthy discussion, the coun-
cil ultimately  passed the resolution  
condemning the bill.Finally , the familiar debate  over  
the Grove  Cafe  aro
se for the last 
time in its tumultuous , 24-year his-
tory.  In a move parallel  to last year’s 
similar debate , members spent  about  
an hour  debatin g the relative  merits  
of the eatery  and whether it was the 
council’s responsibility  to keep the 
space ope
n despite  its thrice-faile d 
business  plan  and growing debt.  
AVP of Enterprise  Operations  
Brian McEuen  
and Vice 
Presid ent of 
Finan ce and 
Resour ces 
Andrew Ang — 
who jointly  spon-
sored the legis-
lation  to close the Grove  —  both  
argued that the Grove  would not 
cove
r from its nearly  $180,000 debt  
and that closin g the business  would 
cut the council’s losses.   
The council only  paused for a 
brief respite  in their d iscussion of 
the Grove  to charge a committee  
to find other  business  options  to 
repla ce the area.   
Ultimat
ely, in a decision opposite  
that from last year, coun cilmembers 
decided that keepin g the Grove  was 
not fiscally responsible  and voted 
17-2 to close the business  by June 30. 
Coun cil then  moved on to 
New Business , where  it passed a 
res
olution  in support  of the Iranian  
Non-Violent Student M ovement for 
Democratic Reform, w hich affirmed 
the council’s support  of the Iranian  
Green  Movement fighting for human 
rights. 
As I pa cked my bags, I m ade a 
mental
 note  to bring snacks to the 
next meetin g — espe cially when 
food enterprises are up for discus-
sion.

the ability  to negotiate  with them 
when they  decide. ”
According to Webb , the California 
Nurses A ssociation  recently present-
ed UC m edical centers  with a resolu-
tion to the proble m before  resortin g 
to a state- wide strike.
“We didn’t come up with a cook-
ie-cutte
r program, ” Webb  said. “We 
made a recommendation  base d on 
each unit, w hat type  of patients  
they  have.  We actually  had a well 
thou ght out plan , and we’d  like to 
give it a try and enter  a contra ct 
so that way we’d  actually  be able to 
enfor ce the plan. ”
Webb  said that the UC m edical 
centers  would benefit  if more nurses  
were brou ght in to care for patients.
“There  are all these issues they ’re 
havin g at all hospitals  in Ca lifornia, 
such as patients  fallin g, ” Webb  said. 
“Break nurses  can help  out with that 
kind of stuff  — the  little things that 
kind of fall throu gh the cracks when 
people  are on brea ks.”
She added that improvin g the 
nurs
e-to-patient ratio is a necessity  
in order to maintain  quality  care in 
the medical centers.
“People  deserve m ore time to take 
a deep breath ,”  Webb  said. “You can’t 
really  work that well if you’re not going 
to have  enou gh time to gather  your  
tho
ughts, espe cially in this difficult 
field of work. You need it to give the 
patients  the good c are they deserve. ”
UCSD H ealth  Syste m spokesper-
son Kimberly  Edw ards claims the 
medical centers  do not know w hat 
actions  they  will take in re sponse  to 
the strike.
“It’s too early  in the process for 
speculation, finan cial or other wise,”  
she said.

the business has only made an aver-
age of $525 each day.
“I would say that the whole pro-
cess and attempt to revitalize the Grove failed, ” Ang said. “It was a good effort, and there were plans, but at the moment there is definitely nothing else we can do. It’s too much in debt for us to really do anything right now. ”
McEuen said the cafe was closed 
because its high debt and competi-tion decreased the likelihood that it would bring in the necessary profits to operate sustainably. 
“We are subsidizing the Grove, ” 
McEuen said. “To cover the debt, we would need to make over $2,000 a day to cover our debt next year. With all the coffee and sandwich businesses on this campus, that’s not going to happen. ”
The legislation to shut down the 
Grove — which was sponsored by McEuen — called for the eatery to officially close on June 30. In order to close the venue, the council must pay the unresolved debt with money from its reserve funding and other enterprise income. The council has yet to develop an official debt repay-ment plan, but will no longer need to account for extra Grove expenses in its official 2010-11 budget. 
A few councilmembers were con-
cerned that the council’s quick deci-sion neglects the Grove’s long his-tory. Former A.S. President Utsav Gupta released a statement on the A.S. listserv two hours following the decision, condemning the council’s actions.
“The Grove has been a campus 
establishment for over two decades, ” Gupta said in the statement. “The council moved to eliminate it in a little over 24 hours. There was no public input offered through public forums, I doubt anyone who worked at the Grove was notified, and there was no committee process to review the fiscal performance of the Grove. ”
The decision to shut down the 
Grove came on the heels of the coun-cil’s repeated efforts to make the business profitable. This year, for-mer VP of Finance and Resources Peter Benesch and former AVP of Enterprise Operations Rishi Ghosh began plans to make over the cafe with renovations to the facilities, new equipment for the kitchen area and a reopening event — costing approxi-mately $6,000 —  that offered free food for four days.  
“There’s some basic 
simple things that could be changed about the business model that could make the Grove a profit-able, if not at least self-sustaining business ven-ture, ” Benesch said. “For that reason, I argued for keeping the Grove open this past year. Myself and Rishi [Ghosh] put in an incalculable amount of time to revitalize the Grove, but the enterprise is still failing and there’s really no help for it. ”
Ghosh said that, 
despite all the efforts, the Grove still experienced a significant decrease in sales that he believes can only be attributed to embezzlement or poor customer service.
“I cannot think of any rational 
explanation of this apart from some-one skimming money off the top of the accounts to the point where they’re taking out a large percent of the money, ” Ghosh said. “It’s also like-ly that people weren’t coming back due to poor customer service. ”
Benesch and Ghosh agreed that 
Grove’s current student-run business model was another major factor in the Grove’s failure.
“The Grove kind of operates on 
the co-op model, ” Benesch said. “The employees feel a lot of ownership over the space, and that’s fantastic. I would have no problem with that if it was a self-sustaining venture, but it’s not. It’s a liability for the Associated Students. ”
Ghosh added that the sense of 
proprietorship the student manag-ers feel may have compromised their ability to operate the Grove as a busi-ness.
“I would say that there’s definitely 
a reluctance from the student work-ers to think critically about the issues 
[facing the Grove] and to actually reform them-selves, ” Ghosh said. “I think they were much happier without any sort of accountability to themselves or the general student body. ”
The Grove’s lack of 
prominence on cam-pus is represented by a survey councilmem-bers conducted Winter Quarter, after the reopening. Of the 1,600 students who partici-pated, 42 percent said they do not go the Grove and 24 percent said they do not know about the 
Grove.
Ang and McEuen used these sta-
tistics, combined with the Grove’s decreasing sale numbers, to urge councilmembers to vote to close the cafe.
“I know a lot of people will be 
voting on what was, but please sepa-rate from what was and look to the future, ” Ang said. “It’s been failing and it’s going to keep failing. Do we want the debt to grow to $200,000, $250,000 or over $300,000? Look at it from a financial point of view. ”
Only two council members voted 
not to close the Grove, saying that they hoped instead to hold off hand-ing over the space to University 
Centers and replace the cafe with a new business venture.
“Our A.S. Council has the poten-
tial to grow so much, ” President Wafa Ben Hassine said. “We are a new council and we have yet to see our potential. At least for the time being, I think we should hold off on handing over the space. ”
However, the Grove’s contract 
states that its space agreement is con-tingent upon it offering “limited food service. ” Thus, if the council were to replace the Grove with a different business, the contract would be termi-nated regardless.
Upon the Grove’s official June 30 
closure, the space will be returned to University Centers. As a part of the vote to close the Grove, the coun-cil created a committee — proposed by Campuswide Senator Elizabeth Elman — to discuss potential alter-native business ventures that could replace the Grove’s in its current location. However, such propos-als would require approval by the University Centers Advisory Board and University Centers administra-tors — a lengthy process that requires significant market research.
The committee to explore alter-
native enterprises for the Grove will consist of three council members, and will report its findings within the first two weeks of Fall Quarter 2010.
Councilmembers who supported 
closing the Grove said they hope to instead focus efforts on the A.S. store, which will be opening next year.
“ As an A.S. and as a business-own-
ing entity, it’s fiscally irresponsible for us to keep the Grove, ” Ang said. “We’ll also be opening the A.S. store next year, so we also have to divert our resources there, to an enterprise that will most likely be successful and one that will not have the financial downfall that the Grove has right now. ”

“There was little bit of miscom-
munication that was cleared up with a few individuals, ” Ben Hassine said. “ A couple of the senators may have felt that the selection process was biased or unfair. ”
According to current AVP of 
Student Advocacy Chris Cruz, coun-cilmembers claimed that Ben Hassine formed the selection committees in a biased manner. They claimed that Ben Hassine never replied to e-mails requesting to serve on the selection committees, which lead to a loaded committee. Ben Hassine claimed the miscommunication was due to the lack of staff, who would have otherwise responded to the requests.
She declined to state the names of 
the aforementioned councilmembers since the meeting was closed-session, which means councilmembers cannot disclose specifics to the public. 
“None of us had staff and [the 
e-mails were sent] during the transition period, ” Ben Hassine said. “That’s why a lot of the e-mails weren’t responded to but, traditionally, that doesn’t really happen. ”
Ben Hassine added that disagree-
ments arose over the nominees’ quali-fications for the position.
“Many senators felt that a closer 
evaluation of AVPs’ qualifications was necessary before they’re appointed their respective positions, ” Ben Hassine said. 
For example, Sharma said council-
members preferred another candidate for the Student Advocacy position.
The council will reevaluate AVP 
applicants when the application peri-od reopens during Week Four of Fall Quarter.

Even if you’re not a

probably heard of “Eat,

Times  bestseller that docu-
ments a woman’s yearlong trip abroad, spent traipsing in three countries and 
escaping a midlife crisis. Naturally, Hollywood recognized the novel’s matronly following for its cash-cow  potential. Starring the talented — yet, far too beautiful 
for the role — Julia Roberts, the film promises to be this summer’s token chick flick. But before you dismiss it as 2010’s “Mamma Mia!” consider two things: Robert Richardson, the visionary behind “Inglourious Basterds, ” “The Aviator” and “Kill Bill” is director of photography, and Javier Bardem … ’nuff said.

Alot has happened in Xtina’s life since her last release, 2006’s Back 
to Basics . She’s settled down with 
her manager, popped out a kid and become an actress.
But despite any signs of maturation, 
Aguilera’s latest is an overproduced ode to clubbing, boozing and boys — sprin-kled with a few out-of-place moments of moth-erly reflection in a return to her “Dirrty” roots. 
On slow jam “Sex for Breakfast, ” Aguilera 
croons she “wants you deep inside of me, ” fol-lowed up by a 20-second interlude of her two-year-old son imitating mom’s trademark belt-ing. (Good thing the kid’s too young to under-stand any noises from the parents’ room.)
Other, less-than-subtle low points include 
a botched attempt at flaunting girl power on adolescent anthem “I Hate Boys, ” on which Aguilera spouts banana innuendos to a too-common drumming beat.
In fact, even Bionic ’s shining moments 
(“Elastic Love, ” “Bionic”) sound a little too familiar, and for good reason: Aguilera co-
wrote “Bionic” with M.I.A. and collaborated with Santigold producer Switch on the latter to churn out a pair of thumping imitations — which almost make up for a complete lack of originality with sheer danceability. 
There is, however, one consistent selling 
point in Aguilera’s jumbled treatise on mother-hood and getting laid. Xtina’s booming vocal range is on full display throughout, including on flopped first single “Not Myself Tonight. ” By final cut “Vanity, ” though, even those pipes can’t save Aguilera from the revelation that this self-proclaimed bad bitch is past her prime.

This sounds like it was ripped off a pseudo-punk pin from Hot Topic, but I have to admit: music is my 
life. Deny it all you want, but it’s all of ours, really. The melancholy strums of Nick Drake are the soundtrack to grueling all-nighters; “Telephone” fuels 
weekend Four Loko binges; Dookie  
recalls that middle school punk stage 
which took too long to grow out. 
It provides the soundtrack to nearly 
every moment of our lives. Personally, I’ve spent hours crafting the perfect mix for important moments of my life. 
For my senior prom, I made the 
ultimate ‘80s playlist, just so I could drive around in a limo through San Francisco to the Talking Heads. As a freshman, I burned the new songs I scavenged from Limewire onto CDs for my friends. They called me “the Mix Master, ” and it gave me a big fuck-ing ego. 
These days I still make endless 
mixes for whatever scenario I might find myself in: the hazy trip to Las Vegas, the long, summer nights I spend talking to my best friend in the street, the windy drive through the back roads of my hometown. There’s the perfect song for every moment and it is my mission to find it. (Just so you know, for the aforementioned events I’ d pick “Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell” by Das Racist, “Range Life” by Pavement and “Ocean Breathes Salty” by Modest Mouse, respectively.)
When music can define an entire 
portion of your life, it’s even better, as my fellow editors and I proved last weekend. Delving through the depths of my iPod, we uncovered the perfect driving songs for our perilous trek to the Anza-Borrego desert. Vintage fare was the fitting request, so my classic rock collection banged against the looming mountains as we blasted Bowie and gleefully belted “Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes!” 
It didn’t stop there. After Ranger 
Sue shut down our impromptu rager — which consisted of blasting raunchy hip-hop long past quiet hours — we switched to beatboxing. (Nothing will ever top our campfire remix of “The Lion Sleeps Tonight. ”) And when we discovered a giant portable speaker in a latecomer’s car, it was like finding an oasis in the barren landscape, spark-ing an early morning dance party and a Beatles-fueled siesta when the heat proved too powerful.
As the music nerd that I am under-
paid to be, the moments I associate with a song are clearly significant. While a good conversation and the desert scenery flashing by as I drive 
are just as important in memory, 
music plays a vital role too. On top of the amazing hikes and completely belligerent nights, last weekend will always play back in my head to Shakira’s “Time for Africa (Waka Waka). ” 
And I’m not the only one who 
orchestrates her life soundtrack. There are others out there who swoon at 
the thought of blasting “Bittersweet 
Symphony” on the open road, and there are certainly others who worry over the perfect playlist like I do. So own up to your obsession, geeks: I gave up on my pride years ago. My Life Is

Escher world of optical illusions. City roads fold up like origami; buildings  collapse; Joseph Gordon-
Levitt charges down a pinwheeling corridor, defy-ing gravity. 
At the forefront of a new form of corporate espionage, Dom Cobb (DiCaprio) sneaks into his victims’ dreams, stealing coveted ideas and inven-tions that could “transform the world and rewrite all the rules. ” To save himself from the loveless life of a fugitive, he takes on one last job. This time, instead of filching, he must cause an “inception” — planting an idea in someone’s head. With such a confusing plot, it’s clear that Nolan won’t be giving us any helpful hints.
Between its cryptic title, stealth marketing 
(the first trailer was void of dialogue) and top-secret script (the actors could only read it in Nolan’s office), “Inception” will be way overdue come its arrival on July 16.

Senior Staff Writer  INCEPTION TOY STORY 3
Fifteen long years after its inception, Pixar/Disney is finally releasing the third installment of the “Toy Story” 
franchise on June 18. The pressure of liv-ing up to the recognizable film series is a crushing one —but the tested brilliance of screenwriter Michael Arndt (“Little Miss Sunshine”) promises a film worthy of the “Toy Story” name. 
Since many of the trilogy’s original 
followers are now clambering into dilapi-dated cars headed off to college, the film sets its sights on higher education. “Toy Story 3” follows its audience’s growth as Woody’s longtime owner Andy sets off for university. A mix-up leads Andy’s mother to believe that the toys — except Woody — are garbage. Woody’s attempt to rescue his fellow playthings lands them in a daycare. Fed up with the sticky-fingered rampage that ensues, the gang devises a plan to escape the plastic-plush prison and reunite with Andy. 
Though the overarching separation 
anxiety is fairly typical of a “Toy Story” film, the nuanced nostalgia it inspires in its aging audience will be sure to inspire Rex-sized tears from parents and graduating seniors alike. With animation that shines brighter than that of its 1995 predeces-sor, “Toy Story 3” is bound to be another adventurous romp through Toyland, and hopefully will prove to be as lovable as the first two.

EAT, PRAY, LOVEOne thing M.I.A. knows is that controversy sells. To prepare for her third album, Maya , the 
superstar released a gruesome music video — an 8:56 minute slaughter-
fest of gingers — to accompany 
“Born Free. ” A political statement, 
maybe, but so graphic it was banned 
from Y ouTube. Stirring up even more uproar, after a New York Times  report-
er wrote an unflattering feature that 
claimed her political shtick was unau-
thentic, M.I.A. turned to her Twitter to 
defend herself, saying, “I’ll [be] taking 
calls all day bitches, ” which was followed 
by the writer’s phone number — ouch. 
M.I.A. has described this newest 
album as “schizophrenic, ” which aptly 
describes “Born Free” and “XXXO” — 
tracks dominated by chaotic beats that 
underpin M.I.A. ’s breezy style. “Born 
Free, ” in particular, has M.I.A. going in 
a decidedly punk direction, layering her 
rhymes with an unrelenting bass line. If 
she continues the controversy, come July 
13, people will definitely be talking about 
M.I.A. — whether the album actually deliv-
ers or not.

STARRING ADRIAN BRODY, SARAH POLLEY 
DIRECTED BY VINCENZO NATALI
RATED R1:04SPLICE
In an interview with The 
Guardian , director Vincenzo 
Natali calls his sci-fi horror flick 
“Splice” “an exploration of inner 
space instead of outer space … it’s emotional horror. ”
Unfortunately, that emotion 
leaves the audience wondering just where this inner-space exploration was supposed to be headed.  
The film follows scientist couple 
Clive (Adrien Brody) and Elsa (Sarah Polley) as they experiment with creating hybrid animals for medical purposes. The couple cre-ates Dren (Delphine Chané ac), 
beginning a Frankenstein-esque tale as Dren rapidly grows from a small kangaroo/rat into a sentient almost-human with a stinger tail.Natali is best known for the 1997 
psychological thriller “Cube, ” and “Splice” has moments of disturb-ing insight that would put Freud to shame. But other than those scant instances, the characters are flat, bouncing between dull extremes of tenderness and psychosis. Elsa is the typical smothering mother, while Clive is the responsible scientist who spouts off about how they crossed a line creating Dren in the first place. It’s no better when they switch soapboxes halfway through the film; they’re just flat in different ways. 
The script’s tentative explorations 
of ethical questions  — like why Elsa would create and raise Dren — show that it’ s trying to live up to “Cube” . In addition, when Clive finally under-stands the disturbed reasoning that’s been going on in Elsa’s head, his reaction is one of the few moments where “Splice” lives up to the emo-tional-horror label. 
Not to say that the film is with-
out its purported tender moments. 
“It’s really a mother-daughter 
story, ” Natali said. “The primary relationship in the film is Elsa and Dren. ” 
That dynamic would have 
come through a little more if “Splice” took the time to estab-lish such details. Instead, viewers are railroaded through a series of abrupt revelations: Elsa had a bad relationship with her dead mother. Aforementioned dead mother had a farm. Clive and Elsa need to hide Dren from their company.
The movie’s full of faux emotion-
ally charged moments, like Clive trying to drown an already choking Dren and — surprise! — it turns out Dren can breathe underwater. Elsa, thinking he saved their pseudo-daughter from choking to death, asks, “How did you know?” Clive just shrugs, and that’s about all you can do too. 
“Splice” does have moments 
where it goes deeper than the sur-face. In the end, the characters don’t have any more depth than before, but the effect is so bizarre that it sets “Splice” apart from other creature shockers.

Associate Hiatus EditorARCADE FIRE
THE SUBURBS
You’re walking through an inde-pendent record store, flipping idly through some 12-inch singles, 
searching for the obscure artists your hipster heart desires, when — all of a sudden — you stumble across a sleeveless record, blank except for one very impor-tant band name. It’s the new single from Arcade Fire. Y ou have just struck gold. 
That’s exactly how the Montreal 
band has packaged the new tunes from their forthcoming LP , The Suburbs. 
When the first record turned up at a shop in Glasgow, the Internet exploded with buzz over the new tracks, and inevita-bly, the single and B-side — “Suburbs” and “Month of May, ” respectively — have been leaked.
“Suburbs” is typical Arcade Fire fare: 
Slow, melodic piano builds over the gen-tle strum of acoustic guitar as frontman Win Butler spews his best imitation-Springsteen  lyrics about growing up in 
the heartland. Meanwhile, “Month of May” offers a curiously aggressive rock sound — more befitting Queens of the Stone Age than the reserved Arcade Fire. It seems strange, but hot damn, it actually works.
Still, compared to the moments of 
pure brilliance on their previous record-ings, the new tracks don’t quite measure up. Then again, it’s a hard task to follow two nearly perfect albums; let’s just hope The Suburbs has a few more gems in store.

Half a decade ago, on 
Wednesday of Week 10, I was already dreaming 
of this day: The Last Production. Outgoing Guardian  pillars like 
Grant, Vlad, Ian and Cody — gods in my eyes — were drowning their seniorities in some Arrogant Bastard while I sat miserable in my fugly attempt at a Summer Movie Preview design. I bush-whacked blind through a first-ever round of edits; meanwhile, then-
Hiatus Editor Cody blasted SoCal 
pop-punk (the Bouncing Soles, who still hold a special place in my iPod) and proceeded to get so sloshed he barely got his album review in before dusk.
My only consolation was that, 
one day, it would be me in the party hat.
It’s tradition: The restless crew 
of outgoing seniors is supposed to get drunk and stumble around the office the last day, jeering the incoming editors until they regret the day they decided to apply. I wish I could sit back and savor their pain with some fine boxed wine. But my state of sober (sort of) stress today is a testa-ment to the over-involved, often psycho grip with which I run the Guardian . For the good of every-
one, it’ s my time to move on.
All through Fall Quarter, there 
was a knot of worry in my gut that UCSD’s official newspaper wouldn’t be equipped to uphold its history of greatness next year. About one month after meeting incumbent Editor in Chief Angela 
Chen, though, it had disappeared 
completely. Angela: Because of you, I will be able to take on my future without looking back with fear or regret. Y ou never deserved an eye-roll— not even once. Y ou’re the most open, honest learner I’ve encountered at this school; you lis-ten, you’re never overconfident or defensive, and you ask questions. 
For that, you will be rewarded with skill. Guaranteed. Keep keep-
ing it real, and come 2013, you too could be spraying Four Loko off the hood of your Corolla in the 7-11 parking lot.
To the rest of the incomers: 
Y our work this quarter has sur-passed my wildest expectations. 
Hayley: Y ou’re the strongest writer 
on staff. Read more Esquire, and 
you’ll be downright bomb. Arielle: Y ou’re an angel, and you know your shit. Keep my baby classy. Neda: Focus, but never let go of Hiatus — it suits you. Cheryl: Y ou’re the glue, and that’s every-thing. Take more photos, but demand more massages. Regina: Y ou surprise me every day. Keep 
it up. Liam: Y ou’re my favorite. 
Especially for standing up to us when we’re assholes. Masha: I never thought strict could be so sweet. Enforce the schedule like I never could. Melody: Have fun with that shit. I secretly want your job. Trevor: Come KELSEY MARRU J

My time at the Guardian  has 
been somewhat of a real-
life nightmare. In my four-
year career as a writer and editor, I have endured far too many Redbull-fueled all-nighters, faced countless 3 a.m. disasters and lived beneath the rainy cloud of a perpetual deadline. In fact, the only time I’ve ever really been able to escape the G is when I’m 
asleep. But like I said, I don’t sleep very often.
Still, as I reminisce about my 
monotonous academic career at UCSD, it was usually the only good reason to be awake in the first place. 
Not to rag on all my lit/writing cours-
es, but the terrifying gaze of 20,000 
undergraduate eyes sort of scared me into improvement. Instead of a comfy workshop circle to test out my ideas, there was just a crowd of ruth-less twentysomethings ready to say “Y ou suck. ” So thanks, even if you’re the most noncommittal Guardian  
reader — my fear of your judgment has made me better at my job.
The way I see it, if it weren’t for 
this paper, I would still be writing bad poems in my Moleskin, waiting to graduate so I could move on to undefined bigger, better things. The Guardian  has taught me to live in 
the moment in the most intense way possible — even if that means letting other parts of my life fall apart. 
 Besides maybe inserting the word 
“poopy” into an editorial a couple weeks ago, I have no regrets. I know what’s important to me now, and that’s all I ever really wanted from college. I’m also guessing that, after thousands of hours of slave labor at an understaffed publication, I will probably never have to work this hard again in my life.
Now for shout-outs: Matt M., 
when I first joined, your infectious laugh and epic parties made me drool with admiration. Hadley, now that I’ve worked with you, I know I can work with anyone. Dave, thanks for adopting Focus when it needed a no-fluff parent most, and for the leopard couch. We still need to visit 
that beehive.
Trevor, since you survived that 
Wedge nightmare, I’ve always know 
you were one helluva trooper. Hayley, thanks for not quitting after I stood you up at 6 a.m. last year. Cheryl, I wish you could massage me until the end of time. Angela, girl, you da boss now — ’nuff said. Emily, I love your droopy office dance. Vishal, I’m mak-
ing the Jamaican horn sound for you 
as I type. Kelsey, you’re cute enough to rival some big-time Y ouTube kitten videos, and you’re a really dedicated worker to boot. Edwin, it’s going to be you plus me plus hot sake this Friday — and many NY outings to come. 
Sari and Shida: It might not seem 
like much, but the fact that you read what we write every week means a lot. Thanks for being the perfect distractions — without all those dance parties and delicious dinners, I would’ve overdosed on Guardian . 
Reza and Simone: I’ve tried not 
to spew Sun God-esque affection this whole sendoff, but what the hell. I love you guys. Reza, you’re my trusty coworker and friend, and I will always appreciate how well you handled me breaking your tooth. I’m going to miss being shady and jaded with you.
Simone, my Guardian  recruiter 
and yearlong companion: There were many Winter Quarter moments where you could’ve settled for a slightly shoddier paper, but you never did, and I’ll admire you forever for it. 
No matter how much time we spent 
together, I never really got sick of you (that’s my way of saying you rock). If you ever consider launching your fuckup career on the East Coast, I’ll make sure to scope you some sturdy cardboard boxes. In the meantime, take good care of Clubby for me.
Newbies, I can’t wait to see what 
you’ve got. It’s all in your hands now.

"44 0$*"5&/&84&%*503t$"3500/*45 There is something profoundly 
different about newspaper people. Resilient, unpredict-
able, dangerously curious and decid-edly unconcerned with their own well-being, they are a breed designed for action. They work strange hours and harbor strange habits. They deprive themselves of food, sleep, social interaction and anything else indicative of a sane human exis-tence. They admire efficiency. They abhor waste. They are egomaniacs — admittedly vain, overly ambi-tious, disgustingly self-confident and completely self-aware. In private, they are idealists. In public, they are vocal skeptics, averse to the flowery bullshit of rhetorical activism and entirely unimpressed by the self-sustaining fanfare of institutional politics. They are the most loyal of friends, the most critical of enemies and the most prolific of shit talkers. They are up-front. They are real. They tend to look pretty haggard most of the time, but they wear it well.
Over the last four years, I have 
had the immense pleasure of being surrounded by newspaper people for the majority of my waking moments, and a few too many of my non-wak-ing moments. Though I have given up more than I will ever know to be a part of this organization, these people — who I am honored to call my friends — have made every sec-ond entirely worth it. 
To Charles and the rest of the old 
guard (Rael, McCardle and Hadley): Y ou guys took me in, brought me up and made me feel at home here. Charles, you taught me how to be critical of everything, and for that I cannot thank you enough. Rael, you are the chillest son of a bitch around, and I am confident that — had I never met you — I would be a con-siderably lamer person.
To Jesse, Kim and Y elena: We 
were the news crew. I could always depend on you for quality reporting, much-needed moral support and cutty back-room sessions. 
To Alyssa: Although I am the 
single most talented writer in the world, I cannot find the words on Thesaurus.com to describe how much your friendship means to me. There is no one else I would rather have spent four years on the Guardian  with than you. Y ou 
were a better managing editor than me. Don’t let that go to your head, though. 
To Simone: Y ou are something 
new — raw, unyielding, completely committed to the rejection of any and all things conventional. Arguing with you is like arguing with a tiger that coughs a lot. For that, I love you, and I can’t stress enough how great a job you’ve done as chief. I would sing like Justin Bieber if I thought it would make you happy. 
To Phil: Y ou are my brother. Y ou 
give life to the bizarre things in my head. Y ou inspire me to be a bet-ter artist. Y ou are one of the most talented creative minds I know, and it has been an absolute joy to work with you this past year. And we’re just getting started. 
To Emily: Y ou have never once 
failed to amaze me with the work you produce. I don’t know how you do it, but you are an endless pool of artistic skill and deadpan humor rolled into one tiny, twirling, dash-tastic bundle of awesomeness. LOST.
To Edwin: Fuck you, bitch. Y ou 
are the funniest motherfucker I know.
To Angela and Hayley: My girls. 
I am so proud of how far both of you have come this year. Thank you for sticking it out, rising bril-liantly to the task and being the best damn news writers this paper has seen since that guy Reza graduated. Y ou’re going to do a phenomenal job next year. I know we’re leaving the Guardian  in capable hands. 
To Trevor: If I had to pick 12 
people to be in my ultimate party crew, you would be number six.
To Kelsey: I am jealous of your 
copy-editing skills.
To Cheryl and Arielle: Road-
trip posse for life. Please play good music at production next year.
To Vishal: My method is still 
superior. Put that in your pipe and smoke it. 
And to all of the rest of you who 
have shaped my experience at the Guardian : Thank you for being the 
zaniest, hardest-working, most over-the-top crew of intellectual misfits I have ever known. Being around you has made me a more complete person.

HIATUS EDITOR
Film critics know that every good 
movie has a good ending. Don’t worry, I won’t spoon-feed you a 
load of a crap about happily-ever-afters, but I will say this: After four years of toil-ing over quotations, semicolons and em dashes, I’m going out with a bang.
If you told me four years ago that one 
day I would be Hiatus editor, I would have laughed in your face. I never spoke up at newspaper meetings, my favorite film is “Little Miss Sunshine” and I may or may not have symptoms of Bieber fever. But before you judge me, I’ll bet even A.O. Scott taps his foot when-ever Britney Spears comes on the radio. Honestly, when did pretension become such a redeeming quality? 
If always agreeing with the Academy’s 
picks for best films of the year makes you an authority in the arts-and-entertain-ment realm, then revoke my title. 
Truth is: If the rhythm moves me, I’m 
going to dance. I don’t need some Rolling Stone writer to tell me what music I like. If Sandra Bullock’s Oscar win for “The Blind Side” is any indication, fame is little more than a popularity contest.
Every time I walk into an AMC, I 
find myself wondering: What happened to Hollywood? Sorry, but book adapta-tions, remakes, substance-empty chick flicks, recycled Michael Bay-splosions and five “Bring It On” sequels do not count as innovation.
Is a well-developed storyline, visually 
stunning cinematography, witty script, multidimensional characters, actors who are right for the roles (not simply hired for their entertainment value)  and 
an overall message that really makes us think too much to ask? 12THE UCSD GUARDIAN  THURSDAY , JUNE 3, 2010  SENIOR SENDOFF

Ishould start learning karate now. Or maybe Jiu-Jitsu. Hell, even Tae Bo would 
be a step in the right direction. After four years of talking some serious smack, I’m graduating, and I have to stop hiding up in the ivory tower of my Guardian  
columns. This means that the many people I offended — most-ly Dodgers and Y ankees fans, but also fair amounts of pro-Israel, Obama-loving, Prius-driving middle-class elites — would love a chance to share their “opin-ions” with me in person. 
I’m not too worried about 
taking on the folks angered by my progressive politics, but I do not want to meet a pissed-off New Y orker in a dark alley. 
In any case, the time has 
finally come to leave the Guardian , UCSD and Southern 
California behind. As much as I am overjoyed to be done with college and start some new adventures, I’m actually pretty sad to say goodbye to the people and experiences that made my time here so great, and a lot of that credit needs to go to the best damn newspaper in the country.
I got my start with the 
Guardian  as a sports writer when 
two high school friends and former sports editors — Rael Enteen and Danai Leininger — convinced me to start writing. Those first articles covering the bottom of UCSD’s sports totem poll got me going, and for four years, I wrote as much as I could get my hands on. As a sopho-more, I felt comfortable enough to branch out into other sections. By my senior year, I had hit the proverbial Guardian  cycle: hav-

years of college. One winter’s day in 
2009, they noticed my sloppy copy-reader application, jerked me into the nearest swivel chair, handed me some new-hire paperwork and stamped a big, invisible “G” on my forehead. I was in.
I had no idea how to assimilate. It 
took a full weeks to realize that “copy” meant me. I’ d miss a million AP mis-takes. One of my first news grabs ended up in a blubbering phone call to then-news editor Reza because my contact wasn’t calling me back. (Bitch.) 
That low-key anxiety attack sud-
denly made me a part of the Guardian 
in-crowd. After initiation, I came to understand the people behind the titles:
Simone, you are the most empower-
ing woman, keeping us in check but still embodying the edginess of Ke$ha 24/7. Trevor, my favorite, how can you write poetry, place articles, eat sand-wiches and play deejay on Y ouTube simultaneously? My section, I’m so proud of you guys for breaking out of copy’s stereotypical wallflower persona, what with Monica’s requests to chain up the dog and Masha’s passive-aggressive post-its telling everyone to lay off our computers’ balls. Original sports editor Jake and his successor, Vishal: Y ou both have a Disney prince-like charm that always makes me mosey (extra slowly) past the sports office. Alyssa, you are truly superwoman, showing the world that we UCSD kids can work hard and party hard, no sweat. Edwin, you’re the master of dance, sloshball and sex jokes — how can I be cool like you? Hayley and Angela, I’m always amazed at your politeness, apologizing whenever you ask me to copy read something (aka do my job). Reza, you better believe I will be spicing up your Facebook once a week now that I can’t bombard you with cheer in person anymore — and last but never least, Cheryl, you could make a Guardian  gossip zine with your endless 
knowledge. I know it’s creepy, but I want to keep you in my pocket forever.
In a nutshell, I’ve been in love with 
the Guardian  for a year.  So much that 
I slept with bugs, peed in a bush, ate a barely cooked hot dog, listened to scary stories about Toys R Us and got bitched out by Sue the park ranger for blasting Julie Andrews last weekend — yet some-how, I would do it all over in a second.

Staying in San Diego wasn’t the 
god-awful decision I imag-ined it’ d be. In my defense, I’ d 
already spent 18 years here before everyone else showed up. And during that time, I’ d firmly decided I didn’t like the ocean, Shamu nor short-sleeved shirts.
Don’t get me wrong — not every-
thing’s changed. I still don’t care for the ocean, or Shamu. But I’ve come to terms with San Diego; if only because the last four years have been worth all the salt water in the world. 
Like other exhausted interests, 
journalism was something I picked up on a half-whim. Film came before it. Matter of fact, film was the reason I started writing for the Guardian in 
the first place. It took three applica-tions (ahem, Simone), but because of it, I spent the next three years of my life swallowing NoDoz three times a week. Needless to say, it was the best decision I ever made in college.However, I’ d be lying if I said that 
the Guardian  was the only thing that 
made these last four years so amaz-ing. I have others to thank too.
To Mom and Dad: Thank you for 
your continued love, support, Triton Cash and text messages that I know take five minutes to type. I love you so much. Adriana: I still read the let-ter you typed on my (then-new) lap-top from time to time — the one in electric green. And yes, I remember pretending to be beached mermaids lost at shore. Next year’s going to be amazing. Trust me.
To Rah: I know I’ve told you this 
before, but there’s no one I admire more. I can’t wait to visit the obe-lisk again. To Carmina and Y edid: Thanks for letting me be your little brother, and for convincing me my Spanish wasn’t as terrible as it was. 
And now, for Guardian  folks. To 
Ke$ — sorry, Simone: How someone could be so silly, sexy and damn good at turning out headlines amazes me. I’m honored to end my tenure with you at the helm. Alyssa and Reza: The managing office was by far my favorite, and not because of the beer closet in the corner. Sake’s on me this Friday, but only the first cup.
To News, the girls who stroked 
every ligament of my musical ego: Much love, and many nights filled with the best of the ’80s. Hiatus: My alma mater and the greatest section to write for — hands down. Thanks for putting up with my leftovers, and the eight weeks that they rotted there for. And Sports: May your lives be a never-ending series of Jamaican Horn moments.
Emily: Words can’t describe 
the magic you conjured up, every Sunday, to turn Focus into art. And to Aprille, Neda and Zoe: Y ou were three of the most talented associates I had the fortune of working with. The pleasure was all mine.

back. Y ou’re needed.
This year’s seniors are probably a little more 
aware of how much I love them. Alyssa: We’re the 
same person (only you, like, get shit done), and I can’t imagine life without you. It’s going to be weird. Reza: I forgive you for dropping me, and for going to DC. Most of all I’m just stoked you’re not going back. Kelsey: How does one become as nice as you? It boggles my mind. Emily: Y ou surpassed me so long ago — I’m in awe. Vishal: Y ou’re the life of this party. Thanks for transfer-ring. Edwin: Am I cool enough to be your friend yet? Please? Shida: I adore watching you sleep, but I wish we were dancing instead. Sari: Here’s to our cardboard box in Santa Monica. Let’s never be apart again, OK? Wes: Oh wait — you’re not a senior. Love you anyway.
Lastly, I offer my apologies to all those whose 
dreams I may have deferred this year with a half-raised eyebrow and a stupid red pen. The best leaders foster talent by instilling confidence — I never quite got the hang of that. To the A.S. councilmembers, the co-ops and whoever else we might have offended by misspelling your name or misunderstanding your cause: We know you’re just students too. But everyone needs a watchdog to keep them on their toes. Truce?

amazing things happened to fit into one measly column, but shout-outs need to go first and fore-most to the 2010 Guardian  sloshball champions. 
We showed heart, determination, unbelievable beer-drinking skills and an unmatched intel-lect to put those asshole Koalas in their place. Few things will ever feel so good as seeing Kris Gregorian go down like a sack of moldy potatoes. 
The people who made my Guardian  tenure 
unforgettable — specifically, my time as sports editor — include the following sexy beasts: Emily for being the greatest (and most patient) design editor on the planet; Janani and Matt for mob-bing it as my associate editors and for keeping me sane; and Erik for helping keep the sports office the chillest of them all by always cracking (bad) jokes and watching sports 24/7. 
Besides being great editors and leaders, 
Simone, Reza and Alyssa are all still some of the coolest people I met at UCSD, which made working for them so much better. And Vishal, I can never thank you enough for letting me pass the torch to you; the section has never looked better. 
So after four years of “Blanc on Base, ” I guess 
it’s time for me to round third and head home. 
P .S. Fuck the Dodgers, GO GIANTS. associate sports editor. This year, I wanted to play a larger part with the paper. I expected that Sundays and Wednesdays would turn into long days and more responsibility. What I didn’t expect was that the relationships I’ve built would define my senior year. From hazy nights in Vegas to an epic sloshball win, it truly has been an, uh, somewhat memorable year. 
On the more professional side, we have debat-
ed extensively over the meaning of athleticism, and you continued to grind away sports lingo to increase the accessibility of articles to the general public. Out of these arguments, I hope that you have come to learn more about sports than you ever wished you had — I know that I, for one, have come to appreciate the literal meanings of words far more than I care.  
We sports snobs often times get caught up in 
stylistic meaning without concern for compre-hension. I hope future Guardian  staffers and edi-
tors can build the same (sometimes adversarial) collegiality that we developed over the year.  
My only regret with the Guardian is not 
joining sooner. I’ll take solace in knowing that I made the most of this year. To the drinks we’ve shared and the good times we’ve had, this toast is over. Let’s chug some beer.At the theater, no matter how open-minded  
I try to be, I always end up rolling my eyes at an awkward Michael Cera, Kristen Stewart twirling her greasy strands or the Coen brothers basking in their own cleverness. 
After four years of reviewing film — 95 per-
cent of which was uninspired — you’ d think I’ d have lost all faith in the industry. But amid the underproduced fodder that gets churned out at the box office each week, there’s always a glim-mer of hope. Though few and far between, great films do get produced, and I — along with all other tortured buff — will hold on with every last ounce of faith until the next one arrives. 
On that silver lining, I’ll end with shout-outs. Simone: Thanks for taking a chance on a 
nobody whose application was a shoddy “Lion King” theater review. It may have taken a year of rewrites before I wrote anything worth pub-lishing, but my debut 50-word blurb on “The Holiday” still hangs from my refrigerator. 
Dad and Mom: I don’t hate every film in 
the universe; I just have high standards. Y es — “Snakes on a Plane” really is one of the worst movies of all time. It didn’t really take me 20 min-utes to go get popcorn.
Oh, and Nicolas Cage: Get a day job.

Though her debut album was only a few years 
ago, Miley Cyrus is preparing for a precari-ous leap across the teen-adult divide. With 
the June 18 release of Can’t Be Tamed , Cyrus 
ditches her all-American digs for a she-woman roar. The titular track features the diva’s signature Tennessee croon, set to a heavy techno-dance synth borrowed from last year’s “Party in the U.S.A. ” The new track, however, noticeably abandons the latter’s bubblegum sound for more mature club tracks — a sonic shift that one can assume continues throughout the album. Phasing out the sickly-sweet singles that dominated her previous album, Can’t Be Tamed  trades in lyr-
ics about butterfly-inducing first dates for lyrics about abusive relationships.
The change is expected for the teen, who has 
gradually followed the familiar “I’m a grownup now!” path that Britney and Christina slithered down years before. While the darker, sexual lyr-ics about how all the guys want her are sure to set fans of Cyrus’ good-girl image on edge, perhaps it’s for the better — Considering her almost robotic penchant for foot-in-mouth syndrome (she managed to shit about Thom Y orke, Jay-Z and her own single), Cyrus hasn’t always had her Disney persona on lock.
If a Poison cover and a scantily clad music 
video isn’t enough to convince you that the for-mer Hannah Montana star is ready for the grind, then her new badass black duds will — 1992 birth date be damned.

KNIGHT

THE TWILIGHT SAGA: ECLIPSE
As a respite from the summer heat and slews of action films, director David Slade’s “The Twilight 
Saga: Eclipse” will take you back to the somber forest of Forks, Washington for the third install-ment of the box office smash series. Picking up after 2009’s cliffhanger — where Edward pro-
posed to Bella and the vampires and werewolves forged an unholy alliance  — “Eclipse” is the stuff that shrieking fangirls and million-dollar movies are made of. 
With the same cast of perfectly-sculpted, vapid characters, fans shouldn’t expect a huge improve-
ment. All the bland “Twilight” staples are sure to cameo: Kristen Stewart will moodily tousle her hair, Taylor Lautner’s whine is sure to recall his prepubescent “Cheaper by the Dozen 2” performance and Robert Pattinson will groan this way through all  90 minutes with a hazy, angst-fueled deadpan. But 
why bother with warnings? Crippling shame or no, you’re still going to be dropping $10.50 at the midnight premiere decked out in fangs and a Team Edward tank that’s as sparkly as he is.

Staff WriterJack Johnson’s fifth stu-dio album, To The Sea,  
is just as uninspired 
as its title suggests. While the 13 songs don’t stray far from Johnson’s typical style — laid-back jams ripe with acoustic strumming, lightweight drums and care-free beach-day vocals — the tracks blur together until the album’s reduced to a never-ending bonfire sing-along.
Working out of his 
solar-powered studios in Hawaii and Los Angeles, Johnson has nailed the chill, environmentally-friendly, beach-bro image to perfec-tion — but it’s hard to take the perpetually stoned surf-er facade seriously when the guy’s released four albums and fathered two children.
The lyrics continue in 
the same vein. Instead of providing genuine, mean-ing we’re lost in a swarm of confusing metaphors. “Red Wine, Mistakes, Mythology” sounds like the product of one too many glasses of Merlot, as it finds Johnson stringing together muddled phrases like “little crying robots. ”
Johnson attempts to 
supplement his usual sim-plistic acoustic guitar sound by sporadically adding flowing keyboard, reverb-heavy electric guitar and a healthy dose of tambourine throughout the album. But this attempt at variety only steers Johnson fur-ther off course — the intro on the title track sounds like a Shins ripoff, while “No Good With Faces” is a drugged-out Brandon Flowers impersonation.
The album does have 
its moments, particularly with “When I Look Up, ” a minute-long collection of running water noises, xylo-phone plunking and a cho-rus of background singers. Too bad the album’s best song is its shortest.
Johnson’s fifth attempt 
isn’t all bad. In fact, it’s pleasant in all the same way smoking a bowl is. But as charming as that might be, To The Sea still feels as 
though we are trapped on a boat in the middle of the ocean — water everywhere gets a little redundant.     — Amanda Martinek

After the success of his “Mission: Impossible” action 
thrillers, it seems as if Tom Cruise is finally tak-ing a turn at self-parody. His new film, “Knight and Day, ” has him indulging in slapstick shootouts and absurd one-liners, with the likes of, “No one follows us, or I kill myself and then her. ” Cameron Diaz comes through with the sex appeal, playing the distressed, unsuspect-ing civilian to Cruise’s wisecracking secret agent. The formula may be overused, but the star power of Diaz and Cruise all but ensure a financial windfall for this June release — though critical acclaim for this light-weight film is anything but a guarantee.

If your Spring Quarter 
grades have got you down this summer, 
“Meet the Parents” director Jay Roach has got just the schadenfreuden remedy for your intellectual insecurities: Dinner for Schmucks, a movie about laugh-ing at dumb people. Tim (played by “Knocked Up” alumnus Paul Rudd) is an ambitious suit looking to climb the corporate ladder. Just when he thinks he’s at the verge of a promotion, he’s given one more obstacle: He must find an idiot and bring him to his boss’ Dinner for Extraordinary People — an event where asshole businessmen show off their pedigree idiots for a grand prize promotion.
As it just so happens, Tim meets 
Barry (Steve Carell), a wide-eyed dim-wit with a thing for dressing up dead mice. Much to the dismay of his empa-thetic girlfriend, Tim invites Barry to the dinner. Though it seems for a moment that the duo’s unlikely friend-ship might hinder Tim from bringing Barry to the freak show, the two go anyway. It’s a simple story, and, if little else, it’ s sure to be packed with Carell’ s signature shtick — scene after scene of cringe-worthy discomfort. Once “Schmucks” hits theatres July 13, one thing’s sure: No other slacker summer activity will make you feel smarter.

Get him to the Greek” is the spin-off of “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” we’ve been clamouring for since 
Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) first got into that bitchy blonde’spants in 2008. Now in his very own feature-length fol-low-up, “Greek, ” Snow has fallen off the sobriety wagon entirely — prompting the rock legend to partake in a string of motel-trashing ragers, absinthe binges and celebrity debauchery.
The grandeur doesn’t last long. 
Following the release of a racist ditty, Snow is quickly crushed under the pile of tabloid outrage that descends upon him. His career seems to have finally reached its breaking point. Fortunately for Snow, optimistic record label intern Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) — the drool-ing fan boy in “Sarah Marshall” — sug-gests to his hard-ass boss Sergio (Sean “P . Diddy” Combs) that Snow stage his comeback at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles. “Greek” follows the resulting mayhem as a frantic Green tries to get Snow from London to L.A. in time for the big show.
There’s no doubt that the cast is 
bizarre — but the mix works surpris-ingly well for the film.
The film mocks Brand’s very public 
past of sex and drug addiction, utiliz-ing his character’s outrageous persona to satirize a society fixated on fame and mocks his. He delivers side-splitters with ease, and his performance is a delusional and drug-addled one, stum-bling through the streets of Las Vegas in search of a fix — it’s a sequence so organic it seems that he’s done it before. 
Not to be outdone, Diddy surprises 
us in his first comedic role as an intim-idating boss. He wrenches laughter from an unsuspecting audience with one-liner gems like “I’m mind-fucking the shit out of you right now” capping off the film’s brilliant comedic tim-ing. By contrast, Hill — a comparative expert in the role of the funnyman — disappoints as Diddy’s lapdog.  The “Superbad” veteran is sidelined in “Greek” as a naïve newcomer who attempts to capture audience sympa-thies, but fails to please with his overea-ger demeanor. 
Nonetheless, “Greek” possesses a 
coveted ability to transport the audi-ence into the helter-skelter mayhem of celebrity life, all while inducing laugh-ter. The well-crafted comedic backbone of this summer flick is sure to make “Greek” the 2010 equivalent of  “The Hangover”— brimming with swearing, confusion and a fuckload of alcohol.

On the heels of last year’s Relapse  is this year’s Recovery : Eminem’s new 
concept album and sonic 180. He’s continuing on the path to maturity 
and sobriety, and, given that he spent a good part of 2005 through 
2008 binging on pills and booze, this release proves he’s already undergone a vast improvement. If first single “Not Afraid” is any indication, the album’s sure to feature triumphant, orchestral arrangements, backed by pulsating beats, heavy bass and Shady’s vicious wit. Unlike previous albums, Recovery  
is the rapper’s first album without a single appearance from Dre. Instead, Eminem’s latest will feature pop princesses like Pink and Rihanna — cer-tainly a departure from what we know of the often misogynistic Mathers (after all, it was only 10 years ago when he was taking shots at Christina Aguilera on “The Real Slim Shady”). Since then Eminem’s been on quite the rollercoaster, alternating between musical genius and personal crash-and burns — perhaps now he has finally beaten his demons.

Iconsider myself to be an adaptable, “go-with-
the-flow” kind of person. I’ve experienced enough change in my life to know that it’s a 
fact of life that ought to be embraced, not resisted.
Now, perched on the precipice of graduation, 
if only I could just conjure that wisdom, because right now, I feel a little empty.
I can’t fight a creeping vulnerability as I face 
up to the unnerving realization I have been trying to ignore for quite sometime now: college is over.
Truth is, if someone asked me at the school 
year’s start if I was ready to graduate, my answer would have been “hell yes. ” I had never forged the “home away from home, best years of my life” collegiate experience that so many rave about.
My first two years at UC Riverside, I felt 
oppressed by the lack of commonalities between (at least what I thought was) a shallow-minded, intellectually uninspired student body and myself. I had a handful of good friends and few college- defining experiences I appreciated. I felt a sense of loss that I had missed out on “the good times. ” .
When I transferred to UCSD, the cynicism 
that my time at Rivershit had cultivated per-severed, and fit in seamlessly with the hordes of zombie students. But my senior year was an awakening of sorts, and it’s no coincidence my collegiate life finally became fulfilling when I joined the Guardian  staff. Y ou guys have enriched 
my life.
To the Guardian  staff, word count constraints 
prevent me from writing to each of you individu-ally, because if I did, you all would have page-long essays. But if I have worked with you in the office on a regular basis, then know this: The time we have spent together this year has made this past year the best of my life to date (sorry, can’t help it). Y ou bunch of quirky, funny, unique, endearing group of intelligent people are the kind I always thought college was supposed to intro-duce to me. The memories of our times together will be ingrained on my heart as long as it beats, as they’ve transformed my experience in college from one of indifference to one I don’t want to see end. Thank you for touching my life, and I’m humbled to have had this opportunity.
I had way more in this, but it wouldn’t be 
authentic if I didn’t  have to edit my work down.

Photography has always been a conun-
drum for me: I believe it is more important to live the moment than to 
necessarily capture the moment; I would far rather be in front of a lens than behind one; I do not like the constant pressure of getting the perfect shot, but the perfect shot is what I always want; and although I live with the camera, you will not likely see me with my camera, unless I am on an assignment. Y et despite everything, I love capturing the emotion and human spirit of every event or place I have been.
I want to thank the Guardian  for the 
honor and privilege of serving the students and faculty at UCSD for the past four years. The work has been personally rewarding, and I can deny the occasional pleasure in the recognition of fellow students for the work I so love.
A big “thank you” is extended to every 
editor who has ever worked in the sports section (Danai, Rael, Janani, Jake, Matt, Vishal and Liam). Y ou’ve all made our time together at the Guardian  hilariously enter-
taining and enjoyable. Emily, thank you for working with my pictures when I could not capture your intent; your designs were always awesome! To John: Y ou are the man, good luck next year. I am certain you’ll make the paper look good. 
To everyone else, it’s been a pleasure 
working with you; I love you all. So this is Erik closing the lens cover one last time for the Guardian . Have an awesome, grand, fan-
tastic, great, stellar … grand day!
Oh yeah, and “Lionhearts” are the best 
thing to happen to photography since … ever. And in regard to photography, I am certain the Guardian  sets the standard for 
other California college newspapers.
We have set a high bar of accomplish-
ment that I am sure future staff will carry forward.ART EDITOR

Admittedly, my stint at the Guardian  was sort of 
impersonal, as I spent less 
time forming relationships and more time making my comics and illustrations look as badass as pos-sible. That’s not to say that I don’t have my fair share of apprecia-tion for the Guardian . It gave me 
a sense of purpose and direction when I lacked it most, and despite my emotional detachment from the paper, I’m forever grateful for the Guardian ’ s effect on my 
life and the relationships that I’ve formed there.
I’ d like to thank Chris 
Kokiousis for giving me my start. Without his encouragement, his love of video games and his creation of my column, I would never have seen the Guardian  as a legit cre-
ative venue. Thanks, Christina Aushana, for hiring me as an illus-trator and giving me a chance to unload my emotional woes on our undergraduate population. Had she not suggested that I draw a comic, Sunny-Side Up would never have been birthed. Consequently, I’ d like to thank Simone and anyone else involved in my hiring as Art Editor for giving me the liberty to extend my mopey story throughout the rest 
the year. Without that option, 
I don’t think I would have 
ever written my own 
comic novel.
I’ d like to thank 
Reza for his vision and preference for 
my particular artis-
tic style. Had he not 
continually approached 
me with new ideas, I would 
never have swung by the office as much as I did. I’ d also like to thank him for our collaborative efforts, which I find to have been one of the most fulfilling opportunities the Guardian  has allowed me (next to 
Sunny-Side Up). But mostly, he’s someone I could talk to when I was emo-ing out. Thanks, man.
I’ d like to thank Emily for her 
peppy personality, juxtaposed against a usually irritated demeanor. I always found this to be a splen-did surprise. I’ d like to thank Erik for his sense of humor — which, against Emily’s personality, was the best comic relief in the office. I’ d also like to thank Vishal Natarajan, whose heart-to-hearts in and out of the office always kept me grounded in the here and now.  Incidentally, I’ d also like to thank his drunken alter-ego for embodying all the ’70s Jack Nicholson sleaze that I didn’t know actually existed.
I’ d like to thank News, Opinion, 
Focus and Hiatus for dealing with my tardiness. Having never been the most punctual artist, I appreci-ate that they dealt with me ’til the very end. The same to the manag-ing editors. I’ d also like to thank the art team for taking me seriously.  I never thought myself the most com-petent individual, and their etiquette toward my rank was humbling. 
Finally, I’ d like to thank the 
Guardian  for setting me up with 
Kim Cyprian, the new art editor and fellow artist extraordinaire, whose existence has created an altogether new fear of life and death that I never once fathomed in my overabundant imagination.  Never has life seemed so vast and adven-turous until now. Thanks.
Never having been very good 
at goodbyes, I’ll just say: Thanks, Guardian . I’ll see you around.

DESIGN EDITOREMILY KU
In true Guardian  fashion, I’m writ-
ing this following a 5 a.m. produc-tion — after which I headed home 
not to sleep, but to prepare for a discussion I had to teach at 8 a.m. I’ve got InDesign open because I still have to design Sports, Photoshop open because I’m trying to plan the image that’s supposed to go with it, and the last five text messages I’ve received (and the last seven I’ve sent) have been 
Guardian -related.
How do you just walk away from some-
thing so all-encompassing? How do you 
reconcile what has been your entire life with the mystery that is to come?
The other day, Neda and Liam were 
arguing over whose section I was more loyal to, Focus or Sports. (I wasn’t sure if it was the right time to point out that the debate was moot, because neither of them will be 
getting me next year.) Richard only gave 
Focus to me because no one else wanted it, but Alyssa had my back from the beginning, taking unfortunate creative liberties with Michael Capparelli’s artwork. I wouldn’t have wanted anyone else with me every step of the way. Dave humored me when I had my epiphany last winter (or psychotic break, however you want to look at it), until he realized I was dead serious — and so “The Memory Remains” went to print. 
Edwin kept right in step with me this 
entire year, always dependable, always positive, and never saying a word when he was stuck in the office at 3 a.m. because I’ d thrown out three different designs. Once the dust from Focus reconstruction settled, Sports was next. Janani, the only person I would ever share an office and “Lost” with, 
and Jake, Vishal, Matt and Liam: It’s your 
enthusiasm and pride that inspires my love for designing your section. No section is more fun to work with. Can we say the rest is Guardian  history?
I sometimes think about how terrible 
my timing is, becoming so attached to print media when it’s on its way out. But I’m only lucky to have found this part of my stressball self when I did, uncovered by a hodgepodge 
of scrappy journalists you can’t find any-
where else.
With design, it was Simone who was my best critic, and Reza my best friend. Simone, you can weather any storm. Design never fails because of you; I don’t know how you do it all. Reza, I can’t think of the word “col-lab” without thinking of you, and no one can seem to call me Em Dash quite the same way. I’ll be looking for that telltale resilient bird when you become famous.
Angela and Hayley, all I know is that 
you guys are going to do the Guardian  
proud. Melody, I have the utmost faith in you. Remember that you are only at your beginning, looking back on my ending. Just a heads-up: you’re going to be everyone’s favorite person. I couldn’t have asked for a 
more promising successor.
And Erik: No words can really say. As 
Dave said, the war is almost over. But I 
wouldn’t have traded the ride for anything.
A designer’s work is always seen but 
never known. It’s always a journey, but it’s always worth it. To everyone, thank you. I don’t know how else to say it. I would end with an em dash — but I wouldn’t be able to qualify it with anything more amazing than 
the people who make that me.

sanctioned in high school athletics, the javelin 
is usually dominated by upperclassmen. Howe 
shattered this mold a year ago when he burst on 
the scene as a freshman to win the CCAA title 
and earn CCAA Freshman of the Y ear honors. 
But it was during his sophomore season that 
Howe developed into a top athlete, progressing 
at a rate that exceeded everyone’s expectations 
— in less than one year, he furthered his best 
throw by close to 25 feet. On May 29, Howe 
took home a national title, throwing 225 feet at 
the championship meet in Charlotte, N.C., to 
become UCSD’s first male track and field cham-
pion at the Division-II level.

COMPILED BY LIAM ROSE, VISHAL NATARAJAN, AND MATT CROSKEYWHATEVER THE SECRET TO
hitting may be, Gregorich certainly found it this year. 
With new school records in hits, doubles and RBIs in 
a season, the senior first baseman undoubtedly had 
one of the best seasons in UCSD baseball history all 
while hitting a ridiculously high .455 average. His 
awards are too numerous to list in full: CCAA Player 
of the Y ear, Daktronics West Region Player of the Y ear 
and ABCA/Rawlings All-American are only some of 
the highlights of his trophy case. Gregorich’s success 
at the plate helped drive the Tritons all the way to the 
Division-II championship game, where they narrowly 
lost to Southern Indiana University. Nonetheless, 
Gregorich’s performance this season will go down in 
the Tritons’ history books as one of the best UCSD 
has ever seen.

WITH HER ABILITY TO SCORE
from anywhere when her team most needed it, 
Carlisle set herself apart as the Tritons’ leader on the 
floor. The sophomore guard guided the Tritons to a 
25-5 season and a second consecutive CCAA title, 
picking up the CCAA Most Valuable Player Award 
along the way. Carlisle averaged a team-high 17.4 
points per game, and also led the Tritons in assists 
and steals. Her efforts led to her being named as a first 
team All-American — the only underclassman named 
to the squad — as well as the Daktronics West Region 
Player of the Y ear. Carlisle surely has many more stel-
lar games left in her career, but her consistent perfor-

in the pool, his collection of national championships 
do the most to say he’s one of the best athletes to ever 
represent UCSD. He won his first titles as a sopho-

in both events. He became champion in the 100 free 
for three straight years, and his winning 100-yard 
freestyle time of 43.30 seconds in 2009 still stands as 
an NCAA Division-II record. It doesn’t end there — 
he has been featured in Sports Illustrated magazine’s 
“Faces in the Crowd” segment, met the qualifying 
standards for U.S. Olympic Trials and finished his 
career holding school records in four separate events. 
With five national titles in his career, Perdew gradu-

DURING THE SECOND GAME OF
the Division-II College World Series in Cary, N.C., 
Rossman got the starting nod and did not disappoint. 
Rossman kept a no-hitter through the eighth inning, 
but allowed two straight doubles that let Mules tie 
the game 1-1. The game moved on to extra innings, 
but the Triton bullpen stayed empty, and Rossman 
settled down to continue his pitching dominance. 
Rossman did not allow a single hit for the rest of the 
game, which finally ended thanks to an RBI single 
from Kellen Lee. The senior righty finished the day 
with an 11-inning complete game, allowing only two 
hits and striking out 12 batters. A complete game is 
hard enough, but for a pitcher to pitch 11 dominant 
innings is unheard of. In his last start as a Triton, 
Rossman’s outing against Central Missouri set the 
standard for playoff performances.

UCSD BASEBALL MAY HAVE COME JUST SHORT OF A
national title, but its season was far from a disappointment. In fact, it was the most 
successful run to date, and it’s hard to argue that this team was anything but one of 
the nation’s best: 54 wins, only eight losses and just two runs short of a national title. 
The Tritons never dropped below fourth in the national rankings and were the top-
ranked team for the final month of the season. UCSD also raked in the individual 
accolades, with a phenomenal six players named to the All-American team. Senior 
Vance Albitz won third Gold Glove and repeated as National Defensive Player of 
the Y ear, and senior Brandon Gregorich took CCAA Player of the Y ear honors. The 
list goes on, but the message is clear: Baseball was UCSD’s best team this year.

Rainwater had been unable to shake a nagging back injury for several weeks, and by the end of the competition was in so much pain that she needed to be helped off the mat
after each jump. It wasn’t discovered until later that Rainwater was actually competing 
with a fractured back. “If we knew at the time we would have pulled her, ” head coach Tony 
Salerno said. “She said she had some pain but that she could still jump. ” Rainwater man-

IN THE SECOND ROUND OF THE NCAA DIVISION-II TOURNAMENT
on Nov. 14, UCSD hosted Chico State in a battle of conference foes. The Tritons were 
making their seventh appearance in the second round, while it was the Wildcats first 
— yet Chico had beaten UCSD 2-0 when the two first met on 2009 on Sep. 20.  The 
Wildcats came out strong and struck first in the 23rd minute, but the Tritons didn’t wait 
long to equalize. Less than 60 seconds later, sophomore striker Sarah McTigue hit a blis-
tering shot from the top of the box into the top-left corner of the goal, and the game was 
tied at 1-1. The deadlock was finally broken in the 86th minute, when McTigue gathered 
a loose ball on the edge of the box and fired in a hard shot. The ball slipped past the 
goalkeeper, and the Tritons survived a frantic last few minutes for the 2-1 win. The dra-
matic goal provided for UCSD’s most entertaining game this year and sent the Tritons 
into the third round of the tournament.
