Afﬁrmative 
Action Under New Review
By Hayley Bisceglia-Martin
News Editor
Fourteen years after Prop.osition 209 banned 
affirmative action in California in 1996, a pri-
marily student-based coalition called “By Any Means Necessary” is filing a class-action lawsuit — which names Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and UC President Mark Yudof as defendants — to overturn Prop. 209 and reinstate affirmative action in California’s public schools.
The lawsuit, filed on Feb. 16, argues that Prop. 
209 is unconstitutional, as it violates students’ 14th Amendment rights by mandating separate and unequal procedures for minority students. The legal brief states that Prop.. 209 was “specifi-cally intended to decrease or hold down Latina/o, black and Native-American enrollment. ”
“We can’t allow the separate and unequal con-
ditions that are not only continuing in California, but which are legally in place, and legally codi-fied with Prop.osition 209, ” Northern California Coordinator of BAMN Yvette Felarca said. 
If successful, the lawsuit would allow public 
schools — like the University of California — to reinstate affirmative action. It would not, however, guarantee any university action. According to Pi Kappa Alpha and the less publicized frater-nities responsible for 
the “Compton Cookout” are breathing a deep sigh of relief right now, because — just in the nick of time — the Koala 
has dependably swooped in to steal the spotlight.
All anger directed toward 
the Feb. 15 Black History Month-mocking frat party was quickly shifted to the campus humor newspaper everyone loves to hate on Thursday night, when Koala  Editor in 
Chief Kris Gregorian droppedBy Angela Chen
News Editor
Two words aired on 
Student-Run Television Thursday night brought UCSD into the national spotlight — and into yet another campus free-speech debate. After Kris Gregorian, editor in chief  of humor newspaper the Koala,  said that protestors 
of last week’s controversial “Compton Cookout” party were “ungrateful niggers” on Channel 18, the Black Student Union declared a “State of Emergency” and issued a six-page list of demands to the university.
In response to the out-
rage — expressed principal-ly by the black population at UCSD, or about 1.3 percent of 22,000 undergraduates — A.S. President Utsav Gupta immediately shut down SRTV . Then, on Friday afternoon, he unexpectedly decided to freeze all student fees toward media organiza-tions.
Party Foul
The Feb. 15 Cookout 
was a racially themed 
fraternity party widely con-demned by the BSU and the Student Affirmative Action Committee, along with Chancellor Marye Anne Fox and Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny Rue. 
According to ABC 10 
News, the party was held at the home of Pi Kappa Alpha member Elliot Van Nostrand, who was also responsible for creating the ▶  .7+=;▶  -,1<7:1)4+IUX][:MIK\[\W:IKQIT;T]Z

A punk-hop P .O.S. 
concert at the Loft on Feb. 20 was opened by Minne-apolis-based rapper Dessa with soulful spoken word. Dessa was followed by MC Grieves on the mic, backed by Budo on the turntables. When P .O.S. took the stage around 11 p.m., Grieves and Dessa came back out to perform the track “Low Light Low Life.”

Associate Vice President of A.S. Concerts and Events Alex Bramwell announced plans to fund daytime events at each of UCSD’s six colleges at an open forum held on Feb. 18. 
According to Eleanor Roosevelt 
College Council President Brandon Chirco, although the A.S. Council has been working with the college councils since Fall Quarter, details of the col-laboration are still being ironed out.
“It has been brought up to our coun-

POORLY DRAWN LINES By Reza Farazmand

By Megha Ram
Staff Writer
After identifying the location of 
stem-cell production in the blood 
vessels of zebrafish, biologists at UCSD hope to one day use the infor-mation to simplify human medical procedures like bone-marrow trans-plants.
In the future, scientists will ide-
ally be able stimulate the growth of a sick patient’s own stem cells, then re-direct them to the area where they are needed — such as the bone mar-row. This would greatly decrease the chances of infection or graft-versus-host disease, in which the donor cells reject or attack the body.
The research team that discov-
ered the location was headed by assistant professor of biology David Traver, postdoctoral fellow in Traver’s laboratory Julien Bertrand, assistant professor of medicine Neil Chi and professor of biochemistry at UC San Francisco Didier Stainier. Bertrand 
said he thought zebrafish might be good cell providers because they have proven to be a standard test model for other vertebrates, including humans. The zebrafish embryo is also more accessible in its developmental stages than the traditional lab rat.
 “[The formation of blood cells] 
has been thoroughly described in the mouse embryo, but since mouse development occurs in utero, it is not accessible for direct imaging, ” Bertrand said. “Zebrafish develop-ment — on the other hand — occurs in a petri dish, because fertilization is external in fish. ” 
The cells — more specifically 
known as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) — have the ability to gener-ate many types of cells. These include white blood cells, which affect the immune system, and red blood cells like platelets, which help in clotting.
 According to Bertrand, this dis-
covery is an important step toward 
understanding how to produce HSCs from types of artificial stem cells that are either more readily available or more limited. These HSCs would then have the potential to create any cell the body might need.
“[Through imaging,] I could 
observe the ‘transformation’ of flat endothelial cells along the aorta into round [bone-marrow] stem cells, ” Bertrand said. 
Now that scientists have identified 
the area where HSCs are produced, they can begin trying to produce them independently of a donor. Patients with blood or bone-marrow diseases — like cancer or leukemia — would undergo a transplant with HSCs that are already compatible with their immune systems.
 Because the zebrafish embryo is 
transparent, biologists easily observed and studied the growth of the fish as they developed in their eggs.

highly criticized Facebook event. 
(The PIKE active roster has been 
removed from the fraternity’s Web 
site. Robby Naoufal, president of the Inter-Fraternity Council, said he had no access to fraternity rosters.)
To complicate the matter further, a 
Y outube video has surfaced featuring black Internet personality Jiggaboo Jones, in which he claims the party was a promotional event for his DVD release. The video is widely linked in comments on news stories and forums — used to prove party planners weren’t being racist.
Jones confirmed he was affiliated 
with the party. 
“I am very upset that they would 
pick out my fans to try to get back at me and to start this madness, ” he said. 
Though IFC adviser Emily 
Feinstein stated the incident was neither funded nor sponsored by any fraternity, PIKE has received much of the blame. An anony-mous member of PIKE said the fraternity is planning to sue the university for slander. Both Naoufal and Campuswide Senator Tobias Haglund, a member of PIKE, said they were unaware of this plan. 
Neither PIKE president Garron 
Engstrom nor Van Nostrand could be reached for comment. 
The N-Word
After an impromptu Campus 
Black Forum was held Tuesday night 
and administrators instated the “Racism: Not In Our Community” campaign, Thursday night’s SRTV broadcast revived campus upset.
At 7:30 p.m., the station aired a 
segment in which Muir College junior Y elena Akopian interviewed three stu-dents who planned to throw a similar “Black History Month” party. The stu-dents went on air complaining about the protests and defending their party as protected by the First Amendment.
According to SRTV manager-in-training Panham Morini, this broad-cast inspired Gregorian to comment on the Cookout during the Koala ’s 
regular 10 p.m. show.
“ After the initial three guys left, the 
Koala  made the topic Black History 
Month, and they started doing a show that was normal for Koala TV stan-dards, ” Morini said.
Over the course of the show, Koala  
members made controversial com-ments, linking HIV to sexuality and race, and attacking black protesters of the Cookout.
“The material was not too differ-
ent from typical Koala  fodder, ” Morini 
said. “But the timing for these state-ments was definitely off. ”
According to assistant professor of 
ethnic studies Sarah Clarke Kaplan, students returning from a second Campus Black Forum — which included dialogue with PIKE repre-sentatives — were heckled by Koala  
members who wanted them to appear on the show. Gregorian denied these allegations. 
After the students declined to 
participte, they returned to their resi-dences and began to watch Koala TV .  Shocked by the content, they alerted A.S. Campuswide Senator Bryant Pena to the broadcast,  who then noti-fied A.S. President Gupta. 
According to Gupta, he immedi-
ately called station manager Thomas Dadourian — who was downstairs at Porter’s Pub filming a live perfor-mance — and asked him to inter-vene. Dadourian said he returned to the studio and changed the subject of the show, although he thought it unwise to go off air mid-feed. 
“I just went on camera and got 
them to change the subject with-out [them] knowing that they’ll be censored, ” he said. “So I got them to stop, but by then it was already too late. ”
Over text message and e-mail, 
members of the BSU mobilized Thursday night, and began writing a press release with demands.
The next morning, Feb. 19, the 
BSU released a six-page statement declaring the campus environment to be “toxic, ” and issued a list of 32 demands. These include the creation of a “safe space” for black students on campus, a permanent task force to fund outreach efforts, funds to match those of S.P .A.C.E.S. and O.A.S.I.S. and implementation of holistic-review admissions by 2011 — a system that takes into account a candidate’s entire application instead of assign-ing specific point values, like the Comprehensive Review system UCSD currently uses. 
In response to the Koala TV 
broadcast, the BSU held a protest at 8 a.m. the next morning on Library Walk. Approximately 200 people dressed in black marched to the A.S. Forum in Price Center, where they held a two-hour conference with the entire university cabinet. Students called for awareness of their actions on campus, and for the chancellor to meet the BSU demands.
During the conference, BSU 
members went to the SRTV station to search for a copy of the tape, to no avail. However, they did find a piece of cardboard on the floor with the words “Compton Lynching” written on it. The note has since been turned over to police as “evidence. ”
According to Sixth College fresh-
man Thieny Nguyen, the only avail-able recording of the show was made by BSU Vice Chair Fnann Keflezighi’s on her cell phone. 
Both Vice Chancellor Penny Rue 
and BSU member Grant White, a Marshall College freshman, said that Fox read each of the BSU’s demands out loud, agreeing to meet many of them instantly — like providing increased funding for the African-American studies minor and ethnic studies programs.

a drunken “ungrateful niggers” bomb 
on what had to be the greatest viewer-ship Channel 18 has seen since Koala TV’s pornographic glory days. It was a terrible judgment call, made all the more cruel by its timing. The Black Student Union was fresh out of a Campus Black Forum and watching, waiting for an inevitable battle cry from the Koala camp.
Later that night, A.S. President 
Utsav Gupta shut down the recently revamped Student-Run Television (which he claims he didn’t know was airing Koala TV , though it’s the chan-nel’s most consistent programming) in response. BSU Chairpersons David Ritcherson and Fnann Keflezighi declared UCSD’s campus climate was in a “State of Emergency” by 7:30 a.m. the next morning.
The back-and-forth was to be 
expected, but then Gupta took an unforeseen leap: He froze funding for all 33 student publications. “In any game where the players are getting hurt, you hit the pause button, ” he said. Translation: If things start get-ting heated, you duct-tape the mouths of all those who might cause more trouble within your kingdom.
Though he has made it clear the 
A.S. Council is indeed doing every-thing it can to legally defund the Koala , his taboo Friday-morning deci-
sion was not a last-minute attempt to crush UCSD’s most controversial rag — which can be counted on to bal-loon the Cookout controversy to epic proportions. Anybody with a scrap of institutional memory knows the Koala  
will go to print, even if members have to write the issue in their own feces on spools of toilet paper. In fact, they’ d probably love that.
No, Gupta’s freeze is obviously a 
lesson — one that contradicted his self-proclaimed undying commit-ment to enabling free student press. Outraged Black Student Unioners are demanding their fees not fund Koala  
hate speech, so Gupta feels he has to demonstrate the widespread conse-quences of making that dream come true — seeing as, by law, the A.S. Council cannot choose to defund cer-tain publications based on content.
What we’ve learned: Gupta val-
ues dictatorial, learn-the-hard-way parenting over the unconditional preservation of free speech (or at least open dialogue) at UCSD, and is unfortunately equipped with absolute power over the A.S. budget. Sure, he has promised the media-org funding freeze will only last a week or two, depending on the progress made at a public committee meeting this Thursday or Friday. (Vice President of Finances Peter Benesch and Associate Vice President of Student Organizations Andrew Ang, a known adversary of the Koala , predict it will, 
in fact, last into Spring Quarter.) But considering forum attendees will take the form of both enraged BSU mem-bers and First Amendment warriors like the Koala , it’s safe to say there’s lit-
tle chance for peaceful understanding or resolution. Only destined to add more fuel to the fire is Gupta’s posses-sive attitude: “I can ask at any time for anyone to leave the room, ” he said.
Ironically, the freeze pretty much 
guarantees that Koala  commentary 
will be the only physical media avail-able during the next week of turmoil, as orgs without the same blood-thirsty penchant to claw at open wounds aren’t so likely to spill sweat 
▶ MEDIA, MYVTWHNL
See PUBLICATIONS page 5A Sunday morning walk across campus doesn’t offer much in the way of visual stimula-
tion. Both bedheaded and dismayed by the fact that there’s still nowhere on campus to get decent coffee at 11 a.m., I’m not typically very aware of 
my surroundings before that obliga-
tory second cup, nor in any place to make observations more insightful than “Shit, I knew  it was a bad idea 
to wear suede. ”
Today was a little different. 
Passing through Muir College, I saw something to force me out of my mid-morning haze — something so uncommon here that I had little choice but to stop and wipe the sleep out of my eyes to be sure that what appeared before me was not a mere hallucination or sleep-deprived mirage: graffiti. 
The mere sight of the tagged 
building was almost startling enough to make me wonder if I was still on our campus, and not in an alter-nate universe in which students get angry enough to deface school property and coffee shops are open on weekend mornings. The text itself was equally striking: The first bit read “No Justice, No Peace” in red lettering, and the other end of the building read: “Know Justice, Know Peace” in blue.  
At a time when both justice and 
peace have come into question on campus, the writing relayed a simple message — a call to action, really — that, displayed brazenly in one of the most trafficked areas on campus, is also impossible to ignore. Though I’m not usually the biggest fan of campus graffiti outside the infamous hipster confines of the Mandeville Center stairwell, the lit major inside me had to admit: It’s powerful phras-ing.

Dear Editor,
We submit that the so-called 
“Compton Cookout” incident has less to do with the racist culture of a par-ticular fraternity or the Greek system in general (although that is certainly a factor) than it does with long-stand-ing structural problems at UCSD — 
lack of a critical mass of faculty and 
students of color, generic (specific, community-neutral) approaches to improving campus climate, a very low profile and poorly funded African-American and Chicano studies cur-ricular programs, etc. Together all of these institutional weaknesses pro-duce a campus climate that embold-
ens the kind of racism we saw in the 
language and proposed activities of the “Compton Cookout. ”
We urge the administration to 
avoid psychological interpretations of the incident. Individual behavior and attitudes are not the primary source of the problem. It will not be enough to oppose racist speech with “more speech, ” with lessons about the limits of satire or even with well intentioned but ultimately symbolic campaigns such as the proposed “Not in Our Community” initiative.
This incident, and the potential for 
others in the future, should convince campus policymakers that serious structural changes are long overdue. In our opinion, the administration should take immediate action and 1) commit to permanent and substantial 
funding and staffing for the African 
American Studies Minor, 2) establish an Organized Research Unit to con-duct research on local communities of color that are underrepresented at UCSD, 3) create a task force to study the desirability of rotating public art installations linked to underrepresent-ed minority communities (preferably local) and 4) reorganize the office of 
the Chief Diversity Officer in order to 
facilitate the writing of a campuswide plan for addressing campus climate with a focus on how climate affects specific groups. 
We understand that in a time 
of budgetary constraints, some of these proposed solutions will be dif-ficult to implement. And yet these kinds of changes ought to receive the highest priority if we are to believe Chancellor Marye Anne Fox when she says the campus has a serious commitment to diversity. What is undeniable is that UCSD must change what it has been doing on the diversity front up until now. It’s sim-ply not working.

Dear Editor,
The university was right to con-
demn the “Compton Cookout” party. It was both insulting to the African-American community, and degrading to UCSD’s image. But the adminis-tration’s response to this racist off-
campus event ignores one of UCSD’s most embarrassing, racist, on-campus 
publications: the Koala .
The Koala , notorious for its 
humorless and unintelligent satire, takes every opportunity to insult minorities of every race, religion and orientation. Though their offensive rants are largely unread and ignored, I must ask: Why there is a lack of out-rage on behalf of the administration 
or the Black Student Union regarding 
the material published in the Koala ?
The Koala  receives its funding 
from the university through the Associated Students. On Feb. 15, the Koala  submitted yet another fund-
ing request to the A.S. Council. They declared themselves a publication, type: “Tabloid, not offensive, ” and asked for no less than $3,471.15 (All 
of this information can be found on 
the A.S. Web site). Where does this money come from? Tuition? Student fees? Who knows. Could this money be better spent? Absolutely.
It is hypocritical for the university 
to come down so strongly against the unaffiliated cookout, while simulta-neously ignoring the racism spewed by the Koala , which is funded by the 
A.S. Council. The administration and the Black Student Union should regularly come down on the Koala , as 
they did in response to the cookout. Finally, Associated Students needs to cut funding to the Koala . At the 
very least, it can do this by citing the erroneous description of “Tabloid, not offensive” on the Koala  funding 
request form.

Just as I finished out my trek to 
the Student Center, though, I found 
another tag. This one, scrawled onto the doors of the elevator, in the same red spray paint, read: “No 32%” (i.e., “Don’t raise our student fees by 32 percent”). It was next to a spray-painted advertisement for our on-campus protest on March 4.
My immediate reaction — “Y es, 
32 percent: That’s how much more we’re paying. ” — might have been cynical. But of all the things to pro-test on this campus — racist frat parties, dramatically reduced course offerings, the recent funding freeze for student media — a fee hike for which we’ve already begun to pay (and that the UC Regents approved three months ago) sits pretty low on the rank of feasible targets for cur-rent reform. 
Of course, I’m not saying that 
we should hang our heads in defeat and leave it at that. But expressing misguided anger with a can of spray paint on an elevator door doesn’t accomplish anything beyond serv-ing as a perpetual reminder that yes, actually, tuition is skyrocketing — or 
if not perpetual, at least until one of the same underpaid UC workers whose rights protesters advocate is tasked with cleaning it off. For all the cans of spray paint we empty for the cause, until we’ve got a stabler stream of funding from the state, our ever-swelling list of TritonLink fees won’t be slowing down anytime soon.
Assuming that what results on 
March 4 isn’t merely a pissed-off band of student rebels who know little about areas of remaining potential for change, there’s plenty of opportunity to show the governor and the regents alike that we’re a force to be reckoned with — but we can’t very well expect to be taken seriously if we’re spouting the same old complaints. For a bit of educa-tion, attend the teach-in today, Feb. 22, in Social Sciences Building 107 at 12 p.m. with guest speaker Bob Samuels, President of the UC American Federation of Teachers.  and tears over finding advertisers, especially in time to print relevant material. It’s another willing sacri-fice by Gupta in a game of Daddy-knows-best politics. (For instance, an informative and refreshing article on the California Review ’s Web site will 
unfortunately receive a fraction of the readership it would if passed out on Library Walk.)
Because Gupta is aware it’s near 
impossible to seek immediate alterna-tive funds, he therefore must be aware he is essentially censoring all existing publications. The freeze will likewise discourage the production of any new media from members of the BSU, or any other students in opposition to the Cookout and/or the Koala . 
If there’s one thing the American 
Civil Liberties Union and Vice Chancellor of Student Life Penny Rue (not to mention any good therapist) can agree on, it’s that more speech — not less — is most beneficial to a hurt-ing community.
So Gupta obviously went about 
this in the worst way possible. But what he’s trying to show us is valuable: Is it really worth winning back the few dollars we spend on media-org operations we don’t agree with, when the price is sucking the campus dry of all written discussion, and endanger-ing an environment in which students can express themselves freely? Not to mention, if the freeze were to hold, we wouldn’t necessarily see those dol-lars back; it’s not like the A.S. Council would run a reverse referendum to lower student fees in accordance with the absence of media orgs on the budget. For all we know, that money might just melt into the giant Sun God pot-o’-funds.
The Koala  receives about $7,000 
per year for printing. That’s about 30 cents per student. In total, media orgs will receive $53,000 in 2009-10. If this is actually about our fees, let’s consider where else they’re going. Non-media orgs will receive $440,000. On top of that, “tradition events” — long-standing org fixtures — will receive $105,000. KSDT Radio will receive $11,000. Six beer gardens will cost over $90,000. The Sun God Festival will receive $550,000 — part of which may be sucked up by increased secu-rity. Perhaps, being a newspaper, we’re biased, but we feel journalism on cam-pus is worth at least one-tenth of Sun God — even if that includes the kind that offends us.
Students should be equally wor-
ried if the A.S. Council — no doubt guided by whispers from the Campus Council — does find a way to cut only the Koala ’s funds, or require all media 
content to be pre-approved, as has been suggested. The Koala may be an 
unpopular extreme, but depending on the council, the censorship threshold could fluctuate to include whatever they find unacceptable at the time. 
Isn’t it clear by now that the Koala  
makes fun of everybody? And the more we get our panties in a twist, the nastier they’re likely to fight. Content is often in poor taste, but it ensures the rest of us continue to say what we want. Let’s instead focus on forming a stronger opposing army: Ethnic-studies departments and tutoring services need to be built back up, out-reach efforts need more helping hands and there’s always room for more media orgs with minority viewpoints (assuming we survive the freeze). Heck, there’s even an affirmative-action march on Sacramento as we speak, ripe for the joining.
“This is probably the decision I’m 
going to be remembered by, ” Gupta admitted. Hell yeah, it is. He just lost 34 voices of support across campus. Granted, he made the decision so students will understand the potential consequences of their angry requests — but that’s not worth this moment of silence, and neither is the jolting prec-edent it sets: casually cork the student voice when things get too noisy.

6 THE UCSD GUARDIAN  MONDAY , FEBRUARY 22, 2010  OPINION
In an interview with Parade maga-
zine last week, Elton John — ’70s 
pop icon with a flair for sequins, sunglasses and all things flamboy-ant, in case you live under a rock — ruffled the feathers of Christian leadership with a bold statement. 
“I think Jesus was a compassion-
ate, super-intelligent gay man, ” he said.
Naturally, superimposing gay-
ness on an individual from whom millions of people derive their religious identity has gotten John into quite a mess. But by insisting on Jesus’ homosexuality, John had to have known he was fanning the flames of controversy — and so he got his wish. 
Think about it: While twenty- 
and thirtysomething celebrities fad-ing from pop-culture relevance have the luxury of sex tapes and paparaz-zi crotch shots at their disposal, an older icon such as John has but one avenue to grabbing headlines (other than death): spouting off irrelevant opinions on contentious issues.
Or, in this case, creating one all 
his own. 
And while 
John’s homo-Jesus beliefs haven’t won him much right-wing Christian sup-port, it’s a small price to pay for all the free Internet press he’s snagged along the way.   
—Trevor Cox
Opinion EditorThough gay Jesus accusations may have netted Elton John a load of 
press, it’s certainly not his first time.  
“Instead of more violence, why 
isn’t there a meeting of religious lead-ers?” John said in a 2006 interview with Music Monthly Magazine. “We are all God’s people; we have to get along and the religious leaders have to lead the way. ”
But even if he really just wants 
peace and love, John’s done a thor-ough job of pissing off Christian lead-ers. He’s been an especially easy target for outraged bloggers, mocking him and citing verses from Leviticus in condemnation of homosexuality. “He should not speak on things he knows nothing about. Elton John’s lifestyle speaks for itself, ” one poster wrote on a Fox News blog. 
It’s clear not everyone appreci-
ates John’s religious views (or power ballads), but many of the statements made in opposition to his latest athe-istic horn-blow reveal that much of the Christian community is still — surprise, surprise — unwilling to just get along. So, regardless to what he 
thinks about Jesus’ sexual preferences, if it’s really religious unity and peace John is after, alienating the Christian community isn’t the wisest place to start.

YUIKO  SUGINO /GUARDIANNEWS MONDAY , FEBRUARY 22, 2010  THE UCSD GUARDIAN 7 
Steve Montiel, a spokesman for the 
University of California Office of the President, it is too early in the lawsuit to reopen the discussion of affirmative action. He said the university will con-sider reinstating affirmative action in the future, if the lawsuit is successful. 
“If this opens up another discus-
sion, that’s well and good, but as long as Prop.osition 209 is the law, we’re obliged to follow it, ” Montiel said.
According to Ronald Cruz, a 
prosecuting lawyer with Scheff, Washington & Driver, P .C., the poli-cies put in place by Prop.. 209 lead to segregated universities.
“The experience of California 
has proven that this is just an unten-able social policy, because one of the results is that the UC system — after trying everything, including con-sidering socioeconomic class — has not increased the number of black, Latino or Native-American students in the campuses, ” Cruz said. “ And at many UC campuses, there is a permanent de facto segregation as a direct result of Prop.osition 209. ”
Opponents of affirmative action 
have argued that standardized tests like the SAT, alongside GPAs, pro-vide an even playing field by which colleges can judge all applications. Felarca also said that opponents of affirmative action often believe that if students are accepted to a univer-sity based on a combination of race and academic achievement, they may be less equipped to handle their cho-sen college’s curriculum.
According to Felarca, these argu-
ments are unjustified, and perpetuate low representation of minorities at California’s public universities.
“The criteria that opponents of 
affirmative action try to use to justify the exclusion of black and Latino and Native-Americans — and also poor students of all races — are completely biased and racist, ” Felarca said. “[The SAT exams] are not accurate mea-sures or objective measures of their intelligence. And, of course, grade-point averages are so subjective, and so weighted in favor of students who have had more access to AP classes and honors classes. And that isn’t the reality of the state of California — that all students have equal access. ”
According to Cruz, the legal climate 
has changed significantly in BAMN’s 
favor since Prop. 209 passed in 1996. The 2003 Supreme Court case Grutter 
v. Bollinger  declared on a federal level 
that affirmative action was not only legal, but also necessary to reverse racial injustices. This set a clear prec-edent, Cruz said, in favor of affirmative action, though the decision did not mandate that states adopt the policy.
“The Supreme Court said that 
these measures are completely con-stitutional and, on top of that, serve a national interest, ” Cruz said. 
In addition, the strength of the 
new student movement that protest-ed the 32-percent fee hikes helped convince BAMN that now was the time to file this lawsuit, Felarca said.
“The student movement that has 
been built on the campuses — espe-cially in the past semester, around defending public education, and higher education, and against the fee hikes and budget cuts — has com-pletely strengthened the possibilities of winning, ” Felarca said. “In the end, this lawsuit is an extension of that movement. ”

In 2009, A.S. Concerts and Events 
put on “nooner concerts” — midday 
performances by less-popular open-ing bands in Price Center — and other activities throughout campus during the week leading up to the Sun God Festival. However, on the actual day of the festival, all council-funded events and programming took place on RIMAC Field. 
According to Bramwell, the A.S. 
Council hopes that allocating a small fraction of its $550,000 Sun-God budget to the individual colleges may help spread the Sun God Festival to other parts of the campus.
“We are really trying to focus 
on the event itself on RIMAC Field, but there will be other A.S.-endorsed events, like the Junkyard Derby, which we are excited about, ” Bramwell said at the open forum. “There are also going to be college-specific events that A.S. has agreed to subsidize, but not necessarily have their hands in programming. ”
Chirco said the “uncaging” could 
have a positive impact on the festival.
“Honestly, I think it’s a good idea, ” 
he said. “I’ d like to see more college-council participation. Obviously, it’s going to need a lot of refinements. It’s 
the first year since Sun God has been caged that it’s going to be uncaged, so we’re taking baby steps. ”
Bramwell also discussed effective 
wristband distribution methods, in response to student upset over long lines in 2009. Although no final deci-sion has been made on the matter, Bramwell proposed that half of the roughly 16,500 student wristbands be handed out on the Thursday after-noon before the event, and the rest be distributed on the morning of the festival.

SRTV SHUTDOWN
Gupta responded to the offensive broadcast by imme-
diately revoking SRTV’s charter at 11:30 p.m. on Thursday night. 
The station has a turbulent history — especially where the 
Koala  is concerned. In 2005, it was shut down after former 
Koala editor in chief Steve Y ork aired a recording of himself 
having sex with an adult-film actress, garnering national media attention and prompting a heated debate over free speech. 
Since its most recent relaunch earlier this quarter, SRTV 
has aired 10 episodes of the show “Will It Chop, ” as well as “Cooking With Dr. D, ” “Beatendo, ” “Home Suite Home” 
and “DVC Fridays, ” along with a single airing of “Gupta 
Answers. ” Between broadcasts, the station loops five 
hours of old content — such as past FallFests and 
concerts — and had planned to start streaming 
online by Spring Quarter.
Gupta said that SRTV’s charter has 
been revoked indefinitely. The station’s 
future will be discussed at a public 
committee meeting set for later 
this week  — the same one that 
will discuss the future of media 
organizations on campus, and 
rewrite guidelines for appro-
priate use of A.S. Council fis-
cal allocations.
“The committee is [a] 
good tool for us to work out 
and work with the student 
body on what they like to see 
done with their student fees, ” 
Gupta said.  
He stressed that the station was not 
shut down solely due to Thursday night’s 
content, but also because Koala TV had 
not completed the necessary paperwork to 
broadcast on the station  — which gave him the 
authority to revoke the station’s charter imme-
diately.
“The fact that the content was so intolerant and 
insensitive prompted us to review how it was on SRTV 
in the first place, ” he said.  
Under SRTV’s new charter, any group wishing to 
broadcast a program must complete paperwork and receive 
signatures of approval from both station managers: Dadourian and Ali Haidan. The Koala  did not have Haidan’s signature.
“Basically, their show is illegitimate, which is another rea-
son why SRTV was shut down, because they lied about that, ” Dadourian said.
Dadourian said that he and Haidan were in charge of the 
paperwork, but had been unable to regulate it carefully due to busy schedules. He added that he had trusted the Koala  
because members of the publication had been extremely help-
ful in helping SRTV relaunch.“ Another reason why I took Koala  in such good faith is 
they basically rewired the studio for us, ” he said. “I don’t think 
SRTV would’ve been in function had Kris Gregorian not rewired the entire studio. The efficiency with which they did it was amazing and incredible, and we really needed it. And he’s been the best tech person we’ve ever had. ”
Gupta admitted that the rules of the charter were unclear. 
In fact, his own show, “Gupta Answers, ” broached it as well.
According to Dadourian, there is technically nothing in the 
standing rules that prevents racially charged content. 
“When it comes to things like racial issues, there’s kind of a 
gray line there, ” he said. “ After 10 o’ clock ... if HBO would show it, that means it’s OK. It’s hard to judge when it’s a good time to shut down a program, especially when it comes to race. ”
Dadourian projected the station will lose its ability to 
broadcast live, which he said is “the most important part of the station. ”
“We’re going to lose all access to live shows  — or if we do 
do live shows, then what will end up happening is there’ll be the late-night shows, ” he said. “We won’t be able to have people call in or anything like that. [And what’s worse] is that we spent thousands of dollars on equipment to allow us to do this stuff, and it’s all just going to go to waste because we can’t do live shows anymore. ”
Dadourian said the university is concerned with the ramifi-
cations of live programming.
 “The thing with live programming is it can go from a PG 
to a NC-17 in a matter of seconds, and it’s already too late, ” he said.
Gupta said the option of using only prerecorded material 
will be discussed by the public committee — which he said is not meant to be a content review board.  
“I hope the administration doesn’t get involved in any sort 
of content regulation, ” he said. “The purpose of the commit-tee is to review how A.S. reviews funding and how it sponsors programs on our campus TV network, on our student TV . ”
Dadourian said he has since received five death threats 
through the SRTV call-in feature. It is ironic, he added, for students to both call for an end to hate speech on campus and simultaneously issue death threats.
According to Dadourian, the BSU has not responded to his 
invitations to air their opinions on SRTV . Until SRTV reopens, he is posting footage under the Web site www.trtvucsd.com . 
“ As much as I love free speech, my primary goal is to get 
the television station ready to go, ” he said. “There’s good con-tent we produce that is not racially charged and not pushing the envelopes. ... We let [the Koala ] get away with their name, 
but I don’t think Koala TV will ever be airing on SRTV again. ”
BIG FREEZE
In addition to revoking the charter of the newly launched 
SRTV , Gupta has used his executive powers to freeze all student-media funding, pending discussion by the campus committee this Thursday or Friday (he is currently trying to reserve a room). This quarter, 14 media organizations have requested funding from the council. Gregorian submitted a funding request of $3,471.15 from the council in order to  fund the Koala’ s publishing costs.  
Gupta said he implemented the funding freeze in order 
to bring media organizations and protestors together at the meeting — to create a campuswide dialogue about free speech, student fees and funding. 
“When the players of a game start to get hurt, you need to 
press pause, ” he said.
According to A.S. Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Peter Benesch, this freeze on student funding will last until the campuswide committee can decide on new language and criteria for the funding of student media orga-nizations. 
Benesch said that the freeze was not a new idea caused 
by the SRTV incident, but had long been discussed by the council.
“We had been considering this before, ” he said. “There’s 
always been the problem that A.S. is using student fees to fund what many consider hate speech. ”
Benesch said the council is seeking legal counsel on how 
to define hate speech. He gave the example of the California 
Review  — a conservative campus newspaper that recently 
published a cartoon depicting a Muslim “underwear bomber” — as a publication some have called hateful.
“The criteria for hate speech is tricky, and that’s one of the 
things the campuswide committee hopes to address, ” he said. “We want to make absolutely sure that we are not funding hate speech. ”
California Review  Editor in Chief Alec Weisman  said his 
paper — which is entirely funded by the A.S. Council — will feel a strong impact from this freeze, and that it will hinder the paper’s production process.
“This will create a large damper on productivity, ” 
Weisman said. “We were planning on distributing an issue during ninth week, but it looks like that won’t happen. ”
Weisman said that if the freeze continues, the paper might 
be forced to move online or seek funding from external sources. 
“ A.S. is definitely overreacting, ” he said. “This is getting 
out of hand, and they’re looking for an excuse to shut down free speech, which the school has tried to do for years. The school is taking it to extremes. ”
Gupta said that if the committee decides to change media 
guidelines, he will put a referendum up for vote on the Spring Quarter election ballot.
“I don’t think this is a decision that should just go 
through A.S., ” he said. “If students recommend these chang-es, I want the student body to be able to decide on it as well. ”
However, Gupta said he hopes the committee will address 
the funding freeze at the first meeting, so that media orga-nizations can have their funding reinstated as soon as pos-sible — and then continue to discuss policy change at greater length.
Rose Eveleth, editor in chief of Mania Magazine, said 
“mass censorship” is the wrong way to deal with hate speech. She said she is seeking counsel from the Student Press Law Center as to the media organization’s legal options. 
“I understand the pressure that Utsav is under since he 
can’t legally cut off the Koala , but this freeze is definitely 
not the answer, ” Eveleth said.“Many of us were planning to express our outrage over this incidence, and now we can’t even do that. This is detrimental, to not let student express themselves, especially since we have a diverse array of view-points that are being suppressed. ”
Although Gupta said he hopes to reverse the funding 
freeze by the end of the week, Eveleth said Associate Vice President of Student Organizations Andrew Ang told her it’s likely the issue won’t be settled until Spring Quarter.
“I’m not one to have faith about the power of committees 
in this case, ” Eveleth said. “When there’s a lot of angry people getting together to talk about something, good decisions don’t get made. It’s going to turn into a yelling match. ”
Benesch responded to allegations that the A.S. Council is 
shutting down free speech.By Angela Chen

“This is not an issue of ‘punish-
ing’ media organizations, although 
we realize that this moratorium will be difficult for them, ” he said. “This is just a realization that we need to take steps before we continue to fund them. ”Eveleth said she will be work-
ing to secure alternative funding for Mania Magazine as long as the freeze remains.
CRUEL INTENTIONS?
According to Gregorian, the 
comments he made on SRTV were intended to provoke more discussion on the issue. 
“Sure, what I said taken out of 
context may be seen as horrible, ” he said. “But you have to understand that it’s in the context of trying to raise the debate, trying to raise awareness. Right now, there’s only one side of the issue — it’s just BSU yelling at us. There is another side of the issue, which is that everyone is overreacting. ”
In another act of opposition, 
Sixth College senior Mike Randazzo is hosting a “Compton Cookout Part Deux: Equal Rights” party on March 4. He is requesting that guests come dressed as their favorite stereotype, which he said will promote free speech and show that the inten-tions of the original Cookout were innocent. Currently, 120 people have RSVPed as attending.
“I created this event to get people 
to understand that the creators meant no ill will, ” Randazzo said. “It’s wrong that people are getting outraged, and I want to help people come together and put an end to the hatred to show that UCSD is not a racist place. ”
Randazzo said he thinks the orig-
inal Cookout crossed a line, but that it raised a cultural, not racial, issue.
“It’s important to make the dis-
tinction that the party was talking about a culture, and not all black people are part of this culture, and the act of bringing stereotypes to life is completely innocuous, ” he said. “People who are part of a culture like this obviously choose to remain part of the culture, because otherwise they would immigrate to another one. ”
Warren College senior Lisa Vilitz, who created a Facebook group called “UCSD Students Outraged That People Are Outraged About the Compton Cookout, ” agreed that the event wasn’t created with racist intentions, and said that the reaction was excessive.  
“People are saying that the people 
who join my group are racist, which is absolutely ridiculous, ” Vilitz said. “Nobody thinks that black people are actually like that — the party was just satirical. I cannot under-stand how people are outraged at the Cookout, and yet they are not pro-testing MTV , Tyler Perry or rap. ”

Vilitz added that the BSU list of 
demands is unwarranted in light of 
state budget and faculty cuts.  
“I think that this is an overreac-
tion, because we live in a society where people passively ignore the real-life violence that we hear about on the news every day, yet when something that may be considered “offensive” occurs, the entire nation is on fire, ” she said. 
MY RIGHTS VS. YOURS 
Faculty members, the BSU and 
even state legislators have publicly condemned both the original event and the comments made on SRTV . 
Associate professer of ethnic stud-
ies Kaplan praised the A.S. Council’s decision to shut down SRTV and freeze media funding.
“My initial thoughts are that — 
first of all — it’s absolutely appalling, ” Kaplan said. “It’s an egregious misuse of campus resources to spread these kinds of deeply insulting and degrad-ing ideas and messages and images. ”
She criticized administrators for 
their initial “tepid” response to the Cookout.
“I think that whether it intended 
to or not, it gave passive permission students to continue to escalate into increasingly violent speech and lan-guage towards African-Americans, ” Kaplan said. “ And that’s exactly what happened. ”
She said the administration’s 
e-mailed responses were more con-cerned with covering campus liability than addressing the larger issue of a negative campus climate.
“I think that the initial response 
was so focused on issues of legality, policy and liability, that it really failed to make clear what I think they’ve made more clear now: the administra-tion’s strong commitment to changing campus climate, and their responsibil-ity for doing so, ” she said. 
She fears that recruiting black stu-
dents to apply and attend UCSD could nonetheless become more difficult, as it now has the association of being a “racist” campus. However, Kaplan applauded the administration’s latest actions in showing themselves to be more committed to fixing the situa-tion — especially with the pilot imple-mentation of holistic review.
“Discourses, ideas, representations 
have the power to wound, are an act of violence in their own right, and they incite physical and material vio-lence, ” Kaplan said.
Literature professor and director 
of Chicano/a and Latino/a studies Jorge Mariscal — alongside Office of Academic Support and Instructional Services Director Patrick Velasquez — called on the administration to provide increased funding and staff-ing for the African-American studies minor (which the Chancellor has since promised) and create an office in which to address campus climate.
Mariscal said that UCSD Chicano 
Concillo had asked the chancellor to establish a task force to improve the campus climate four years ago.
“In 2006, we thought the climate 
was a ticking time bomb with regard to how uncomfortable it makes black and Chicano students feel, ” Mariscal said. “Our request was never followed up on by the administration, and now we have the current crisis. ”
Marshall College freshman and 
BSU member Grant White made an impromptu presentation in his fresh-man Dimensions of Culture class on Friday morning. White said he should not have to listen to hateful comments.
“I’m not saying that they don’t 
have the right to freedom of speech, but where’s my right to be protected from that?” White asked. “I am a student in your class, and I have to sit next to these racist kids. What kind of college is this?”
The events at UCSD have 
received attention from state law-makers. According to Terry Schanz, press secretary to Assemblyman Isadore Hall (D-Compton), Hall is calling for a resolution condemning the actions of the students, an inves-tigation into UCSD fraternities and for the charter of those fraternities to be revoked.
Schanz said that Hall is attempt-
ing to obtain a recording of SRTV’s Thursday-night broadcast.
“We’ d love to get a hold of the 
tape, ” Schanz said. “That’s a game-changer in terms of the actions that we will pursue. ”
COUNCIL RESPONSE
A.S. Campuswide Senator Bryant 
Pena has already chartered an A.S. committee to draft a resolution concerning campus climate. He said the committee would try to inspire leaders to come up with ideas for improving the climate and create a list of demands. Although there has been no official forum created by the committee thus far, Pena said Greek fraternity members have already met with several members of the BSU.
“We don’t want to attack the 
Greek community, and we don’t want to focus on individuals and these incidents of racism, ” Pena said. “This is all just a symptom of a larger disease that has always been present and that we need to fight. ” 
He encouraged people to par-
ticipate in the March 4 Day of Public Education walkout, to protest and fight for equal-access education for all.
ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION
According to Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Penny Rue, both she and Fox met with members of the BSU on Friday to work on outreach efforts.
Rue has charged the Director of 
Student Policy and Judicial Affairs, Tony Valladolid, with leading the investigation of the students who planned the Cookout. The investiga-tive process, which includes inter-views of suspected persons involved, began Tuesday morning.  
Rue said party planners are being 
investigated for potential violations to the Student Code of Conduct. Section 22.16.10.24 defines harassment as the use of gestures or imagery that creates a hostile environment on campus.  
Another potential violation the 
university is investigating is section 22.16.10.15, which condemns unlaw-ful or unauthorized use of any uni-versity property. 
Possible sanctions of these 
breaches range from a letter of cen-sure to expulsion from the univer-sity. However, Rue said the investiga-tion has not yet concluded.

The Tritons went cold from the 
field in the second half, converting only eight of their 23 shots. They fell to 22-3 overall and 17-3 in the California Collegiate Athletic Association. All of UCSD’s losses have come on the road. 
The loss came one night after 
besting San Francisco State in a hard-fought 58-50 victory on Friday. Carlisle led all scorers with 14 points, while senior guard Annette Ilg added 12 points and Hunter followed up with 11 points and nine boards. The Tritons swept the season series with 
San Francisco for the win.

“We have to come out with 
intensity these last two games, ” Lawley said. “We tend to drop off, and we need to step up on the defensive end. ”
The Tritons have two games left 
in the regular season. They play against Sonoma State University on Feb. 24 and against Humboldt State University on Feb. 26. Both games will be held at 7:30 p.m. at RIMAC arena.  UCSD lost at Humboldt State 74-60 and at Sonoma State 78-66 in its meetings with both teams earlier this season.

▶ M. BASKETBALL, MYVTWHNLThe Tritons placed especially well 
in the sprinting events, winning the 
100-meter, 400-meter and 4x100 races. Sophomores Dan Nguyen and Tobi Haswell won the 100-meter and 400-meter races respectively, and were joined by senior Will Dyer and freshman Erik Frost on the winning relay team. 
Sophomore Nick Howe — the 
reigning California Collegiate Athletic Association Freshman of the Y ear — easily won the javelin throw with his mark of 188’10. ”
Even though the meet was 
successful for both squads, Salerno said he still sees room for growth.
“They were pretty nervous, and a lot of it was that the expectations were so high for both the men and women, ” said Salerno. “I think that the athletes that underachieved were just having early season jitters. ”
Salerno said he has high 
expectations for the team this season.
“On the men’s side, it’s to win the 
conference, and that’s going to require beating Chico, ” he said. “For the women, it’s to win our sixth straight conference title. It’s always harder to stay on top than it is to get there.
The Tritons will travel to UC 
Irvine this Saturday to compete in the All-Cal Championships.

singles matches.
Junior Taskeen Bains, who earned 
Penn/CCAA Player of the Week honors on Feb. 8, took control in the first singles match, winning 6-1 and 6-0. Sophomore Katie Mulloy also won 6-1, 6-1 in straight sets. 
After dismantling Sonoma, 
the Tritons traveled to Turlock on Feb. 20 and succeeded in upsetting Stanilaus. 
The match was a true show of the 
team’s ability to come from behind. Down 2-4 in the tie after losing two of three doubles matches, the Tritons aggressively struck back, winning the last three singles matches — with Juniors Cindy Dao and Valerie Tang and sophomore Katie Milloy leading the rally.
Dao and Tang both rebounded to 
win their singles matches after losing in doubles play earlier in the day. 
“We didn’t have a good start in 
doubles, but our coach just moti-vated us to try harder since we are better in singles, ” Tang said. “We both had the desire to win, and since we hadn’t lost in so long, we wanted to keep that record going. ” 
Mulloy’s dramatic triumph at 
No. 5 singles earned the Tritons the victory in a tense three-set match. With the matchup evened at four wins apiece, Mulloy persevered for a third-set victory 6-2, 4-6, 6-3.
The wins to Sonoma and Stanislaus continued the impressive Triton conference winning streak from seasons past, bringing UCSD to 62 straight wins in the CCAA.
“We are focused on getting wins 
and beating teams, ” LaPlante said. “We’re matching the girls up with stronger teams to beat. ”
The Tritons’ last stop was Davis, 
where they played an out-of-confer-ence matchup against the Division-I Aggies. Despite their best efforts, the Tritons lost 0-9.
“This was a wakeup call for us, ” 
Tang said. “We know we are capable of more, and we know what we need 
to get done. ”
After the loss to Davis, LaPlante 
said the Tritons are ready to get ahead on the court in their next two matches against Fresno Pacific University, currently ranked No. 2 in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. UCSD will host the Feb. 26 match. 
“W e know what we need to work 
on, [and] have identified strengths and weaknesses to have more pro-ductive practices, ” LaPlante said.

TRACK & FIELD — The Tritons 
started their season strong at a 
home meet against San Diego State, Cal Poly Pomona, Cal State Dominguez Hills and Clairemont-Mudd-Scripps on Feb. 20. The team claimed victo-ry on both the men and women’s sides of the competition — the men totaled 152 points, and the women 213.
UCSD athletes hit 10 marks 
that were either provisional or automatic qualifying marks for the NCAA Division-II Regional Championships.
“We were pretty scared, ” head 
coach Tony Salerno said. “We were third in the nation last year, but we graduated some and we are redshirting some. We were amazed at how many qualifiers we had for the first meet of the year. ”
S o m e  o f  l a s t  y e a r ’ s  b e s t  
female performers continued to shine, getting the season off  to an encouraging start. Junior Stephanie LeFever had an outstanding day, tying the school 
record in the long jump with her 
mark of 6.06 meters. She also placed second in the 100-meter hurdles, and fifth in the javelin throw. 
Seniors Christine Merrill 
and Linda Rainwater — both defending national champions  — dominated their respective events. Merrill won both the 
400- and 100-meter hurdles, and 
Rainwater placed first in the high jump. Rainwater also finished third in the javelin, fourth in the 100-meter hurdles and ran on the winning 4x400 relay team.
Junior Kelly Fogarty led the 
way for the sprinters, placing first in both the 100-meter dash with a time of 11.92 seconds and the 200-meter dash with a time of 24.78 seconds. Her performance in the 100-meter barely missed beating her own record of 11.85 seconds.
In the throwing events, junior 
Theresa Richards set a personal best in the javelin throw with 
a mark of 136’3” , winning the 
event by nearly 10 feet. Senior Marie Archer easily won the hammer throw and placed third in the discus throw.
On the men’s side, reigning 
conference champion and senior Leon Baham won both the 110- and 400-meter hurdles, and anchored the Tritons’ 4x400 relay 
team. Baham’s time of 53.67 in the 
400-meter hurdles met the NCAA provisional qualifying time. By Wesley Cox

MEN’S BASKETBALL — UCSD 
turned in a solid performance last Feb. 16, beating Cal State East Bay 67-48. They then saw a split road trip over the weekend, losing 61-50 to San Francisco State and beating Cal State Monterey Bay 78-74. 
The Tritons, led by senior guard 
Tyler Acevedo and his season-high 19 points, comfortably defeated the Cal State East Bay by 19 points in RIMAC Arena. Sophomore center Christian Hatch contributed a double-double of his own — 12 points and 10 rebounds — to help lead the Tritons to their sixth conference win of the season. Hatch nailed big free throws throughout the game, hitting eight of 10 from the line. 
Defense was once again key, as 
the Tritons held Cal State East Bay to 28 percent shooting and matched a season-best defensive effort set last week by holding the Pioneers to only 48 points. 
After a confident win at home, 
the UCSD men traveled to San Francisco, hoping for a successful road trip the second week in a row. However, the Tritons couldn’t close in on the Gators after a tight score of 27-28 at halftime. San Francisco went on an 8-2 run with 12 minutes to go in the game, leaving the Tritons behind.
After suffering the loss to San 
Francisco on Friday, UCSD revved up play Cal State Monterey Bay on 
Saturday night. Though tired, the men were able to edge out the Otters for a four-point victory. 
Recently, the 
Tritons have struggled with back-to-back road games. However, leading scorer and guard Jordan Lawley took it upon himself Saturday to heave the team to victory with 28 points. Hatch also had a great game, scoring 17 points and shooting a perfect five-of-five from the free-throw line. Off the bench, freshman forward Justin Brue was a huge help, contributing six points in only 17 minutes of play.
“It was their senior night, ” Lawley 
said. “They had the competitive edge and we wanted to take it from them. ” 
Head coach Chris Carlson said he 
was pleased with the performance by Lawley, as well as the rest of the team. 
As a group that often struggles in the 
second half, he said it was important for the players to hold strong toward the end.
“Execution was good, ” he 
said. “The boys showed a lot of perseverance and mental toughness in the second half. ”
In order to make it to the playoffs, 
the Tritons must win their final two 
games of the regular season this 
weekend. As a senior and the team’s leading scorer, Lawley has assumed a leadership role. He said the team will need to maintain defensive ferocity to 4I\M7\\MZ

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — The 
Tritons were upstaged by the playoff-
bound Cal State Monterey Bay Otters on Feb. 20. The Otters handed UCSD its mere third loss of the season — but the second in its past four games — by a 68-57 decision. 
Outscoring UCSD 16-4 in the last 
3:15 of the game, the Otters used a late surge to down the Tritons. 
Junior forward Tiffany Hunter 
led the team with 18 points and nine rebounds, while sophomore guard Chelsea Carlisle added 17 points and four rebounds. 
Head coach Charity Elliott said 
she sees no particular trend in the Tritons’ recent troubles. 
“We’ve just had a couple of tough 
games, and we just haven’t met the intensity and focus of our opponent, ” head coach Charity Elliott said.  
The Otters’ win came a day after  
they beat Cal State East Bay to clinch their first-ever berth to the CCAA tournament. The Otters had never before beaten the Tritons. Head coach Renee Jimenez called the win over UCSD “without a doubt the biggest win in program history. ”
UCSD trailed by a point at 
halftime, but CSUMB’s Lindsay Trout’s fourth three-pointer of the game gave the Otters a seven-point advantage at five minutes into the second half. 
Though the Tritons were able to 
rally — and held a narrow 53-52 lead with 3:39 remaining — the Otters hit five of six free throws in the final minute to seal the win.
Cal State Monterey Bay was also 
able to take a 43-32 advantage in rebounding, including 14 offensive By Yvonne Chow

WOMEN’S TENNIS — The UCSD women’s tennis team stayed undefeat-ed against conference opposition in its first road trip of the season from Feb. 19 to Feb. 21 — bringing its record to 62 straight wins in the California Collegiate Athletic Association, and establishing itself as the pre-eminent Division-II title contender.
The No. 19 nationally ranked 
Tritons defeated CCAA foes No. 44 Sonoma State and No. 17 Cal State Stanislaus before losing to con-ference opponent UC Davis. The matches brought UCSD to 3-1 on the season and 3-0 in the CCAA.
Going into the weekend, head 
coach Liz LaPlante said she was unsure of how well the team would do, especially after matches were canceled due to rain earlier in the season.
“It was a little scary, but the lineup 
for these matches provided the level of competition we needed, ” LaPlante said. “It builds up our confidence to play against other teams in CCAA such as Cal State LA and Cal Poly Pomona.” 
UCSD’s first stop was at Rohnert 
Park against Sonoma State on Feb. 19, where it won decisively 8-1. The Tritons won three of three doubles matches and lost only one of six
