INSIDEThe U.S. Senate narrow ly 
passe d the Repu blican Part y’s
controversial tax reform bill on
Friday, which could have serious
consequences for future gra duate
students consi dering that the U.S.
House o f Representatives’ version
of the proposal contains provisions
that mi ght dissuade students from 
pursuing a graduate degree. While 
the fin al version of the bill h as 
yet to be decided on, a coa lition of advocates at UC San Die go is
working to com bat the potentia lly 
negative e ffects t he bill might have
on stu dents see king to further their
higher education.
The Senate’s version of the bill
marks the latest develo pment in a 
series of widel y contested provisions.
The earlier House  version contained 
policies t hat wou ld direct ly impact
college stu dents’ a bility to finance
their education.
Major items un der debate in
the proposal, which will be vote d on again once t he House’s an d the
Senate’s versions of the plan are
reconciled in one final bill , include
the taxing o f tuition fees an d the
elimin ation of tax deduct ions.
Tuition w aivers would  count as
taxable income and stude nts would
no lon ger be able to deduct the
accruin g interest rates from student
loans w hen filing taxes .

The SFAC sti pends are 
calculated  based  on the cost 
of tuition and student fees per
quarter for the current year. 
Stipends for mem bers o f the
Student Fee A dvisor y Committee
have been re lative ly unc hanged
for t he span o f its existence since
1976. For t he 2017-18 aca demic
year, annua l SFAC stipen ds equate
to $6 ,351, $4,210, and $2,105 for
SFAC’s chair, vice chair, and re gular
members, respectivel y.
Accordin g to the SFAC 2017-18
Committee Com pensation Schedule,
stipen ds for re gular mem bers are
equal to half the Ca lifornia resi dent
under graduate tuition and fees for 
one quarter, not inc luding campus-
based fees. Twice as muc h is pai d to
the vice c hair, and thrice as muc h to
the chair. T hus, as stu dents’ tuition
increases , so do SFAC mem bers’
stipends.
SFAC’s charter states that 
its primar y ro le is to ma ke
recommen dations on t he usa ge of 
the revenue generate d by the Stu dent
Services Fee. T he mone y for SFAC 
mem bers’ sti pends comes from t his
very fee. T hus, SFAC is in c harge of 
its own com pensat ion.
Accor ding to SFAC C hair E dward 
Lin, t he current SFAC sti pend model
was set in stone in 2 004 and has not
been su bject to c hange since. 
“It’s been what it’s been forever ,”
Vice C hance llor o f Stu dent A ffairs
budget consu ltant Jo hn Hu ghes sai d.
“I don’t see it chan ging, and I don’t 
see an yone comp lainin g about it. ”
The SFAC sti pend amount —
pulled from t he SSF budget — is
not vote d on eac h year, an d has 
been unc hanged for over a decade,
accor ding to Hu ghes. Meanw hile,
other stu dent or ganizations an d
services see king mone y from t he same 
SSF budget must su bmit a funding 
proposa l out lining t he funding t hey 
need eac h year, accor ding to SFAC 
Vice C hair Jo hn Laxa .
“Someone set the rate at some
point and it’s been the one we have had 
forever, ” Hughes said. “They [SFAC]
don’t tin ker wit h it. So annua lly, they 
don’t as k themse lves w hat are t hey 
going to pa y themselves. ”
Laxa noted that “anything that is
funded by SSF” un dergoes an annua l 
process o f submittin g a funding unit
proposal for evaluation b y SFAC.
However, this same process has not 
been use d to determine or c hange
SFAC sti pend amounts — w hich is
funded by SSF — for at least a decade
and likel y much lon ger, accordin g to
Hughes.
Lin concurred that this held  true 
during his tenure .CAMPUS

Chance llor Pra deep Khosla announce d this
afternoon t hat UC San Die go cleared the final 
hurdle to becomin g a Division-I universit y and was
invite d to join t he Big West At hletics Con ference.
Flanked by San Die go Ma yor Kevin Fau lconer, San
Diego Re giona l Chamber o f Commerce Presi dent
Jerry San ders, Director o f Athletics Ear l Edwards,
and severa l others on sta ge at RIMAC Arena, K hosla 
hailed UCSD’s acce ptance to t he NCAA con ference
as “a ver y lon g time comin g for our Tritons and
Triton family.”
CSU Bakersfield also acce pted an invitation to
join the Bi g West Conference .
The announcement , which involved fanfare like
performances from the Pe p Band, marks the latest
development in UCSD Athletics’ year-and-a-half -
long effort to jump from Division-II to Division-I,
although it wi ll take unti l 2020 for all athletics teams
to compete at t his higher level.
The process first began in Ma y 2016 w hen
students vote d overw helmingly in favor o f raisin g
their activit y fees to help meet the financial 
threshold that is re quired for universities to compete
at the highest level of interco llegiate at hletics.
The Aca demic Senate t hen sent an a dvisor y vote
supportin g the Tritons’ move to Division-I to K hosla,
whose approva l cleared the wa y for the universit y to
pursue an invitation to t he Big West Con ference .
In or der for UCSD to secure mem bership, seven
of the nine Bi g West Con ference mem ber nee ded tovote “yes, ” which initiall y p r o v e d  t o  b e  a n  o b s t a c l e
for the school. Com prised of four UC cam puses,
four Ca lifornia State Universities, an d the Universit y 
of Hawaii at Manoa, t he con ference re jected UCSD’s 
first mem bership bid in A pril 2017 .
This time, however, UCSD receive d the necessar y 
num ber of affirmative votes from t he other sc hools.
Accor ding to E dwards, the Bi g West Con ference
changed its stance w hen t he possi bility of adding
CSU Bakersfield to the conference alon gside UCSD
arose , which maintains the balance between CSU
and UC schools in the Bi g West .
“[Movin g to Division-I] will si gnificantl y increase
our visi bility and align us wit h simi lar institutions
with whom we alread y compete, ” Khosla said .
The 2016 referendum m andated  that stude nt
fees rise beginnin g this aca demic year t hrough the
2019-2020 year. However, because UCSD was not yet
invite d to the Big West Con ference at t he start o f this
year, t he fee increases wi ll be imp lemente d beginnin g
with the 2018-2019 aca demic year. A djusted for
inflation, t he stu dent activit y fee wi ll increase by $60 
per quarter for the 2018-2019 aca demic year, t hen
again by $55 per quarter for the 2019-2020 aca demic
year, an d then one last time by anot her $45 per
quarter for the 2020-2021 aca demic year.;%85)2307 CAMPUS

The drug is delivere d with three in jections into t he cere brospina l fluid, which is provin g to be a c hallenge for the team .SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
Accor ding to an artic le from T he
San Die go Union-Tri bune, Car lsbad’s
Ionis Pharmaceuticals (previousl y 
known as Isis P harmaceutica ls)
is expecte d to re lease c linica l
trial results  for the treatment of 
Huntin gton’s and Lou Gehri g’s 
disease with a new “desi gner DNA
drug,”  which mutes t he mutant gene 
responsi ble for causin g nervous 
system deterioration .
Last year, Ionis Pharmaceuticals
obtaine d approva l for S pinraza, 
which accor ding to t he Union -
Tribune “uses a similar a pproach … 
to success fully treat a neuro logical 
condition that kills one in 1 ,000 
children before t hey reac h their
secon d birthday.”
Early tria l resu lts for t he drug
have shown “a reduct ion in l evels 
of the harmful proteins believed tocause the diseases, ” per the Union -
Tribune’s report .
Dr. Ric hard Smit h, a local
neuro logist an d director o f the
Center for Neurolo gic Stud y in La 
Jolla, told the Union-Tribune that
the pat hway for this new drug was
etched a decade ago an d was met
with some s kepticism initia lly. He 
stated that the “ point that has drawn
the most s kepticism from peers has
always been drug delivery.”
The blood -brain barrier to the 
drug’s deliver y which, accordin g 
to Smith, “requires three dru gs
to be in jected direct ly into t he
cerebrospina l fluid” is t he biggest
challenge to t he drug’s success.
“Such an a pproach would result 
in dru gs simpl y floatin g around
doing not hing,”  S m i t h exp laine d to
the Union-Tri bune.
Smith, who did pioneerin g
work in the use of in terferon to 
treat neuro logica l diseases an d has treated patients with Lou Gehrig’s,
also known as ALS , told the Union -
Tribune that “he had an in tuitive
feeling that these drugs, these tin y 
pieces of DNA, might surprise 
ever yone.”
UC San Die go neuro biologist
Don C leveland, who is known for
his foundational resea rch on the
mechanisms of neuron growth and
protein pro duction, was approac hed
by Smit h durin g that same perio d to
start t he initia l steps for the creation
of this potential new treatment,
accor ding to the Union-Tri bune.
Cleveland an d Smit h pitched
the treatment idea to Fr ank 
Bennett , who holds a doctorate in
pharmaco logy and is t he current
senior vice presi dent o f researc h at
Ionis Pharmaceut icals at around the
same time. 
Bennett became part o f the pro ject 
even thou gh Ionis Pharmaceuticals 
“was not at the time involved withtrying to use t he tec hnology on
neuro logical diseases, ” he sai d to the
Union-Tri bune.
Positive initial trial results and
the advent of upcomin g trials for 
the new drug treatment have cau ght 
the attention of the Am erican
Neuro logical Association at its
most recent annual conference , the
Union-Tri bune sai d.
The drug, developed by the Ionis
and New Yor k Cold Sprin g Har bor
Laborator y, was approved b y the 
U.S. Food and Dru g Administration 
in December 2016 and “has alread y 
been delivered to hundreds of 
children an d adults an d, in man y 
cases, has dramaticall y reversed
nerve dama ge, ” sai d the Union -
Tribune. #1%0-% 8)57%352).3

Alicia  Hothe tax proposal.
This past We dnesday the UC
Student-Wor kers Union (UAW
Local 2865) held a graduate
student wa lk-out on Li brary Wa lk 
in protest o f the bill’s effects on
students, where the prompt, “ As astu
dent wor ker I (we) ... ” a ppeare d
throughout p hotographs of students
on socia l me dia documentin g the
event. 
Angela Berti and the Stewards
of the Student-Workers Union
collective ly commente d on t he
importance o f demonstratin g
opposition to t he bill. 
“These chan ges would make
higher education inaccessible 
for all but the most financiall y 
privile ged and particularl y affect 
international stude nts and stude nts
historica lly un derrepresente d in
higher e ducation, ” t he Stewar ds
told the UCSD Guardian. “Further , 
international and non-resident
students pa y approximatel y double
the tuition of in-state  stude nts and
the amount of tax owed could  be
proportiona lly greater. ”
Amon g the most severe c hanges
is the removal of Section 117d o f 
the tax code which would repeal tuition an
d fee waivers for gra duate 
students, ma king t hem count as 
taxable income.
Kimberly McCa be, t he vice 
president of external affairs for 
the UCS D Graduate Student
Association explained this processto the Guardian. 
“A graduate student is never 
receivin g this mone y,”  Mc C a be sai d. 
“Most graduate students receivetuition waivers in exc hange for 
doin g TAships or research pro grams,
so they wou ld receive a waiver for
teaching a class at 10 hours a wee k,
and then you would receive a small
stipend in a ddition to t hat.”
McCa be note d that graduate
students alread y jump throu gh
financia l hurdles wit h sti pends 
ranging from a bout $13,000 to
$33,000 per year. Un der t he ne w 
tax plan, waived tuition fees would
be included with the stipend as
taxable income; for exam ple, if a
student receives a $13,000 sti pend
and a $16,500 tuition waiver, t hey 
will be taxe d like they’re being paid 
$29,500.
Docto ral stude nts would bear
the heaviest toll because the y spend 
the bulk of their time con ductin g
researc h and not in c lassrooms ,
McCa be explaine d.
Overa ll, McCa be believes t hat 
the tax plan will onl y further restrict
access to hi gher education .
“It’s a disaster ,” she said. “It’s 
untena ble, and what it wi ll do, the
direct consequence o f that is peop le
will not be able to go to graduate 
school un less t hey’re a lready 
independentl y wealth y. And that’s 
not the wa y that education should
be run. Educat ion has been said to
be an equa lizer, somet hing that can 
help level the playing field.”
However , McCa be asserte d
that wi th the most detrimental 
aspects bein g excluded from the 
bill’s version passed in the Senate,
the GSA wi ll remain vi gilant an d
is “cautiousl y optimistic” on ho w 
dissentin g popu lar opinion an d 
political en gagement will resonate
within the bill’s final version.Accor ding to Dean o f the UCSD 
Graduate Division Kit Po gliano, the
universit y is explorin g options for
helping gra duate stu dents s hould
the bill pass wit h the provisions t hat
affect them.
“Right now we are discussin g
the Gra duate Division’s potentia l 
reactive measures, ” Po gliano told the 
Guardian. “I am ho peful that tuition
fees would  not be counted as taxable
income. I f we can maintain t hat, we
wou ld eliminate t he heaviest im pact
our grad students would face. ”
Pogliano also spoke out on the 
Universit y of California’s efforts to
prope lling a UC A dvocacy Networ k 
call-to-action campai gn aroun d tax 
reform.
“It is criticall y important to get 
the messa ge to Con gress, ” Po gliano
noted. “Graduate students re present
many o f our future leaders an d 
the professiona ls that wi ll take our
countr y forwar d. This bill wou ld
reduce t heir a bility to serve t he
communit y.”
Continuin g their efforts a gainst 
the tax plan, GSA will be holdin g
phone banks for gra duate stu dents
to lobby their local representatives
on Dec. 6. Locate d in the GSA office
on t he fourt h floor o f Price Center ,
they will be providin g call scripts, 
trainin g for first-time callers, and 
statistics a bout t he im pacts o f this
bill on UC stu dents.“During my time serving on 
SFAC, t here has not been ex plicit
discussion o f the stipen d pai d out
to commi ttee members other than 
logistica l matters suc h as t he hiring
paperwor k at t he beginning o f each
school year, ” Lin wrote in an emai l.
Lin noted , however , that a fixed
stipend rate cou ld be a potentia l
alternative to t he current mo del, in 
which stipen ds change depen ding on
changes in tuition.
“I can envision a s ystem where
stipen ds are a flat rate regar dless
of the cost o f other man datory 
registration fees but amendments to
the [c]harter would need to be made
for this to ta ke place, ” Lin wrote .
As a point o f com parison, t he 
SFAC c hair’s sti pend, divided over 
30 weeks, is approximatel y equal 
to that of the A.S. vice presidents
and financia l contro ller, w ho receive 
$200 per wee k, while the SFAC vice
chair is paid sli ghtly m o r e  t h a n  t h e  
A.S. associate vice presidents, who 
make $100 per wee k. The regu lar 
mem bers, w hose sti pends amount 
to about $66 per wee k, receive overtriple the A.S. senators’ $20 per wee k. 
Hughes and Lin, who attends

Despite 
69 percent of countries follow right-
side-of-the-road rules, UC San
Diego has found a wa y to break
things better. It just so happens to be
your ankle. The school has found a
way to enroll students (and staff) that 
activel y disregard sidewalk etiquette.
I must have missed this question on m
y application, but based on the
number of pedestrian collisions I see 
on a dail y basis, this had to be an
admission requirement. So, in orde r 
to survive this concrete jungle full 
of dangers, we need to revisit such 
sidewalk etiquette.
Lesson One: Unless you’re
wearing a kilt or sporting an English
accent, you have no reason to be
walking on the left side of the road.
This is America; we didn’t win a
Revolutionar y War for nothing. You
are not changing histor y or “sticking
it to the man” b y walking on the
wrong side. The onl y impact you
will have is your fanc y Earl Gre y 
tea smashing the ground. The Battleof Yorktown doesn’t compare to the 
sound and the fur y we will unleash 
on you if we’re late to class .
Lesson Two: If you have to cross,
please remember your elementar y
school lessons and look left, right,
left bef ore an electric skateb oard
hits you like a pro jectile missile.
You have ever y right to cross the 
road or sidewalk. All we’re asking
LVWKDW\RXORRNÀUVWDQGGRVRZLWK
convicti on. Have t o cross in fr ont 
of bikers? Either wait or do so fast.
Need to cut between a crowd to get to class? Sa
y “excuse me,” and don’t 
dilly dall y. See a doggo, pupper, o r 
woofer? Go get’em, Tiger. Just take
DZDONLQJJODQFHÀUVW
Lesson Three: Save your gaming
and social media f or another time.
Now, of course, we’ve all beenthere. Watching the Insta-likes rollin on 
your latest sunset post before 
slamming into that rogue penn y
boarder. Peeping your crush’s snap
story from last night while almost 
crashing into a Eucal yptus tree.
6FUROOLQJWKURXJKÀQDOVPHPHVRQ
your penn y board before hitting 
some craz y pedestrian. Even I just 
got laid out b y a Big Bell y trash
can while writing this article on m y
phone. Keep your heads up and e yes 
open.
Lesson Four: If you are riding 
a bike, skateboard, rollerblades, o r 
you’re that one kid who rides that 
monowheeled segwa y (rock on,
man), it’s simple — don’t be a jerk.
You know we walkers take twice as
long to get to class. And you should
know our reacti ons are twice as
slow. So don’t cut us off or zigzag
between us like F ormula One race r 
drivers. You’re just asking for a pile
up there. Instead, look at that vast oasis of street directl
y next to us. It’s
all yours, Andretti.
In short, practice good sidewalk
etiquette. Take a walk on the right 
side, save the League of Legends 
gaming for your room, and keep 
your e yes up. Life moves prett y fast.
If you don’t stop and look around
once in awhile, you could miss it. O r 
you could walk into a Big Bell y trash
can. Watch out for those, the y come
out of nowhere. UC San Diego provides its students a four- year 
plan, and most freshmen go into college thinking 
they’ll follow it. The y’re wrong. At UCSD, the
number of academic credits one has determines thei r 
enrollment times; the more credits you have, the
earlier you enroll in courses. However, the enrollment 
system forces students to compete for spots in
RYHUÀOOHGFODVVHV8QIRUWXQDWH O\WKHSUHVHQWV\VWHP
is unfair since Advanced Placement transfer credits
are counted when scheduling appointment times,
disadvantaging students who come from backgrounds
which prevent them from taking these courses.
Most students who started college with few
transferable credits c ome fr om areas with out access t o
AP classes. Th ose students’ families c ould n ot afford
to send their children to high-tuition private schools
RUVXVWDLQWKHFRVWRI OLYLQJLQDQDIÁXHQWFRPPXQLW \
with a well-funded public school that offers A P 
courses. Those students usuall y went to cash-strapped
public schools where college-level courses were not 
offered, or transferred to UCSD from abroad where
AP courses are never offered. Man y had to overcome
adversities that often plague poor communities such
as overcr owded sch ools and disincentivized teachers
RUVLPSO\FRXOGQRWDIIRUGWRWDNHWKHÀQD OWHVWIRU
college credit. UCSD, part of the UC s ystem which
purportedl y aims for the advancement of low-income
students, works against these students b y giving an
DUWLÀFLDOO\ORZVWDUWWRVWXGHQWVZLWKRXW$3FUHGLWV
It is clear that in order to bring more equalit y the
enrollment s ystem should be changed. 
Some universities, such as NYU Gallatin School
of Individualized Stud y, allow AP credits to be
included onl y at the end of the second year, thus 
ensuring that AP credit does not affect freshmen and
sophomore enrollment times. UC Irvine has a s ystem
where freshmen are assigned random times, while
others have their times assigned based on their creditsincluding APs. However, neither of those s ystems 
solve the problem completel y since the non-A P 
students still get disadvantaged after one or two years.
Another possible s ystem would be to exclude 
AP credit entirel y when scheduling enrollment 
times. Since all freshmen will enter with n o credits
counting toward their enrollment times, the y would
get their assignment times randoml y. However, b y 
the second year, highl y-motivated students who took
an abundance of courses in their freshman year could
accrue enough credit to merit an earlier appointment 
time. This s ystem would allow UCSD to institute a
merit-based s ystem of enrollment, equalizing students
with and with out AP credits.
Such a drastic change in the structure of 
appointment times seems like it might comes with
some downsides. These c oncerns can all be addressed. 
First, the new s ystem is countered b y an idea that 
people who took AP courses are not competing for the 
same c ourses as th ose wh o did n ot because their A P 
credits waive lower-division courses. However, this is
usuall y not the case. Students are required to take thei r introductor y writing sequences, general education 
requirements, and other courses which cannot be 
waived. Therefore, including AP credits in the
V\VWHPDUWLÀFLD OO\HOHYDWHVWKHVWDWXVRI$3VWXGHQWV
competing for the same general education courses.
Also, AP courses often do not waive an y courses
either because the y were taken outside of a person’s 
major or because their content does not match the 
content of existing universit y courses .
Secondl y, man y would be ignited at the fact that 
students who worked hard to pass their AP courses
would be stripped of their advantage. This is not 
entirel y true. AP Students at UCSD are still in a bette r 
position than in man y other universities like California 
Institute of Technolog y where AP courses are not 
accepted at all, Dartmouth College where scores are 
accepted onl y for placement but without credit, o r 
New York Universit y and Stanford Universit y where
the AP scores below four are not accepted. Moreover,most students did not expect advantages in enrollment 
when the y were taking the courses — most schools do
not have appointment times at all and those who have
frequentl y excluded AP credits from determining it.
For man y students, AP courses were simpl y a wa y to
show that the y are competitive and highl y motivated
IRUFROOHJHDGPLVVLRQVVLQFHWKH8&V\VWHPRIÀFLDOO\
considers AP courses for admission purposes.
All in all, the current UCSD enrollment s ystem
consistentl y disadvantages students without A P 
credits. It is unfair that students wh o have n ot had
an opportunit y to get AP credits but who worked 
hard to get into college cannot have as good of 
a college experience as others. As a student who
choses to go to public universit y, you receive both
the burden and the privilege of bringing equalit y into
education. Unfortunatel y, sometimes this might entail
surrendering some advantages for other students’
sake.“As a student who cho ses 
to go to pu blic universit y,
you receive both the burden
and the privilege of bringing 
equality into e ducation. 
Unfortunately, sometimes this 
might entail surren dering
some a dvantages for othe r 
students’ sake.”
Throughout our years at UC San Diego, we all have or will encounter coursework that 
falls under the categor y of Diversit y, Equit y, and Inclusion. However, what man y of us
do not know is that DEI was originall y created in response to the Compton Cookout. This 
racist event hosted b y several fraternities in 2010 that involved students dressing in black
face, or in stereot ypicall y “ghetto” clothing, sparked outrage that led to mass protests on 
campus. Out of this, DEI was born with the intent to eliminate bigoted ideologies from
students. 
Seven years later, however, students seem apathetic toward the message of empath y
that DEI was supposed to provide. In October, Identit y Evropa, a white supremacist 
group, hung racist banners outside of Price Center. Then, in November, a student went in
to an online midterm stud y guide for a computer science course and put the N-word in it 
86 times. Neither of these instances sparked massive and immediate outrage from eithe r 
students or the administration. While Dean Al Pisano of the Jacobs School of Engineering 
did serve as a representative to the universit y by condemning the incident via email, it is
clear that, for the administration, actions speak louder than words .
DEI is currentl y doing a disservice to minorit y students b y failing to meet its
educational goals due to lax standards and poor organization. As shown b y the apathetic
response of students toward those two racist events, it is clear that DEI courses have yet 
to instill an appreciation for diversit y in students. This is because the courses currentl y
offered under DEI fail to humanize the marginalized groups who suffer from these racists
ideologies. The student felt that inserting the N-word into the stud y guide caused no
harm to other students. One student, who was interviewed about their time in the course,
disagreed. He said that he has seen women and people of color face the same criticism and

presen t on campus .
 Despite the shortcomings of DEI, UCSD still has the abilit y to align itself on
the right side of histor y, as was its original intentions. However, several changes must 
be made in order for this alignment to occur. First and foremost, the administration must 
require students to take DEI more seriousl y. The fact that students can take their DEI 
requirement for pass or no pass is s ymbolic of the universit y’s disingenuous approach to
combating bigotr y. Enforcing the letter grade option as a standard compels students to
stay engaged with the material, whereas the pass or no pass option permits students to pa y 
the bare am ount of attenti on.
Most importantl y, DEI must encourage empath y. One of the best wa ys to instill
empath y into students’ ps yche is through a combination of lectures that provide historical 
context and discussion sections that allow for a more personal approach to understanding 
the human consequences of bigotr y. Discussion sections can provide this b y allowing
students, facult y, and members of the communit y to have a space where the y can share 
their personal stories and experiences with bigotr y to students currentl y taking the DE I

requirement. Also, discussion sections offer a
platform where teaching assistants can explore the 
ÀJXUHVWKDWGLUHFWO \LPSDFWHGWKHKLVWRULFDOFKDQ JHV
introduced in lecture. B y doing so, this will humanize
the issue of bigotr y because it will allow students to
see just how drasticall y marginalizations can affect 
one’s life .
This approach alread y takes place on campus.
As a part of the Thurgood Marshall College graduation
requirements, students must take the Dimensions
of Culture series. DOC 1 is appropriatel y named
“Diversit y.” Here, students learn a more complete
history of the United States, as the struggle of man y
PLQRULW\JURXSVLQWKHÀJKWDJDLQVWZKLWHVXSUHPDF\LV
the foundation of the coursework. Further, students are
encouraged to share their own experiences with bigotr y, 
both in the classroom and in written assignments. If UC
San Diego standardized a DEI course in the likeness
of DOC 1 across all six campuses, the administration
would be taking responsibilit y for the current apathetic mindset of the student bod y by recognizing that harmful
misconceptions are still prevalent in societ y.
At the end of the da y, DEI is meant to serve 
as a medium to facilitate the discussion about bigotr y
and empath y. The idea of challenging bigotr y is not 
“social justice” run amok; it is imperative to remembe r 
that, despite political leanings, these biases against minorit
y groups come with real human consequences. 
Further, we can not be afraid to tell people that the y 
are wrong. Opinions rooted in the marginalization of 
other people must be confronted. B y doing this, we 
are recognizing that bigotr y is a human rights issue of 
drastic proportions. When we look at the amount of 
African Americans wrongfull y murdered b y the police,
the am ount of lower class citizens wh o are shamed f or 
their socioeconomic status, or the countless cases of 
harassment toward LGBT Q+ students, it is clear that a 
complacent approach to bigotr y is no longer an option.
By revising the DEI requirement, with its focus placed
on humanization, the administration would be taking
steps in the right direction for both educational and 
social change .▶DEI,from pa ge 4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , DECEMBER 4, 2017 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.OR G 	 

covered with motivational

“Have you ever watched ‘Shark Tank’? It’s basically a collegiate 
form o f that, [ but] it’s not going to be that muc h roastin g,”
Aggarwal joked .
From solar-powered tiki torches to improvin g kinder garten
education in Fi ji, the competition was a fascinatin g watc h. The
Guardian spoke with Raul Correa, Muir Colle ge junior and leader
of the team SEND (Sustainable Economic Network Deliver y). “So
right now, Amazon is tr ying to do drone deliveries but the problem
with that is t hey can’t do it in cities because t he [Foo d and Dru g
Administration] restricts that, ” Correa ex plained. “So what we’re
proposin g to do is imp lement it in rura l areas — vi llages w here 
they can’t get me dical supp lies.”
The winning team, Baja Solar Water Heater Project, will go on
to participate against other major universities such as UC Berkeley,
UCLA, Co lumbia Universit y, Harvar d Universit y, an d Drexe l
Universit y. Their o bjective focuses on designing and insta lling 
solar therma l water heaters in c hildren’s homes in Ti juana, in
partners hip wit h La Mision C hildren’s Fun d.
This socia l innovation aspect o f the competition is w hat sets
the Hult Prize a part and makes it an im portant event at UCSD.
“Initially I wanted to create a business. I learned more about what
a socia l enterprise is, an d that’s more o f what I’m startin g to look 
into ri ght now and what I want to do, ” Correa said. “It’s a business
with a cause to it. ” T his is a sentiment expresse d by the founders 
themselves — “leadin g a generation to chan ge the world” is the
main messa ge on t heir we bsite.
The arts versus sciences debate is ongoing at UCSD, but
business alwa ys seems to lie somewhere in the middle of the
spectrum, seemin gly without muc h help from t he universit y.
“Basicall y, we are a research institute; we are a STEM-based
school, where t he stu dents w ho are in business or entre preneurs hip 
don’t find a nic he for them, ” A ggarwa l said. Not man y business -
oriente d competitions happen at UCSD, an d the impressive
resources available , such as The Basement , the StartR accelerator
at Rad y, and the other incubation pro grams, are lar gely unheard
of by students.
“So people don’t know about that and that we can actuall y 
compete, or the y’re reall y scared of where to start, ” he said. “They 
don’t even know t hat San Die go has some o f the biggest venture
capita lists an d angel investors in Ca lifornia … we actua lly have
an an gel investor on campus associate d with The Basement t hat
works at UCSD. ” An gel investors are a ffluent in dividuals who 
suppl y fundin g for startups in exchan ge for ownership equit y 
or converti ble debt. This gap in t he universit y’s aca demics an d
resources exemp lifies the necessit y of the Hu lt Prize .
“It can be like a startin g point for students, under grads
especiall y, to get into the entrepreneur world and to see ho w 
they can actuall y monetize their idea and not go toward research
altogether, ” A ggarwal said. “We want to chan ge the culture at
UCSD. ”
So what exact ly is T he Basement?
“It’s basicall y an on-campus incubator, where you have an
idea but don’t know w hat to do wit h it, so t hey help you ma ke it
into an actual business model, and then you go to an accelerator
where you ask for fundin g, etc. ” A ggarwal said. This pattern o f 
ideation, incu bation, acce leration is an exce llent wa y to encoura ge
innovation an d ideas, t he on ly thing we know for sure wi ll allow us
to move forwar d in the future e fficient ly.

win t he prize mone y.
“If the y win this round, the y can make one of the best networksin the world, [because] there’s a hu ge platform, and you get to
networ k with ever yone an d get intro duced to venture capita lists, ”
Aggarwal said. “And [for] people who don’t win ri ght now, we’ll
take their pitches and send them for incubation, ” not to mention
the huge boost to resumes t hat this experience wou ld bring.
“They don’t have to look for jobs after that; the y can make their
job,”  Aggarwa l declared.
Correa is also excited about the ex perience in itself, win or lose.
“Now that I’ve seen the possibilities of The Basement, it motivates
me to t hink about m y idea for next year, ” he sai d.
Other universities seem to be much further in this field. “ A
lot of them do the same t hing [hostin g], but w hat you see is a lot
of them have a better structure an d an entire department for this
stuff, ” Correa said. “It’s a need, and ri ght now social enterprise
is what ever yone wants to go into, with sustainabilit y and clean 
energy. ”
Being UCSD’s first time hostin g, the competition wasn’t without
challenges: a late start an d therefore rus hed beginnin gs amon g 
them. “I missed all the deadlines!” A ggarwal said, lau ghing 
sheepishl y. “We are just sophomores on the board so we didn’t
know, but The Basement, especiall y Silvia and Briana, have helped 
us throughout thi s
journe y— the y have been our bi ggest support, and if the y 
weren ’t on cam pus w e
wou ldn’t have been a ble to do this so quic kly.”
Since the “Hult Prize@UCSD” onl y takes up fall quarter,
Aggarwa l and other stu dents have more long-term p lans t hey want
to commit to as we ll, to prevent t he club from becomin g inactive
the next two quarters. This includes a completely student-run 
startup class offered next quarter.
“There was Triton entrepreneurs last year but that didn’t 
go we ll. We are tr ying to build on t hose princip les wit h new 
leadership, ” A ggarwal said. “ We will prepare [interested students]
in Innovation C lub for ot her entrepreneuria l challenges in
California, an d use campus resources, train t hem pro fessiona lly 
with incu bators, an d actua lly get UCSD’s name out. ”
Like other ma jors t hat feel underrepresente d at UCSD, t his is 
an important goal for A ggarwal and his team members. “I want 
to actua lly show t he wor ld, that UCSD’s not just a bout researc h or
STEM su bjects; it’s a lso about entrepreneurs hip, an d innovation, ”
he said. “Ever yone thinks this is a research institute where
the ma jority of the students are either premed, neuroscientists, 
psycholo gists or en gineers, but not man y think about the aspect o f 
entrepreneurshi p.”
In the future, A ggarwa l hopes to demonstrate t hat app lying
STEM know ledge towar d socia l innovation is definite ly important
and is as equa lly capa ble of changing the wor ld as researc h.
“For me, I would want to go back to India, I don’t want to be
part of the ‘brain drain’ of the countr y, ” he explained. “So man y 
students come here to stud y, and then settle here. Ever yone
comp lains o f the pro blems In dia has — jobs, tec hnology, resources
etc., but no one does an ything about it. No one tries to go back and
tackle those c hallenges. I want to go back and try to so lve some o f 
the problems t hat In dia has.”

Let’s be honest here; as t he holidays begin to creep up on us, t here is a sense of panic t hat 
overw helms t he college stu dent popu lation. W hat do we get for our friends and family? An d even
more importantly, how can we afford it all? Well, fear not! I have listed below several fun and practical
gifts that won’t break the bank, all in the name of Christmas shopping by students, for students.
Route one: techie stuff. For a practical and affordable gift, there’s nothing better than technolog y 
accessories. A new phone case, laptop case, keyboard cover, or new headphones would make an y 
student feel a bit giddy. Amazon is especiall y good for pickin g up tech gifts, and you can use your 
student Amazon Prime account for shippin g as well .
Route two: gift cards. These are especiall y good for food and clothes. People mi ght sa y gift cards
are impersonal, but I feel that there’s an unspoken a greement amon g colle ge students that sa ys
we don’t care. Whether it’s for Baskin Robbins or Staples, there’s a gift card out there that will be
appreciated b y the person you’re shoppin g for.
Route three: interior decorations. Thin gs like succulents, kitchen accessories, and throw pillows
are small  things  that can add something  extra  to a room  without  causing  you to go bankrupt . Even  are small things that can add something extra to a room without causing you to go bankrupt Even
a cute mu g can bri ghten up someone’s holida ys if you put enou gh thou ght into it. A quick trip to 
somewhere like Tar get or Potter y Barn will give you plent y of options for this cate gory. Thou gh 
Potter y Barn is sometimes on t he expensive si de, there are tons o f holiday deals to ta ke advanta ge of 
on its website. 
If you sti ll nee d some met hods to further minimize spen ding, have no fear! Secret Santa is a
common tra dition use d to give c heap gifts amon g larger groups o f peop le. But i f you absolutely can’t 
spend any more mone y than necessar y, just get cra fty. Ever yone loves a handwritten car d filled with
inside jokes or a scrap book that contains your fondest memories. An d even i f you can’t get someone
you love a gi ft for w hatever reason, I’m sure t hat you can find some way to s how your appreciation 
this holiday season!ItItiis a un iiversalllly yacknkowleldgdgeddttruththtthahtt momsmsaareressupupererheheroroesesiinn didisgsguiuisese. ThThisisccananmmakake ehoholilidaday y

to “wow” the mom in your life.
Face Masks
This gift may seem like a simple choice, but a good face mask is perfect for the busy and selfle ss 
mom that rarely gives herself time to relax. This type of mom may not always go out of her way to bu y 
something just for herself, so a self-care gift will undoubtedly be appreciated. Amazon has different shee t 
mask bundles that offer a variety of different solutions and formulas, but your mom’s favorite face ma sk 
can work, too.
Decorative P lants
Plants have the power to liven up a room durin g the holida y season. If your mom has a green thum b, 
a plant that is more involved, like a poinsettia that can be planted after the holida ys, can be a great pro ject. 
If your mom does not have a green thumb but loves plants an yway, Trader Joe’s has recentl y come ou t 
with air plants attached to Christmas ornaments, so a few of those low-maintenance plants would be a 
great alternative.
Warm A ccesso ries
Fuzzy  socks , scarves , gloves , beanies , blankets  — anything  goes  if it is warm!  Most  people  would Fuzzy socks scarves gloves beanies blankets anything goes if it is warm! Most people wou ld
appreciate an y of these accessories in the next comin g weeks. However, selectin g these accessories from 
your mom’s favorite store or brand can ma ke this gift choice extra t houghtful.
Something homemade
Any mom wi ll appreciate t he extra e ffort in a handmade gift. A cute i dea wou ld be to decorate a w hite 
picture frame wit h red stripes — t hese can be ma de wit h mar kers, paint, glitter, or even ri bbons. For even 
more holiday cheer, consi der gluing on fake holly at t he corners. T hen, insert a holiday photo o f you an d
your mom. I f somet hing cra fty does not soun d too appea ling, a homema de holiday mea l wou ld also be 
appreciate d. Ma king your mom’s favorite mea l or warm dessert on a co ld winter day can be just as cra fty 
and origina l!
Something Els e
Every mom is different an d will want different t hings t his holiday season. W hile these are just some
basic suggestions, you know your mom best, an d you can c hoose w hatever gi ft will make her the happiest!
Another year abruptl y comin g to an end can onl y mean one thin g — it’s Christmas season. 
Aside from the beautifull y decorated homes, hot-chocolate-drinkin g weather, and joyful 
Christmas music, t his is t he time w here you can get overw helmed trying to find the per fect gi ft. 
Choosing a gi ft that shows e ffort an d uniqueness can be difficult. In t he past I wou ld often wait
until the last minute to go gift searchin g, resultin g in strain that could have been easil y prevented
if I started ahead of time. Life would be so much easier if w e were able to walk in to a store and 
find exact ly what we nee d. Un fortunate ly, we are not a lways t hat lucky, so I compose d a gift gui de
to help. Be low you wi ll find a gui de geare d towar d gym ent husiasts because we a ll know someone 
special in our lives who appreciates fitness and wants to start off the new year healthier than the 
last. Happ y shoppin g!
Hydro Flask: $3 0
Whether you are gift shopping for your great-grandma or nephew, one can not go wrong with
a Hydro Flask. Takin g the world b y storm this year, it’s currentl y one of the most-demanded water
bottles on t he mar ket. Its durability and insu lation a llow peop le to sta y hydrated throughout 
the day an d never in nee d to buy anot her bottle. Y ou can purc hase t hese at t he UC San Diego
Bookstore, Amazon, or any of the markets on campus.
Gym Wear: $50-7 0
No fitness fanatic can have too man y gym clothes. Most peop le wait to buy new attire unti l
their every day wears can’t last anot her day — ma king gym appare l a exce llent gi ft choice. Due to the wi de selection o f different brands, it is eas y to find great deals on line or t he local outlets, 
which will prevent you from overexten ding your budget. I recommen d shopping at local stores
like Ross Dress for Less, Marshalls, and Target .
Fitness Watc h: $50, $100, $20 0
Want to gift that specia l someone a gift they’ll use an d wear ever y chance t hey get? Fitness

calories, steps, and so much more. Recommended brands include Fitbit, Apple Watch, and
Samsun g. Y ou can find these items available in stores like Mac y’s, Tar get, and Apple. 
Gym Bag: $40
Nothing is more annoying t han having to carry a ll your belongings to eac h mac hine in t he

a stylish workout ba g. The y will thank you later for finall y bein g able to throw out their old tote
bag. Check your local sports store or Amazon to find the ideal bag.
Yoga mat: $2 0
Know someone who is tired of borrowin g mats at the gym or practices meditation? Gift them 
a yoga mat to help make their lives easier. Its affordabilit y and versatilit y make it an essential for
any fitness lover. Y ou can find yoga mats at most department stores an d Amazon.

‘Tis the season! No matter how you celebrate, winter holida ys alwa ys seem to brin g 
joy, especia lly throug h gift giving. But sometimes getting a present for someone can 
be unexpecte dly stress ful. Whether it’s a new suitemate for secret santa or t he UCSD 
Meme Face book page’s w hite elephant, here are some i deas for a person you don’t know 
all that well.
To start, do some researc h about t he person in question. Put t hose socia l media skills
to the test, an d look throug h their Instagram or Pinterest for ideas. T his wi ll allow you
to get a rea lly goo d idea of their persona l style based on how t hey post an d the types o f 
pages t hey like. Once you have a genera l idea of what they like, you can start narrowin g
things down based on your budget an d convenience.
At events like these, you are not expecte d to go over t he top or out o f your way to 
get an extravagant gi ft, especia lly if you don’t know t he person a ll that we ll. But once 
you pick out a gift, be sure to put it in nice packaging. It seems obvious, but presentin g
a nicely wrapped present says a lot about how much you care. So be sure to check “gift 
wrapped” before you order off Amazon! Speaking of Amazon, ask the person being 
shopped for to send you their wishlist. If it’s anything like mine, it’s probably filled with 
random gifts they promised to treat themselves to.
In addition to these tips for narrowin g down ideas, you can also build off these
suggestions. With the person’s sense of st yle in mind, you can alwa ys appl y it to small
gifts such as mu gs, craz y socks, pa jama pants, laptop stickers, and phone cases. If you 
want, you can even get a premade gift basket, but be sure to check ever ything that’s
included in it! (Y ou mi ght not want to get someone who is health-conscious an oversized
cookie. )
Now you have all you need to get the perfect gift, time to go shoppin g!

PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY DAVID JUAREZ10     THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , DECEMBER 4, 2017 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG A&E
Over the last 10 weeks, I’ve shared with you my stories of people, of cultural 
differences, of adventure. We’ve explored relationships with my family, all the foods the Philippines has to offer, and my experience of having two homes at once. It’s safe 
to say I know how growing up with a multi-cultural background has changed my identity and outlook on the world. 
However, it’s up to me to decide how it will impact me in the future. Many people have asked if I’ d ever move back to the Philippines. This is a hard question 
to answer because I reside in this weird limbo between immigrant and first generation — the half generation, if you will — so it’s like I don’t belong in one particular place. Moving back means family and a stronger tie to my Filipino self. But moving back also means the potential loss of American friendships and everything I’ve built here. There’s a bit of a language barrier, there’s definitely a cultural barrier, but I think the biggest barrier is because I haven’t lived in the Philippines since I was six.
As I get older, it’s getting harder and harder to remember what living there was like. I 
only have a few memories, like the day my great-grandmother passed away or the day my brother was born. I remember the view of the Wack Wack golf course outside the window in my parents’ room. I remember the glow-in-the-dark stars on my ceiling that I’ d see every night before falling asleep. I remember the awful uniforms I’ d wear to school and the beautiful smock dresses I’ d wear on Sundays. These are details that exist in pictures, and I pore through my baby books and albums over and over so I don’t forget. The first six years of my life have a very small imprint on my brain, and the imprint gets smaller as I make space for newer experiences. 
I think all I can do, right now, is keep the imprint from disappearing completely. I know 
I’m not the only person out there who’s had the experience of immigrating and assimilating, and my advice for those who feel the way I do is to find things — be it food, a community, a class — that remind you of where you came from. Whenever I’m home, I always ask my mom to make me tinola or nilaga, two of my favorite soups. I’m part of Kaibigang Pilipino here at UC San Diego and that very much gives me the Filipino “family” aspect, especially with the kuya/ate/ading program they have. I love that UCSD offers Tagalog classes and I’m hoping to take one before I graduate. 
The Philippines will always have a special place in my heart, no matter where the future 
takes me. I’ve built a huge part of my identity around being Filipino, and I wouldn’t change 
anything about that. I think the most important thing I’ve had to remember all these years, 
dear readers, is that even though I’ve moved away, it doesn’t mean I have to move on. 
Until the next adventure, 
Annika   
Note from the author: Thank you for coming with me on this journey! I hope it has 
been as exciting and eye-opening for you as it has been for me. If anything in this column resonated with you, please feel free to email me at lifestyle@ucsdguardian.org. I’ d love to

By Annika Olives, Lifestyle Editor
Horoscopes
Welcome back from break, Astro-lovers! I hope you all had a wonderful 
Thanksgiving and celebrated in the joy that only family and love can give you. 
Alas, we are back at school, and you already know that the stars have some things to say. Make sure to check them out and read below. I also added some gift ideas that would be ideal for each sign; just something to keep in mind!
Aries
Though you are definitely one to enjoy a social scene, this has been tiring 
you lately. It is time for a break. Try meditating and looking inward to uncover 
some hidden truths within yourself. Y ou never know what you will find!
Gift idea: Incense and a candle
Taurus
Taurus, you have felt foolish recently, but don’t let this get you down. Your 
stable earth sign qualities will help you bounce back and have you owning the world again. Remember that it is OK to not always feel OK, allow yourself to 
feel.
Gift idea: A poetry book
Gemini
Feelings of intense pressure may be put upon you right now, Gemini, but do 
not fret. Worrying will only prevent you from overcoming this obstacle. Focus 
on what you have to do, make a plan, and stick to it.
Gift idea: A massage gift card
Cancer
Cancer, the colder weather may further exacerbate your homebound 
tendencies, but try stepping out of your comfort zone. Maybe go see holiday lights or ice skate with a friend. Home will always be there for you to come back to, so live a little!
Gift idea: A jacket
Leo
Always the life of the party, you are often perceived as fun and joyous, Leo, 
however, you have been going through a bit of a tougher time lately. Though people expect you to be happy, remember that you do not have to be anything.
Gift idea: A box of Belgium chocolates
Virgo
Something important is coming up soon, and it has been weighing down 
upon you heavily, Virgo. As someone who usually has everything under control, this should not be a big deal, but it is stressing you out. Take a deep breath, and remember that you are capable of handling this.
Gift idea: A new calendar (and a lot of moral support)Libra
Libra, a personal struggle has made itself obvious lately, and yes, it sucks, 
but on behalf of everyone, stop projecting! You are so used to helping others that you find it difficult to accept help. Y our friends only want to help you, so let them.
Gift idea: A nice dinner out (sushi, perhaps?)
Scorpio
A good thing is presenting itself to you, Scorpio, but you are apprehensive to 
accept it; it seems almost too good to be true. Scorpio, you must allow yourself to have and experience finer things. Do not let fear ruin the possibility of happiness. Y ou deserve this.
Gift idea: Anything designer
Sagittarius
Time to celebrate, Sagittarius! It is finally your season, and yes, we all know 
that you have been waiting forever. This season has incredible things in store for you, so do not let anyone rain on your parade. Have fun and own this season.
Gift idea: An album of pictures of just them
Capricorn:
Capricorn, you are usually not very emotionally expressive, but recently, 
relationship-related issues have been on your mind, and your friends can tell, too. For once, you cannot stop talking about how you feel (it feels good to get it all out, am I right?). Embrace this!
Gift idea: A blind date
Aquarius
A recent experience has had a profound effect on you, Aquarius. It has 
pushed you to think outside of your normal mindset and has made you more observant and grateful even. Do not let this experience easily pass; remember and learn from it.
Gift idea: Their favorite album on vinyl
Pisces
Pisces, you may be struggling to make things work, but nonetheless, you are 
doing it. Continue this streak and stay focused on your goals. In the upcoming 
weeks, this will all pay off and inconveniences that once caused you stress will 
fade.

influenced rhythm and blues
singer, Danie l Caesar, per forme d
at the Sta ge Room here on our ver y own
UC San Die go campus. He has built quite
the on line followin g and has co llaborate d
with several up-and-comin g artists like Kali
Uchis, H.E.R. , and BadBadNotGoo d. The
sold-out venue was over flowin g with lively 
and excite d Danie l Caesar fans. T he sma ll
space allowed for an intimate feel; althought
here were a lot of students cramme d into
the space, t he crow d remaine d sma ll due 
to s pace constraints. Nonet heless, t he
audience was en dlessly festive an d convivia l.
The openin g artist, Snoh Aale gra, started 
the show wit h some jazzy tunes. Aa legra is a
Swedish singer based in Los An geles w hose
singing style is sou lful, simi lar to t hat of 
Amy Winehouse. The band members were
as harmonious wit h their music as t hey werein demeanor; frequent ly looking over at one
anot her w hile smi ling and bobbing their
heads. W hen Danie l Caesa r ca me u p to t he
stage, he prompt ly kicked off the show wit h
some tracks , most of which are from his
newest album, “Freudian, ” released in Au gust
earlier this year. Caesar’s soun d is rhythmic
and sou lful with a touc h of R&B, but his
lyrics also carry a powerful messages aboutlove. His band consists of a ke
yboardist, a
drummer, a guitarist, an d a bassist; a ll of 
which were happily boppin g along as t hey 
played — you cou ld tell they were feeling
it. Des pite the technical difficulties with the 
soun d, and Caesar’s occasiona l aloofness,
the audience was su pportive an d enthusiastic
from start to finish. Not to su ggest t hat he
seeme d apathetic, but he cou ld have in fused 
his performance with more energy. His
band mem bers, on t he ot her hand, were
muc h more lively during the per formance. At the risk of angering his fans, I have to
say that he was not exact ly the showman I
was expectin g. Daniel Caesar was less audible
than his band, and althou gh his band was
very entertainin g, his voice was drowne d out
by the instruments. Y ou cou ld barely hear his 
voice in the front row , much less in the back.
Althou gh I am a fan of his work, I don’t feel
that we rea lly got to see how ta lented he tru ly 
is. T his is not to sa y that his son gs are not 
amazin g, it just means t hat he didn’t execute 
them in a way t hat allowed us to see t heir full
potentia l. He did not intro duce his band, and
he did not exact ly give o ff the impression
that he was en joying himse lf, which I think 
is important w hen per formin g live. A newer
fan mi ght have felt a bit unwelcome after
being encoura ged to sin g along to his old
songs and man y references to his older, less
popu lar son gs. On one son g, he wante d
only older fans to sing along with him. For a newer fan, such as myself, who wanted to
experience his music or ot hers w ho ma y have
come to hear him per form, it seeme d like a
show for super-fans rather than all fans. I do 
think it is a little bit unfair to his su pporters,
because the y paid mone y to see him live, and
I don’t t hink their ex pectations were met. 
At t he en d of the ni ght, ever ybody 
who was t here seeme d to rea lly enjoy 
themselves. Even thou gh the show didn’t
run as smoot hly as expecte d, his screamin g
fans seeme d to in dicate t hat they enjoyed it
all the same. A fter comp leting the set, t he
talented Danie l Caesar in dulged his chanting 
fans wit h one more son g. He brought the 
show to a close b y singing “Get Y ou” of f 
of his “Freudian” album, while ever yone 
in the au dience san g along to t he lyrics.

12     THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , DECEMBER 4, 2017 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG A&E
In the wake of unseen hardships and a cancelled summer tour in 2016, Walk 
the Moon went on hiatus and spent time apart. This break allowed the four-man group to reconsider its direction. After its hit 2014 release, “Shut Up and 
Dance, ” Walk the Moon’s entire identity and success became synonymous with feel-good pop hits with an ‘80s-inspired twist, yet the group wanted to more than one viral success.
Released Nov. 10   of this year, “What if Nothing” marks the band’s fourth and 
most ambitious album yet. It offers a list of tracks that venture into the unknown, exploring genres and practicing rhythms quite unlike the band’s characteristic keyboard and synth-infused dance music. 
“What if Nothing” begins with “Press Restart, ” and the initial sound alone is 
enough to catch past listeners off-guard and to make them wonder, “Is this really Walk the Moon?” Initially promising, the suspense drops right when a choppy second verse hits after the chorus, introducing a fumbling drum beat, zippy synth, and uncharacteristic ad-libs. It’s jarring, to say the least.
“Headphones” follows, its sound similar to the hiss and crackle of an amp 
increasing in volume. It crescendos, drawing on building drumbeats and invoking a new, rock-like sound unexplored by the band before — but it cuts off suddenly with arguably the cringiest lyrics on the album entirely: “I can take a beating like a good pair of headphones / I can take a hit like Karate Kid. ” The lively mood ends there. While the instrumental is plenty dynamic, it isn’t enough to save a track riddled by misplaced guitar solos, borderline embarrassing lyrics, and wannabe-punk vocals.
The first single released, “One Foot, ” provides interesting vocal choices with 
electro-funk influences and a solid chorus, but it isn’t infectious enough to be deemed catchy. This brings up an issue that pervades the rest of the album.
A common problem plagues the middle tracks: a lack of memorability. Walk 
the Moon traverses through the experimental as the album plays on, but it ends up reaching for far too many different sounds. The wild instruments clash, sounding cacophonous at times, and the constant style changes err less on genre-bending and more on massive disorganization; the listener is merely dragged along for the disorientingly muddled ride. 
Thankfully, a glimpse of cohesiveness emerges like a bittersweet hallelujah 
nearing the last four tracks. 
“Feels Good To Be High” feels as if the band has finally stopped grasping for 
straws and decided on a single sound. Both groovy and mellow, the song’s well-placed synth reverbs and relaxed vocals makes it an easy and enjoyable listen. “Can’t Sleep” utilizes a sweet guitar riff and well-timed chord progressions alongside the final lyrics, “But these wolves they keep on scratching at my heart / And I still can’t sleep” before it wistfully drifts off to a close. “In My Mind” begins with a lively synth beat before suddenly introducing traditional instruments, but in this case, the unexpected transition successfully maintains the song’s flow.
Finally, the last song, “Lost In The Wild, ” details a classic youth narrative. Free, 
uplifting, and hopeful, the mood is reminiscent of “We Are the Kids, ” but the song presents the whimsicality of adolescence under a more mature lens. It cultivates the band’s past sound into something substantial, ending the album on a positive note.
Though the album is an exhaustive listening experience, it signifies changing 
times ahead. The waiting period for Walk the Moon’s next album can only be called a transitional period. Hopefully, the band can expand upon the album’s last tracks and hone in on a sound fully representative of its new identity.
The upside? The album definitely plays better on the second run-through.

UC San Diego vs Cal State San 
Bernardino
On Thursday evening, the UC 
San Diego women’s basketball team 
opened up its California Collegiate 
Athletic Association season at 
RIMAC Arena against Cal State San Bernardino, coming away with a 65–43 win. It was the perfect start to the conference season, as 
the Tritons had come o ff a loss the 
previous weekend. Hopefully, the 
win will give the team con fidence 
and momentum going forward. 
The matchup quickly became 
one-sided in favor of UCSD as it dominated in all facets of the game. The Tritons were led by sophomore 
forward Mikayla Williams with her third double-double of the season, tallying 16 points and 11 rebounds. Junior guard Joleen Yang added 13 points on four-of- five shooting, 
including three-of-four from three-point land. 
UCSD ended the night shooting 
38.2 percent from the field and a 
solid 42.9 percent shooting from three-point land. Defensively, the Tritons did a terri fic job, holding 
the Coyotes to under 50 points off of 35.2 percent shooting. Cal 
State San Bernardino could not get anything to fall from beyond the 
arc, only managing to make one 
shot out of 10 from the three-point line. A fter the game, UCSD head 
coach Heidi VanDerveer told the 
Athletics Department, “I thought we 
came out and really established our defensive identity. ” That defensive 
identity was de finitely felt by the 
Coyotes throughout the night, as 
they struggled to get anything going 
offensively. 
The Tritons had a 16–10 lead that 
more than doubled by the half to 32–18. The dominance continued in the 
third quarter as UCSD only allowed Cal State San Bernardino to score 
six points, increasing UCSD’s lead 
to 29. In the fourth quarter, the lead increased to 32 points as the Tritons cruised to their first conference win 
of the season. 
UC San Diego vs Cal State San Marcos
The UC San Diego women’s 
basketball team took on Cal State San Marcos on Saturday, Dec. 2 in its second California Collegiate Athletics Association game of the year. The Tritons outshot the 
Cougars, 47.6 percent to 41.5 percent, and attained an 81–63 
victory.
Senior forward Dalayna Sampton 
led the charge from the start as she 
kicked o ff the game with a layup 
within the first minute. The Cougars 
kept the Tritons close during the beginning of the quarter, making shots to tie the game at 2–2, 4–4, and then 5–5.
However, Sampton would not 
be stopped and continued to push through the defense to score the Tritons’ first 11 points of the game. 
With layups and rebounds by 
Sampton and senior guard Taylor 
Tanita, UCSD managed to plow ahead, ending the quarter 19–12.
The Cougars started the second 
quarter with a spark as they scored two free throws and a layup to bring the score to 16–19. The Tritons 
quickly stomped on any hopes, and three steals by junior guard Kayla 
Sato helped keep UCSD on the 
offensive.
The Tritons capitalized on 
opportunities, including a three-
pointer by junior guard Marcella 
Hughes with four minutes le ft in 
the half. The Cougars gave up seven 
fouls and UCSD scored six free-throws within the last two minutes, 
finishing the half ahead at 43–26. 
The third quarter provided 
yet another instance of Triton dominance. Two steals by Sato, a 
steal by junior guard Joleen Yang, 
and a block by Sampton kept the 
Cougars at bay, and Hughes and Yang each sank a three-pointer to keep the Tritons ahead. 
Although the Cougars managed 
to score the last six points of the third quarter, early layups from 
Sampton and Kato and continuous 
shots throughout the quarter allowed UCSD to remain ahead and end the quarter, 63–46.
The Cougars made another 
attempt to push their luck with two three-pointers in the first two 
minutes of the fourth quarter, followed quickly by a timeout. Cal 
State San Marcos slowly climbed 
the scoreboard, moving the lead to a 10-point di fferential, 66–56, with six 
minutes le ft in the game.  
However, UCSD remained 
steady throughout the quarter with continuous o ffensive attempts and 
quickly took over the scoreboard once again. A three-pointer by 
senior guard Paige Song and key 
baskets by Sato allowed the Tritons to further increase their lead until the final buzzer ended the game, 
81–63.
UCSD women’s basketball is 
currently 6–2 overall and 2–0 in CCAA conference play. The Tritons 
will face o ff against Cal State Los 
Angeles in a home game at 5:30 p.m. on Friday, Dec. 8.

UC San Die go became 
the talk of the town as
it acce pted a n  i n v i t a t i o n  t o  e n t e r
the Bi g West Con ference, a long-
awaited confirmation to officially 
become a Division-I universit y. After 
success fully obtainin g outstan ding
student a pproval of a re ferendum in
May 2016, t he Big West denied thefirstbid and rejected the request, crus hing 
the hearts of numerous advocates o f 
the movement. 
However, with the constant push
from UCSD’s chancellor Pradee p
Khosla , Director of Athletics 
Earl Edwards , and several other
authoritative mem bers, the Division-I
progression became a rea lity.
The Big West Con ference a lready 
consists o f multiple fellow Universit y 
of California institutions, giving UCSD 
even more o f a reason to join t he
competition, both academicall y andathletica lly. The con ference jumpe d
from a tota l of nine teams inc luding 
UC Davis , UC Irvine , UC Riversi de,
UC Santa Bar bara, Universit y of 
Hawaii at Manoa, CSU Lon g Beac h, 
Cal Poly Pomona, CSU Nort hridge,
and CSU Fu llerton , to a tota l of eleven
with the addition o f UC San Die go and
CSU  Bakersfield.
It’s been a long time comin g
for t he universit y, initia lly openin g
as a Division-III institution.The
transition to Division-I wi ll require
a gradual increase in stu dent fees, the main reason for any controvers y 
amidst the advancement. As o f now , 
the Interco llegiate At hletics fee rests
at about $134 each quarter or $402
per year wit hout inc luding summer
school.The rise in cost will take place 
over t hree years, eventua lly increasin g
by $289 per quarter. The ho pe is to
provide the athletics departmentwith an additional $10 million a 
year 
in order to live u p to the Division-I
standards and com pete with our rivals 
in all cate gories.

UC San Die go vs. Ca l State San 
Bernar dino
In its first Ca lifornia Co llegiate
Athletic Association conference
game, t he UC San Die go men’s
basketball team rallied late in the 
fourt h for a 77–71 victory. Wit h
this victor y, the Tritons improve to
4–3 overall and start offstrong in ff
conference p lay.
The Tritons starte d off the ff first 
half slowly, falling to a 0–9 deficit 
until junior guard Christian Ba yne
laid in a basket  for the Tritons’first 
points. The basket seemed to jump -
start the Tri ton offense, as UCSDffff
scored ei ght strai ght unanswered 
points followin g Bayne’s layup. The 
score c hanged hands mu ltiple times
from t hat point on, wit h neit her
team able to pull too far ahead.
Goin g into t he half, the score was
in Cal State San Bernardino’s favor ,
33–34.
The secon d half began in a 
similar fashion to the first: U CSD 
started off slow and clawed its way ffout of a deficit.The Tritons found
themselves down 10 points earl y 
in t he half; however, t hey turne d
on the offensive pressure, closing ffff
the gap an d securin g a 56–55 lead
courtes y of a Ba yne’s three-pointer.
With the game so c lose, t he Tritons
called on so phomore forwar d Scott
Everman, w ho san k two tri ples 
from downtown to keep UCSD
ahead. Undeterred , Cal State San 
Bernardino pressed the attack and 
kept the game close until the last
minute o f regulation. Wit h the 
Coyotes at their heels, the Tritons
dug deep and relied on clutch
shootin g by Bayne, who scored si x 
points in t hefinal two min utes.
With the hard-fou ght victor y 
under their belt , the Tritons looked 
next toward Cal State San Marcos .

Last Fri day, the UC San Die go

defeatin g Ca l State San Marcos 
78–66. With this victor y, the Tritonsrose to 5–3 in overall record and
maintain an undefeated record (2 –
0) in con ference p lay.
Through t he first half,
momentum flip-flopped between
the two teams. Four minutes into t he
half, it seeme d as if the Cou gars were
going to run awa y with the game,
scorin g eight unanswere d points,
taking their lead to nine (8–17). 
However, a pair o f free t hrows by 
senior forwar d Mic hael Shoema ker
enlivened the Tri ton offense. ffff The 
Tritons went on a tear ,flipping t he
script on the Cou gars, to go ahead
by nine points (30–21). But just as
momentum seemed to turn in the 
Tritons’ favor , it flippe d back in 
favor o f the Cou gars. B y the en d of 
the half, Cal State San Marcos was
able to reclaim a small, one-point
lead (35–36 ).
In t he secon d half, Tritons
took contro l of the game an d had
a dominant performance. After 
allowin g the Cou gars to score t he
first points of the half, the Tritonstook the lead and never gave it up. 
In this half, UCSD showed itself to
be the su perior team; t he Tritons 
recorded better percenta ges in
shooting behind the arc, insi de the
arc, and from the free-throw line. Wit
h this dominance , the Tritons
coaste d to a 78–66 victor y.
UCSD’s a bility to score off
turnovers was key to t he team’s 
victor y — the Tritons generated

Junior guard Christian Ba yne had
an exceptiona l game, recor ding a
game- high 24 points, two assists,
