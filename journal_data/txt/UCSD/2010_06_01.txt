The A.S. Council passed an 
expanded version of its 2010–11 budget last Wednesday, 
which heavily increased diversity and athletics allocations from the draft  originally proposed  by A.S. President 
Wafa Ben Hassine and Vice President of Finance and Resources Andrew 
Ang. 
This tempo-
rary budget will be in effect until Week Three of Fall Quarter, when the coun-cil will finalize all  allocations and distribute any remaining funds. 
Since the 
approved bud-get allocates more money 
than  the original draft, the amount the council has not yet reserved — to be finalized Fall Quarter — has dropped from $219,505.09 to $194,549.63.
According to Ang, the most conten-
tious addition to the A.S. budget was the inclusion of the new  Winter Comedy event, proposed by Vice President of Student Life Kristina Pham and newly

Not every story ends 
happily ever after. The UCSD baseball team’s incredible season came 
to a heartbreaking end on Saturday, as the No.1-ranked team in Division-II fell 6-4 to No. 9 University of Southern Indiana. 
The Tritons seemed unstoppable 
after taking their first three games at the College World Series, held in Cary, N.C., from May 22 to May 29. However — poised to top off what was perhaps the best year in pro-gram history with a national title — UCSD was stopped just short by the Southern Indiana Screaming Eagles.

AS PER USUAL By Dami Lee
TWO COKES SHORT By Sam Pelle
elected Associate Vice President of 
Concerts and Events Brian Wong. Pham and Wong requested $30,000 to fund the project, a replacement of the annual WinterFest concert — an event that was discontinued two years ago.
“We’ d like to bring a comedy fes-
tival to our events, just to have some-thing nice in the winter, ” Wong said at the meeting. “It’s also a mix-up of FallFest and Sun God. ”
Though she approved them all, Ben 
Hassine expressed reservations about the additional allocations.
“I’m really worried that we might 
be spending a little too much within our own offices,  and I just feel like, 
especially with office of Concerts and Events, [it] takes up a lot of funding that we can look at little more, ” Ben Hassine said.
Though Pham’s comedy event was 
added as a line item, the council did not guarantee it any specific amount of funds. According to Ang, funding for the event will be drawn from man-date reserves — the council’s backup fund supply — during the Fall Revise process.  He added that the event will be a one-time trial; if it is successful, it may be  may be more permanently integrated into to the 2011–12 budget. 
The council also increased funding 
for diversity projects from an originally proposed $300 to $1,000. 
AVP of Diversity Affairs Alyssa 
Peace said she requested more money in order to hold events during Welcome Week. Because the tempo-rary budget is good through  Week Three of Fall Quarter, she would not have been able to hold events otherwise. 
“Kristina [Pham] and I haven’t 
planned what our Welcome Week pro-gram will be, but we’re thinking some-thing on Library Walk in conjunction with the Cross-Cultural Center that shows students what resources are available to them, ” Peace said. 
Similarly, the athletics allocations 
increased from $3,000 to $9,650 at the request of AVP of Athletic Relations Pauline Nuth. 
Nuth said she requested the 
increase in order to fund sum-mer outreach programs — such as working with orientation leaders to encourage athleticism and game 
attendance. 
“Last year, the full line item for 
athletic relations [was $24,000], so $3,000 was really low — even just for Fall Quarter, ” Nuth said. 
In addition, A.S.-distributed U.S. 
Grants were expanded to $22,500 from the original $7,500 because the former AVP of College Affairs requested the entire year’s alloca-tion, instead of just up to fall quarter. According to Ang, U.S. Grants are scholarships students can request for research projects they are working on with faculty. 
The allocation to the UC Student 
Association was increased from $8,000 to $10,000 because Vice President of External Affairs Michael Lam is trying to mobilize 50 students to attend the UCSA Congress, usual-ly held in March, at $200 per student. 
Ang said he was satisfied with the 
revised increases to the budget. 
“We would have made most chang-
es anyway during Fall Quarter, so I’m pretty OK with the changes, ” Ang said.

The malicious car that murders 
its driver — a la Stephen King’s 
“Christine” — used to be mere urban 
legend. However, the high-tech auto-mobiles of tomorrow could make the nightmare a modern-day reality. 
Digitized vehicles — which 
include features like anti-lock brakes, automatic seatbelts and automatic door locks — are becom-ing increasingly popular. Because of this, a research group including computer-science graduate student Steve Checkoway is concerned that computer hackers may be able to gain remote access to such vehicles. The more wireless network technol-ogy advances, the more gateways for remote access will open for hackers to exploit.
“ As cars become more connected 
to the outside world, the attack surface will increase, ” Checkoway said. 
To test the possibilities of remote 
manipulation, researchers developed CarShark — a software program that observes, takes apart and inserts code, into car computers. This way, they can test how easy it will be for unauthorized individuals or technol-ogy, to command a car’s functions. 
“[CarShark] was written by us to 
interact with the various computers in the car, ” Checkoway said. “It was developed incrementally, adding functionality as the need arose. ”
To test  CarShark, the researchers 
connected a digitized car to a laptop. Another laptop was used to wire-lessly link and control the original laptop running CarShark — enabling the hacker to remotely access the vehicle’s many functions. 
Initially, the researchers thought 
they would have to locate specific vulnerable points before hacking the car. However, they were able to adjust the car’s functions simply by insert-ing random codes into the car to see how it would affect the system. If the computer systems had been secure, the insertion of random codes would not have affected the car in any way. The results demonstrated that computer-ized cars are insecure — extremely easy to damage and attack. 
The extent of potential manipula-
tion ranged from mere annoyances — such as unlocking all doors or popping the trunk — to more imme-diate danger, like killing the engine. 
According to Checkoway, execut-
ing this type of attack would requires a high level of computer proficiency in a field most hackers are still unaware of. Checkoway stressed that current vehicles currently on the market do not yet have the techno-logical features to be at risk  — the research was performed on future generations of automobiles, which will rely on digital technology as 
their main source of control.
“We don’t believe that car own-
ers should be overly concerned at this time, ” Checkoway said. “The benefits of having modern, com-puterized cars far outweigh the dangers posed by the attack. For example, anti-lock brakes, stabil-ity control, seatbelts that predict crashes and tighten preemptively and automatic notification of first responders in the event of a crash are just a few of the many benefits computerized cars offer. ”
Checkoway said it’s unlikely an 
infallible defense against car hacking will be created as there are so many possible modes for attack. He said that cars are increasingly integrated with computers, new security holes are created.
However, he added that the 
research group has informed undis-closed automobile manufacturers about the vulnerabilities of comput-erized automobiles.
“Before going public with this 
information, we disclosed the vulner-abilities to all of the relevant stakehold-ers, ” Checkoway said.“The response we received has been very positive. ”
Readers can contact Jerry To at  jto@

like anti-lock breaks make cars vulnerable to control from remote locations.

JERRY BROWN
Son to a former California governor 
— and lifted into the position himself after the Reagan regime — Democrat 
Jerry Brown was born for this stuff. 
After 40-plus years in state government, 
he is a living caricature of the steadfast lib-eral “nice guy, ” with a husky-voiced sincer-ity and track record that makes him hard to pick apart as anything but the real thing.
At this point, though, Brown’s status as 
default Sacramento nobility gives his sec-ond stab at governorship an air of sketchi-ness. He’s been too cocky to release a single game plan for the coming term, meanwhile flicking all other legitimate Democratic contenders out of the race with a lifetime of special-interest connections to back him.
Still, even if all we have to go off are 
Brown’s past accomplishments, they are groundbreaking and many.  
Brown gave the Cesar Chavez worker-
rights movement a leg up by refusing to send state troopers in to break up immigrant protests — essentially bringing agriculture into the mainstream push for labor rights. He also halted the growth of Pacific Gas and Electric, forcing the power mogul to run energy-saving cam-paigns instead of building more plants.
Of the six remaining candidates, not 
one has a scrap of Brown’s experience — nor, for that matter, a fighting chance in Monday’s Democratic primary. Immigrant rights and energy conservation are still two of the hottest issues on the table, and Brown proved to us long ago that his heart and head are in the right place regarding all that which matters most.

U.S. SENATORREPUBLICAN CANDIDATE
STEVE POIZNEROn the surface, there is little that distinguishes the Republican Party’s two leading gubernatorial 
candidates from one another: Steve Poizner and Meg Whitman are both noted business leaders, have plenty of personal wealth to bolster their campaigns and have commit-ted to slamming the other in extensive ad campaigns.
The priorities they’ve outlined so far 
aren’t too different, either. Both candidates have stated their intent to crack down on immigration reform, pursue tax cuts and reduce state spending in an effort to rem-edy California’s ailing economy. 
But a closer examination reveals that — 
while Whitman is declaredly in support of many of the same fiscal proposals touted by Poizner — she has put almost no effort into fleshing out any real plans for implement-ing and maintaining the type of budgetary reform needed to re-establish our state as a sustainable economic powerhouse. 
Poizner, on the other hand, has spent 
much of his campaign honing a well-defined, step-by-step plan to boost internal revenue and cut from California’s bloated state bureaucracy. His most notable pro-posal — a 10 percent across-the-board tax cut that would reduce personal income tax and state sales tax — is a bold move designed to stimulate individual spending in California’s darkest financial hour. 
Though it’s pretty shortsighted to slash 
from two of the state’s most important revenue sources, Poizner at least has a plan. The way Whitman’s running her campaign, there’s no telling what she might do if she snatches the governor’s seat.
Aside from his irrationally conserva-
tive budget proposal, Poizner shows a few other red flags. He’s a staunch proponent of harsh immigration regulations. He’s said he would dramatically limit access to public universities for illegal aliens, and recently declared his support for Arizona’s iron-fisted new immigration laws. 
Poizner has also shown himself to be 
more of a social conservative than he’ d like the state’s left-leaning voter base to think, supporting California’s ongoing ban on gay marriage and opposing marijuana legalization. 
It won’t be social issues that define the 
Republican primary race, though. With the state economy in shambles and a legisla-ture incapable of forging any effective solu-tions, the candidate who comes out on top is going to be the one who demonstrates clear ideas for how to whip California back into shape. In that respect, Poizner is our man.
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE
TOM CAMPBELL
*SPECIFIC TO
SAN DIEGO COUNTYTom Campbell’s strengths lie in his thoughtfulness and experi-
ence. Though his fiscally conservative proposals to curb federal spending may not make for the fastest path to economic recovery, we can rest assured that — given his academic and political experience — they are at least informed enough to transcend cheap bids for support.
More importantly, his surprising 
support for the right to abortion and gay marriage suggests he is more concerned with expanding social lib-erties than pushing a moral agenda. He may still want to throw his weight behind privatized medical care and the construction of a physical barrier along California’s border with Mexico 
— overly simple suggestions to com-
plex problems — but overall, he’s less extreme on social issues than main Republican contender and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. 
Fiorina has proven quite the 
staunch conservative: She not only wants to keep the Guantanamo Bay prison in business, but is responsible for what is quite possibly the most 
absurd campaign attack ad of all 
time (Google “Tom Campbell wolf in sheep’s clothing”). We’ll stick with the lesser of two Republicans, thank you very much. DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE
BARBARA BOXER
Now gunning for her fourth term as senator, it’s become increas-
ingly clear that Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) has gotten a little too com-fortable in her legislative high chair. 
Though she’s been a steadfast 
advocate for key progressive poli-cies like environmental regulation, educational reform and the right to choose, she’s never been the most 
creative or dynamic state leader. Her 
careful record as senator indicates she’s likely to follow whatever new plan her Democratic counterparts come up with next rather than pur-sue an issue relevant to her constitu-ents.Regardless, Boxer’s only oppo-
nent — Slate Magazine blogger and 
political author Robert “Mickey” 
Klaus — is a long-shot contender for the Democratic nomination. Though we feel there’s always a need to challenge a politician who’s offered little in the way of flexible or energetic leadership, Klaus has yet to demonstrate any ability to transform from pensive writer to swift politi-cian. 
So, with a bit of reluctance, we 
offer our endorsement to Boxer. Come general-election season, no matter her Republican opponent, Boxer will be as good as it gets.LIEUTENANT GOV.

OPINION TUESDAY , JUNE 1, 2010  THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 
YES ON PROPOSITION 13
This has been a particularly lethal 
year in earthquake history — 
and our famously fault-lined state should take heed. 
That’s why Proposition 13 — 
probably the least contentious mea-sure on the ballot — is both timely and necessary. Currently, after a building is renovated for seismic safety, its property value (and tax) can be reassessed after 15 years. Though lawmakers may exempt certain buildings from this time limit to encourage property owners to sure up their structures, those renovators who are not exempt still face a spike in property taxes once the 15-year limit is up. 
Prop. 13 would eliminate all 
time limits, so that renovations relating to earthquake safety would only affect a building’s property value after it has changed owner-ship. Most importantly, it would encourage property owners to make their buildings more earth-quake resistant. If you want to slim your chances of being caught in a dilapidated brick building next time the floor starts trembling, vote ‘Y es’ on 13. It’s only a matter of time before the big one hits.
It’s no secret: Special interests command California’s electoral 
system. Outside campaign contri-butions of up to $600 million make most politicians into the servants of powerful unions and corpora-tions — rather than the voters who place them in office. 
Proposition 15 is a small step 
toward eliminating this all-powerful and abusive system. The measure would strike down California’s ban on public financing of elections, instead starting up a pilot program to offer funds to candidates running for secretary of state, and eventually other offices, if things work out.
Best of all, the funds would be 
raised by charging Capitol lobby-ists — not taxpayers themselves — additional fees for their exploits. Though it is a tentative move toward making our election system a bit more honest — and still limited to just one office — the measure would offer voters a glimpse at what poli-tics could look like once the grip of special interests is loosened and can-didates are beholden to the public. Smaller, less wealthy hopefuls would at least have a fraction of a chance.
Unfortunately, the measure 
provides for little oversight on how the candidates could spend the money they receive — potentially allowing for improper use of pub-lic funds. But campaign finance reform has to start somewhere, and Proposition 15 is a budge in the right direction.
WHAT 13 WOULD DO
Encourage property owners to make 
their buildings earthquake-resistant by offering them a tax break.
WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE ‘YES’The safety-first measure is the closest thing to a no-brainer on the primary ballot.
Proposition 14 is an ambitious 
dreamer of an initiative. It aims 
to disintegrate the crippling par-tisanship in state politics that has bogged down the legislative process in California for far too long.  
The way our primary system 
functions, only those voters who are registered as Democrats or Republicans (or who request a ballot from either party in advance) are eligible to participate in the election — causing candidates to reach out to supporters at the most extreme poles, who are generally more likely to show up for the first round. 
Proposition 14 would change all 
that. Instead of receiving separate ballots, all voters — regardless of party affiliation — would make their choices on a long list of all the candidates. The two who received the most votes would advance to the general election.
While some proponents of 
the measure — such as Sen. Abel Maldonado (R-Santa Maria) — assert it would bring about the end of fractional partisan politics, it’s hardly that kind of definitive cure-all. Political allegiances won’t disappear anytime soon, nor will incessant partisan bickering.
What Proposition 14 could do, 
though, is still worth noting: The measure would involve more swing voters in the preliminary stages of the race, requiring politicians to reach out beyond their most loyal bases if they wish to advance. 
In the end, we support any effort 
to democratize our election system, regardless of any freak upset it may cause down the line.
SAN DIEGO  
INITIATIVES
Staunch environmental-ists might not be thrilled 
at the prospect of digging out another landfill, but Proposition A — which would allow for the construction of a new landfill and recycling center in East Otay Mesa — handles our waste prob-lem as responsibly as possible. 
The state estimates that San 
Diego County will run out of local waste space within 20 years, at which point it would become necessary to transport our trash to other counties — an expensive, unsustainable prospect that would be far more wasteful than con-structing an additional space for our refuse in a sparsely populated part of San Diego. 
It’s no wonder the San Diego chapter of the Service 
Employees International Union has rallied support for a Board of Supervisors term limit: They wish to throw out long-standing members who don’t prioritize union pay and benefits. But out-side of this special interest, a term limit would only weigh on county operations.
Just look at Sacramento. 
Legislators are whisked in and out of office so fast, they don’t have time to learn from their mis-takes — nor begin to get along. A similar situation on a local level would clog City Hall progress and ultimately limit voters’ freedom to stick with a candidate they trust.
Just like Proposition 17 — another thinly veiled piece of corporate-
interest legislation on this summer’s ballot — Proposition 16 represents capitalist interests at their ugliest. (Energy giant Pacific Gas and Elecric has thrown a reported $35 million at its ‘Y es’ campaign.) 
The measure would change 
the state constitution to require a two-thirds public vote for any local government to establish or expand another public electricity provider. 
In other words, it would cement 
PG&E’s gaping monopoly on state electricity into law. 
Of course, the initiative’s chief 
proponents would have you believe otherwise. With glossy print pro-paganda touting the measure as the “Taxpayers Right to Vote Act, ” PG&E is attempting to frame the initiative as a way to empower voters. In reality, it would create a stiff roadblock for competition in the electricity industry — thereby enabling companies like PG&E to tap customer wallets however they see fit. Not only is a two-thirds voter 
majority exceedingly hard to come by, but it’s also a losing battle for all those public electricity providers that are legally prohibited from contribut-ing to the “‘No’ on 16” campaign. 
The only empowerment that 
would result from this proposition is that of electricity giants — more than enough to justify our ‘No’ vote on Proposition 16.
Prop. 17 is an initiative of the insurance companies, by the insurance compa-
nies and for the insurance companies. 
If passed, automobile insurers will 
rake in profit by raising rates for custom-ers who haven’t had continuous coverage for the past five years.  It doesn’t matter if 
you have a perfect driving record, and it 
doesn’t matter why you were uninsured. 
Canceled to serve in the military? Higher rates. Canceled after being laid off? Higher rates. 
What if you’ve never been insured 
because you’re a carless college student? Y ou guessed it: higher rates. 
The proposition is sponsored by 
Mercury Insurance, who tried to pass a similar initiative before — and illegally 
surcharged its customers based on their 
previous history until ordered to stop in 2005. Mercury emphasizes that Proposition 
17 would benefit the 80 percent of drivers who switch insurance carriers by saving them the $250 surcharge required of new customers. The proposition’s fine print, however, reveals that Mercury intends to balance out the money consumers save — and then some — by raising premiums for everyone else. Sparing a one-time charge for the fortunate many isn’t very valuable 
when the bottom 20 percent happens to 
be financing those savings. 
What’s more, the California 
Department of Insurance estimates that if this measure passes, the amount of unin-sured drivers will increase by 20 percent. And if more people drive uninsured, the cost of insurance rises for everyone else. In the end, the only real winners here are insurance companies — and that’s where 
we call bullshit.WHAT 14 WOULD DO
Eliminate two-party primary elec-tions by introducing an all-inclusive ballot; only the top two candidates would advance.
WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE ‘YES’
It’s an admirable step toward making the primary system a little more democratic.
WHAT 15 WOULD DOProvide provisional public funding to state campaigns and levy an additional fee on lobbyist funding.
WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE ‘YES’
Candidates without financialbacking from special-interest groups might finally have a chance at a campaign.WHAT 16 WOULD DORequire approval by two-thirds of voters for a local government to use public funds to expand or create municipal  utilities.
WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE ‘NO’
This is special-interest electioneering at its ugliest.

Laren Poole has had a busy week. The 28-year-old San Diego 
native — and former UCSD student — spent last Tuesday in the Oval Office, celebrating the passage of a bill that could end the war in Uganda with President Obama. Three days later, Poole 
took off to Africa, where he will spend the next two weeks installing short-wave radio towers in the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo — currently a volatile war zone. 
Luckily for the graduating class of 2010, he’ll get back just in time for a 
keynote speech at UCSD’s All-Campus Graduation Celebration. 
Ironically, it will be his first graduation. Poole dropped out of UCSD in 
2004 to run non-profit organization Invisible Children full time. In 2003, he skipped Spring Quarter to travel to Sudan with friends Bobby Bailey and Jason Russell. After discovering hordes of children hiding from a guerilla army in Northern Uganda, the three adventurers pulled out their SEPT. 2001

You’ve met them b efore  — on  Library Walk, in class, outsid e Geisel. 
You lock eyes with them for a split secon d, reco gnizing the clip-
board and bright student-org shirt. B efore  you can escape,  they 
say the dreaded words: “H ave you pledged CALPIRG?” I n other words, 
“Would you like anot her $5 line  item  on your quarter ly eBill?”
But winnin g over student donors  isn’t the hardest part of their job. 
Since 1975,  with the help of professiona l lobby ists and attorne ys, the 
California S tudent Public Interest R esearc h Group  has undertaken causes  
ranging from  healthcare reform  to hunger and home lessness. Th ey 
petition  lawmakers, protest  at public events, l obby in Sacramento and 
Washington DC, write letters  and make phone calls to elected officia ls, as 
well as raise  awareness  in the more  imme diate communit y.
CALPIRG is an offsho ot  of U.S. PERG , and has student charters  at 
all the UC campuses except for UC Merce d, as well as at USC an d Santa  
Monica  Communit y College. All the student charters  hold a joint confer -
ence every quarter,  where they discuss  current  events, b rainstorm cam-
paign strate gies and prioriti ze which issues to focus  on for the comin g 
three mont hs. Any student can atten d, but only the executi ve committee  
— compose d of a chair, vice chair, secretar y, treasurer  and a few repre -
sentati ves, elected by stu dent mem bers of CALPIRG — h as voting power.
As with any such large-scale organization, the hot topic  of the nigh t 
is always the budget. This  Sprin g Quarter,  the bulk of CALPIRG income  
will go toward a camp aign for affor dable education;  in fall, it will most ly 
go toward a campai gn for global warmin g solutions . Accor ding to

MICHAEL  CIAGLO /GUARDIAN
See CALPIRG, page 11When I was  promote d to news 
editor in W inter Q uarter,  
I lived in a crampe d triple, 
spent  mealtimes cursin g the dining-
hall grub for tastin g like cardboard 
and had never even been to a Sun G od 
Festival. In other words, I was  a fresh-
man — b ut damne d if I w ould give 
anyone reason  to remem ber it.
Nine mont hs ago, I first  climbed 
the stairs  to the secon d floor of the old 
Student Center  
and offere d a 
writer’s applica-
tion (or four) to 
Editor in Ch ief 
Simone  Wilson. 
It was the first 
step in wh at I 
thought would 
be a four-year plan to achieve editor-
ship. Past incomin g-editor soap boxes 
are most ly variations  of “I joined on a 
whim — ne ver inten ding to be editor 
— it just happene d .”  I ’m an exception.
 Still, I ne ver inten ded for it to hap-
pen this quick ly. Nor did I ima gine 
becomin g such a loser that the lights of 
my life  were stalking the A.S. listser v, 
or landing upon  the perfect  headline. 
That said, looking back, all the signs 
of my accelerate d transformation w ere 
there. 
Only three weeks into Fall Quarter,  
I made a decision that signifies a 
point  of no return  in the Guardian . I 
remo ved my mom  from  the T-Mobile 
Fave Five.
I know, I know. It’s pathetic enou gh 
to have your mom  as one of your Fave 
Five to begin with. But it’s even w orse 
when you replace h er with the A.S. 
presid ent (at the time, U tsav Gupta ), 
who you’re calling at least three times  
a week. 
That was only the beginnin g. I h ad 
dreams  about murdering A.S. counci l 
mem bers who didn’t call me back. On 
an all-staff Las Vegas trip, I cra wled 
into a corner at 6:30 a.m. — steppin g 
over various  passe d-out  co-w orkers — to conduct an inter view and write 
a story about certain d ance  patterns  in 
honeybees. I too k on so man y stories  
that, at times, my byl ine had a near  
monopo ly on the front  page.
I spent  so little time  in my dorm  
that a housemate  starte d an “Angela 
sighting” program, wh ere he’d track 
the number of times h e saw me during 
any given mont h (four  was the record). 
I skipped a midterm  to cover a sit-in 
in the Chance llor’s 
Comp lex. I spent  
finals week going 
through six years of 
archives, reading and 
documentin g every 
single artic le into a 
90-pa ge binder — a ll 
in the name  of insti-
tutiona l memor y.
Three  quarters,  70-p lus artic les, one 
4,000-w ord epic and a glorious  slosh-
ball victor y later, I’ve had the best year 
of my life. 
But, for all that, the reality is that in 
nine mont hs, I’ve gon e  from  a nobody 
writer to next year’s editor in chief — 
meanin g I’m still sort of worrie d about 
everything I know I don ’t know.
It’s not just me. Our executi ve 
board next year will be exception-
ally young — I’ m loo king at you, 
Arielle and Ch eryl (fe llow freshmen  
who have already entere d the plan-
ning stages of Project Recruit  Older 
Staffers  to Buy Booze). A nd every 
time  we want  to turn  to Simone  for 
a tease  or Alyssa for a witty opinion 
headline, that’s going to be a disa d-
vanta ge. 
However, as hard as it’s going to 
be next year, our inexperience migh t 
also be an advanta ge. We’ll get that 
muc h better that muc h quicker, all the 
while knowing we’re all in it together 
(Unless someone  quits. Th en I’ll 
have a new target for my murderous  
dreams .)
Next year, I’ll sti ll love the bloo d, 
sweat and AP  style that goes into every issue . But the rest of this space  
is reser ved for Simone ’s telltale cough, 
Reza’s office pran ks and everyone who 
made my first year of college amazing. 
Simone,  I cou ld wax poetic  on 
how I h ave never respecte d anyone as 
muc h as I respect  you, but I’ll con vey 
my awe by saying that I sti ll distinct ly 
remem ber the one time  you rolled 
your eyes at me durin g production. (I 
put up my “I w ill work harder” check-
list the next day.) R eza and Alyssa:  
You’ve taught me some of the most  
basic tenets of Guardian life, from  the 
importance of white space to a sacre d 
duty to save the back-room  couc h. 
Emily: Though you may den y it, I 
know that if Guardian  was  a sororit y, 
you’d  be my “big” — d urin g too man y 
hours  together in the office, y ou’ve 
taught  me the most  this year, despite  
never utterin g a word about content . 
Kelsey: Your emer gency edits and 
yogurt donations  saved me durin g 
man y a production. Jenna  and Pecot: 
Thanks for keepin g Hiatus  alive, and 
lettin g me reser ve album reviews 
ahead of time . Cros key: Your suite d-
up presence  in the office was  always 
a positi ve one, and I’ll ne ver forget 
your desert-oasis speec h. Edwin: 
You’ll always have a specia l place in 
my heart for being the first (and only) 
editor  to call me back, and reintro -
ducin g me to good ‘ n’ nasty hip -hop 
in your DJ Gonzo sessions. V ishal: 
Your goofiness  and love of athlet-
ics h as given me a newfoun d love of 
sports  — and now I fina lly know the 
definition  of “sac fl y.”  Y ou also taught 
me how to fend off predators . And I 
forgive you for Vegas. I rea lly do. 
This  kind of makes me s oun d like 
a loser, b ut I have never lo ved any-
thing as muc h as I love working for 
the Guardian — and it’s a love I hope 
never goes away. Incomin g editors  of 
2010-11: W e have a lot  of living up

be one of the most  deman ding and 
rewarding years of our lives. STRAIGHT TO THE TOP , IN RECORD TIME

UCSD IS CHANGING
Financial Aid Office Summer Hours:  
Monday - Friday 10:30 am to 4:30 pm.All current and new borrowers (students and parents) 
will need to sign a new Master Promissory Note for the Direct Loan program funds.hi-def handycams to film “Invisible Children: 
The Rough Cut. ” 
The documentary gained international 
attention in 2006, shedding light on the rebel army’s practice of abducting of child soldiers. At that point, finishing his degree wasn’t exactly the top of Poole’s to-do list. Instead, he shifted his attention to promoting awareness through a successful nonprofit organization, and facilitating an end to the conflict in Northern Uganda.
 “I’m kind of playing it by ear, ” Poole said. “If 
we stop this war, then I’m going to re-evaluate where my life goes next. ”
The rebels, who call themselves the Lord’s 
Resistance Army and advocate the overthrow of the Ugandan government, are led by gue-rilla fighter Joseph Kony. The army has been operating out of Northern Uganda since 1987.
In an attempt to build the army, LRA 
members — including children who have already been abducted and brainwashed — steal other children from their homes, force them to commit murder and convert them into soldiers. Often, the abductees’ first victims are their own parents — a strategy employed by the LRA so that the children will have no family to which they can return. 
In order to avoid this fate, thousands of 
children swarm into less isolated cities every night, sleeping in public places with only a thin mat to protect them from the bus-sta-tion and hospital floors beneath them. When Poole, Bailey and Russell stumbled across one such scene, they began to document what they soon realized was a virtually un-talked-about issue outside of the area.
The original “Invisible Children” has since 
evolved into its own nonprofit organization, which has held over 5,000 (and counting) film screenings at colleges and high schools around the country. They also provide aid — like microfinance opportunities and schol-arships — to help improve education and income rates in Uganda. Not bad for a boy from La Mesa who started out making skate-board videos in his backyard.
Poole said he was not expecting to return 
home from his 2003 Africa adventure with such a gruesome story to tell. “I didn’t really volunteer, or anything, ” 
Poole said. “I was just going on this crazy adventure to South Africa to shoot some kind of film — I didn’t know what. Very, very humble beginnings. When I tell people, they expect me to say that, like, I wanted to be like Mother Theresa or something. And I was far from Mother Theresa. ”
Prior to his somewhat spontaneous trip 
to Sudan, Poole’s only journey outside the country had been a family spearfishing trip to Mexico, and the decision to head to Africa came as something of an accident. While working for Jedediah Clothing Company, Poole was commissioned to put on a promo-tional parade for the fashion company’s fall line. When short notice and a lack of funding got the better of Poole’s patience, he yelled at his boss — soon-to-be fellow filmmaker Russell — for assigning him to a project doomed to failure. 
“I had a horrible attitude about the whole sit-
uation, ” Poole said. “So, I called two weeks after and apologized about my attitude and he said, ‘Do you want to grab coffee?’ And I said ‘Sure. ’ So Jason and I had coffee, and he said, ‘Oh, I’m going to Africa, if you want to come?’”
Initially, Poole refused. As the first in his 
family to go to college, he had only two years left before he could receive a degree in struc-tural engineering. He knew that skipping Spring Quarter of his sophomore year to run away to Africa would not sit well with his parents — not just because it would put him behind academi-cally, but because exploring Sudan would be no walk in the park. 
“My mom told me ‘No way, ’ and she started 
crying, ” Poole said. “ And my dad, who was in Vietnam, just told me, ‘No way; you’re not going to someplace like Vietnam where they hate Americans. ’ From the outside, for my parents, [Africa] looks like a huge hotbed of conflict. They were really, really scared for me. ”
With a tough decision on his hands, Poole 
said he turned to god for an answer. 
“I told my mom, ‘I just need a sign from god, 
Mom. I need a sign from god, ”’ Poole said. “ A couple weeks pretty much affirmed that I wasn’t going to go, because I didn’t receive a sign from god. I just told the guys: ‘Hey, I don’t know. I’m just not going to make a decision. Unless some-thing instrumental happens in my life, I’m not going. ’”
Russell and Bailey, however, decided to take 
matters into their own hands. One morning, months before the intended date of departure, Poole woke up to a very literal calling. 
“I got up and my car was parked outside of 
my house, and there’s a huge black plywood sign on my window that said ‘Go, ’” Poole said. “They had broken into my car, and in there was a little envelope inside. It said: ‘This is the sign. Y ou’ d better go. ’ My mom started crying immediately, because she saw my face and she knew I had made up my mind to go right there. They still haven’t told me how they broke into my car. ”
The trio set off on March 20, 2003 — the 
same day, coincidentally, the Iraq War officially began. They intended to spend a couple months filming the effects of the civil war in Sudan, after flying into Kenya and crossing the border how-ever they could.
However, they soon discovered that most of 
the Southern Sudanese people had fled across the border to Uganda — so, after a few days of filming shrubs and fighting snakes, Poole, Bailey and Russell made their way south. A woman named Jolly Okot took on the role of guide, driv-ing them to the town of Gulu — where they first spotted hundreds of children sleeping in a bus park — and helping them befriend some of the boys there.
When Poole got back, he was 60 pounds 
lighter (due to a bad case of malaria) but more than ready to piece together the hours of footage he’ d collected. In the end, though, it took them an entire year complete the documentary. 
“I was trying to tell people about this experi-
ence, but it wasn’t doing it justice, ” Poole said. “People just didn’t understand it. I didn’t blame them; it sounds like a nightmare. So then, after a year, they got to see what I’ d seen and what I’ d experienced. That was really important for me: for them to know why I’ d changed, and why I’ve committed my life to it. ”
Poole left UCSD at the end of his junior year 
to devote his time to Invisible Children, which aids African communities in their fight against the LRA. Since his original trip to Africa, Poole has returned over 20 times in hopes of captur-ing all untold stories that might remain. His current focus is on recent LRA activity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where vil-
lagers in the northeast have seen daily attacks for the past three months.
“When you flip on the news, you don’t get 
any kind of compelling stories from the rest of the world, ” Poole said. “Hollywood doesn’t focus on it. Y our everyday, average American — the only thing they hear about the rest of the world is a guilt trip asking them for money. There are some really amazing things going on, and these are really powerful sto-ries about tragedy and people overcoming all kinds of odds. I would love to find a way for those kinds of stories to meet mainstream culture. ”
A followup to “Invisible Children: The 
Rough Cut” is currently in the works. The feature-length film, which they hope to release within the year, will combine footage from the original excursion with new material shot at pro-tests and return trips. It will also add a new focus on the personal development of Poole, Bailey and Russell during their travels.
In fact, Poole said his decision to accept the 
invitation to speak at graduation was partly inspired by the personal reflection he did while putting the film together. 
“When you’re writing your own story, you 
kind of reflect on the decisions of the past, ” Poole said. “Leaving school was one of the hardest, biggest decisions of my life, so when I was called by UCSD to come speak, it just felt right — coming back and sharing what I’ve been doing for the last seven years. ” 
That doesn’t mean he’s planning on complet-
ing his degree anytime soon. The structural-engineering major — chosen in part by Poole’s father, mostly for its profitability — no longer fits into his identity as a humanitarian worker. For now, he said, the war comes first.
“I know a lot of these kids are scared 
about getting a job, and they’re wondering, ‘What am I going to be now?’” Poole said. “We need them to create their own path. We don’t need them to go work in these huge bureaucratic institutions; we need new insti-tutions, we need new ideas, new companies. I want to share that message of how it’s hard — I’ve been there — but ultimately, it’s more rewarding. This world needs trailblazers. ”

SUBWAY 
open until 1am June 6-9 onlyand outside foundations, while 80 
percent is raised through the pledge system — in which CALPIRG vol-unteers ask student passersby to fill out a pledge card that adds $5 to their quarterly bill on Tritonlink. 
“They know us as the people with 
the orange stickers, and they think that’s all we do — ask for money — but we get results, ” Warren College senior and CALPIRG Vice Chair Tania Herrera said.
The pledge system was instated 
in the late 1970s, after CALPIRG condemned various companies responsible for chemical spills — companies in which some mem-bers of the UC Board of Regents had stake. The regents decided CALPIRG could remain on UC campuses if they could convince 20 percent of the student population to pledge under contract every year. Although CALPIRG-hired campus organizer Adam Gosney declined to comment, Herrera approximated that 5,000 UCSD students pledge CALPIRG, generating roughly 75,000 dollars a year. (On average, 30,000 students pledge yearly on a statewide level.)
Another $18,750 is raised 
through grants and outside founda-tions — totaling 93,750 a year. 
UCSD’s charter divides its bud-
get so that 30 to 40 percent pays Gosney’s salary. About 55 percent is used to hire professional staff — lawyers, lobbyists, scientists and advocates — to pressure lawmak-ers and special interest groups. A remaining 5 percent goes toward overhead costs like rent and mate-rials. Students work for free — as volunteers or interns.
 “What makes us different from 
other groups — and what makes us so effective — is that we have professional staff working full time, ” said Tiffany Rezvani, Eleanor Roosevelt College freshman and media coordinator for CALPIRG’s affordable education campaign dur-ing Winter Quarter 2010.
In addition to the professional 
staff, funds also go to purchasing office space and materials like stick-ers and T-shirts.
When they aren’t fundraising, 
most CALPIRG student volunteers spend their time raising aware-ness on campus. Eight different campaigns are currently underway, including the Textbooks Campaign — which shoots to make textbooks available for free on the web — and the Public Transit Campaign, a push for more state funding toward public transit and completion of the UCSD trolley extension. 
UCSD student-volunteers trav-
eled to the Los Angeles Courthouse last October to make La Jolla Shores a protected marine area — a mea-sure that a California State Panel passed the next month. In addi-tion, in light of recent fee increases, these same volunteers have been approaching candidates for the upcoming California governor’s race at public forums, pressuring them at the podium to make con-crete statements on their plans for keeping public education affordable. 
“We’re out there giving stu-dents opportunities to act in that moment, ” Herrera said. “Whether it’s signing petitions — whether it’s making calls, writing a story or volunteering — it’s on-the-spot kind of stuff. If you see us, we’re up to something you can get involved in right there and then. ”
In CALPIRG’s quarterly intern-
ship program students commit about 10 hours a week in exchange for four course credits. There are also numerous short-term volunteer positions available. Everyone is wel-come at general body meetings, held Tuesdays at 7 p.m. in Room 203 of the Student Center. Visit www.calpirgstudents.org/ucsd for more information.

JESSICA  HSU/GUARDIAN12 THE UCSD GUARDIAN  TUESDAY , JUNE 1, 2010  NEWS
University Center administrators to present 
financial records if they continue negotiating the reduction of their rent. Representatives from the co-ops are currently in the process of renewing their space agreements with the uni-versity, which will dictate the terms of main-taining their Student Center locations.
This is not the first time the co-ops have 
gone to the council in desper-ate times. Last year, co-op rep-resentatives asked the council to carry about a $30,000 debt; their request was granted. 
In April, the co-ops asked 
University Centers to lift their obligation to pay rent com-pletely. However, administrators declined to consider the request without the presence of docu-ments detailing the expenses and the income of the co-ops. 
In response, General Store 
employee Andrew Rubens,  along with about 15 other co-op repre-sentatives, visited the council ‘s meeting on May 26 to submit the request for $15,500 — enough to hire an accountant to prepare the needed documents. Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs Jordan Taylor sponsored the request.
“We wanted there to be a face to this propo-
sition of thousands of dollars being taken from A.S., ” Rubens said. “We explained why we thought it was necessary. ”
Rubens added that the co-ops will not make 
a habit of turning to the council for help.
“We’re not going to be asking for money in 
the future, ” he said. “This is a one-time thing, to help with the process of certifying our rent agreement and making it smoother. ”
According to Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Andrew Ang, the $5,167 will come from mandate reserves — where approximately $900,000 is set aside for one-time expenses and enterprise startups.
University Centers and the co-ops will each 
pay $5,167 to cover the full $15,500 cost of an accountant. This amount was determined in a discussion between director of University Centers Paul Terzino and a local accounting firm.
Once the University Centers Advisory 
Board receives the financial statements — beginning in 2007 for the General Store and Groundwork Books, and 2008 for the Food Co-Op — it will review the documents and determine each co-ops’ need for a rent reduc-
tion. UCAB will examine how much 
each co-op can afford and how much the university is willing to subsidize.
Under an expired lease agree-
ments still in place on a month-to-month basis, rent is currently $1,450.97 for the G-Store, $521.70 for the Food Co-Op and $788.55 for Groundwork Books.
UCAB Chair Nicole Metildi 
said she is sure University Centers will try to make it easier for the co-ops to pay rent. As an alterna-tive, UCAB is considering swap-ping the General Store space with UCSD Bike Shop’s smaller space so that the General Store can pay less in rent.
“We talked about ways we can 
help them to better pay their rent, and we also talked about the co-ops really defining who they are, ” 
Metildi said.
Taylor, who was 2009-10 UCAB Chair, said 
the co-ops could benefit from redefining them-selves as student services, rather than vendors.
“What will probably be written into the 
new space agreement is a paragraph where [the co-ops] describe what they feel they are — and what fully encompasses — their operations as more than just a vendor [but also] a safe place on campus [and] as a resource of social move-ment, ” Taylor said.
At a meeting with University Centers in 
April, the co-ops stated that they don’t regard themselves to be for-profit vendors.
“They still have to pay some sort of rent 
because they’re selling stuff, ” Metildi said.
Members of the the co-ops are asking the 
A.S. Council, GSA and UCAB every quarter to touch base. According to Taylor, they also plan to create a public annual report that includes the financial expenses and current business models being used.
Metildi said she plans to meet with mem-
bers of the co-ops over summer to further dis-cuss a potential master space agreement should be finalized by the end of Fall Quarter, at which 
point the GSA and the A.S. Council will give a final OK since they represent graduate and undergraduate students who pay the university centers fee.

takes, ” head Coach Dan O’Brien said in an interview with the UCSD Athletic Department. 
The Tritons opened the week-
long tournament against Georgia College & State University, emerg-ing with a 3-2 victory thanks to a walk-off single by junior Grant Bauer. Junior Tim Shibuya threw his fifth complete game of the sea-son, striking out four to record his twelfth victory.
Late-inning drama followed the 
Tritons into their next game of the tournament — this time against University of Central Missouri. Senior righty Matt Rossman took a no-hitter into the eighth before allowing two straight doubles and giving up a run. With a 1-1 tie, the game went into extra innings — and Rossman rose to the task. He did not allow a hit the rest of the way, and junior catcher Kellen Lee drove in the winning run in the top of the 11th to capture a 2-1 victory.
In the semifinal game against 
Franklin Peirce University, junior pitcher Guido Knudson threw four and two-thirds innings of score-less baseball. Junior third baseman Evan Kehoe’s three RBIs led the offense, as the lineup combined for 13 hits and six runs in 6–3 win that led the Tritons into the cham-pionship game.
After recording seven straight 
victories in postseason play, the Tritons were in the driver’s seat of the double-elimination College World Series — having advanced through the bracket without a single loss.
Staff ace Shibuya was given the 
nod in the championship game. However, the ever-reliable junior out of Wyoming wasn’t as sharp as he had been throughout the season, yielding five runs in four innings.Still, the Tritons came out 
strong at the plate after a home run off the bat of junior outfielder Kyle Saul and an RBI double by Kehoe. But the 2–0 lead was short-lived: UCSD found itself in a hole after Southern Indiana answered back with a three-run second inning. Two throwing errors allowed three unearned runs for USI, and the Tritons trailed 3-2. 
Rossman, coming off a bril-
liant performance against Central 
Missouri just days before, entered the game to relieve Shibuya. However, Rossman showed signs of fatigue and exited after allow-ing a hit and a walk and recording just two outs. Knudson came in to quiet the USI bats, but couldn’t 
quite gain control over the Screaming Eagles, who extended their lead to 6–2.
Though the Tritons rallied in the 
eighth inning with RBIs from red-shirt freshman Danny Susdorf and junior Blake Tagmyer, two quick fly outs in the bottom of the ninth saw the Tritons down to their final out. Kehoe singled to put the tying run at the plate, but another fly ball sealed the game and handed the national title to Southern Indiana.
Senior first baseman Brandon 
Gregorich went three-for-five, Kehoe had two hits and drove in a run and Saul homered for UCSD in the loss. 
They may not have gotten their 
fairytale ending, but the Tritons played championship-caliber base-ball all season, winning 20 of their last 22 games in 2010 and finishing their season with an overall record of 54-8 — the most wins and few-est losses the UCSD baseball team has ever seen in a single season.
“We all recognize that this is 
the greatest season in the history of UCSD baseball, ” senior pitcher Kirby St. John said. “Right now it really stings, but the more time goes by the more we realize how special it was of what we were able to accomplish. ”
O’Brien said he was pleased 
with his team despite the loss. 
 “Our guys did exactly what 
they needed to do and battled to the very end, ” O’Brien said. “They stayed resilient, they stayed loose — we just didn’t get it done. I can’t tell you how proud I am of this ball club for how they go about their business day in and day out. ”
Of the eight teams invited to 
the College World Series, UCSD was the only team that had played in the 2009 tournament. And, with only nine graduating seniors, the team will set its sights on Cary, N.C, for the third straight season.
The loss hurts most for the 
seniors, but St. John said how grateful he was for the experience.
“This team is really special. ” 
St. John said. “We love hanging around together and have a lot of team chemistry, and that’s the most important thing to take out of it. ” 
Rossman echoed St. John’s sen-
timents.
“It was an awesome run, ” 
Rossman said. “ An amazing year with an even better group of peo-ple. It was definitely the best year of my life. ”

Head women’s coach Darcy Ahner 
said Fogarty impressed her all season. 
“Y ou think everyone has off-days, 
but this year, Kelly was just on all the time, ” Ahner said. 
Though Merrill set yet another 
school record in the 400-meter hurdles, she was unable to reclaim her title as national champion in the event, which she won in 2009. Her time of 58.03, however, is the fastest in UCSD his-tory — nearly a half-second faster than her winning time at the 2009 national championships in San Angelo, Texas. 
Sophomore Jacqueline Rose and 
junior Stephanie LeFever joined Merrill and Fogarty on the 1600-meter relay team, earning an eighth-place finish and garnerimg All-American honors. Their time of 3:44.39 is the second fast-est school history.
“That was probably the most nerve-
racking race I’ve ever been in, ” Fogarty said. “It was a totally different field than what we’re used to, but we still got a [season best]. ”
Senior Donna LeFever cleared 
12’2.75” in the pole vault, placing sixth in the event. The elder LeFever sister came into the meet ranked 10th, but cleared the mark on her first attempt to move up in the final standings. 
Although she came into the cham-
pionship meet ranked first in the high jump, senior Linda Rainwater’s frac-tured back impeded her from defend-ing the national title. Rainwater was given medical clearance only days before the meet, but still found herself in pain during each attempt. Still, her resilience allowed her to finish with a jump of 5’5.75” — good for 11th place.
“She did what she could, ” Ahner 
said. “It wasn’t where she was before the injury, but she did what she could and was just a few places off of All-American. She’s a gutsy, strong woman. ”
Fellow senior high jumper Casey 
Ryan also battled a nagging injury to place ninth with a mark of 6’9.50” . Other top accomplishments included Senior Daniel Anderson’s 14th place 1:51.97 finish in the 800-meter race, and junior Theresa Richards’ ninth-place 140’4” mark in the javelin throw. 
Salerno said he was happy with the 
team’s performance, especially given the caliber of competition at the meet.
“The level in Division-II has 
improved dramatically in the last five years, ” Salerno said. “There’s going to be places it doesn’t go well, but the level is just so high. I don’t think we had any disappointments. We’re coming back with nine All-Americans, and that’s really impressive. ”

See  NATIONALS, Page 15It may not have been the last of the day, but sopho-
more Nick Howe’s championship throw immedi-ately looked like a winner. With the javelin stuck in the grass 225 feet from where he stood, Howe knew no competitor would come close to beating 
his mark. It was only a matter of time before he was named national champion.
At the 2010 Division-II track and field championships 
on May 30, Howe’s accomplishment led a formidable Triton showing over the next three days in Charlotte, N.C. With his victory in the javelin throw, Howe became the first male national champion in the history of UCSD track and field. 
“He really performed like someone beyond his years, ” 
head coach Tony Salerno said. “He had a rough first throw, came back, made adjustments and made the big throw he needed to win. ”
Howe won the event by nearly six feet — a personal best 
and new school record.
But Howe wasn’t the only one to end the season with 
success. Six Tritons earned All-American honors at the meet, awarded to the top eight athletes in each event. Two were even named All-Americans in multiple events: Junior Kelly Fogarty and Senior Christine Merrill. 
Fogarty placed in the top eight in three of her four 
events, becoming the first Triton sprinter to earn All-American honors in both the 100- and 200- meter races. Her time of 11.99 seconds in the 100 earned her sixth place, while 24.04 seconds in the 200 was good for sev-
enth. Lincoln University’s Semoy Hackett, who represented 
Trinidad and Tobago at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, won both events. 
“I’m still in awe, and it still hasn’t really hit me, ” Fogarty 
said. “It’s really an honor. “[My coach] has really believed in me the whole time, so it’s nice to have the unwavering faith that I can do it. ”
