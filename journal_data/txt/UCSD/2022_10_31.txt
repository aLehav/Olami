The announcement of Ned Fulmer 
leaving the Try Guys shook the 
internet to its core. Naturally, SNL 
followed up with a skit. But did 
the comedic skit ignore the real 
issues about this alarming sexual 
misconduct in the workplace?

35,000 to 56,000 New 
Homes are Proposed to be 
Built in University City
By Tianrui Huang
/gid00020/gid00006/gid00015/gid00010/gid00016/gid00019/gid00001/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019HOUSING
A new proposal from the 
University City Planning Depart -
ment shows that University City 
is projected to add/build 35,000 to 
56,000 new houses in the upcom -
ing decades — a 215% increase in 
housing density. /T_his update to 
the University Community Plan 
Project will primarily focus on in -
creasing residential density in the 
Nobel Drive area, La Jolla Village 
Square, UTC, and shopping areas 
in Northern and Southern La Jolla.
University City Planning 
Group Chair Chris Nielsen ex -
plained that the community proj -
ect has /f_ive main focus areas based 
on accessibility to public transpor -
tation, especially trolley routes. 
Included are the Torrey Pines and 
Campus Point areas — “substan -
tially commercial” locations.
Nielsen pointed out that the 
two shopping centers located in 
southern University City con -
structed more residential hous -
ing than biotech or other research 
buildings around current com -
munity retailing service locations. 
On the other hand, the northern 
communities are less likely to go 
through similar changes due to 
the high number of condos and 
restrictions on building heights.
Nevertheless, a number of Uni -
versity City residents have voiced 
concerns about how these changes 
will impact the character of the 
community, among them Sixth 
College /f_i/f_th-year Hyak Khuylan. 
“With signi/f_icant density, that 
can be a problem. If everyone has 
a car and [it can be] hard to /f_ind a 
parking lot, that can lower the liv -
ing standard. But if there is cheap -
er housing, grocery stores and 
whatever you need, I think that 
would be a good part [of] living in 
a more dense area. ” said Khulyan.
/T_he subcommittee and the city 
have not yet /f_inalized the proposal. 
One certain thing is that the cur -
rent forecast, that the ultimate 
housing units should be slightly 
above 28,000 by 2030, will not /f_it 
in the subcommittees’ redevelop -
ment plan anymore, and it will not 
be used as a future target. A num -
ber of current residents wonder if 
the vast diﬀerence in future hous -
ing units is necessary.
For residents concerned about 
the upcoming changes to the Uni -
versity City community, Nielsen 
said, “/T_his is a 20- to 30-year plan, 
not something that is going to be 
done tomorrow. ”
One signi/f_icant factor impact -
ing the project is the expansion of STUDENT ACTIVISM
Students Rally for Reproductive Rights Ahead of Mid -
term Elections
By Zara Irshad /gid00020/gid00006/gid00015/gid00010/gid00016/gid00019/gid00001/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
Just ahead of the midterm elections, dozens of 
students gathered outside Geisel Library on Friday, 
Oct. 28, in support of Proposition 1, which would 
amend the California State Constitution to codify 
abortion rights. In addition to a handful of student 
speakers, Chair of the California Democratic Party 
Rusty Hicks, California Secretary of State Doctor 
Shirley Weber, and Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) spoke 
at the event, re/f_lecting the importance of the issue to 
various levels of governance.
Part of a statewide eﬀort, the rally aimed to raise 
voter turnout and educate Californian students 
about the importance of taking action to protect re -
productive rights. Unlike the entirely student-run 
reproductive rights rally held on campus last spring 
amidst the leaked Supreme Court opposition to Roe 
v. Wade, this rally was organized directly in collabo -
ration with the California Democratic Party. Colleg -
es across the state, including /f_ive other UC campuses, 
are scheduled to hold aﬃliate rallies between Oct. 28 
and Nov. 7. 
Voting “yes” on Prop 1 would allow for the rights 
to abortion and contraceptives to be explicitly noted 
in the State Constitution, adding another layer of 
protection for reproductive rights in California.  
Before the speakers addressed the crowd, stu -
dents lined up for free t-shirts, tote bags, and stickers 
that were supplied by Planned Parenthood and the 
California Democratic Party. Advocates chatted with 
those in line, passing along an email sign-up sheet 
and answering any questions that attendees had 
about voting and Proposition 1. 
/T_he rally began with Earl Warren College junior 
Sparky Mitra, one of the student organizers of the 
rally, who spoke brie/f_ly about her experience being 
from Texas, a state which has severely restricted re -
productive rights for its citizens. 
“/T_he consequences of staying silent are not just 
on the horizon anymore,” Mitra said. “/T_hey are here. 
My brothers, sisters, and cousins in my home state 
of Texas have already seen their rights taken. Choice 
has become too expensive under tyrants nationwide. 
/T_his proposition will ensure that our choice to access 
reproductive healthcare remains free and fair.”  
Although California has already made strides 
for reproductive rights — with most healthcare fa -
cilities providing abortion care, and all University of 
California and California State University campuses 
preparing to oﬀer abortion pills by January of 2023 
— Proposition 1 would further enshrine this right. 
In an interview prior to the rally, Mitra explained 
that further solidifying abortion rights in California 
doesn’t just help those who live in the state but those 
in other parts of the country as well, as many travel to California to access safe and legal abortion care. 
“It needs to be a steadfast reality that abortion 
care will be accessible to anyone who comes to Cali -
fornia, no matter where they’re from, no matter how 
long they’ve been here, if they’re a student, if they’re 
a parent, [or] if they’re undocumented,” Mitra said. 
Student volunteers led chants of phrases like “My 
body, my choice” and “/T_he people united will never 
be divided.” /T_heir voices echoed down Library Walk, 
drawing a larger crowd as the rally went on. 
Weber spoke about how her experience growing 
up as the daughter of sharecroppers in Hope, Arkan -
sas helped her understand the importance of voting. 
“Our democracy is fragile, it is in peril,” Weber 
said. “Now is your moment as a student … and the 
question is what will your children say in 30 or 40 
years about what you did in this moment? Will they 
say that you did it, that you stood up and maintained 
the freedom and justice that we long for and that we 
deserve? Or will they say … that they talked about 
stuﬀ that they could’ve changed, and they chose not 
to?” 
As more students /f_illed in the gaps outside of 
Geisel during Weber’s speech, student leaders hand -
ed out posters that read “abortion is healthcare” and 
“safe + legal abortion = pro life” for them to hold. 
Among the student speakers was Eleanor Roos -
evelt College junior Becca Levinsohn, who spoke to 
the crowd on behalf of Planned Parenthood Genera -
tion Action, a campus organization that advocates for 
access to sexual and reproductive care. Other speak -
ers included Hicks and Scott Peters, both of whom 
emphasized the power in numbers and persistence. 
“We have to win elections. Let’s start with Prop 1, 
like they did in Kansas [and] like they did in Michi -
gan,” Peters said. “Let’s protect our home turf here. 
Let’s pass Prop 1 and get this right embedded in the 
constitution here, and then, let’s win the national 
elections back.”
Mitra formally concluded the rally by remind -
ing students to vote in the upcoming midterms and 
pointing out where students can vote on campus. 
Election Day is Nov. 8, and a ballot drop oﬀ box 
is available on campus outside the Price Center for 
voters to drop oﬀ their signed and sealed mail-in bal -
lots. Geisel Library will also host a Vote Center in the 
Seuss Room where voters can cast ballots and return 
mail-in ballots from Oct. 29 through election day. 
Hours of operation are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. through Nov. 
7, and 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day.

Marketing DirectorsStudents Protest Against AS Measure to Cut EDI 
Budget
BY KAITLIN LEE
/gid00015/gid00006/gid00024/gid00020/gid00001/gid00006/gid00005/gid00010/gid00021/gid00016/gid00019/gid00010/gid00002/gid00013/gid00001/gid00002/gid00020/gid00020/gid00010/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00015/gid00021
A/f_ter a UC San Diego profes -
sor was recorded saying racist vit -
riol against unidenti/f_ied Latino 
workers, students gathered at last 
week’s A.S. Council Meeting to 
protest against a measure to cut 
the A.S. Oﬃce of Equity, Diver -
sity, and Inclusion (EDI) budget. 
At the A.S. meeting last 
Wednesday, Oct. 19, a large num -
ber of activists crowded together, 
lining the sides of the meeting 
room around the gathered Coun -
cil members. 
 At the beginning of the 
meeting, the A.S. Council opened 
the /f_loor to any members of the 
public, and activists lined up to 
present their speeches against 
cutting the EDI budget. In to -
tal, activists spoke for about two 
hours before the meeting could 
oﬃcially begin. 
/T_he activists voiced their gen -
eral frustrations with UCSD, es -
pecially a/f_ter witnessing the viral 
Instagram video of Professor Ter -
nansky making racist comments. 
“You can understand my dis -
gust then, when I saw a profes -
sor from the institution which I 
had worked so hard to get into, 
say racist slurs to my people. As 
a Latinx student organizer, I was 
ready to organize to protect my 
people, as well as continue the 
legacy my parents and many of 
your parents le/f_t you,” said the 
/f_irst activist. 
Others also spoke on the im -
pacts of racism they experienced 
and how it has in/f_luenced their 
lives. 
“A/f_ter so many experiences 
being so unwhite, just to /f_ind out 
[white people] cannot see me as 
American to not being valued for 
my culture, I do not know how 
many of the white people on this 
planet I can trust,” one activist spoke gravely. 
All who spoke in the open 
/f_loor agreed that cutting the bud -
get of the Oﬃce of EDI was irra -
tional and unnecessary and only 
caused more harm for students 
who bene/f_ited from the services 
provided. 
Later in the meeting, Associ -
ate Vice President of Equity, Di -
versity, and Inclusion Cristian 
Fuentes Hernandez and Chief of 
Staﬀ of AS Equity, Diversity, & 
Inclusion Christina Marie Green 
presented a breakdown of the 
proposed budget for the EDI of -
/f_ice for the 2022-2023 school year. 
/T_hey also oﬀered an overview of 
the new events, conferences, and 
on-campus initiatives the oﬃce 
was planning for, as well as the 
annual UCSD cultural celebra -
tion. 
Hernandez /f_irst went over the 
new proposed budget for the of -
/f_ice, comparing it to last year’s 
budget.
Hernandez also went over the 
budget for the Women’s Commis -
sion.
Following the budget break -
downs, Hernandez went over the 
new events and conferences the 
EDI oﬃce are oﬀering. He started 
with the Latinx Leads Student Leadership Conference, a new 
conference that just had its /f_irst 
meeting last weekend. Hernandez 
elaborated that this conference 
endeavors to help UCSD in its 
goal to become a Hispanic-Serv -
ing Institution. 
Green then introduced the 
18th National Black Pre-Law 
Conference and Law Fair at Har -
vard Law School and Boston Col -
lege Law School. Approximately 
eight to 12 aspiring Black lawyers 
will be able to go on a four-day 
trip to Boston to engage in work -
shops and panel discussions. EDI 
hopes to cover all the expenses, 
but the budget has yet to be ap -
proved by the administration.
Additionally, Green went over 
the budget of the Asian Paci/f_ic Is -
lander Student Alliance (APSA) 
Voting Event. 
Green then covered the initia -
tives that EDI wanted to address. 
First, the EDI Oﬃce wanted to 
address the accessibility issue of 
homework access codes, as they 
can be costly for students and dis -
criminatory toward students with 
disabilities, such as those with 
vision impairments. UCSD is 
currently planning on introduc -
ing a Net/f_lix-inspired model for 
textbook and homework access codes, meaning students would 
pay $200 each quarter to access 
codes, but EDI hopes to provide 
sponsorships to help students to 
aﬀord these. However, EDI most -
ly hopes for policy changes and 
will send a survey to get a consen -
sus on how to access homework 
and textbook codes. Additionally, 
Hernandez stated that the EDI 
oﬃce plans to collaborate with 
the Raza Resource Centro and 
the Triton Food Pantry to estab -
lish additional food pantries at 
the resource centers, such as the 
Women’s Resource Center and 
the Cross-Cultural Center. 
Finally, Hernandez went 
over the UCSD Annual Cultural 
Celebration, which will happen 
sometime in the winter or Spring 
Quarter, as well as other events 
planned out for those quarters. 
A.S. meetings are held every 
Wednesday at 6 p.m. at the Forum 
at Price Center East on the Fourth 
Floor. /T_hey are also streamed live 
on the Associated Students Face -
book.

this article was not able to record 
the names of those speaking at the 
protest.

UCSD Health Offers Treatment for Urinary Tract Cancer that 
Could Prevent Kidney Dialysis and Transplant
BY Chelsea Blankenchip
/gid00004/gid00016/gid00015/gid00021/gid00019/gid00010/gid00003/gid00022/gid00021/gid00010/gid00015/gid00008/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
In September, the /f_irst series 
of a new treatment for low-grade 
upper tract urothelial cancer 
(LG-UTUC) was completed for a 
patient at UC San Diego Health. 
UCSD Health doctors are now 
administering Jelmyto, the /f_irst 
Food and Drug Administration-
approved drug for LG-UTUC. 
Jelmyto is a combination of mi -
tomycin, an established chemo -
therapy drug, and hydrogel, a 
water-soluble polymer developed 
for use in humans. /T_his particular 
hydrogel is a liquid when cold, but 
a gel at body temperature, allow -
ing doctors to administer the cold 
drug as a liquid through a cathe -
ter. /T_he drug then solidi/f_ies into a 
gel and stays in the treatment area for 4-6 hours. 
LG-UTUC is a subtype of up -
per tract urothelial cancer that is 
less likely to spread to other parts 
of the body. While metastasis, the 
spread of cancer in the body, is 
not usually an issue for this type 
of cancer, it can still cause prob -
lems in the urogenital tract by 
blocking urine /f_low.
/T_hese tumors are found in the 
epithelium of the kidneys and 
the ureter, the tubes connecting 
the kidneys to the bladder. /T_he 
standard of care for these tumors 
is o/f_ten radical nephroureterec -
tomy, which is the removal of the 
kidney, ureter, and part of the 
bladder. While there are some 
alternative treatments to save the 
kidneys, such as an endoscopic 
tumor removal — the removal 
of a tumor with the assistance of a small camera — the urogenital 
tract is complex, making this pro -
cedure diﬃcult. 
Furthermore, each of these 
treatment methods — RNU and 
endoscopic tumor removal — 
have associated risks. RNU is as -
sociated with decreased kidney 
function in the long term and the 
development of chronic kidney 
disease, which is a risk factor for 
hospitalization, heart disease, 
and death. Endoscopic tumor 
removal has higher cancer recur -
rence rates than RNU.
Dr. Aditya Bagrodia, Asso -
ciate Professor of Urology and 
Genitourinary Oncology Lead at 
UCSD Health, commended the 
work of UCSD health employees 
in making this treatment pos -
sible.
 Bagrodia noted, “the coordi -nation required from the cancer 
center, from the pharmacy, from 
the operating room, and from the 
urology administrative staﬀ and 
the herculean eﬀorts from each 
one of those parties is what makes 
this possible. It’s a lot of work but 
it’s worth it for our patients.”
According to Jelmyto’s web -
site, the drug was found to be 
remarkably eﬀective, as “58% of 
patients had their tumors disap -
pear a/f_ter treatment with Jelmy -
to,” and one year a/f_ter treatment, 
the majority of patients whose tu -
mors disappeared were still can -
cer-free. Jelmyto’s eﬃcacy makes 
endoscopic tumor removal using 
Jelmyto a more viable alternative 
to RNU.
Jelmyto is a great option for 
patients because it provides LG-
UTUC patients the opportunity to preserve one of their kidneys. 
/T_his further prevents other com -
plications associated with kidney 
removals like dialysis, kidney 
transplant, and kidney disease.
While it’s too soon to tell how 
eﬀective the treatment will be for 
UCSD Health patients, Bagrodia 
is “optimistic that our patients are 
going to do well with it.”
Jelmyto was approved for use 
by the FDA in April of 2020, but 
the rarity of the disease and an in -
tensive drug administration pro -
gram delayed its use at UCSD. Ac -
cording to the FDA, 6,000-8,000 
cases of LG-UTUC are diagnosed 
each year in the United States. 
UTUC aﬀects approximately 2 
people per 100,000 people each 
year, and LG-UTUC accounts for 
30% of UTUC patients.

public transportation. 
“For the residents of South 
[University City], there’s no ef -
fective transit there and probably 
not going to be for a while. North 
[University City] is diﬀerent, ” clar -
i/f_ied Nielsen. “Generally speaking, 
[North University City] has good 
transits, which has probably bet -
ter frequency and service than 
anywhere else. So, building higher 
density in North [University City] 
does make sense, and it’s likely to 
occur. ”
Khulyan agreed with the value 
of public transportation in Uni -
versity City. 
“If you live anywhere other than University City, you need a 
car to get to campus. [For those] 
living in University City, it’s a 
15-minute bus ride, ” he explained. 
“But if I live in Mira Mesa or 
somewhere south, I would need to 
own a car to get to campus or any -
where else in San Diego. /T_hat’s the 
problem with the way San Diego 
develops in general. ” 
However, the project plan up -
date states that student housing 
needs will not be given special at -
tention. 
It states, “/T_he focus of the Uni -
versity Plan Update is to increase 
opportunities for homes near 
transit investments for all San Di -egans, not just students, especially 
given that increases in housing for 
students and faculty connected to 
UCSD does not alleviate the City’s 
state obligations to provide addi -
tional opportunities for homes. ”
Nielsen provided an explana -
tion for this approach. “/T_he single 
most important thing the Uni -
versity can do is what it’s already 
doing, which is building more 
beds on campus, even though that 
sounds like pushing it back onto 
the University. ” Nielsen elaborat -
ed, “but the cheapest housing is 
always [on] the land [of campus]. ”
“I think the answer [about fu -
ture housing price compared to current] is probably not much dif -
ferent, ” Nielsen said, “/T_he hous -
ing in the area is aﬀected by more 
than just the supply [and] demand 
from the local area. It’s kind of 
global and regional at the same 
time. People that want units have 
to do the industries in this area. It’s 
not just about students and cur -
rent residents. ” 
Most junior and senior under -
graduate students live in double 
or even triple rooms oﬀ-campus 
due to the lack of available UCSD 
housing, fourth-year Roger Rev -
elle College Tanmay Kulkarni 
noted.
Under intense housing pres -sure, students turn their expecta -
tions to campus.
“/T_he housing can be built, 
and the school can also subsidize 
students to help with rent. Maybe 
[the] school can take some [re -
sponsibility] for students looking 
for housing. /T_he developers can 
get housing guarantees and stu -
dents can get cheaper housing. I 
don’t see how the two are mutually 
exclusive, ” said Khulyan.

On September 27th, iInternet 
celebrities known as the Try Guys 
announced that Ned Fulmer, one 
of the four Try Guys and co-
founder of 2nd Try LLC, would 
no longer be working with the 
company.
Ned Fulmer would be de -
parted from have to leave the 
Try Guys as a result of in/f_idel -
ity in the workplace. Due to the 
popularity of the Try Guys, this 
announcement was soon all over 
the Internet.
/T_he Try Guys began their 
journey as BuzzFfeed stars eight 
years ago, building their brand 
as a group of four guys trying 
out weird or new experiences, 
ranging from trying on wom -
en’s underwear to challenging a 
world-class poker player in her 
own domain. /T_heir /f_inal video on 
Buzzfeed, “Try Guys Race Dog 
Sleds,” was released on Febru -
ary 18, 2018. A/f_ter a short hiatus, 
on June 16, 2018, they created 
their own YouTube channel and 
founded their own company to 
better manage and control their 
creative output. 
Over time, their fame reached 
great heights. /T_hey published a #1 
New York Times Bestseller, went 
on tour as “Legends of the Inter -
net” and published a documenta -
ry about themselves. /T_heir Food 
Network show, “No Recipe Road 
Trip,” was mid-season when their 
announcement about Ned leav -
ing went publicdropped. 
Fulmer had established his 
long-time brand as “the wife guy,” and Try Guys fans wit -
nessed the Fulmer family grow 
over the years in real- time. He 
and his wife also released con -
tent together, including the series 
“Try DIY” and their “Date Night 
Cookbook.”
On Oct.ober 3rd, the remain -
ing Try Guys, Zach Kornfeld, 
Keith Habersburger and Eu -
gene Lee Yang released a video 
addressing the situation, titled 
“what happened.” /T_he video 
burned through the Internet, 
amassinggaining over 11 million 
views and 900,000 likes.
/T_he Try Guys scandal reached 
shocking levels of fame in a short 
time frame. Memes raced across 
social media at Fulmer’s expense, 
mocking his apology post for 
dancing around the word “aﬀair.” 
Popular news outlets such as the 
LA Times, New York Times and 
Rolling Stone published articles 
addressing the situation. 
To top it all oﬀ, on Oct.ober 
8th, NBC’s parody sketch show 
Saturday Night Live (SNL) re -
leased a skit about the Try Guys’ 
response to the situation.
/T_he skit presents the Try Guys 
as unreasonable, /f_iring their 
friend for a “consensual kiss” 
and stealing awayattempting to 
grab the attention of the masses 
fromover more important issues 
such as the Ukrainian War.
SNL asks the question of why 
everyone cares so much about the 
Try Guys. As the skit puts it, “Jay-
Z cheated on Beyoncé.” Other ce -
lebrities famous for loving their 
wives, such as Adam Levine and 
John Mulaney, have cheated on 
their spouses. What makes this 
case so special?/T_he answer boils down to 
what SNL sarcastically explains: 
“You have to remember the power 
dynamics … He is a Try Guy, and 
she is a Food Baby.”
While this statement was 
clearly made in jest, it points out a 
key aspect of the aﬀair. /T_he “Food 
Babies” is a spinoﬀ show on the 
Try Guys YouTube channel, fea -
turing YB Chang and Alexandria 
Herring. /T_he woman in question 
is Alexandria Herring, who Ful -
mer had anhis aﬀair with. 
In other words, Fulmer had an 
aﬀair with his employee.
SNL also blatantly misreport -
ed certain facts about the situa -
tion. /T_hey claim that all of this is 
over “a consensual kiss,” implying 
that this was a short- term aﬀair, 
while in reality it “had been going 
on for some time.” 
2nd Try LLC is more than 
just the Try Guys YouTube chan -
nel; it’s a company with bosses 
and employees. Fulmer’s aﬀair, 
though allegedly consensual, 
was a case of severe workplace 
misconduct due to the inherent 
power dynamic. /T_hough Fulmer 
emphasizes the consensuality of 
the relationship, it’s impossible to 
know exactly what transpired. 
SNL may want its audience to 
laugh oﬀ this discrepancy with 
the use of titles like “Try Guy” 
and “Food Baby,” but the power 
diﬀerential between employer 
and employee still stands. 
/T_he Internet has taken a /f_irm 
stand beside the Try Guys in the 
matter, shaming SNL for their 
tone- deaf read of the situation. 
/T_he top comment on the sketch 
reads, “shoutout to whoever wrote 
the sketch for misunderstanding the entire situation” and boasts 
20,000 likes. 
Additionally, the skit implies 
that the Try Guys’ felt betrayed 
because they didn’t know  about 
the aﬀair, when, in reality, Ful -
mer’s actions jeopardized the en -
tire company. A potential sexual 
misconduct lawsuit could have 
sunk their small business, and as 
content producers entirely depen -
dent on their audience for pro/f_it 
and relevance, any harm to their 
brand could severely cripple their 
livelihoods. 
Critics of the SNL skit don’t 
hesitate to point out that SNL has 
been battling sexual misconduct 
allegations of its own. According 
to CNN, as recently as Aug.ust 
25, SNL alum Horatio Sanz faced 
accusations of grooming and ad -
vances on underage women.
Allegations go beyond just 
one alum, however. Jane Doe, a 
victim of Sanz’s sexual aggres -
sion, charges several Saturday 
Night Live superstars, such as 
Jimmy Fallon and Tracy Morgan, 
as witnesses and accomplices of 
the blatant, nonconsensual sexual 
asssault she experienced at SNL’s 
famous a/f_terparties. 
Her accusations detail a his -
tory of SNL covering up sexual 
assault incidents and excusing a 
misogynistic culture. Jane Cur -
tin, Julia Sweeney, Janeane Ga -
rofalo, Nora Dunn, Julia Louis-
Dreyfus, Anne Beatts, and Ana 
Gasteyer all commented onupon 
their negative experiences when 
working with the cast of SNLSat -
urday Night Live.

sexually abused in the workplace, 
such as anxiety and depression, 
as well as detailing the potential 
risks that reporting abuse poses, 
such as job loss or retaliation 
from their abuser.
Accountability for and ac -
knowledgement of sexual crimes 
is essential. A study by Haley 
Clark, published in the FAMILY 
MATTERS journal, /f_inds that 
many sexual assault survivors 
turn to the courts, not for justice 
or retaliation, but rather to have 
someone acknowledge the depth 
of the pain they experienced. 
In recent years, awareness for 
the victims of sexual violence has 
skyrocketed, largely in part to the 
#MeToo movement of 2017, which 
urged survivors of such crimes to 
speak up about their suﬀering as 
a part of a collective, displaying 
just how big of a problem sexual 
violence had become.
/T_he SNL skit, as well as the 
Try Guys’ response to this situ -
ation, illuminates an important 
factor of the modern Internet: 
people can be held accountable. 
BuzzFfeed reports on widespread 
responses to the situation: they 
praise the Try Guys for holding 
their friend accountable, and they 
admonish SNL for letting Fulmer, 
the one responsible for the situa -
tion, escape criticism.
Accountability is the corner -
stone of this whole case;. SNL 
faces backlash for siding with si -
lence, and the Try Guys (minus 
Fulmer) earn respect by saying 
their piece.

The Global Press Problem  
In May of 2022, Columbia 
University announced the win -
ners of the Pulitzer Prize, jour -
nalism’s most prestigious award. 
Among the winners was Sanna 
Irshad Mattoo, an Indian pho -
tojournalist for Reuters. Mat -
too and two colleagues won the 
award for their images capturing 
the second wave of COVID-19 in 
India in the spring of 2021. /T_he 
wave killed millions, with many 
deaths still unreported. Mattoo’s 
work served as a vital check on 
the Indian government, but her 
subsequent treatment demon -
strates the trend of intimidation 
and violence against journalists, 
not just in India but worldwide. 
Mattoo was due to leave New 
Delhi to collect the award on 
Oct. 17, but Indian immigration 
oﬃcials stopped her from leav -
ing. /T_his was despite having a 
valid U.S. visa and an invitation 
from the Pulitzer board to attend 
the ceremony. Mattoo did not 
receive a response to her ques -
tions about any possible orders 
against her, and Reuters stated 
that they “had not been oﬀered 
an oﬃcial explanation” either. 
Since his election in May 
2014, Narendra Modi’s govern -
ment has cracked down on jour -
nalists it deems insuﬃciently 
supportive of its Hindu nation -
alist agenda. In May, Reporters 
Without Borders ranked India 
150th out of 180 countries in 
their World Press Index; they 
cited the imprisonment of jour -
nalists in the internationally-
contested Kashmir region and 
the state of Uttar Pradesh, gov -
erned by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata 
Party (BJP). Journalists who are 
Muslim — a religious minority in 
India — face extensive discrimi -
nation in particular. Prominent 
female journalist Rana Ayuub has 
been threatened online for years 
and was barred from leaving the 
country, like Mattoo, in March. But, perhaps the most egregious 
action was the hostile takeover 
of the news organization NDTV , 
one of the few non-government 
aligned networks remaining, by 
Gautam Adani. Adani is among 
the world’s richest men and has 
bene/f_ited extensively from gov -
ernment contracts handed out 
by his friend, Modi. His takeover 
of NDTV symbolizes the gov -
ernment gaining control over 
the last bastion of freedom on 
Indian network television news.  
Modi’s crackdown on the free 
press follows a disturbing modern 
trend. /T_he free press has been en -
dangered for years now, and this 
will only worsen with the rise of 
right-wing, anti-liberal govern -
ments. Former President Don -
ald Trump spoke of the press as 
the “enemy of the people” , while 
Brazilian President Jair Bolsana -
ro and Hungarian Prime Minis -
ter Viktor Orban, among others, 
have seemingly followed his lead. 
How does society weather this 
storm? History has shown that the 
loss of a free press paves the way 
for authoritarianism and war — 
the rise of Nazi Germany and the 
ensuing Second World War are a 
testament to this. As former Pres -
ident George W . Bush once said, 
“the desire for freedom resides in 
each human heart. ” By informing 
the wider population of the threat 
to journalists and a free press and 
the stakes of the outcome of this 
battle, the tide of public opinion 
can be turned against this sup -
pression of journalists’ voices. 
But, as long as voters see no con -
/f_lict in voting for candidates who 
oppose a free press and simulta -
neously claim to uphold the vir -
tues of freedom and liberty, this 
pivot remains a distant fantasy. 
Awareness is key, and this starts 
with local media; readers should 
consider supporting local jour -
nalists and news sources that 
keep governments accountable. 
A strong press means a strong 
check on power, and this in turn 
leads to a stronger, freer, society: 
an outcome better for all of us.

“Suspiria” 
(1977) 
“Suspiria,” the original 1977 release of “Sus -
piria” directed by Dario Argento, follows Suzy 
Bannion, a young American dancer, as she ar -
rives in Germany to attend a prestigious dance 
academy. As she walks through the airport, the 
score suddenly begins blaring; it seems horren -
dously mismatched for a walk through an emp -
ty airport late at night. Immediately, you are 
put on edge. Suzy arrives at the Academy and 
witnesses another young woman run through 
the front door while yelling to someone who 
remains hidden inside. /T_he idea that some hor -
rible thing awaits her inside creeps into your 
mind and spends the rest of the /f_ilm festering. 
It is hard to describe the bizarre and unset -
tling feeling that “Suspiria” allows to seep into 
you. /T_he /f_ilm is Italian, yet the dialogue is in 
English and dubbed post-production. /T_he set 
design is overwhelmingly stylized and vibrant, 
/f_illed with beautiful designs and saturated col -
ors. /T_he score, done by the Italian band Goblin, 
is as striking as the sets. /T_he incredible beauty 
of these aspects interacts strangely with the 
hokey dubbing and practical eﬀects, furthering 
the bizarre and unsettling viewing experience. 
/T_he bifurcation between the /f_ilms most terrify -
ing and corny is most apparent during its best 
scene. At one point, a blind man and his service 
dog become lost in the square of a city. /T_he dog 
begins to bark incessantly, frightening his own -
er. /T_he owner begins to turn back and forth, 
frantically asking who is there. Argento then 
pans out to an extreme wide shot, and we see an 
absence of anything. /T_here is simply the square, 
the man, the dog, and darkness. /T_his height of 
terror is quickly followed (without spoiling too 
much) by the worst-looking practical eﬀects of 
the /f_ilm, leaving you to question why you were 
just /f_illed with such a deep dread. 
/T_hough the /f_ilm would be worth watching 
for either the campy dialogue or its best horror-
/f_illed moments alone, the combination of the 
two make it a unique and wonderful Halloween 
experience. Matthew Risley  /gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019

“It’s the Great 
Pumpkin, Char -
lie Brown” (1966)
Originally aired in 1966, “It’s the Great Pump -
kin, Charlie Brown” is a nostalgic Halloween classic. 
Following the characters from the  “Peanuts” comic 
strips, the television special follows Charlie Brown 
and his friends as they celebrate Halloween. /T_he 
plot mainly revolves around Charlie Brown’s friend, 
Linus, who believes in the Great Pumpkin. Like San -
ta Claus, the Great Pumpkin is a mythical creature 
who brings candy and toys to all the good children 
who believe in him. So, while Linus’ friends spend 
their Halloween trick-or-treating, Linus spends his 
Halloween in a pumpkin patch, determined to meet 
the Great Pumpkin. Plus, as a subplot, we get Snoopy 
dressed up as a World War I /f_lying ace in the sky; 
what’s not to love? 
Like the other “Peanuts” specials, the soundtrack 
is composed by Vince Guaraldi, who provides noth -
ing less than a brilliant jazz soundtrack to accom -
pany the adorable animation. And, of course, the 
humor in this is ageless. /T_here’s the typical football 
gag, the famous “I got a rock” line, and jokes about 
getting sued. But my favorite quip would have to be 
Linus saying, “there are three things I’ve learned 
never to discuss with people: religion, politics, and 
the Great Pumpkin” — same, Linus. 
If you’re not into gore or anything too scary, “It’s 
the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown” is the perfect 
special to get you into the Halloween spirit. With 
a run time of 25 minutes, this short is a nostalgia-
packed special with jokes that still make me laugh 
every year I watch it. You’ll feel like a kid again; I 
sure do.

Halloween Heist 
Episodes
/T_his show’s tradition started in the Season 1 episode titled “Halloween,” 
when main character Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) bets he can steal Cap -
tain Holt’s (Andre Braugher) Medal of Valor from his oﬃce by midnight 
on Halloween night. /T_his leads to a night /f_illed with Jake Peralta-style she -
nanigans and a hilariously unrecognizable costume worn by Charles Boyle 
(Joe Lo Truglio), which ends with Jake winning the heist. /T_he antics ramp  
up in the next Halloween episode in Season 2 titled “Halloween II,” when 
Jake bets against Captain Holt that he can steal his watch. /T_his time he en -
lists the help of a pickpocketer who ends up stealing the watch, making this 
heist extra diﬃcult. At the end it is revealed that Holt planned this all along 
and the watch never le/f_t his person, making him the winner of that year’s 
heist. /T_hat episode also followed a B-plot involving Gina Linetti’s (Chelsea 
Pretti) dance group kicking her out, resulting in the episode ending with a 
great dance number featuring Terry Jeﬀords (Terry Crews) and Gina. /T_he 
next installment titled “Halloween, Part III,” in Season 3, sees Jake and 
Holt competing for the title of “Amazing Detective slash Genius’’ with a 
surprise turn of events where Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero) wins a/f_ter 
being le/f_t out of the heist by both Holt and Jake. “Halloween IV,” which 
takes place in Season 4, has the entire B99 squad competing for the title of 
“the ultimate detective slash genius,” where Gina fools everyone and wins. 
My favorite heist, however, is the Season 5 episode “HalloVeen,” when the 
B99 squad embarks on their /f_i/f_th annual Halloween heist where the prize 
is a championship belt. /T_his year sees alliances forming, Holt enlisting the 
help of the fan favorite corgi Cheddar, and the surprise engagement that 
happens when Jake proposes to Amy at the end. Although there was no 
de/f_inite winner that year, it’s clear the real winners are the happy newly 
engaged couple.
 /T_hese “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” episodes put a diﬀerent spin on the classic 
sitcom Halloween special. Instead of centering it around Halloween, they 
make the main focus the heist and use the holiday as a framing device. 
Each installment has its own unique and fun twist and showcases not only 
each character’s skill set, but just how far they are willing to go to win a title 
with no merit. As a sitcom fan, these episodes are always my go-to every 
Halloween season, and it’s a great quick binge if you’re in the mood for a 
light Halloween marathon.Kamiah Johnson  /gid00020/gid00006/gid00015/gid00010/gid00016/gid00019/gid00001/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019“My house 
walk-through” 
(2016)
 “My house walk-through” is a little piece of 
horror that takes full advantage of a lot of com -
mon YouTube horror tropes and expertly com -
mands them to create one of the most unset -
tling videos on the platform.
As the title suggests, the video is a walk -
through of the narrator’s traditional Japanese-
style home, complete with tatami mats and 
fusuma sliding doors. /T_he person holding the 
camera never says a word during the video; 
however, captions describing the various house 
furnishings and family history are provided in 
both English and Japanese. 
In the video, you have no autonomy over the 
person navigating the home. For the 12-minute 
duration of the video, you are transported on 
a set path, with no option of pacing yourself. 
/T_he narrator presses on reminiscing about their 
grandfather’s sutras, scattered photos, and all 
the various rooms. “/T_his room has no taste,” 
the narrator says. While it all sounds perfectly 
tame on the surface, nothing could be farther 
from the truth.
Horror is at its best when it’s subverting 
one’s own expectations; you believe you know 
what’s going to be thrown at you, then all of 
a sudden you have the rug pulled from under 
you. /T_he use of YouTube as the medium makes 
the video appear unassuming and inoﬀensive 
at /f_irst glance. Any unsuspecting viewer would 
take it as any low-eﬀort house tour video. How -
ever, underneath that modest title and saturat -
ed thumbnail is a gruesome experience lying in 
wait. 
PiroPito, the video creator, writes in the de -
scription, “this is not horror video. /T_his video 
was created simply by /f_ilming inside my house,” 
a revelation that seems to raise more fear than 
it extinguishes. It’s a grim reminder that reality 
is more horri/f_ic than any fantasy that could be 
conjured up by some artist. Fabian Garcia  /gid00020/gid00006/gid00015/gid00010/gid00016/gid00019/gid00001/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019ful designs and saturated colors. /T_he score, done by the Italian 
band Goblin, is as striking as the sets. /T_he incredible beauty of 
these aspects interacts strangely with the hokey dubbing and 
practical eﬀects, furthering the bizarre and unsettling viewing 
experience. /T_he bifurcation between the /f_ilms most terrifying 
and corny is most apparent during its best scene. At one point, 
a blind man and his service dog become lost in the square of a 
city. /T_he dog begins to bark incessantly, frightening his owner. 
/T_he owner begins to turn back and forth, frantically asking who 
is there. Argento then pans out to an extreme wide shot, and we 
see an absence of anything. /T_here is simply the square, the man, 
the dog, and darkness. /T_his height of terror is quickly followed 
(without spoiling too much) by the worst-looking practical ef -
fects of the /f_ilm, leaving you to question why you were just /f_illed 
with such a deep dread. 
/T_hough the /f_ilm would be worth watching for either the 
campy dialogue or its best horror-/f_illed moments alone, the 
combination of the two make it a unique and wonderful Hal -
loween experience. PHOTO ESSAY/C.cap/O.cap/N.cap/T.cap/A.cap/C.cap/T.cap /T.cap/H.cap/E.cap /E.cap/D.cap/I.cap/T.cap/O.cap/R.cap /P.cap/H.cap/O.cap/T.cap/O.cap/G.cap/R.cap/A.cap/P.cap/H.cap/E.cap/R.cap/S.cap

Out at the Amphitheater: A Spooktacular Drag Show
On Friday, Oct. 28th, the new Epstein Family Amphitheater wit -
nessed an electrifying night of Halloween-themed drag performances. 
Hosted by Amber St. James and Luna Deathwish, “Out at the Amphi -

Almond Eyez, also based in San Diego. Organized by the UC San Diego 
Undergraduate Colleges, LGBT Resource Center, and Triton Fest, the 
show was free for all current UCSD students.

Divisive Vices: Yay or Nay on These Halloween Staples
By Samantha Phan
/gid00013/gid00010/gid00007/gid00006/gid00020/gid00021/gid00026/gid00013/gid00006/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
Happy Halloween, everyone! 
I hope you all are having a great 
start to the spookiest night of the 
year. As someone who is an avid, 
and longtime Hallows Eve cel -
ebrator, I /f_ind myself quali/f_ied to 
discuss some of the most polar -
izing aspects of this great holi -
day. Y ou might /f_ind you agree or 
strongly disagree with what I am 
about to share, but what is Hal -
loween without a little trickiness?
On Horror Movies: Y ou either 
love or hate them. Some people 
shy away from the guts and gore, 
preferring to watch /f_ilms that 
don’t make their  hearts beat one 
hundred times its usual speed. 
Others crave the thrill and adren -
aline, watching scary movies from 
dusk to dawn. Is there any better 
time of year than Halloween to in -
dulge in a few horror /f_licks?
Y es, there is a better time of 
year, and that time of year is never. 
Don’t get me wrong, I love holiday 
movies. But something about the 
disturbing, bloody nature of the 
horror genre makes me want to 
run for the hills instead of sitting 
on the couch. I would prefer to 
spend my /f_irst week of Novem -
ber free of nightmares and jump 
scares. A happy and fun Hallow -
een movie would be much better 
in my book, which brings me to 
my second divisive opinion. 
On “/T_he Nightmare Before 
Christmas”: One of my favorite 
movies ever. /T_he songs, the ani -
mation, and the characters are all 
top-notch. When I was younger, 
I tried to watch this movie every 
year but was too afraid to /f_inish 
it. But, once I quit being scared of 
the opening sequence, it was like I 
had seen magic. For me, the /f_ilm is 
a wonderfully nostalgic and excit -
ing experience every single time I 
watch it. /T_his holiday movie de/f_i -nitely goes in my top /f_ive.
But, for what holiday? /T_he 
question I seek to answer is 
whether “/T_he Nightmare Before 
Christmas” is a Halloween movie 
or a Christmas movie. My gut 
instinct is to say Halloween; for 
us non-horror watchers, this is 
one of the few spooky (but not 
scary) movies available. But, a/f_ter 
some consideration, I would con -
clude that “/T_he Nightmare Before 
Christmas” is a Christmas movie. 
Most of the movie (spoiler alert) 
involves preparing for Christmas. 
Halloween is merely the backdrop 
for which the characters are mo -
tivated. Plus, Christmas is in the title. But, honestly, who cares? 
I could watch this movie in the 
middle of July, and it would still 
be just as good. 
On Plastic Pumpkins: Oh, 
pumpkins. /T_he best way to tell 
that Halloween is approaching 
is by keeping an eye out for this 
brightly colored gourd. Come the 
end of September, you start see -
ing pumpkins everywhere. Pump -
kin bread, pumpkin pie, and of 
course, the classic pumpkin spice 
latte: all amazing. However, noth -
ing — even the PSL — is better 
than decorating your front door 
with a beautiful pumpkin. But, 
does it have to be a real one?Of course, a real pumpkin is 
more authentic. Y ou can get one 
by going to the pumpkin patch for 
a true fall experience. Get creative, 
and carve some jack-o-lanterns, 
giving your front door a more 
spooky feel. But, be warned, it will 
go bad pretty soon a/f_ter Hallow -
een, and if you do not clean it up, 
you will have quite a frightening 
sight.
Plastic pumpkins, on the other 
hand, are arti/f_icial and tacky, but 
they are also convenient. Y ou can 
use the same ones every Hallow -
een, and they never go bad. Also, 
even though you cannot carve 
them, you can still use some paint and glitter to decorate.
But, which to choose? I hon -
estly prefer real pumpkins; I love 
the smell, the carving experience, 
and the look of a grown vegetable 
sitting on my front porch. Howev -
er, if you indulge in plastic pump -
kins, I hold no judgment. /T_hough 
they do not look as cool, they still 
embody the Halloween spirit. 
On Candy Corn: I would say 
this Halloween treat is the most 
divisive thing on this list. Candy 
is a staple of Halloween, and what 
candy celebrates the holiday more 
than candy corn? Sure, you can 
buy it year-round, but we all know 
it’s a Halloween snack. 
Now, is it good or not? Is candy 
corn a sweet, delicious treat that 
puts everybody in a festive mood? 
Or is it chalky, colored wax that 
looks too similar to teeth for any -
one to enjoy? Y ou are all entitled 
to your own opinion, but me, 
personally? I think candy corn is 
delicious. It used to be one of my 
favorite candies, and I would eat it 
year-round, even if I had to go to 
the very back of the store to /f_ind it. 
I acknowledge that it might be too 
sweet, look a little weird, or have 
a gross texture. In fact, I think all 
of these things are true. And yet, 
none of them will stop me from 
enjoying the quintessential holi -
day snack. 
I hope you enjoyed reading 
about all of these Halloween sta -
ples. While you might disagree 
with some of my opinions, just 
know these are the right ones, and 
if you think anything else you are 
wrong! My opinion is the only 
right one. But, all jokes aside, I 
hope everyone has a happy Hal -
loween and a lovely /f_irst week of 
November. 
Scare you later!
The Perfect Halloween Costume
By Viggo Kovas
/gid00004/gid00016/gid00015/gid00021/gid00010/gid00003/gid00022/gid00021/gid00010/gid00015/gid00008/gid00001/gid00013/gid00010/gid00007/gid00006/gid00020/gid00021/gid00026/gid00013/gid00006/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
So, it’s the day of Halloween 
and you haven’t even thought 
about your costume. Whether it 
was out of sheer laziness or mid -
terms keeping you busy, the fact 
of the matter is, you goofed up. 
But fear not! I have been in this 
exact situation before, and have 
devised the perfect Halloween 
costume that can be made in un -
der a day!
/T_he /f_irst thing you’ll need is 
a mask. My personal favorite is 
a Y akuza mask, speci/f_ically from 
the Tokugawa Shogunate era 
of Japan. While this choice has 
been met with much criticism by 
people (who don’t dress up for 
Halloween), I’ve found it to be a 
perfect mask. It hides your age so 
adults can’t question why a college 
student is still trick-or-treating, 
and avoids sending them scream -
ing in true Halloween fashion. 
I’ d recommend sprinkling fake 
blood on top of the mask, even 
going as far as carrying a plastic 
knife around if you want to give 
them a proper scare. 
But wait, I hear you saying, 
“what if I get cold while trick-or-
treating?” A trivial matter easily 
solved with one of the greatest 
temperature regulators known 
(to me): feathers. /T_hese can be 
gathered from local birds across 
campus, and the best part is that 
they’re free of charge! Y es, I can 
already hear complaints about 
having to gather feathers, but I 
never said this costume would be 
easy. Some of my colleagues use tape for making the feathers stick, 
but I prefer using glue. It’s much 
easier to coat your body in all the 
feathers rather than tape each in -
dividual feather. Plus, it does won -
ders for your pores.
At the end of the day though, 
Halloween is about candy. /T_he un -
initiated will think to bring more 
bags to hold more candy, but for this costume, I take this concept 
to the next level. To maximize 
candy, mannequins will be your 
best friends. Simply drape them 
in a white blanket, as if they were 
wearing a ghost costume, make 
them hold a pillow case, and pre -
tend they’re real trick-or-treaters. 
And boom! Y ou’ve just multi -
plied your candy haul tenfold. Make sure the mannequins are 
small enough to pass as children; 
that way they’ll be more likely to 
get more candy. /T_hen, attach a 
string to them and drag your new 
“friends” along with you through 
the night.
/T_his may seem rather daunt -
ing, but with enough motivation 
and elbow grease, you’ll /f_ind your way. However, as the creator of 
this idea, I do require a 20% inter -
est fee on the candy you receive. 
Y ou can leave it in the basement 
of Geisel Library — I’ll know 
where to /f_ind it. Happy Hallow -
een and may the perfect costume 
lead you to many candy riches!

Despite Gutsy Performance, UCSD Ends Season With Loss to Cal Poly
By Kurt Johnston
/gid00004/gid00016/gid00015/gid00021/gid00019/gid00010/gid00003/gid00022/gid00021/gid00010/gid00015/gid00008/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
/T_he UC San Diego women’s 
soccer (3–10–6, 2–4–4 Big West) 
team fell just short of victory on 
their Senior Night, losing 1–0 to 
California Polytechnic University, 
San Luis Obispo (9–6–3, 6–1–3 
Big West). A pre-game celebration 
of the team’s graduating seniors 
seemed to inspire the Tritons, 
who put on an all-around im -
pressive performance against the 
Mustangs. However, Cal Poly SLO 
held onto a 53rd-minute goal to 
win the game and clinched the Big 
West’s regular season crown. 
UCSD opened the /f_irst half of 
senior night on /f_ire, putting im -
mense pressure on the Cal Poly 
SLO back line. Senior mid/f_ielders 
Kate Hottinger, Mika Celeste, and 
Christina Oddone ran the show in 
the /f_irst few minutes, controlling 
the /f_ield in their /f_inal game for the 
Tritons. UCSD had several near-
goals, but the Tritons were unable 
to directly challenge the Cal Poly 
SLO goalkeeper.
Around the 15-minute mark, the momentum of the game shi/f_t -
ed, and Cal Poly SLO gained the 
advantage. A de/f_lected shot by the 
Mustangs in the 16th minute led 
to the /f_irst corner of the match, 
but a dangerous cross was head -
ed clear. Minutes later, Cal Poly 
SLO was awarded a free kick a/f_ter 
a questionable yellow card was 
shown to senior defender Kate -
lyn Meyer. However, the ensuing 
shot was bounced to UCSD’s ju -
nior goalkeeper Keara Fitzgerald 
for her /f_irst of eight saves in the 
match. 
/T_he Tritons and the Mustangs 
played a game of cat and mouse 
for the remainder of the half, with 
both teams having spells of pos -
session. Fitzgerald’s booming goal 
kicks launched several UCSD at -
tacks, but /f_licked headers from 
mid/f_ield found the Cal Poly SLO’s 
goalkeeper, not Triton wingers. 
Fitzgerald was instrumental in 
keeping the game scoreless, as she 
made a diving stop and two leap -
ing catches in quick succession to 
deny Cal Poly SLO an opener.
/T_he best chance of the /f_irst 
period came in the /f_inal seconds. 
UCSD earned a corner, and a driven cross was excellently struck 
into the center of the box. Sopho -
more mid/f_ielder Camryn Borg’s 
would-be buzzer-beating header 
/f_loated over the outstretched arm 
of the Mustang goalkeeper, but 
unfortunately for the Tritons, over 
the crossbar as well. /T_he half-time 
whistle signaled a scoreless /f_irst-
half, and the Tritons were incred -
ibly unlucky not to lead at the 
break.
/T_he second-half began franti -
cally, with the Tritons’ substitute 
senior goalkeeper Grace Vlan -
dis forced into a save almost im -
mediately. In her /f_irst and /f_inal 
appearance at Triton Soccer Sta -
dium, graduating senior Vlandis 
parried a 1-on-1 shot out of play 
for a highlight reel-worthy /f_irst ca -
reer save. Somehow the Mustangs 
could not /f_ind the net on the en -
suing 50th-minute corner, /f_iring 
three shots and hitting the wood -
work twice. 
/T_hree minutes later, however, 
Cal Poly SLO opened the scoring. 
An ambitious cross from 20 yards 
bounced in front of the Mustang 
striker who mishit the ball but did 
just enough to score past Vlandis, who expected a better connection 
on the shot. While Cal Poly SLO 
had opened the half well, the Tri -
tons could count themselves very 
unfortunate to have been beaten 
by such a goal. 
A/f_ter going down 1-0, the Tri -
tons responded extremely well 
and pushed hard to regain their 
standing. An eﬀort by senior mid -
/f_ielder Sophia Bruno in the 63rd 
minute almost tied the match, but 
her shot fell inches wide of the 
post. Fitzgerald came back into 
the game for Vlandis and remark -
ably kept the Mustangs at bay with 
two more incredible diving saves. 
/T_he Tritons’ best chance of the half 
was a shot by Courtney Hilliard in 
the 74th minute. /T_he mid/f_ielder 
cut back onto her right foot from 
25 yards and li/f_ted a ball toward 
the far post. Her eﬀort seemed 
destined for the top corner of the 
net, but a /f_ingertip save denied a 
goal of the season candidate.
/T_he last 10 minutes of the 
game were frantic with the Tri -
tons desperately searching for an 
equalizer. However, the Mustangs 
maintained possession and de -
nied the Tritons any opportunity to score. /T_he game — and the sea -
son — ended in a narrow 1-0 loss 
for UCSD, who watched on as Cal 
Poly celebrated their regular sea -
son title. 
A/f_ter the game, /T_he UCSD 
Guardian spoke with Coach Kris -
tin Jones about the team’s eﬀorts. 
Jones stated, “that was a very in -
spired performance for us against 
the team that won the conference. 
[It was] a very competitive game 
from us, you saw our seniors play 
hard, but you also saw the rest of 
the team play hard for them as 
well, so I’m just really proud of 
the performance. ” Jones also re -
/f_lected on the season, saying, “on 
paper, our record might not have 
been exactly what we wanted it to 
be … but we won or tied half of 
our games, [and] even though it 
doesn’t feel great, [it’s] pretty suc -
cessful considering our strength of 
schedule. ” 
UCSD ends their second sea -
son transitioning to Division I 
with a 2–4–4 record in the Big 
West. /T_he Tritons will return to 
competitive play next August to 
kickoﬀ their 2023 campaign.
What is a Dodger?

by David Kpossou on loop as you 
read this piece.
“/T_he Curse of the Billy Goat, ” 
“/T_he Curse of the Great Bambi -
no. ” /T_hese are mystic legends that 
roam within the halls of baseball 
fame, typically resulting in the af -
fected team to go on long champi -
onship droughts. But, what about 
a franchise like the Dodgers and 
their luck since the 1988 World 
Series? Well, they perhaps suﬀer 
from something a bit worse than 
a curse.
“We play a full season and 
there is a postseason. We are win -
ning the World Series in 2022. 
We are winning the World Series 
this year, put it on record. /T_hat’s 
our focus. /T_hat’s our goal. ” – Dave 
Roberts.
It’s Oct. 15, the year of our Lord 2022. It’s the bottom of the /f_i/f_th in -
ning of game four of the National 
League Division Series with the 
Dodgers facing oﬀ against the Pa -
dres. Tyler Anderson is still on the 
hill. Jurickson Profar at the plate. 
Pop /f_ly to /f_irst baseman Freddie 
Freeman in foul territory. Trent 
Grisham to the plate. Strikeout. 
/T_hen, a/f_ter a two-out walk to Aus -
tin Nola, Ha-Seong Kim grounds 
out on an Anderson to Freeman 
play. Inning over. Anderson and 
the boys in blue walk oﬀ the /f_ield. 
/T_his wasn’t the beginning of 
the end, nor was this the start of 
a brand-new chapter of Dodgers 
history. It was more like the con -
tinuation of a downward spiral. It 
all just felt so familiar, that feeling 
in my chest, I had felt it before. I 
think we all know how this section 
of the downward spiral ends. But 
how did we get here? What even 
is a Dodger?
Firstly, I want to preface that 
this article is not to analyze what 
went wrong with the team speci/f_i -
cally in 2022, because all the an -
swers are obvious: Dave Roberts, 
shaky bullpen, and the hitters get -
ting cold even despite having such 
a star-studded cast, and to oﬀer a solution would be equally as use -
less as well, because we all know 
that the answer will be to throw 
more money at the situation be -
cause it’s /f_inancially possible for 
the Dodgers.
Now, if you had asked me 
prior to 2016 if I liked baseball, I 
probably would’ve laughed and 
proceeded to explain why base -
ball was one of the most boring 
sports on the planet that didn’t 
deserve the right to exist, along 
with its fans. Of course, being 
from Los Angeles, I had to go to a 
Dodgers game at some point, and 
I had gone to exactly two Dodg -
ers games prior to 2016, both day 
games. I knew nothing except that 
I was hot and bored, and thus, a 
distaste for the sport was formed. 
Flash forward to 2016, I told 
myself that I would give baseball 
a try at the beginning of the sea -
son. It was a slow start at /f_irst; I 
was primarily only following the 
standings and keeping track of the 
stats. But then, the World Series 
rolled around, Cubs vs (formerly 
named) Indians. I actually tuned 
in to watch this series, and there 
was just something that really 
clicked for me. I sometimes like to think it’s because I developed 
an actual attention span and could 
enjoy the slow methodical nature 
of the game, the one-on-one duels 
of both skill and wit between the 
pitcher and hitter, and the build of 
stress only to be broken by either 
a routine groundout or homerun. 
But the reality was, I began to 
love baseball because of the mys -
ticism of the sport. /T_he stories of 
the “Curse of the Billy Goat” or 
the “Curse of the Great Bambino. ” 
/T_hat is what got me into baseball; 
what does this have to do with the 
Dodgers’ downward spiral?
I believe the problem with the 
Dodgers is far more mystical than 
some might believe. To say they’re 
cursed would be too strong as 
the team has had success; rather, 
they’re a team suﬀering from the 
degradation caused by greed that 
was completely realized post-
2017, but with roots that date back 
to their move out of Brooklyn to 
Los Angeles. 
/T_he Dodgers, originally a New 
Y ork franchise inhabiting the fa -
mous Ebbets Field, made their 
move to LA in 1958 to play in 
the LA Coliseum. In the present 
day, fans almost take for granted the existence of the Dodgers in 
Los Angeles; they simply couldn’t 
imagine it any other way. Y et, the 
existence of the franchise in LA 
came at the cost of the Brooklyn 
market. From the years 1947 to 
1957, the Dodgers ranked top 
three in attendance every year 
except for three of those years. 
In addition to the attendance, the 
Brooklyn Dodgers, despite their 
abysmal past, having lost seven 
World Series up to that point, /f_i -
nally won a World Series against 
the town rival Y ankees in 1955. 
Only three years removed from 
the most success they had up to 
that point and with the fanbase by 
their side, the Dodgers still chose 
to leave for the prospect of taking 
/f_inancial advantage of the emerg -
ing West Coast markets. Money 
over everything, and this was only 
the beginning. 
Just four years a/f_ter the Dodg -
ers moved to LA, 1962 marked 
the grand opening of Dodger Sta -
dium. To be very blunt, I love this 
stadium. Dodger Stadium feels 
like Disneyland to me. /T_here’s 
just this aura that’s like no other.

Nothing is quite like Blue Heaven. 
Despite its nickname, the creation 
of Dodger Stadium was anything 
but heavenly, very much the op -
posite. /T_he stadium is built on 
stolen land, built on what used 
to be the home to a large com -
munity of working-class Mexican 
Americans before the Los Ange -
les Housing Authority made use 
of eminent domain in order to 
evict anyone who refused to be 
bought out of their home. Some 
fought, trying to hold on to what 
little they had; nonetheless, to no 
avail, Dodger Stadium was built. 
Most nowadays don’t remember 
the inhumane costs it took to 
build that stadium, one of the few 
remembrances of the event is de -
picted in Judy Baca’s “Great Wall 
of LA, ”’ where Dodger Stadium 
is portrayed as an alien spaceship 
landing on Earth as families are 
divided by a freeway and a woman 
is taken away by a police oﬃcer. 
Y ou would think that such a trans -
gression against the Latino com -
munity would drive a large wedge 
between Latinos and the Dodger 
franchise, right? Nope. /T_he Dodg -
ers eventually won back the Mexi -
can market for good through the 
acquisition of Fernando Valenzu -
ela in the ‘80s, resulting in “Fer -
nandomania” – the craze amongst 
Dodger fans for the Mexican-born 
pitcher — and two World Series 
in 1981 and 1988. Two champion -
ships right before the franchise’s 
longest drought.
/T_hrough all this, some may be 
inclined to disregard the politics 
of the Dodgers’ history, focusing 
more on their success since the 
move, citing the /f_ive rings they 
won in the span of 20 years, still 
more than the average franchise 
to this day — thus making the 
Dodgers’ existence in LA justi/f_i -
able. Perhaps, at the time of their 
last championship, all of these 
actions may have been justi/f_iable 
in the name of sporting success, 
but to have gone almost 30 years 
without a championship begins 
to build not only resentment, but 
also decreases just how justi/f_iable 
the suﬀering was, which obviously 
never was valid in the /f_irst place. 
In the years since 1988, other 
teams have done more with less, 
and as each year goes by, things 
get worse and worse, which now brings us to 2017. 2017 marked 
the /f_irst time the Dodgers were 
in the World Series since 1988. 
/T_he 2017 Dodgers were a team of 
franchise-grown players that were 
loved by the fans, consisting of 
personnel like Clayton Kershaw, 
Cody Bellinger, Y asiel Puig, Co -
rey Seager, and Justin Turner — a 
Los Angeles native himself. /T_his 
was a team that /f_inished /f_irst in 
the National League West (NLW) 
with 104 wins, that handedly 
disposed of both the Diamond -
back and Cubs in the NLDS and 
National League Championship 
Series (NLCS), respectively. /T_his 
was supposed to be the Dodg -
ers’ year to end the drought a/f_ter 
consistently being bounced from 
the playoﬀs in the divisional and 
championship series in the 2000s 
and early 2010s. /T_his was sup -
posed to be the year the Dodgers 
won a ring for Vin Scully who 
had just recently retired the year 
before. Everything seemed to be 
in place for the Dodgers, but then 
the Houston Astros happened. 
What followed over the course of 
the next /f_ive years could only be 
best described as the Dodgers suc -
cumbing to their past roots, per -
haps out of desperation, or maybe 
because that’s all they knew. 
2018 saw the Dodgers keep 
the majority of their core but be -
gan what I would argue is the next 
iteration of their degradation into 
greed: the cycle of mercenaries. It 
began when the Dodgers traded 
for Manny Machado a/f_ter con -
ducting a trade with the Orioles. 
At the time it seemed harmless 
enough, one new player in a core 
that was still intact from last year. 
Machado was obviously brought 
in to help the Dodgers win a ring, 
but the entire time it seemed that 
he didn’t want to be there, and it 
showed in his play. Machado bat -
ted below the Mendoza line in 
both the NLDS and World Series 
of that year, which saw the Dodg -
ers fall to the Mookie Betts-led 
Red Sox. Machado eventually le/f_t 
to join the Padres. Another year, 
another failure. On to the next.
2019 felt like a reprieve from 
the /f_irst failed mercenary experi -
ment by the Dodgers, instead opt -
ing to keep the majority of the 
2017 core and relying heavily on 
the recently dra/f_ted and devel -
oped players that made a great 
impact on the roster, featuring the likes of Kyle Garlick, Edwin Rios, 
Gavin Lux, Matt Beaty, Joc Peder -
son, Alex Verdugo, and Will Smith 
(no, not the one that slapped Chris 
Rock — yes, that was a very low-
hanging fruit and I am proud of 
it). If 2017 wasn’t the franchise-
grown team that the Dodgers’ pre -
miere farm system had imagined, 
this was the one. /T_he Dodgers won 
106 games that season and looked 
poised to make their way back to 
the World Series. /T_hat was until 
they ran into the fate-infused Na -
tionals — headed by Max Scherzer 
and Trea Turner — that beat the 
Dodgers in the NLDS and would 
go on to win the World Series that 
year. Another year, another fail -
ure. On to the next.
If 2018 marked the beginning 
of the Dodgers dipping their toes 
in the waters of mercenaries for 
hire, then 2020 would be when 
the Dodgers began to swim in 
the water. 2020 saw the Dodgers 
acquiring Mookie Betts. Mookie. 
Betts. If that name doesn’t ring a 
bell, allow me to remind you that 
Betts was part of the Red Sox team 
that beat the Dodgers. At /f_irst, 
this shocked me, how could the 
Dodgers sign someone from the 
team that defeated them, but it re -
sulted in a World Series for them, 
and while I was happy about that, 
there were doubts. /T_here was un -
certainty that this ring was even 
valid at all given the shortened 
pandemic season, but Dodger 
fans brushed the doubters aside 
and reassured that the next season 
would bring about the same result: 
a World Series.
2021 is when I would say the 
Dodger’s current state, formed by 
the doubts of the previous year, 
their greedy past, and their pre -
vious experiments with merce -
naries, began to take form. /T_he 
Dodgers acquired Trevor Bauer 
from the Reds — which also hasn’t 
had the best turnout given his re -
cent cases of alleged sexual assault 
— and, oh my god … Max Scher -
zer and Trea Turner from the Na -
tionals squad that beat them in the 
NLDS just two years ago. Once 
with Betts was perhaps /f_ine, but 
twice? /T_he Dodgers wanted to en -
sure a World Series at all costs giv -
en the backlash from the previous 
season, so how did they do? /T_hey 
lost to the Freddie Freeman-led 
Braves in the NLCS … you know 
what I’m going to say./T_hus, we arrive to the 2022 
season. Before I go over the Dodg -
ers core updates and season re -
sults, I would like to begin with 
this. If you thought the Dodg -
ers’ transgressions against the 
working class were over a/f_ter the 
Chavez Ravine incident, you are 
wrong: history just likes to repeat 
itself. /T_he Dodgers attempted to 
create a gondola system that trans -
ports fans from Union Station in 
Los Angeles to Dodger Stadium, 
and while that may sound /f_ine 
and dandy, this is considering the 
fact that LA Metro already has a 
FREE SHUTTLE that takes fans 
directly to the stadium all the way 
from the south bay (San Pedro, 
CA) with FEW EXTRA STOPS. 
To have allowed this gondola 
project to go through would have 
essentially disenfranchised any -
thing south of Union Station in 
downtown, which would exclude 
cities with working class fans like 
Huntington Park, South Gate, 
Lynwood, Compton, Carson, and 
San Pedro (which all happen to be 
cities with a massive Latino popu -
lation, oh the irony,) as there is no 
other direct line to the stadium 
but that shuttle. Although this isn’t 
scheduled to happen anymore, it 
became clear where the Dodgers 
stood. /T_hey’ d once again shown 
their true face: the greedy corpo -
ration that uses money and politi -
cal strong-arming to get their way, 
with no regard towards anyone, 
and it re/f_lected in the franchise as 
a whole.
/T_he Dodgers acquired Freddie 
Freeman from the Braves who had 
just beat the Dodgers the year pri -
or. At this point, I couldn’t quite 
take any more of it. /T_his team was 
a far cry from the 2017 squad that 
was basically fully composed of 
franchise-grown talent. Instead, 
we became a team of mercenar -
ies with one goal: win at all costs 
(quite literally). /T_hen, suddenly, 
the Dodger fan base was hit with 
the tragic news that Vin Scully 
had passed away. I was extremely 
saddened by the passing of the 
great broadcaster and was happy 
to see that the Dodgers memorial -
ized Scully in the time that came 
right a/f_ter the news. However, 
a/f_ter some time, it seems that the 
death of Scully became a market -
ing tool for the team to promote 
themselves and their motive for 
winning the World Series. No longer was it the mercenaries win -
ning for the Dodgers out of des -
peration, it was now “Win4Vin, ” 
with what culminated in a playoﬀ 
promotion that featured some of 
the greatest callouts of the broad -
caster. To have used the likeness of 
a dead man for as long as they did, 
struck me as corporate, and from 
an outsider’s perspective, it ap -
peared that Vin was nothing more 
than a tool for the team. Putting 
this small critique of mine aside, 
the 2022 squad would go on to /f_in -
ish /f_irst in the NL West and secure 
a franchise record 111 wins before 
entering the postseason. And /f_i -
nally, we’re back to Oct. 15, 2022.
/T_hus, we come back to the 
question of “what even is a Dodg -
er?” What are the Dodgers if not 
the embodiment of the abuses of 
capitalism, the embodiment of se -
curing victory through /f_inancial 
means, and if even that presents it -
self as a challenge to the franchise, 
then what is a Dodger? It’s the 
embodiment of Los Angeles, its 
history, its politics: its disregard of 
the working-class time a/f_ter time. 
/T_hen, it’s /f_itting that the Dodgers 
chose to have the city’s initials on 
their hats, emblematic of those 
who inhabit the city, those who’ve 
lived there for ages and choose to 
remain, but why? Because, ironi -
cally, much like the team hopes for 
a better future, so do the working 
class who live in LA. Most moved 
to LA generations ago when the 
city was still a beacon of poten -
tial, a city of angels. Even if the 
two groups couldn’t be any more 
diﬀerent, at least the prospect of a 
better future brings them together, 
in moments of happiness, and in 
moments of sadness.
Top of the ninth inning. Last 
out. Freddie Freeman swings and 
misses. /T_he Padres win in the 
NLDS. Another year, another fail -
ure.
“But, you know what, there 
will be a new day, and, eventually, 
a new year, and when the upcom -
ing winter gives way to spring, 
ooh, rest assured, once again it 
will be time for Dodger baseball. ” 
– Vin Scully
On to the next. 
Epilogue: Although I won’t of -
fer any solutions for the 2022 team 
speci/f_ically, I will oﬀer a solution 
to the franchise as a whole: begin 
a new chapter, it’s never too late. 
Make of that as you wish. /uni25B6 WHAT IS A DODGER? , from page 9/gid00042/gid00076/gid00064/gid00070/gid00068/gid00001/gid00066/gid00078/gid00084/gid00081/gid00083/gid00068/gid00082/gid00088/gid00001/gid00078/gid00069/gid00001/gid00044/gid00068/gid00077/gid00001/gid00045/gid00084/gid00077/gid00067/gid00001/gid00085/gid00072/gid00064/gid00001/gid00039/gid00075/gid00072/gid00066/gid00074/gid00081/gid00015
