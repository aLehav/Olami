The 2,300 UCSD students who 
were offered a total of $13 million 
in Cal Grants next year may not be seeing that money anytime soon.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 
newest budget revision attempts to partially solve California’s $24 billion budget deficit by elim-inating over $800 million in funding to the University of California, as well as cut-ting all new Cal Grant awards and halting future award increases for grant renewals.
According to university spokes-
woman Stacie Spector, 7,300 UCSD undergraduates — about one third of the UCSD student body — cur-rently receives about $51 million in Cal Grants.
Under Schwarzenegger’s plan, 
these students would be eligible to continue to receive the grants, though the maximum award would not be increased to compensate for future UC fee hikes. 
Additionally, a public letter 
released by the California Student Aid Commission last Thursday warned that Cal Grant offers for next year are tentative and subject to final approval within the 2009-10 state budget. 5,>:;<+,5;

Construction of the new Student 
Wellness Center has been indef-initely postponed due to lack of funding for the $40 million project.
Originally scheduled for com-
pletion by the 2011-12 academic year, the center is meant to con-solidate the wellness cluster — an interdisciplinary group of student services that includes Counseling and Psychological Services, Student Health Services, the Sexual Assault Resource Center and the Campus Recreation Center — into one all-encompassing facility.
According to Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Student Wellness Karen Calfas, the center hopes to finance construction with private donations. 
“Until we have a substantial 
amount of funding, we can’t even start construction, ” Calfas said. “Since the economy is really strug-gling, that process is not going along at the rate we had anticipated. That will get better. ”
Calfas and Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Penny Rue said that given the unpredictability of fund-ing, there is no way to set a comple-Student Affairs seeks $40 
million in donations; plans to join all student health and wellness services under one roof.

Evicted Student Proves Innocence With Drug Test
Two months after an Earl 
Warren College stu-dent was evicted from 
his Galbraith Hall apartment for an alleged marijuana viola-tion, a judicial board hearing this week cleared him of all charges. However, administrators have indicated no plans to reinstate the student’s residency or issue a formal apology for the mistake.
At a May 27 hearing before 
the Warren College Council Judicial Board, Warren College sophomore Cody Born present-ed hair follicle and urine tests confirming that he had not con-sumed any illicit substances on the night that Residential Security Officer Michael Roake accused Born and his girlfriend — fellow Warren College sophomore Kathy Chou — of smoking marijuana in Chou’s Douglas Hall apartment. 
Born received the eviction 
notice from Warren College Residential Life on March 16 — the Monday of finals week — a few days after Roake confronted Born and Chou at Chou’s apart-ment. 
Born was given 30 days to 
vacate his residence. 
The two students said they 
were watching a movie in Chou’s room on the evening of March 9 when Roake knocked on the apartment door at around 11:30 p.m. When Chou opened the door, Roake claimed to detect the odor of burnt marijuana from inside the apartment.
According to Born and Chou’s 
write-up notices, Roake also said the two students had bloodshot eyes and flushed faces.Born and Chou both denied 
the accusations, and after the pair received write-up notices two days later, Born met with Warren College Assistant Residential Dean Cesar Figueroa to discuss the incident. Figueroa allegedly told Born — who, at the time, was on nonacademic probation for an unrelated alcohol violation that had occurred several months earlier — that there was a good chance he would be evicted from his apartment. 
“ At first I thought that it was 
just a misunderstanding, ” Born

UC President Mark G. Yudof will 
make a 5 percent reduction to his annual salary next month, along with the salaries of all UC chancellors and other top executives, in response to deep systemwide budget reductions.
The pay cut, which was announced 
in an internal letter from Yudof last 
week, will shave less than $1 million from the salaries of about 30 senior 
administrators, including executive and senior vice presidents, execu-tive vice chancellors and the General Counsel (which provides legal ser-vices to the 10-campus system). 
“ Admittedly, this action does not 
have a significant impact on our very serious budget deficit, given its mag-nitude and the fact that UC’s senior management group comprises only a very small fraction of university employees, ” Yudof said in the letter. “Given the magnitude of the budget shortfall, all options need to be con-sidered, and unfortunately, it is likely that every member of the UC com-
munity will be affected negatively. ”
See REGENTS page 3About 30 UC executives, 
including senior admin., will take pay cuts totalling almost $1 million to help fill $531 million deficit.

Grants, w hich have  alrea dy been  
tentatively  offere d to 80,000 stu-
dents state wide, the state  would save  
an estimated $173 million in 2009-
10 and $450 million in 2010- 11.
Spector said that if the Legislature  
approves  the cuts, the university  
would attempt to spread th e impacts 
evenly  throu ghout  the student pop-
ulation, de creasin g the amount  of 
finan cial aid received by all students 
and “signific antly  increasin g the 
amount  that finan cial-aid students 
would be expected to work and bor-
row.” 
Spector add
ed that finan cial-aid 
award packages w ould likely show 
an increase  in private  loans  and a 
growth in unsubsi dized PLU S loans.
“We encoura ge students to bud-
get wisely  and make good de cisions 
in regard to discret
ionary  spen d-
ing, ” Spector said. “A d d itionally , we 
would anticipate  that students m ay 
opt to work more to help  meet costs 
… [They ] will also have  to manage 
work and study time to maintain  
good academic standing and gradu-
ate in a timely man
ner.”For some students, thou gh, extra 
shifts  at the dining hall won’t be 
enou gh to fill the gap left by the 
elimination of the Cal Grant pro-
gram.
“I have  no pare
nts supportin g 
me throu gh college,”  M uir Colle ge 
fresh man Alexandra Chwalik said. 
“Finan cial aid is the only  thin g get-
ting me here , and if Cal Grants w ere 
cut, I w ould have  to take a year  off 
of school  to work full-ti me.”
A.S. V ice Presiden
t of External  
Affairs  Gracelynne  West  expresse d 
the same concern.
“If these  May revision propos-
als pass , I do  not know how m yself  
and countless  others  who depen d 
on the Cal Grant w ill be retaine d 
at the university ,”  West  said. “As a 
low-income, firs
t-generation c ollege 
student, the detrimental c uts to the 
Cal Grant w ill place me at a greater  
disadvanta ge.”
On Monday, UC  Presid ent M ark 
G. Yudof asked the Joint Legislative  
Conferen ce Committ ee to reject  
Schwarzenegger’s prop o
sal, des crib-
ing the devastatin g impact that the 
$800 million in budget cuts would 
have  on the university.He said the cuts would force the 
university to further  reduce fresh-
man enrollm ent, revisit  fee increas-
es for the 2009- 10 academic year  
and implement m ore furlou ghs, lay-
offs and salary  reductions.
“The effect on families under 
$60,000 is really  unb
elievable ,” 
Yudof said in a state ment. “I thin k 
everythin g’s going to suffer , but any-
thin g we put off, like fixing a leaky 
roof , to keep the basic instruc tional  
staff  in place and allow students to 
graduate  on time … [is  what] we’re 
going to be working hardest to pre-
se
rve, and that has to be the highest 
priority. ”
Yudof said that students and 
their families need to be given  more 
notice before  cuts of this severity  
are passed . 
“The long-term solut
ion for our 
econom y is to heighten  invest ment 
in U C, the CSU and the community  
colleges,”  Y udof said. “In the near  
term, unfortunately , the utter  sever-
ity of the cuts propose d leaves us 
only  difficult options  to consi der.”

The final A.S. Council meet-
ing of the year was looked a bit too much like budget 
meeting part deux, as the coun-cil was reminded of budget and funding concerns throughout the evening. 
Associate Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Ed Spriggs gave a 
rather depressing special presen-tation on the reductions that the university - particularly the Student Affairs office - faces in the upcom-ing 2009-10 academic year. 
Next,  
Thurgood  Marshall College senior Sun 
Won “Scooter” Chung  and Sixth 
College junior Christopher  Datilles  lead a presentation detail-
ing the various successes of the two-year old Students Promoted Access Center for Education and Service programs. They also pre-sented the S.P .A.C.E.S. budget for the next academic year.
“Our mission is not to create 
these programs for the sake of creating programs, our mission is to support access and retention, ” Chung said. “This is really a center that works on the holistic idea of improving students’ lives. ” 
Campuswide Senator Adam 
Kenworthy  shared the results of his 
White Board Experiment, during which he sat on Library Walk with a whiteboard last week to collect student input and make A.S. more visible.  
Student feedback included: 
thumbs up for baby Sun Gods and other smaller-scale events that promote campus involvement and sociability; thumbs down for the Justice For All displays; more ‘S’ parking spots; and knowledge of when and where the A.S. meetings take place each week. 
An idea for a likely ongoing 
senator project that resulted from Kenworthy’s experiment is a phone line that would direct students to a voicemail listing the different events taking place throughout the week. The line would be updated by senators on a daily basis. 
The S.P .A.C.E.S. staff did not 
agree with all of the council revi-sions to its charter, so stay tuned 
next year for pos-sible changes to the charter. 
After approv-
ing a slew of funding requests, the coun-cil approved 
the 2009-10 budget for the Sustainability Resource Center, before revisiting the topic of the criteria for Mandated Reserves, which had been tabled last week. After some deliberation, the council determined that the criteria would remain the same. 
Then, it seemed as though 
everyone and their moms tried to get items into New Business. S.P .A.C.E.S. directors and Revelle College Senator Arvind 
Satyanarayan  were all appointed 
with little drama. 
Vice President of External 
Affairs Gracelynne West  attempt-
ed to submit two resolutions into New Business around the time that the lights went out in the forum. The meeting continued in semi-darkness for about half an hour before Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs Jordan Taylor  
humanely made a motion to dis-charge the resolutions to commit-tee, putting an end to the evening.

UC Berkeley has already laid off 
over 80 employees since the begin-ning of the year, and UCSD is slow-ly moving in the same direction. according to UCSD spokeswoman Stacie Spector.
“We have had some layoffs in the 
last few months and expect more in the next couple of months, ” Spector said in a statement.
Yudof ’s letter arrives on the 
heels of a legislative proposal draft-ed by State Senators Leland Y ee (D-San Francisco/San Mateo) and Roy Ashburn (R-Bakersfield) last Wednesday to strip the university of immunity from legislative control. The senators cited recent pay hikes for UC executives as one of the rea-sons they introduced the measure. 
Y ee, however, said the executive 
pay cut is too little, too late. 
“We still need to move forward 
with a ballot measure that will rein them in, ” Y ee said in a statement. “We already have people who are being furloughed, who are taking pay cuts, and [the University of California] should have led the way a long time ago. ”
UC chancellors receive an aver-
age salary of $312,400 a year, and Yudof earns a base salary of $591,000 annually. 
Before the 5 percent cuts, UCSD 
Chancellor Marye Ann Fox received $382,416 a year. 
Released late last month, Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger’s revised bud-get includes a $1.5 billion cut to high-er education, $531 million of which would come from the UC system.

Dear Editor,
In light of the May 31 federal 
court ruling prohibiting the dispersal 
of the harbor seal colony from Casa 
Beach, I would like to encourage 
the UCSD community to express its support of the seals’ right to stay at their longtime home in La Jolla. Last week Superior Court Judge Yuri Hoffman ruled for the removal of the seals to create a children’s bathing pool, demonstrating the unfortunate tendency to place relatively unim-portant human interests above the survival needs of another species. Deb Saracini of the La Jolla Friends of the Seals, a public awareness and seal advocacy group, told me that the har-bor seals — whose community now numbers about 200 — have lived here since at least the 19th century. She explained that if the seals were forced 
off the beach, they would lose their 
place to rest on dry land — which is necessary to their survival, especially that of the 46 baby seals. 
Now, thanks to the federal court 
ruling, a restraining order to protect the seals is in effect. They will not be “dispersed” by recorded dog barking 
noises (the originally proposed plan). 
The restraining order is part of a bill currently awaiting hearing in the State Assembly which would leave the City Council to decide the seals’ fate. Only councilmember Sherri Lightner favors the dispersion of the seals. We are lucky to have such spectacular wildlife right here in La Jolla. Being able to view these wild animals live 
and play in their natural habitat is 
a privilege of which we should all take advantage. Please express your approval of protecting the seals by e-mailing members of the San Diego City Council and telling them how you feel.

When discussing stu-
dent rights, it’s easy to get caught in the flow-
ery rhetoric of concepts like justice, equal representation and a slew of other democratic buzzwords that look damn good on picket signs, T-shirts and campaign buttons. 
It’s rare, though, that students get 
the opportunity to feel the burn of disenfranchisement. Generally, we’re afforded more rights than we even know. 
Y et a prime example of injustice 
— real life, stripped-of-your-rights, kicked-to-the-curb injustice — has been right underneath our noses since each of us began our college careers here at UCSD. The source: our campus housing contract.
Amid four pages of waivers, 
guidelines, regulations and notices, the contract contains a single line that allows the university to evict its campus tenants at any time without any formal reason. 
By agreeing to the contract, stu-
dents effectively sign away their rights to due process, bestowing upon the university complete con-trol over the status of their residency. 
In a perfect world — where 
administrative mistakes and the behavioral shortcomings of bloated residential officials are nonexistent — this arrangement wouldn’t be too troubling. 
Y et administrators make mis-
takes, and sometimes they even — gasp! — abuse their power. 
Just last quarter, a student 
was evicted from his Earl Warren College apartment based solely on the testimony of a Residential Security Officer, who claimed the student displayed symptoms of mar-ijuana consumption in an exchange between the two. 
At a judicial-board hearing two 
months after his removal from cam-pus, the student presented drug tests proving that he had not engaged in the use of any illicit substances. 
It would require a unique stub-
bornness to claim that this incident doesn’t indicate a flaw in our hous-ing system’s infrastructure. Students are being evicted without the oppor-tunity to defend themselves and punished without any proof of mis-conduct.
It doesn’t end there. Write-ups are 
issued based on the same principles: convict first, ask questions never. And when questions are asked, it’s usually too late — as in the case of the aforementioned Warren College student.
Th is contract must be thoroughly 
reexamined. 
Students deserve the right to 
defend themselves against charges that harm their reputations and our administrators should be obligated to provide this right.   ?IV\:MIT1VR][\QKM':MIL\PM0W][QVO+WV\ZIK\.QVM8ZQV\EDITORIALS

:OV\SK:H]L[OL:LHSZIf there’s one thing our iso-lated campus is good for, it’s ignoring the nitty-gritty of the 
real world and drifting off in our dreamy collegiate paradise. After all, when the only real effects of California’s tanking economy visible to students are reduced hours at the UCSD Bookstore, it’s easy to forget the whole billion-dollar state deficit thing.
But now that Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger has released a budget that will burn a $531 mil-lion dollar-hole in the University of California’s 2009-10 budget, our cozy four-year bubbles are finally threat-ening to burst.
Come fall, when we’re freed from 
our coffee-fetching intern duties to make the trek back to UCSD, our academic instruction — not to men-tion practically every other useful service or program on campus — will be undeniably impacted.
UC President Mark G. Yudof said 
it himself. Schwarzenegger’s budget will force the university to raise stu-dent fees, increase class sizes and cut academic offerings.
Your professors will feel it too — pay cuts and furloughs for UC employees are by no means out of the question.
Though major cut decisions will 
have to wait until specifics trickle down from the powers that be over the next couple of months, some departments have already decided to shrink class offerings for the Summer Sessions and Fall Quarter. The Division of Arts and Humanities — which relies less on private grants than other departments — will endure an exceptionally painful bud-getary burn, and classes with lower enrollment (such as language cours-es) will be especially vulnerable to the chopping block.Until a serious game of telephone 
goes down between Yudof, the UC campus chancellors, the academic divisions and their departments, the severity of the cuts are uncertain. But one thing’s for sure: no matter how many eucalyptus trees you duck under, next year there’s no avoiding the apocalypse.

As student fees rise and the American job market crum-bles, it’s easy for environmen-
tal issues to take a backseat in the average Triton’s daily routine. But fortunately, we can tackle both our financial and environmental wor-ries through everyday conservation methods. Individually speaking, the behavioral changes are small, but when a larger body — such as the UCSD community — adopts them, they add up. The adjustments I’ve made can both fatten your wallet and give you a clean environmental 
conscience.
My methods include:
1) Lowering my energy bill by 
conserving energy. Turn off your power strip or unplug your cell phone and laptop chargers when you’re not using them to prevent phantom loads (energy consumed when the power is turned off). According to the U.S. Department of Energy, 75 percent of the electricity used to power home electronics is consumed while they are turned off.
To maximize savings with a 
laptop, put your AC adapter on a power strip that can be turned off; the transformer in the AC adapter draws power continuously, even if the laptop is not plugged into the adapter.
If you don’t have them yet, get 
compact fluorescent light bulbs. According to Energy Star, a gov-ernment-backed program that rates energy efficiency, a CFL will save about $30 over its lifetime and pay for itself in about six months. It uses 75 percent less energy and lasts about 10 times longer than an incandescent bulb.
2) Conserving water — San Diego 
imports 90 percent of its water from 
the Colorado River and Northern California. Start by turning off the tap when you’re washing dishes or soaping up in the shower. And turn off the water when you’re brushing your teeth or scrubbing your hands. According to the San Diego Water Authority, it saves about three gallons per day.
3) Disposing of bottled water and 
replacing it with a reusable water bottle and tap water (or filtered tap water). Though a 16-ounce bottle of water costs about $1, you can get the same amount in tap water for a few pennies.
4) Checking my tire pressure. The 
higher it is, the better fuel mileage you’ll see — meaning fewer fill-ups and more money in your pocket. Y ou can also improve mileage by clearing out the junk in your trunk, 
because a heavier load leads to lower 
gas mileage. Consuming less gas also reduces air pollution (20.8 pounds of carbon dioxide are emitted into the atmosphere for every gallon of fuel consumed). 
Whether financial or environ-
mental, we’re all part of a commu-nity using the same pool of resources. Acknowledging that we have limited 
supplies enables us to consume more 
responsibly while both preserving the environment and saving our hard-earned cash.(SILY[3\VUN

We have yet to deal with it in an open and honest way. Every time there’s a budget shortfall, the student-fee increase is on the table. We have no choice but to raise fees and we sit around, wring our hands and worry about it. I don’t think the response ought to be just increase fees and nothing more and hope next year will be better. We look at this every year as unique, but it’s not unique.

Like nothing before it, nothing since; until now, half a millennium later, when the shake-stuffs of Earth’s most bangin’ population can finally thrive as intended: in the crests and dips of motherfucking reggaeton.

www.sdccd.edu - (619) 388-6500said. “I e-mailed Cesar and said, ‘It’s 
just a mistake, right? This is going to be taken off? I asked him a bunch of questions and he just said ‘No, this eviction notice is final, there’s nothing I can do about it. ’ That’s all he said. ”
Born attempted to take the 
question up with Warren College Residential Dean Claire Palmer. However, when he met with Palmer, she told him the decision to terminate his tenancy would stand.
“She was kind of sympathetic 
toward me, ” Born said. “She was like, ‘Y eah, I’m really upset about this, too, but there’s nothing we can do about it. ’ I was kind of shocked that there are no checks and balances. Just because one guy is power-tripping, now nobody else can fix what his mistake is. I just don’t see how that’s right. ” 
Additionally, Chou’s roommate 
signed a statement claiming responsi-bility for the marijuana odor. She said that Born and Chou should be cleared of any charges.
“Someone actually stepped for-
ward and took responsibility for everything that that happened that night, ” Chou said. 
Despite Chou’s roommate’s tes-
timony, Figueroa told Chou and Born that the citations would not be revoked.
After opting to appeal the decision, Born and Chou underwent hair-follicle and 
urine tests to prove their innocence. According to medical records pro-vided by the pair, the results of the tests came back negative, con-firming that Born and Chou had not consumed marijuana on the night that Roake confronted them at Chou’s apartment.
Born said he spent over $100 on 
the two tests. The hair-follicle test that Born took is regularly used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and can detect any marajuana con-sumption that has occurred in the three months prior to the test. 
“I specifically went to the drug 
testing place and asked them, ‘What is going to prove that I’m innocent?’” Born said.
According to the WCC Judicial 
Board’s record of Born’s case, Warren College Assistant Residential Dean Sean McCarty attended Born’s hear-ing last week, acting as UCSD’s rep-resentative and the complainant in the case. 
McCarty — who at the time of 
the hearing was unaware that Born had undergone the two drug tests — accused Born of being under the influence of marijuana on the night he and Chou were written up by Roake. 
Later in the hearing, Roake — also 
unaware of Born’s drug tests — fur-ther alleged that Born’s breath had smelled of marijuana during their March 9 encounter. This detail was not included in the write-up that Roake submitted on March 14 regard-ing the incident.
“What’s funny is that he didn’t 
know I had the drug test taken, ” Born said. “So it’s kind of like he’s just try-ing to go along with the stories and kind of make up more just to ensure that I’m held responsible, that I’m guilty. ”
After A.S. Associate Vice 
President of Student Advocacy Frank Carroll —who was acting as Born’s representative — produced the drug test results, McCarty questioned their validity.
“He said that the urine test had 
too much variance, ” Chou said. “Then Cody said, ‘Well, I have a hair test. ’ For the hair test, he questioned how he could tell it was really Cody’s hair in the sample. ”
Later in the trial, McCarty 
changed his position to claim that Born may have been a guilty party despite not having consumed any illicit substances.
“ At the very end of the hearing he 
resorted to saying, ‘Oh, I’m not try-ing to say that Cody smoked weed, ’” Chou said. “He said it could be pos-sible that Cody was aiding someone in smoking weed or he was just about to light up. They just kind of pointed at a bunch of other things that had nothing to do with what they were charging him with, because the drug test pretty much proved that he didn’t do anything. ”
Born was officially charged for 
violations of the controlled substanc-
es agreement contained in section 
22.16.10.30 of the UCSD Student Conduct Regulations and the resi-dential smoking policy within section 22.16.10.16 of the same document. 
Though the violations were 
removed from his record, the uni-versity refuses to reinstate Born’s resi-dency.
The housing contract all UCSD students sign when moving onto campus contains a clause 
that allows the university to termi-nate a student’s tenancy at any time, without cause, provided the student is allowed 30 days to vacate the resi-dence. 
The contract also gives the univer-
sity the right to terminate a student’s residency with only three days’ notice “under any circumstances allowed by law. ”
“That termination has nothing 
to do with whether or not the stu-dent actually did anything, ” Student Legal Services attorney Jon Carlos Senour said. “That’s really the issue. … Because of the fact that the lan-guage doesn’t require finding a viola-tion of the legal code, legally speaking it’s OK. ”
Senour said this type of arrange-
ment is common in most tenant-land-lord relationships within the commer-cial housing sector.
“The one concern that students 
typically have is that obviously there’s an unequal bargaining power between the student and the univer-sity, ” Senour said.
Born said the contract should be 
altered to require more investigation into the circumstances surrounding a student’s eviction.
“It shouldn’t be up to just one 
person, one person’s opinion, wheth-er you’re guilty or not, whether you should be evicted or not, ” Born said.
A.S. Associate Vice President of 
Student Advocacy Frank Carroll said students should be entitled to a fair hearing before being evicted.
“There’s no due process, ” Carroll 
said. “In our system of values and our system of justice, the idea that you can get kicked out before you’re even given an opportunity to have your case heard makes no sense. Everything in the student conduct code and the housing contract should be based on a presumption of innocence. That’s a fundamental value in the whole American system of justice. ”
A.S. Campuswide Senator Bryant 
Pena — who himself was evicted from his Warren College apartment in April — said Born’s case indicates a fundamental flaw in the campus housing contract.
“There are no ifs, ands or buts, ” he 
said. “There’s nothing in this contract that requires the university to prove anything; it just says the university can terminate this contract. What that essentially allows for is punishment without due process. ”
During his bid for a senatorial 
position on the A.S. Council this spring, Pena promised to work toward a more just housing contract for stu-dents. He said he will use Born’s case as a starting point for this effort. 
“This is a landmark in our fight for 
student rights, ” he said. “It shows that this is a flawed system that allows for unjust punishment. ”
However, Associate Director of 
Housing Services Jana Severson said the contract is fair in its current form.
“ A contract is a contract, ” she 
said. “It allows for a series of [condi-tions] that either can be broken by the university or by the resident. … Our contracts are fairly standard in landlord-tenant law … so I think the contract stands as a document and serves well. ”
Carroll said the university should 
attempt to foster a better relationship with students than one based solely on contractual obligation.
“Y ou need to have it one way or 
another, ” Carroll said. “If you’re going to be a landlord, then get the RAs out of there, get the RSOs out of there, and start trusting people to abide by the code of conduct. If you’re going to be a parent … then you need to start acting that way. ... Y ou’ve got people transitioning from structured life to independent life … It needs to be better than a landlord-tenant relationship, because it’s a relation-ship of student and their institution, their school. ”
Director of Student Policies and 
Judicial Affairs Tony Valladolid said

SOAPBOX 
TRADITION
TAKES A TURN 
FOR THE FUNK 
Ifear I have brought great shame 
upon my ancestors.
Traditionally, the Guardian ’s 
incoming editor in chief taps out a hello/goodbye piece for the strictly annual “Editor’s Soapbox” fixture in the second-to-last issue of the year, an 
indulgent little guy which everyone 
scans for shout-outs and promptly dis-regards along with the rest of the Focus section (sorry Dave).
Of course, being the shackle-bust-
ing rebel I’ve always been — and seeing that I somehow missed the parting thunderclouds and completely forgot until last night that this sacred torch-passing ritual existed, and was in fact now mine to uphold — my bastardly arts-and-entertainment column will have to bend its wet ‘n’ wild all-things-artsy theme to pick up the pieces.
I guess it’s time to admit that 
“Straighter Than Narrow” never really had a theme. The first installment was more an excuse to cry about losing all my music in an external-hard-drive catastrophe, alongside a review of a John Lennon documentary in which I accidentally switched the last names of two very important and very hip historical figures who will now remain unnamed, lest I screw it up again and tally a strike two upon their angry SIMONE  ELECTRA  WILSON

INDEPENDENCE JAMFM 94/9
Yeah Y eah Y eahs, Metric, Black Keys and Dead 
Confederate — all for $30. Say no more. In no place but San Diego and the smallest of desert 
towns could you stumble across a better lineup for a few bucks and a handful of change. As flagships of the indie scene, each headlining act is known for infectious live performance and full-throttle soul dug deep from garage-band beginnings. 
YYY, in particular, pretty much seal the deal: the NY 
trio’s latest album, It’s Blitz!, garnered four-star reviews 
across the board and earned major cred for its sensual, introspective dance jams set to Karen O’s glam theatrics. Metric — promoting their own pitch-perfect Fantasies 
— make a steamy appetizer, busting out a serving of synth-
pop gently soothed by Emily Haines’ crystalline larynx. Throw in the bluesy Black Keys and down-home grungers Dead Confederate, and you’ve got a bona fide good time. If you’re heading to the sold-out show, bring your whole fam-ily — little ones under three get their music education free. 
FM 94/9 Independence Jam: Coastal Invasion will be 
held at the Oceanside Pier Amphitheater on June 7 .

(PROM)ISCUOUS
with Zion I & LAZRtagCURE NOONTIME BOREDOM WITH NIGHTS OF PUNK POWER CHORDS, LO-FI FOLK AND SOME SWEET PIANO KEYS TO SUGAR YOUR LEMONADE
Kick up your heels and shine them shoes — A.S. is set to round out the year with (insert eyeroll) Senior PROMiscuous. Featuring 
“City of Dope” hero Zion I and lesser-known LAZRtag as openers, the campus dance party PROMises to be, according to the PEG booklet, “that prom you saw in corny teen movies and never had. ” Silver tinsel, screechy cheerleaders and horny jocks? Oh, boy. 
At least Zion I’s slick rhymes and mashup-
military synths burn a brand that’s a little more legit. The same can’t be said for the LAZRtag team, a house duo as generic as apple pie. Too bad we could only afford Girl Talk once. Expect club beats, bubble dresses and a whole lotta underage fresh-meat — if that’s your thing. 
But hey, even if it’s a bit of a limp hand-
shake for soon-to-be alumni, it’s an honest 
effort. Just tag it as a free pre-party for finals week, wander on over from the pub 
and get down with your bad side. Next week, you can hold your own keg stand.
PROMiscuous will be held at the 
Price Center West Ballroom on June 4.

Associate Hiatus EditorGRIZZLY BEAR
■ 21st Century Breakdown
REPRISE
If the little-known genre of steam-punk were as cool as I want it to be — not the medio-cre goth sect it is in real Wikipedia life — 
if steam-punk’s telescopes, time machines and open-gear compasses were rubbed with varnish and made to glint, the whole scene would belong only to Grizzly Bear.
It’s painful to group the Brooklyn quartet 
with the lately overcrowded indie-rock circle of church-choir atmospheraholics like Fleet Foxes, My Morning Jacket and Bon Iver — though they do have plenty of that going on. But where Daniel Rossen’s lead vocals may at first seem to reverberate like the rest, they are in fact cupped and drop-shadowed in the sliver of a bandmate’s own rising solo. Discipline and restraint lend an inner metal-weight to the band’s antique varnish, setting them apart from nervous classmates who do gypsy impressions whenever things get slow.
All slowness aside, Grizzly Bear have a new 
nonproblem with likeability. The more nuanced and intricate they grow as musicians, the more accessible the sum of their parts. If you’re will-ing to re-imagine your wildest dreams at their excruciating pace, there’s no avoiding an addic-tion to the sparser heartbeat of a perfect machine — blooping and churning without a single unin-tentional groan of wear. The men behind the machine, of course, are blistering their fingers with tiny gears to keep the beat square and punky while preserving the steam in the crannies of the stained-glass Mother Mary above.
Fortunately, Veckatimest  gets its most pain-
fully gorgeous moments over with early on. Second-track single “Two Weeks” enters coyly on Devotchka piano toes, one grumpy bass striking a beat that never warms, bruising a boardroom finger-tap that zips across a choice chunk of keyboard to lend the song its entire sense of orbit. Drizzle on the merciless altar-boy peels of Rossen, and the grounded bass and pebbly drums are lifted to the slightest of hovers — one we’ d rather break than bear its prettiness. 
The majority of Veckatimes t’s remainder 
is stocked with awkward, seemingly free-jazz moments that plod to a formula we have no chance of pinning, every other track an “I’ve Just Seen a Face” to keep us from suffocating on the “Y esterday”s. 
That compositions so embellished in cymbal, 
so hung in light and tinsel, and with a soul to their swirl that rivals Shuggie Otis, can still feel so first-man essential — a single drop of African sweat — is a barely-there fruit of the greatest labor.
Grizzly Bear will perform live in Los Angeles 
at the Wiltern on June 19.

RISE AGAINST
Self-proclaimed hardcore kids Rise Against have already proven they can throw a kick-ass lawn party — they shared Warped’s 
main stage with punk revivalists Billy Talent in ’06, and raged with Alkaline Trio before that. Now returning alongside Talent and veteran screamers Rancid on July 10, we can expect the same string-shredding crunch that made Rise boss on 2006’s The Sufferer & the Witness. 
Fair warning: The PETA-loving, anti-estab-
lishment vegans preach and pout about as much as they actually play. But when they do get down to business, they skid close to Bad Religion’s skater genius with no shortage of cymbal crash-es and amp-rattling power chords. Vocalist Tim McIlrath has a beaten-raw voice, and stadium choruses chuck any tacit pretention straight into the mosh pit. 
Are they the best in the business? Probably not 
— overbrushed Appeal to Reason  lacks the depth 
that made Sufferer so beautifully plaintive, and 
some tracks are barely discernible. Still, a night of sweaty, animalistic thrashing is worth 35 bucks. 
Rise Against will perform live at the San

Oh, come on. Y ou know Coldplay. “Viva la Vida”  of iTunes-exclusive fame? Y ou’ve 
heard “Y ellow, ”  like, at least 43 times. The 
“alternative” Brit band won the Grammy this year for best rock album and snagged the No. 1 Billboard spot in 2008, despite lukewarm critical reviews. And with millions of hysterical fans per-petually at their feet, it makes sense: Their polite yet soaring piano rock (not to mention dreamy frontman Chris Martin) makes for a bloody bril-liant commercial sensation.
Plus, Coldplay’s concerts tend to be a lot like 
Death Cab’s recent surprisingly rockin’ RIMAC show. Lush tracks like “The Scientist” unfold seizure-inducing lightshows and show-stopping gimmicks. Word is, they’ve got confetti butter-flies. Tons.
Coldplay will perform live at the Cricket

DAY
Heads up, losers: At a cou-ple secret shows in San Francisco, Green Day pre-
viewed their upcoming tour, play-ing recent rock opera 21st Century 
Breakdown  in its entirety — all 
three epic acts and 18 tracks, from start to finish. Any other band near-ing mid-life crisis might crash and burn in dusty glory, but let’s face it: Green Day — even with guyliner — kick ass. 
They’ve come a long way. 
Pot-smoking “green days” at Berkeley and masturbation anthems have been treated with politically charged variants on the Bush-bashing theme. The 
latest streamlined ditties aren’t 
quite Rage Against the Machine, but they pack enough punk to satisfy enthusiasts. And with tracks like “East Jesus Nowhere” — decidedly riotous celebrations of Bible-bashing — lead sing-er Billie Joe Armstrong packs enough controversy to fuel a pumped-up performance. Add a killer mosh pit, a hormonally charged crowd and a few whiffs of Mary Jane, and you’re set to thrash out the night. 
Green Day will perform live at 
the Cox Arena on August 20.

graves. Alas, that is the kind of shame 
that amasses when a ditzy and undeserving sophomore, still working through the kinks of her humble hip-hop writing — rather hilariously, considering her nonexistent background in rapping/being black or poor — gets ditched by a dashing graduating staff of aspiring Lester Bangses. Boo.
Then there was the bedazzled install-
ment about the great, empty cultureless-ness of Las Vegas, in which I reflected on the Guardian ’s annual weekend of 
sin. Pleasant in theory, until I was struck with my 1 a.m. Hiatus-diety obligation to spiral into a cussy, big-headed lecture on how the Roots are awesome guys with big souls and therefore don’t belong perform-ing in such a soulless pit as Vegas.
OK, most embarrassing moment in 
“Straighter Than Narrow” history: the one in which I already said goodbye. There is no awkwardness like that of kissing everyone in the room a tearful farewell — maybe even squeezing a butt cheek and admitting you always had a thing for them, because you only live once and there’s no time like the present — and then having to slink back momentarily because you forgot your car keys. Especially when you catch them all talking shit.
Anyway, I left in a huff at the dawn of 
2008, one year and a quarter into my reign as Hiatus editor. Upon not being able to recall a single thing I had learned in any class or done outside the Guardian office — like, hm, get laid while I still had elastic skin cells and a spine that could straighten after 24 hours in a chair, maybe sometime before the fluorescents shriveled me into an old wrinkled kelp with nothing but my muffy comfort-headphones for protection — I decided to get the hell out.
Now, apparently, I’m back, far from 
being able to pretend it’s my “basket-weav-ing” major that’s keeping me here an entire fifth year, once again bidding my goodbye to the current staff (and to gloomy-ass spring quarter, damn it all). Even though there’s a whole year left — one that looks to be Cal Grant free, woopee, even less bank to feed my parking-ticket addiction — it’s definitely the end of an era. But hello as well, to all you who’ll be around next year to grudgingly peruse our mandatory college publication, our foldable path-lining literature to test against your own wits and educated guesses. 
To stick with at least one tradition, 
I’ll wind this end-of-the-year tissue into something (albeit sort of shoddily) enter-tainment related: My very own dedication ’graph, FM-style, to all those who have led me to where I am today. Consider me Delilah if she hadn’t found God.
Chuck Berry to Pop, Graceland  to Mom 
on the Indian rug. “Just a Girl” to elemen-tary school, where I lip-synched it in the talent show and realized I had no talent, but learned how to love myself some goddamn Gwen Stefani. It pains me to say a guy got me into hip-hop, and pretty much strips me of all street cred (you know, the kind I’ve been building at this esteemed institu-tion), but Nick was it. So “Strawberry” to Nick, and all that silly Brother Ali shit too. We were cute. My freshman-year dungeon was no place for dance party, so fifth-year Knife to Sari and Melody, because it was to “Heartbeats” on the room’s single floppy chair that I learned to dance party. Then “She’s having a baby, ” to be funny. “Give the Drummer Some” to Cody, my first editor, and maybe “Strawberry 23, ” because for the entire world of songs you showed me, it felt good to give a couple back. “What Y ou Know” to Charles, best managing editor ever to touch my reads, an Asian duckling born in the ATL in another life. “La Lata” to Felipe, who I landed on when I fled to Latin America and who still keeps me sane on Skype with all the newest and dirti-est cumbia, and “La Dueña del Swing” to Sebastian, the only guy I’ve ever wanted to dance with. And to next year’s staff, my beautiful little kumquats — I won’t tell you your dedication until we go to fucking Asian karaoke already.
Sucks. I guess now that I’m editor, there’s 
no one left in the uppermost hierarchal rung to prevent me from dedication ’graphs like the motherload above. Alyssa and Reza, it’s up to you: Please, hold me back.

Marilyn Manson
■ The High End of Low
INTERSCOPE
Dear Marilyn Manson,
Please don’t gut me and hang me by my intes-
tines for saying I didn’t like your new album.
It’s not that you’ve mellowed with age: “We’re From 
America” drips with contempt, seething with lines like “We don’t believe in credibility/ Because we know that we’re fucking incredible. ” Grinding guitars drench you in industrial sludge, and there’s that ice-cold sneer (you must’ve spent hours practicing in front of the mirror). 
But then you start repeating yourself on five-minute 
tracks only half-filled with content. “ Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon, ” is a dangerously slow jam, with blank-faced delivery feebly stabbing at twisted, aborted pop. But while the track isn’t a head-banger, it’ll pass for your minions — unlike the video. That cacophony of self-indulgent clips of you as a hooded outcast molds over faster than a body six feet under. 
“We’re from America” lacks Mechanical Animals’
serial-killer edge, just regurgitated sludge of those firey, hot-button controversies you once devoured with such irreverence and uncompromising satire.
 Manson you don’t have to scream “FUCK!” to get 
my attention. All I need is some slow, solid head bang-ing. It’s really too bad the tickets aren’t worth it anymore — or the gas it would take to road-trip north.
Marilyn Manson will perform live at the Glen Helen 
Pavillion in San Bernadino on July 12.

Esmee Denters
■ Outta Here
TENMAN , UNIVERSAL  NL
Not since Lonelygirl15 has Y ouTube birthed a star as eye-catching as Esmee Denters. (Let’s face it: Marie Digby’s Rihanna spiel stopped at one-hit wonder.) 
Aside from the Dutch darling’s toothy, Hannah 
Montana-watt smile, she has the vocal chops to save her from little-girl syndrome. It makes sense, then, that white knight Justin Timberlake would come to her rescue: How gracious, how kind of him to pluck out a no-name protege and make her princess of his new record label — just like daddy Prince and his long list of suckling babes (ahem, Bria Valente). Props to Denters, who’s hopped on the pumpkin chariot headfirst — Outta 
Here  takes tracks from JT, One Republic frontman Ryan 
Tedder and hitmaker Palow da Don. 
Too bad her vocals take a backseat to primping and 
posing; in her debut, the almost-21-year-old takes care to flaunt every curve. The title track and first single is the most blatant case in point: Denters rocks the best big hair and makeup money can buy. Even without watch-ing the video clip, we can tell. Perfume oozes from the curl-flipping echo “Get me outta here/ Here/ Here. ” It’s standard procedure, as is JT’s pumped-up guest appear-ance on a couple flat tracks. 
“Love Dealer” takes uninspiration to the max, eking 
out an overproduced Hilary Duff B-side. And for every silky smooth, funkadelic track (“ Admit It”), there’s a bal-lady stepchild lurking in the corner: On “Getting Over Y ou, ” she wails about failing to do so over the same five-note sequence.
It’s hard to blame the copycat; she’s unashamed-
ly clutching JT as her guide. But even the prophetic Mouseketeer’s ultra-polished production can’t save bleached-out harmonies and sinking hooks. While skintight autotuning might trounce other wannabes, Denters’ Mariah-style vocals need to break free — only then will we hear what Y ouTube’s number-one star is really capable of.

Public En emies” is set in America’s bullet-holed mobster era, when 
legends like Al Capone dominated the headlines and an endless 
stream of devilish gangsters with slick nicknames seized the public’s 
imagination. Against the Great Depression’s slump, “Enemies” paints iconic bank robber John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) in an epic battle of wits against federal agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale).
With Depp’s acting chops and Bale’s blockbuster-dazzled past — on 
top of a premise that’s so authentically American it’s almost unpatri-otic to criticize — “Enemies” is a surefire crowd-pleaser. Although, audiences have likely been oversaturated with mobster flicks by now, it seems doubtful that gratuitous violence, car chases, sex and period costumes will ever grow old.
— Imran Manji
Staff Writer“PUBLIC ENEMIES”Yet another Disney spy flick, “G-Force” softens gun-toting intensity with a bin full of guinea pig fuzz. Commmanding pig Agent Darwin (Sam Rockwell) 
leads a gang of archetypal rodents that includes sexy Latina Juarez (Penelope Cruz) and fast-talkin’ thug Agent Blaster (Tracy Morgan). Their mission: save the world from one billionaire villain’s schemes to rull the planet. 
Of course, there are also robots and fist-sized explosions, 
and probably a joke about pet supplies somewhere in the mix. But why watch “G-Force” (in Pixar’s new 3-D technology, no less) when you can rent “Spy Kids” and kick back on your 
couch? Save the money and buy a $3 hamster instead.

On the arthouse wire, Coppola’s come-back hasn’t exactly been peachy. After his decade-long hiatus, “Y outh Without 
Y outh” surfaced belly-up; for anyone hop-ing “Tetro” will be better, Cannes’ consensus remains as divided as the Korean peninsula.  
Since flipping off studios and ditching 
Hollywood in the mid ’90s, Coppola has been gearing up to personally finance his films — growing grapes in Northern California, plant-ing resort villas in Costa Rica and backing both literary-arts magazine “Zoetrope All-Story” and production company American Zoetrope. But for all his success with capital ventures, the Godfather has failed to strike gold with any recent blockbusters.
Set in a black-and-white Buenos Aires, 
“Tetro” rings like an amateur screenwright’s first shot: a brotherly drama about the dark secrets of an immigrant Italian family. Whether or not the film can revive Coppola’s crowning glory, one thing’s certain — he doesn’t have far to fall.

Perhaps the only shortfall of “ Away We Go”— it’s a tad too Whole 
Foods-wholesome for its own good. A road trip romantic comedy starring John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph, the film guarantees 
your healthy dose of summer sap in one convenient serving — co-author Dave Eggers weilding the heartfelt prose he mastered in 2002’s lightly fic-tionalized memoir “ A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. ”
For once, it seems “ American Beauty” director Sam Mendes has finally 
found a family he can sympathize with. “Go” focuses on a pair of naive 30-somethings in search of the perfect place to raise their child and, in turn, grow up a little themselves. With a solid supporting cast, the comedy will likely be what “Juno” couldn’t: a realistic take on unplanned parent-hood, sans Michael Cera’s awkward overkill.

It’s happened: Judd Apatow’s gone deep. He’s 
no longer writing about awkward 40-year-old virgins, unprotected sex or teenage coitus 
— instead, “Funny People” observes the not-so-funny lives of everyday goofballs Seth Rogan and Adam Sandler.
Sandler plays a seasoned comedian with less than 
a year to live. After being diagnosed with a terminal disease, the frowny-faced funnyman copes with his looming fate by cracking a slew of death jokes. 
Undoubtedly, some audiences will have trouble 
embracing the film’s darker turns. Apatow told the press, “I’m trying to make a very serious movie that is twice as funny as my other movies. ” We just hope the film has enough of the Emmy-winning pro-ducer’s witty vulgarity to make Sandler as hilarious as he deserves to be.

If you’ve ever woken up in a trashed room, lightly speckled with vomit, aching from last night’s debauchery, you’ll probably find the sopho-moric misadventures in “The Hangover” pure comedic genius.
Long ago, some dudes couldn’t find their car — now, they can’t find 
their dude. They’re in Las Vegas for best-pal Doug’s bachelorhood week-end; only problem is, the bachelor’s gone. The toilet-humor flick is an end-less train of hijinks, including but not limited to finding a baby in a closet, a tiger in a bathroom and a tiny Asian man in the trunk.
With a score of R-rated antics, “The Hangover” has the makings of a frat 
classic. If all else fails, there’s a completely random cameo by Mike Tyson that’s sure to snag next year’s Best WTF Moment at the MTV Movie Awards.
— Amanda Martinek
Staff Writer“THE HANGOVER”
Ever since “My Big Fat Greek Wedding” went from box-office flop to DVD favorite, Nia Vardalos has 
been sucking the Greek teat dry . But for 
those of you who couldn’t get enough of the dizzying family antics and sexual tension that started it all, don’t be fooled: “My Life in Ruins” is not a sequel. Despite the car-bon-copy storyline — socially inept Greek woman seeks self-fulfillment , finds last-
chance romance with unlikely, ungainly suitor and lives happily ever after — Donald Petrie’s latest has ditched the innocent indie vibe that made the first flick so loveable. This time around, Vardalos stars as 
Georgia, an Athens tour guide who suffers a midlife crisis while leading an eccentric sightseeing group, eventually falling in love with her hot bus driver.  
Stuffed with unscrupulous boob jokes 
for your inner third-grader, the date film might be good for a few cheap cracks (dealt by ignorant tourists and middle-aged bitches), but it won’t outweigh its “Big Fat” predecessor in genuine humanity.

Quentin Tarantino is returning to the big screen with his self-proclaimed “ultimate masterpiece”: an epic tribute to spaghet-
ti Westerns, set against the chilling backdrop of World War II. Drenched in blood and dripping with Tarantino’s signature irreverence, “Inglourious Basterds” (it’s spelled that way on purpose) trails a group of Jewish soldiers who that sets out to exact revenge on the Nazis in occupied France. 
Brad Pitt assumes a starring role as Lt. Aldo 
Raine, a merciless antihero who engages his troops in swift retribution. Given the direc-tor’s previous efforts, the flick could realistically set new precedents for buckets of fake blood. Tarantino reportedly spent more than a decade writing the script, hoping  to achieve the same 
delightful balance of gore and humor bubbling from “Pulp Fiction. ” But whether or not the prolific mastermind manages to tap his mojo, his penchant for artsy flair and instant, macabre gratification is enough to make “Inglourious Basterds” worthy of a summer matinee.

Staff Writer“INGLOURIOUS
BASTERDS”“THE TAKING OF 
PELHAM 1 2 3”
One part “Speed” and two parts “Phone Booth, ” “The Taking of Pelham 123” will likely amount to 
106 New Y ork minutes of heart-thumping melodrama. Revamping the 1974 British adaptation of John Godey’s best-selling novel, Tony Scott hopes to retain the original’s slick cynicism while playing off modern-day terrorist fears.
John Travolta, complete with bad-ass 
handlebar mustache, plays a criminal genius who hijacks the city subway for a sizable ransom. The car’s dispatcher is none other than Denzel Washington (plucked by Scott for the second time since “Man on Fire”), who shines even in previews as hardworking blue-collar everyman Walter Garber. 
Tension rattling the rails, Garber must 
find a way to save his terrified hostages from gunfire — sure to make audiences thankful for San Diego’s shitty public trans-portation.

“We’re working with folks in the 
Development Office and trying to 
develop relationships with donors, ” Calfas said. “They identify people who might have an interest in estab-lishing a relationship with the uni-versity and with health and wellness issues. [We] meet with them and talk about the possibities of what we might be able to develop and how they can participate in that. ”
According to Calfas, services 
provided  the center could be fund-ed by either a student-fee referen-dum, current budgetary allocations, the implementation of a fee-for-ser-vice system or as part of the student health-insurance plan.
Currently, student registration 
fees provide approximately $5.7 mil-lion for services and programs in the wellness cluster.
Rue said that while the university 
waits to secure funding from indi-vidual private donors, the Student Affairs Office must now focus on planning for the center’s future.
“I would love to be optimistic 
and say we can get this going quick-ly, but people are already overbur-dened, ” Calfas said. “In one sense, this is when students need it the most, but on the other hand, I don’t want this to be a new burden for stu-dents as well. I know these bad eco-nomic times do go away. We’re not going to just stop our planning. We want to be ready to move forward when things improve and donations are a little more avilalable. ”
Calfas said the Student Wellness 
Center, in addition to providing room for old services to expand, will offer space for the development of new services based on student interest.
“We want to actually create new 
services for students and provide them in a more integrated way, ” Calfas said. “Once we have funding in place, I’m really confident that UCSD will be a leader in this area of student wellness and that we will have programs that are novel and cutting-edge. ”
Once complete, the four-story 
facility is expected to encompass 50,000 to 60,000 square feet of space north of Main Gymnasium near the Student Center. 
 “What we think is unique about 
the center is that the integration of services provides a more holistic, whole-person approach to health and well-being, ” Student Wellness Director Jerry Phelphs said. 
Phelps said he wants the Wellness 
Center to be a place where experts in all areas of health can find the appropriate resources to collaborate and refer students to the best set of available services.
Student Affairs is seeking feed-
back from students to determine which services most interest them. This has included the development of focus groups and consultations with student advisory boards. They have also monitored a group of students for two consecutive years to measure their knowledge and attitudes about health and to track

“We’re measuring different pro-
grams and health behaviors in gen-e r a l  t o  f i g u r e  o u t  w h e r e  t o  b e s t  direct our activity, ” Phelps said. “We’re trying to be cost effective. ” 
According to Phelps, the sur-
veyed students said they most value meditation classes, online tools designed to help students manage stress and recreation voucher pro-grams.
Associate Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Ed Spriggs said that  when the Wellness Center is con-structed and operating, it will still be overseen by Calfas and operated as part of the wellness cluster. 
“We have not yet determined 
what the Wellness Center’s actual operating budget will be, ” he said.

UCSD will also have a varsity four 
boat, consisting of senior co-captain Jonathan Lynch, sophomore Justin Hsu, sophomore Jonathan Seibert, senior Michael Sullivan and senior coxswain Vanessa Garret. 
“UCSD is really an up-and-coming program on the national level, ” Gordon said. “During this transformation pro-cess everybody on the team plays a role in molding what the program will look like in the following years. ” 
After an already successful sea-
son, the Tritons hope to make strides toward a bright future in UCSD row-ing this weekend.

competition could be a tall task.
“When students say they want 
a football team, they’re thinking Division-I USC vs. UCLA, ” Grosse said. “That just doesn’t seem real feasible. ”
While Grosse sees the leap to 
Division-I as more realistic, the move comes with a price. The Athletics Fee Referendum of 2007 increased athlet-ics fees from $95 to $329 per year. The larger budget was used to comply with a then-new Division-II mandate that requires all programs to offer $250,000 in scholarships.
NCAA ’s mandate for Division-I athletic scholarships is $964,700, which may require more money from students and donations from UCSD’s surrounding community.
Despite the freeze on applications, 
Gupta said the council should start planning now for a possible move. 
“We need to start our discussions 
now and take a proactive role in all of issues to see what it’s going to cost students, ” Gupta said. “We need to ensure that we’re protecting student interest. ”

The A.S. Council’s decision last 
week to keep the Grove Caffe open 
was voided when the A.S. Judicial 
Board ruled Tuesday that the ver-
dict was reached using incorrect 
procedure. 
Councilmembers voted against 
discontinuing Grove opera-
tions under the assumption that 
a two-thirds majority was neces-
sary to approve the legislation. A.S. 
President Donna Bean immediately 
contested that only a simple major-
ity should have been necessary.
Fifteen councilmembers v oted 
in favor of the legislation, while 11 
voted against it. A simple-majority 
voting system would have resulted in the  Grove’s closure.
The board reached its decision 
after revi ewing Robert’s Rules of 
Order Newly Revised, the coun cil’s 
prima ry document of parliamen-
tary conduct. According to Judicial 
Board Chair Stephen Juarez, the 
vote should have depended only 
on a simple majority. The board 
has fi ve days from its decision on 
Tuesday to release i ts of
ficial state-
ment on the matter.
Given the option of reconsi der-
ing the legislation at a meeting last 
night, councilmembers moved to 
table the revote until May 6 after a 
debate aro se over the finality of the 
Judicial Board’s decision.

After two ye ars of picking through details, the c ommit -
tee tasked wit h updating UCSD’s 28-year-old policy on 
“speech, advo cacy and distribution of li terature” has once 
again postponed its deadline for completion. 
The co mmittee first push ed the  relea se of its draf t from Ma y 1 
to seventh w eek, due to lingering disagreements about phrasing. 
Then, earlier t
his week, vice chancellors Steven W . Relyea and 
Penn y Rue ins tructed  commi ttee ch air and Associat e Controller 
Sally Brainerd to hold onto the policy until  fall 2009, when a 
public input  period will  finally c ommence. 
Brainerd said the  timeline  would have dangerously resem-
bled that of a similar scena rio in spring 2007. The speec h-policy  
commi ttee at the time , chaired by Spo rts Facil ities Manager Don 
Chadwick, released a controversial poli cy proposal during finals 
week. The changes were sent campuswide in an e-mail titled 
“Rev iew of PPM 51 0-1 Se ction IX. ”
It was met w
ith im medi ate u proar from stude nts and faculty 
who felt the admi nistration was trying to sneak the restrictions 
past public review. The Ameri can Civil L iberties Union argued in a  
letter t o the univ ersity that a whopping 10 aspects of  the policy wer e 
uncon stitutional, including a clause st
ating that a ny event or gathering 
that could “reasonably be expe cted to attract a  crow d of 10 or mo re 
peop le” w ould require a reservation.
Benjamin Balthaser, Gra duate S tudent  Ass ociation representa tive 
on th e current com mittee, was among those who participat ed in an 
emerge ncy rally outside former Vice Chancellor of Studen t Af
fairs 
Joseph W . Watson’s office. Second-year Joh n Vasquez dedicated www .
ucsdfr eespeech.com to keeping studen ts inform ed abo ut the policy.
According to Balthaser an d committee member and Director of 
Student Policies a nd Judicial Affairs Tony Val ladolid, ther
e has been 
speculation that th e controver sial restrictions drafted by the first 
commit tee wer e partly in respons e to ca mpus di sruptions at the time, 
including  antia borti on d emonstrations and protest s over changes in 
Thurgood Mars hall Col lege’s Dimensions of Culture cu rriculum.
Brainerd said the former speec h-policy commit tee was gi ven Accordin g to the c urren t draft
of the new speech polic y, 
the fol lowing zones would only 
permit electronic ally ampliﬁ  ed 
speech betwe en certai n times.  
Otherwi se, ele ctronic devices 
could be used in any area, as 
long as the the speaker is 150 
feet f rom an occupied building. 
No on-campu s express ion would 
be pe rmitted to exceed 90

Garret Berg is pretty sure A.S. 
Programming just redeemed itself. 
Less than a year after students 
slammed his office for orchestrating 
what many referred to as the death 
of the Sun God Festival, Berg — 
current associate vice president of 
programming — has secured a slew 
of musicians he said he feels certain 
will inject new life into the annual 
fest
ival.
Taking the main stage will be 
alternative hip-hop troupe N.E.R.D., 
followed by bearded folk-rocker 
Iron and Wine. Engineer turned 
sweaty dancehall hipster Girl Talk 
will headline the festival’s dance 
tent, a massive deejay-oriented 
enclosure to be located in the north-
east corner of RIMAC Field. 
The three top acts will be accom-
panied by Mo tion City Soundtrack, 
Sara Bareilles, Augustana, the Cool 
Kids, Grand Old Party, Rootbeer, DJ 
Nu-Mark of Jurassic 5, Anavan and 
Nosaj Thing. Also working the stage 
will be Battle of the Bands winner, 
the Theory of Funkativity. 
Cirque Berzerk — a contempo-
rary dance  group that re-
imagines 
traditional circus performances by 
incorporating elements of punk rock, risque burlesque and horror-
flick fantasy — will return this year 
for a full day of performances. Los 
Angeles-based comedians in the 
Upright Citizens Brigade are sched-
uled to perform throughout the day. 
Both attractions will be located on 
the midway, a canopied  stage to 
be located in the center of RIMAC 
Field. 
“We couldn’t be happier with the 
lineup right now, ” Berg said. “We 
have diversity, we have big name 
acts — we think we really have 
something for everyone. It should 
be pretty phenomenal.”
Working with a total festival 
budget of approximately $550,000, 
Berg’s office sought to secure  big-
name artists by booking fewer sec-ondary acts, pumping nearly one-
third of the Sun God budget — a 
move inspired by student criticism 
of last year’s lineup.
“What we heard from last year 
was ‘Enough of the small bands, we 
want that money spent on bigger 
acts,’” Berg said. “We r
eally listened 
to that feedback and got rid of some 
of those smaller acts and tried to re-
orient stuff to the bigger acts. ”
He said a great deal of atten-
tion went into securing acts that 
would appeal to a wider range of 
students than rapper Sean Kingston 
and rockers Coheed and C
ambria, 
who performed last year.
“If you put this side by side with Revised festival will 
facilitate re-entry to 
RIMAC with streamlined wristband distribution.

This week, as students cast 
their TritonLink ballots for next 
year’s A.S. Council, they will be 
using the Single Transferable 
Vote system, which allows vot-
ers  to rank A.S. executive and 
academic-division senator can-
didates in order of preference. 
Although STV was imple-
mented in 2007, this is the 
first A.S. election it will impact
 
because last year’s races were 
largely unopposed — and there 
are still a few kinks in the sys-
tem.
Under  STV , in the event that 
a student’s first-choice candi-
date receives the fewest votes, 
that vote will be transferred 
to the student’s second-choice 
candidate; and so
 on, until any 
one candidate achieves simple 
majority with 50 percent plus 
one vote. 
According to Associate Vice 
President of Athletic Relations 
Peter Benesch, the council 
switched to the STV system to 
encourage greater involvement 
in elections. Councilmembers 
felt students would be more inclined to vote for independent 
candidates if their votes would 
be transferred in the event of a 
loss, and that independent can-
didates would be more inclined 
to run for office if they felt stu-
dents wouldn’t be deterred from 
supporting them.
At UCSD, STV voting will 
only be used to determine races 
in which candidates compete 
for one position. All races other 
than those for the four execu-
tive offices and academic-divi-
sion senate seats will continue 
to be decided by the standard 
plurality system. Because candi-
dates in those races will be com-
peting for multiple spots — for 
instance, eight slots in the case 
of campuswide senator — the 
vote transfer becomes less clear. 
“It’s easier to abuse the 
system in these larger races, ” 
Benesch said. He cited cases 
of strategic lobbying at UC 
Berkeley, where candidates 
on larger slates campaign for 
specific rankings in o rder to 
manipulate a more favorable 
transfer of votes. According to A.S. elections 9(52,+=6;05.;6047(*;

The budget crisis spread to Price 
Center last Tuesday, when UCSD 
Bookstore and Perks Coffee Shop 
unveiled new business hours. Vice 
Chancellor of Business Affairs 
Steven Relyea attributed the changes 
to the nation’s current economic 
downturn. Previously, the bookstore’s hours 
were 8 a.m. to  8 p.m. Monday 
through Thursday, 8:00 a.m. to 6 
p.m. Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on 
Saturday and noon to 6  p.m. on 
Sunday. The hours have been changed to 8 
a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday 
and noon to 5 p.m. on weekends.
The coffee shop’s hours used to 
be 7 a.m. to  9 p.m. Monday through 
Friday, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Saturday 
and noon to 7 p.m. on Sunday. The 
hours have been changed to 8 a.m. 
to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, 
and noon to 5 p.m on Saturday and 
Sunday.Additionally, prices of products 
that have not sold well — main-
ly electronics and apparel — have 
continued to drop since a gener-
al downtrend in purchases began 
in N
ovember, UCSD Bookstore Director John Turk said. 
The bookstore has managed to 
break even by decreasing expen-
ditures at about the same 3.5 per-
cent rate at which sales have waned 
since November, and has avoided 
filling 12 career employee vacan-
cies — along with 15 student posi-
tion vacancies — in an attempt to 
cut costs. Though no employees have been 
laid off due to the cutback in hours,  
three cashiers have been moved to the 
bookstore-owned Sunshine Market, 
which has maint
ained normal hours.

Students participating in independent candidate Utsav Gupta’s presidential campaign prepare 
posters bearing the candidate’s slogans in Price Center Plaza on April 5. 
By Connie Shieh
Senior Staff Writer
Election week is finally here, 
and candidates are crossing their 
fingers after a month of fierce 
campaigning that included visits 
to student organizations, appeals 
to college councils and weeks of 
mingling with potential constitu-
ents in an effort to secure the 
student vote.
Perhaps the most anxious of 
these candidates are the three pres-
idential hopefuls: Erin Brodwin of 
Student Voice!, Adam Teitelbaum 
of the
 Clean Slate and independent candidate Utsav Gupta.
Addressing issues of college 
affordability, campus life and 
student involvement in coun-
cil affairs, Brodwin, Gupta and 
Teitelbaum sought to paint a pic-
ture of a more perfect student-
governing body.
Students can vote on 
TritonLink all this week. Polls 
close Friday,  April 10 at 4 p.m.

GRADUATING EDITORS FINALLY LEAVE PRODUCTION, BUT NOT WITHOUT SOME WISE WORDS AND A HEALTHY DOSE OF NOSTALGIA
Here  I am, settlin g into m y writ-
ing nook  besid e a sticker-cluttere d 
file cabinet  in the Guardian  office for 
the very last time. It’s hard to fight 
nostal gia.
I want to offer  you the perfect  
answer, the perfect  goodbye. All the 
hundreds of articles, the hours and hours  of rese
arch and interviews and 
A.S. Council m eetin gs, the some-
times tearful  fights over word choice  
and desig n edits, and the late nights 
that turne d to mornin gs — I want  
them to add up to somethin g, some 
insight, more meanin gful than  th eir 
parts.  But I fin d my pockets  empty. 
I lived the dream. How  stran ge to 
come to the end of somethin g so big 
and hard and wonderful.  
Note  that at this point  in edits, 
Simone’s  rolle d eyes are wider than a 
flax
en-haire d guid e puppy’s  as clutch-
es the paper  to her chest, red pen in hand, and in her most syrup-enchant-
ed voice announces,  “Wonderful , guys 
we’re  wonderful!”  to the production  
room. But that’s  the kind of tireless  
criticism (paire d with  unrivale d syn-
tactical  finesse  and desig n skill) the 
Guar
dian  needs. 
And so, as is tradition, to the shout  
outs.  
Most  of my time at UCSD has been  
spent  stretchin g to meet the perfection  
I saw in the Guardian ’s Golden Age. 
This  sendoff seems empty without  at 
least a nod to Gran t
’s sophisticated 
attention  to detail, I an’s indescribable  
knack  for everythin g cool and impor-
tant, Vlad’s fervor  for improve ment, 
Cody’s shut-up-an d-dance  style  and 
Marianne’s  bitin g wit. I also  owe big 
thanks  to Charles, who stretche d right along with  me and brou ght a bumpin’ 
play
list; Nathan,  who is a tremendous-
ly thou ghtful  editor and person;  and 
Mike,  who keeps this place runnin g 
year after  year.  
To Simone: I can’t  express  how 
prou d and excite d I am for you; you’re  
going to be the best editor this paper’s  
seen in
 quite  a while.  I mi ght have  a 
celebrity  crush.  Just keep  your  eye on 
the clock  next year — it  doesn’t m at-
ter how bomb the paper  is if no one 
gets to read it. 
To next year’s  editors:  I know  I 
don’t say it enou gh — or  ever — 
but you guys have hel
ped raise  the 
Guardian  to a new standard of qual-
ity and, if you work  for it, things will 
I write  long. That’s  why  it’s 
weir d that after  spen ding so many 
years  as a sports  writer for the 
Guardian  and discussin g topics  
from Kazaa m to Space Jam and 
everythin g in between  (thou gh 
mostly  just Kazaa m and Space Jam) 
I’m finding it hard to write  about  
myself and my time here. Inste
ad, 
I’ll just write  a long drawn-out  
thank  you that will satisfy  my own  
guilt-ridden need to let people  
know  that I appreciate  them. So 
thank  you to everyone  who  ever  
took  the time to read one of my 
colum ns, no matter ho w long, 
irrelevant or borin g. Thank  you to 
everyone  who  respon ded with  what  
they  liked, didn’t like or how  useful  
the Guardian  was durin g bowel  
movements. Thank  you to every-
one in the office who  kept  giving 
me space to ramble needlessly  and 
was good ab
out cuttin g out the 
crap, even  if some of the crap I 
foun d hilarious. Thank  you to all 
the editors,  sports  editors,  assis-
tant sports  editors,  etc. who  have  
given  me so much flexibility  to just 
write,  despite  how  crappy I think  
each and ever
yone  of my colum ns 
is. Thank  you to all of the UCSD  
athletes,  coaches and anyone  that 
ever  took  the time to answer a 
few questions while  I stoo d with  
a tape  record er actin g like I knew  
what  I was  doing. Thank  you to 
anyone  who  ever  sat there with  me 
whil
e I was  coming up with  ideas 
or writin g down  things that may 
or may not be funny or interest-
ing, gave me a funny suggestion  
or unfunny suggestion that I still  
used anyway.  Thank  you to the cit-
ies of Phila delphia,  Bakersfiel d and 
Tucson  for b
eing so shitty  and ripe 
for insult. Thanks to anyone  who  
came to a basketball  game or any 
sportin g event  to watch  with  me 
and keep  my company  and allow  
me to act like a big deal  in front  
of other  people  when  flashin g a 
press pass
. Most  of what  I write  in 
colum ns was purely  to entertain  
myself,  so if anyone  else ever  was 
an entertaine d bystan der, thank  
you for reading in the right place  
at the right time. Writin g about  
the UCSD m en’s basketball  team or 
any other UCSD spor t has always

To be cliche,  I’m going to start  off 
with  a word everyone’s  probably  tired 
of hearin g by now:  chan ge. Across  
the globe,  the future  is a big, fat ques-
tion mark — econo mically,  socially,  
personally  and I’m sure for some of 
you even  academically  — that  mani-
fests itself very differ ently for every-
one. For better  or for worse,  however,  
it is our oblig ation  as youn g citizens  
to make absolutely  sure that we do 
everythin g in our power  to facilitate  
these  chan ges in a positive  way when  
at all possible.  And that,  ladies and 
gentlem en, begins with  educatio n.
First  off, every  single one of you 
shoul d feel lucky  to be here:  a worl d-
class  university with  an outstan ding 
scholarly  reputation,  sunny beach-
side home, thrivin g social  life (gasp,  
did I just  defend UCSD?) and, admit-
tedly, enou gh organic chemistry  to 
make ev
en Chancellor Marye  Anne  
Fox cringe. But that’s  what  makes 
our campus so special;  we’re  smart, 
we’re  laid back  and we know  when  to be serious  (addin g that last crucial  
graph to our final  biolo gy lab report ) 
and when to have  a raging good time 
(f
lailin g uncontrollably under the 
dance  tent during Sun God).
Grante d, most of you worke d 
very hard to get where  you are, and 
I respect  that.  But soon  you’ll  be 
where  I am right at this very moment 
— about to leave , and ready for a 
steady nine-to-five,  top-notch  gradu-

a year before  deciding to make the 
next step. Regardless of your  plans,

— no matter  where  you came from 
— you are one of the priv

There are a lot of words out there 
that haunt me. Usually they are placed 
together so well by people so much better at writing than myself that I can’t help but cringe. Sometimes they haunt me even while I sleep on them, even under a bottle of whiskey. 
The Guardian is well stocked with 
the next generation of intimidating writers. Nevertheless, some of us are going to circle our draining industry — probably hung-over. 
As the typical drunk, misanthropic 
writer I aspire to be, I’m eager to circle that drain right into the shadow of greatness: Hemmingway, Faulkner — Tori Spelling. But it was the great Hunter S. 
Thompson that inspired me to the Guardian ’s door. He was a hell’s angel 
for a year, shot to the top ranks of Nixon’s enemies list and once dropped the still bloody heart of a four-point buck on Jack Nicolson’s doorstep to spice up a lonely night. It never got weird enough for him and I hope it never does for me.
It hasn’t gotten weird enough for 
Matt Taibi either, who got himself arrested in Russia to uncover corrup-tion, interviewed John Kerry while wearing a gorilla suit — on shrooms — and spent time as a young Republican to find out what makes the weirdest contradiction in politics tick. If only I can haunt as well as he does someday.
Literary inspiration aside, it was 
Hadley Mendoza who bantered me into actually applying to the paper and why I always smiled with genuine love through the fog of hate on production nights. Matt McArdle welcomed me to one of my first news meeting — and the quote wall — with a comedy room come-on, and he’s been lobbing them 
I submitted one of my first news 
articles to my editor more than three years ago, and was silently and shamefully humiliated when my brutally edited article was published in the paper. I honestly thought it was clever, but instead, I imagined that the six hours I spent writing the story only led to behind-my-back snickering.
And it was my fault. Not for 
being stupid, but for being big-headed enough to think I couldn’t have an ounce of stupidity in me. I didn’t read the Guardian , or news 
in general, as much as I should have — I couldn’t even make it to cam-pus for class — and therefore wasn’t completely familiar with the writing style. I rarely went to meetings, bare-ly knew any of the staff members and the Cityshuttle article was the third one I’ d written in a six-month period. 
Y es, it was a shitty article because 
I was shitty journalist. And in a bold move, I applied for the associate news editor position after it was published.  
Landing the job forced me to do things I wouldn’t have done other-wise. Like writing more than three articles every six months, attending meetings twice a week and partici-pating in Guardian events like Vegas 
and karaoke — all of which resulted in my journalism professor, and for-mer Los Angeles Times  writer, telling 
me last month that I had “mastered” the basic news writing style. 
So thank you Alyssa for prying 
me off the bed at 9 a.m. Vegas time, semi-drunk and slightly functional, to do a phone interview for an article due the next day, because improve-ment starts with forcing yourself to do things you don’t want to do. 
And that’s one of the most valu-
able things I’ve learned from work-ing at the Guardian . I never craved 
writing all those Cityshuttle and parking articles. But it taught me how to be an investigative reporter, and it made me a more seasoned writer. 
From frat hazing to state budgets, 
the Guardian  h a s  t a u g h t  m e  a l l  t h e  
perks of being a journalist — aside from hate mail through Facebook from Pi Kappa Alpha brother Alan Roof — and how those perks will help me after graduation. 
Journalists get information faster 
than most people. It’s our job to find the answer to any question. Journalists are also quick studies, constantly learning new subjects — such as policies and what an elephant walk is — then turning around and teaching those things to the public. And since we follow stories, not nine-to-five schedules, journalists have a great work ethic. We drop everything for breaking news. 
These traits are rooted in all the 
Guardian staffers. My time at the 
paper would have been completely unfulfilling had you all been fat, fobby, born-again Christians who refused alcohol or Bob.
To Matt: I have a confession. 
When I first saw you I thought, “Damn, that white boy’s kinda hot. ” And that’s saying a lot for a former darkie-lover. 
To Reza: I’ll never forget your 
thizz face, tulip joint or knife throw-ing. Damn Persian politician. 
To Jesse: the best gladiator-san-
dal and tie-dyed-shirt clad, Spanish-speaking hippie I know.
To Alyssa: Vegas baby. Y ou and 
me. 
To Y elena: Good luck next year as 
news editor, and on incorporating a pun into a news lead.
To Hadley: I don’t know what 
everyone else is talking about because you’ve never been a bitch to me.
To Simone: Thanks for always 
improving my articles. I know you’ll be an amazing editor in chief.
To Dave: Don’t forget to visit 
Pattaya Beach when you’re in Thailand. Remember, sawatikaa 
means “hello, ” kop kun kaa  means 
“thank you” and beware of the hot trannies. 
To the rest of the Guardian  staff: 
live it, love it, work it.

how awesome these sports are to as 
many people as possible. Even if just one person who did or didn’t attend the game read a recap and thought about going to the next game, that’s enough for me. My time as a student at UCSD and with the Guardian  has 
allowed me to meet everyone from Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to Kobe Bryant and Adam Morrison (truly the Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton of the NBA). I’m not sure what comes next, but whatever it is I will face it with the same wild-eyed confusion and Southern California-induced composure that has gotten me this far. And sorry to everyone who’s thank you got cut, cause I’m sure this went long too.
Last Winter Quarter I timidly 
stumbled into the Guardian  offices 
in the Student Center to attend an informational meeting promising free pizza. I didn’t know what to expect — especially since I was the only interested student to show up. As I stared at the roundtable of editors and senior staffers, I nearly lost my nerve. I went back for an interview later at my roommate Sarah’s urging. It will be worth it, she said, especially if I was serious about writing.
I’ve had the pleasure of writing for 
the Focus section, as well as serving as the section’s associate editor.  During my time at Focus, I’ve met and inter-viewed some amazing people. From a Chilean activist forced to flee her homeland after nearly being executed for her ideals to a group of pre-med students ditching the beach over sum-mer break to bring much-needed medical supplies to small Nicaraguan villages, the Guardian  has been a won-
derful platform from which to tell stories that mattered.
There is also no better place to 
be if you want to learn the random, interesting, and controversial minutia about campus and the research that goes on here — like the significance of bioluminescent worms, how the UCSD film department actually works and the true identity of the guy who rides his bike blasting Alicia Keys while blowing bubbles around cam-pus. As a reporter, I became vested in this campus and will not leave as clue-less as I entered.
The Guardian  a l s o  t a u g h t  m e  a  
thing or two about being a true San Diegan. Even though I’m a San Diego native, Site Seen assignments revealed to me a side of San Diego I would have never seen otherwise. Are you so angry that you need to pay to smash shit (Sarah’s Smash Shack)? I’ve done it. Want to see the ultimate in drag dining (Lips)? I’ve seen it. In the mood for drunken Korean karaoke (Min Sok Chon)? I’ve done it.
It’s been whirlwind experience 
filled with late nights and frequent Burger King soft-serve runs that Stephanie and Dave (my fellow page editors) and I didn’t think we’ d sur-vive. Now that we have, I want to wish Edwin and Aprille the best of luck with Focus next year.
Matt, Alyssa and Serena, thanks 
for welcoming an awkward, shy writer like me. Dave, Stephanie, and Emily — the Focus gang — I’ll miss our in-depth conversations on sTORI Telling  
by Tori Spelling. 
So, was it all worth it? Hell yes.
 It was a dark and stormy night. The 
lights in the Guardian  offices flickered 
on with a merciful power surge as edi-tors clacked blindly on their keys, count-ing the hours past deadline, crossing and re-crossing red lines on bloody first pages. Lady Gaga and Milkman took to the speakers, technofuzz dampening on contact as a high-hat tapped at the brass one-two-three-four, a delicious quarter-beat. And in the midst of the fog, the copy editor read and reread the last line, wondering what the fuck did that mean and then censored all unnecessary com-mas, shooting down dashes with pitiless punches at Delete.
Just kidding. Ridiculousness aside, 
I loved my job(s) at the Guardian . No 
matter how many dark and stormy nights, being copy editor was great. Being associate hiatus editor was awe-some. Who wouldn’t love poring over AP Stylebook 2007 — props to those intensely subtle, brilliant writers — or rewriting reviews on indiefucking bands I’ d never heard of before? It was a learn-ing experience to the Nth degree, and I embraced it with open arms.
So the dirty lies in that sentence

IT’S OUR WAY OF SAYING WE’RE PROUD OF YOU.
It’s June again, and that means yet 
another year has come and gone for 
me at UCSD. Another year of con-struction and classes, endless library hours, crammed schedules, loom-ing deadlines and three quarter-long sprints for “who can set the curve. ” In years past, as the weather warmed and the school year wound down to a close, my mind would wander ahead to the glorious days of summer. I would dream of a time when I’ d be free from the confines of a rigorous schedule and the stress caused by liv-ing in a community of concrete and bureaucracy. Every year until now, I’ve looked forward to months six through nine as a time to recharge my batteries, reconnect with friends and to expand personal interests and hob-bies. However, this year is different. This year, I graduate. As the day to walk crawls ever closer, I find myself in a more pensive mood than usual. This year, instead of trying to rush into summer sloth, I am reflecting on the time I’ve spent here and looking ahead with measured caution. 
So much has changed during my 
tenure at UCSD that it’s hard for me to even know where to begin. I will spare you all the “When I was a freshman, Sixth College didn’t even exist” speech. I will leave the “as we move forward” cliches about taking the next step in life to the graduation speakers. Those things have all been said before, in the pages of this very paper, by people who are much better writers than I’ll ever be. Instead, I would like to use my word count to thank all the people who have helped me reach this milestone.
First and foremost, to my family: 
Thank you, a million times over. Y ou have supplied me with a bottomless well of support and understanding, and for that I will be ever grateful. I am quite stubborn and have always insisted on doing things my way, on my terms, in my own time — and you’ve always had my back, unques-tionably, since day one. To my parents especially: Y our love and patience is something that I won’t truly under-stand until I have a child of my own. Y ou have set the standard high and I’m doing my best to keep it that way.
To all the engineers I befriended 
during my time here, and especially to the S&E crew: Thank you. Without you guys to share in the glory that is an all-night fluid mechanics homework session, or experience the frustration of a design project that just never works out the way it’s supposed to, I would have most likely gone insane. I have met some truly intelligent and driven people that I am honored to call my friends.
A big thank you goes out to all 
bosses, managers and co-workers that I have worked with during my time here on campus. A special thanks is reserved for Bob and Jimmy, who not only gave me a chance, but put up with my schedule and even recommended me for a job at the Guardian .
And finally, to the Guardian  itself: 
NETWORK ADMINISTRATOR
Unlike most of the staff, I never 
walked a beat or spent a late night in the production room. I never waged battle against the  Koala  in sloshball 
or spent a President’s Day weekend in Vegas attempting to eat my way through the Bellagio buffet. In fact, this is the first and last article that I have written for the Guardian . 
There’s a fairly good reason why; it takes me ages to write a single article, and along the way there are long bouts of writer’s block and false starts. In fact, this article you’re reading is version three or four of my many partial rough drafts. My inability to pump out articles at a moment’s notice also explains why I have spent my four years at the  
Guardian  as an advertising designer 
instead of a writer. 
Working at the Guardian  kept 
me fairly close to the eye of the storm and showed me that UCSD was not entirely devoid of activity as I had been led to believe when I first arrived. My hiring came at the same time a scandal broke at SRTV over porn being aired on a student-run television channel. For

MGSM.Alliant.edu/Bright-Green-MBA/are “open arms” and “embraced. ” I 
did neither at first; I actually took on copy reading because I was a desperate freshman in need of a job. And when I started writing for Hiatus, my words were all wrong. “Good” and “Bad” don’t exist on the page, and I was shov-ing them in left and right. But what did I know? All I had to back me up was a couple years of high school newspaper; a few Quill and Scroll badges. I still had the Spice Girls on my iPod. (And now, I still do.)
But after two years of fierce battle, 
I clutched my prize: better writing and more patience than ever before. It sounds cliche, but all those metaphors meant something to me. Every time I heard music scrape or sigh or orgasm, 
it excited me. Reviewing music means you look a little closer than everyone else, and you break down why it should matter to the world. In copy editing, it’s the same: clarity and vivacious-ness trumps murkiness and placid-ity. Boring doesn’t click. Write what excites you, and guaranteed, you’ll excite someone else.
Next year, I’m filling my proverbial 
grab bag with these life lessons, and trooping on down to the UCLA School and Theatre, Film and Television. Maybe a newsroom will show up in my first short film. Or maybe, any of you will.

Justin Williams convinced me to 
write from Egypt while I was abroad — wasn’t that a great idea — and Sonia made me never want to leave my office unless it was with her. Simone, I can’t thank you enough for your snarky criticism, I am much better for it. Please read that in your mocking voice, it’s better than the cutsie one.
Alyssa, thanks for teaching me not 
to mock God-people. Oops. Some things never change.
Joanna and Stephanie, I can’t even 
begin. I could go on, but won’t, because I hate shout outs.
Now that I’m at the bottom of the 
bottle, I am really looking forward to the road and I know I will look back at the Guardian  and remember that I 
didn’t learn in class, but on the job. I had some amazing times, and surprisingly enough, I remember most of them. 
I couldn’t have asked for a better 
place to start my repertoire; I’ve pub-lished ridiculousness in my “Dave in Cairo” column, boasted a sick stench of Wild Turkey while working and driven off with a Koala  girl’s car during 
a production night beer run. 
But I’m looking to branch out, and 
there’s really two places I can end up: on those pages you can’t stop turning or that dumpster over by Muir. Hell, maybe I’ll get lucky and have both. Either way it’s going to be a fucking hazy adventure.

▶ HARVEY, MYVTWHNLthose who missed it, the story hit national news, and SRTV was sub-sequently shut down, in a series of rather chaotic events. Other stories followed — wildfires, the opening of Price Center East, the annual debate over the Grove Caffe, and of course the annual push to raise student fees through one means or another. I leave UCSD with the story of a bird dive-bombing students in Price Center. 
The Guardian  is unequivocally 
the best place to work on campus. Where else does one get to debate the grammatically correct past tense of “ghostriding the whip?” Or walking in on a Wednesday afternoon to see an editor emphatically singing Celine Dion while on his knees. I will always remember crashing classes on Sun God, laughing at the crazy letters to the editor that manage to find their way to us (one in particular claimed Scarlett Johansson was a cloned human), and laughing at the market-ing staff comparing their cute friends on Facebook. Oh, and occasionally we put out a newspaper issue or two.
A few words of thanks before I leave. First, thanks to the busi-ness staff, the two Mikes (now down to one), James the free agent, Superman Alfredo and the busi-ness manager position that turned over like a professorship in Defense against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts, set straight by Anna and currently headed by Monica. Thanks also to all the other advertising designers who have joined me at some point the  
Guardian , including Laura, Jennifer, 
Nick, Kim, Brandon and Jenny, you guys are awesome. And finally thanks to all four years’ worth of Guardian  
staff, lead by Grant, Heather, Charles and Matt, for keeping the Guardian  a 
fun place to work.
As I pondered over how to end 
this, I realized that I am severely underqualified to leave words of wis-dom for people to read, but I will just say that college isn’t about locking yourself in your room and studying 24/7, nor is it about partying it up every night until your liver takes you to court for abuse and neglect. College is about finding the happy medium between the two, and sur-viving to tell the tale.

▶ CHEN, MYVTWHNL
Thank you. Thank you for accept-ing me in your warm embrace, as if this was always my home and I just never knew it. Coming into the office was always an exciting experience to say the least, so thank you to all the personalities that made my two years on staff the most colorful I’ve experi-enced on this campus. 
Finally, I’ d like to leave all of you 
continuing on at UCSD with a bit of advice, one of the most important things I learned while here: UCSD is as fun as you make it. When I first attended this campus as a freshman, I absolutely hated it. My classes were huge, the campus was outrageously large and everybody seemed addicted to their cell phones, cramming their faces into the dim screens of their next digital fix the moment class was dis-missed. My perception of this campus was that of a cold, sterile place where thousands of nerds gathered in stag-nant silence. This was not my idea of how college was supposed to be — this place sucked. 
Well, the classes are even bigger 
now, the campus is ever stretching, and we students no longer wait for the end of class to text. So why do I have fond memories of this place at all? The short answer is that I changed. I found that, instead of pointing the finger and complaining, doing something about it actually made a difference.
If you are tired of this place being 
boring, bring the flavor. If one day a year isn’t enough to cut loose, wear that crazy Sun God outfit and get drunk at the pub before class during week three of Fall Quarter. No excus-es! Y ou aren’t going to be 20-some-thing and in college forever. We might be some of the brightest California has to offer, but we are too often locked in our own lane, blinders on, during our quarterly sprint to a letter grade. Free your mind, and your ass will follow!

▶ NEILL, MYVTWHNLrefused to prioritize higher education time and time again. Schwarzenegger even wants to eliminate the Cal Grant program (can anyone say horrible, horrible idea?), in effect telling stu-dents to simply borrow more (borrow-ing sure worked great for our econo-my, awesome advice) to finance their educations. Y es, higher education has huge obstacles ahead. But obstacles are meant to be overcome.
Could you think of your life with-
out college? Sure. Would you want to? Hopefully not. So I ask you to please consider these final words: Whatever you do in the future, don’t forget your time at UCSD, and work hard (everyone has something to lend) to make sure higher education doesn’t become unat-tainable for others. That way, another wide-eyed undergrad will be able to live, learn and laugh in your dorm in 10 years, and the cycle will continue.
OK, I’m done proselytizing. Now 
I must bid farewell to this home away from home, the campus newspaper offices. It is here that I found my place at UCSD, and somehow I made it to the top spot, sacrificing my social life and tanking more than a few classes along the way. But it was worth it. For every 4 a.m. night I had — scanning PDFs, making last-minute edits and re-re-writing headlines — seeing just one person reading the Guardian  the next 
day reminded me why I did this for five years. I have met and worked alongside incredible people during my time here, and it will be strange to think I no lon-ger need to sacrifice every Wednesday and Sunday to the production Gods. But, alas, it’s time to go.
To Simone: I don’t have the right 
words to describe how smart, genuine and talented you are, but I know you’ll do the paper right. To everyone else on staff (past, present and future): I couldn’t have done it without you. Thank you all so much for everything — it’s been a pleasure.

only get better next year. My advice to you is twofold. First, know that complacency is the enemy of progress. Second, don’t be too quick to discount anyone — Simone was nearly fired for designing too slowly and I was rejected from every section, including distribu-tion, before I finally harassed the copy editors into giving me a job. Y ou never know who’s going to surprise you. 
To General Store Co-op mem-bers and everyone else at the Student Center: There is more humor, passion and delicious food in this small, filthy-floored corner of campus than in the whole rest of UCSD. Y ou defined my college experience. Thanks for making it a good one.

that though he was unfamiliar with 
the details of Born’s case, he thought Warren College Residential Life offi-cials’ handling of the case — as opposed to the contract language — could be the source of the com-plaints.
“It may very well not be a result 
of a flawed policy, ” he said. “The policy could have been implement-ed in a flawed way. ”
Valladolid said that if Born’s 
proof of innocence was conclusive, some form of restoration for his punishment may be suitable.
“If he was found not in viola-
tion of the housing contract, then it seems to me that it would be appropriate for there to be some restorative justice in this sense, ” Valladolid said. “There should be some attempt to ameliorate the con-sequences. ”
Valladolid added that the uni-
versity’s current eviction procedures allow for certain checks on adminis-trative decisions.
“There is review built into that 
process, ” he said. “There is review up to the provost. Each of them can look at the totality of the circum-stances and weigh in on whether or not the decision is a fair one, if it followed appropriate due process and if there wasn’t something that was overlooked. … It is not entirely the resident dean and no one else t h a t  h a s  a n  o p p o r t u n i t y  t o  l o o k  a t  this. ”
However, Valladolid said that a 
situation such as Born’s — in which the case review took place several weeks after he had been evicted from his campus residence — may be unavoidable given the time con-straints surrounding this process.
“That’s unfortunately just 
because there are specific require-ments as to timing, ” he said. “To set up a meeting, to go in, to talk about it — in that interim, lots of things happen, including a student leaving campus upon being evicted. ”
Chou’s violations were not removed from her record after her own judicial board 
hearing on April 30, despite the fact that her drug test proved she did not use any illicit substances on the evening that Roake confronted her and Born. The board ruled that she should be held responsible for the actions of her roommate’s guest. 
“My roommate’s coworker 
smoked weed, ” Chou said. “I didn’t know anything about what was going on and I’m being held respon-sible for it. I don’t think that’s fair. … Do I have to set up surveillance cameras to make sure nothing out of the ordinary is happening while I’m not there?”
Chou is now appealing her case 
before Warren College Provost Steven Adler. 
Former campuswide senator 
Chris Westling, who serves as the A.S. representative to the campus housing and dining committee, said the clause could be altered if the changes were agreed upon by the  other committee members and Director of Housing and Dining Services Mark Cunningham. 
“From my understanding, 
this clause in the contract gives the administration a tremendous amount of power, ” Westling said. “We need to scrutinize not only this clause, but others that give a dispro-portional amount of power to one entity on campus. ”
Severson said the UC General 
Counsel’s office would also have to approve any changes to the contract. 
All representatives from the 
Warren College residential life office and the Warren College administra-tion declined to comment for this article.

I feel like I’ve learned so much since 
I’ve been here. ”
Rainwater said that women’s head 
coach Darcy Ahner, a former hep-tathlete from the University of New Mexico, has been very influential during her time at UCSD.
“She knows exactly what I’m 
going through, ” Rainwater said. “She has a lot of insight, not only on the physical and technical work, but also on the mental aspect of keeping your head in the game for 48 hours. ” 
Danielle Thu
While setting personal goals may 
seem critical for some athletes, junior 
hammer thrower Danielle Thu likes to keep an open mind and see where her throws take her.
“I tend not to set goals for myself, 
because I feel it limits my abilities, ” Thu said. “I don’t want to say I want to throw 190 [feet], then that’s my accomplishment for the year so I won’t try any harder. ” 
The Earl Warren College junior 
had an exceptional season, set-ting the school record in the hammer throw and besting that mark twice. Her season culmi-nated in San Angelo, Texas, with the NCAA Division-II National Championships. Thu didn’t just win, she blew dust at the competition on her way to becoming UCSD’s first national champion in the event. Thu’s mark of 198’8” won the event by nearly 14 feet and surpassed her own school record by nine feet. It was the fifth highest ever recorded in Division-II history. 
Thu started throwing shot put 
and discus in elementary school, and began hammer throw just before high school. Though hammer throw is very seldom held in high school competitions, she was introduced to the event at a UCLA track and field camp. Thu excelled at the event and was eventually recruited to UCSD’s team. 
Her successful season comes 
after years of weight training and technique practice, but Thu cites her desire to succeed as her great-est asset. 
“I really compete against myself, ” 
Thu said. “I always try to push myself to do better, and that’s what I really care about. ”

are left to live vicariously through the team we worship.
People in California are spoiled 
sports fans. The San Francisco 49ers, then-Anaheim Angels and Los Angeles Lakers have all been crowned champions in the past 15 years, giv-ing us unlimited taunting rights. 
However, in my collegiate years 
(which have been lengthy, as I attempt to become the longest tenured politi-cal science major and Guardian 
sports writer in history), I have been unable to watch a California profes-sional sports team win it all (sorry Los Angelinos, the University of Southern California is not a professional team — even if some of its players get paid).
I have never seen 
a championship cel-ebration engulf the UCSD campus, setting off what I can only assume would resemble a hybrid of Welcome Week and the Sun God Festival. I watched Red Sox fans celebrate the end of their drought in 2004 with reserved jealousy, but the creases still left in their brand new jerseys showed that you can’t really have a Boston celebration in San Diego.
I yearn for a celebration before 
I leave this campus. Y es, I admit to being a spoiled sports fan, and I know there are many fans of many teams who have waited far, far lon-ger. Honestly, if I never take part in another championship celebration, the feeling after the Angels won the World Series in 2002 will suffice for the rest of my life. Still, when you feel such an undying love for sports, it’s natural to always want more. It’s why we watch. It’s why we care.The Lakers almost gave us a rea-
son to celebrate last season, and most people tricked themselves into think-ing the Lakers would beat the Boston Celtics. We watched. We cared. They lost.
This year, the Lakers have been 
a better team than the Orlando Magic. They have Kobe Bryant, the best player in the series. Their edge is experience, particularly because much of the same team played in the NBA Finals last season. The triangle offense provides a much more stable 
structure on both sides of the ball — if used properly — than anything the Magic can put together. With a solid rotation, foundation and determination, the Lakers have all the pieces they need for a champion-ship.
Unfortunately, the Magic have a 
few things going for them. They have better team chemistry, are far deeper, can stretch the floor, swept the Lakers in the regular season and, most importantly, have been better battle-tested on their way to the finals. Orlando has defeated two of the best four teams in the league already, and the East has shown this season that it can provide playoff battles with the likes of LeBron James and Dwayne Wade. The up-and-coming Bulls, Hawks and Sixers may give rise to epic conference playoff battles for years to come.
My head tells me the Lakers are 
doomed to repeat failure in the final stage. But with the school year com-ing to a close, my heart tells me it’s about time for that just-finished-your-final kind of feeling.
Joe goes with: Lakers in seven.

MEN’S CREW  — It has been a record-
breaking year for the Tritons. UCSD 
trained since the fall with an ulti-mate goal in mind: qualify for the prestigious Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championships, the national championship equivalent for rowing. Now, after a second-place finish at the Western Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championships, that dream becomes a reality as the Tritons make their first-ever appear-ance at the IRAs from June 4 to June 7 at Lake Natoma in Sacramento. 
“It is a great honor for all of us to be a part of something so special, ” sopho-more Justin Gordon said of the IRA Championships. “Not only do we get to compete against the best collegiate crews in America, but we’re now part 
of UCSD crew history. ”
In April’s San Diego Crew Classic, 
UCSD was labeled the underdog. 
Although they were seeded lower than teams they had  beaten earlier in the season, the Tritons  immediately squashed preconceptions by taking top honors. The varsity eight squad’s first-place finish earned it a spot in next year’s Copley Cup and asserted UCSD as one of the premier units in collegiate rowing. Their top-25 ranking from the U.S. Rowing Collegiate National Polls all season long positioned the Tritons among rowing’s national elite.
At the Western Intercollegiate 
Rowing Association Championships earlier in May, UCSD finished third despite only entering five boats. Gonzaga University haunts the Tritons, inching ahead of UCSD in several races. In the Grand Final, the varsity eight boat snatched a silver medal for their second-place photo finish.
“Going into [that race] we knew 
Gonzaga was going to be fast, ” Gordon said. “It had been more than a month since we had seen them, so we really didn’t know what sorts of strides they had taken in the interim. We now know how fast they are and what we have to shoot for — one second over the course of six minutes. The IRAs are an opportunity for us to take our fastest boat and see how it directly stacks up against well-established row-ing powerhouses. Knowing that how we train will be directly correlated with our national standing is all the motiva-tion we need to push ourselves harder everyday on and off the water. ”Rowing is the oldest intercollegiate 
sport in the United States, and the East Coast Ivies have a well rooted rapport with the pastime. This year however, the West Coast will be hosting the 107th IRA Championships.
UCSD’s varsity eight squad will 
consist of senior co-captain Ryan Andre, junior Karam Badran, senior Jeff Collett, sophomore Kris Grey, junior Andrew Hilton, junior Jay Dee Morgan, sophomore Michael Verdone (moving up from the second varsity eight boat), junior coxswain Cameran Biltucci and Gordon.

Finishing its most successful sea-
son in school history, the wom-
en’s track and field team placed 
third at nationals May 23. Junior ham-mer thrower Danielle Thu and junior heptathlete Linda Rainwater high-lighted the meet, winning two of the Tritons’ three gold medals.
Linda Rainwater 
Since making the move to Division 
II in 2000, the track and field team has 
won five individual national champi-onships — with Rainwater earning two in as many seasons.
One of the team’s strongest athletes, 
Rainwater won the heptathlon in 2008 and the high jump in 2009. After plac-ing third in this year’s heptathlon, she took home the high jump title with a school record mark of 5’9.75” . But the event was not without drama. 
Competitors are given three chanc-
es to clear each bar height, and their 
number of attempts determines tie-
breaks. Rainwater missed her first two attempts at 5’5” — putting her at a disadvantage — but cleared the next three heights on her first attempt, win-ning the title. 
“ After not winning the heptathlon 
I was really motivated to win high jump, ” she said. “I wanted to win that event to keep a title, so it was really just 
pure competitiveness. ”  
Her third-place finish in the 2009 
heptathlon was by no means a disap-
pointment, despite losing her repeat bid. Her score of 5,303 points was nearly 300 points better than her win-ning score from last year and sur-passed the school record she set earlier this season.
Rainwater began her track and field 
career in fourth grade as a member of the Santa Barbara Y outh Track Club. She competed in several events, par-
ticipating in her first pentathlon in 
eighth grade. In high school, Rainwater excelled in the high jump and 100-meter hurdles but competed in many heptathlons as a member of the club. She only began to train specifically for the event after coming to UCSD.
“Practices [for heptathalons] are 
really long, ” she said. “We’ll have jumps, then throws, then running 
and sometimes weightlifting too. But :W_QVO;MI[WV+]TUQVI\M[I\-TQ\M1:)+PIUXQWV[PQX[

Take a quick look at the University 
of California athletics programs and 
UCSD sticks out like a sore thumb. It’s not our lack of a football team that sets us apart — only three UCs currently offer the sport. What separates UCSD is that — with the exception of UC Merced, which does not feature inter-collegiate athletics — the Tritons are the only remaining team still compet-ing in Division II.
UCSD didn’t make its move to 
Division II until 2000 and even then the school’s size and prestige hindered the Tritons’ ability to schedule match-es against smaller colleges with less resources.
Less than a decade later, the same 
scenario is repeating itself — this time at the Division-II level. Currently, most of UCSD’s teams compete as the only non-CSU members of the California Collegiate Athletic Association.
“In the CCAA, we’re the lone wolf 
as the only UC and are regularly out-voted by the state schools who have similar interests, ” Senior Associate Athletic Director Ken Grosse said. 
Because of minor disputes in 
scheduling of matches and the desire to compete against like institutions, the Athletics Department is seriously con-sidering moving up a division despite the current four-year moratorium on Division-I applicants.
“We’re always looking at possibilities 
and thinking about what to do if our current situation changes, ” Grosse said. “[Athletic Director Earl Edwards] has talked to the Big West and other confer-ences so we’re prepared. ”
The Big West, the Tritons’ most 
likely D-I destination, is comprised of all-former CCAA teams with the excep-tion of UC Irvine. 
A.S. President Utsav Gupta plans to 
put the D-I debate on the council’s all-campus student interest poll this fall. 
A similar poll was included with 
this spring’s A.S. election ballot, prob-ing students about their interest in an intercollegiate UCSD football team. Of the 24 percent of undergraduates who voted, 70 percent expressed support for a team, willing to pay an average of about $19 per quarter. 
“The students have shown their 
support, ” Gupta said. “Now it’s on the A.S. council to react. ” 
Because of Title IX — a law requir-
ing schools to match the number of men’s roster spots with women’s roster spots — a new football team would require cutting about 80 total male Tritons from various squads. Currently, neither the Big West nor the CCAA offer football programs, so finding Walking out of a final, most people are overcome by a certain feeling. No matter 
what happened in the previous 10 weeks and no matter how well you may or may not have done in the class, it’s over. If you walk out of that final feeling like somehow you were able to snag a good grade, that feeling is amplified. And if you’re that ques-tion kid walking out of a final, you start crying a little because you have so many more questions to ask. But nobody likes that kid. So screw you, question kid.
For everyone else, the feeling 
that it’s all done is comparable to one thing in sports: when your team wins a championship. Some people feel this sensation often — attaching themselves to whatever new team catches fire. These people are called bandwagoners and are also the only group deserving as much concen-trated hatred as question kids and gingers. However, to follow a team for a long time and then, one day, be rewarded — there’s nothing quite like it. Well, being a part of that team probably comes close, but most of us lack the amazing athletic ability and
