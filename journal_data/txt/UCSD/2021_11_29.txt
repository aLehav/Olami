UC-AFT Strike Called Off Hours Before Picket Line 
Commences as Faculty and UCOP Reach a Tentative 
Labor Agreement
By JOCELYN BROSSIA  Associate News Editor
Early in the morning of Wednesday, Nov. 
17, UC-AFT faculty received the news that 
their planned two-day strike was canceled 
due to the tentative labor agreement reached by 
the union president, Mia McIver, and the UC Of -
fice of the President following 2.5 years of stag -
nant bargaining.    
In the face of high job insecurity, insufficient 
pay, and allegedly confusing contracts, the UC-
AFT has been attempting to get the UCOP to reach a new labor agreement since April 2019. The union had advocated for an agreement that would provide clearer guidelines for the Universi -
ty’s reappointment processes, increase salary and benefits, and create a uniform workload, among other things.   
A number of UC San Diego lecturers previous -
ly expressed to The UCSD Guardian their feelings that the University viewed them as expendable, economic tools who would be extracted for labor only to soon be churned out of the system in favor of younger, more robust Ph.D. graduates. In the years of recent bargaining, the UCOP proposed solutions in contract negotiations that UC-AFT faculty would not accept due to significant cave -
ats they saw — which included the potential for disqualification from the proposed strengthened reappointment process.
Because UC-AFT felt their insufficient con -
tract negotiations had reached a stalemate, the union passed a 96 % majority vote in June 2021 to collectively strike at any given moment. 
The historic agreement that came early on 
in the morning of the planned strike meets the aforementioned concerns of the faculty and, if ratified, could significantly diminish the precar -
ity of a lecturer’s employment with the University. 
Contract clauses included in the tentative 
agreement as outlined on the UC-AFT website are as follows: 
• Transition plan to 2022-23 appoint -
ments
• Increased job stability
• Outlined pathway to senior continuing lecturer
• Statement of interest for available courses 
• Specific and transparent performance review criteria • Defined workloads 
• Increased compensations and bonuses
• Timely and more specific appointment 
letters 
• Credit toward continuing for summer 
session teaching 
• Expanded eligibility for paid medical leave 
• Increased support for unit members with children, 
• Expanded retirement and health ben -
efits for Summer Session lecturers
• Stronger health and safety provisions 
• Professional development funding 
• Release time for stewards 
• Online instruction protections
If ratified, the agreement’s job stability provi -
sions will go into effect on   J uly 1, 2022.
Dr. Brie Iatarola, a lecturer from the Commu -
nications, Environmental Studies, and Warren College Writing Program Departments, felt relief upon reading the email she received at 4:30 a.m. that morning that announced the agreement. 
“I was relieved when I heard the news of the 
agreement,” Iatarola said. “I am optimistic about the future for UC lecturers. I also feel I must re -
main vigilant and proactive due to potential chal -
lenges of implementing these changes across the UC system.”
Iatarola believes that much of the external 
pressure and the planned strike were what led to the UCOP’s ability to finally reach an agreement with the union. 
“The outside political pressure from state rep -
resentatives, viral Op-Eds, and social media cam -
paigns gained traction during a critical time of bargaining [led to the decision],” Iatarola said. “A two-day unfair labor practices (ULP) strike with final exams on the horizon is not an ideal situa -
tion for anyone in higher ed. I think UCOP’s La -
bor Relations team realized the union, lecturers, students, and community members had already mobilized and were not leaving the bargaining table quietly.”
Although the picket line was called off on 
that Wednesday, UC-AFT nevertheless decided to gather, flipping their planned What began as a strike turned into a celebration for the UCSD community. Gathered outside of the Gilman LABOR

Distributes 
Third Round of  
High Education 
Emergency 
Relief  Funding
By LUCY KEANE
Contributing Writer
The passage of the Ameri -
can Rescue Plan Act of 2021, a 
stimulus bill passed by the U.S. 
Congress and signed into law by 
President Joe Biden on March 
11, 2021, allocated an additional 
$39.6 billion to support universi -
ties in their retention of students 
during the COVID-19 pandemic 
as part of the Higher Education 
Emergency Relief Fund. UC San 
Diego recently completed the al -
location of a third round of High Education Emergency Relief 
Grants.
Under the ARP provisions, 
public and private non-profit in -
stitutions must use half of their 
funds for emergency grants to 
students and the other half may 
be used for institutional purpos -
es which must include programs 
for monitoring and suppress -
ing COVID-19, and outreach to students regarding potential fi -
nancial aid adjustments. Unlike HEERF I (funded by the CARES act) and HEERF II (funded by 
the CRRSAA), the third round 
of the distribution of the High -
er Education Emergency Relief 
Fund Grant (HEERF III), was 
funded by the ARP. 
UCSD first announced that 
it would be receiving HEERF 
funds in 2020. They distributed 
the funds they received from HEERF I ($17,444,885 from 
the CARES act) over the time 
spanning from April 2020 to 
December 2020 and distributed 
the funds from HEERF II ($17.4 
million from the CRRSAA) 
throughout January 2021 to Sep -
tember 2021.
While the U.S. Department 
of Education states that students 
are eligible for HEERF III so long 
as they are enrolled in a higher 
education institution during the 
COVID pandemic, it asks  in -
stitutions to prioritize students 
with need. In their HEERF FAQ 
page, the Department of Educa -
tion includes students receiv -
ing Pell Grants or other federal/state-based aid as well as those 
facing extraordinary financial 
hardships like the loss of em -
ployment, reduced income, or basic need insecurity. 
As reported by the Financial 
Aid and Scholarships Office, UCSD received $91,774,980. Of 
that amount, $45,889,163 must 
be given in direct grants to stu -
dents.
The Financial Aid and Schol -
arships Office identifies 4 dif -
ferent causes to which they will distribute the funds: up to $1000 
to support Pell Grant recipients, 
up to $900 for “needy students” 
— individuals with an expected 
family contribution of up to 
$24,000 — plus an additional

$100 if the student has a dependent, and up to $1,500 to provide tech -
nology grants for first-year Pell Grant recipients. 
The federal government stipulated that students are eligible to re -
ceive HEERF III, regardless of whether they filled out the FAFSA. For UCSD students however, HEERF III funds will 
only be distributed to students eligible to com -
plete FAFSA, excluding non-citizens without an 
Alien Registration Number. 
The school highlights an alternate option for 
California Dream Act eligible undergraduates, 
stating that they will be awarded with equal sup -
port but through different sources. Graduate and 
professional students, on the other hand, can be 
considered regardless of citizenship.
Learning about the availability of resources, 
however, has proved to be somewhat of a chal -
lenge for students. Thurgood Marshall College freshman Fernanda Sevilla said that she was ini -
tially unaware of her eligibility for the grant until 
another student, after receiving their own sup -
port, directed her towards the resource. 
“I received the HEERF grant without going 
through any sort of process, so I can’t put a mea -
sure on its accessibility,” Sevilla said. “I actually 
heard about the HEERF Grant through a suite -
mate. I didn’t even know the grant existed.”
But after her discovery of the grant, Fernanda 
highlighted the efficiency of its distribution, stat -
ing that she “did receive the grant quickly and without any complications.”
According to the UCSD Financial Aid and 
Scholarships Office, the funds for Fall Quarter have been completely distributed. As of Nov. 22, 2021, the application process is closed for 
UCSD students to apply for further grants.

San Diego Trolley Rolls Into Campus With New Mid-Coast 
Extension
The sounds of commotion, laughter, and 
music filled the air on Sunday, Nov. 21, at Earl Warren College Field as the Metro -
politan Transit System (MTS) hosted an event celebrating the opening of the new Mid-Coast Trolley Extension. The new Mid-Coast Trolley will carry the Blue Line of the San Diego Trolley from Downtown San Diego to campus and University City, with trains running every 15 minutes. This will allow UC San Diego students, staff, and community members a one-seat ride to Downtown, South Bay, and the Mexican border. 
“The trolley will connect the university 
to the community like never before, ” Asso -
ciate Director of University Communica -
tions Leslie Sepuka said.  
The event saw roughly 8,000 commu -
nity members attend. Notable attendees included Congressman Scott Peters, Con -
gressman Juan Vargas, San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria, and Catherine Blakespear, the mayor of Encinitas and chair of the San Diego Association of Governments (SAN-DAG), the region’s chief transportation or -
ganization overseeing the project’s planning and construction.
“It’s not frequently you open a $2.17 bil -
lion, 11-mile, nine-stop trolley line, ” Blake -
spear said.  
According to SANDAG Director of En-
gineering and Construction Sharon Hum-phreys, San Diego MTS, SANDAG, and UCSD worked to create a carnival-like at-mosphere for the event. Free hot dogs and kettle corn were available to attendees, 
along with a rock climbing wall and game 
booths. 
“Because UC San Diego is such an im -
portant partner, we worked with the univer -
sity to hold our grand opening celebration 
on campus … [the event] was a phenom -
enal effort that required dozens of people to make it happen, ” Humphreys said. 
As the largest public transportation 
project in the region’s history, preparations to meet the Nov. 21 opening required ur -
gency and attention to detail. Humphreys noted that supply chain problems nearly derailed the planned opening date, as the safety fencing needed for stations was de -
layed. 
“[SANDAG] had to send people to the 
[manufacturer’s] plant in Wisconsin, to monitor, supervise and encourage the de -
livery of the materials … people were work -
ing 24/7 to make sure that it was installed in time for opening, ” Humphreys said. 
In the weeks leading up to opening, 
SANDAG also conducted over a hundred system checks and safety tests, trained new operators, and ordered 45 new Siemens light rail vehicles to operate the line. Col -
laboration between SANDAG and UCSD was critical to ensure the project’s success, according to Sepuka.
“Constructing a project of this scale 
and complexity on an active campus re -
quired close collaboration, ” Sepuka said. “The partnership among SANDAG, MTS, [California Department of Transportation], UC San Diego and the contractor has been nothing short of extraordinary. ” 
According to Sepuka, UCSD has been 
hard at work preparing for an influx of visi -
tors to campus, establishing over 250 “Way -
point” QR codes which display campus maps and nearby amenities when scanned. The University also partnered with Spin to add 600 rentable electric bikes and scooters to campus, and has worked on improve -
ments to major pedestrian areas such as Ridge Walk to boost capacity and accom -
modate traffic from bikes, scooters, and skateboards. 
Sepuka also mentioned that while 
UCSD does not expect a major influx of traffic to the libraries or residential dining halls, the administration has worked with businesses in and around Price Center to ensure increased retail supply. 
Sepuka went on to express hope that the 
new line would alleviate the housing situa -
tion around campus, adding that “the trol -
ley will provide access to many new housing options throughout the county. ”
UCSD noted that it made several ser -
vice changes and upgrades to public transit around campus. 
“Triton Transit replaced the Hillcrest 
Shuttle between the La Jolla campus and Hillcrest via Old Town with the new Hill -
crest Express service, removing duplication with the UC San Diego Blue Line and dou
-
bling the frequency of service between the 
Old Town Transit Center and the Hillcrest 
Medical Center, ” Sepuka said. 
Notably, the 201/202 bus route was also 
moved further south, running along La Jol-
la Village Drive from campus to Westfield UTC, instead of its old route along Medical Center Drive and Regents Road. Addition -
ally, MTS has built new parking structures 
at the Nobel Drive and UTC stations. 
For commuting students such as Elea -
nor Roosevelt College sophomore Valenti -
na Dupond, the new trolley line represents 
possible relief. Dupond drives from her home in Imperial Beach daily to get to class, a 30-minute commute in each direction.
“The biggest issues I encounter [as a 
commuting student] are gas … and park -
ing, because the parking situation is so bad, ” Dupond said. “I hope to use the trolley be -
cause it will save me a lot of money, since I won’t be paying for gas or for parking at school. ” 
At the event, Mayor Gloria expressed 
hope that the new line would not only open up new opportunities for the UCSD com -
munity, but for the San Diego community as a whole. 
“This isn’t about trolley cars, railway 
ties, or catenary wires. This is about people, ” San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria said. 
Students, staff, and faculty wishing to 
ride the new line can board at the V A Medi-cal Center, UC San Diego Central Campus, and UC San Diego Health La Jolla stations on campus. The San Diego Trolley operates 20 hours a day, seven days a week.

Responding to Violence With Nonviolence
On Aug. 25, 2020, then 
17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse 
travelled from his hometown in 
Illinois to a protest at Kenosha, 
Wisconsin, bringing an AR-15 style rifle and a medical kit, 
claiming to protect businesses 
and provide medical aid. During the shooting and subsequent trial, we see that after 
Rittenhouse shot the empty-
handed Joseph Rosenbaum, a group of people started coming 
after him in response. In the 
ensuing chase, Anthony Huber, who used a skateboard to hit 
Rittenhouse, was shot dead. And 
because of a misunderstanding in which Gaige Grosskreutz thought Rittenhouse was an 
active shooter, he pointed a gun 
at Rittenhouse, allegedly to stop him from hurting more people. 
And because Rittenhouse had 
a gun pointed at him, he shot Grosskreutz in self defense.
Notice how each person 
Rittenhouse shot had increasingly dangerous equipment, putting Rittenhouse 
in an increasingly dangerous 
situation, leading to more shots fired and more bloodshed. This 
domino effect of violence is what 
we need to avoid.
Although the jury has 
found Rittenhouse not guilty, the trial has brought up many unanswered problems including 
hate, racism, and amateurish 
vigilantism. While emotions may run high, instead of 
pointing fingers at each other, 
we need to confront the broader root problems that gave rise to the tragedy to prevent it from happening again. This article will specifically address gun culture and the normalization of 
self-defense using deadly force.
First, we must acknowledge 
that not all circumstances 
are safe or perceived to be 
safe. Through the news, we 
are constantly made aware of attacks on protestors, attacks on innocent Asian elderly, mass 
shootings, etc., which all point 
to the potential violence one may encounter. Because there is a risk 
or perceived risk of violence, it is 
unreasonable to expect everyone to willingly enter a potentially 
dangerous situation, even with 
good intentions, without any equipment whatsoever, especially 
in a charged gathering such 
as a protest. However, instead of equipping themselves with deadly weapons like guns, people 
should use non-lethal defensive 
equipment in a confrontation that can ensure their own safety, 
as well as others.
While there is nothing wrong 
with ensuring the safety of oneself and others, the problem 
now is that there are people equipping themselves for self-
defense solely with tools that can 
be used offensively. For example, knowingly putting yourself in a 
potentially dangerous situation 
with only a gun, without first using protective equipment such as a shield. Because there is no 
alternative equipment, when 
there is a perceived threat that seems beyond the possibility of 
settling in a civil manner, then 
the only readily available tool to respond is the deadly gun.
Also, the sheer presence of a 
deadly weapon can make others around feel threatened. If two people are similarly equipped with deadly weapons, then in the resulting tension, any slight gesture may be misinterpreted 
and make one person feel that 
the use of a weapon is justified. Once one person uses a weapon, the other person would also feel 
endangered enough to use their 
weapon. Thus, both people come to act violently because they feel justified by the threat, real or 
imagined, posed by the other, 
hence propagating the violence in a catastrophic feedback loop, 
as seen in the tragedy at Kenosha.
How do we break this cycle? 
Let us consider if hypothetically, the person claiming self-defense 
has a shield instead of a gun. And ideally, a shield can block 
anything, but can only be used 
defensively. If two people both have shields, then there can be no aggressor because neither person 
has the ability to do so. In the 
case that one of the two people actually is an aggressor, then 
the defender can use the shield 
to defend without harming the aggressor, until the aggressor is 
arrested.
Realistically, a shield does 
not guarantee your safety. But nor does a gun. And more so, a 
specialized defensive tool should be better at guaranteeing safety 
than a specialized offensive 
tool, not only because the shield 
is specialized to defend, but because firing a gun can escalate 
a situation and lead to more 
danger and bloodshed.  
Although the law currently 
allows the justification of use 
of force in certain situations, 
such as in the Castle doctrine, morally and for a more 
peaceful world, we should 
strive to counter violence with nonviolence. Practically, this means developing and relying on many layers of nonviolent methods so that the last resort 
of violence is never reached. 
Although each individual layer is not perfect, the many layers cover for each other to form a safe and reliable system, similar 
to the Swiss cheese model used 
in mitigating the pandemic.
Right now, because of gun 
culture, many people default to guns for self defense. However, a quick search on the internet 
shows that one can buy NIJ level 4 
armor able to stop AR-15 rounds for the same price as buying an AR-15. Though body armor does 
not guarantee safety, this is only 
one layer in the Swiss cheese model. For example, instead of 
showing up with nothing else 
but a gun, Rittenhouse could have gotten more training on 
peacefully defusing a situation, 
made sure he was with a friend at all times, carried a radio, used 
a shield, and more. 
While it may seem easy 
to adopt defensive tools as an alternative to weapons, gun 
culture poses several barriers. First, is that for some people, guns have become a symbol for 
their ideologies. One obstacle to 
adopting peaceful means of self defense is that one may argue 
that guns are the best way of 
defending oneself in a society where you might be attacked 
by someone also wielding a 
gun. However, in the previous examples, we have already seen how bringing a gun leads to 
putting yourself in increasingly 
dangerous situations.
One may also argue that a gun 
is more convenient. In rebuttal, there are also small non-lethal tools such as pepper spray and strobe lights that weigh less than most handguns. You can also learn martial arts. Though one 
may then argue that learning 
martial arts requires training, so do guns, and if you are untrained with a gun, you will pose a bigger danger to yourself 
and innocent bystanders. Plus if 
you learn martial arts, you don’t have to carry anything with you.
Indeed, thousands of years 
of human conflict have already seen the development of a host 
of technologies, many of which 
are non-lethal or non-violent. The biggest barrier we face now is the culture that prevents 
many of us from recognizing, 
adopting, and developing non-violent technologies as opposed 
to deadly weapons.
Violence begets violence, 
and we need to stop the cycle by responding to violence with 
nonviolence. Because of the way things are now, we cannot 
reasonably assume that we will 
never encounter violence, so to defend ourselves and still avoid 
using violence, we should rely on 
and work to develop nonviolent methods and technologies.
Perhaps the root problem is 
the ugly side of human nature in general. We all make mistakes when we are influenced by 
certain ideologies and in the heat 
of passion, and technology serves to amplify or mitigate the effects. 
While the mistakes we make 
are perhaps less controllable, we should have greater control over technology. It’s almost 
as if technology is a way of 
transferring human reasoning to situations where reasoning is less 
possible. Therefore, we need to 
use technology wisely.We need to stop violence by responding with nonviolence.

I stare, perplexed and amazed. 
Her skin is clear and poreless, 
her forehead and hairline both 
perfectly symmetrical to the rest of her face. Her full lips 
are artificially enhanced — but 
not so much that they appear fake, or plastic. Her eyebrows are thinner and more arched, 
the eyes more slanted, and their 
normal deep brown tinted with gorgeous honey highlights. 
Her nose is slim and feminine, 
almost delicately proportional. In sum, the woman is beautiful 
yet unfamiliar — “is that me?” 
I think to myself for the first time that a selfie turned out better than my reflection in 
the mirror. But as I continue to 
stare at the selfie I took with an Instagram filter, I grow more 
and more uncomfortable with 
the subtle enhancements done to my face. I take a selfie without 
any filters and flip back and 
forth between the two pictures, trying to reassure myself that 
the heavy feeling in my stomach 
is an overreaction. It’s possible that I’m actually just as gorgeous as the Instagram baddies, right?
I am well-aware of how 
toxic social media is; I did a whole research paper on its 
addictive qualities when I was 
in community college. During quarantine, I made sure to limit 
my time on the most popular 
social media platforms for the sake of maintaining my mental health and keeping up my 
grades. However, it appeared I 
had missed one negative impact that social media has in my 
research report —the hit to self-
esteem that filters, especially Instagram filters, have on 
people, specifically women and 
girls. Unsurprisingly enough, it is highly possible that Instagram 
knew of the negative impact 
that it had on the self-image of young women and girls. There is evidence to suggest 
that Instagram knew about the 
By Saida Hassan
Design Editorand depression that push you 
to partake in the destruction of 
your body image even more. 
For me personally, I struggled 
especially with my “Facetuned” selfie because I also couldn’t 
recognize the race of the person in the camera anymore. Being a Somali woman living in a nearly 
all-white suburb and going to 
a majority white school, most 
people cannot identify what race 
I am, let alone where Somalia is 
on a map. Unfortunately, I was 
still exposed to anti-Blackness 
while growing up, even though I was never around Black 
people. I internalized this anti-
Blackness and as I learned to live around almost all white 
people, I sometimes accepted it 
as a compliment that someone thought I was Moroccan, or that 
a South Asian person mistook me for Indian. My sparse 
experiences with Islamophobia 
also didn’t help, so I generally 
accepted whichever race the newest white person I met 
assigned to me. I figured it didn’t 
matter.
Now that I am an adult, 
my issues of self-identity and 
questions of representation have, 
for the most part, been laid to 
rest. I take pride in my distinctly 
East African five-head, my 
larger-than-white-people nose, 
my giant brown eyes. But for the first time in several years, 
the unfamiliar eyes I saw staring 
back at me on my iPhone also challenged my Somali pride and 
rendered me speechless. She was 
beautiful, but she wasn’t me. She looked racially ambiguous in a way that only Instagram models 
can pull off. The uncomfortable feeling of inadequacy regarding 
my Somaliniimo was as acute 
as ever. I contemplated the fact 
that if I made my account public and posted this selfie on my 
story, lots of attention from both 
men and women would be sent my way. I was hyper conscious of the way the Instagram 
filter had somehow picked up 
on all of my insecurities and 
fixed them, as if the algorithm 
could automatically determine which aspects of the human face “under-performed’’ relative to 
all the others. After all, she was 
more beautiful than who I saw in the mirror. I had indeed achieved 
the “Insta-baddie” face that I 
commonly see while scrolling through my For You Page, but 
at what cost? I had erased my 
ethnic features and corrupted my self-esteem. Without too 
much conscious effort on my 
part, I became the unattainable 
beauty standard and lost my priceless racial identity.
I deleted both selfies and the 
Instagram app on my phone and decided that it would be a while before Instagram saw me again. 
It has been three weeks since 
that selfie was taken, and those honey brown eyes still stare up 
at me every time I open up my 
camera. I wonder how long it will take before they completely

a staple of which has always been the odd love story. In the past he’s covered such stories 
from the perspective of those struggling with social anxiety, and in “ /T_he Phantom /T_hread” 
he explored themes of maternal love. However, his newest spin on this old topic is what makes “Licorice Pizza” stand out amongst the rest.
Alana Haim, of the band Haim, plays Alana Kane, a directionless 25-year-old who 
meets 15-year-old Gary Valentine, a young entrepreneur, portrayed by Cooper Hoﬀ man. 
/T_his is both actors’ debut roles and it was a stellar way to make a ﬁrst impression. /T_he ﬁlm 
is spent exploring their developing relationship and its various problems made more ap -
parent by their ten year age gap. Licorice Pizza begins with its best foot forward. From the start you’re struck with the strange chemistry the two characters immediately share. Gary is optimistic and naive, while Alana is dismissive and existential. /T_his charming ﬁre and 
ice dynamic is what carries the ﬁlm and allows the audience to connect to these two con -
trasting characters. Gary represents the part of Alana that’s been broken down by societal expectation and conformity. A /f_ter getting her to quit her job as a photographers assistant 
and involving her in his waterbed business, her attitude completely changes and the two grow from each other's company.A colorful and high-quality title sequence was enough to grasp 
my attention and curiosity when I ﬁrst started watching Apple TV’s 
“Foundation.””. Clean shots and pristine visual e ﬀects transported me 
oﬀ-world to the planet Synnax, where I learned about Gaal Dornick 
(Lou Llobell) and her gi /f_t in mathematics. Given the opportunity to 
work alongside Professor Hari Seldon (Jared Harris) on the galactic empire’s main planet Trantor, Gaal leaves her home on Synnax only to be thrown into a war of politics. Gaal realizes the true reason she was brought to Trantor was to prove Hari Seldon’s theory of psychohistory, a science he created, which suggests the end of the current Empire is near. Being that the Empire is currently ruled by three clones of Cleon I (the previous ruler of the last galactic empire), each at di ﬀerent stages 
of life, anything that poses a threat to their eternal rule is blasphemous and dangerous. /T_hus the order was given to continue Hari’s work to 
create a “foundation” for the survivors of the presumed catastrophic events to base their continued survival on. Seeing Hari’s prediction come to fruition across 10 fast-paced episodes was like experiencing whiplash as the series jumps around to di ﬀerent tension-ridden events 
that span across 400+ years.ARTS & ENTERTAINMENTCONTACT THE EDITOR

While the plot may seem confusing and hard to keep track of, as the series went on I 
began to draw the connections between the seeds of information planted in previous epi -
sodes. BecauseBeing that this series is based on a science ﬁction trilogy of novels by Isaac 
Asimov, I could tell this show faced the challenge of deciding what to include on screen. 
Key pieces of information and backstory were told through Gaal’s narration rather than 
shown which caused some scenes to fall ﬂat. /T_here were also a number of times where 
scenes would cut or the next episode would start and the feeling that I missed something would gnaw at me throughout the episode. Such as in episode 2 when all of the sudden Gaal, Hari, and other followers of the “foundation plan” were suddenly months into their journey of exile to the planet Terminus. Never addressing this time skip was disorienting and leaves one big question mark even a /f_ter ﬁnishing the ﬁ rst season. 
With such strong performances from a large cast, no scene was truly disappointing. 
Whether Gaal was in discourse with Hari over the fate of humanity, or the middle-aged version of Cleon,, was simply sitting at the head of the Empire’s dinner table, I was en -
tranced by the actors’ presence. I admit, at the start, that the character of Gaal Dornick 
being a math genius seemed to be shoved down my throat. Giving her certain quirks, such 
as counting prime numbers when she is nervous, jumped out at me as a cringeworthy push to make sure the audience knew she was a student of academia at heart. Leah Harvey’s character Salvor, a warden and soldier on the planet Terminus, brought a much needed sense of humanity to the story as her character’s motives and actions, rooted in defending her family and friends ﬁ rst before serving the Empire, were most relatable. Lee Pace’s acting shone the brightest for me as one man was able to convey many eras of 
the same person, each with di ﬀerent motivations. /T_h ere was one scene in episode 2 where 
Pace delivers a powerful monologue and gives the command to obliterate two civilizations with such poise that I felt chills run down my back as I watched. I can only assume his 
role as Elven King /T_hranduil in /T_he Hobbit Trilogy prepared him well to play someone 
in a place of power. Even minor characters such as Cleon’s right-hand servant, Demerzel, 
enhanced the atmosphere ensuring I was never taken out of the universe I was pulled into.  
/T_his show oﬀ ers everything Dune does and much more. Taking such an involved story 
and developing it into a series elongated the amount of e ﬃcient world building and char -
acter development that could be accomplished. High contrasted shots of landscapes and actors complimented the aesthetic of a high society presented to be all-powerful. Ten epi -
sodes that span for about 50 minutes join together to make something that feels complete yet leaves you yearning for more. Exploring the idea of revisiting the past to better un -
derstand the future through a science ﬁction story puts the concept of learning from past 
mistakes into a creative and imaginative space. I also found myself drawing parallels of 
this ﬁctional universe to climate change and the lack of empathy shown by world leaders 
today. By the end of the ﬁrst season I felt fully immersed in the universe creators David 
Goyer and Josh Friedman translated from Asimov’s books to the small screen and will be 
eagerly waiting for the recently greenlit season 2.

Film Review: Licorice Pizza

If there’s one trait the two unequivocally share, it’s their immaturity. /T_h is is ultimate -
ly what gives way to their realistic character ﬂ aws. /T_h ey act erratically at times, making 
choices that pluck at the heartstrings. O /f_tentimes it’s one person getting jealous over 
the other, creating a unique tug of war dynamic between the two. It’s a “will they, won’t they?” kind of scenario, but made into a comedic and bitterly relatable part of the ﬁ lm. 
As per PTA, the directing and writing is top notch. /T_h e world is cra /f_ted so seamlessly 
you almost don’t notice yourself being more and more engrossed in 1970’s Los Angeles. Several character shi /f_ts unfold throughout the narrative, keeping the audience constantly 
engaged. While this may sound redundant, PTA remains a master of tonal consistency. /T_here are moments of comedy but others that are far more somber and slow. However, 
nothing feels out of place or half-baked. Each action subtly propels the story further.
Going further, the ﬁ lm is simply gorgeous to witness in all its 70 mm glory. It’s as if 
the streets of Los Angeles never veered from its historical roots. Making the ﬁ lm take 
place in the disco era is a great idea for the overarching backdrop. It’s easy to forget that in the modern age, we have far more avenues of connection than we did in the past. However, in the ﬁ lm a simple phone call from one character to another is a major mo -
ment between the two of them. Chance meetings feel a lot more natural and overall people are con ﬁned to being more 
intimate with one another. PTA does a good job of reminding you of that, as each charac -
ter interaction is very meaningful, not a second wasted. If that wasn’t enough the natural vocabulary of each personality includes a wide range of old slang evocative of the peace-loving times.
“Licorice Pizza” isn’t an over the top story that’s meant to make you change the way you 
think about love, nor does it really have to be. It plays out more like a long vignette tem -
pered with nostalgia and classic romantic beats we’ve all grown to appreciate. A Christmas release date almost feels appropriate for the ﬁlm despite not having anything to do with 
the holiday. It’s welcoming and familiar but special enough to be considered a gi /f_t. /gid00040/gid00081/gid00064/gid00067/gid00068: A

intuitiveness and inventiveness that is weaved into the Black experience, “making a way 
out of no way, and making it up as you go along,” as Kevin Young writes in “ /T_he Grey 
Album: /T_he Blackness of Blackness.” /T_his intuitiveness permeates washington-queen’s 
work, disrupting traditional narrative structure, breaking down categorical boundaries 
of documentary, photography, ﬁction, and poetry. 
Deconstructing conventional forms of ﬁlm, washington-queen’s short video art 
piece “Ode to AND1 Basketball: Notes on the Black Sporting Body” deals with Black identity, reconstructing the corporeal body into a work of art. /T_his short follows the 
structure of a poetic-prose essay which transforms everyday gestures and movements 
to emphasize the agility and swi /f_tness of the Black body. washington-queen introduces 
the video describing the impact AND1 Basketball audio-visual mixtapes had on their 
childhood, pairing the narration with a slideshow of photos. As an athlete themselves, 
they utilized these mixtapes as a study tool to help guide them in their journey as 
a basketball player. Taking inspiration, washington-queen focuses on their ﬂeeting 
movements, as they move freely amongst the other streetball players. washington-
queen starts to mold a new relationship between art and the Black body. While watch -
ing the video, audiences are faced with a split-screen — one side capturing the AND1 
Basketball mixtapes and the other showcasing washington-queen through a MacBook 
photo booth recording. /T_his intuitively pushes viewers to draw a connection, however 
small or subconscious, between the present and the past. /T_hey create a new temporal 
space in which both present and past coexist. As the mixtapes play, washington-queen 
creates a side-by-side analysis of the streetball players in motion, as their “arms spread 
like [an] angel, Black man airborne,” creating poetry of their movements and view -
ing their bodies as otherworldly. Focusing on the ﬁlming techniques of the mixtapes, 
they describe the video editor’s use of excessive repetition “as an invitation to read the black body di ﬀerently, not only as an object but as a phenomenon.” washington-queen 
uses this aspect of the AND1 mixtapes to spotlight the movements of the Black body, 
but also to “liberate it from subjective representation, from object … from mere sports 
entertainment.” Emphasizing the lively nature of the Black body, washington-queen fo -
cuses on removing the Black body from the gaze of white spectatorship, creating a new 
perspective for audiences to view the Black body as art and giving the physical being a 
poetic meaning. In doing so, washington-queen emphasizes the intuitiveness of both the editor and players’ artistry. By incorporating the mixtape into their poetic-prose piece, washington-queen carefully and purposefully reframes viewers’ interpretation of 
AND1 as more than just entertainment, allowing viewers to experience Black Noetics 
in real time. washington-queen ultimately formulates a new meaning of the Black body 
through this quick 4-minute video, reconstructing a new meaning of Black identity 
and its relationship to spectators and their societal expectations. UCSD has been 
home to many great artists and dana washington-queen is no exception. /T_heir work is 
actively deconstructing and rebuilding the ways in which audiences consume media 
and art, and creating new spaces for Blackness to just be. /T_hey are currently planning 
a solo exhibition with the Institute for Contemporary Art at Virginia Commonwealth University, where they will debut a new piece focused on the relation of the Black body 
to the labor of spectacle in sports and the broadcasting technology used. We encour -

Our introduction to dana washington-queen’s art came through Communications 
Professor Zeinabu irene Davis’ Black Women Filmmakers class, where washington-
queen was a guest lecturer. /T_hough washington-queen identi ﬁes as non-binary, their 
presence as a guest speaker for the class was not at all out of place. /T_heir work deals 
intimately with the central intention of Professor Davis’ course: representation and ad -
vocacy in not only ﬁlm, but the art and media world at large for those who have been 
traditionally excluded and marginalized from mainstream narratives.
dana washington-queen attended California State University, Long Beach where 
they received their bachelor’s degree in English-Composition. /T_hey subsequently 
entered the Visual Arts master’s program at UC San Diego, completing it in the Spring of 2020. washington-queen is a non-binary Black poet, video artist, photographer, and educator whose work focuses on representations of Blackness in media. /T_heir work 
reframes traditional spaces of media in an act of rupture with institutional ideas about art: opening up and creating a space for new ways of thinking and new lenses through which to consume art. /T_he work forces viewers to confront the ways in which their 
gazes have been in ﬂuenced by wider social institutions, bringing them face to face 
with harsh truths about the forces that shape and construct our realities.

NELSON  ESPINAL 
From Oct. 24 to 26, Point 
Loma Nazarene University host -
ed one of the most prestigious 
speech and debate competitions 
in Southern California: the 2021 
Sunset Cliffs Classic Forensics 
Tournament. 
In the tournament, students 
from universities ranging from University of Southern Cali -
fornia to Vanderbilt competed to present the best arguments across the two categories of speech and debate, claiming suc -
cesses for both themselves and the schools they represent. 
By the competition’s end, the 
UC San Diego Speech and De -
bate Team won the prestigious 4-Year School First Place Sweep -
stakes Award, an honor present -
ed to the school with the best overall performance.
When describing the team’s 
experience in the competition, head coach Robert Campbell said he “felt that Dwight Eisen -
hower invading Europe on D-
Day.” 
Of the team’s ranks of 98 
active members, a staggering 
62 UCSD students brandished their skills at the Sunset Cliffs tournament. The team boasts a large number of trophies, over -
filling their school-granted tro -
phy case. Unlike most Speech and Debate teams, however, the UCSD team’s trophy case does not reside within the Communi -
cations Department, but rather in the Rady School of Manage -
ment. 
Though most speech and de -
bate teams remain within the Communications Departments of other schools, the UCSD Communications Department has declined the team’s requests. 
“Our communications de -
partment has been asked twice, if they would like to work with me to build a program, and they have, courteously, responded with ‘no, we have no interest in doing that, all we do is teach theory over here,” Campbell explained. “So, even though I believe theory, in order to be validated, needs to be put to practice ... practicing commu -
nication theory means that you practice speech and debate. But that’s why; the only reason that this debate program is over at the business school is because that’s where I am.”
The team’s strong connection 
to Rady stems from their unique journey as a team. Despite their size and skill, the UCSD Speech and Debate Team remains a Stu -
dent-Run Organization (SRO). 
The team has failed thus far 
to convince the administration to formally recognize them.UCSD Speech and Debate 
first took off in the early 2000s, spearheaded by Professor Dan -
ny Cantrell. Cantrell is now a 
well-known figure in the speech and debate field due to his role in creating the tournament man -
agement software used to this 
day. 
“But Danny left for his other 
job, around 2006,” Campbell 
said. 
The minute Speech and De -
bate lost its faculty advisor, as 
an SRO, the program “died,” 
according to Campell, “because 
then it literally was up to the kids 
to pay for their own fees to go to 
any tournaments.”
The club struggled onwards 
until Spring Quarter of 2018, 
when the final two remaining 
members of the team approached 
Professor Campbell.
Campbell praised his own 
alma mater’s Speech and Debate 
program in his lectures. Thus, 
the hopeful students sought out 
Campbell and asked him to be 
their faculty advisor.
“I said, ‘respectfully, no, I 
won’t,’” Campbell recounted to The UCSD Guardian. “‘What I will do though, is I will be your Head Coach of an entirely new effort to build a full forensics program here at UCSD, starting 
with Speech and Debate.”
As head coach, Campbell 
finds and prepares the team 
for tournaments, handles their 
funding, and teaches students debating skills. He is a potent force in the team’s drive to grow 
bigger and gain recognition.
After establishing their goal, 
the UCSD Speech and Debate Team officially began in the fall 
quarter of 2018, made up of just under two dozen students. As 
the team started out, everything 
remained experimental. 
While Coach Campbell se -
cured classrooms to practice in with Rady, the students stepped 
up as well. They developed a sys -
tem in which senior members 
volunteered their time to bring 
incoming members up to speed. 
As an SRO, the team relies 
on Rady’s classrooms to practice 
and organize for their tourna -
ments. Yet without 
the university’s official support, the team is left without consis -
tent funding.
“I’ve paid all of the debate 
tournament attendance fees and expenses, for four years, out of my own pocket,” said Campbell. 
Though Campbell has been 
able to receive reimbursement for the team’s expenses, it can be a “bureaucratic” process, and the implications are frightening. 
As Professor Campbell nears the 
end of his teaching career and 
looks towards retirement, his primary concern rests with the team. 
“The dilemma is how this 
incredibly successful, student-centered, highly-motivated set of top students get the monkey off  their back of perpetually facing extinction when somebody like me retires,” Campbell said to The Guardian. 
Much like with Danny 
Cantrell’s early 2000s team, as a Student-Run Organization, the students could lack the funding and support to continue their ef -
forts if they lost their faculty ad -
visor. Campbell put off retiring for a specific reason: he intends to fight for the Speech and De -
bate Team’s position as an official UCSD program before he leaves the school. 
In Campbell’s own research, 
he discovered that “the recurring 
and number one critique of col -
lege graduates is that they don’t 
know how to make a presenta -
tion to management, or to their 
team, and they couldn’t win an 
argument if their life depended on it.” 
He believes that the universi -
ty is lacking in their attempts to 
teach these skills, commenting 
that “The communications de -
partment of this giant university 
has one public speaking class. 
That’s it. That’s it.”
Campbell critiques the uni -
versity, saying that despite its claims of being “student-cen -
tered,” UCSD isn’t properly do -
ing its job unless it trains stu -
dents in public speaking skills as 
well.
“Because if we are not for -
mally preparing these kids to go 
out in the real world of business, 
and be able to research, organize 
and then present and persuade 
people, we’re not doing the full 
job,” Campbell told The Guard -
ian.
Campbell also emphasizes 
the engagement that the Speech 
and Debate Team brings. He re -
counted a conversation he heard between one of his peers and 
Dean of Rady, Lisa Ordóñez. 
“There is one organization, 
though, on campus, that appears 
to be fully engaged, and that’s Speech and Debate,” Ordóñez commented to Cambell.
With the team’s increas -
ing momentum, winning four sweepstakes awards across only 
three tournaments during Fall 
Quarter 2021, Campbell de -scribes the team as a “juggernaut 
of successes.” 
Due to their competitive na -
ture, Campbell and the team are 
often accused of “chasing gold-colored plastic,” referring to the 
wooden and plastic trophies of
-
fered at tournaments. 
However, despite all the suc -
cess the team has found in com -
petitions, they have yet to travel to an out-of-state tournament, or even one beyond southern Cali -
fornia. The team’s opportunities are severely limited due to lack of funding and the ever-looming pandemic.
Campbell described his expe -
rience as a collegiate debater in a program in which he traveled the nation to compete. He hopes to offer his own team members the opportunity to do the same be -
fore he retires. 
The members of the team 
share Campbell’s vision for the organization and in the struggles to elevate their status. Gregory Shen, the team’s social media chair, remembered his reac -
tion after first hearing about the team’s status. 
“Initially, when I joined the 
team, I was really passionate about Coach’s mission, and I had had lunch with him one time, and he had talked about the 
challenges that we talked about 
earlier,” Shen told The Guardian. 
“It really got me kind of mad at the school for the first time ever in my academic career, cause it seemed like they were underes -
timating us. And what I really want is for the school to take us seriously.” 
The head coach urges the uni -
versity to prioritize the Speech and Debate Team in the same way that they would prioritize any intercollegiate competitive matter. 
“What I’m striving to do is to 
get the university’s attention at the same level that the basketball team has achieved,” Campbell explained. 
As UCSD transitions to Divi -
sion I success in many sports, the Speech and Debate Team hopes to find itself a place in the evolu -
tion of UCSD’s competitive pres -
ence. 
“We’re supposed to be an aca -
demic institution first,” Camp -
bell insisted. “And we have the golden opportunity to demon -
strate the strength of our aca -
demic efforts by supporting the one endeavor of intercollegiate competition that is totally aca -
demic, and that is Speech and Debate.”By Miriya Huie

 N ow that Thanksgiving has passed, it is time to get into the holiday spirit! 
That means listening to festive music, decorating your house, and praying for snow 
(though the last one is pretty unlikely in sunny San Diego). As a child, I always started off the Christmas season by brainstorming what I wanted to ask Santa for. This year, I figured I would continue the tradition, and share my picks with all of you. So, no matter what you are celebrating this winter holiday, prepare to enjoy my Christmas list, sent to Saint Nicholas himself. 
1.  A Magic Brita
When I first came to college, I knew there would be some challenges. I thought that 
I would have trouble making friends, give in to bad study habits, or develop a terrible sleep schedule. And even though all of these expectations came true, none of them even came close to the trials of the Brita. I’m convinced the founders of the Brita company have set out to make my life a living hell. If the Brita is empty, I have to fill it. But do I shove it in the sink in my bathroom, or go through the effort of leaving the suite? Once I drink some water, do I leave it half empty, or take the long hike to the sink to refill it again? Do I put it in the fridge and leave no space for anything else, or keep it outside and drink room temperature water? Even now, as I’m typing this, the water filter mocks me from the corner of my desk. I’m asking Santa for a new and improved Brita that refills and cleans itself. Hopefully, it will solve all my problems in life. 
2.  A Laundry Machine
If Santa truly knows who has been bad or good, I hope that whoever keeps on moving 
my laundry gets on the naughty list and stays there. Doing the laundry myself is already such a trial that takes so much effort (and a lack of clean clothes) for me to actually do it. But coming back to see my wet clothes placed on the counter and replaced with someone else’s makes it so much worse. I mean yes, I am aware that I forgot to set a timer and other people need to do their laundry too. And yes, I also know that I cannot expect people to wait five hours for me to take my clothes out. But can they not see how difficult it is for me to do my laundry? They should all have some sympathy, seeing that nobody else knows the struggle of doing laundry the way I do. So I’m asking Santa for my own washing machine so I can finally wash my clothes in peace. 3.  My Dining Dollars Converted into Triton Cash
As a full-grown adult, I think I am mature enough to start asking Santa for money. 
But here on UC San Diego’s campus, the standard U.S. dollar means nothing to me compared to the far more valuable currency of Triton Cash. You can truly use it for anything: food, laundry, vending machines, and more! When I grow up, I hope to have millions of dollars in Triton Cash, just so I can spend it all at Blue Pepper, my favorite restaurant here. It is a great gift option, considering that Santa doesn’t even need to spend his own money on this gift. He can simply convert my Dining Dollars. I’ve seen it done before, and I really don’t mind some of my Dining Dollars being taken away. No disrespect to any of the dining halls here, but I am simply tired of their food. Plus, I have the larger dining plan option and I probably won’t use all of it anyways. So if Santa could just go into my TritonLink and get me more Triton Cash, that would be great. 
4.  A (Completed) Journal
I know, this seems fairly simple compared to the other things I’ve asked for, but hear 
me out. I’m not just asking for a regular journal; I want Santa to give me a journal that has already been written in. A diary, bullet journal,whatever! I do not care as long as it is filled with something. My room is already too cluttered with journals that I said I would write in and use as memorabilia for my grandchildren, only to have them lie blank and empty due to lack of effort. I see videos all the time taunting me with the benefits of journaling, knowing deep down that I could never do it. Just once I would like to have a journal that is already completed. A journal that I could show to my peers and say: “Hey, look what I made!” If I could pretend, for just a moment, that I have the ability to actually journal, then maybe my life will come together like all those self-help videos said it would. 
 
 S o that’s my Christmas list this year. I hope that you enjoyed it, and maybe even 
found some inspiration for your own wish list. If not, it doesn’tno matter, because this list is really only meant for one person, Saint Nick himself. So Santa, when you read this, please give me what I’ve asked for. I worked hard on being a good kid all year, and if you could leave these things underneath the tree, you would make this the best holiday season ever!

Playing in the Zootown 
Classic midseason tournament 
at the University of Montana, 
the UC San Diego’s men’s 
basketball team (4–2) suffered 
their first two losses of the 
season, dropping games to 
Montana and the University 
of Southern Mississippi, 71–61 and 56–55, respectively. The 
consecutive losses will take 
some of the luster off the 4–0 
start for the Tritons, as they 
made their first trip out of 
California since 2019.
In the first game on Nov. 24 
against Montana, the Tritons were in a hole early against the 
home side, going down 13–6 
out of the gate. Three-pointers 
from graduate guard Jake 
Killingsworth and freshman 
forward Francis Nwaokorie kept UCSD in the match, but the Tritons couldn’t get within 
a score as the Montana defense 
kept the clamps on them. But 
after going down 25–18 with 
7:02 left in the first half, the 
Tritons’ senior forward and 
leading scorer Toni Rocak made a paint bucket, followed 
by another paint score from 
Nwaokorie and a triple from 
Killingsworth on consecutive 
possessions to level the score 
at 25. UCSD couldn’t take the 
lead, however, and the Grizzlies were able to carry a slim 32–29 
lead into halftime.
The Tritons didn’t change 
the tide of the game exiting 
the tunnel for the second half, 
as jumper after jumper from 
Montana gave them a quick 8–3 run and an 8-point lead 
with 17:19 remaining. UCSD 
remained on the wrong foot 
down the stretch in the second 
half, as the Montana defense kept them from making a run for the lead. After a pair of free throws from Nwaokorie made 
it 51–45 with 9:21 to go, the 
Grizzlies put the game virtually 
out of reach with a 10–0 run, 
featuring a pair of free throws, 
2 scores from behind the arc, 
and a paint jumper. While Nwaokorie and Rocak were 
effective towards the end of 
the game in a comeback effort, 
UCSD never got within 6 and 
suffered their first loss of the 
season, 71–61.
The Triton loss could largely 
be chalked up to turnovers, as UCSD committed 17 to 
the Grizzlies’ 7; Montana had 
8 steals and 15 points off of 
turnovers, while the Tritons 
didn’t even record a single steal. 
Those extra possessions added up, as UCSD’s loss came despite 
outrebounding Montana 38–24 and shooting an identical 
45.5% mark to the Grizzlies. Nwaokorie was a bright spot for the Tritons in 31 minutes off the 
bench, recording 22 points and 
8 rebounds, both team highs.
Perhaps in recognition of the 
previous night’s performance, 
Nwaokorie made his first career 
start on Thanksgiving against 
Southern Mississippi. The 
Tritons were on fire to start 
the game, going up 15–6 in the 
first 7 minutes on a barrage of 4 
three-pointers from 4 different 
players. The Golden Eagles cut into that lead with 6 straight 
points, and the match turned 
into a low-scoring affair down 
the stretch in the first half as 
UCSD held on to the slimmest of leads. But after Southern Miss 
drew within 3 towards the end 
of the half, the Tritons scored 
the next 6 points, including 
back-to-back points in the paint 
for redshirt sophomore guard Bryce Pope, and UCSD looked 
ready to put the last night’s loss behind them as they went into 
the half up 30–21.
That lead began to fall away 
slowly in the second half, and 
by the halfway point of the 
period, the Golden Eagles had 
completed a 16–6 run to take the lead with 10:51 remaining. 
Nwaokorie scored a three-
pointer on the next possession 
to take the lead back, but UCSD 
couldn’t regain the lead for long, 
and it became clear the contest 
would go down to the wire.
Still, the Tritons looked 
in better shape, as they were in the lead more often than 
not in the final few minutes. 
Indeed, a 5–0 run capped off 
by a Killingsworth bucket gave 
UCSD a five-point lead and provisional control of the game 
with under 3 minutes to go. 
Unfortunately for the Tritons, those would be their last points 
of the contest.
Southern Mississippi’s Isaih 
Moore made a quick jumper to respond, and on the other 
end, Rocak missed a key layup. 
Southern Miss drew fouls on 
their next two possessions, and 
all 4 free throws were good to give the Golden Eagles a 56–55 
lead with 1:43 remaining. On 
the next possession, Pope 
missed a three, and while Rocak 
grabbed the offensive rebound, he promptly had the ball stolen, 
but Southern Miss missed their 
own attempt on the other end of the floor.
With 40 seconds to go, 
Rocak missed another would-be go-ahead bucket in the paint, 
but UCSD wasn’t out of it yet, as 
enough time remained on the 
clock to theoretically allow them 
another possession. However, after the Golden Eagles’ shot 
was off target, Moore grabbed 
the offensive rebound, and the 
Tritons began to foul. Southern 
Miss, however, did not score 
their free throw attempt, giving 
the Tritons one more chance out of a timeout, but no shot 
materialized, and the game ended after almost 2 minutes of 
absolute stalemate, a 56–55 win 
for Southern Miss.
Pope, with 15 points, was 
the only Triton to score double 
figures in the game, as UCSD scored their lowest point total 
of the season for the second 
straight day. While turnovers 
weren’t as imbalanced as the 
night before, the key for the 
Golden Eagles was their bench, 
with the Southern Miss bench outscoring the starters with 31 
points, compared to just 8 for 
the Tritons’ bench.
While UCSD was scheduled 
to play the University of North 
Carolina, Wilmington the next 
day, the Seahawks had dropped out of the tournament 2 days 
earlier due to a flu outbreak 
among the team, and the Tritons 
ended their trip to Montana 
empty-handed after coming in 
with significant momentum. 
The UCSD squad will next 
return to RIMAC Arena to host 
Eastern Michigan University on 
Dec. 2, then take a 10-day break 
before travelling to play Seattle University on Dec. 12.Men’s Basketball Suffers First Losses

In the second-to-last home 
game for the team, UC San 
Diego’s women’s volleyball 
team looked to finish well in 
an up-and-down season. While 
the future is surely bright with 
the young team in their first 
year on the Division I scene, this program certainly wants to 
send the seniors off with a bang. 
UCSD (10–20, 7–12 Big West) 
faced off against an experienced 
and talented California State 
University, Bakersfield team 
(18–9, 11–8 Big West) and took them to the very end. Despite 
playing hard, the Tritons 
couldn’t get the win, losing in five sets: 25–19, 19–25, 25–21, 
15–25, and 15–13. 
This match started off with 
good energy from both sides, 
with the will to win obvious in 
the effort the teams were putting 
in early. Senior setter Isabela Dobra was controlling the game 
and keeping the Tritons in their 
system, and set 4 of the first 5 
points for the Tritons, knotting 
the first game at 5. The nerves 
for UCSD showed though, with 
a big run coming from CSUB to hand the Tritons an almost 
insurmountable 12–5 deficit; 
the response would be crucial 
in determining the rest of this match for the Tritons. 
They answered by scoring 5 
of the next 7 points, highlighted 
by 2 straight points set by senior 
libero Susanna Limb and killed 
by freshman outside hitter Zaria 
Henderson, to put the score 
at a manageable 14–10. A kill 
from senior opposite Trinity 
Castañeda, one of her season-high 17, put the Tritons within 5 
again, but the Tritons didn’t get 
within 4 again and dropped the set by a score of 25–19. 
The Tritons were not done 
yet, and it showed as the start of the second set seemed especially competitive. Each team went 
back and forth, with 5 ties, 
until the Tritons scored 3 in a 
row to give them an 8–6 lead, 
highlighted by two pristine sets 
by Dobra to Henderson and 
Castañeda. With the offense starting to look crisper, the 
team was getting in rhythm. 
The Tritons regained the 
lead with two points from a 
dominant-looking Henderson, and Dobra followed it up with 
a service ace that truly shifted 
the momentum squarely to the 
Tritons’ side. 
With the set nearing its 
end and the score tight, the 
Tritons pulled off a clutch 4–0 
run, giving them a 22–18 lead 
after sophomore outside hitter Ava McInnes punctuated the 
run with an impressive kill. McInnes’ service ace soon after awarded the Tritons the set at 
25–19.
Another of McInnes’ four 
service aces of the game gave the Tritons a 9–4 lead, and the 
Tritons were now taking control 
of the match. Still, CSUB didn’t 
go away and kept the set close 
until the end. UCSD eventually relinquished the lead, and 
uncharacteristic attack and 
service errors clinched the third set at 25–21 for CSUB. 
While disappointed, just as 
before UCSD came out inspired and took an 8–3 lead, once again ending with a McInnes 
ace. A set from junior libero 
Naya Dong to McInnes made 
the advantage 15–10, and the 
Tritons were looking to force a 
deciding set. Limb starred in a 
5–0 run, making her presence known all over the court with 
great bumps keeping the offense 
together, and propelling the 
Tritons to a commanding 21–13 
lead. McInnes’ last service ace gave the Tritons a 4–0 run, and 
also gave the Tritons the fourth 
set by a score of 25–15.
A kill from the dependable 
senior Castañeda started the 
Tritons off up 3–1, hoping to 
eke out a tough victory against 
their formidable opponent in a 
deciding fifth set. Similarly to before, the lead changed hands 
over and over again, with many ties. A kill by McInnes once again tied the game at 11, and 
the game would come down to a few final points with both teams 
looking to give everything they 
had to will their way to victory. 
Bakersfield scored 2 in a 
row, but McInnes responded 
with 2 kills of her own to knot 
the score at 13. But after a quick Bakersfield kill, McInnes had a 
shot blocked to end the game in 
the Roadrunners’ favor, 15–13, but the Triton team certainly gave the game their all and had 
many impressive moments in 
what was a heart-wrenching 
loss. McInnes led the Tritons 
with 23 kills and 4 aces, and Castañeda and Henderson weren’t far behind with 17 and 
14 kills, respectively. Dobra had her second-best assist tally of 
the season with 60, while Dong 
had her second-best dig total 
with 26. 
The Tritons played their 
last game of the season the 
night after, a straight-set loss to California State University, 
Fullerton, and due to NCAA 
classification rules, will not be eligible for the postseason. This team has a promising future 
with all their young stars, and 
they will look to improve in their second season in Division 
I in 2022.Donovan Perez-Schipper
