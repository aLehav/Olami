Federal Judge Blocks 
Applications for Biden’s 
Student Loan Forgiveness 
Program
By NIKITA CARDOZO
/gid00020/gid00006/gid00015/gid00010/gid00016/gid00019/gid00001/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019STUDENT LOANS
Two federal courts struck 
down the Biden administration’s 
federal student loan forgiveness 
program, halting any new appli -
cations from being submitted.
Applicants are currently met 
with the following message on 
StudentAid.gov: “Courts have is -
sued orders blocking our student 
debt relief program. As a result, 
at this time, we are not accepting 
applications. We are seeking to 
overturn those orders. If you’ve 
already applied, we’ll hold your 
applications.”
For many students at UC San 
Diego, this decision could make it 
much harder for them to pay oﬀ  
their student loans. As of 2022, 
almost 43 million borrowers have 
federal student loan debt, and the 
average debt is $37,787. Each year, 
almost 40% of all undergraduate 
students take out student loans; 
70% of students have accumulat -
ed student debt by the time they 
graduate. 
/T_he program was halted soon 
a/f_ter Judge Mark Pittman of the 
U.S. District Court for the North -
ern District of Texas rejected 
President Joseph Biden’s execu -
tive action in August to cancel 
up to $20,000 in student debt for 
millions of Americans. Pittman 
was appointed in 2019 by former 
President Donald Trump. 
Pittman is not the only con -
servative to knock down Biden’s 
plan. /T_he Job Creators Network 
Foundation, a conservative ad -
vocacy group, called the plan “ir -
rational, arbitrary, and unfair.” 
Moreover, they accused the presi -
dent of overreaching his authority 
and argued that the White House 
overlooked federal procedures by 
not getting public input on the 
program. 
/T_he Biden Administration 
said that the Justice Department 
has already appealed the fed -
eral court’s decision. Education 
Secretary Miguel Cardona said 
that “we believe strongly that the 
Biden-Harris Student Debt Re -
lief Plan is lawful and necessary 
to give borrowers and working 
families breathing room as they 
recover from the pandemic and to 
ensure they succeed when repay -
ment restarts.”
/T_he Education Department 
claimed that borrowers would 
receive forgiveness of their loan 
within six weeks a/f_ter they ap -
plied. /T_he application launched 
on Oct. 17 and more than 26 UAW STRIKE
UAW Academic Workers March in the First Week of 
UC-Wide Strike
By TIANRUI HUANG /gid00020/gid00006/gid00015/gid00010/gid00016/gid00019/gid00001/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
The multi-unit UAW strike, which started last 
Monday, has lasted a week across 10 UC cam -
puses and the Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory. Tens of thousands of academic workers 
shut down their classrooms and research labs, form -
ing picket lines and marching through the campus, 
in demand of fair contracts. /T_his is the largest strike 
at any academic institution in history, and the /f_irst 
time ever that postdoctoral scholars and academic 
researchers have gone on strike.
/T_he strike has received widespread support from 
undergraduate students, faculty, and college com -
munities. /T_he California Federation of Labor, which 
represents more than 2.1 million workers statewide, 
expressed support for the strike as well.
“/T_he strike in UC today demonstrates the gen -
eral exploitation of academic workers around the 
world, which wasn’t widely discussed in mainstream 
media,” Earl Warren College senior Zerui Pan, who 
signed up for the picket lines and attended the speech 
series, said. 
“/T_he strike voices out the immediate need to fur -
ther reform our current education system and that’s 
why I chose to respect the picket line,” Pan said.
Second-year doctorate student Jasmine Browne, a 
strike captain at the John Muir College picket line, 
stated, “I’ve seen a lot of support from undergraduate 
students, which honestly surprised me. /T_here were 
students just coming up and asking questions like 
what was going on with the strike. /T_he responses I’ve 
seen are pretty supportive.” 
According to Browne, some undergraduate stu -
dents even brought snacks and water to the strikers 
at the picket line.
Faculty from various departments have stated 
their support for the strike, with some professors 
even canceling classes and joining strikers at the 
picket lines
Nevertheless, not all departments have displayed 
positive attitudes. /T_he UCSD Guardian learned that 
some academic workers faced pressure from their de -
partments or faculties against striking.
In the email sent out by Jerry Yang, the Vice 
Chair for Graduate Education, the chemistry de -
partment emphasized that “all courses are currently 
planned to continue as originally scheduled, and the 
expectations for attendance, participation … has not 
changed,” even though the department acknowl -
edged the choices that every graduate student has in 
participating in the strike or not, and that “[students] 
are legally protected from harassment or retaliation 
for [their] choices in this matter.” 
According to fourth-year doctorate chemis -
try student Conor Herin, an Unfair Labor Practice 
charge was /f_iled in the department as “Union Intimi -
dation,” as the university was unlawfully deterring 
and discouraging union activity. /T_hree additional ULP charges against UC were /f_iled, including unlaw -
ful interference in the bargaining process and direct 
surveying of bargaining-unit members.
“/T_here are a lot of half-measures taken,” sixth-
year doctorate student Maximilian Bernbeck said. 
“A lot of verbals show support in standing by the 
students, but in actual speaking they’re entirely op -
posite. /T_hey can say in the same breath that ‘we sup -
port you’ and ‘don’t do this or we’ll take away your 
academic success.”
Numerous graduate students in the chemistry 
department have still carried out their Teaching As -
sistant duties and held discussion sessions as usual 
during the strike period. 
However, the strike has also /f_ielded some com -
plaints.
An anonymous Roger Revelle College senior 
shared her unpleasant experience on the /f_irst day 
of the strike with /T_he Guardian. When she walked 
across the Peterson Loop to get to her class, she was 
yelled at by some strikers near the Ridge Walk Aca -
demic Complex that “you don’t have to go to classes 
but we need to eat.” 
Despite the student being late for class, one striker 
came up, stopped her, and asked her to sign the peti -
tion, telling her, “it’s OK. You can tell your professor 
we stopped you.”
“I didn’t know we couldn’t cross the picket line 
that time,” the student said. “I was confused. I didn’t 
stop them from striking but why did they yell at me 
and stop me from going to class?”
As of the time of this article, UAW and UC haven’t 
reached an agreement on the wage adjustment issue. 
For the economic proposals, UC /f_irst oﬀered a $132/
month increase in student researchers’ wages, which 
would still leave entry-level SRs paying an average of 
56% of their income on rent. UAW called this an “in -
sulting contract.” Later, UC agreed to give an addi -
tional 4.5% raises to Academic Researchers; however, 
this still does not match the rate of in/f_lation.
Despite the sluggishness of wage negotiations, 
progress has been made. According to the latest bar -
gaining update, UAW and UC have agreed upon im -
portant issues such as parking and transit, appoint -
ment noti/f_ication, paid time oﬀ, and health bene/f_its 
improvements for postdocs. As the UC ULP Strike 
Newsletter commented, “these proposals re/f_lect 
Academic Workers’ priorities to receive more transit 
bene/f_its and better job security.”
/T_he Guardian reached out to the Graduate and 
Postdoctoral Aﬀairs Team and sociology faculty for 
an oﬃcial response and expert comment, respective -
ly, but none of them gave a statement.

2022 academic workers’ strike. Please visit Fair UC

million people applied within 
three weeks. Currently, 16 mil -
lion of those requests have been 
approved. /T_he department said it 
will hold the applications of bor -
rowers who have already applied. 
Finding a plaintiﬀ who can 
prove they have been harmed by 
the policy is the main obstacle for 
those who oppose Biden’s plan. 
Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law 
professor, said he was shocked by 
the Texas judge’s ruling. While UC San Diego has 
adapted to the ever-changing CO -
VID-19 situation and has made 
plans to li/f_t many of its mandato -
ry masking guidelines by Dec. 16, 
scientists are still learning about 
the lasting impact on those who 
have already contracted the virus. 
Despite the numerous known di -
verse neurological symptoms as -
sociated with long COVID, the 
pathology of these debilitating 
conditions have remained un -
clear. Researchers at the UCSD 
School of Medicine and Sanford 
Consortium led an international 
team of researchers to investi -
gate the eﬀect of SARS-CoV-2 on 
brain cortical organoids.
Post-COVID conditions, or 
more commonly known as long 
COVID, is de/f_ined by the Center 
for Disease Control and Preven -
tion  as the phenomenon where 
individuals “infected with the 
virus that causes COVID-19 … 
experience long-term eﬀects from 
their infection.” Some of the long-
term neurological eﬀects include 
diﬃculty concentrating or think -
ing, loss of smell or taste, depres -
sion, and anxiety.
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that 
causes COVID-19, is not only able 
to infect brain organoids, but also 
proliferate within them. Speci/f_i -
cally, researchers have found that SARS-CoV-2 viral levels peak at 
48 hours post-infection, before 
declining over the remaining 
course of infection. /T_his SARS-
CoV-2 infection and replication 
in brain organoids is additionally 
associated with a loss of excitato -
ry synapses in the neurons, and 
results in neuronal cell death.
A/f_ter establishing that SARS-
CoV-2 promotes neuronal death 
in brain organoids, the research -
ers were curious if Sofosbuvir, a 
U.S. Food and Drug Administra -
tion-approved antiviral drug that 
is already used to treat Hepatitis 
C, would be able to mitigate some 
of these eﬀects. Sofosbuvir has 
previously been shown to sup -
press other structurally similar viruses, such as coronaviridae. 
/T_he researchers found that So -
fosbuvir is able to inhibit SARS-
CoV-2 replication. Furthermore, 
they identi/f_ied an appropriate 
dose of Sofosbuvir that would al -
low for the maximum inhibition 
of SARS-CoV-2 without inducing 
any cell death.
In a press release, senior study 
author and Professor in the de -
partment of pediatrics, and cellu -
lar and molecular medicine, at the 
UC San Diego School of Medicine 
Alysson R. Muotri  spoke about 
the signi/f_icance of her team’s re -
sults in the clinical landscape of 
COVID-19. 
“Vaccines and emerging treat -
ments have reduced the health consequences of COVID-19 in 
most patients,” Muotri explained. 
“But the phenomenon of Long 
COVID, characterized by persist -
ing symptoms that include neu -
rological impairment, remains 
poorly understood and without 
any speci/f_ic remedy.”
She continued to explain how 
their /f_indings on Sofosbuvir po -
tentially has far-reaching impacts 
for patient outcomes. 
“/T_he bottom line is that So -
fosbuvir appears to have the 
potential to arrest or prevent 
the development of neurologi -
cal symptoms in COVID-19 
patients,” Muotri said. “And be -
cause it has been shown to present 
no safety concerns in pregnant 
women, it might also be an op -
tion for preventing SARS-CoV-2 
transmission to their unborn 
children.”
However, Muotri notes that 
much work still needs to be done, 
in order for her team’s /f_indings to 
be safely applied in a clinical set -
ting.
“Further studies and clini -
cal trials are needed, of course, 
but these /f_indings oﬀer a path 
forward for treating a condition 
(Long COVID) that has so far 
stymied remedy for millions of 
people worldwide,” Muotri said.

On Aug. 24, President Biden 
announced that tens of millions 
of Americans would be eligible 
for student loan forgiveness — up 
to $20,000 if they received a Pell 
Grant and up to $10,000 if they 
didn’t. 
/T_he student loan forgiveness 
plan was already on hold from 
a challenge brought up by six 
Republican-led states that also 
accused the president of over -
stepping his authority. How -
ever, a federal judge rejected the states’ lawsuits, claiming that 
they lacked legal standing. /T_he 
states didn’t give up the lawsuit 
and instead, /f_iled an appeal and 
asked the court to stay with the 
president’s plan. /T_he 8th U.S. Cir -
cuit Court of Appeals granted the 
states’ emergency petition, which 
stopped the Biden administration 
from being able to forgive any 
student debt. Still, the Depart -
ment of Education encouraged 
borrowers to continue applying 
since the plan had not been struck down yet. 
Republicans had criticized 
student loan forgiveness as a 
handout to well-oﬀ college gradu -
ates long before Biden introduced 
his plan. /T_hey also stated that the 
president didn’t have the power 
to forgive consumer debt without 
Congress. So far, at least 6 law -
suits have been brought against 
the president’s plan.

A.S. Week 7 and 8: EDI, Access Codes, and SPACES Budgets
By Kaitlin Lee
/gid00015/gid00006/gid00024/gid00020/gid00001/gid00006/gid00005/gid00010/gid00021/gid00016/gid00019/gid00010/gid00002/gid00013/gid00001/gid00002/gid00020/gid00020/gid00010/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00015/gid00021
Week 7
/T_his week, the Associated 
Students mainly focused on the 
proposition of homework and 
textbook access code initiative 
introduced by Oﬃce of Equity, 
Diversity, and Inclusion led by 
Assistant Vice President Cris -
tian Fuentes-Hernandez, as well 
as going over the UAW graduate 
student workers strike. 
First, Fuentes-Hernandez 
gave a special presentation on 
the homework and textbook code 
initiative his oﬃce hopes to intro -
duce. Although homework codes, 
as they are now, make it easy 
for instructors to grade assign -
ments, Fuentes-Hernandez stated 
it brings up issues of accessibil -
ity for students. Codes can range 
from $65 to $100, and are only ac -
cessible for one quarter and one 
class. Additionally, online home -
work and textbooks can be inac -
cessible to students with disabili -
ties, such as blind students. 
“It’s an issue of equity,” Fuen -
tes-Hernandez said. “It may be 
$60, but that money can aﬀect 
people depending on their cir -
cumstances. If you’re struggling 
with housing, you live paycheck-
by-paycheck, and you’re on /f_inan -
cial aid, this $60 can be another 
thing that can hinder your educa -
tion.” 
To further investigate, the of -
/f_ice of EDI met with the academic 
senate, and the senate then did 
surveys with the help from In -
stitutional Research, Student Af -
fairs, the Library, Provosts, A.S., CALPIRG, and Students for Open 
Access. /T_hey found /f_ive results 
from the surveys:
1. Diﬀerent student demo -
graphic groups experience diﬀer -
ent impacts with regards to access 
with course materials.
2. /T_he cost of homework codes 
are a signi/f_icant barrier.
3. Students are frustrated be -
ing asked to buy materials that 
they barely use.
4. Students prefer ownership 
and reusing materials.
5. Material costs outside of tu -
ition are seen as a /f_inancial bur -
den.
Following this, President Sky 
Yang stated that incoming stu -
dents will need to con/f_irm their 
COVID-19 vaccination status on 
MyStudentChart by Jan. 3, 2023. Next, Academic Aﬀairs Vice 
President Rhianen Callahan ex -
pressed support for the academic 
workers strike as well as reshared 
graphics from the unions on the 
AS academic Instagram page. 
Finally, Fuentes-Hernandez 
introduced the resolution to pres -
sure the academic senate about 
homework codes. /T_he majority 
of the A.S. members agreed that 
they shared some sort of displea -
sure over homework codes, but 
many were not sure how to imple -
ment some sort of change. One 
of the main dissenters was Cal -
lahan, who noted that there are 
many barriers to go through, such 
as diﬀerent approvals from diﬀer -
ent assemblies. 
Week 8 
At the A.S. meeting in Week 8, students from SPACES went over 
their new budget for the academic 
year, and a senator introduced 
a new initiative for battery recy -
cling and disposal. 
During the Open Floor, stu -
dents from the general audience 
came in to discuss the strike and 
the rami/f_ications of what could 
come. A student from Eleanor 
Roosevelt College, whose name 
was not recorded, explained their 
worries for how there might be 
a possible attempt from UC San 
Diego to raise undergraduate 
tuition, even though the under -
graduate stability plan, a plan 
meant to prevent rises in tuition, 
is in place. /T_he student asked A.S. 
to pay attention to the price of tu -
ition and ensure that it remains 
fair and aﬀordable. Additionally, 
another student told the A.S. to 
not make performative actions to 
address the needs of the current 
strikers. 
Next, members of the assem -
bly board at SPACES gave a pre -
sentation on the 2022-23 budget. 
/T_he presenters were Director of 
External Aﬀairs Kaelyn Ford, 
Co-Director of Internal Aﬀairs 
Rara Watanabe, and SIPHR Co-
Director Teanna Bautista-Leung. 
SPACES was aﬀorded to make 
changes in the budget thanks to 
a rollover fund total of $85,000, 
allowing them a larger budget. 
First, SPACES raised the wages 
of its workers to combat the ris -
ing costs of living. Additionally, 
the presenters went over the total 
allocations for its components. 
SPICEE will receive $60,000; 
SIPHR will receive $80,000, and 
SIAPS will receive $184,000. 
Following the budget review, 
Senator Divya Gangaramani 
sponsored a special presentation 
on electronic waste disposal on 
campus. Currently, on-campus 
battery disposal is done through 
mail only. However, this initiative 
seeks to recycle batteries, which 
can enable the recovery of use -
ful materials like copper or gold, 
and reduce the energy required to 
mine them and thus reduce pollu -
tion and greenhouse gasses. 
A.S. Council meetings take 
place at 6 p.m. every Wednesday 
and are open to students. Stu -
dents can participate in these 
meetings by attending live at the 
A.S. oﬃces in Price Center, join -
ing their Zoom link, or tuning in 
on Facebook Live.

Sparky mitra
 During the month of Novem -
ber, I began to hear rumblings of 
an academic strike by our gradu -
ate student workers. By the sec -
ond week of the month, the ru -
mors were con/f_irmed: a strike was 
impending, and many of our TAs 
would soon become inaccessible. 
Our TAs, researchers, and oth -
er academic workers in the UAW 
have collectively decided to with -
hold their labor in order to take 
a stand against the UC’s unfair 
labor practices and compel those 
in charge to adopt fair labor prac -
tices. /T_hey have directed the pub -
lic’s attention toward the fact that 
the contracts, wages, and present 
salary oﬀered to graduate work -
ers have le/f_t many struggling to 
make ends meet, with the cost of 
living and rent continuing to in -
crease while their incomes remain 
stagnant. Many academic workers 
have been forced to work multiple 
jobs while balancing teaching, re -
search, their personal lives, and 
their /f_inancial burdens. 
Admittedly, I, like many other 
undergraduate students, experi -
enced feelings of sympathy for our 
academic workers but also a sense 
of detachment from the issue. 
Because it wasn’t something that 
directly aﬀects us, it was easier to 
ignore. I also think many of us ei -
ther assumed a settlement would 
be reached before a strike could 
materialize, or we anticipated a 
short-lived strike and a couple of 
days oﬀ from class. /T_hus, for many 
undergraduate students, this was 
a matter to approach with impas -
sivity or ignorance — to wait for 
it to blow over until  things would By EMILY ITO

eventually return to normal. 
However, over the course of 
this past week, UC San Diego has 
transformed from a silent dead 
zone to a lively hotbed. Every -
where you turn, there are indi -
cators of the academic workers’ 
strike permeating our campus; it’s 
nearly impossible to miss the vari -
ous displays of protest. Whether 
it’s the countless “STRIKE” signs 
strung up on buildings, the large 
groups of picketers chanting in 
front of lecture halls, or even the 
cancellation of weekly sections, 
the reality of this strike is some -
thing that we as Tritons can nei -
ther avoid or ignore. /T_his strike has brought to light 
the integral role that our academic 
workers play in UC institutions. 
/T_hey are fundamental for grad -
ing, teaching, research, and more. 
/T_heir contributions are irreplace -
able and incalculable, illustrating 
the absurdity of how little they 
are compensated for their work. 
I think I speak for the majority of 
undergraduates when I say that we 
miss our TAs, that we’ve discov -
ered a newfound appreciation for 
them, and that many of us want to 
support them. 
But, I also acknowledge that 
we, as undergraduates, /f_ind our -
selves in a diﬃcult position. While we feel supportive and angry, we 
are still putting thousands of dol -
lars toward our education. Many 
of us are still being held respon -
sible for deadlines, lecture at -
tendance, and exams. Some of us 
have to cross the picket line and 
attend classes. Some of us have no 
choice but to continue. 
Fortunately, I have professors 
who understand and are support -
ive of me joining the picket, even 
if it means missing class. However, 
I also recognize that this is not a 
luxury that every student has been 
aﬀorded. 
/T_herefore, the plea I make to 
my fellow undergraduates is one that does not set the expectation 
that participation must be done in 
a speci/f_ic way. What I ask is that 
we take this strike by our aca -
demic workers as an opportunity 
for enlightenment. I don’t want to 
tell you what stance to take on this 
or that you should be out picket -
ing and supporting. What I want 
is for you to take some time to 
understand what these pickets are 
about, to become informed on the 
gravity of our academic workers’ 
plight, to recognize the unavoid -
able impact that this movement 
has on us as fellow UC students, 
and to realize that indiﬀerence is 
complacency. 
For those in disagreement with 
the methods of our workers’ direct 
action or feeling angry by the in -
convenience of this strike, remem -
ber to take the time to become 
informed. Do not take a stance 
of anger toward the distractions 
without also familiarizing your -
self with the reason for that very 
disruption. Proceed with compas -
sion, open-mindedness, and an 
understanding that these demon -
strations and the impact they have 
on us are fueled by the rage of an 
exploited population. A system 
cannot improve without reform -
ing the structures it rests upon. 
Please heed my advice and 
learn more about what is happen -
ing behind the scenes of our class -
es and our research. Recognize the 
individuals that our school so des -
perately relies on. Decide how you 
wish to proceed in these coming 
weeks; determine where you stand 
and what you can do to support 
the strike. Academic Strike and
A Call to My Undergrads
I recently volunteered at a 
preschool event. It was a festival, 
and I was put in charge of a 
ring toss game stall. The teacher 
told me to be lenient with the 
kids and that as long as the ring 
touched the prize, they could 
have it. The prizes looked like 
cheap dollar store items and 
there were two full tubs of them.
It was my first time dealing 
with toddlers in a long time. I 
had no idea how much I could 
reason with them. Many walked 
past the line they were supposed 
to throw from. Some didn’t seem 
to understand the concept of 
throwing. One memorable girl 
walked straight up to the prize 
she wanted and dropped the ring 
from right on top.
And then there were the 
parents to deal with. Some of 
them made their kids follow the 
rules and stand behind the line. 
But others would tell me their 
kid wanted this and that and 
asked me to put it in an easy 
place for their kid to get. I, as just 
a volunteer, didn’t want to argue, 
so I let the parents have their way 
with their kids.
But that made me wonder 
about the way kids are brought 
up.
At the festival, I felt uneasy with two things I saw. First, 
was the materialist culture that 
was already being ingrained 
in these kids. Most of them 
seemed more interested in the 
cheap dollar store prizes than 
the challenge of the ring toss. 
This, for sure, I am against. 
Second, was the gendering that 
was going on. Another volunteer 
at the ring toss stall would 
bring out traditionally feminine 
objects like pink tea sets when 
a girl came and traditionally 
masculine objects like swords 
when a boy came. I did not feel 
good about this, but I felt unsure 
about it at the same time. Does 
this mean I should’ve offered 
the girl the sword and the boy 
the tea set, just offer the sword, 
just offer the tea set, be neutral, 
or base my decision on some 
other trait of the child other than 
perceived gender?
The fact that I am unsure 
about how to treat toddlers 
concerns me because it reveals 
how I barely have any contact 
with an entire demographic 
that is critically important to 
society’s future.
Education is important 
and vastly underrated in 
today’s society, especially early 
childhood education. Our 
understanding of their education 
should reflect this importance.
The sooner a child can ask 
questions, the more effectively By BEn LIOU
/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019that child can learn from the 
adults and older children 
surrounding them. The sooner 
a child learns to read, the more 
that child can teach themselves 
about all kinds of things 
in the world. Just like with 
compound interest, starting 
early matters. The advantages 
add up drastically. Despite some 
thinking that teens and young 
adults are too immature to start 
learning about early education, 
a head start is exactly what our 
world’s future needs.
Many of us, myself included, 
are college students without 
kids. Perhaps we may have them 
in a few years, or maybe not 
until another decade or two, or 
not at all. Many other people 
are already parents, or perhaps 
grandparents, or even great-
grandparents.
To the people without 
children: Have you ever stopped 
and thought of how you would 
raise a kid if you ever held that 
responsibility?
To the people already with 
kids: You’ve probably reflected 
a lot already. But how often have 
you gotten overwhelmed or 
consumed by daily tasks that you 
forgot the importance of raising 
a child, along with the pride and 
accomplishment of doing so?
I think it is never too early 
nor too late to think about how to 
raise children, given how critical the task of educating the future 
generation is. Many people in 
my generation and those before 
call for addressing climate 
change and criticize the wasteful 
culture that generates pollution. 
Yet, how many of us notice the 
underlying cause of materialist 
and consumerist culture being 
silently passed on to the future 
generation? That there are kids 
being brought up in the culture 
of cheap plastic throwaway 
one-time satisfactions. Many 
people in my generation and 
those before call for gender 
equality. Yet, how many of us 
notice the gendering that kids 
are put through? That a dilemma 
actually exists in the seemingly 
simple question of giving a child 
a tea set or a sword, and that 
the decision may play a role in 
determining their future.It is Never Too Early Nor Late to Think of  How to Raise Kids
Education is the key to 
change. Change that lasts.
Thinking back, if I were the 
teacher or parent, I would’ve 
enforced the rules of the game 
and would’ve been less lenient: 
still two tickets to play, still three 
throws, but you only get the prize 
if you completely loop it in. But 
in exchange, I would’ve had a 
separate practice stall next door 
for kids to hone their skills for 
free, as many times as they want, 
before going up for the challenge. 
Thus, kids learn the importance 
of practice and preparation while 
sharpening their motor skills, 
learn to cope with losing and 
learning from mistakes, and rise 
to the challenge and gain a true 
feeling of accomplishment with a 
befitting reward.
How would you have done it?

I’ll Be Home for Friendsgiving
By Rosabella DebtY
/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
Turkey Day is an underrated 
holiday. Sandwiched between Hal -
loween and Christmas, it gets the 
rap of the middle child. But, even 
with its abysmal history, there is 
something special about being 
with loved ones for this holiday 
and the idea of being thankful for 
the moment you are in. /T_his isn’t 
to say everyone’s /T_hanksgiving 
goes swimmingly —look at Chan -
dler from “Friends. ” At college, 
however, the air ripens with the 
opportunity to make something 
special. I’m an out-of-state stu -
dent, so for the past three years, I 
haven’t been able to go home for 
/T_hanksgiving. /T_his saddened me 
at /f_irst, but then I realized, I need 
to make it mine. /T_his transfers 
to the (maybe overused) term: 
Friendsgiving.
Honestly, I like Friendsgiving 
more than /T_hanksgiving. Family 
relationships can be hard during 
the holidays, and there’s always 
some high-stress situation that 
occurs when relatives are in town. 
Y ou’re around people you may not 
want to see — snotty-nosed kids 
that have never heard of washing 
their hands, and that one aunt that 
airs out the town’s dirty laundry 
unprompted. At Friendsgiving, 
you get to choose who you spend 
your time with. I feel like this is 
especially important for college, 
where watching the bustling cam -
pus turn into a ghost town makes 
the four day weekend feel all the 
more alone. I’m fortunate to know 
people who stayed every year, 
strengthening friendships in our 
shared inability to leave. I’ll ad -
mit, I worried my /f_irst year that I 
would spend every /T_hanksgiving 
alone, watching Instagram stories 
and TikToks from communities 
cherishing their time together. 
For me, I believe the ability to 
share a hot meal with people from 
all walks of life brings gratitude in 
a way I had never experienced be -
fore college.
Another plus of Friendsgiving 
is learning the diﬀerent staples 
at the turkey table based on how 
and where you grew up. I’m from 
the South, so there’s a lot of soul 
food that I was surprised didn’t 
exist here in California (or at least, 
in San Diego) — sweet potato 
pie, turkeys that aren’t drier than 
a Popeyes biscuit, red-skinned 
mashed potatoes, and more. But 
some new additions that I’ve now found I love are pumpkin rolls, 
salads with cranberries and wal -
nuts, spring rolls, and more! And, 
now that I am 21, I get to indulge 
in the warm apple ciders and san -
grias that I had always smelled be -
fore but couldn’t taste.
Friendsgiving taught me that 
going home for the holidays 
doesn’t necessarily mean leav -
ing campus. Home can be your 
friend’s dorm, and it can be what -
ever dining hall is open, serving 
/T_hanksgiving dinner all day. It can 
be binging that one show you had 
to put oﬀ because homework has 
a deadline and “House of Dragon” doesn’t. Y ou can have multiple 
“homes” you go to, with diﬀerent 
people associated with each. 
Y es, I believe /T_hanksgiving is 
an underrated holiday. I believe 
as time goes on, fewer and fewer 
people care about it. I can’t say 
if this is because we, as a people, 
have become more closed oﬀ, or 
simply because of the commer -
cialization of the other holidays 
that sandwich it. Its ironic origin 
of slaughtering the people who are 
given ‘thanks’  also shrouds a dark 
cloud over the celebration,  which 
we cannot disregard no matter 
how much we like the cranberry sauce. My hope, though, is that 
our generation is creating a new 
/T_hanksgiving – one we are actu -
ally thankful for and don’t feel ob -
ligated to attend, where we share 
meals with those we choose, not 
those chosen for us. And that, 
when we sit around the table, with 
the cornucopia  of our history and 
our culture in front of us, what we 
are grateful for won’t be a question 
we ponder.
What are you grateful for this 
Friendsgiving?
A/f_ter taking my math mid -
term, I realized that my GPA may 
have taken a severe beating, so I 
needed to take a generous break to 
destress. Being a Y elp a/f_icionado 
and foodie fanatic, I decided to opt 
for a nice meal out. A/f_ter scrolling 
through Y elp all during class  —I 
am not an academic weapon, sad -
ly —and taking into consideration 
that my friend had developed in -
tense munchies for Asian food, I 
settled upon Chiko, a Chinese-
Korean fusion restaurant based in 
Encinitas, California. 
My friend and I bussed our -
selves an hour up north. We 
missed two stops along the way 
because I accidentally fell asleep 
due to my atrocious sleep sched -
ule, but we eventually found the 
place — albeit 15 minutes behind 
schedule. It is located in a small 
spot next to the side of a busy 
street. Both the exterior and in -
terior were well-designed, featur -
ing heavy use of wooden elements 
and a distinctive black and yel -
low color combination. We were 
directed to order online, and we 
opted for the spicy ribeye and rice 
cakes ($19), pork and kimchi pot -
stickers ($10), and the galbi beef 
skewers ($12). Unfortunately, the 
estimated wait was a shocking 40 
minutes. Oddly enough, I saw very 
few customers (mostly pickup or -
ders), and several staﬀ members 
lounging around which begs the 
question: Why was the wait that 
long? Despite the slight nuisance, 
time /f_lew by as I browsed through my Instagram feed, engrossed by 
Y e’s latest shenanigans. 
I guess the staﬀ didn’t under -
stand that we were eating in the 
store because they presented our 
food in plastic containers and 
drab brown bags. I would have 
loved to give an honest critique 
of the presentation, but that was 
clearly not possible here. A/f_ter 
forcing my friend to wait for me to 
take my foodie pics, we dove into 
the skewers /f_irst. /T_he skewers were extremely 
/f_lavorful with the marinade hav -
ing worked its magic. /T_he short 
ribs featured a heavy soy sauce 
component, accentuated with 
hints of sweetness. While the meat 
was easy to chew, it could have 
been more moist. Additionally, 
it came with a savory gochujang 
sauce with a slow-creeping but en -
joyable heat. Paired together, the 
combination was truly an umami 
bomb to remember. Next up were the potstickers, 
easily the worst of the three dishes 
we ordered. /T_he pork /f_illing was 
quite good; although, once again, 
slightly dry. While the skin was 
crispy, it was unbelievably thick, 
throwing oﬀ the golden dough-
to-meat ratio. Additionally, they 
decided to dress up the dish with 
a pile of bright green scallions 
and a smattering of apple kimchi. 
Frankly, I was unimpressed. /T_heir 
approach felt extremely forced, adding something completely un -
necessary like apple kimchi in or -
der to achieve that “modern /f_lair. ” 
/T_he apple kimchi was also mushy 
and quite bland, oﬀering nothing 
toward the textural or /f_lavor pro -
/f_ile.
We ended oﬀ with the spicy ri -
beye and rice cakes — my favorite 
dish. It was composed of perfectly 
cooked tteok (Korean rice cake), 
sweet caramelized onions, a hand -
ful of cremini mushrooms, and 
bite-sized chunks of bulgogi rib -
eye. All of these components were 
bathed in a /f_iery broth, creating 
a cohesive and mouth-watering 
dish. While I have nothing but 
praise, I do think it’s a bit spicy as 
I was already tearing up midway 
through.
Overall, I give Chiko a 6/10. I 
like their idea of fusing diﬀerent 
cultures and playing with experi -
mental techniques, but their exe -
cution was oﬀ. Additionally, their 
prices were quite high, consider -
ing how little food we received. 
My friend and I weren’t even 
halfway full, and my tummy was 
making demonic noises in protest. 
I ended oﬀ my night by complet -
ing — or attempting to complete 
— my Mount Everest-sized pile of 
both late and not-late homework.

features@ucsdguardian.org     EUNICE KIM AND OISHEE MISRA  
On Nov. 14, the United Auto 
Workers Union began a UC-wide 
strike, demanding that the uni -
versity grant “fair compensation” 
to their academic workers, which 
includes aﬀordable child care, job 
security and more. 
/T_he UAW strikers have 
charged the UC system with un -
fair labor practices and have /f_iled 
against the UCs for not meeting 
their demands. /T_he UC, mean -
while, holds that their bargain -
ing oﬀers are fair compromises 
and insist that they have made no 
such infractions.
/T_he strike has manifested in 
many aspects of university life. 
UC San Diego sends out daily 
emails regarding the closure of 
Voigt Drive & Matthews Lane 
due to protest activity. Picket 
lines circle central areas of cam -
pus with protestors chanting into 
megaphones and bearing signs. 
And, of course, many classes and 
sections are canceled until the 
strike ends. 
Professors have sent out 
emails over the last week or so, 
announcing their contingency 
plans given the strike. /T_hough 
they vary in length and content, 
several professors have expressed 
concerns for their classes and stu -
dents, worried that the cancella -
tion of class sessions will impact 
student grades and diminish the 
quality or breadth of the course. 
On the other side, students 
have their own perspectives on 
the issue.
Sixth College junior Sydney 
Fredriksz said most of her classes 
have been canceled. 
“I do expect the university 
to drag this out to the detri -
ment of the workers on strike, as well as the students themselves,” 
Fredriksz said. “I plan to partici -
pate in the strike lines as o/f_ten as 
I am physically able to do so, to 
take up space and make noise to 
let the UC faculty know that the 
workers do not stand alone.”
Students had been looking to 
UCSD for an oﬃcial response, 
and it was delivered on Nov. 18. 
/T_he email encouraged students to 
focus on taking initiative of their 
learning and continuing their 
coursework in spite of the strike.
Brandy Youssif, a third year 
transfer student from John Muir 
College, shared her support for 
the strike.
“I think that the fact that the 
strike is legally protected is some -
thing that’s super important for 
student workers,” Youssif said, 
“because [otherwise] the admin -
istration would try to /f_ind their 
identities and try to push some 
kind of repercussion for that.”
In the dispute, however, it 
can be hard for students to navi -
gate where the “fault” lies for the length of the strike and the can -
cellation of classes. Lynne Zhao, 
sophomore from UCLA, com -
mented on the diﬃculty of the 
situation. 
“I’m in support of what they’re 
/f_ighting for and would like to see 
them achieve their goals,” Zhao 
said. “At the same time, it is also 
really unfortunate that a lot of 
people are caught in the middle of 
this all, and it’s disrupting a lot of 
people’s lives.”
Only a year ago, on Nov. 17, 
2021, 6500 UC lecturers won 
raises in exchange for calling oﬀ 
a two-day planned strike. It was 
the biggest win in UC-AFT strike 
history. /T_he UCs made special ef -
forts to prevent the strike due to 
how much of the student body 
would be impacted. 
/T_he current strike has far 
surpassed the planned two-day 
length of the 2021 lecturer strike, 
and students now face the impacts 
that the UCs carefully avoided in 
the past. 
/T_hough many students are sympathetic to the needs of the 
strikers, many still fear that they 
will be caught in the cross/f_ire. 
Elizabeth Paul, a sophomore at 
UC Davis, voiced some concerns 
regarding the strike.
“I’m concerned for the other 
students who have had classes 
and discussions canceled [and] 
that their grades will be impact -
ed,” Paul said. “/T_he only people 
who are at fault for what the TAs 
are complaining about are people 
in the administration. It isn’t fair 
if the students have to deal with 
consequences like tests never be -
ing graded or increased tuition.”
Many students feel as though 
they want to support the strik -
ers, but there is only so much that 
they can do without jeopardizing 
their own education. 
“I’m trying to not cross the 
picket line when I can avoid it, 
but am still attending things like 
oﬃce hours for the sake of my 
grades,” Zhao said, adding that 
some students are concerned 
about putting their scholarships Students Take a Stand on the UAW Strike

pating or experiencing side ef -
fects of the strike. 
Some students are also /f_ind -
ing it easy to disengage from the 
strike. Jonas Buchel, a sophomore 
at UC Davis, commented on this.
“I’m sure the right thing to do 
would be to get involved,” Buchel 
said. “But I don’t know enough 
about it, and it doesn’t impact me 
personally enough to make me 
super excited to learn more about 
it and participate.” 
Academic workers at UCSD 
— and all nine other UC cam -
puses — are undertaking a strike 
of historic proportions. 48,000 
strikers are pushing for change, 
making this the largest strike in 
the history of United States high -
er education. For better or worse, 
students are all becoming a part 
of academic history.
“I give the strikers all my 
hope, love, and support,” Fredrik -
sz said. “I give the university a 
middle /f_inger in the form of strike 
participation.”

San Diego Asian Film Festival Highlights
Opening by Hector Arrieta: My last experience with the San Diego Asian Film Festival 
was in 2020 during the pandemic when, unfortunately, the festival was moved to an online 
format. Flashforward to 2022, the A&E section was given the opportunity to provide cov -
erage of the event. I didn’t quite know what to expect given that this was my /f_irst festival 
experience post-pandemic, yet, to say this festival was great would be an understatement. 
SDAFF was better than I anticipated: from the venue, to the crowd, to the food, and how 
could I forget, the /f_ilms themselves, everything was amazing. /T_he section had a blast watch -
ing the collection of /f_ilms and now present our thoughts on each of the /f_ilms we watched.
“Bad Axe” 
By Fabian Garcia & Kamiah Johnson
To kick oﬀ /T_he San Diego Asian Film Festival, /T_he UCSD Guardian went to opening 
night to watch David Siev’s feature /f_ilm debut “Bad Axe,” a documentary about his very 
own family and a love letter to the Michigan town of the same name. 
One of the most striking things about the work is the crude authenticity of the Siev 
household. Such a raw and oﬀ-the-cuﬀ atmosphere could only really be achieved through 
the documentary medium which Siev commands eﬀortlessly. /T_he whole experience is so 
captivating that you almost feel like you are a part of the family as well. 
You get a clear sense of everyone’s personality, routines, and reactions. You seek com -
monalities and /f_ind yourself on the inside of jokes normally reserved for friends or fam -
ily. It’s one thing to suspend your disbelief for a character in a drama or an action /f_ilm, 
but it’s something diﬀerent to watch a real family interact and face hardship as a single 
unit. It’s a completely unique experience that you can only get from “Bad Axe.” Siev’s 
voice shines  throughout the documentary, clearly showing his love for both Bad Axe 
and his family. /T_he documentary shows what it is like to live in Bad Axe and what his 
family’s experience is like living in a largely republican town. By the end, Bad Axe feels 
like a character of its own. It’s easy to empathize with the challenges the Siev family faces 
during COVID-19 and the 2020 presidential election. 
A/f_ter the show, some of the Siev family, minus David himself, came out to answer 
questions from the audience. Rather than focusing on the /f_ilm, a lot of the audience was 
more focused on understanding the Siev family. In a way, the /f_ilm had done its job. It 
articulated a complex family dynamic de/f_ined by hardship and circumstance. Now, ev -
eryone was invested. /T_he Siev family’s story touched everyone, and many connected with 
their hardships and triumphs, making the Q&A portion that more special. /T_he Siev fam -
ily was incredibly gracious on and oﬀ stage, sharing behind the scene stories and heartfelt 
messages about loving one another. One of us was even lucky enough to get a photo with 
Chun Siev, David’s father.
/T_he love letter that started oﬀ as one to Bad Axe, ended up being a love letter to Da -
vid’s family. “Bad Axe” is an exceptional and intimate look into this family’s trials and 
tribulations that will leave a great impression on anyone who sees it. 
“Stellar: A Magical Ride”
By Erika Myong
A/f_ter hearing about “Stellar: A Magical Ride” /f_inally being released in Korean theaters 
earlier this year, it felt more than surreal for me to experience watching this movie here in 
San Diego. “Stellar: A Magical Ride” follows a chaotic and action-packed chase in which 
Young Bae (Son Ho Jun) must search for a supercar taken by his friend Dong Shik (Lee 
Kyu Hyung) — all while being hunted down by a gang led by Seo Sa Jang (Heo Sung Tae). 
Young Bae uses his late father’s old Stellar in a frantic attempt of escaping and search -
ing, but the car becomes more than just his getaway from his problems. He /f_inds himself 
reminiscing in the repressed memories of those with his father, a man he detested in the 
past but learns to /f_inally forgive and love. 
Like so many other Korean comedy /f_ilms, there seems to be an unspoken, hidden 
tradition within these movies that leave me crying out of sadness rather than laughter. 
It’s as if these directors who create comedic, funny movies actually enjoy making the au -
dience cry from the emotional impact they leave. With “Stellar,” the majority of the /f_ilm 
was /f_illed with the usual action-comedy scenes of gang /f_ights, crazy car chases, and the 
occasional surprises of a car somehow functioning on its own. What adds to this guilty 
pleasure of action /f_ilms is Seo Sa Jang’s charismatic demeanor as the gang boss, which 
is a slight contrast to his role as a dirty, ill-mannered gangster in his most famous work, 
“Squid Game.” 
Despite how surface-level the movie seems with these typical tropes, an underlying A&E Staff 
theme of loss and grief pulls at the audience’s heartstrings with the reveal of how Young 
Bae comes to terms with his father’s passing. Young Bae does not realize until the end 
how the janky, beat-up car has helped him all along — a /f_inal gi/f_t le/f_t from his father as a 
way to both thank and apologize to his son. /T_he reveal of how the car was magically run 
all along was a cheesy but wonderful ending for this /f_ilm to /f_inish on. “Stellar: A Magical 
Ride” serves as a heartwarming reminder of cherishing the people in our lives and how 
it’s never too late to say “thank you” and “I’m sorry.”
“/T_he Heroic Trio”
By Matthew Risley and Xuan Ly
Within the Classics Restored program at the San Diego Asian Film Festival, the 1993 
/f_ilm “/T_he Heroic Trio” was the most striking. Starring Anita Mui, Michelle Yeoh, and 
Maggie Cheung, the /f_ilm begins with a confounding case of baby snatching. Babies des -
tined to become emperors are stolen from the hospital by an invisible entity, bringing 
Wonder Woman (Anita Mui) and /T_hief Catcher (Maggie Cheung) to the rescue. Wonder 
Woman is the team’s moral compass, committed to /f_ighting evil from the beginning with 
her stylized throwing stars and /f_lashy rapier. /T_hief Catcher is a morally ambiguous gun 
for hire, who inexplicably joins the chase, taking out enemies with her sawed-oﬀ shotgun 
and corny quips. As the two toil to /f_ind the invisible entity, they encounter the Invisible 
Woman (Michelle Yeoh) who is working for the Evil Master, a seemingly all-powerful 
being who is keeping the babies captive underground to pick a new emperor for China. 
/T_he /f_ilm is /f_illed with diversely choreographed /f_ights between Wonder Woman, /T_hief 
Catcher, and the Invisible Woman. /T_he over-the-top action sequences never become stale 
and even border on comedy. In one of the more outlandish scenes, /T_hief Catcher throws a 
stick of dynamite into a barrel which she uses to /f_ly into the enemy’s base, where she dis -
patches her adversaries. /T_he /f_ight scenes between the three o/f_ten elicit dance-like move -
ments, indicating a connection between the trio that is yet to be explored. During a /f_ight 
between the three women, Wonder Woman and the Invisible Woman are le/f_t dangling 
hand-in-hand on a cliﬀside. As the Invisible Woman slips further, her arm aligns with 
Wonder Woman’s, revealing matching tattoos. /T_he pair stare at each other in revelation 
of their shared upbringing and long lost sisterhood. /T_his convinces the Invisible Woman 
to renounce the Evil Master and /f_ight alongside Wonder Woman and /T_hief Catcher, com -
pleting /T_he Heroic Trio. /T_he /f_ilm concludes with a /f_inal battle between the Evil Master 
and /T_he Heroic Trio. A/f_ter igniting dynamite on the Evil Master’s chest, the trio believes 
that the /f_ight is over. /T_hen, from beyond the /f_lames emerges the skinned corpse of the Evil 
Master. /T_he creature ensnares the Invisible Woman, acting as an exoskeleton to utilize 
her power against the rest of the trio. As all seems lost and the Evil Master compresses 
the Invisible Woman’s body with his own, she harkens back to her friendship with the 
Heroic Trio that pushed her to turn from evil. /T_he strength of her emotional bond proves 
incomprehensible for the Evil Master and her mind overpowers his. /T_he three don capes 
and walk triumphantly out of frame. 
“/T_he Heroic Trio” packs its short runtime to the brim with thoroughly mesmerizing 
moments. From the incredible action to the hilarious quips, it was one of the most enjoy -
able experiences we have had within a theater; anyone who has the opportunity to experi -
ence this /f_ilm undoubtedly should.
“Executioners” (1993)
By Arshia Singh
Not only did the San Diego Asian Film Festival oﬀer new releases for audiences to 
enjoy, but some classics in Asian cinema were also brought to the fest, including Johnnie 
To’s 1993 action-comedy “Executioners.” “Executioners” is  the second part to “/T_he He -
roic Trio,”  and follows the titular characters known as Wonder Woman (Anita Mui), the 
Invisible Woman (Michelle Yeoh), and /T_hief Catcher (Maggie Cheung) in their second 
adventure. Years following the events of the /f_irst /f_ilm, a nuclear attack on the city results 
in a water shortage, leading civilians to look for clean water in any place they can /f_ind, 
o/f_ten from /T_hief Catcher who steals from the company that withholds it. However, the 
company is being controlled by an evil villain who has goals to overthrow the govern -
ment and assassinate the President, and all three heroes must work together again to 
bring peace, and clean water, back to the city.
In continuing the epic saga of “/T_he Heroic Trio,” “Executioners” is set in a completely 
new world that is facing much turmoil in a time of public struggle. Wonder Woman has 
taken time to spend with her daughter, Cindy, while her husband Lau (Damian Lau) has

At the beginning of her career, 
Bea was opposed to collaboration. 
Everything up to and including 
her debut album were solo proj -
ects that she spent the majority 
of her time cra/f_ting herself. How -
ever, her 2021 EP, “Our Extended 
Play,” was birthed out of a col -
laboration with Matt Healy and 
George Daniel of /T_he 1975. Work -
ing alongside others, especially 
people like Healy, allowed her to 
/f_ind an appeal within collabora -
tion. She became more accepting 
of foreign ideas and appreciated 
the diﬀering perspectives others 
could give to her music; ultimate -
ly, “Beatopia” is an album that 
bene/f_its from this collaboration. 
Healy’s /f_ingerprints are found 
most notably within the album’s 
closer, “You’re Here /T_hat’s /T_he 
/T_hing,” and she credits him for 
much of “Pictures of Us.” “Be -
atopia” is marked by others too. 
Her guitarist Jacob Bugden was 
instrumental in writing the al -
bum and contributes vocals to the 
back-and-forth duet of “Don’t Get 
/T_he Deal.” Other voices include 
PinkPantheress, whose vocals 
take “Tinkerbell Is Overrated” to 
new heights and allow Bea to tap 
into her playful nature. While the 
collaboration behind “Beatopia” 
is a new development, the roots of 
the album go even further back.
“Beatopia” began as a fantasy 
world Bea created in her youth 
to keep her occupied in white-
dominated classrooms she felt 
alienated from as a Filipino im -
migrant. Bea even drew a map 
and vibrant illustrations to visu -alize Beatopia, but the illustra -
tions were taken by a teacher who 
used it as ammunition for her 
classmates to mock her. Beatopia 
disappeared a/f_ter that, and it was 
only when the COVID-19 lock -
down allowed for excessive time 
for self-discovery, that Bea began 
to piece together the fantasy word 
she once sketched. Of course, she 
can’t recall its intricacies, but the 
act of simply contemplating its 
creation and her past ridicule be -
came the creative breakthrough 
that inspired that project. It’s an 
album that conveys the heart of 
her old illustrations, paying trib -
ute to the inner child she is work -
ing on healing and stretching this 
compassion outward to lovers 
and family. 
Love has always been themati -
cally present within Bea’s work. 
/T_his might seem like an unneces -
sary observation in the sense that 
love in various forms is a com -
mon thread through most art, 
but it seems particularly true for 
Bea. Love songs are hyper present 
within her catalog — her album 
“Loveworm” nearly being an en -
tire collection of them — best ex -
empli/f_ied when her boyfriend at 
the time received two song titles 
to his name: “Soren” and “Horen 
Sarrison.” /T_hus, it seems /f_itting 
that “Beatopia’’ has a fair share 
of love songs, especially since one 
of its singles is titled “Lovesong.” 
/T_he song is one of the album’s 
highlights; with minimal guitar 
and her delicate voice, she chroni -
cles /f_leeting thoughts about a lov -
er that blend into every aspect of 
her life. While she excels at com -

In “Fairy Song,” 
she lists oﬀ reminders of how to 
live her ideal life, among them is 
the line, “Speak to your brother / 
Check he’s okay.” It’s simple and 
sweet, but sometimes that’s all 
that is necessary to extend love. 
And while such lyrics may seem 
simple, they serve a grand pur -
pose. 
Bea admits that her lyricism 
is not entirely traditional, in the 
sense that she sees them as ve -
hicles for her melodies rather 
than for acute storytelling, and 
these intentions are clear on 
nearly every track. Her focus is 
on the emotions she can induce. 
Among the bubbly chorus of 
“Sunny Day,” she sings, “I’ll keep you posted / I promise I’m bet -
ter,” and “I’m sorry for yesterday,” 
which is enough to capture /f_leet -
ing feelings of guilt and hope but 
not enough to structure a true 
storyline. “Broken CD” is another 
strong example of her use of lyrics 
as sonic tools for communicating 
emotions over ideas. She repeats 
in a high, so/f_t voice, “Don’t think 
I’m over it/ Like I always said I 
was/ Like a broken CD.” /T_he song 
is a repetition of these lines, and 
drives home this sentiment of 
sad, self-realization without any 
clear images, but eventually leads 
the listener into a more musically 
upbeat tone while still keeping 
the same lyrics. Sometimes things 
don’t entirely make sense in “Be -atopia,” and trying to follow any 
single idea is futile. Sometimes 
emotions are blunt and other 
times whimsical, but collectively 
they are childlike and serve to 
honor the escapist little girl inside 
her. 
“Beatopia” is light and fun and 
blossoms because of the fact that 
it doesn’t take itself too seriously. 
It’s her happiest body of work and 
takes its most emotionally intense 
moments in stride. It’s a healing 
album about making peace, Bea 
/f_inds herself and praises the child 
who should have been honored 
for her creativity long ago.

cal and social /f_igures are put in harm’s way and Commissioner Lau is blamed for a very 
public assassination. In an attempt to bring Lau to safety, he is told to /f_lee, and Won -
der Woman follows. Unfortunately, she is captured, and /T_hief Catcher and the Invis -
ible Woman are le/f_t to not only bring her back, but keep the President safe and /f_ind the 
source of the clean water to restore it for the city. In the midst of all of this, action-packed 
scenes with casual /f_irings of machine guns and a villain with an eerie, comedic quality 
are thrown into the mix to keep audiences entertained and invested. Having seen “/T_he 
Heroic Trio” the previous day, I was excited to see how the sequel would play out. /T_here is 
slightly less chaos, and a stronger plot, but the lively action and witty script makes for an 
equally memorable experience.“Before, Now, and /T_hen”
By Fabian Garcia
/T_he /f_inal day of the San Diego Asian Film Festival began with “Before, Now and /T_hen” 
by writer and director Kamila Andini. Taking notes from the likes of Wong Kar Wai and 
Andapichatpong Weerasethakul, the /f_ilm skirts along a central theme of adultery and 
family whilst engrossing you in 60’s rural Indonesia. /T_he “In /T_he Mood For Love-esque” 
framing device is something that’s been attempted before; however, something about this 
take feels quite captivating — likely due to the prominent focus on the central /f_igure Nana, 
wonderfully portrayed by Happy Salma. 
A lot of playful framing puts Nana in interesting situations, and you get a sense of her 
thoughts just by reading her minute facial expressions. Several quiet moments in the /f_ilm 
are spent watching her doing mundane tasks, not speaking a single word. However, you 
can still tease out the feeling in every little action she makes. 
If that isn’t enough, sometimes we are allowed into her thoughts thanks to the many 
dream sequences the /f_ilm places us in. While these are usually far from subtle, they add a 
degree of welcome abstraction from the more straightforward narrative at play. It’s special 
to see a character like Nana develop on screen, and while a lot of her growth happens quite 
rapidly, there is still a relative payoﬀ. 
“Before, Now and /T_hen” isn’t afraid to take things slowly. It’s also not afraid to alienate 
its viewers, and that’s an incredibly bold choice for such a straightforward /f_ilm. It would 
be nice to see this style of theming replicated in another project. /T_here just seems to be so 
much potential that hasn’t been fully tapped into here. 
In any case, it’s hard to imagine a better way to cap oﬀ /T_he UCSD Guardians’ stay at 
SDAFF, and we look forward to what’s in store next year.

Learn more about the bird through

show at the UC San Diego Library has 
become a community tradition. Kids 
are welcome (and they’ll be reciting

interest. Host and bandleader Scott 
Paulson, a UC San Diego alumnus, and 
Exhibits & Events Coordinator at the 
UC San Diego Library, has been lauded 
by the San Diego Union-Tribune for his 
entertaining shows: “an avant-garde 
vaudevillian, think Samuel Beckett 
meets John Cage.” The Los Angeles 
Times relayed “Paulson’s brand of 
G-rated fun, a sort of modern day 
morphing of Captain Kangaroo and 
Spike Jones, is always lively and at 
times wonderfully chaotic.”
ALL DAY
UC SAN DIEGO THEATRE + 
DANCE PRESENTS: 
MACHINAL /hyphen.case THEODORE AND 
ADELE SHANK THEATRE
First performed on Broadway in 1928, 
Machinal may read initially as a period 
piece. References to speakeasies, 
“expensive” twelve dollar a night hotels, 
and radio certainly ground the play 
squarely in the circumstances of the late 
1920’s. It is tempting to treat this play 
like a period piece, celebrating the 
peculiarities and sensibilities of the 
1920s. But this interpretation does a 
disservice to the text, which was 
decidedly modern in its time. Revivals of 
Machinal must not fetishize the text or 
allow it to be something the audience 
can feel distant from. Sophie Treadwell 
wrote Machinal in response to the true 
story of Ruth Snyder, the first woman to 
be executed by the state of New York for 
murdering her husband. Ruth Snyder’s 
trial was highly sensationalized, and 
lead an entire nation to try to answer 
why a woman might murder her 
husband. Sophie Treadwell felt 
compelled to answer this question by 
writing an expressionist account of the 
stifling, misogynistic society women of 
her time were forced to contend with. 
Ruth Snyder’s trial was in 1927, and by 
1928 Machinal was already being 
performed on Broadway. Sophie 
Treadwell did not set out to write a 
period piece about the 1920’s-she wrote 
an intensely urgent piece of theatre in 
response to the realities of her own 
modern times.THE BOOKSTORE’S ANNUAL HOLIDAY SALE

Will the “Golden Generation” Live Up to the Hype? Your 
USMNT World Cup Preview 
By Kurt Johnston
/gid00004/gid00016/gid00015/gid00021/gid00019/gid00010/gid00003/gid00022/gid00021/gid00010/gid00015/gid00008/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
A/f_ter eight years, four months, 
and ten days, the United States 
men’s soccer team  will once again 
be a part of the FIFA World Cup. 
Since crashing out of the Round 
of 16 in 2014, USMNT fans have 
seen legendary players retire, an 
incredibly disappointing failure to 
qualify in 2018, and three much-
maligned head coaches. Despite 
these setbacks, the team enters 
the 2022 World Cup in Qatar with 
incredible optimism — and facing 
daunting expectations. 
/T_his year’s edition of the US -
MNT is unlike any other team 
before it. /T_hey are younger than 
ever, with an average age of 24 
and being the second youngest of 
the teams in Qatar and the young -
est in U.S. history. /T_hey are more 
outspoken; like their counterparts 
on the women’s team, the US -
MNT has been vocal about social 
issues and promise to continue 
to do so at the World Cup. Most 
importantly, they are incredibly 
talented. Unlike USMNT squads 
in the past, this team has play -
ers who play regularly for world-
class clubs (e.g. Chelsea, Juventus, 
Dortmund, AC Milan). While 
competition in North America is 
incomparable to the level of the 
World Cup, this new-generation 
United States team is competitive. 
So far, the USMNT is undefeated 
in four straight matches, tallying 
three wins and a draw, against a 
powerful Mexico team.
/T_he USMNT’s biggest strength 
is in their attacking quality. Coach 
Gregg Berhalter will facilitate his 
attack through Christian Pulisic, 
whose skill on the ball makes him a dangerous chance creator when 
running at defenders. /T_he Chelsea 
le/f_t winger will be complement -
ed on the right side by Timothy 
Weah or Brenden Aaronson, two 
players who are skillful on the ball 
and can press opponents high. In 
central mid/f_ield, Yunus Musah 
and Giovanni Reyna are both ex -
cellent dribblers who can beat de -
fenders and advance possession. 
Weston McKennie, if cleared to 
start, is one of the world’s best at 
scoring on set pieces. 
/T_he striker is the weakest posi -
tion for the U.S. in attack, but Josh 
Sargent (9 goals in 19 appearances 
for Norwich City) and Jesus Fer -
reira (18 goals in MLS this year) 
present a pressing threat in front 
of goal. Haji Wright has scored 9 
goals in 12 for Antalyaspor lead -
ing up to the tournament and will 
hope to stay hot coming oﬀ the 
bench.
Despite their attacking 
strength, the USMNT is com -
paratively weak defensively. One 
bright spot is mid/f_ielder Tyler Ad -
ams, who, according to PFF FC, 
has the best challenge grade in the 
Premier League this season play -
ing for Leeds United. Behind him 
are center backs Walker Zimmer -
man and Tim Ream, who will be 
expected to play a high line. /T_his 
may create problems for the U.S., 
as Ream’s 35-year-old legs will not 
be able to keep up with the pacy 
wingers of their opponents. An -
tonee Robinson is a solid defender 
on the le/f_t, but both he and fellow 
fullback Sergiño Dest are oﬀen -
sive-minded players who are liable 
to be caught out of position. 
/T_he goalkeeper position has 
also been controversial. Coach 
Berhalter chose not to select pre -
sumed starter Zack Steﬀen and in -stead named Arsenal backup Matt 
Turner to the starting role. Turner 
is a good shot-stopper and com -
petent with his feet but simply has 
not played enough club soccer this 
season to inspire much con/f_idence 
in USMNT fans. 
/T_he USMNT’s /f_irst Group B 
test will be against Wales, led by 
star man and recent MLS Cup 
winner Gareth Bale. /T_he Welsh 
side has done well in tournament 
competitions before, reaching the 
semi/f_inals of the European Cham -
pionships in 2016. However, the 
USMNT’s newfound skill should 
be enough to see them through 
if they can /f_ind some goals from 
their strikers. Prediction: 1-0 US -
MNT.England will pose the big -
gest test for the Americans in the 
group. Players like Harry Kane, 
Phil Foden, and Jude Bellingham 
have the ability to wreak havoc on 
opposing defenders, and the US -
MNT’s mid/f_ield will have trouble 
keeping possession. However, 
England has a history of disap -
pointing at the World Cup, and 
there may be a slim chance for the 
U.S. to take a point from this one. 
Prediction: 3-1 England.
/T_he /f_inal and most crucial 
game of Group B will be against 
Iran led by Mehdi Taremi, who 
has been a goal machine for Porto 
this season. He’s been impressive 
in the Champions League this sea -
son, scoring 5 goals in 5 matches. Iran’s hopes to advance in the 
group will rest on his shoulders, 
but he is supported by a comple -
ment of good attacking options. 
/T_his is not a matchup USMNT 
fans should underestimate. Pre -
diction: 2-1 USMNT (barely).
Americans will expect the US -
MNT to get out of the group, but 
it is very uncertain if they will do 
so. For all of their youth and qual -
ity, only one player of the 26 has 
played in a World Cup before. 
/T_his team may surprise and be the 
Cinderella story of Qatar, but they 
may just as easily /f_inish last in the 
group. Either way, the potential of 
this U.S. side certainly guarantees 
an exciting 2022 World Cup for 
U.S. fans.

UC San Diego’s men’s basket -
ball team started oﬀ the year on 
a bad foot, losing their /f_irst two 
games this season. UCSD was 
looking to bounce back in their 
third straight home game of the 
year in front of a record crowd of 
3,071 people. UCSD (1–2, 0–0 Big 
West) took on UC Berkeley (0–3, 
0–0 Pac-12) with both teams look -
ing to have their /f_irst win of the 
season. /T_he /f_irst half of the game 
was dominated by the Tritons on 
both ends of the /f_loor, allowing 
them to take a huge lead early on. 
UC Berkeley was able to creep 
back into the game in the second 
half, but the Tritons ultimately 
came out on top, winning 64–62. 
/T_hey were able to prevail with a 
clutch performance coming from 
their star redshirt junior guard 
Bryce Pope, who hit the shot to 
put them up by 4 points late in the 
game to seal the deal.  
/T_he /f_irst whistle blew, and the 
Tritons were oﬀ to a great start. 
A/f_ter the /f_irst nine minutes of 
the game, the Tritons were up big 
from a 3-pointer from redshirt 
junior forward Jake Kosakowski, 
pushing the lead to 13 at a score 
of 19–6. Defensive intensity al -
lowed the Tritons to get out in 
transition and make big plays, 
especially from the 3-point line. 
With seven minutes le/f_t in the /f_irst half, the Tritons fought for 
a defensive rebound and pushed 
the ball up the /f_loor to Pope who 
scored a 3-pointer, which pushed 
the Tritons’ lead to 18 at a score of 
28–10. /T_he Tritons were locked in, 
defensively forcing UC Berkeley 
to a shooting percentage of 31% 
for the entire /f_irst half. Unfortu -
nately for the Tritons, the Golden 
Bears made a push toward the end 
of the /f_irst half to bring the game 
to 37–27.  
/T_he Tritons played their best 
half of the year thus far, shooting 
53% from the 3-point line, which 
was their highest 3-point per -
centage in a half this season. /T_he 
Tritons’ defensive eﬀorts paid oﬀ  
heavily as they led the /f_irst half 
with 15 points oﬀ of 8 UC Berke -
ley turnovers, which was integral 
to building their large lead. /T_heir 
leading scorer was Pope at 11 
points including shooting 3 of 4 
from distance in the /f_irst half. /T_he 
Tritons were in pole position to 
put the Cal Bears down. 
Kicking oﬀ the second half, 
the Tritons picked up right where 
they le/f_t oﬀ. /T_he Tritons pushed 
the lead to 14 with 13 minutes le/f_t 
in the game oﬀ of a Pope 3-point -
er. Unfortunately for the Tritons, 
they started to go cold from the 
3-point line, and the oﬀense went 
stagnant. /T_his allowed UC Berke -
ley to get back into the game; with 
5 minutes le/f_t the Golden Bears 
pulled within 1 point at a score -
line of 59–58. /T_he Tritons were in real trouble if they couldn’t /f_igure 
something out quickly. With one 
minute le/f_t in the game, redshirt 
junior guard Jace Roquemore was 
able to get to the free throw line 
and sink two integral free throws 
to increase the lead to 3 points. 
UC Berkeley responded instantly 
with a quick layup pulling within 
one point once again. With 30 
seconds le/f_t in the game, the ball 
landed back in Pope’s hands to try 
and score the dagger. Pope drove 
le/f_t and attempted a contested 
/f_loater that missed just right of the rim, where sophomore forward 
Francis Nwaokorie got the biggest 
rebound of the game and passed 
it back out to Pope. /T_his time 
Pope would not miss, as he hit a 
nice crossover and pulled up for 
a 3-pointer, pushing the Tritons’ 
lead to 3 with six seconds le/f_t. /T_he 
Tritons were able to through, win -
ning 64–62.  
A/f_ter the game, /T_he UCSD 
Guardian caught up with Pope to 
ask him about his clutch dagger: 
“We had a play to get me the ball, 
coach told me to go make a play, I missed the /f_irst shot, but Francis 
with the biggest rebound of the 
year, and I got isolated and made 
a 3 in rhythm. Now, we’re going 
home, it feels great, ” Pope said. 
Coach Olen also commented on 
Pope’s performance: “He’s a guy 
that can make tough shots late 
in the clock, he can kinda create 
his own, our group needs that… ” 
Olen said.
/T_he Tritons will next go on the 
road to take on George Washing -
ton University on Tuesday, Nov.
