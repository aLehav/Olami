By Omair Qazi
Staff Writer
The University of California 
received a record number of enroll-
me
nt applications for fall 2009, but 
saw a significant decrease in appli-ca 
tion growth compared to previous years. UCSD incurred a 0.7 percent decrease in applicants for the class of 2013 compared to the number of applications received last year. 
UC spokesman Ricardo Vazquez 
said the drop in enrollment growth is a result of a smaller high-school graduating class. 
“We are still seeing continued 
growth despite the decrease in [high- school] graduates and that indicates that there is a strong demand among California students for a UC educa-ti
on, ” Vazquez said. 
The UC department of finance has 
projected incremental decreases in the number of graduating public high-school seniors over the next few years before the application rate stabilizes. According to Vazquez, demographic shifts like these are not uncommon in the UC system’s history.
UCLA secured the highest num-
ber 
of applications, followed by UC 
Berkeley and UCSD. UC Merced and UC Riverside received the fewest applicants. 
According to Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Admissions Mae W . Brown, out of 47,032 applicants, Regents’ decision to cut 
enro
llment by over 2,000 
wi
ll result in fewer offers 
from top campuses, more from Merced.

FIRST STEM-
CELL STUD Y 
ON HUMANS
By David Harvey
Senior Staff Writer
Using research and methodol-
ogy 
developed by UC Irvine’s Hans 
Keirstead, California-based stem-cell 
research company Geron will be the world’s first to conduct clinical trials on people using human embryonic stem cells following federal govern-men
t approval earlier this month in 
a procedure that will attempt to treat acute spinal-cord injuries.
Keirstead gained international 
attention in 2006 when his lab pub-lis
hed results showing the successful 
use of stem cells to repair damage in the cellular sheath protecting spinal nerves in mice. The procedure induc-es s
tem cells — capable of transform-
ing 
into any cell type — to become 
those that reconstruct the sheath pro-te 
cting spinal nerves. Without this 
protective coating, electrical impulses fail to complete their path, leaving victims paralyzed below their injury.
Less than a dozen paralyzed 
subjects will participate in Geron’s nationwide trials, receiving treatment  seven to 14 days after injury, the peri-od 
deemed suitable for the procedure, 
according to Keirstead’s studies. 
Evan Snyder, a professor at the 
Burnham Institute for Medical Research, said in an online forum that this trial will monitor several possible side effects, such as the emergence of cell types inappropriate to the ner-vo
us system like muscle or bone cells, 
the overgrowth of transplanted cells causing tumors and compression of nerve fibers that could instead inhibit function in patients.
“Until there is some data from 
this study it won’t have much impact on current research, ” said Larry Goldstein, director of stem-cell research at UCSD. “We won’t know for some time. ... It is a shot in the arm for the field but this is still a phase-one trial. ”After Months at the Bullhorn, Workers Secure Wage Hike
By Jesse Alm
Associate News Editor
The University of California 
reached a tentative contract settle-men 
t with the American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal Employees Wednesday morning, closing a 15-month bargaining peri-od 
for its 8,500 service workers.
Since October 2007, the custodi-
an
s, gardeners, food-service workers 
and bus drivers have picketed, lob-bie 
d and gone on strike statewide 
to decry UC executive salaries and demand a living wage.
“ After a year and half of nego-
ti 
ations, this is truly a historic day, ” 
said Lakesha Harrison, president of AFSCME Local 3299. “[Our actions] were key to getting UC executives to do the right thing and readjust their priorities from executives to the low-est-p
aid workers at UC. ”
The five-year contract includes 
annual, across-the-board raises of 3 percent — paid retroactively through October 2008 — as well as an addi-tio
nal 1 percent bonus effective in 
July of this year. All service workers will reach a statewide minimum wage of $14 per hour by January 2013, up from the current minimum of $10.28, and a series of category-spe-cific 
increases will reward employees 
for their experience.
In addition, contract language prevents the university from modify-ing 
health care and retirement ben-
efi
ts without union approval.
Shelley Nielsen, the university’s 
chief negotiator for the contract, said she is proud that service workers will finally receive the compensation they deserve.

UCSD Senior Pioneers Domestic-Partnership Initiative
By Vanessa Do
Senior Staff Writer
Voter approval of Proposition 
8 last November — which ended same-sex marriage in California — inspired one UCSD student to create the Domestic-Partnership Initiative, a project aimed at finding a compro-mi
se between the debate’s pro and 
con camps. 
Founded by John Muir College 
senior Ali Shams, the initiative calls for the word “marriage” to be removed from California law and replaced with “domestic partner-sh
ip, ” repealing Proposition 8 and giving legal equality to all couples regardless of sexual orientation. 
The California constitution cur-
re 
ntly states that “only marriage 
between a man and a woman is valid and recognized in California. ” According to Shams, the initiative’s goal is to take “marriage” out of the constitution entirely, rendering it a social ceremony rather than a politi-ca
l institution. 
Shams hopes this compromise 
can resolve the Proposition 8 dispute without offending those opposed to gay marriage for religious reasons. 
“I grew up with a different ethnic-
it
y and people would discriminate for being a minority, ” Shams said. “But this is California, we’re sup-po
sed to be liberal. It’s  not fair for 
p
eople to get married, and then to 
have their rights removed. I also real-iz 
e that the religious community may 
not follow these things and it’s hard to persuade them to look past their religious beliefs, so a compromise is necessary. ”
California Institute of the Arts 
student Kaelan Housewright is work-in
g alongside Shams.
“By making marriage a social 
institution, we will create equal-it 
y for both men and women within 
the state, regardless of their sex-ua
l orientation,” Housewright 
said. “Furthermore, the Domestic Partnership Initiative upholds the belief of separation of church and state put forth by Thomas Jefferson and the First Amendment of our Constitution. ”
Housewright and Shams submit-
te
d the initiative to the state attorney 
general’s office last week, where it now awaits fiscal analysis and the official title and summary that would appear on the petition. 
Shams hopes to receive the title 
and summary on March 9, and will See WORKERS, page 3Contract stipulates

In the past 15 months, students, faculty, staff and community members have repeatedly gathered on Library Walk to support wage increases for the university’s 
8,500 service workers. Their efforts have been part of a statewide movement marked by boycotts, sit-ins, letter writing and a five-day strike.

SUNNY SIDE UPSTEVE AND LUCKY
 BY PHILIP  RHIE BY BEN HOLM
The Alumni Association has 
named five UCSD graduates to be 
honored at its 31st Annual Awards for Excellence event, on Saturday, June 6.  
The honorees include Donald W. 
Murphy, the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center’s chief executive officer; Abbie Celniker, a renowned molecular biologist; Jeffrey Rabin, UCSD professor of math-ematics and former co-director of the Algebraic Thinking Institute; Gary Curtis, a biomedical entrepreneur; and Wayne Kennedy, UCSD’s former vice chancellor of administration and the UC Office of the President’s for-mer senior vice president of business and finance.
Ticket sales for the event, which 
is open to alumni and the general public, will raise funds for the alumni association’s endowed scholarship programs.  
The UCSD alumni award recipi-
ents will join other accomplished individuals who have received the award, such as Roger Revelle.Alumni Association to 
Honor Award RecipientsCURRENTS
UCSD expects to enroll a freshman 
class of 3,775. 
Overall, UC applicants had a 
mean GPA of 3.67 with an average SAT score of 1,726 and an average ACT score of 25. UCSD applicants had a mean GPA of 3.77, while those applying to UCLA and UC Berkeley held, on average, 3.79 and 3.84 GPAs respectively. 
“The quality of the UC freshman 
applicant pool remains high, and this year’s outcomes are generally consistent with the last two cycles, ” Vazquez said.
Despite the decrease in freshman 
applicants, transfer applications to the UC system increased by 13 per-cent, and by 17 percent to UCSD specifically. 
At the advisement of UC President 
Mark G. Yudof, the Board of Regents voted this month to cut 2009-10 freshman enrollment by 2,300 stu-dents due to a lack of state funding. However, at the same meeting, the regents also increased the number of systemwide transfer enrollments by 500 students. 
“[Transfer enrollment] is very important to us, ” Vazquez said. “It’s a path that is important to be kept open, especially since it is cost-effec-tive for many students in these eco-nomic times. ”
UCSD plans to adhere to Yudof ’s 
request to reduce freshman enroll-ment targets. 
“We are overenrolled at the fresh-
man level and are trying to bring our enrollment in greater alignment with the funding provided by the state so the reduction at the freshman level is appropriate, ” Brown said.
Despite a lack of funding, Brown 
said UCSD will ensure that “we continue to offer quality academic programs for those students that accept our offer of admission. ” She said there are diverse programs for those entering at either the freshman or transfer level, and the university makes no recommendation regard-ing which path a student should choose to enter the university. 
Despite the curtailment of fresh-
man enrollment, the university will still offer placement at a UC campus to every eligible California resident who applied. According to Vazquez, students who are eligible and are not 
admitted by any of their preferred campuses will be referred to UC Riverside or UC Merced. 
Despite slow application growth 
overall, ethnic and racial minori-ties increased their presence in the application pool this year. American Indians  showed the largest rise, with 
a
n 18.9 percent increase in applica-
tions compared to last year. Latino applicants rose by 9 percent, while black applicants rose by 5.8 per-cent and Asian American applicants increased by 4.8 percent. 
“We are very pleased with the 
healthy jump in applications from African American and Chicano/Latino [groups], particularly at the transfer level, ” Vazquez said.
According to university offi-
cials, with enrollment caps and the increase in freshman applications this year, admission will be more restrictive. As a result, students who may have qualified for admission at three campuses in prior years will most likely receive one or two accep-tances this year.

Approval for the trial came just 
after the inauguration of President 
Barack Obama, who co-sponsored the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007 and promised to repeal former President George W . Bush’s moratorium on federal funding for studies using embryonic stem-cell lines, or batches, derived from embryos after August 9, 2001. 
“Many of our best investiga-
tions [at UCSD] have federal fund-ing and they’ve been very limited on which stem-cell lines they can use, ” Goldstein said. “Studies that receive private funds with nonfeder-ally approved lines have been limited because equipment has been federally funded. We have to forgo the use of that equipment in those investiga-tions. ”
In California, private dona-
tions and funding made available by 2004’s passage of Proposition 71, which made $3 billion available for the development of human embry-onic stem cells, have supported much of the research being conducted, including Keirstead’s and a portion of UCSD’s stem-cell research. 
Worldwide, 10 labs obtained stem-
cell lines prior to Bush’s announce-ment, falling safely within the allowed guidelines for federal funding.
Geron’s trial would be eligible 
for federal funding regardless of the policy’s reversal as it uses one of the federally approved lines, and both Geron CEO, Thomas B. Okarma, and a spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration said poli-tics had little to do with the trial’s approval. 
“[This trial] marks the dawn of 
a new era in medical therapeutics, ” Okarma said. “This approach is one that reaches beyond pills and scalpels to achieve a new level of healing. ”

ment, and one that rewards our ser-vice workers for their continued hard work and dedication to the university, ” she said. “The university worked very hard throughout the process to bring the negotiations to a successful con-clusion, and ultimately compromises by both sides enabled us to reach an agreement. ”
Lt. Gov. John Garamendi, a UC 
regent, was part of an outspoken coali-tion of public officials supporting the union throughout negotiations by writing letters and meeting with uni-versity officials.
“This is a good settlement, ” he 
said. “It will give some of the lowest-paid workers at the greatest university system in the world enough of a salary to meet the minimum needs of their families. ”
He added that despite the uni-
versity’s repeated efforts to attribute the stalled negotiations to California’s budget crisis, the contract was largely independent of state funds.
“Only a small portion of the work-
er’s contract comes from the state bud-get, ” he said.
UCSD groundskeeper Jorge 
Olvera, who has led several dem-onstrations on Library Walk in past months, said the contract is not per-fect by any means. He cited parking, in particular, as a rising expense on 
which the university was unwilling to compromise. 
However, he called the contract 
a symbolic precedent for future UC labor negotiations.
“It’s a moral victory more than 
anything else, ” he said. “This is a pub-lic institution, and it belongs to the people of California. [The contract] is a step in the right direction in being able to change the culture of the uni-versity. ”
Harrison said she expects union 
members to ratify the contract by early next month.
Readers can contact Jesse Alm at 
jessealm@gmail.edu.Unlike last week, there was only one member of the public present in the forum cham-
bers at last night’s A.S. Council meet-ing. Jackie Beoris  came in as a rep-
resentative from the Global Brigade, a year-old organization that has been rapidly expanding and reaching out to university campuses nation-wide.
“I just wanted to speak to you to 
remind you that we exist and let you know that we may ask you for support in the future, ” Beoris said.
Reports followed, during which 
Vice President of Student Life Darryl Nousome  
to
ld the council on 
behalf of Associate Vice President of P r o g r a m m i n g Garrett Berg  that 
all Death Cab for Cutie student tickets were sold, yielding $30,000 in ticket sales.
President Donna Bean  remind-
ed everyone that there would be a meeting on Friday for those inter-ested in running for office as part of the Student Voice! slate in the Spring Quarter general election. She added that there will soon be a discussion regarding the addition of a Loft fee provision on the general election bal-lot in order to provide the funding that the Loft needs to survive.
There were few reports from com-
mittees, but conversation stalled for some 20 minutes on a request for $650 from the Inter-Fraternity Council for Greek columns, which was sponsored by Associate Vice President of Athletic Relations Peter Benesch . 
Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Naasir Lakhani  objected 
to the allocation on the basis that IFC had requested and was awarded the same amount the previous quarter.
“C’mon, its 650 bucks, ” Associate Vice President of Student Advocacy Frank Carroll said. “Look at how much we fund the Koala !”
(For the record, the Koala  is fund-
ed $2,500 per quarter.)  Ultimately, the council approved the allocation.
During open forum Lakhani told 
councilmembers that he would not be able to represent them in the Mr. Alpha Chi competition, prompting All-Campus Senator Chris Westling 
to
 quickly nominate Biological 
Sciences Senator Daniel Nguyen.
“W
ait, are you serious?” Nguyen 
asked after a brief pause.  “What does this actually entail?”
L a k h a n i   
explained that he would be coached in the art of pag-
eantry and showcasing a talent. After several minutes of serious introspec-tion, Nguyen announced that he had no discernable talent and respectfully declined the nomination.
Carroll then revealed a softer, 
more vulnerable side of himself, which momentarily sobered up the council.  In recent weeks, councilmembers have come under a significant amount of criticism since the circulation of the first drafts of a resolution condemn-ing the recent acts of violence in Gaza, deeply affecting certain councilmem-bers, including Carroll.
“I’m not very emotional as you 
can tell by my nickname that’s been circulating around, ‘the Beast, ’” Carroll said. “But I’m upset and offended by the accusations that I can’t do my job because of the color of my skin. I just want people to be careful and realize what they’re saying. ”
The meeting, though not entirely 
sweet, was certainly shorter than last week’s, which dragged on for over six hours. Free of Tricky Resolutions, Council

When California vot-
er
s narrowly approved 
Proposition 8 last 
November, the state constitu-ti 
on was amended to eliminate the 
right of same-sex couples to marry. Religious groups immediately hailed the victory as a defense for the tradi-ti
onal meaning of “marriage, ” claim-
in
g the one-man, one-woman insti-
tu
tion should never be altered to 
accommodate changing attitudes or alternative views, while gay-rights advocates recoiled in shock, vow-in
g to press on in their struggle for 
equality. 
Both sides, however, vowed 
to defend their interests, with Proposition 8 opponents charging minority rights can never be taken away through popular vote and tra-di
tional-marriage supporters claim-
in
g their cause had been vindicated 
once and for all. The California Supreme Court will have the ulti-ma
te say when it revisits the issue 
later this year.
Meanwhile, John Muir College 
senior Ali Shams, along with California Institute of the Arts student Kaelan Housewright, have thrown a wrench into the machine, leading an initiative that would banish the word “marriage” from the state’s lexi-co
n entirely, instead replacing it with 
“domestic partnership. ” 
Their goal is to remove the reli-
gi
ous connotations associated with 
marriage entirely by renaming all state-recognized unions as domestic partnerships, thus rendering them sociopolitical contracts rather than religious rituals. Aiming to appease pious citizens who refuse to budge on their antigay views, they see the initiative as a fair solution to the problem of semantics, allowing theologians to keep their allegedly unalterable practice while simulta-ne
ously granting equal recognition 
to all committed couples regardless of sexual orientation.
Although the move was meant 
with the noblest of intentions, the effort will most likely fail. Too many people won’t to give up their marriag-es 
for an attempt at political correct-
ne
ss, with the strongest opposition 
surely coming from Californians who might support expanding marriage rights to same-sex couples but who do not want to lose the meaning of their own marriages. 
No one dreams of “domestic 
partnering” the person they love; in our society, marriage is the term embraced by the vast majority of people — religious or atheist, gay or straight — and it is highly unlikely people will be willing to give up such a deeply ingrained institution so easily. 
However, by forcing Californians 
to confront the idea that their own heterosexual marriages could poten-ti
ally be reclassified, Shams and 
Housewright have opened up a new chapter in the fight for marriage equality. Hopefully, citizens will use this initiative as a means to realize that it is time to stop fighting about semantics, and expand the right to marry to their gay and lesbian neigh-bo
rs, or risk losing it altogether.
University of California President Mark G. Yudof ’s newest proposal to cover sys-
te
mwide fees for students whose fam-
ili
es earn below $60,000 annually isn’t 
a radical concept: Not only are the 1,100 students who would be affected by the plan already covered by federal aid and grant programs, but other prestigious research institutions have already adopted similar ideas.  Simply put, Yudof ’s proposal — named the Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan — is a public-relations move cre-at
ed to make the already-available aid 
offered to low-income students seem more accessible.
And that’s exactly why it’s a good 
idea.
As worries of college afford-
ab
ility grow with increasing inac-
ce
ssibility to private loans, Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger’s proposed Cal Grant cuts and the UC Board of Regents’ consideration to raise undergraduate student fees, many uniformed lower-income families whose children may be first-genera-ti
on college applicants are unsure of 
whether they can afford a University of California education. By making a blanket guarantee for a certain income bracket and effectively pub-li
cizing it to families, the univer-
si
ty will both restore confidence in 
higher education’s affordability and reduce confusing paperwork.
Even better, this measure’s annu-
al 
 $3.1 million cost, which would 
come from increasing the amount of fee revenue reserved for financial aid from 33 percent to 36 percent, wouldn’t affect the grants offered to UC students with family incomes between $60,000 and $100,000, both ensuring full aid to low-income families without cutting that of the middle class. Paired with Yudof ’s proposals 
to increase next year’s transfer stu-de
nt enrollment, the Blue and Gold 
Opportunity Plan would ultimately push for a greater racial and socio-ec
onomic mix and support the UC 
system’s goals of providing higher education to all California residents — an aspect of the UC mission threatened by state budget cuts.
While it’s obvious this proposal 
is the same old financial-aid sys-te
m with a new title, at the very 
least it offers a spoonful of sugar to help struggling low-income families  swallow sour economic times.Financial-Aid Makeover Will Raise Confidence, Ease WorriesMarriage or Domestic Partnership — It’s All  SemanticsEDITORIALS

BEN HOLM /GUARDIANGone are the days where an awkward elevator ride with a stranger would be filled 
with eerie silence. Instead, awk-wa

replaced with the fingers-punching-digits click of phone keypads. But choosing your iPhone over a strang-er
 is only the beginning. A coffee 
date to catch up with an old friend is no longer a sentimental conversa-ti
on, but rather a series of paused, 
incomplete sentences, interrupted 
by an important text or e-mail. In 
this supposedly advanced century, our lives revolve around technology and texting; e-mail and Facebook make us the most disconnected gen-er
ation, as simple human pleasures 
are left by the wayside.
Working at a classy Italian res-
ta
urant this summer, I witnessed 
the degree to which a certain fam-il 
y of three had succumbed to tech-
no
logy’s firm and unforgiving grip. 
Every Saturday night, the mother and father entered the restaurant with their daughter trailing behind, laptop under her arm and head-ph
ones in ears. She sat down at the 
table, plugged into cyberspace and checked out of the real world. As her parents ate their pasta in silence, she remained fixated on the screen, shoveling food into her mouth with-ou
t so much as a blink, only occa-
si
onally looking up to make sure she 
hadn’t spilled any tomato sauce on her Macbook. Her parents made no attempt to engage her in conversa-ti

NATIONAL NEWS —  All across 
the country, students, teachers and administrators gave a small sigh of relief as the $819 billion economic stimulus bill containing $150 bil-li
on for education made it through 
the House of Representatives yes-te 
rday. Now, they are holding their 
breaths once again, anxiously await-in 
g Senate approval of the American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act — a bill that will increase the federal Pell Grant budget from $19 billion to $27 billion and provide extra aid to school districts, special education and pre-kindergarten programs. 
The bill provides a short-term boost in education funding, which is particularly essential for stu-de
nts who fall on the socioeco-
no
mic scale’s lower end and rely on 
Pell Grants to finance their college tuitions. The maximum amount of Pell funds will be raised to $4,860 per student for the 2009-10 award year. This bill is one step closer to achieving President Barack Obama’s campaign promise of increasing Pell Grants while at the same time keep-in
g up with college inflation. Obama 
plans to expand the Pell Grant to $5,400 per student in the next few years. With the proposed cuts for Cal Grants and ever-rising tuitions, other means may be needed to com-pe
nsate, and the Pell increase will 
help blunt the blow of any cuts.
By adding $1.6 billion to Title I 
programs — those that support stu-de 
nts in low-income families — in 
California, the bill will also resus-ci 
tate No Child Left Behind, largely 
criticized by educators for demand-in 
g high standards without financial 
support. According to the Forum on Educational Accountability, the Bush Administration’s budget fell $15 billion short of the amount Congress and the administration authorized for NCLB in 2007. With proper funding, NCLB can promote student performance, rather than punish failing schools. By giving this program more funding, educa-to
rs will come to respect NCLB not 
just for its high-minded ideals but also for its ability to support schools while encouraging greater account-ab
ility.
Students in California with learn-
in
g disabilities would also receive 
$1.4 billion through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, leg-is
lation that oversees and guides spe-
ci
al-education programs. I.D.E.A. 
has been criticized as an unfunded mandate, receiving less than a quar-te
r of Congress’s pledged funds. The 
process of fully funding programs to help special-education students must start again, because these students require additional atten-ti
on and support early on to help them become independent mem-be 
rs of society, which will reduce 
the requirement for social services later on.
While the bill’s passage may have 
been necessary to address short-term needs, it must be molded in a way that will create a solid foundation for future progress. New York Times  
co
lumnist David Brooks called the 
entire stimulus package a “muddled mixture of short-term stimulus haste and long-term spending commit-me
nts. ” However, the last eight years 
have shown that high expectations cannot be paired with a lack of sup-po
rt. Politicians are finally putting 
their money where their mouths are, and with adequate oversight their investments will pay off in the long run. To not pass the bill would sim-pl
y leave the job of economic recov-
er
y to a generation of students who 
remain largely uneducated and thus unable to meaningfully contribute to the taxpayer system.Stimulus Bill Addresses Neglected Educational Goals

without ever having to communi-
ca
te face to face, and when one such 
king cheated on his girl at a random party, her only option was to text a sad face paired with  “we’re over. ”
But, of all the distracting techie 
toys available, there is one ultimate Web site controlling our social prowess and networking ability: Facebook. It becomes clear times have changed when we no longer see gifts as the physical manifestation of someone’s appreciation wrapped in a bow, but rather a digital balloon appearing as one new notification on our news feeds. Bumper stickers are no longer for decorating cars, instead taking the form of Edward Cullen pictures plastered on your wall. And no, I don’t mean your bedroom wall.
Facebook is such a priority that  
choosing the right profile picture takes precedence over a four-page English essay, without question. Even if your relationship status claims you’re single, anyone with the sense to view your wall-to-wall convos knows exactly how you feel about that certain someone. And, most importantly, you know last night wasn’t a success until a photo album has been posted of your drunken adventures.
So the next time you pause from 
your current, intense text fight and notice there’s an old friend with coffee across from you, please take a step back. Our reliance on what we deem to be the advantages of modernity is diminishing necessary human interaction. The rapid growth of technology is inevitable, but I implore you to remember where we came from. Not so long ago, people had survived for centuries without a wireless Internet connection, and boys still got laid without seductive text messages. So, when you’re done reading this column and you begin typing the Facebook Web address into your laptop browser, shut the computer off and walk away. Go outside or talk to your roommate. Overcoming our addiction to con-st
ant social connection takes time, 
but someday we’ll have to learn how to have a real conversation. And if you don’t make the decision to give your BlackBerry a rest, carpal tun-ne
l will for you.THE OTHER  SIDE OF THE COIN By Niven Wilson

But even with all its positive 
and necessary funding, the bill con-ta 
ins questionable provisions that 
reek of special interests — more specifically, a provision that would temporarily increase subsidies for banks in the student-loan program. This could be likened to the inef-fe
ctive bank bailouts, after which 
bank lenders tightened credit stan-da 
rds and, according to a New York 
Times  report, students had a harder 
time qualifying for private loans. As this bill currently stands, it con-tr
adicts Obama’s campaign plan 
to eliminate government subsidies and guarantees for banks and lend-er
s, and undermines his goal of 
allowing greater student access to loans. The bill’s problems are not unsolvable and can be amended to ensure taxpayer money isn’t being misused.
Obama’s new Education Secretary 
Arne Duncan must ensure this boost in funding over a two-year period will be used efficiently and will remain consistent with Obama’s education policy goals — such as removing complex financial-aid forms like the FAFSA, and creating a program to make students aware of their college readiness early on.
An increased government role in 
education will not solve all the sys-tem’s troubles — $150 billion won’t convince students of the importance of college nor will it be the sole factor in determining their success later on down the road. What it does provide is a lifeline and an opportu-ni
ty for students to succeed.
With a competitive global econ-
om
y, there is not a moment to waste 
in investing in America’s future. As America rises out of its economic collapse, it needs educated citizens who will fill jobs and generate taxes. This bill is the first step toward that recovery.

Slamming graffiti textures into patterned sprawls, Mark

this week. Though currently based in L.A., Veca has shipped a truckload of work — ranging from past company collaborations to interior experiments — down the I-5 in hopes of drawing college-student fanfare. And while many installations look to be no more than designs flayed from the walls at Urban Outfitters, his penchant for cartoonish abstractions that pulse through rooms like capillaries will certainly shed an eye-catching glow, much needed on the UCSD art scene.

Rumor has it that Katy Perry’s going acoustic 
for ‘09. The momentary princess of bi-curious 
radiopop released the admittedly less lipsticky “Thinking of You,” a leaf-turning ballad that’s winning brownie points from her numerous critics. Though it might sound more at home on an angsty alt-rock record, who’s to say a girl can’t reinvent herself? Along for the ride are the Daylights, the lucky junior stadium-rockers touring with the biggest pop-tart since Britney. Reminiscent of U2 deities (minus the price of sterling production quality) the band delivers Coldplay-worthy tunes that could herald a couple sold-out gigs. (AC)HOUSE  OF BLUES / FEB. 5 / $15
“The Wild Child”
Peeling off his meteoric success with French new wave 
in the ’60s, Francois Truffaut continued to deliver hits like a hired hand well into the next decade. “The Wild Child” stars the director himself as benign Dr. Jean Itard, in the true story of a child found living alone in the 18th-century woods of France, unable to speak and savagely independent. Lacquered in a tame black-and-white cinematography, the trope of youth finds an apex in the famed director’s newly restored coming-of-age chronicle. The classic runs for one week only at Ken Cinemas.

Suburban Buzzkill: Hutchinson Sobers Up the PubWhat does California sound like?” asks Steven Schick into his cell phone, to me and to himself, reach-ing for a chair in a hotel room 
somewhere in San Francisco. He has freshly arrived via BART from the East Bay after flying in from San Diego, and will soon depart for a weekend of per-cussion-course planning in the Canadian Rockies (“just about as beautiful a place as you’ll find on the planet”).
Seeing as Schick is the one between the two 
of us who, a couple years back, took a six-week, 716-mile stroll up the California coast to record its noise in slowness and openness, I let him answer the question.
“It sounds like people speaking different lan-
guages, it sounds like construction, it sounds like the ocean, it sounds like traffic, it sounds like a — a lot of things, things that have become important to us that we don’t even notice anymore. And if we forget what things sound like, then we pretty soon forget who we are, I think. ”
Schick is far more regal a UCSD landmark than 
“The Cat in the Hat” or the stone bear; his office is a secret garden of grand percussion instruments; he has worked with Philip Glass and John Cage but would love to work with you in office hours. Anyone who’s even come so far as to graze the outer rungs of the music department has a story about him, or has heard one, or at least thinks he must be wonderful. The Beatles class he taught for decades and finally let lie last year — soon to be no more than a legend, as all who bore witness make their way out into the world — will go down in campus

Following in the giant footsteps of his soul-ful idols — Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson — Eric Hutchinson claims 
he needs to sing like he needs to breathe. But he doesn’t stop at the shower: According to his Web site, he sings at coffeehouses and funerals with equal timbre. 
Unfortunately, all that practice couldn’t keep his 
third album, August 2007’s Sounds Like This, from 
deflating. A jumbled reincarnation of Jason Mraz, Jack Johnson and Adam Levine, Hutchinson’s eerily familiar take on the sensitive young songwriter fails to transcend that boy-meets-girl pop grooves formula.
But maybe we should cut Hutchy some slack 
— after all, la-la land can be a tough gig. A brand-new addition to the music biz, the Maryland native graduated from Emerson College in 2001; a film degree, along with a reputation as an open-mic regular in Boston, fueled the dream that prompted his starry-eyed move to Los Angeles. He released 2003’s popcorn debut That Could’ve Gone Better, on 
Madonna’s Let’s Break Records — but six months later, the lucky streak was halted by parent company Warner Bros, who decided to drop Hutch from their lineup. At the end of his rope and scrambling for lunch money, the hopeful managed to squeeze out Before I Sold Out, with tracks like “Breakdown 
More” and “Outside Villanova” spinning through pervasive loneliness and sex with minors, highlight-ing his darker corners and blues-rooted soul. 
Anxious to pull Hutchinson out of his funk, a 
friend recently sent notorious gossip blogger Perez Hilton (aka everyone’s favorite skinny bitcher) his latest album, Sounds Like This . The next day,

Contributing Writer
Regardless of how insultingly predictable a film 
is, it can (and will) still appeal to a major por-tion of the nation — as long as its starring faces 
are pretty enough to watch. With blonde-then-bru-nette, frail-then-fat Hollywood chameleon Renée Zellweger as the featured vehicle in “New in T own, ” the cheeseball flick is destined to draw an enthusi-astic crowd of Bridget Jones  diehards. 
I
t all seemed so promising — an Oscar-win-
ning bombshell and a Danish director (Jonas Elmer), distant enough from the grave chick-flick epidemic that has overtaken our magnifi-cent shores. Alas, Elmer has obviously done his research thoroughly, studying popular American film culture enough to slop out a sapfest as for-mulaic and underwhelming as any other love-potioned Joe Shmoe could in Hollywood.
So here’s the gist (which you could probably 
gather from the minute-long commercial alone): Lucy Hill (Zellweger) is a majorly stressing high-up exec at some deathly important, suspiciously immoral corporation — you know, the kind with all the douchy ties walking around like they’ve got more than a couple things to hide. When her co-workers decide that one of the corporation’s ramshackle factories is costing them money, Hill volunteers to get her hands dirty. She plans to inspect the factory and retrain  its workers, willing 
t
o terminate those who can’t quite meet the chal-
lenge. But there’s a twist: The factory is located in Minnesota — a far cry from the sandy paradise of Hill’s Miami hometown. 
But this blue-collar beauty is blinded by a 
hunger to climb the corporate ladder (why she didn’t just sleep her way to the top will always be a mystery), and thus books the next available flight to Middle America. A true maverick.
Surprise, surprise — it turns out that the state 
of many lakes might as well be a different planet. Not only is the weather 10 times too chilly, but the townies are completely pedestrian. And everyone wears ugly shoes. Zellweger’s arrival recalls that infamous “Legally Blonde” entrance, sans Reese Witherspoon’s glimmer of smarts to offest that thick veneer of West-Coast idiocy. 
Thankfully, Hill doesn’t scorn the wintry nights 
for long. Enter Ted Mitchell (Harry Connick Jr.), sporting a rather somber face — a face he wears for the length of the film — who pretends to despise the shapely suit sent from Florida to lay down the law. The consummation of their secret love is deterred by a classic element of conflict that shouldn’t have been attempted at all, because we’re just waiting for them to make out.
As mentioned, Connick, Jr. is set on stone-face 
autopilot, and, for the immobility of mouth,  deliv-ers all his lines in a crusty monotone. Zellwegger is charming enough, but at the ripe age of 39, her perpetual sucking-on-a-lemon face has reached new extremes, with a pout that almost never unpuckers. An obligatory supporting cast is 
thrown into the mix for comedic value, but they don’t seem ready for even that job.
One exception is J.K. Simmons (known 
for his hilarious portrayal of J. Jonah Jameson in the “Spider Man” films), who plays the exaggerated Stu Kopenhaffer. Simmons has so long been cast as the loud, sardonic, fast-speaking boss that he’s a true master at it, and highlights the film with a glowing performance that almost makes the film worth watching. Almost.
history as the most coveted gen-ed course of all time, with sit-inners spilling out the double doors and a waitlist like a battleground. 
But Schick moves on and resettles where he 
is needed. Last year, on top of professorship, he was named conductor of the La Jolla Symphony and Chorus, and has since created a course in the fall devoted entirely to lab-studying their rehearsals. “Oftentimes in the professional musi-cal world, you play a concert with these groups of people, a little bit like what I’m doing this week — here, then going somewhere else, and the scenery changes all the time, ” he says. “To see the same group time after time after time, rehearsal after rehearsal, and to develop a rapport, a way of working with the same group, has been just fascinating. ”
It was only a matter of time before Schick’s 
ambitions made their way over to the Loft. The new campus venue’s hallmark mission — and ultimately what makes its new-car smell so hard to get rid of, as the over-eclectic, hyper-hip deliv-ery is often clunky  — is to help high art off its gilded easel and rephrase it in colloquial terms, then squeeze it nice and chummy (but still A-line, still in the know) into that comfortingly corpo-rate corner of Price Center. Event coordinators aim to show students the ins and outs of snotty traditions such as fine wine and string concertos, and reveal how nonscary — even how pleasant — those things can be.
Schick’s vision for the new La Jolla Symphony 
Informances series is shrouded in similar educa-tion-meets-entertainment ideals. Only difference is, unlike the somewhat traditionless (at no fault of their own) foundations of the Loft, this music-department darling and good king of Mandeville is equipped with the long-standing respect, ado-ration and hard-earned hipness one can only wear after years at the helm of the scene.
That said, the agenda for Feb. 4 — following 
up a Dec. 4 Informance that set Tijuana dancers ablaze with Indonesian compositions on which to troupe — is almost inconceivably burdened with ambition, continuing in the sccatterbrained tradition of the Loft’s everything-goes lineup. Branching off the La Jolla Symphony’s yearlong “DNA of music” theme is the show-specific focus on “Home, ” weighted by an obligation to tribute Abraham Lincoln and Charles Darwin’s 200th birthdays, and meanwhile adhere to Black History Month with pieces by black composers and a dialogue on their place in the history of classical music. Schick’s idea is to pull themes and elements (pianist here, budding UCSD com-poser there) from the formal La Jolla Symphony concert that will take place on the following weekend, mixing them up with a little hump-day art dialogue and making a night of it.
“Rather than coming simply to a symphony 
orchestra concert, hearing an hour and a half or two hours of music and that’s it, we create a companion concert that will flesh some of those themes out, ” Schick says. And in doing so, in letting everyone in on the varitable rehearsal din-ner and brainstorming phase before the formal Mandeville sit-down, his humble excitement for dialogue shows promise in melting those artier-than-thou barriers the Loft often fumbles to topple. “We’re going to have a discussion also of the relationship of so-called art music — and I don’t know what to call it, I don’t like that term, but you know, music that’s destined for the con-cert stage — we’re going to talk about if there’s a social component to that music. Should we be involved in our community? Should we care about political and social events? Or should we care more?”
If he finds the time — and that’s definitely 
an if, at this rate — Schick would love to retrace 
John Muir’s steps from San Francisco to Y osemite V alley, absorbing that much more of California’s, and therefore our own, natural sounds. But for now, he’s here with us, evolved from a lifetime of experiments into the conductor we need. “Y ou know, the raw material of art — you don’t make art if you don’t have hope, ” he said. “ Art is about the future. ” And so we get started.
The La Jolla Symphony and Chorus’ Informance 
event “Home” will take place Feb. 4 from 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. at the Loft in Price Center East. For the full transcript of Steven Schick’s interview, visit www.ucsdguardian.org/hiatus.

PAPARAZZI QUEEN SETS TWEENS 
INTO HUTCHEADED FRENZY
Hilton listed it as a top 10 fave on 
his Web site, garnering millions of hits literally overnight. 
In nearly every interview, 
Hutchinson still incredulously recalls how, within a few weeks, he had rock-ete
d all the way to No. 9 on iTunes’ 
most-sold list. At the time, he claimed he barely knew who Hilton was. 
Predictably, Warner Bros. pulled 
an “Oh, my bad, ” welcoming him back to the label with open arms. Suddenly, he had fans calling them-se
lves Hutcheads. White-bread 
America wore him as proud as its pastel Uggs and Abercrombie hood-ie
s, blasting sugary, summer-bar-
be
que tunes and extra-cheese odes 
to “Rock and Roll” that sound more like Jason Mraz B-sides.
And why should generation 
Britney care? On “Okay, It’s All Right With Me, ” Hutchinson’s skipping right with them, borrowing Maroon 5’s trademark nasality to spin the kind of apathy one can only feel with a nothing-else-matters mouthful of cotton candy. Dwindling love? “Not the same/ But it’s all right with me, ” he croons. 
The love ballad is, after all, a staple 
of the soul-rock gods our Hutchead worships. He stretches farthest toward “She Will Be Loved” romance on the gravelly “It Hasn’t Been Long Enough” — a rough-edged, scratched-up gasp for air under waves of deep blue jazz. For a moment there, as he admits “I think I’ve been wrong enough to know when I’m right, ” we forget the smiling press shots long enough to let one heartstring snap.
Tapping into this secret, char-
coa
led sadness will almost certainly 
garner success beyond his 10,000-plus MySpace fans. He’s already won the Y ahoo! Music users’-choice award, and his clap-happy single “Rock and Roll” recently reached No. 11 on VH1’s Top 20 Countdown. Just maybe, if he can sink a little dark-er in
to the caverns of his self-pro-
cl
aimed “acoustic soul, ” Hutchinson 
might one day be selling just as many UCSD-rack Valentine’s compilations as the olden-day idols he so esteems.

■ Skin of Evil
SOFT ABUSE
Pressing play on Carey Mercer’s second solo album Skin 
of Evil feels almost shamefully invasive, like stumbling 
upon something you weren’t meant to witness. It’s a 
dirty, shivering comedown from Mercer’s work with his band Frog Eyes — still gothic but more desperate and scat-te
red, a collage of riffs stolen from blues and baroque pop to 
noise, whirled into sensational chaos.
It opens with a pulsating, trance-inducing beat that ebbs 
and rises throughout the album, reappearing erratically and without warning. Each impulsive track is virtually indistin-gu
ishable from the last, as Mercer never quite reveals where 
one ends and the next begins.
It’ s not that Skin of Evil is repetitive; its compositions are 
simply unconstrained by numbers. The album lets us forget its identity as a collection of recordings and becomes noth-in
g more than a mood, a glimpse of experience to which 
Mercer is allowing us privvy. His work could be classified as experimental or conceptual, but that wouldn’t do justice to the album’ s complete departure from familiar compositional techniques. Its hallucinogenic, echoing guitars sweep in and out, reaching crescendo before slipping away, coming back to life in the form of Mercer’ s haunting voice. He comes to us from somewhere far away, eerie cries building to deep wailing. Like a phantom wanderer wearing the haggard scars of a man long imprisoned, he bemoans  a life misled and deeds better 
l
eft undone. At times, lyrics froth over into the stormy, non-
se
nsical mutterings of a schizophrenic plotting murder. 
Without his bandmates to counsel him, Skin of Evil  
fi
nds Mercer pervaded by a heavy sadness; voices and their 
echoes and uncertain beats swirl into a painful and troubled density that only its creator could understand. For the rest of us, though, that isolation proves arresting, captivating and remarkably unresolved.

White Lies
■ To Lose My Life
POLYDOR
The new incarnation of London trio White Lies attempts to recall the darker side of UK post-punk, in the merg-in
g of dark church organs and overwrought synths 
with a thundering backdrop of bass. A brooding Harry McVeigh recalls his adolescence with aching desolation; ghoulish murder tales and allegories are underscored with the most dramatic of their compositions, as a frozen apoca-ly
pse catapults us far into the depths of disco.
“I love the feeling when we lift off/ Watching the world 
so small below/ I love the dreaming when I think of/ The safety in the clouds out my window” chides the tortured Brit with a dreamlike stupor on “Death, ” summoning us into his chilling nightmare.
Raw instrumentation is soon swapped for the slick pro-
du
ction on title track “To Lose My Life, ” with a sparkling 
reverb lending the London trio a hollow industrialism. The title track shakes with doom, gloom and swirling, razor-sharp guitars, unabashedly borrowing from contemporaries in the likes of the Editors, Franz Ferdinand and the Killers. By the halfway mark, the trio’s repeated crescendos start to grind a little too formulaic, a subdued tension always on the cusp of spilling over into unadulterated revelation, but never quite achieving that release. The finales predictably buzz with moody, wistful synths and crashing drums. 
The one exception to the torment is “Unfinished 
Business. ” Sunnily strumming to an upbeat, tightly wound thump, McVeigh menacingly demands, “Get off your low/ Let’s dance like we used to. ” But even where White Lies try to pick up the pace, they certainly leave unfinished business in refining their brand beyond the ease of emulation.

and a superhero can be found in 
Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner. Since taking over from Matt Leinart in the preseason, Warner has put together a remarkable year. With wide receivers Larry Fitzgerald, Anquan Boldin and the emergence of Steve Breaston — along with a strong running game led by young running backs Tim Hightower and J.J. Arrington and the experienced Edgerrin James — the Cardinals had all the elements needed to be an offensive powerhouse. However, it was Warner who pulled everything together, solidifying a spot in the Hall of Fame with one more great season, even though his enshrinement was previously far from a hot topic. 
However, the Batman analogy 
does not really hold up when it comes to Warner’s success story; whereas the quarterback went from super-ma
rket bag boy to two-time League 
MVP , Bruce Wayne was already a rich mofo before he went off to get some training, and came back to clean up the streets better than McNulty on “The Wire. ”
The Fitzgerald/Boldin duo might 
serve as a better superhero tandem. Fitzgerald has quietly evolved into the best receiver in the game. Like Marvin Harrison in his prime, other receivers get more talk time and hype, but it’s Fitzgerald who constantly comes through. Boldin is an equally impressive player, perhaps more so, considering that he was a second-round pick with one of the greatest rookie seasons ever by a receiver, and continued to excell even when All-World talent Fitzgerald joined the team. Furthermore, Boldin was able to make the Pro Bowl even after having a plate inserted into his face.
Boldin has suffered some criti-
cism 
lately for seemingly walking out 
on the NFC Championship celebra-tio 
n because he was angry about his lack of inclusion. This role of mis-under 
stood superstar only furthers 
the comparison to Batman, another hero without the credit he deserves. The problem with a receiver is that someone else has to deliver him the ball. Batman went to Hong Kong and brought back Lau all on his own, because unlike Keyshawn Johnson, Batman doesn’t need anyone to get him the damn ball — he just takes it.
Looking at the Steelers, the quar-
terb
ack is once again the most obvi-
ou
s target for comparison. After all, 
Pittsburgh QB Ben Roethlisberger and Batman both love riding motor-cy
cles, though Batman is at least smart 
enough to wear a helmet not to men-tio 
n a bulletproof suit. Roethlisberger 
is a good, young quarterback, and undoubtedly can set himself ahead of Rivers and Manning as the best of the 2004 QB class with a second Super Bowl win. However, Hines Ward was the MVP of the first Super Bowl, and even if Big Ben is named MVP after this game, few would argue that he’s been the most valuable player on his team.
What the Steelers deem most 
valuable is instead their defense. Y es, Troy Polamulu’s hair more closely resembles the Joker than anything, but this is a strong, disciplined unit, whereas there probably will never be another person, performance, or acid trip comparable to the craziness of Heath Ledger as the Joker. While the Steelers’ defense does not conjure up that same status as an all-time great unit, with Polamulu and linebacker James Harrison leading the way, this defense can still be scary good.
The old adage is that defense 
wins championships, and the last time that a great offensive and great defensive team met, another vet-er
an QB Rich Gannon was inter-
ce
pted into oblivion. The Cardinals’ 
defense has played remarkably well throughout the postseason, includ-in
g a humiliation of Panther Jake 
Delhomme and a first-half beat-do 
wn of Eagles’ Donovan McNabb. 
The Steelers’ defense, while hold-in 
g up in wins over San Diego and 
Baltimore, has yet to pull off the same kind of spectacle. However, maybe the most important com-pa
rison is not between a team or 
its players as Batman, but between the Cardinals’ defense and Two-Face. While putting the pressure on Delhomme, McNabb and Matt Ryan in the playoffs, Arizona also allowed over 30 points to be scored five times during the season, including 56 to the Jets, 48 to the Eagles and 47 to the Patriots. The Arizona defense offers a scary side to the Cardinals’ feel-good coin. 
No doubt an Arizona win would 
continue the tradition the Giants started last year of exhilarating upsets, and meanwhile provide a perfect end to the season for a surprising, excit-ing 
team and a likable quarterback. 
Unfortunately, that quarterback is a fumble-prone target for the Steelers, who may not be flashy but know how to win. 
The Cardinals might be the cham-
pio
n the Super Bowl deserves, but not 
the ones it needs right now.

The practice round before com-
pe
tition would have allowed players 
to gauge the difficulty of the course — especially the greens —  and 
a 
llowed for the golfers to make nec-
ess
ary adjustments. Less-than-ideal 
weather conditions further compli-ca 
ted play.
“It was really windy and really 
cold, ” Samra said. “It was tough con-di 
tions not only for us, but for the 
other teams too. The fast greens were giving everyone trouble in that first round. ”
After becoming familiar with the 
course in the first round, Samra fired a 2-over  par 74 in the second, the 
t
hird lowest score in the competi-
ti
on.
Sophomore Keith Okasaki saw 
similar progress, improving nearly 10 strokes from his first round score by the end of the second  round.
“This was our first tourna-
me 
nt since October, ” Samra said. 
“Personally, it is a little different get-ti 
ng back into the flow … We’re dis-
ap
pointed with how we played, but 
we just need to get going again. ”
Finally warming up after the long 
break from competition, the team will now shift its focus onto the Cal State San Marcos Invitational in February,  with hopes of improving 
o
n a middle-of-the-pack, 10th place 
finish at last year’s invitational.
“We’re going to go out to the Buck 
[Invitational] and learn how its done — lick our wounds and learn from our mistakes, ” Wydra said.

The match began to unravel for 
the outnumbered UCSD players in the second period, as the Cougars scored a quick goal within the first two minutes to take a 4-2 lead, capitalizing on the tired Triton lines. Unlike during the first period, the Cougars dominated the time of posession in the second, relent-ly
 pushing the puck up to UCSD’ s goal. 
Gilmore connected on the only Triton goal while the Cougars added five more scores before the second intermission. 
“Our short bench took a toll on us, ” 
junior captain Casey Gong said. “W e only had two lines and they had four lines — that was the biggest difference in the game. ”In complete control of the contest, 
the Cougars took a 9-4 lead into the third period. One of the very few bright spots for the Tritons in the game was Gilmore’ s first career hat trick, account-in
g for most of UCSD’ s goals.
“Jackson is usually a defender but 
it was one of those games when we needed a veteran to step up and he did, ” Gong said.
UCSD was plagued with injuries 
and ineligibilities all season, resulting in a disappointing 3-10 record.
“It was a rough season but we’re not 
losing too many players so next season should be better, ” Gong said.

‘DARK KNIGHT’
When the Academy Award 
nominations were announced, I was left a 
little saddened not because I’m judg-ing 
the films that were nominated for 
Best Picture; rather, I feel remorse for a film that wasn’t nominated and should have been. 
There was only one movie that left 
me with the notion of what an award-winning movie should be. (Actually, there were two, but I think my enjoy-men
t of “Pineapple Express” might 
have been due to other factors.) 
The film I’m speaking of is “The 
Dark Knight, ” the new Batman movie — no, not the one with Martin Lawrence as a medieval knight. Now, since this is technically a sports col-umn, I 
won’t go on a long rant about 
why “The Dark Knight” deserved to be nominated; instead, it seems only fitting to compare the two Super Bowl teams — the Arizona Cardinals and Pittsburgh Steelers — to the film, perhaps helping me to make a Super Bowl XLIII prediction.

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL  — Coming off 
a winless week, the Tritons looked to turn their momentum around against UC Irvine and UCLA on the road. Unfortunately, they failed to squeeze out a victory against either UC pow-er
house.
On Jan. 23 at the Pauley Pavilion 
in Los Angeles, the team faced another daunting task, this time against the No. 8 UCLA Bruins. UCLA pulled out no stops, handing the Tritons their second sweep of the week. The sets came out 30-26, 35-33  and 30-22 in UCLA ’ s favor, 
a
s the Bruins cruised to victory.
Despite the loss, a few Tritons posted 
solid individual efforts, including junior opposite hitter Frank Fritsch, who fin-is
hed with an impressive 20 kills on .552 
hitting. Ehrman chipped in with 10 kills and Leserman added seven digs.
Sophomore setter Phil Bannan lent 
40 assists, while sophomore middle back Calvin Ross and Fritsch contrib-ut
ed three blocks apiece.
UCLA was led by junior outside hit-
te
r Garrett Muagututia at 15 kills, while 
freshman opposite hitter Kyle Caldwell and freshman quick hitter Thomas Amberg added 10 kills each.
With the loss, the Tritons drop to 
1-4 overall, and 0-3 in the Mountain Pacific Sports  Federation, while UCLA improves to 3-4, 2-2 MPSF .
On Jan. 21, the Tritons traveled to 
Irvine for a tough match at Crawford Court against the Anteaters. UCSD defeated the 2007 National Champion Anteaters twice in 2008, but could not seem to handle them W ednesday night: While UC Irvine hit a .517 clip, the Tritons managed a measly .218.
The opening set was the tightest of 
the evening for the Tritons, who pulled to within 17-15 after a kill by redshirt sophomore outside hitter Will Ehrman. A kill from sophomore outside hitter Joel Davidson pulled the Tritons to within two, but the Anteaters quickly opened up a six-point advantage and finished the set with a 30-24 win.
The second set was commanded by 
UC Irvine, with the Anteaters jumping out to a 22-16 lead. The Tritons were unable to come back, and Irvine cruised to a 30-22 victory. In the third set, the Tritons and Anteaters were tied at six, until UC Irvine went on a tear to score seven straight points for a 13-7 lead. UCSD never recovered and UC Irvine easily won the final set 30-19.
“W e’ve been going through a rough 
patch, both in terms of how we were playing as a team and the teams we were playing against, ” Ehrman said. “Irvine played awesome ... but we just didn’t bring it. For us to beat a team like that, we have to play our best. ”
Sophomore outside hitter Joel 
Davidson led the losing Tritons with 10 kills on .353 hitting, while sophomore middle back Calvin Ross added eight  
ki
lls on .727 hitting. Senior libero Eric 
Leserman finished with a team-high five digs.
“When we play league games, those 
teams are the best teams [in the nation], ” Davidson said of UCSD’ s elite competi-ti
on. “The thing that Coach Ring always 
says is that we can’t look at UC San Diego as just a Division-II school. W e have to look at it like [UC Irvine] is a  team and we’re a team and we just have to play. Once you’re on the court it’ s pretty easy to do that. ”
After a tough four-game road trip, 
the Tritons returned  home on Jan. 28, hoping to turn their season around against Princeton University. Scores were not available at press time.

CLUB SPORTS  — A season filled with 
disappointments and unfortunate cir-cu 
mstances has fittingly ended in frus-
tr
ation for the UCSD club ice hockey 
team. College of the Canyons handed the Tritons an 11-5 defeat at UTC Ice T own on Jan. 24 one night after UCSD was shut out in a 12-0 loss to San Diego State University. The two losses came after a promising weekend in which the Tritons came out victorious against Cal State Sacramento on Jan. 16 and UC Davis on Jan. 17. 
“Coming into the final games, we 
were trying to play smart defense and not take too many penalties, ” junior captain Casey Gong said. “W e had a couple players hurt and knew it was going to be tough. ”
After the demoralizing loss to 
SDSU, the Tritons came out strong against College of the Canyons look-in
g to finish the season on a high 
note. With 16:19 left in the first period, senior defender Jackson Gilmore got UCSD on the board first, breaking the scoreless streak that lasted through-ou
t the Tritons’ game with the Aztecs. 
College of the Canyons answered back with a goal of their own and looked to take the lead on a breakaway, but junior goaltender Matt Hager preserved the tie with a solid save for the Tritons. 
After UCSD took a 2-1 lead with 
seven minutes left to play in the first period, the Cougars racked up two quick goals to take a 3-2 lead and looked to add on at the end of the period. However, UCSD put together two timely stops in the last minute of the first to close out the period trailing By Matt Croskey

MEN’S GOLF  — After a nearly 
three-month hiatus from competi-ti 
on, the UCSD men’s golf team fin-
is
hed fifth in the second annual San 
Diego Collegiate Classic on Jan. 26.
The Tritons posted a team total of 
635, 30 strokes behind overall win-ne 
r University of San Diego. Junior 
Raj Samra, senior Ryan Bailey and junior Austin Alfonso all fired 161 two-round totals to lead for UCSD.
While this was not the start they 
wanted, head coach Mike Wydra was happy his team gained the experi-en
ce against Division-I schools.
“That kind of competition will 
serve us well in our next tourna-me 
nt, ” he said.  
In a battle royale of sorts among 
the collegiate golf teams of San Diego, Samra said it was a great opportunity to feel out the local competition.
“On a better day, we can compete 
with them, ” Samra  said. “I’ve known 
S
DSU and USD have good teams, 
and it was fun to see how we com-pa 
red. ”
Without the luxury of a practice 
round, the Tritons struggled on the greens in round one. Alfonso led the Tritons with a 6-over 78 while Samra fired an uncharacteristically high 87. M. GOLF
