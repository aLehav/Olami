In an effort to solve urban parking 
and traffic challenges, UCSD and the 
City of San Diego announced their 
participation in the White House’s 
Smart Cities Initiative and their plan 
to join the MetroLab Network on Sept. 
14, 2015. 
San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer 
believes that this opportunity will yield 
great results for the city.
“San Diego leads in research and 
innovation, and this will capitalize on 
UC San Diego’s academic resources 
to create real-world solutions that 
improve the lives of city residents, ” 
Faulconer told UCSD News Center. “The MetroLab Network is a great 
opportunity to increase collaboration 
between the educational and 
civic worlds, and I’m excited                                            
to see the results. ”
The the Network’s strategy is 
to increase partnerships between 
universities and their respective cities 
in order to research, develop and 
utilize new technologies and solve 
major challenges facing the cities.
UCSD Chancellor Pradeep K. 
Khosla stated that university officials 
are optimistic about this opportunity.  
“We look forward to working with 
the mayor and local communities to 
tackle our common challenges and 
improve city services, ” Khosla said in a 
press release. “ At UC San Diego, we are 
committed to advancing knowledge and creating new technology for the 
benefit of our society. ”
UCSD Vice Chancellor for 
Research Sandra A. Brown said that 
both cities and universities would 
benefit from this initiative. 
“Our public university’s mission 
includes service to our community, ” 
Brown said in the press release. “The 
MetroLab Network arising from the 
White House’s Smart Cities Initiative 
gives both partners the opportunity to 
solve mutual problems. ”
In addition to the partnership 
between the City of San Diego and 
UCSD, there are partnerships between 
20 more cities and 25 universities that 
will serve as the founding members AROUND CAMPUS
UC Regents Approve East 
Campus Housing Project
The UC Board of Regents Committee on 
Grounds and Buildings authorized a project to 
build new housing for UCSD graduate students 
and professionals in East Campus during the Board’s 
meetings held at UC Irvine earlier this month. The new 
housing facilities will be located at the Mesa Residential 
Apartments in UCSD’s East Campus.
The Committee plans to use a budget of $208 million 
to replace 88 of the existing units with 1,350 new ones. 
The plan targets 11 46-year-old two-story buildings 
and calls for their demolition. The construction of the 
five new, eight-story-high buildings is expected to be 
complete by 2017.
HDH Assistant Vice Chancellor Mark Cunningham 
discussed how more housing will contribute to an 
improvement in student life.
“It is the university’s belief that this project can be 
transformative for UC San Diego and our graduate 
and professional students in many ways for many years to come,” Cunningham said. “Providing 
additional on-campus housing for our current 
graduate and professional students now living 
off campus or for incoming graduate students 
supports our campus Strategic Plan, as this project 
assists in the recruitment of more graduate and 
professional students and will enhance the student 
life of existing graduate students. ”
Cunningham added that the location of the new 
housing buildings will foster an environment on 
campus that is beneficial to graduate students. 
“By locating this housing within the existing graduate 
and professional neighborhood, we will enable an 
additional 1,350 students to join their colleagues living 
there now to build a new, more vibrant and engaged 
student-centered community which will be tailored to 
their specific needs and wants, ” Cunningham said.

MTS DealLOCAL
Metropolitan Transit System 
gave naming rights to UCSD 
for a future trolley line for $30 
million without public input.

See  MTS , page 3San Diego community leaders 
recently criticized the San Diego 
Metropolitan Transit System for selling 
the naming rights of its future trolley 
line to UCSD, arguing that it failed 
to represent the community’s interests 
during negotiations. In response to the 
backlash, MTS agreed to present its 
proposal to the community soon and 
consider public feedback.
UCSD and MTS agreed to a $30 
million deal in July, granting the 
university the right to name the trolley 
line the “UC San Diego Blue Line” and 
to name three of its stations.
Janay Kruger, chairwoman of the 
University Community Planning 
Group, told the UCSD Guardian that 
the university should not be allowed 
to name stations that do not travel to 
their campus.
“The trolley goes to more than 
UCSD, ” Kruger said. “They shouldn’t 
name the stations after anything 
other than geographical locations or 
something iconic that’s nearby. ”
According to the San Diego Union-
Tribune, UCSD will name the Old 
Town station the “Old Town UC San 
Diego Health Campus South, ” which 
Kruger stated would be confusing for 
passengers, since the hospital is miles 
away from the station. 
MTS Spokesperson Rob Schupp 
responded to Kruger’s claim by 
explaining that “Old Town Station” 
will still be the station’s primary name 
and that transportation to the hospital 
will be available.
“The thought that MTS riders will 
be confused by renaming the Old Town 
station is also unfounded, ” Schupp told 
the Guardian. “The station will always 
be referred to as the Old Town Station. 
Entry monument signs will include 
“UC San Diego Health — Hillcrest” 
as secondary identification. UC San 
Diego also provides shuttle service to 
its Hillcrest medical facility from the 
Old Town station. ”
In addition to naming, the deal 
makes UCSD the line’s exclusive 
research, education and health care 
advertiser. This allows the university to 
place its logo on one-way tickets, trolley 
maps, station signs and schedules, as 
well as on any major advertisements 
wrapped around the trolley cars. 
UCSD will also have the right to place 
advertisements on the rail bridges over 
Interstate 5 and Genesee Avenue. 
Kruger stated that her planning 
group considers signage to be “clutter” 
and thus wants to keep it to a minimum. 
Schupp assured the Guardian that the 
residential community will be exposed 
to signage as infrequently as possible.
“ Almost all of the signage that 
includes UC San Diego Blue Line 
branding will be visible only to trolley UCSD and San Diego Join MetroLab Network

@asucsdUCSD’s department of 
psychology published the results of 
one of its studies on Sept. 9 that 
suggests a possible detrimental effect 
of mindfulness meditation: false-
memory recollection. 
UCSD psychology graduate 
student Brent Wilson discussed the 
interest in studying mindfulness 
meditation and in the possible 
negative consequences of the exercise.
“Our results highlight an 
unintended consequence of 
mindfulness meditation: memories 
may be less accurate, ” Wilson said 
to Psychological Science, the journal 
in which the study was published. 
“This is especially interesting 
given that previous research has 
primarily focused on the beneficial 
aspects of mindfulness training and 
mindfulness-based interventions. ”
Mindfulness has a pervasive 
presence, with celebrities like Oprah 
Winfrey lauding the practice. Its 
touted benefits include better 
psychological well-being and decreased depression in older adults, 
and a reduction in pain intensity for 
people with chronic pain. 
The research team explored how 
the cognitive processes associated 
with mindfulness affected how 
people remembered events as 
either originating from their 
imaginations or from reality. In the 
course of their study, they found 
that practicing mindfulness tended 
to lead to an increase in confusion                         
between the two.
“When memories of imagined 
and real experiences too closely 
resemble each other, people can 
have difficulty determining which 
is which, and this can lead to falsely 
remembering imagined experiences 
as actual experiences, ” Wilson said.
The research team investigated 
the cognitive processes involved 
in mindfulness and its potential to 
affect memory by preparing a series 
of three experiments, each using a 
slightly different approach.
The first two experiments 
employed the widely used method 
of false memory testing known as 
the Deese-Roediger-McDermott 
paradigm. This method presents a list of closely-related words to the 
subject, and then asks the subject 
to identify whether or not a word 
(which was not presented but is 
related to the other words) was on 
the list. In UCSD’s study, the words 
presented revolved around garbage 
but did not include the word “trash” 
— which subjects were asked about.
The first experiment separated 
participants into two groups: 
one practicing mindfulness, and 
one practicing mind-wandering 
exercises. The mindfulness exercise 
included watching a guided, 
focused-breathing exercise clip, 
while the mind-wandering exercise 
instructed individuals to think 
about anything that came to mind. 
Each group practiced its respective 
technique for 15 minutes, and then 
was tested using the DRM paradigm.
Of the mindfulness participants, 
29 percent failed the paradigm 
while only 20 percent of the mind-
wandering participants failed. 
The second experiment used 
DRM lists by having participants 
view words on a computer screen 
for 1.5 seconds at a time. After 
completely viewing the list, they were tasked with typing back all of the               
words they remembered.
A greater portion of the 
mindfulness participants than the 
mind-wandering participants failed 
in the second experiment as well.
The third experiment used the 
second experiment’s method on 
a larger scale, with 100 words in 
random order and testing both before 
and after the mindfulness exercise.
This time, the mindfulness 
participants accurately recognized 
the words that they actually saw, 
but had a greater chance of falsely 
identifying related words after the 
mindfulness exercise.
Wilson noted that the results of 
the findings confirmed the increase 
in false recollection and confusion 
of memories.
“ As a result, the same aspects 
of mindfulness that create 
countless benefits can also have the 
unintended negative consequence 
of increasing false-memory 
susceptibility, ” Wilson said.SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
Meditation Technique Adversely Impacts Memory Retention
Researchers conducted three experiments that linked practicing mindfulness meditation with false recollection.

Sage Schubert Christian, Katie Pottsof the MetroLab Network. The goals 
of the Network include establishing 
and organizing a series of workshops 
between the founding partners, as well 
as appointing an executive director to 
manage the Network.
Funding for this project 
is supported by the John D. and 
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and a grant from the National 
Science Foundation. 
MacArthur Foundation’s 
Program Officer Alaina Harkness 
told UCSD News Center that she 
hopes the partnerships formed in 
this Network will boost the cities’ 
connectivity and functionality. 
“The MetroLab Network will 
catalyze research, development 
and demonstration projects that will benefit urban residents, 
environments and communities,” 
Harkness said. “Working together, 
the Network partners will pool 
knowledge, share resources and 
boost their collective ability to make 
cities work better. ”riders, ” Schupp said. “Entry signage 
to the two stations on campus will 
be visible only to UC San Diego 
audiences. The few permanent 
signs on bridges will be vetted                                                   
with the community. ”
Schupp explained that factoring 
public opinion into the naming process 
would complicate the negotiating 
aspect of deals.
“Sponsorship negotiations are 
almost always done privately, ” Schupp 
said. “It would be virtually impossible to successfully negotiate a deal in the 
public realm. ”
Joe LaCava, chair of the San Diego 
Community Planners Committee, 
responded that MTS should have 
spoken to the public prior to the start 
of negotiations so that they could 
properly represent their interests.
“They should have come out in 
advance and talked about the options 
and talked about the necessity of 
raising revenue, ” LaCava said. “Prior 
to releasing the request or proposal, 
that’s when you engage the public and 
develop a policy about what is going to be on the table. ”
Schupp stated that MTS is going to 
have reach out to the community soon 
about the features of the deal and show 
them models of the signs. 
“We have committed to present 
to community groups any permanent 
signage that is visible to the community, ” 
Schupp said. “We will do a better job of 
communicating potential deals with 
appropriate stakeholders in advance of 
a decision. ”Kruger, however, told the UCSD 
Guardian that constructing new 
residential buildings should not be 
the Committee’s first priority.
“[There is a] need for a [new] fire 
station, ” Kruger said. “Fire station 35 
made 5,802 calls last year, [and] over 
2,000 of them were to the campus. ”
Kruger added that traffic in 
nearby areas would become even 
more crowded with the completion 
of the project.
“ All traffic that will have to use 
Regents Road is already impacted, ” 
Kruger continued. “The city will be widening Regents Road, but we can’t 
just keep widening roads. Traffic is a 
very major issue. [...] It was a back-
room deal without community input. ”
The Committee claims that the 
cost of repairs to restore the old 
units instead of replacing them 
would already cost upward of $31 
million to justify the finances of the 
project. The age of the buildings 
also creates a safety issue for the 
occupants, due to the lack of fire-life 
safety and sprinklers.
Cunningham commented that 
the project was a necessity for the 
increasing demand for on-campus 
housing from graduate students.“Currently, we have a record high 
waitlist of just under 2,000 graduate 
and professional students wanting to 
live in university-provided housing, 
and we know that number will 
continue to increase, ” Cunningham 
said. “Thus, it is evident the project 
is meeting the high demand from 
graduate students for campus 
housing. ”  
In addition to the new buildings, 
Caltrain is going to construct a new 
bridge over Interstate 5 to link Gilman 
Drive and Medical Center Drive. NEW S  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , SEPTEMBER 28, 2015 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  3

10,000 Syrian 
Refugees is a 
Good Start; 
Let’s Do More
If the United States is really the 
so-called “land of the free, ” you’ d 
expect legislation to push for 
more refugees to be accepted into 
the country. This would make sense 
considering this great country was 
almost exclusively built on immigrants 
from oppressed populations. President 
Obama announced on Sept. 10 that he 
wanted to increase the limit for Syrian 
refugees to the U.S. from a mere 
5,000 to 10,000. This would raise the 
U.S. annual limit of 70,000 refugees 
coming from all over the world to 
75,000. This is a good start, but far 
more refugees will need a safe place 
to live.
For starters, the BBC reported that 
the United Nations, over which the 
U.S. holds significant power, declared 
that “EU nations must accept up to 
200,000 refugees as part of a ‘common 
strategy’ to replace their ‘piecemeal’ 
approach to the migrant crisis. ” That’s 
a pretty big number, considering none 
of the European powers come close to 
having the same capacity that the U.S. 
has to integrate new migrants. 
The U.S. ’s efforts are already 
ridiculously inadequate next to the 
strain Europe has to face during this 
migrant crisis, but when you compare 
it to the Middle East, it becomes 
downright laughable.
The Intercept reported that 
“Jordan has taken 630,000 [refugees], 
many of whom languish in desert 
camps along the border with Syria. 
Another 1.8 million Syrians have 
settled in Turkey, which has no 
intention of providing permanent 
homes for either Kurds or Arabs 
from Syria. Astoundingly, 250,000 
Syrians have fled to Iraq despite the 
war there. ” It says something when 
250,000 Syrians prefer going to a war-
torn Iraq over staying in Syria. Also, 
Iraq is accepting Syrian refugees at a 
50-to-1 rate compared to the U.S. Just 
think about that.
In this catastrophic scenario, one 
country has once again emerged as 
the example to follow in all refugee-
related crises: Jordan, whose queen 
is a former Kuwait refugee from the 
first Gulf War. “Over the last 12 years, 
Jordan has become home to more 
than half a million Iraqis, ” according 
to CNN. “Before the U.S.-led invasion 
and the Iraqi exodus of 2003, Jordan 
took in Palestinian refugees in 
1948 and 1967. They were granted 
Jordanian citizenship, and today it is 
estimated that more than half of the 
country’s population is of Palestinian 
origin. More recently, Jordan’s stability 
in a turbulent region has once again 
turned the country into a sanctuary 
for those fleeing violence. Over the 
past four years, Jordan has opened its 
doors to 1.4 million Syrian refugees 
displaced by the civil war engulfing 
the country. ”
Of course, this is not to say 
that this integration has happened 
without any problems. The U.N. 
has stopped sending aid to Syrian 
refugees in Jordan because it is low 
on cash, and Jordan’s economy is 
still suffering from the high influx of 
new refugees, a result of the wars in 
neighboring countries. 
Before we raise our arms to the 
skies while chanting the merits of 
Obama’s new announcement to 
accept more refugees, let’s remind 
everyone that some countries in 
this region are the real heroes of the 
Syrian refugee crisis.The CEO of  a pharmaceutical 
company raised the price of  an

ILLUSTRA TION   B Y JENNA  MCCLOSKEY
That Republicans are threatening to shut down the government 
over a contrived abortion scandal is laughable. This threat by the 
Republicans shows that, in 2015 and on the backheel of Donald 
Trump’s absolutely sexist campaign, basic healthcare for women 
in the one of the most developed countries in the world is not a 
necessity or a priority — all of this because of alleged misconduct by 
doctors during and after abortion procedures.
The whole scandal about doctors selling fetal parts after abortions 
already stands on very shaky ground, as it was proven over and over 
again that the videos taken were over-edited and did not even come 
close to confirming the revolting headlines anti-abortion groups 
were putting forward. But this is not and has never really been 
about abortion. House Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colorado) points 
out, “In fact, there were over 4 million visits to Planned Parenthood 
clinics last year, and over 90 percent of this was basic women’s 
healthcare and not abortions. ” She also says that federal funds have 
generally not been supportive of Planned Parenthood’s abortion 
services and have instead been focusing on healthcare services. This 
shows that, through the exaggeration of Planned Parenthood as an 
abortion machine, conservatives are overlooking its significance as a 
healthcare provider for women.
This threat to shut down the government is futile, and this 
issue should never have turned into a political face-off. Planned 
Parenthood Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens said, “ At least 
78 percent of Planned Parenthood patients live with incomes at or 
below 150 percent of the federal poverty level — the equivalent of 
about $36,000 a year for a family of four in 2015. ” Clearly, the bill 
planning to defund Planned Parenthood would majorly impact 
already impoverished communities and impede their access to 
affordable health care.
Defunding Planned Parenthood is not an opposition between two 
ideological views. This is all due to an overblown pseudo-political 
scandal that tries to overshadow the fact that Planned Parenthood 
has done more for women in America than any Republican 
administration ever did.

Senior Staff WriterPlanned Parenthood Controversy is a Pseudo-Political 
Scandal, Ignoring its Importance as a Healthcare Provider
QUICK TAKESTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES RECENTLY APPROVED A BILL TO STRIP FUNDING FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD. 
LAST THURSDAY, THE SENATE VOTED AGAINST THESE EFFORTS TO DEFUND THE WOMEN’S HEALTHCARE GROUP .
After the recent expose on Planned Parenthood by a group of 
anti-abortion activists, people were forced to confront the result of 
an abortion: fetal tissue. Instead of tackling the moral conundrum of 
abortions, let’s focus on the current allegation that Planned Parenthood 
may profit off of fetal tissue. It is a frightening possibility that the culture 
surrounding fetal tissue could change into a business model based on 
monetary growth. 
Besides seeming unethical, it is illegal. The Health Revitalization 
Act of 1993 states in Sec. 498B that “it shall be unlawful to knowingly 
acquire, receive or otherwise transfer any human fetal tissue for valuable 
consideration if the transfer affects interstate commerce. ” This makes 
sense because a woman’s ability to produce fetal tissue should not be 
exploited for financial gain. On the other hand, it is perfectly legal for 
women to make a donation of fetal tissue.
In videos made against Planned Parenthood, pro-life activists claim 
that fetal tissue is being illegally sold for a profit. In one of the videos, a 
representative for Planned Parenthood said that each fetus usually ranges 
from $30 to $100. This may seem like a lot of money, but remember 
that it is only illegal if the tissue is being transferred for “valuable 
consideration. ” According to Sec. 498B of the law, for fetal tissue to be 
defined as “valuable consideration, ” the price must exceed all reasonable 
payments necessitated by the processes of transportation, preservation, 
quality control, implantation or storage of fetal tissue. However, it is 
difficult to pinpoint exactly where these expenses should be capped. 
Unfortunately, the line between “reasonable payments” and “valuable 
consideration” appears to be blurry and difficult to regulate. 
The fight between pro-life and pro-choice advocates is a distraction 
from the real issue. While allegations against Planned Parenthood 
may raise questions about the management of fetal tissue, Planned 
Parenthood also hugely contributes to the prevention of abortions in 
the first place as a provider of healthcare and preventative education. 
Fetal tissue is the result of abortion, but is not the cause. It is important 
to address the cause of abortion — restricted access to preventative 
education and healthcare — rather than obsessing over managing the end 
product of fetal tissue.
—  CASSIA POLLOCK
Opinion EditorThe Real Question Regarding Planned Parenthood: 
Is Human Fetal Tissue Actually Generating a Profit?Health: It is one of the most valuable things we can possess and it 
is also, at times, terrifyingly out of our control. But being at the 
whims of pesky pathogens, happenstance heredity and arbitrary 
accidents is only part of what makes health in the United States such an 
alarmingly erratic affair. The recent “scandal” involving CEO of Turing  
Pharmaceuticals Martin Shkreli is merely a symptom of the real prob -
lem: Our public healthcare system is sick. It is a sickness hinging upon by 
an almost entirely uncontrolled drug market driven primarily by profit. 
It is a sickness we must actively seek to cure, in part by placing a cap in               
prescription drug prices. 
Shkreli, who, according to BBC, has been called a “morally bankrupt 
sociopath, ” a “scumbag, ” a “garbage monster” and “everything that is wrong 
with capitalism, ” is a sort of figurehead for this profiteering marketplace. He 
recently hiked the price of Daraprim, a lifesaving drug used to treat AIDs 
patients, from $13.50 to $750 a pill. 
For some perspective, imagine walking into your local 7/11 to buy a 
bottle of Coca-Cola. From past experience, you expect it to be in the ball -
park of $1.29. But yesterday, Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent decided to raise 
the price of a Coke by the same margin (which comes to be an approximate 5,555-percent increase). Now, to enjoy your carbonated refreshment, you’ll 
be expected to fork out $71.66. $71.66 for a 16-ounce Coca-Cola. The only 
significant difference in this metaphor is that we can all live without sugar 
water, while an AIDs patient cannot live without specific medications. 
Perhaps this analogy seems a bit ridiculous to you. Kent would never 
raise the price of Coca-Cola to over $70. No one would buy it — even the 
most dedicated of Coke drinkers would reluctantly switch over to Pepsi. 
But what options do our AIDs patients have? Can they switch to off-brand      
Daraprim? Stop taking the drugs altogether because they simply can’t afford 
it? Of course not. As journalist Steven Brill mentions in his expose “ Ameri -
ca’s Bitter Pill” , patients cannot even legally obtain the drug from producers 
in Canada, who sell the exact same prescription drugs for 40 to 50 percent 
less than in the U.S. 
This dramatic price decrease is not unique to our neighbors in the north; 
just about every other developed nation controls the prices of monopoly 
drugs, such as Daraprim. Individuals are not the only victims of this           
extortionate drug pricing, either. Brill reported that Medicare — the nation’s 
largest health insurer, handling more than one billion claims per year — also 
has to pay pharmaceutical companies whatever they say their wholesale 
See DRUG CAP , page 5
MARCUS THUILLIER 
& AYAT AMINAcross  the  Globeprice is for drugs, plus an additional 6 
percent. Unfortunately, it will require 
some significant political moving and 
shaking for America to catch up with 
Canada and other such countries.
“It’s a toxic political issue, ” Steven 
Brill said, “because of the fear and 
emotion involved [when it comes to 
human health]. ”
That is, when one’s health is at 
stake, one is liable to do or pay just 
about anything. To make matters 
worse, pharmaceutical companies 
spend a considerable amount of 
money on political lobbyists — 
over $124 million in the year 2015,                     
according to the Center for Responsive Politics — who attempt to maintain 
the status quo, in which individuals 
are forced to pay uncontrolled, exor -
bitant prices for products they literally 
cannot go without. In order to prevent 
corrupt CEOs from jeopardizing a sick 
patient’s access to desperately needed 
medication, there must be a cap on 
prescription prices. 
Presidential candidates Hillary 
Clinton and Bernie Sanders have 
both openly expressed interest in 
policies that erode Big Pharm power, 
in part by making the purchase of 
cheaper, Canadian drugs accessible 
to Americans. Such policies, if 
implemented, are capable of truly 
transforming the healthcare industry 
in the U.S. from what is at present — an unchecked marketplace that 
is nightmarishly confusing and 
exploitative of the consumer. It also 
victimizes nearly everyone other 
than hospital executives, medical 
device makers and drug companies. 
Human health and well-being are 
too important to be left entirely up 
to the free market, particularly in the 
case of prescription drugs. Americans 
deserve access to affordable medical 
treatment, and medical providers 
should not be unable to grant this 
affordability because of an unbounded 
pharmaceutical marketplace and 
greedy CEOs like Martin Shkreli.OPINION  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , SEPTEMBER 28, 2015 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  5

YOUR COMMUNITY CARES;
ASK FOR THEIR ADVICE.    
At some point, we all need a little advice. With 10 weeks of midterms, public transportation adventures, 
apartment drama and general mayhem looming ahead, we asked people at UCSD for their insight 
on everything from coffee to class schedules. Not just students, but professors, advisors, RSOs and 
housekeepers — and they have comments about all  facets of our UCSD community. 
“One of the most important facts about being a student, right 
here [at UCSD], at one of the best universities in the world, is to 
stay focused. Be obedient to your teachers, be obedient to your 
parents, to the people who work around you and listen to them. 
Stay away from drugs, don’t procrastinate [on] your homework, 
always be on time and more importantly, prioritize your stud -
ies. Y ou can be brilliant because you will have a career [in the 
future]. Right now, there will be many [students] who will try 
to [achieve a career], but there will be few [students] who will 
reach their goals. So try very, very hard everyday. Everyday is a 
struggle — all of us are struggling. I am part of this university 
and I am very proud to be [helping] you to understand that life 
is beautiful, that you are here to make a constructive world. ”
 —  Rudy Mata (Senior Housekeeper)
“One piece of advice that I would give to UCSD 
students is to try to get out of UCSD. Don’t 
just be active within UCSD, but try to be active 
within the community — and that doesn’t mean 
just La Jolla, but San Diego as a whole, because 
there’s so much culture and different people, 
traditions. I always feel like when people come to 
UCSD they just stay here because UCSD in itself 
is a little city, so you really don’t need to leave for 
any reason. So one piece of advice I would give 
is to go out there and explore the city because it 
does have a lot to offer and there are a lot of cool 
sights to see. ”

and Resident Advisor at Revelle College)COMPLIED BY ALLISON KUBO/ FEATURES EDITOR, CEDRIC HYON/ CONTRIBUTING WRITER, SALLY PARK /SENIOR STAFF WRITER, & ALVIN CHAN/ STAFF WRITER

“Don’t leave your friends behind. We don’t 
like finding you on the parking lots or 
lawns by yourselves and passed out. It used 
to happen a lot more a few years ago; there 
haven’t been as many recently, but it still 
does happen. It’s really scary for us to think 
about. If I came out here and found you all 
by yourself; if we find a female out there, 
we don’t know what’s going on or why she’s 
passed. For me, I’m a grandpa and a dad, so 
it scares me when kids are out there. ” 
— Dan Gonzales (RSO)“Try a little bit of everything your 
first year. My first quarter here 
I joined, or at least visited every 
club I heard of. I am only in a few 
of those now, but I really enjoy 
them, and I wouldn’t have found 
them if I hadn’t done so much my 
first year. ”
— Oliver Keaton (Junior, Eleanor 
Roosevelt College)
“We always remind [students] to 
take advantage of all the different 
kinds of resources. There are also lots 
of resources devoted to social and 
personal [issues]. Don’t be afraid to 
ask for help, no matter what kind of 
issue you are having because there is 
probably a department that can help. ”
— Sidney Eads (Asst. Student Affairs 
Officer, Department of Physical 
Sciences)

FREE FOOD AND DRINKSfrom“I personally was a little nervous 
in the beginning because I wasn’t feel -
ing the best, ” Hinkle said. “But as the 
race went on I was able to work with 
my teammates and lock into a rhythm 
and was fortunately able to hold that 
and felt strong up until the end. After 
this very good start, both today and in 
Missouri at pre-nationals last week -
end, I am looking forward to seeing 
what damage my team and [I] can do 
both at the conference meet in San 
Francisco and the nationals meet in 
Missouri. I think the success we have 
had thus far is only a little glimpse of 
what is to come. ”
After Hinkle and Carstens came 
senior Paige Hughes (22:40.10), 
who placed fifth, and  sophomores 
Ella Verhees (23:22.40) and Kristin 
Semancsin (23:30.90), eighth and ninth respectively. 
“My adaptation [to running 
cross-country for UCSD] has been 
pretty easy mostly because my team 
is super awesome, and they have 
helped make the transition a lot eas -
ier, ” Carstens said. “The practices are 
tough, but my team makes them so 
much better and more doable. This 
morning I felt pretty tired mostly 
because we have had a tough couple 
of weeks, and my legs definitely felt 
the hard work. We had a good pack 
up front, and the girls helped me 
push through my fatigue. I’m look -
ing forward to getting more college 
racing experience and making more 
memories with my team. ” 
UCSD came out on top,              
scoring 22 points to CCAA rival 
No. 25 Cal State San Bernardino’s 
34. Claremont-Mudd-Scripps (96), Biola (100), Cal State Los Angeles 
(146), San Bernardino Valley (184) 
and Victor Valley (201) also com -
peted in the event.
“The goal, coming in, was to  
continue our pack running efforts 
and [to keep] the group together, ” 
Garcia told the UCSD Athletics De -
partment. “The women did a great 
job of that with Corinne, Karina and 
Paige getting up in that front group 
right away. We had really good        
support through the back end of the 
second half of the race from the rest 
of our field. ”
Next for UCSD is the 23rd        
Annual Triton Classic held on North 
Campus in two weeks on Saturday, 
Oct. 10.Tritons Take on UC Ir vine on October 1.

of its own by sophomore driver Cole 
Martinez, then sprang to a one-point 
lead with a goal by junior driver Nick 
Alexander in the final seconds of the 
frame. However, LMU returned with a 
vengeance in the second quarter, out -
scoring UCSD 3–1 to regain the lead. 
The Lions could not hold their 
lead, though. The Tritons scored five 
in the third frame and limited LMU 
to just one goal, ending the quar -
ter with a comfortable three-point 
cushion. LMU’s freshman center 
Dayne Jagga then leveled the game 
out with a hat trick in the early min -
utes of the fourth period. Beck fired 
another one home to pull the Lions 
into a one-point lead, but UCSD   
senior utility Chase Cockerill found 
the back of the cage in the final sec -
onds of the game to send the teams 
into overtime. 
“We had a three-goal lead           
going into the fourth quarter. It was 
a learning lesson, though. We acted 
like the game was over and gave up 
goal after goal after goal, ” UCSD 
Head Coach Denny Harper told the 
UCSD Athletics Department. “You can’t give up a three-goal lead like 
that, but they’ll learn. ”
LMU crushed the UCSD                     
defense in the first period of overtime,                
scoring three unanswered goals before 
the Tritons’ senior two-meter Tyler 
Mancuso came back with a shot of his 
own. UCSD trailed by two going into 
the second period of overtime. 
Alexander smashed a penalty shot 
into the cage to start the second frame 
out, then found the target once more 
to close the period at 12–12 and send 
the teams to sudden-death overtime.  
However, a suspenseful six periods 
turned to heartbreak in the seventh 
period of play after junior utility Matt 
Cuozzo sent a shot home to give LMU 
a 13–12 victory. 
“LMU is a championship-caliber 
program, ” Harper said. “It was a great 
game and a great environment. It’s an 
awesome rivalry, and historically for as 
long as we’ve been doing this, anything 
goes in these games. ”
The Tritons will have a week off  
before traveling north to take on UC 
Irvine on Oct. 1.
third-consecutive double-double for 
both Sierks and Wright. 
The first two sets went smoothly 
for the Tritons, as they only faced 
slight trouble with some service er -
ror and what looked like a potential 
comeback from the Toros. The Tri -
tons knew how to clean up, though, 
and came up back on top with an 
invigorated attack. The third set had 
more competition as the offense 
lacked on both sides. But after a late 
service error from the Toros, the Tritons fought back to win it all. 
“Overall I’m really happy with 
our play, ” Dahle told the UCSD 
Athletics Department. “ And it will 
only get better from here, so hope -
fully post-season we will be looking       
our best. ” After a couple of success -
ful games won on their home court, 
the Tritons will travel to Humboldt 
State to take on the Lumberjacks on 
Oct. 1 and the Sonoma State Sea -

The UCSD women’s volleyball team had a successful weekend as it 
took down No. 25 Cal State Los Angeles this past Friday and then 
went on to defeat Cal State Dominguez Hills on the following Satur -
day, with both victories won at home at RIMAC Arena. 
With strong blocking and serving, the Tritons took down Cal State 
Los Angeles’ Golden Eagles with relative ease, winning 3–0. The three sets 
played resulted in scores of 25–17, 25–12 and 25–12. With this well-played 
victory in their hands, the Tritons advanced to a 7–5 overall ranking and a 
3–1 CCAA ranking. 
Game 1
When it came to blocking on Friday night, the Tritons dominated the net, 
out-blocking the Golden Eagles 10–2. The game led to the Tritons having a 
season-high total of five players with multiple blocks: sophomore middle 
blocker Rebecca Seaberry (5), senior middle blocker Kameron Cooper (3), 
sophomore middle blocker Alyssa McNeely (3), senior setter Heidi Sierks 
(3) and senior outside hitter Danielle Dahle (2).
The Tritons’ service game was also at its best as they hit 8–0 over the 
Golden Eagles. Sophomore outside hitter Amanda Colla hit five of those 
serves, and Sierks also put down a pair. 
The outside-hitter duo of junior Meagan Wright and Dahle led the 
Tritons in kills and points once again. They both scored double-doubles, 
with Wright having 12 kills and 14.0 points and Dahle tallying up 11 
kills and 13.5 points. This was Wright’s sixth double-double of the sea -
son, tying her for the team lead. Sierks was on the other side of that lead 
as she scored her sixth double-double of the year, with 27 assists and a 
match-best 15 digs. 
The Tritons were only tied with the Golden Eagles at 11–11 during the 
first set, after which they won in every set and never came in danger of losing. 
This was the Tritons’ fourth victory out of the five previous games, with three of those wins ending in league sweeps. It was also the seventh time that they 
played against a top-25 nationally-ranked team so far this season. 
“The thing I really liked is that we didn’t let up in the match. ... I think 
they were just ready to play tonight because of that loss on Tuesday night 
[against Cal State San Bernardino], ” Head Coach Ricci Luyties told the 
UCSD Athletics Department.
Game 2
The Tritons came in with the heat again the following day as they faced 
off against Cal State Dominguez Hills’ Toros, winning their second-straight 
league sweep as they took another 3–0 victory in the same weekend. 
Now having won five of their previous six matches, UCSD improved to 
an 8–5 overall ranking and a 4–1 CCAA ranking. This tied them for first 
with Cal Poly Pomona and No. 17 Cal State San Bernardino.   
Similar to their success on Friday night, the Tritons played Saturday 
night’s game with a similar mindset, with defense being their key to success. 
The Tritons were able to collect 61 digs compared to the Toros’ 33. They also 
played great-paced offense, finishing off with a considerable 0.250 (47–21–
104) to 0.78 (22–14–103) advantage in hitting percentage. 
Wright led all the players on the court as she recorded her seventh double-
double of the season: She had 14 kills and 10 digs while also scoring 15.5 
points. Wright has scored a double-double in six of her last seven games, 
while also bringing in double-digit kill count in the last 12 of 13 games.  
Dahle wasn’t far behind her teammate, as she was able to notch in her 
sixth double-double before the third set had even started. Dahle brought in 
13 kills and 12 digs, while also hitting .346 (13–4–26). 
Sierks continued the Triton dominance as she also picked up her seventh 
double-double of the season, assisting on 37 kills and 13 digs. This made it the CONTACT THE EDITOR

came in as a pack within 18 seconds 
of each other. Claremont-Mudd-
Scripps came in second place with 
48 points.
“On the men’s side, they had a really specific task of staying                
together early, rolling a conserva -
tive pace and then attack[ing] in 
the final two miles, ” UCSD Head 
Coach Nate Garcia told the UCSD 
Athletics Department. “They did a 
great job with that, and I’m really 
pleased with what they were able to              accomplish today. ”
Senior Corinne Hinkle (22:19.40) 
won the race for the women, just 
a few seconds before her team -
