UC San Diego and Sierra Space 
have established an agreement to 
jointly develop the world's /f_irst 
commercially owned and oper -
ated space station, Orbital Reef. 
Orbital Reef will be a “mixed-
use business park in space in low 
Earth orbit (LEO) for commerce, 
research, and tourism by the end 
of this decade,” according to Sier -
ra Space(include source of quote). 
According to a press release by 
Sierra Space, UCSD will support 
the development and launch by 
“provid[ing] input […] on the de -
sign and concept of operations for 
providing new, state-of-the-art 
biomanufacturing, biofabrication 
and related in-space laboratory 
capabilities and services to indus -
try, academia and government re -
searchers.”
/T_his collaboration between 
Sierra Space and UCSD comes 
at a timely juncture for UCSD’s 
Integrated Space Stem Cell Or -
bital Research team. Two years 
ago, along with their partners at 
Space Tango, UCSD researchers 
at the Sanford Stem Cell Clini -
cal Center at UCSD Health, San -
ford Consortium for Regenera -
tive Medicine received a NASA 
award to develop the world’s /f_irst 
stem cell research laboratory on 
the International Space Station 
(ISS). However, given that NASA 
recently outlined their plans to 
retire the ISS by 2031, this new 
agreement will allow the team to 
continue their exciting research 
beyond the ISS’s closure. 
In a press release, Professor 
of Medicine, Director of the San -
ford Stem Cell Clinical Center at 
UCSD Catriona Jamieson also 
expressed her optimism about the 
unique and valuable research that 
can be conducted in space. 
“Microgravity and radiation 
exposure in low-Earth orbit oﬀers 
a unique opportunity to study 
stem cell aging and pre-cancer 
development in a compressed 
time frame in a manner that is 
unavailable on Earth,” she said. 
Jamieson also went on to ex -
plain how UCSD’s Integrated 
Space Stem Cell Orbital Research 
team has already made promising 
/f_indings in space. /T_hese /f_indings, 
she says, augment our current un -
derstanding of cancer and stem 
cell dysfunction, providing ex -
citing new avenues to explore in 
search of diagnostics and thera -
peutics for cancer and degenera -
tive diseases.

missions carrying stem cells and 
stem cell-derived organoids into

Appeals Court Rules DACA Illegal, Further Jeopardizing 
the Future of  Undocumented People
By Niloufar Shahbandi /gid00015/gid00006/gid00024/gid00020/gid00001/gid00006/gid00005/gid00010/gid00021/gid00016/gid00019
On Oct. 5, a federal appeals court ruled that 
the Obama administration's implementa -
tion of Deferred Action for Childhood Ar -
rivals (DACA) is unlawful. Despite the decision, 
DACA is still in place, but the case has been sent to 
a lower court that will analyze the latest regulations 
released by the Biden administration in August 2022. 
New recipients will not be accepted into the program, 
but existing DACA recipients can still continue to re -
new their status. 
Currently there are 600,000 DACA recipients 
across the U.S., with one in /f_ive of the nation’s un -
documented college students residing in California. 
On Oct. 6, the day following the court’s decision, UC 
President Michael Drake sent an email addressing 
the ruling and stating his dedication to support un -
documented students.
“We are deeply troubled by the Fi/f_th Circuit 
Court of Appeals’ decision, which holds that the 
DACA program violates federal law,” read the email. 
“We remain fully committed to working with Cali -
fornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, Attorney General Rob 
Bonta and our students, faculty, and staﬀ to advocate 
for permanent pathways to citizenship so undocu -
mented Californians can pursue their academic and 
professional goals without fear of deportation.”
Despite such promises, there are limited actions 
states can take, as immigration issues fall under fed -
eral jurisdiction. Associate Professor Tom Wong of 
the political science department talked to /T_he UCSD 
Guardian about what the new ruling means for 
DACA recipients and undocumented people going 
forward. 
“Legally, we’ve seen a predictable pattern where 
DACA wins in some district courts while loses in 
others,” Wong said. “Appointees on the political le/f_t are ruling for DACA while appointees on the po -
litical right are ruling against DACA. So what this 
means is that we’ll most likely see DACA recipients 
and undocumented young people more generally be 
used as political pawns.”
Wong further explained that, despite the current 
challenges, there are ways that President Biden and 
Congress can protect undocumented people. 
“/T_he Biden administration could theoretically 
put in place a new program that provides some form 
of protection to DACA recipients as well as undocu -
mented young people who do not qualify for DACA,” 
Wong said. “Only Congress can pass legislation that 
would provide legal protections for DACA recipients 
and/or a path to citizenship.”
However, with the upcoming midterm elections, 
immigration has taken a back seat for politicians who 
do not wish to state their views on the highly contest -
ed topic. Wong further elaborated on DACA’s status 
among Democratic candidates.
“Democrats who are on the far le/f_t, who are in 
very safe democratic districts may want to talk about 
permanent protections for DACA recipients,” he 
said. “But Democrats who are in contested districts 
likely won’t take up the issue of immigration or will 
try to pivot away from the issue of immigration on 
the campaign trail because it is a hot button issue and 
will push away some moderates to the political right.”
However, such political games come at the ex -
pense of undocumented people. A survey that looked 
at UC and CSU students reported that 50% of undoc -
umented students reported thinking about their par -
ent or guardian’s deportation once a week or more, 
and 38% of students reported thinking about their 
own deportation just as frequently.

FINANCIAL AID
UCSD Requiring Proof  of  Engagement for Financial Aid Disbursement 
By kaitlin lee 
/gid00001/gid00015/gid00006/gid00024/gid00020/gid00001/gid00006/gid00005/gid00010/gid00021/gid00016/gid00019/gid00002/gid00013/gid00001/gid00002/gid00020/gid00020/gid00010/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00015/gid00021
UC San Diego introduced a new monitoring sys -
tem in Summer Session I to track the commencement 
of academic activity for all undergraduate, graduate, 
and professional students, in order to disburse their 
federal /f_inancial aid. /T_his system tracks and reports 
the commencement of academic activity for students 
in each class in each term, including the summer ses -
sions, and regardless of a student’s passing status. As for students who don’t receive Title IV /f_inan -
cial aid, they will not be aﬀected by this policy and 
will not receive an email if they do not commence 
academic engagement.
According to the UCSD Tritonlink site, the U.S. 
Department of Education (ED) began requiring 
universities this summer to track that students have 
started their academic activity in a class so that stu -
dents are eligible for Title IV federal /f_inancial aid.

To address student concerns, 
UC Immigrant Legal Services 
held an Instagram Live hosted 
by Aidin Castillo Mazantini, 
executive director of UC Immi -
grant Legal Services Center and 
Staff Attorney Andres Lemons. 
They discussed the recent rul -
ing and answered student ques -
tions.
“We know there is a lot of 
frustration over what is happen -
ing to DACA and what has been 
happening over the past few 
years,” Castillo said. 
Castillo reiterated the UC’s 
commitment to do everything 
they can to protect DACA.
“We know that the outlook 
for the DACA program isn’t 
great and we know that this is 
now the second court that has 
found that the policy that was 
first announced [in 2012] to be 
unlawful and that the program 
continues to be at risk. There 
are a number of organizations 
and advocates that have and 
continue to be in support of the 
DACA program. That includes 
us, we do everything that we 
can to make sure our students 
are protected. Families under -
stand that we do everything 
within our ability to make sure 
students have the resources and 
protections they need to renew 
DACA.” Castillo added.
Castillo and Lemons encour -
aged students to utilize their 
services as well as explore other 
organizations such as United 
We Dream, who provide re -
sources and advocacy for un -
documented people. 
Since its inception in 2012 
by former President Barack 
Obama, DACA has faced many 
challenges, many of which were 
heightened by the Trump ad -
ministration. In 2017, former 
President Trump announced 
that he would halt the pro -
gram, which he began to phase 
out shortly after taking office. 
Three days after the announce -
ment of DACA’s termination, 
the UC Regents filed a lawsuit, Department of Homeland Secu -
rity v. Regents of the University 
of California, to prevent its dis -
solution. The case was heard by 
the Supreme Court on Nov. 12, 
2019, and in a 5-4 decision, the 
court reversed Trump’s decision 
to rescind the DACA program, 
stating it was “arbitrary and ca -
pricious.” 
While DACA still remains in 
place, more challenges are on its 
way as it awaits the lower court's 
decision on Biden’s new regula -
tions, which are set to take effect 
beginning Oct. 31. White House 
officials are reportedly waiting 
to push for further immigration 
policies following the midterm 
elections.

cancer diagnostics and thera -
peutics that eradicate cancer at 
its earliest stages into addition 
to a broad array of degenera -
tive diseases that arise as a re -
sult of stem cell dysfunction.”
Sierra Space CEO Tom Vice 
also expressed his confidence 
in the collaboration, as well 
as his high hopes for the po -tential clinical applications of 
research conducted on Orbital 
Reef. 
“This agreement with UC 
San Diego is a major break -
through in human health care 
research conducted in space 
and signals the beginning of a 
new era of discovery,” he not -
ed. “UC San Diego will now 
have a place to grow and ex -
pand its vital research in bio -
tech and biopharma with full, 
on-orbit biomanufacturing 
and biofabrication centers to 
foster breakthrough advance -
ments and products in medical 
science that will benefit all life 
on Earth.”
In addition to cutting-edge 
research, Orbital Reef will also 
serve as a platform for com -
merce and tourism oppor -
tunities. Sierra Space brief ly 
described plans to equip it 
with the company’s Large In -
tegrated Flexible Environment 
(LIFE™) modules. These habi -
tats, designed to support 4-12 
individuals, are 3 stories tall, 
and 27 feet in diameter. They 
come equipped with a health 
monitoring system, air circu -lation, environmental moni -
toring, as well as an Astro Gar -
den to sustain longer missions. 
Transport to Orbital Reef will 
be facilitated by the compa -
ny’s Dream Chaser spacecraft, 
which was previously contract -
ed by NASA to provide cargo 
delivery to the ISS.
Sierra Space Corporation 
was founded in 2021 by Sierra 
Nevada Corporation (SNC), a 
private company that special -
izes in space systems and na -
tional security and defense. 
As of July 2020, SNC has been 
involved in 14 NASA Mars 
Missions, and has participated 
in more than 450 successful 
space missions. Previous proj -
ects SNC has been involved in 
include the design and devel -
opment of the MC-145B Coy -

radio-controlled improvised 
explosive devices and the STP -
Sat-5 satellite. More informa -

/uni25B6 FINANCIAL AID , from page 1
Subsidized and Unsubsidized 
Loans, and PLUS loans. Certify -
ing students’ academic activity 
would grant the campus an esti -
mated $370 million in /f_inancial 
federal aid for students, accord -
ing to University Communica -
tions Assistant Director Erika 
Johnson, in an email sent to /T_he 
UCSD Guardian.
In the email, Johnson further 
elaborated on why the ED was 
now enforcing this regulation. 
“Scrutiny of colleges and uni -
versities documenting the com -
mencement of academic activity 
is not new, and it has recently 
been a focus in U.S. Department 
of Education (ED) program re -
views,” Johnson said. “/T_he regu -
lation was sent to all University 
of California campuses and is 
included in the Code of Federal 
Regulations, which outlines how 
campuses must treat Title IV 
grant and loan funds if students 
do not begin attendance at our 
campus.” 
Johnson also noted that if 
UCSD fails to verify attendance, 
it poses a risk to the institution 
and the school’s ability to obtain 
and administer federal funds. 
According to an email from 
the Oﬃce of the Executive Vice 
Chancellor, UCSD’s adminis -
tration, Senate, and faculty to -
gether constructed the system. 
Because UCSD doesn’t require 
attendance to be taken, an al -
ternative process will be used to 
document commencement with 
the goal to be easy and as non-
intrusive as possible. 
Academic activity means at -
tending class, submitting an as -signment, taking a quiz or exam, 
writing on a discussion board, 
or talking with the professor 
about the subject material in the 
class. Each quarter, in order to 
have proof of engagement sub -
mitted, students must do one of 
the above activities by the end of 
Week 2. If students are added oﬀ 
of the waitlist late, a/f_ter Week 2, 
they must immediately contact 
the professor. 
Professors are able to track 
academic activity either manu -
ally or through #FinAid Can -
vas assignments. Additionally, 
professors can use an electronic 
form for the new Academic Ac -
tivity Tracking System. Accord -
ing to a notice from the Oﬃce of 
the Executive Vice Chancellor 
released on June 6, the Teach -
ing + Learning Commons and 
IT Services worked together to 
develop Canvas activities that 
can satisfy the criteria for com -
mencement of academic activity. 
Professors can add these activi -
ties to their Canvas page to track 
academic activity. Importantly, 
student records will be at the de -
fault “Yes,” and professors will 
change records to “No” when 
needed. According to the Q&A 
for instructors, this process 
should take /f_ive to ten minutes 
per quarter, but UCSD antici -
pates that for larger classes the 
process could be slower. 
If a student fails to com -
mence academic activity in 
enough units to satisfy the re -
quirements of their aid packag -
es, the Financial Aid and Schol -
arships Oﬃce will contact them 
via their school email. However, if a student believes that they did 
commence academic activity in 
a class that they were told they 
did not, they should contact the 
instructor of that class. 
In response to the new policy, 
Dr. Will Styler of the linguistics 
department explained that the 
greatest issue with the new pol -
icy is its inconvenience. 
“It’s not like we have a choice, 
but it is extra work that the in -
structors need to put in for the 
class they teach, and, in many 
ways, it’s extra work for students 
too, because many teachers are 
either using Canvas assignments 
to do this or creating an addi -
tional early homework,” Styler 
explained. 
Dr. Jeﬀ Tirsh/f_ield of the so -
ciology department noted his 
frustration with the monitoring 
system, saying it’s an unneces -
sary shi/f_t of responsibility onto 
instructors when tracking aca -
demic attendance should be for 
the university. 
“It’s merely a means of shi/f_t -
ing, what I perceive as an ad -
ministrative responsibility, to 
educators,” Tirsh/f_ield explained. 
Tirsh/f_ield further noted that 
the policy itself fails to follow 
what it claims to do fully. 
“If you think about the point 
of tracking, if it is merely to fol -
low, it really fails because it’s 
only a snapshot of a particular 
point in time. If it’s really not 
about tracking and it’s only a 
snapshot, what’s the purpose in 
terms of academic activity? It re -
ally does nothing to prove that 
there’s academic activity going 
on,” Tirsh/f_ield said. However, both Styler and 
Tirsh/f_ield noted that the moni -
toring system oﬀered opportu -
nities to help their students in 
the beginning of the new school 
year. Tirsh/f_ield appreciated that 
the #FinAid Canvas assignment 
had two questions concerning 
expectations and limitations 
which could be useful as a “ped -
agogic tool,” as Tirsh/f_ield noted. 
Styler used a discussion board 
where students introduced 
themselves to track the com -
mencement of academic activity, 
which proved to be helpful for 
students to introduce themselves 
to each other.
Tirsh/f_ield expressed some 
hesitancy with the monitoring 
of activity being linked with stu -
dents’ /f_inancial aid. 
“It doesn’t have to be un -
der the guise of /f_inancial aid,” 
Tirsh/f_ield said. “If, in fact, the 
Department of Education and 
the university need to get in -
formation on whether students 
are attending class so they lend 
them money, I understand that 
because there has to be some ac -
countability. But it should not be 
a separation of individuals who 
require money and those who 
don’t require money.”
In terms of improvements, 
Tirsh/f_ield hopes that the system 
will change to better promote 
the learning of students for in-
person settings by putting a 
greater pressure on student at -
tendance.
“If the USDE and the Univer -
sity want to increase learning, to 
increase knowledge, build bridg -
es, and spark engagement, true engagement between educators 
and students, and students and 
students, and make sure that 
/f_inancial aid dollars are ben -
e/f_iting those engaged in the uni -
versity experience,” Tirsh/f_ield 
explained in a follow-up email 
to /T_he Guardian, “they should 
mandate and track attendance 
and participation — each class, 
each student.”
Styler expressed hope, noting 
that this process is still new and 
improvements are still to come.
“We’ve been preparing for 
this for a relatively small num -
ber of months. So as a result, all 
of the systems are brand new for 
taking care of this,” he said. “I 
hope there will be other things 
that make it a little easier, you 
know — like any Canvas assign -
ment gets a grade, that person 
has commenced.”
Styler also added that this 
system will be another element 
of UCSD for years to come, as 
long as the policy and system re -
main, and professors will adjust 
accordingly. 
“Teachers will just adapt to 
it,” he said. “/T_hey’ll start add -
ing an assignment early on that 
is designed to be in accord with 
this, and hopefully build it more 
into the curriculum.”

The Supreme Court is Leaving the Voting 
Right Act in Tact (For Now)
A few days ago, I saw an ar -
ticle in the New York Times that 
was titled something along the 
lines of “Supreme Court is lean -
ing towards striking down the 
Voting Rights Act, ” to paraphrase 
heavily. I had already looked into 
the case being heard this term 
around the time of Roe v. Wade’s 
overturning, but this framing 
bothered me to the point where 
I decided to dive deeper into 
this term’s redistricting case. I 
am here to answer a few ques -
tions. /T_he /f_irst is to clear up the 
case being presented. From there 
I will argue that the facts of the 
story lead to the conclusion that 
the most likely outcome is the 
same outcome that was decided 
by the conservative lower court. 
However, in the post-Roe era 
court, nothing is promised, so I 
will cover the worst case scenario 
of what will happen and what we 
should do. 
First let us talk about the 
case being presented. /T_he case 
is Merrill vs. Milligan or Mer -
ril v. Caster. /T_he case is based 
on the Alabama congressional 
map drawn a/f_ter the 2020 census 
which massively underrepresent -
ed Black voters. Alabama is 25% 
black, but only 1 in 7 districts 
represented Black voters. /T_his is 
a violation of the Voting Rights 
Act (VRA). In the law, racial ger -
rymandering has a considerable 
amount of precedent. /T_hornburg 
v. Gingles (1986) established that 
minority voters get proper repre -
sentation under Section 2 of the 
Voting Rights Act. Shaw v. Reno 
(1993) demonstrated that courts 
can strike down racist districts. 
Bush v. Vera (1996) demonstrat -
ed that race cannot be used as 
a proxy for political aﬃliation. 
Cooper v. Harris (2017) demon -
strated that partisanship cannot 
be used for racial gerrymander -
ing. Most judges would see this 
Alabama case fairly open-and-
shut considering the precedent. Unlike partisan gerrymandering, 
the court does interfere in racial 
gerrymandering cases in favor 
of no discrimination. /T_he lower 
court judges did /f_ind the case 
fairly open-and-shut and ruled 
in favor of the voting activist in 
the case. /T_his was fairly signi/f_i -
cant as a barometer of things to 
come, considering that two of the 
three judges were Trump appoin -
tees, and our Supreme Court has 
three Trump appointees, who are 
all most likely to be pro-Alabama 
in this case. 
/T_he evidence might seem to 
point in favor of a pro-Voting 
Rights Act ruling, but the ac -
tions of the conservative mem -
bers on the Supreme Court in the 
past still need to be considered, 
along with how “liberally” they 
have been playing with precedent 
since Justice Amy Coney Barret 
took her seat. For example, in 
Shelby County v. Holder (2013), 
the Supreme Court gutted Sec -
tion 5 of the VRA, which was 
central to protecting underrep -
resented minorities from racial 
gerrymandering. /T_his was done 
by Chief Justice John Roberts, 
who is now considered to be 
one of the Court’s more moder -
ate conservatives. /T_his case is a 
bad sign for those who favor the 
VRA. Additionally, in Brnovich 
vs. Democratic National Com -
mittee (DNC) (2021) the court 
ruled against a case which was 
in favor of the VRA Section 2, 
which is notably of concern in the 
upcoming case, another bad sign. 
However, for those in favor of 
the Voting Rights Act, the DNC 
in this case was arguably stretch -
ing the bounds of Section 2 into 
partisanship and out of race, fur -
ther than the Alabama case being 
heard now. Finally, of concern, is 
the liberal disregard for precedent 
by the current Supreme Court. 
Roe v. Wade demonstrated that 
the conditions to disregard prec -
edent are a lot more /f_lexible than 
previously established. /T_herefore, 
even though this case has strong 
precedent, it is hard to decide if 
the case is open-and-shut like it was in the lower courts.
Regardless, this case will be 
decided along the same lines of 
precedent cases. /T_he transcrip -
tions of the recordings and the 
line of questioning by Roberts 
make it appear as though the 
conservatives are not fully with 
Alabama in this case. Notably, 
Roberts, who appears to have a 
vendetta against the VRA, has 
been very critical of the Alabama 
lawyers in their case hearing 
on the 4th of this month. /T_hese 
comments are due to the strong 
precedent, but also due to the fact 
that it appears that Alabama has a 
messy case that seems to be large -
ly built on absurd race arguments 
that run counter to the common 
understanding of the law. Ala -
bama’s strongest argument is a 
more narrow interpretation of 
the VRA ’s second section. How -
ever, the arguments supporting 
the case are absurd. A section of 
Alabama’s argument argues that 
the historical application of the 
VRA is unconstitutional because 
it is racist, and it is racist because 
it is simply about race. It is evi -
dent the judges found this argu -
ment to be absurd. Alito called 
it ‘far-reaching’ and even Barrett 
made comments about intent in 
discrimination being irrelevant. Justice Clarence /T_homas did not 
say anything, but he is the most 
silent judge on the court, so this 
isn’t indicative of any signi/f_icant 
opinions. However, these com -
ments made by the conservative 
judges are indicative of consen -
sus with the lower court judges, 
in the best case, or a narrowing of 
Section 2 in the worst case. /T_he 
chances of complete abolition or 
dramatic change is slim based on 
the shaky argument from Ala -
bama and the far-reaching and 
mostly uncontroversial precedent 
regarding the VRA protections.
What does it mean if the worst 
case scenario happens, and if it 
does, what is supposed to be done 
to /f_ix it? Even if the court sides 
entirely with Alabama in this 
case, such a scenario would not 
destroy the VRA, but narrow the 
application of Section 2. /T_hough 
not ideal, the VRA would still be 
in place, providing some protec -
tions. /T_hat is, unless the Supreme 
Court declares the VRA to be 
unconstitutional. In this very 
unlikely scenario, the only path 
is passing a bill through Con -
gress. In 1980, Congress amend -
ed the VRA to show that intent 
of discrimination is irrelevant, 
a change which is evidently still 
held by the courts today. If the BY SEAMUS MCNULTY

VRA is gutted further, Congress 
can pass an amendment similar 
to the one in 1980 to further ex -
pand the application of Section 2 
to the point where the court can 
no longer /f_ind issue with Section 
2, as they do now. 
/T_he most ideal action in the 
worst case scenario is an amend -
ment to the Constitution which 
solidi/f_ies fairness in redistricting. 
/T_his could also include protec -
tions for class and party, along 
with race. /T_his could help tackle 
the rampant misrepresentation 
problem in this country along 
a variety of bases. Without con -
gressional action on this issue, 
we are rolling the dice every year 
and hoping that important voting 
protections stay in place. Con -
sidering the conservative nature 
of our Supreme Court, the luck 
of those in favor of more protec -
tions on voting will not last long. 
It is the job of the legislature to 
legislate and the court to rule on 
legislation not make it. Further 
inaction of Congress on this is -
sue will lead to a future where 
the legislation is more and more 
done by the Supreme Court./gid00042/gid00076/gid00064/gid00070/gid00068/gid00001/gid00066/gid00078/gid00084/gid00081/gid00083/gid00068/gid00082/gid00088/gid00001/gid00078/gid00069/gid00001/gid00054/gid00077/gid00082/gid00079/gid00075/gid00064/gid00082/gid00071/gid00015
As the quarter progresses, and 
as we tenuously type /f_irst words on 
blank pages, let’s remember their 
magic. I write that as a reminder 
to myself as much as you. 
I forget the magic of words. I 
forget the spells cast from sounds 
formed into shapes that, when 
combined carefully, reveal some -
thing of the world and can change 
it in the process.
I forget when I read. Whether 
it’s /T_homas Mann’s “/T_he Magic 
Mountain” or a student essay, I 
read as I eat most meals. I con -
sume the words while doing other 
things: answering my daughter’s 
cry, receiving a friend’s text and 
ignoring political spam, swiping 
to a screen that reveals a thing that 
needs to be bought or an email in 
need of response. So, when I read, I scan. I skip words. I get the gist so 
I can move to other tasks. In doing 
so, whatever magic was there, in 
the writing, is lost. Any potential 
spell cast by the writer doesn’t take 
eﬀect on me, a reader who no lon -
ger has conditions to read.
/T_he same can be said of my 
writing. When it comes to text 
messages and emails, I /f_ind my -
self relying on memes, emojis, and 
at most a hastily thumbed reply. 
My word volume, even to close 
friends, has shrunk year by year. 
As has the length of their replies. 
More importantly the substance 
seems missing. Gone are the sto -
ries we used to share. Gone are 
the word games we used to play. 
I haven’t yet reached the point 
where I let Google’s algorithm re -
ply for me, but I do feel something 
of that algorithm — its eﬃcient 
cold logic — has been internalized 
by me and my closest readers.
Don’t worry. /T_his isn’t anoth -er essay bemoaning technology. 
What I really want to write about 
is magic. So let me return to that.
Y es, I forgot the magic of 
words. But forgetting is a neces -
sary condition for remembering. 
And the other day, I remembered.
It took a prompt from the di -
rectors of my writing program to 
remind me of that magic. At our 
orientation, they gave me and my 
colleagues a worksheet with these 
directions: “Identify signi/f_icant 
moments in your writing/literacy/
illiteracy development that have 
shaped your sense of your writerly 
identity. /T_hey may be positive, 
negative, or neutral events. Place 
them along a rough timeline. ”
As someone who has a terrible 
sense of linear time, I envisioned 
a constellation of bubbles rather 
than a straight line. /T_he /f_irst bub -
ble that rose to the surface read:
Da helping me to spell./T_hose /f_ive words had a power 
on me in orientation, just as they 
do now. /T_hey pull me down the

and space, and suddenly I am a 
boy of seven.
  We had immigrated two 
years before, Ma coming ahead 
of us from Ireland. She worked a 
hard, lonely year as a nurse to set 
up a home for the family: my Da, 
my brother, my sister, and me. 
/T_hese were lean times, Da out of

I’ve been tasked with a report

thing outside of me that held me 
up, something about our situation 
I don’t yet understand. But it’s also 
something inside: I like looking at 
clouds pass by the window rather 
than what teacher writes on the 
board. I prefer the worlds in my 
mind rather than the classroom. 
And, anyway, when it comes to 
tests, I just copy the squiggles 
from the other student’s exams.

But they’ve caught on, haven’t 
they? /T_hey’ve put me in a remedial 
class with the other problem chil -
dren. I saw the “normal” kids look 
at us with smirks as we were called 
into Sister Germana’s classroom. 
She and that room have a repu -
tation. /T_hat reputation has now 
marked us.
/T_he teachers spoke to Ma and 
Da too. /T_hey ordered them to put 
in extra work. But they’re always 
so tired, Ma from her nursing and 
Da, either from counseling ad -
dicts coming oﬀ the drugs or from 
the three beers he guzzled before 
retreating to his room.
He’s tired now, but he’s trying 
his best to help me while Ma is at 
work. I’ve told him that I have to 
write a report on the life of a Saint. 
We settle on Da’s namesake, Saint 
Patrick.
Da begins his story, the words 
/f_loat across the room from his 
mouth to my ear to my hand.
“Patrick was a slave, ” he says. 
He backtracks to the /f_irst word. 
/T_he letters begin their journey 
now. Letter by letter, he spells his 
name. /T_hen come the next two 
simple words. To make sure I’m 
following, he repeats: “Patrick … 
was … a … slave . Slave … ”
“S”
“L ”
“A”
“V”
“E”
“Period. Full Stop. ”
My hand moves to catch these 
letters, arranged in an order that’s 
new to me.
“Do you know what a slave is, 
Niall?” /T_hese words are spoken 
in a diﬀerent tone, more life to 
them. We pause our work. I shake 
my head no. Da doesn’t give me a 
Webster’s de/f_inition of the word 
slave. He paints the picture of a 
fellow sitting happily in a green 
/f_ield. Suddenly pirates appear, 
tackle him, drag him aboard their 
ship. I see Patrick being put in 
chains. I see him rowing, painfully 
painfully, with other men across 
choppy seas. ”
I know the word now. I’ll for -
ever know it.
I’ve learned to spell.
We continue. Letter by letter, 
sentence by sentence, we build 
my /f_irst paragraph. It’s not an of -
/f_icial biography. It’s fantastic. Our 
last line reads, “Patrick drove the 
snakes from Ireland. ”
Da pauses, “But ya know, Niall, 
I think he forgot to drive out the 
two-legged snakes!” He chuckles. 
I ask him if I should include that 
line in the report and he says, “ Ah, 
God no!”
  -
Da’s spell worked. Once I saw 
that the particular arrangement 
of those squiggles could unlock a 
whole world, a world where peo -
ple were chained and where chains 
were broken, I felt a subtle click. 
Sound connected with shape and 
the word was born in my mind.
I began to read those words. 
When I didn’t know what they 
meant, I could look up their story 
in our dictionary. I even began to 
arrange letters, without Da’s guid -
ance, into words, sentences, para -
graphs.I read voraciously. I looked 
for more adventures in the lives 
of Saints but never found stories 
as exciting as Da’s Saint Patrick. 
So I moved to adventure stories 
that stranded me on an island 
circled by a blood-thirsty shark, 
that pulled me to the center of the 
earth, that launched me to space. 
I devoured them. My teachers 
told Ma and Da that I was read -
ing above my level. I had outpaced 
the peers who smirked at me, but 
I didn’t have time to gloat. I was 
busy looking for books.
/T_hen, the day when a classmate 
gave me his copy of “/T_he Hobbit. ” 
He’ d burned through it, and I soon 
saw why. Tolkien’s words enchant -
ed me like no others since Da’s. 
I didn’t just read that book. I in -
habited it. I escaped to cozy nooks 
in Bilbo’s hobbit hole. I struggled 
through the tangled trees of Mirk -
wood. I saw the Lonely Mountain 
on the horizon. I felt Smaug’s hot 
breath breathing down the pas -
sageway. All of this was brought to 
life in my mind long before mov -
ies and streaming services. All 
through words!
By high school, my reading 
taste had shi/f_ted to /f_irst person 
stories. /T_hey seem like old friends 
now: the protagonist of Joyce’s 
“ Araby” who in an instant is 
struck by life’s vanity, Alex from “ A 
Clockwork Orange” who revealed 
what horrible “cures” modern so -
cieties produce, Frank McCourt 
who used present tense to relive 
his youth, Maxine Hong Kinston 
who inhabited myth to reclaim 
what history erased. /T_he word, 
I discovered, could reveal the 
worlds behind one’s eyes. It could 
bring me into another’s skin, even 
someone I detested like Nabokov’s 
Humbert Humbert who lied so 
beautifully.
- 
Along the way, the spell was 
broken. Words lost their magic. It 
began when I had to write about 
those beloved books for graded 
papers and standardized tests. To 
succeed in those arenas, I had to 
follow certain rules: Get rid of the 
I. Write objectively. Cite evidence 
from experts. Follow this formula 
to write a good essay, this formula 
to write a good paragraph, this 
formula to write a good sentence. 
All of this molded my words to 
that uncomfortable shape called 
“academic writing. ”
Writing was no longer a con -
tainer of life;, words no longer cast 
a spell. /T_he text, as I soon learned 
to call it, was now an object to pil -
lage for data. Writing about texts 
became a mechanical process of 
extracting, plugging in, churn -
ing out data. What I produced 
— the academic essay — served 
as a measurement of my ability, 
its words a marker of my worth 
or worthlessness. /T_his approach 
to writing was best summed up 
to me by a composition profes -
sor who once took on extra work 
grading SAT essays.  At the grad -
ing center, he encountered a vet -
eran grader who claimed he could 
pin several essays on the wall, ten 
feet away from where they stood, 
and determine their score just 
from their shape on the page. His eyes had become so attuned to the 
standardized mold that he no lon -
ger needed to see the particular 
words.  
I stuck to academic writing as 
one might stick to a comatose lov -
er. My commitment brought me 
to a doctoral program in literature 
at this university. In my studies, 
I read texts about that word Da 
had helped me spell. /T_here was an 
impenetrability to academic writ -
ing on slavery, jargon that would 
stump folks like Ma and Da, sen -
tence structures that would leave 
them puzzled. I felt lost myself, as 
if I was listening to people speak in 
a club where I didn’t belong. It was 
diﬀerent when I read Sojourner 
Truth and Frederick Douglass. 
/T_he magic was there. But even 
when I read their words, I didn’t 
have time to sit with them. I didn’t 
have time to let their spell take ef -
fect. I only had time to force their 
words into my essays, to contain 
them in abstract theories, to seal 
their magic behind jargon that 
was legible to institutions never 
built for such magicians.
I still found glimpses of magic 
when I crossed paths with pro -
fessors who cast spells with their 
words. I think of Page DuBois 
whose book on slavery showed me 
that academic writing didn’t have 
to be impenetrable, that illuminat -
ing research questions come from 
childhood curiosities, that words 
can honor the lives of subjects his -
torically constructed as objects. 
Mostly, Page showed me that writ -
ing can still be pleasurable in in -
hospitable contexts. 
And with pleasure comes pow -
er.
-
I could have been born into 
a diﬀerent life. I could have been 
born into a lavish home rather 
than immigrating to a roach-in -
fested apartment. I could have had 
parents who valued things over 
care. I could have always been 
ahead of the curve. Perhaps then, 
this essay would have been about 
learning to spell Master rather 
than Slave. It would have been 
about /f_inding a room of my own 
where I mastered language, a cor -
poration where I mastered nature, 
a start-up where I mastered some 
uncommodi/f_ied realm of life. We 
are surrounded by such stories. 
/T_heir magic is strong, their spell 
deadly.
But I was born to my Ma and 
Da, a nurse born in a Philippines 
barrio and an Irish priest who 
cared for addicts.  I am shaped 
by them and their values, by their 
family histories, by the histories 
of their lands. And I’m happy 
for that. It has given me baggage, 
certainly. But it has also given me 
good magic.
Now, as a teacher of “academ -
ic” writing, I share that magic with 
students. I show them they can 
still work good spells with their 
words, even in a context where 
dark magic rules, even in condi -
tions where most readers do not 
have time to let the spell do its 
work.  
I do it in the way Da taught 
me in his room decades ago. On 
the /f_irst day of class, I point to the object my students are sitting in. I 
spell the word:
“D”
“E”
“S”
“K”
/T_hat word doesn’t reveal 
much, I tell students. But a magic 
combination of words can reveal 
its deeper story. We could tell 
a story of the desk’s parts, of the 
workers who assembled the parts, 
of the raw materials in the parts, 
of the workers who mined those 
materials, of the care-workers be -
hind those who worked parts and 
materials, of the damaged Earth 
from which all of this was drawn. 
Or, our words might speak of two 
within that chain who stole time 
to gaze upon the stars or who, de -
spite all that was stacked against 
them, managed to get their kid to 
a top-ranked college.
We can use our words to bring 
back such stories, I tell students. 
We can share these stories with 
those willing to sit for a moment 
and listen.  When we do, our read -
ers don’t sit in the same desk. Sud -
denly, it is imbued with the magic 
of life. We’ve worked our spell. 
And when our readers get up 
from their desks, they’re no longer 
the same person. /T_hey are in-the-
world diﬀerently. 
Y our words can do that, I re -
mind students.
My students sit and listen. 
/T_hey then work magic in their 
writing. 
Writing can reveal magical 
patterns that are hidden in plain 
sight. Writing this essay, for ex -
ample, has helped me see a circle. 
To show it, I return to the timeline 
I put together when prompted by 
my writing directors. /T_he last bub -
ble in my constellation reads:
 
Teaching Aislynn how to spell.
 
Aislynn is my three-and-a-
half-year-old daughter. I see my 
parents in her, my Da’s rascally na -ture and Ma’s /f_ierce will. I see my 
wife’s mom who passed away from 
cancer before we met. She’s in that 
glimmer of light that I’ve seen in 
old photographs, in my wife’s eye, 
and now in our child’s. We meet 
our ancestors in her too. My wife 
has seen her maternal grandmoth -
er, who she never met, who once 
stood with the same posture that 
she and my daughter now /f_ind 
themselves standing in.
And, of course, my wife and I 
are in her too. For one thing, she 
loves stories.
So, the other night, her usual 
bedtime request came: “Tell me a 
story, Daddy!” (It’s an imperative 
now, but we’ll work on that.)
Since it’s fresh in my mind, I 
begin Da’s story of Saint Patrick. 
I pause on the word Da paused 
on. “Do you know what that word 
means, Aislynn?”
“What is it, ” she asks in her 
sing-song voice.
I tell her the story Da told me. 
I feel the roots of our homeland 
woven into each syllable. I feel 
the letters knotting themselves to -
gether into words. /T_hough he died 
three years ago, I feel Da too, wo -
ven into these sounds that become 
words that become stories. It is his 
story, a/f_ter all. He wasn’t a slave. 
But he was compelled from his 
homeland by a type of economic 
piracy. He found a way to preach 
in this land of his captivity. I’ d say

/T_he woefully inaccurate but stunningly beautiful “Blonde” (2022) managed to spark contro -
versy for its discourse; however, a good portion of the criticism seems to be much ado about 
nothing. /T_hus, with a /f_ine-toothed comb and a magnifying glass, senior writer Fabian Garcia 
breaks down what “Blonde” is really trying to say, with maybe a few bumps along the way.
/T_he second attempt at adapting Joyce Carole Oates's 2000 novel “Blonde” comes in the 
form of Net/f_lix’s newest original movie of the same name. Already making headlines for 
its rare NC-17 rating, the high-pro/f_ile release was further underscored by public response 
toward the subject matter of the /f_ilm and the nature of the main subject’s adaptation on 
screen. Despite this, those involved with the /f_ilm maintain that their portrayal of Marilyn 
Monroe (played by Ana De Armas) is a work of /f_iction, nothing more. Is it possible that the 
borrowed name from the hallmark /f_ilm actress is really meant to act as a vessel for what 
is potentially a deeper narrative about Hollywood and the concept of the actor itself? Is it 
equally possible that the long journey to get to those arguments is riddled with blunders 
more common than one would prefer? Yes, all of the above. 
“Blonde” has nothing to hide. It always reveals its hand right before it begins to play, in -
sistent on telegraphing exactly what the character onscreen is feeling whether it's through 
unfathomable camera tricks or not-so-subtle visual metaphors. Aspect ratios bend and 
/f_lex liberally and palettes switch from technicolor to monochrome at the drop of a hat. 
As Monroe feels trapped in her spiral of vitriol and exploitation, suddenly the frame 
tightens around her face, and the aspect ratio boxes itself in, the greyscale photography 
emphasizing the poignant shadows cast across her face. A long shot presents a ravenous 
theater applauding the screen before them, Monroe center stage, the frame outstretched 
as wide as possible in full and glorious color. While these are basic conventions and used 
accordingly, they’re o/f_ten broad strokes when compared to the minutiae of what's really 
happening. 
/T_he most prominent dilemma that “Blonde” faces is the sheer fact that there are only 
so many ways to communicate the same feeling, the same emotion, without teetering into 
territory that feels gratuitous and grotesque. Writer and director Andrew Dominik’s rem -
edy for this issue is bloating the /f_ilm full of pretty images and cutting-edge cinematogra -
phy in order to maintain a consistent aesthetic language — an antibiotic to a contagious 
superbug. Against all odds, “Blonde” makes it possible to prove a point a little too well. A 
rather moot point at that. 
Cinematographer Chayse Irvin has worked on many music videos and music /f_ilms in 
the past, including Beyonce’s “Lemonade” /f_ilm and Sampha’s “Process'' short, and it would 
appear he’s taken a lot of those sensibilities and applied them to “Blonde” in an overt fash -
ion./T_here’s a noticeable amount of care put into cra/f_ting the world of “Blonde,” with each 
scene de/f_tly created to look as gorgeous as humanly possible. A new gimmick is constantly 
being applied in order to communicate some underlying mood, much like you would see 
in a high-budget music video. 
A SnorriCam rig is used to communicate emotional distress in two diﬀerent scenes. A 
well-positioned mirror shot features Norma Jeane begging Monroe to “come back” right 
before a dramatic shi/f_t occurs between the sobbing face of Norma Jeane and sunny dispo -
sition of Monroe. A hazy /f_ilter and shallow lens is applied to Monroe right before her abor -
tion to visually express her absentia. /T_he obvious nods to the ever-surrealist tendencies of 
David Lynch are a clever homage but an equally pale imitation. /T_he /f_ilm relies so heavily 
on visuals alone to convey what are, in all honesty, very straightforward sentiments. It’s 
not an inherently obnoxious thing, but rather a moment that is never properly seized. To 
reiterate, if graded on looks alone, “Blonde” would stand in a league of its own, but unfor -
tunately, that isn't the case here. 
/T_here are serious rami/f_ications for leaving the more profound concepts to be spoon-fed 
to the audience in ham-/f_isted ways. /T_he writing too o/f_ten suﬀers from appearing properly 
disingenuous. Monroe whispers to her aborted fetus about her lapsed pregnancy in a scene 
that feels uncharacteristically supernatural. She habitually struggles to meet the demands 
of men she seeks validation from due to an absent father /f_igure. She feels the need to prove 
her worth either sexually or intellectually to her face-warped fans. /T_here’s a evident lack of 
subtlety and nuance in articulating these notions, which in some cases comes across as if 
Dominik thinks the audience is too stupid to understand what’s really going on. In addition, not much is done to /f_lesh out the abuse through line the /f_ilm capitalizes on. 
/T_here is no catharsis to this apparent idée /f_ixe “Blonde” has with mistreatment. We watch 
her become victimized, we can see things aren't right, and we can empathize with what’s 
happening to her, but nothing more is being said or mediated. In its near three-hour run -
time, the message it carries can be diminished to a few sentences, let alone the thousand 
words a picture deserves. 
With all that said, is it fair to say these /f_laws come across as disrespectful? Well, the 
answer isn't all that simple. Marilyn Monroe is treated as a character, and Norma Jeane 
properly follows suit. Yet, the majority has found that this route has somehow bastardized 
the person it's based on, even though it's ironically not any diﬀerent from what the public 
has already done to Norma Jeane Baker as a person. Above all else, the /f_ilm contends the 
fact that a narrative has already attached itself to Norma Jeane whether we like it or not. 
What the /f_ilm seeks to do is blur that line further. Dominik alleges we will never truly 
know who Marilyn Monroe is, or was, nor do we really deserve to. 
In contrast to the various themes of the /f_ilm, nothing substantial about Monroe's ac -
tual life or career is explicitly revealed to the viewer. “Blonde” assumes you already know 
everything about her, but in reality, we’re only getting snapshots of the famous star, recog -
nizable pieces everyone is bound to associate and identify with. It opts to recontextualize 
those moments in a new light, unlike a real biopic which would present them as a de/f_initive 
fact. Watching “Blonde” play out is like looking at those photos you’d see of Marilyn Mon -
roe on mood boards or 50s-themed diners and creating the story around them, tracing 
the line that eventually fell to the hands of fate. In this case, the /f_ilm excels at using these 
references, however much like its other subtleties, or lack thereof, they don't always land 
quite how they’re intended to. It’s not easy to identify with someone based on iconography 
alone. Although, to Armas’s credit, she does sell the look and feel of Marilyn Monroe to 
an uncanny degree, . Eenough to where those moments of weakness could continue to 
suspend your disbelief. 
For what it’s worth, “Blonde” doesn't seem concerned with being an ultra-realistic, 
true-to-form biopic about the convoluted life of Marilyn Monroe. It also doesn't seem in -
terested in being a neo-feminist condemnation of Hollywood and the abuse actresses suf -
fered during this period, nor does it really need to be. Instead, we have a hyper-stylized 
portrait of psychosis, the drama of a Hollywood Star misunderstood, misappropriated, 
and minimized. It’s far more content with being a metaphor of itself. Monroe laments that 
all movies do is “cut, cut, cut,” and in practice that does typically seem to be the case for 
“Blonde.”
In most circumstances, Monroe’s pain feels like a spectacle, which does make it easy 
to interpret the /f_ilm as exploitative and borderline disrespectful. However, that narrative 
can't help but feel a little cut- and- dry beside the unmistakable polish applied to so much 
of the /f_ilm.
Much like David Fincher in his 2020 feature “Mank,” Andrew Dominik had the im -
possible task of recreating 1950’s Hollywood in the modern day. It’s a feat easier said than 
done and was achieved almost /f_lawlessly. It’s hard to deny Armas' compelling ability to 
channel Marilyn Monroe. She isn't a carbon copy, but is, instead, capturesing the essence 
of a timeless movie star, and you can’t help but feel like you’re watching her grace the silver 
screen once again. /T_he plethora of breathtaking shots throughout the /f_ilm looks almost 
one- of- a- kind, if not a bit intoxicating. Distilling the work to a meek sexploitation /f_ilm 
is grossly dismissive. 
“Blonde” goes way above the call of duty but manages to miss a few of its marks, each 
of which varies in signi/f_icance. Did the world of cinema really need this depiction of Mari -
lyn Monroe as a helpless victim? Are we really just adding to the noise? Not necessarily. 
Not unlike how Norma Jeane is trapped in “Blonde,” the real-life Norma Jeane is for -
ever con/f_ined to the collective memory of society: the pinnacle sex symbol of Hollywood’s 
golden age, known for playing a “dumb blonde,” despite never actually being either of 
those things. In an all too cruel and common twist, the fact of the matter is, even real life 
can be inaccurate.

EUNICE KIM AND OISHEE MISRA  
Marco Werman remembers 
a time when he had to cut reels 
worth of tape with a razor blade in 
order to edit audio. With over 20 
years of journalism experience un -
der his belt, he has had to adapt to 
emerging technology and bounce 
between storytelling platforms, a 
skill that he deems crucial for any 
aspiring journalist. 
“Are you kind of wedded to 
any particular platform or are you 
more interested in telling stories?” 
Werman said. “I think that’s really 
important to kind of diﬀerenti -
ate between those two, I think it’s 
about what are the stories you’re 
interested in…”
Werman has spent almost ev -
ery weekday for the past nine years 
hosting public radio’s global news 
show “/T_he World,” which covers 
everything from breaking news 
to unique features. /T_he seasoned 
journalist  joined the UC San Di -
ego department of communication 
over the summer as the university’s 
very /f_irst journalist-in-residence.   
Having lived on the east coast 
since the mid-90s, Werman and 
his wife decided that they wanted 
to live somewhere warmer. A/f_ter 
weighing their options, and con -
sidering locations such as France 
and Costa Rica, the couple ulti -
mately settled on Southern Cali -
fornia. Werman started thinking 
of how to bring a more dynamic 
sense of collaboration to “/T_he 
World” in California. Having 
broadcasted the show alone from 
his home throughout the pandem -
ic, Werman was ready for some 
change. When he was connected 
to the Chair of the Communica -
tion department Brian Goldfarb, 
everything fell into place.   In addition to broadcasting 
“/T_he World” from campus daily, 
Werman plans to foster a col -
laborative environment between 
students, faculty, and his team 
during his time with the depart -
ment.  
“I really hope that it’s kind of 
like [a] two way street,” Werman 
said. “So as much as students 
might be able to learn from 
me… I’m also really hoping that 
I and the show can learn from 
students and from faculty. It’s 
about growing and kind of cri -
tiquing the show and making it 
better and stronger.” 
Werman plans to visit two 
communication classrooms this 
quarter, Professor Kidman’s 
COMM 134 class on media 
audiences to discuss audience 
metrics, and Professor Hallin’s 
COMM 109N class on Ameri -
can News Media to discuss what 
goes into producing an episode. 
Professor Hallin’s class will be 
listening to an episode of “/T_he 
World” and a few days later, 
Werman and his producer plan 
on visiting the class and explain -
ing the production process. 
“/T_here is a kind of sense with 
listeners that this is all happen -
ing live. People say ‘How many 
guests do you have in your stu -
dio in an hour?’ and it’s like, 
well, actually a lot of those in -
terviews are pre-produced and 
then I do the continuity mostly 
live but everything’s kind of 
edited very tightly. So we’ll be 
explaining that and answering 
questions.” Werman said.  
Werman’s passions lay with 
photography at the start of his 
career, and he initially wanted 
to become a photojournalist. 
While he ultimately ended up 
taking the broadcast journalism 
route, to this day Werman said that he enjoys bringing his cam -
era with him while on assignment 
for “/T_he World.” 
A journalist since he was 16, 
Werman understands the impor -
tance of versatility in the /f_ield; in 
fact, he thinks that journalists are 
a lot like “Jeopardy” pros. Just as a 
vast array of knowledge aids Jeop -
ardy players in covering every 
category, Werman believes that a 
similar sense of adaptability helps 
journalists in broadening their 
scope. 
He places emphasis on “the 
ability to pack in a lot of disparate 
information, and [being] ready to 
kind of [be] like ‘Alright, I can do 
a story on Zika in Brazil’ or ‘Sure, 
I can do a story on grunge rock in 
Ukraine during war time.’” Wer -
man said.
Over the course of his career, 
he has constantly had to adapt to 
new mediums and environments. 
Following three years in the Peace 
Corps in Togo, Werman worked 
as a freelancer for the Associated 
Press in West Africa for a while, 
struggling to make ends meet. 
When the opportunity arose for 
him to take over the Africa beat 
for the BBC World Service, he 
embraced it.
“I felt like radio was pretty 
easy for me to understand … my 
parents never had a TV so I lis -
tened to a lot of radio … I listened 
to a lot of spoken word records, 
and I had kind of already had a 
sense of how you kind of write for 
the ear,” Werman said. 
A/f_ter two years doing straight 
dispatches for the BBC from Oua -
gadougou, he took on a position 
at the BBC headquarters in Lon -
don, and spent a year producing 
a morning show about Africa. 
From there, he returned to the 
States to help start a brand new 
radio station in upstate New York. He spent years building the 
station from practically nothing, 
and became a new director that 
/f_illed two hours of radio /f_ive days 
a week. From news to interviews 
to music, Werman touched on a 
little bit of everything.
“I was just hooked; I just loved 
radio,” Werman said. “I loved 
what you were able to do, I loved 
that as a writer, it involved writ -
ing but it also involved kind of 
writing into the sound.” 
When he got a call from a for -
mer colleague at the BBC regard -
ing a new program called “/T_he 
World,” he was ecstatic. Werman 
has been with the show since it 
started in 1995, and has had the 
opportunity to travel around the 
world, from Brazil to Japan, over 
the years. Such experiences have 
shaped his approach to journal -
ism, causing him to better appre -
ciate his years in Ouagadougou  
and reject the concept of para -
chute journalism during which 
reporters will spend short periods 
of time in a place on assignment.   
“I really encourage younger 
journalists to kind of really get 
to know a place, spend some time 
living in a place, maybe writing 
about it, maybe doing journal -
ism, while you’re there,” Werman said. “I really think it’s so impor -
tant to spend time really immers -
ing yourself in a place and un -
derstanding the nuances of how 
people live there and once you get 
that, like if you live in a develop -
ing country for like two years, 
there’s a lot you can kind of apply 
to other developing countries.”
Breaking out of that America-
centric bubble that easily ensnares 
people is something that “/T_he 
World” tries to actively combat. 
Werman and his team aim to 
shed light on issues and triumphs 
around the globe that haven’t re -
ceived much, if any, global cover -
age. /T_hey try to strike the perfect 
balance between hard news, the 
top stories of the day, and more 
optimistic stories that leave lis -
teners feeling hopeful. 
“Remember that you’re kind 
of educators as well, and there's a 
huge responsibility on that,'' Wer -
man said. “But also that educa -
tion … remember that it can help 
change the world.”
Now that he plans on broad -
casting from campus daily, 
Werman is excited to continue 
sharing his expertise with the 
community, and hopefully foster 
a new wave of broadcast journal -
ism on campus.

I came face-to-face with death 
on September 13, 2022. But so did 
the Armenian people.
/T_his is our story. A story that 
began with the Armenian genocide 
led by the Ottoman Turks in1915, 
and continues with Azerbaijan’s 
continued eﬀorts to ethnically 
cleanse the Armenian people from 
the face of the Earth.
My family and I were in Jer -
muk, Armenia — a popular tour -
ist city — when we were awoken at 
12:05 a.m. by the sound of bombs 
exploding and the feeling of the 
building shaking. Azerbaijan was 
attacking Armenia. We quickly 
grabbed our phones and passports 
and ran toward the basement in 
order to seek safety. Waiting in the 
basement was torture — children 
crying, adultsrepeatedly scour -
ing the internet for any news or 
updates on the ongoing attacks, 
American tourists calling the 
United States Embassy located in 
the capital city of Yerevan, and me, 
helplessly accepting that I may no 
longer be on this Earth anymore.
And then, the news broke. Ar -
menian news outlets began report -

decided to /f_lee. /T_he mountains

land, homes, and bodies. Sol -
diers and civilian’s dead bodies. 
Dozens of military vehicles were 
driving up the mountain rush -

from this unprovoked attack. 
I was suddenly overcome with 
the feeling of guilt. Guilt for not 
being able to go help protect Ar -
menian men who are 18, 19, 20 
years old, having their lives cut 
short at the hands of violence 
and brutality by those who seek 
to erase the Armenian race.

out to pay for RIMAC, York 
Hall, Geisel Library, Canyon 
Vista, weren’t set aside for when 
you could actually use them. 
And that thought enrages me in 
a way that feels petty. I paid for 
an in-person education and got a 
foreclosed LED screen. I paid to 
hear, “Times are tough for every -
one right now. ” 
It grows inside me, this anger 
with deep, Kudzu roots. I only 
taste the frustrating dirt when 
I remember its existence, a col -
lection of shame for my anger, and anger for my shame. I do 
get to mourn. I get to be upset 
at the friendships I might have 
made had there been three years 
to make them. I get to be upset 
that they threw me into this situ -
ation, and now have ripped me 
from my cradle just as I snuggled 
into my dusty blanket. 
But I’m nothing if not per -
sistent. I’ve stressed every outlet 
and rubbed every fabric thread -
bare, made friends, made strang -
ers, and in eight short months, I 
will be one degree heavier. I am Foreclosed LED Screens
grateful for this last year, some 
solace in the normalcy and in 
the fifteen minute walks turned 
into ten. I can’t let this fester and 
settle, or it’ll soon tangle weeds 
into my stomach, around my 
lungs, braided through my rib -
cage. How does one maintain a 
garden when it’s introduced to 
invasion? Can both new and old 
coexist, and when does the new 
become the now?
Ask me in 20 years.

Gayla and All That Jazz
BY ERIK WIEBOLDT
/gid00004/gid00016/gid00015/gid00021/gid00019/gid00010/gid00003/gid00022/gid00021/gid00010/gid00015/gid00008/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
Ten years ago, I would have 
never imagined that on a Sat -
urday morning in the middle of 
fall, I would find myself in my 
mother’s dress and heels help -
ing put together a Gayla. That 
day was just as queer as the folx 
who stood by me and showed 
me what pride means. Why did 
I wear the dress? What is a Gay -
la? To answer those questions 
and to get to that monumental 
morning, I first need to share 
my experiences with the North 
County LGBT Center. 
 In 2020, at the end of my ju -
nior year of high school, I came 
to the startling realization that 
the reason why I didn’t find 
my 12 years at Catholic school 
wholly holy was because I was in 
fact, homosexual. It took a while 
to parse out why it took me so 
long to realize that, who I should 
tell, and what it meant for my 
identities and upbringing. When 
I came out to my Mom, who I 
must preface as being as close to 
Sainthood as you can get while 
still having a sense of humor, she 
didn’t know how exactly to re -
spond. She brought me to meet 
Jeri at the North County LGBT 
Center. Jeri has become my rock, 
and I her rockstar. Jeri and the 
rest of the wonderful angels at 
this Center, started me on the 
path of the Gay Agenda that has 
become my sense of self. I never 
knew an organization so foreign 
to me at the time, yet so close 
in proximity could be my new -
found safe place. I’ve worked as 
a volunteer for the center ever 
since and have loved working 
alongside queer folx and my found family. When the Center 
asked me to help out with their 
annual gala, I was elated. 
The theme was “Our Mis -
sion & All that Jazz” (us gays and 
our puns), and I was excited to 
join in the spectacle. But there 
was one problem: I had no jazz 
clothes and neither did my dad 
or brother. So in a moment of a 
genderqueer brain blast I nicked 
some clothes from my mom’s 
closet and set out to help with 
the event in any way I could. 
I brought along my fabulous 
friend, and Roger Revelle Col -
lege sophomore, Mack Caldwell. 
Together, we set out to strut and 
pose, to sashay and shanty, to 
slay and boots throughout this event. In their words, “it was 
the gayest thing I’ve ever experi -
enced, and I’m a nonbinary les -
bian from New Jersey. ” 
Just before the event got 
started, as we were both putting 
on our makeup for show time, I 
noticed someone with a familiar 
face in complete white makeup 
in the corner. I asked, “is that 
Logan?” and it turns out it was. 
Logan is one of the facilitators 
I work with in the Queer youth 
group. I came to realize that he 
was dressing as a nun as part of 
his habit of the Sisters of Perpet -
ual Indulgence. This group was 
completely foreign to me and 
their body of work in San Diego 
merits a deep dive on its own. I was astounded and proud of my 
good friend in learning a new 
aspect of their community ser -
vice and gender expression. The 
night was filled with moments 
like this — of sharing queer joy 
and comradery in a space of free 
expression and support for an 
amazing cause. 
For instance, in a rapid dash 
over the span of one minute, the 
emcee challenged the audience 
to see how much money they 
could donate from their wal -
lets. In just as long as it takes for 
me to realize the punchline of a 
joke, we had raised $1000 for the 
Center. In moments like these, 
where I ran frantically to collect 
bills, dresses flying in the wind, 
heels crushed into the concrete, 
I am reminded of how much 
love our community has for each 
other. This night was also shared 
with important members of our 
community. Mike Levin, repre -
sentative for the 49th congres -
sional district that spans from 
Northern San Diego to Orange 
County, was in attendance, along 
with his group of young, largely 
queer volunteers. Seeing po -
litical support from both Levin 
and the vigor of those that sup -
ported him gave me hope that 
this agenda I’ve dedicated my 
volunteerism to has support 
even in a country and world that 
often tries to undermine and le -
verage our identities. My mom 
and brother also joined the event 
and were simultaneously happy 
for how joyful I was and curi -
ous as to why I stole my mom’s 
dress and how my heels weren’t 
killing me. My brother, Brandon 
Wieboldt, a Sixth College fresh -
man, was happy to help out at 
the Center and demonstrated 
how easy it is to show respect 
and support to our community 
as an ally to it. 
Over the course of my expe -
rience with the Center, I have 
come to understand the impor -
tance of celebrating queer joy 
and of working within the com -
munity outward. I have learned 
that pride is not just a Hot Topic 
slogan, but a sense of belonging; 
to be queer in a space of queers 
means you are all the odd ones 
out, and theres no greater sense 
of belonging than with a com -
munity that will be there for you 
in the good times and the bad.

/T_he Tritons (2–9–5, 1–3–3 Big 
West), coming oﬀ of a big win 
against the University of Hawaii, 
faced oﬀ against California State 
University, Long Beach (5–4–5, 
4–0–2 Big West) at home. It was 
a big opportunity for UC San 
Diego’s women’s soccer to build 
momentum to /f_inish the season 
oﬀ strong. Unfortunately for the 
Tritons, things did not go to plan 
as they fell 1–6 to LBSU. /T_he Tri -
tons were dominated for the ma -
jority of this game, falling behind 
early by three goals in the /f_irst 15 
minutes of play. /T_he Tritons were 
unable to /f_ind their footing in this 
game, leading to such a lopsided 
scoring aﬀair. 
As the game kicked oﬀ, UCSD 
looked ready to take on the chal -
lenge of beating LBSU. In the 2nd 
minute, the Tritons had one of 
their best chances of the game. 
Junior forward Kennedy Carter 
raced down the right wing, beat -
ing her defender and sent a cross 
into the box where it met the head 
of sophomore mid/f_ielder Court -
ney Hilliard, who directed the 
ball just le/f_t of the goalpost. It was 
a great starting point for the Tri -
tons, who looked to come out hot. 
Unfortunately for the Tritons, the 
Beach had other plans.
In the 4th minute, the Beach 
marched down the right side of 
the pitch, creating danger for 
the Triton defense. A poor clear -UCSD Women’s Soccer Falls Flat vs. Long Beach State
62 or 73? Baseball’s Home Run Controversyance caused the ball to land at the 
feet of an CSULB player at the 
right side of the box, where she 
launched a shot across the face 
of the goal scoring to go up 0–1. 
/T_he scoring wouldn’t stop there as 
three minutes later the Beach were 
back in the Tritons box, causing 
trouble oﬀ of a free kick. A header 
hitting the top of the bar unluckily 
bounced right to an CSULB player 
who tapped it into the back of the net giving them a 0–2 lead. Very 
shortly a/f_ter, in the 12th minute, 
the Beach was once again in posi -
tion to score. CSULB ran the ball 
down the right /f_lank to the goal 
line where an LBSU player was set 
up perfectly in the middle of the 
box to tap the ball into the bottom 
right corner of the goal, making 
this game 0–3. 
Fortunately for the Tritons, 
the /f_irst half wasn’t all doom and gloom, as in the 18th minute, Hill -
iard found her way into the box to 
make a cross towards sophomore 
forward Natalie Abel. Abel was 
able to win the ball oﬀ of a de -
fender’s poor touch and put it into 
the back of the net, making the 
score 1–3. /T_he spirits of the crowd 
were li/f_ted for the moment with 
the hope of a comeback in the 
air. Lamentably, that hope would 
be shattered with a goal com -
ing for CSULB only /f_ive minutes 
later. /T_he high line of UCSD was 
beaten with a good through ball 
from the CSULB mid/f_ield, leav -
ing a one-on-one with the goalie 
who couldn’t stop the shot, return -
ing the lead to three for CSULB at 
1–4. /T_he hal/f_time whistle blew 
and it was clear that UCSD was 
unable to deal with any of the 
pressure that CSULB was bring -
ing on them. /T_he Tritons needed 
to make some serious adjustments 
coming out of the half for them to 
have a chance in this game. 
As the second half started, the 
Tritons seemed to come out with 
much better energy and adjust -
ments that allowed them to domi -
nate the /f_irst 25 minutes of the 
half. /T_his created many chances as 
the Tritons had 9 shots on target 
for the second half. With the best 
chance coming in the 60th min -
ute, a cross met the feet of Hilliard 
who had a free shot at goal, but the 
CSULB goalie was able to recover 
in time and make a good save. 
Regrettably for the Tritons, they 
could not convert one of these 
chances to close the score line and build momentum. /T_he Beach was 
able to hold on and take control of 
the game over the last 20 minutes, 
with two goals coming in the 73rd 
and 75th minute, pushing the 
score to 1–6. 
UCSD ended the night down 
big with few positives to take away, 
but the focus is now on the /f_inal 
three games of the season. /T_he 
Tritons now on the road to take 
on California State University, Ba -
kers/f_ield on Oct. 20 at 7 p.m., with 
the hope of /f_inishing the season 
out strong.

In the words of Billy Beane 
from “Moneyball, ” “How can you 
not be romantic about baseball?” 
Although it is now October and 
the MLB postseason is oﬃcially 
in full swing (no pun intended), 
it still feels like we are not talking 
enough about the season Aaron 
Judge just had. Y es, he has cer -
tainly received his /f_lowers from 
the media, Y ankees fans, and all 
baseball fans alike over the past 
month, but there is this sense that 
his accomplishments this year are 
being a bit undervalued in the 
grand scheme of things, so let’s 
talk about why that is.
Starting with the obvious, 
Judge hit 62 home runs this sea -
son, breaking former Y ankees 
out/f_ielder Roger Maris’ Ameri -
can League record of 61 home 
runs in a single season, a record 
that stood for 61 years and one 
that saw Maris break Babe Ruth’s 
prior record of 60 home runs. 
/T_here is certainly some mystique 
attached to the fact that the top 
three American League single 
season home run leaders have all 
set records wearing the pinstripes, 
and as for Judge, in addition to 
setting a home run record, he /f_in -
ished second in the AL in batting 
average at .311, and led his league 
in RBIs with 131. Judge couldn’t 
have had such a remarkable sea -
son at a better time, as heading 
into this year, he turned down a 
seven-year $213.5 million exten -
sion oﬀer reportedly made by the 
Y ankees during the oﬀseason. Af -
ter the year he’s had, it’s safe to say 
that he made the right choice bet -
ting on himself as he will probably 
have an additional hundred mil -
lion attached to his new contract 
oﬀer this coming oﬀ-season.
Aside from the incred -ible numbers and the lucrative 
deal coming Judge’s way, he has 
achieved baseball immortality. 
He has gained a level of admira -
tion that so few have seen, though 
we still aren’t giving him enough 
praise, and there are a few contrib -
uting factors to this. Judge now 
holds the single season American 
League home run record, how -
ever, the number 62 has already 
been surpassed on the home run 
list a few times, albeit controver -
sially in each of those instances. 
Going back to the 1998 season, 
Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa were part of a home run chase 
that took the nation by storm, as 
McGwire /f_inished the year with 
70 home runs and Sosa with 66. 
/T_he following season, McGwire 
/f_inished with 65 and Sosa /f_inished 
with 63. /T_his time is now known 
as the “steroid era, ” in which a 
number of MLB players, includ -
ing McGwire and Sosa, took per -
formance enhancing drugs and 
found success with hitting the 
ball harder, pitching with higher 
velocity, and preventing injury by 
way of doping.
Following the expiration of Major League Baseball’s collective 
bargaining agreement at the end 
of the 1993 season, and failing to 
reach a new agreement that oﬀsea -
son, the entire organization went 
on strike in the last third of the 
1994 season, scrapping that year’s 
World Series as a result. Many fans 
expressed their disappointment in 
the organization by refusing to 
attend games or watch them on 
television for an extended period 
of time. Several years a/f_ter this 
dark time for the sport, a number 
of fans began to come back to the 
games and tuned in as they grew invested in the home run records 
that several of these players were 
setting. In 2001, Barry Bonds hit 
a ridiculous 73 home runs, the 
most that any player had hit in a 
single season; however, he too has 
become one of the most notorious 
/f_igures of that era for being linked 
to taking steroids.
So now here we are. Similar to 
1994, although not as drastic, we 
are fresh oﬀ an oﬀseason that saw 
another work stoppage for sev -
eral months. We were fortunate 
enough to have a 162-game season 
this year, but we were especially 
fortunate to witness the legendary 
season that Aaron Judge had. Now 
it is time to ask the controversial 
question: Who is the home run 
king? /T_here are plenty of fans who 
acknowledge Bonds as both the 
single season record holder as well 
as the all-time leader with his 762 
career home runs. /T_here are also 
plenty of fans who think Hank 
Aaron is the all-time leader at 755 
and now believe that Judge is the 
single season home run king at 62, 
because of their lack of association 
with performance enhancers. As a 
result, the title of “home run king” 
is now viewed as entirely subjec -
tive in the eyes of many fans.
As we sit here today, what ev -
ery baseball fan can agree on is 
that we are all grateful to have a 
player like Judge at this time. He 
has earned all the respect he has 
received, and he certainly has 
earned what will be a he/f_ty pay 
raise that would make Sosa, McG -
wire, and Bonds all blush.
