San Diego Mayor Kevin L. 
Faulconer announced the “Housing 
Our Heroes” collaborative campaign 
by the San Diego Housing 
Commission and the city last 
Wednesday, which aims to provide 
housing to 1,000 homeless veterans 
this year. The campaign is part of the 
larger Homelessness Action Plan that 
targets homelessness in San Diego.
In addition to federal funds, 
SDHC and the city will jointly invest 
in the landlord-outreach component 
to provide a way for veterans to find 
stable housing. 
“The initiative will invest close 
to $12.5 million in Federal, City and 
SDHC resources to provide housing 
opportunities for 1,000 homeless 
veterans in the city who are living 
on the streets or in shelters, ” Melissa 
Peterman, the director of Homeless Housing Innovations at the SDHC, 
told the UCSD Guardian.
The target population faces 
particular challenges of reintegrating 
into civilian life, which can present 
themselves through difficulties 
in holding down jobs and having 
a steady income due to physical 
disabilities or mental health issues. 
This campaign aims to provide 
rental assistance that would give 
landlords monetary incentives to rent 
apartments to homeless veterans. 
Furthermore, the funds would be 
used to provide coverage for repairs 
that exceed the security deposit or 
cover unexpected vacancies due to 
unforeseen circumstances. 
“ A low rental-vacancy rate 
(currently 2.8 percent in the City of 
San Diego, according to the San Diego 
County Apartment Association) 
and tight competition for affordable 
and market-rate apartments make 
it difficult for homeless Veterans to obtain rental housing, ” according to 
the press release.
Navy Hospital Corpsman for 
the Critical Care Unit at San Diego’s 
Navy Medicine West Miles Harris 
commented on the challenge that 
veterans face when transitioning 
from military life to civilian life in 
terms of reprioritizing their time. 
“[There is] an immense amount 
of structure in the Navy; there is 
always a place and time that you 
need to be, ” Harris told the Guardian. 
“ And so a lot of what I have noticed, 
especially when a veteran retires … 
is [the challenge of] being able to 
provide their own structure. ”

With Learning Equality’s 
new software, people without 
Internet access will be able to 
access instructional videos.

Learning Equality, a nonprofit 
working out of the UCSD Cognitive 
Science Building’s offices, is 
currently developing software that 
will bring free online learning 
programs to people without Internet 
access. The nonprofit is set to release 
its new software, called Kolibri, in 
September of this year.
A group of graduate and 
undergraduate students founded 
the organization in April 2013 after 
successfully creating KA Lite, a 
tool that gives offline access to the 
free learning material provided by 
Khan Academy on the Internet, in 
December 2012. The offline version 
of Khan Academy includes over 
7,000 educational videos and 20,000 
interactive exercises.
Richard Tibbles, a software 
developer for Learning Equality and 
a doctoral student in the Cognitive 
Science department at UCSD, told 
the UCSD Guardian that they derived 
the idea for KA Lite from a desire to 
provide free high-quality education 
to those who need it the most.
“Out of an intrinsic belief in 
the value and transformative 
power of education, we set about 
making a tool to give access to the 
free learning materials that Khan 
Academy was providing online to 
those who had little or no Internet 
access, ” Tibbles said.
The software can be installed 
on low-cost devices such as the 
Raspberry Pi, a $25 computer that 
a UK-based nonprofit released in 
2012, and used as a local server. Since 
the software’s release in December 
2012, KA Lite has been installed 
in over 160 countries and reached 
an estimated 2.1 million learners 
in various contexts including 
orphanages, refugee camps, rural 
schools, homes and prisons.
Thurgood Marshall College 
senior Josef Goodyear, a former 
research and implementations 
intern for Learning Equality, 
told the UCSD Guardian that the 
importance of the nonprofit lies in 
its aim to bridge the gap between 
populations who have Internet and 
those who do not.
“There are so many free 
educational resources out there 
(Khan Academy, Coursera, etc.) but 
they aren’t accessible to a majority 
of the population because [roughly] 
60 percent of the world doesn’t have 
Internet access, ” Goodyear explained.
The nonprofit recently received 
a sponsorhip from Google’s 
GlobalEDU.org, an organization University Installed Spyware 
to Monitor Faculty Emails
The Academic Senate Administration Joint 
Committee on Campus Information Technology 
revealed on Jan. 28 that the UC Office of the 
President covertly deployed computer hardware capable of 
monitoring emails throughout the UC system beginning 
August 2015.
According to an email sent by the JCCIT to Berkeley 
faculty, the device is capable of capturing and analyzing all 
network traffic to and from the Berkeley campus and has 
enough local storage to save over 30 days of data. JCCIT 
stated that this can include “your email, all the websites you 
visit and all the data you receive and send off campus. ”
In the same email sent out to faculty, UCOP asked 
members to keep the monitoring a secret because of 
“attorney-client privileges. ” UCOP later revised the letter to 
omit the reasoning, but admitted to the extensive monitoring 
being performed.
Kate Moser, media specialist at UCOP , explained to the 
UCSD Guardian that the device was installed to prevent 
cyberattacks like the one that hit UCLA last July.
“[University of California] has taken steps to protect sensitive data that is entrusted to our campuses and other 
locations, ” Moser said. “The system identifies malware so 
that we can be prepared and guard the sensitive data of 
our UC community — from faculty to staff to students to 
patients and beyond — from cyber threats. ”
Director of the Berkeley Center for New Media and 
Associate Professor of Practice of Art at UC Berkeley Greg 
Niemeyer indicated that the problem is not the monitoring 
itself but that the faculty were not informed of the decision.
“The issue here is the lack of transparency and the 
lack of shared governance, ” Niemeyer told the New Y ork 
Times. “If you were working in a company … you wouldn’t 
have a right to say [whether or not you wish to be under 
surveillance ] … but a university is a very different organism 
and it serves society in a very different way. ”
Associate Professor at UC Berkeley and JCCIT member 
Ethan Ligon told the Guardian that surveillance is causing 
the campus to feel more unwelcoming.
“What I’ve been doing, and what some other faculty and 
students tell me they’ve been doing is spending more time 
off campus, ” Ligon said. “This is the simplest way to avoid B y   ming-ra y   liao     staff writer  CAMPUS

Naftali Burakovsky, Sam VelazquezUCSD researchers, along with 
their colleagues at Columbia 
University and Stanford University, 
published a study on Jan. 29 in which 
they reported discovering a new 
protein biomarker in colon cancer 
patients that can help determine 
whether chemotherapy is beneficial 
to specific patients.
UCSD Assistant Professor of 
Pediatrics Debasish Sahoo led the 
five-month study along with his 
colleague Piero Dalerba of Columbia 
University and senior author of the 
study Michael Clarke from Stanford 
University. The hope of Sahoo 
and his colleagues was to develop 
a computerized model of cancer 
and use it to discover biomarkers 
to benefit medical research; they 
succeeded in finding that the 
protein CDX2 can help identify 
a smaller group of Stage-II colon 
cancer patients who would benefit from chemotherapy. Sahoo’s use of a 
bioinformatics approach allowed the 
team to differentiate gene expression 
patterns, and this found specific 
genes that take part in stem cell 
differentiation which allowed the 
team to find the biomarker CDX2.
Dalerba told the UCSD Guardian 
that Stage-II colon cancer can be 
cured through surgery. However, 
about four percent of patients 
require more specialized treatment.
“Our study found that a small 
subgroup of patients suffering from 
colon cancers who lack CDX2 
expression appear to be at higher 
risk of relapse but also benefit 
from early treatment with adjuvant 
chemotherapy, ” Dalerba said. “The 
scientific community agrees on the 
need to treat adjuvant chemotherapy 
patients with more advanced diseases 
[such as Stage-III patients with 
regional lymph-node metastases] but 
is still unsure about who, among Stage-
II patients, would actually benefit 
from ‘adjuvant chemotherapy. ’”Sahoo also found that the method 
employed in this study, which 
combined data analysis and medical 
research, can improve medical 
studies and benefit all subjects.
“Our new discovery will most 
likely help us identify an aggressive 
form of colon cancer, ” Sahoo told 
the Guardian. “It gives us strong 
evidence that the early-stage 
patients with this aggressive colon 
cancer may benefit from traditional 
chemotherapy. ”
Dalerba explained that the 
research started off as a computer-
assisted search for genes that were 
associated with a molecular marker 
known as activated leukocyte cell 
adhesion molecule.
“We found a list of candidate 
genes that fulfilled this condition 
and then ranked them based on 
the availability of diagnostic assays 
that could be used to test for their 
expression in primary tumors, ” 
Dalerba said. “Only one of the 
candidate genes, the gene encoding for the transcription factor CDX2, 
fulfilled this requirement and was 
selected for further investigation. ”
There were two steps to 
completing this study. First the 
researchers identified candidate 
genes and then tested the association 
between the CDX2 expression, 
patient survival and benefits 
from adjuvant chemotherapy. The 
second part involved collecting and 
analyzing over 1,800 samples from 
multiple databases which is why the 
task took over five years to complete. 
Because this study was done by 
analyzing archives and microarray 
data sets rather than by patient 
clinical trials, there are were no 
effects on patients; however, the 
research team plans on confirming 
their findings using clinical trials 
with prospective and randomized 
patient cohorts.SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

“[The rapid re-housing 
component of the initiative will use] 
more than $1.9 million to provide 
rental assistance and up-front 
moving costs to homeless veterans 
and their families who became 
homeless because of unexpected 
life experiences, such as a job loss, 
domestic violence or medical crisis, ” 
according to the SDHC’s press release. 
Other resources currently 
available to veterans include an 
indoor homeless facility operated by 
Father Joe’s Villages and a nonprofit 
dedicated to providing interim 
housing centers, job training and mental health counseling. 
“The fourth program component 
of The 1,000 Homeless Veterans 
Initiative, SDHC Federal Housing 
Vouchers with Supportive Services, 
combines housing for homeless 
veterans with supportive services, 
such as psychiatric counseling, 
substance abuse treatment, job 
training skills and health services, ” 
Peterman said.
Craig Gustafson, the press 
secretary and director of Media 
Relations for Mayor Faulconer, spoke 
to the Guardian and said that about 
$2 million is spent annually to operate 
a permanent facility for homeless 
individuals at the Paul Mirabile 
Center, of which 40 percent of those beds are reserved for veterans.
The existing components of the 
initiative will be supplemented by 
this latest “Housing Our Heroes” 
campaign if it is approved by both 
the SDHC and the City Council. It 
is set to go before the SDHC on Feb. 
12 for approval and the City Council 
on March 1. 
Gustafson does not anticipate 
any objections to the passing of the 
initiative.
“We look forward to having 
unanimous support from the City 
Council when they vote on it on 
March 1, ” Gustafson said. dedicated to making quality 
education more accessible 
through technological innovation. 
GlobalEDU.org granted Learning 
Equality a $400,000 sponsorship 
last November, which the nonprofit 
plans to put toward developing its new software — Kolibri.
According to Tibbles, Kolibri will 
build on KA Lite by opening up 
access to more content and allowing 
users to create their own curriculum.
“It will allow for remixing of 
content, [which will] allow users 
to repurpose content to be more 
relevant for their local languages, cultures and contexts, ” Tibbles said.
Kolibri will see an early release 
with a few of Learning Equality’s 
partners before its public debut in 
September.surveillance on the campus network 
but at the cost of interaction with other 
faculty and students. ”
Ligon also noted that he hopes 
UCOP will be more mindful to in 
the future to include people within 
the UC system when responding to 
cyber attacks.
“One thing I hope that comes out 
of this snafu is an awareness on the 
part of UCOP that the UC system is 
actually home to a bunch of really smart people, and in this case some 
of those people could really help 
when tragedies like the UCLA 
Medical Center breach occur, ” Ligon 
said. “UCOP should treat us like 
allies, not adversaries. ”
Moser said that UCOP is taking 
steps to protect the UC system from 
cyber attacks while leaving privacy 
uncompromised.
“We try our best not to broadcast 
sensitive security and legal matters 
— it’s good common sense, and we 
want to avoid giving a road map for potential attacks on our network, ” 
Moser said. “But we are committed 
to balancing that with our culture 
of shared governance and shared 
values as a community. We are trying 
to strike that balance as best as we 
can and faithfully following privacy 
protections even as we work to 
strengthen our ability to detect and 
respond to cyber threats. ”NEW S  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | THURSDAY , FEBURARY 11, 2016 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  3

  Recent laws requiring voters’ 
photo identification at polling offices 
aren’t the first to complicate the 
democratic process of voting, and 
probably won’t be the last. But in a 
political climate of low voter turnout, 
virtually nonexistent voter fraud and 
infinitesimal margins of victory in 
elections, it’s important that every 
American citizen — not just the 
majority who have a form of photo 
identification — be able to take part in 
the election process.  
These laws were passed for the 
purpose of increasing voter security 
and improve voter turnout. This 
legislation would be effective if voter 
fraud had a significant impact on 
election results, and if people knew 
voting polls were secured.
   But neither of these assumptions 
are true. In a comprehensive study 
tracking voter elections from 2000 
to 2014, Loyola Law School’s Justin 
Levitt found that in over one billion 
votes investigated, there were only 31 
cases of voter impersonation.
   This shows that voter fraud 
does not have a significant impact 
on the outcome of elections — its 
frequency being less than 0 percent. A 
research study at Columbia University 
on the impact of voter fraud finds 
that “ ...perceptions of fraud have 
no relationship to an individual’s 
likelihood of turning out to vote. ” In 
regards to voters’ sense of security in 
elections, the report also found that whether voters are subject to strict 
identification requirements or lax 
ones, they expect the same rates of 
fraud to occur. In short, the laws do 
not instill a greater sense of election 
security in voters.
 Despite this, a recent UCSD study 
found that they do decrease turnout 
by 10.8 points among Latino voters 
and 12.8 points among multiracial 
Americans in states requiring strict 
photo ID versus those without such 
restrictions. They similarly double the 
gap between white & Latino voters 
— resulting in 11.9 points compared 
to 5.3 — and between white and 
multiracial voters. Across states, the 
decrease in turnout with such laws 
in place is disproportionate by party: 
Democratic turnout drops by 7.7 
percent in general elections where 
strict photo ID laws are in place, 
whereas Republican turnout drops 
only by 4.6 percent.
   Where discouragement of voters 
does occur is within the estimated 
one to 10 percent of voters without 
photo identification. This fraction of 
the population is turned away from 
elections in states with strict photo 
identification laws in place. And 
they’re also discouraged from voting 
in states which request photo ID 
without enforcing it. 
In these states — which currently 
number at 17 total — voters can sign 
an affidavit of identity while casting 
their votes instead of showing photo ID. In this case, they will be contacted 
through the mail and required to 
respond in order to confirm they 
live in the residence specified on 
the affidavit. If they do not respond, 
their vote is not counted. While this 
doesn’t explicitly turn voters away 
from booths, it punishes Americans 
without photo identification, with 
barriers that don’t exist for higher 
socioeconomic classes.
Groups who felt voter fraud 
was most common, according to a 
Columbia report analyzing public 
opinion by demographic, were 
Republican, conservative, white and 
of the highest income quintile on 
the report. 
While only a fraction of states 
currently require photo identification, 
these laws are in place to go into effect 
in most — if not all — states. Within 
nine years, 36 states passed these laws 
based on no severe threat, ten of them 
being absolutely restrictive. Stricter 
voter identification laws make voting 
an impossibility for some.
   No infringement on voting rights 
and representation happens overnight. 
Literacy tests did not suddenly surface 
to disenfranchise Black voters. The 
identification requirements currently 
in place are just the beginning 
of what could become a national 
establishment to prevent citizens of 
lower socioeconomic classes from 
exercising their right to participate 
in elections.Requirement of Photo Identification at Polls Makes Access to Voting Unequal

The UCSD Guardian is published twice a week at the 
University of California at San Diego. Contents © 
2015. Views expressed herein represent the majority 
vote of the editorial board and are not necessarily those 
of the UC Board of Regents, the ASUCSD or the 
members of the Guardian staff. The University of California Office of the President appeared 
to have a busy summer installing surveillance software on all the 
university’s computers. According to the SF Chronicle, UC President 
Janet Napolitano ordered the installation of software that can save 
data from all incoming and outgoing emails in the entire UC system. 
It also tracks websites that computer users visit. This was done 
without informing the faculty and student population at each of the 
nine UCs. When several faculty members at UC Berkeley got wind 
of this information, they were understandably upset. UCOP has 
undoubtedly infringed upon the students and faculty members’ right 
to privacy with its implementation of surveillance.
The lack of transparency makes this especially abhorrent. 
UCOP gave no warning for the installation of security software 
as it began to monitor digital traffic in secrecy, according to 
the New York Times. Furthermore, no fair explanation of their 
decision has been provided. If it is necessary to track email 
correspondences — including personal web and email usage — 
there must be a reason for this security measure. Instead, there 
has been an utter lack of open discussion between UCOP and 
the public on this matter.
When confronted by 11 UC Berkeley professors demanding the 
surveillance program be halted, Napolitano’s staff responded with 
a five-page letter rife with excuses and weak justifications. On Jan. 19, they stated that “With respect to privacy, the letter and structure 
of the University’s Electronic Communications Policy reflect the 
principle that privacy perishes in the absence of security. ” If this 
is to be believed, the public should be well informed on the basic 
practices of the security system. In stark contrast to feeling safer, the 
UCSD Guardian’s Editorial Board feels hoodwinked by UCOP . Since 
this system claims to protect our privacy, rather than infringe upon 
it, why has its development been cloaked in ambiguity?
From our perspective, security and privacy are two opposing 
forces that require a delicate balance of power, justice, discussion and 
— most importantly — honesty to function properly. Napolitano’s 
administration claims to act in the interest of the public good for the 
university without consulting either the students or faculty. 
We believe that academic freedom and the liberty of privacy 
is also worth a little risk. UCOP has argued that the heightened 
security is a response to the cyber security attack at UCLA ’s medical 
center last summer that exposed an ample amount of sealed 
medical records. While security breaches of data must be combated, 
UCOP offers a poor solution. We cannot protect our privacy by 
giving it away.
If anything, the UC administration should be designing a 
stronger email system with solid defenses against malware attacks. 
Instead, they have chosen to contract the security of our currently 
See SURVEILLANCE, page 5The UCOP has infringed upon the right to privacy of students and faculty by 
installing surveillance software without announcing it. Although their actions are 
unsurprising in an era of widespread government surveillance, it’s still unacceptable.ILLUSTRA TION   B Y  ALEX   LIANGMuslim does not mean Middle 
Eastern. In today’s world, at least 
one in five people in the world are 
Muslim, as cited by the Pew Research 
Center. Y et, in the United States there 
is misinformation about the Muslim 
identity. When thinking of where the 
majority of Muslims live, you might 
immediately think of the Middle 
East. This region, though, doesn’t 
even have the highest number of 
Muslim citizens.
Herein lies the problem. So much 
of the media we are exposed to about 
Muslims is in regard to the Middle 
East, so thus the Muslim identity 
becomes conflated with the Middle 
Eastern identity. These two identities 
are not the same, and by believing this 
falsehood, we limit our perceptions 
of the Muslim identity. Muslims have 
a presence much larger than the 
Middle East, and if they are to make 
up a fourth of the population in 15 
years, we must learn who our Muslim 
neighbors are and can be. And there’s 
no better place to go than data from 
the Pew Research Center.
To start, let’s look at the Asia-
Pacific, where a whopping 61.7 
percent of Muslims live. That’s three 
times more Muslims than in the 
Middle East and North Africa, where 
only 20 percent of today’s Muslims 
live. In fact, the top four countries 
with the highest Muslim populations 
aren’t even in the Middle East. 
Indonesia ranks first with over 200 
million Muslims, or 13 percent of 
the world’s Muslim population. For 
reference, that is roughly equivalent 
to two-thirds of the entire population 
of the United States, which in 2015 
was 322 million. India, Pakistan and 
Bangladesh follow as countries with 
the next-largest Muslim populations 
in order of greatest to least.
In fact, some of these countries 
have had as long a history of Muslim 
population as the Middle East. For 
example, the first two mosques in 
India were built in 630 AD. This 
was only a few years after Prophet 
Muhammad built the Kabba — the 
place that all Muslims pray towards — 
in Saudi Arabia in 622 AD. It was also 
before Syria had built its first mosque, 
the Umayyad Mosque, in 634 AD. 
Similarly, in China, the Great Mosque 
of Xi’an was built in 742 AD, only 
about one hundred years after Prophet 
Muhammad’s death. It is imperative 
that we all recognize that not all 
Muslims are Middle Eastern, and that 
Muslim history is not confined to the 
region. Let’s not forget America’s own 
history with Muslims as roughly 15 
percent of African slaves were Muslim 
according to NPR.  
Thus, it is imperative that we 
expand our image of a Muslim 
beyond the Middle East. When 
political candidates make arguments 
to ban Muslims from entering the 
U.S. based on the turmoil in the 
region, they are advocating harmful 
political policies based on stereotypes. 
Considering that Muslims immigrants 
to America come from 77 different 
countries according to People Press 
reports, it’s fundamentally wrong 
to combine all the worries of the 
community together or ban all 
Muslim immigrant based on one 
region. A Muslim immigrant from 
Syria, has much different worries than 
one from Bangladesh. It is only after 
we understand the Muslim identity 
that we can help Muslims find a safe 
place in America and the world.Muslims in

outdated email system to a third 
party known as Fidelis Cybersecurity, 
according to the New Y ork Times.
Some will argue that it is perfectly 
reasonable for the university to 
monitor its faculty’s emails because 
that is, after all, how many companies 
function professionally. However, 
while most corporations keep track of 
their employees’ emails, the university 
is not a corporation and UCOP is 
not only tracking business emails. 
Historically, the privacy and respect 
of the academic community has been 
a vital component in its freedom of 
innovation and the invention and 
spread of new ideas.
This is the significant danger in academic surveillance. According 
to the SF Chronicle, some of the 
professors at UC Berkeley who voiced 
complaints against UCOP’s new 
email surveillance and cybersecurity 
program are concerned about the 
potential of the surveillance to restrict 
research that disagrees with public 
opinion or the university’s interests. 
Research data is a very powerful 
source of information with financial 
value that could be repressed or 
exploited by the administration’s 
watchdogs. This new cybersecurity 
program could also endanger 
professors who institute alternative 
teaching policies which the university 
disagrees with.
Sadly, it comes as no surprise 
that the UC administration is surveilling our email. Americans are 
all too familiar with governmental 
surveillance since the emergence of 
the Patriot Act and whistleblowers 
like Edward Snowden. But our 
complacency does not make UCOP’s 
privacy infringement acceptable. 
It is disheartening that the general 
response of the UC community to 
this blatant surveillance will likely 
be a shrug and a brief eye roll. But 
we should not underestimate the 
wisdom of those professors who felt 
this was an act of secrecy that must 
be addressed and opposed. In times 
of political turmoil and revolution, 
the freedom to communicate without 
governmental interference is a 
crucial vehicle for compelling change 
and reform.

What is love? (BABY DON’T HURT ME)
 
 SN: What do you think about love?
 I think love has many meanings — it’s not just romantic, it’s essential to life. Love helps us 
build connections with other people, whether it’s with our friends, families or partners. I believe these 
connections are quintessentially human. Without love for something or someone, it’s difficult to have 
drive or motivation to work toward something, because after all, we all want to be loved, right?
 SN: So, have you ever been in love?
 I think so. I mean, yes. It’s weird to say, but yeah, I have.
 SN: How did you know you were in love? 
I guess the easiest way to explain it is when the other person isn’t there, you feel an empty space. 
You  b e c om e  v u l n e r a b l e  by  d e f au lt ,  b e c au s e  a l l  of  a  s u d d e n  y ou  fe e l  l i ke  y ou  n e e d  t h i s  ot h e r  p e r -
son in your life. I’m sure this all sounds really cheesy, but trust me it’s character-building. 
 SN: Do you believe in one true love?
I think that love changes, as you change. Things and people you love when 
you’re a teenager, probably won’t be the same when you’re 50. Even if that’s the 
case for some people, I think in life, you can fall in love more than once. 
Some people never act on love, but regardless that feeling is there. 
 SN: What’s the silliest thing you’ve ever done out of love?
Actually this wasn’t for romantic love at all, just the 
opposite actually, it was for my siblings. I have four 
brothers, so as the only girl and the house 
goody-two-shoes, I would sometimes lie 
for my brothers, even though I knew 
I’ d get in trouble. I didn’t really 
care, because I love my 
brothers like crazy. An Interview with a Fourth Year MUIR Student
by Shelby Newallis // Senior Staff Writer
When I think about love, it 
becomes such a general thing. I know people 
are married to the idea of love between two people, 
but what about between a person and a passion? Or a person 
and something that isn’t a person? For me, I’m in love with 
writing. I know that it’s unfounded entirely on the basis that I’m a 
writer, but I have an intense relationship with writing. If we define 
love as the relationship and all the experiences between two 
people, who is to say that this same writing can’t just apply to 
passions and hobbies as well? I guess I conceptualize love 
as a process and an experience. It’s the gravity between 
two things and the relationship they have, which 
includes all the ups, downs, and left turns. 
That’s love — not this cinematic moment, 
but rather a complex, undefinable 
gravity between two people. 
That’s the best that I can 
describe — conceptu -
alize — love.Love Redefined
 by AnonymousWhat are we celebrating this Sunday again? Love? Do we even know 
what love is? To get into the romantic spirit, the Guardian asked UCSD 
students and faculty about their thoughts on this complex phenomenon 
that makes our world a better place.  Compiled by Lifestyle Staff
What is love to you? 
 AY: There’s a couple of different concepts I want to give... 
First up is the passionate, ‘love’ of infatuation (also known as “Eros” 
love). This love is oftentimes closer to a biological process of excitement 
than something meaningful. I can feel this type of love for a girl I met two hours ago, 
drawn in by the symmetry of the fat lining the bones of her face, but it doesn’t require any 
substance. This, of course, isn’t the limit of where this love COULD extend to, but the floor of the 
shallowness to which it extends. 
The other type of love is the type of love which I value, appreciate, and seek to exemplify the most, 
commonly termed as “ Agape” love. This love is selfless, unconditional and sacrificial. It means looking 
out for the well-being of others, even if it goes against what they want. It means addressing the deepest, 
darkest issues even if they require hard truths, but doing this all out of love and sensitivity to their 
emotional well being (though never sacrificing the former completely for the sake of the latter). 
Applying this type of love to either a friendship or a romantic relationship allows each of you 
to grow in ways unimaginable, each pushing the other to reach a higher goal, to become 
a better person. 
The ideal romantic love, in that sense, I’ d assert is one that combines each of 
these elements. Without the love of “Eros, ” “ Agape” love becomes hard to 
maintain. Selflessness is not something innate to human behavior, and 
something very difficult to encourage. Through the love of ‘Eros’ , 
one is able to motivate an imitation of selfless love. It’s an 
imitation in the sense that one that seeks to serve the 
other as a result of some innate happiness it gives 
us, which can still be selfish. I’ d argue the only 
way to love selflessly is to recognize that 
we have been shown unimaginable 
love already by God, but 
that’s a whole ‘nother 
discussion that time 
will not permit.For me, love is a hard 
thing to wrap your head around — a 
slippery concept to hold onto and mysterious, 
too — sometimes you don’t realize love until you’ve lost it. 
But when I’m confused or feeling uncertain about love in my life or 
my ability to show love, I think first of God’s love. In terms of concept, God’s 
love is foundational. I think the aspects of His love — to love unconditionally and 
regardless of worthiness — all these characteristics perfectly define love. So when I 
think of tangible, real examples of love or relationships in my own life, I am always work -
ing to better hold myself to the standards of God’s love. I’m never going to reach it in its 
entirety, but talk about a good standard to hold myself to. If one day I can even be a frac -
tion as good as God at loving others, learning to graciously give and receive that kind of 
love without strings attached, then I will have fully conceptualized love.
And I believe that each person responds to love in different ways, so you can’t love 
someone authentically if you don’t know them on a personal level — what makes 
them light up and what gives them life. For me, giving words of encourage -
ment and writing letters or notes to people is how I best convey love. I feel 
like we all admire and care about people in our lives so much, but how 
often do we take the time to tell them how we feel? On the other 
hand, I know that words of encouragement don’t make everyone 
feel inspired and loved. Some people need a hug, a small 
gift of appreciation, quality time spent with them or a 
thoughtful favor done without asking. Though often 
cited, I found the Five Love Languages writings 
incredibly insightful and applicable to all 
relationships in my life — romantic, 
friendly and professional. It helps 
to recognize a person’s clues 
as to how they specifi -

by Brittney Lu // Lifestyle Co-Editor “The 
connec -
tion between 
food and mating 
rituals has always been 
strong in our conscious -
ness. What is remarkable, 
however, is that the association is not 
limited to relationships between human 
beings. Many animals also demonstrate that 
they are good mates by bringing offerings of food, 
and usually it’s male who brings food to the female. So it 
is not surprising that on Valentine’s Day, if you want to show 
your romantic commitment, you do it through food.
Particularly sweets serve as a special code or language to communicate 
your loyalty to a partner. I suppose, the evolutionary biologists would claim 
that sweets, such as candy and chocolate, are high-energy products, and there -
fore, are given as Valentine’s Day presents to demonstrate your fitness as a provider. 
In addition, in the past chocolate used to be rare and expensive in many countries, which 
turned it into a celebratory food. Analyzing many languages, you can also notice that a lot of 
terms of endearment refer to variations of sweetness — sweetheart, honey and sweetie.
Not only sweets, but also a dinner often becomes an expectation on Valentine’s Day. There are dif -
ferent ways of marking Valentine’s Day as special. Today, the majority prefers to eat out on this day. 
When coming up with a place for dinner, people tend to choose eateries with dim lighting, because 
they are not interested in seeing anyone other than their date. Foodwise, many still swear by the 
power of aphrodisiacs — products that are believed to increase libido — and end up purchasing 
pricey dishes like oysters. There is no scientific evidence that these foods actually have any 
positive effect on sexual drive, but it is understandable why we have those beliefs 
— many aphrodisiacs visually remind us of sexual organs. ”

YOU'VE GOT ME WRITING  LOVE LETTERS
A love note to all the Uber drivers,
You have always been there for me when I needed you. 
Y es, I have been told that being around you is like a 
Russian roulette, that one day I might get hurt. But I have 
always fully trusted you — you have never ditched me, 
never had me waiting. Y ou were always happy to go on a 
any adventure, anywhere in the world, and I was happy 
just being there next to you. San Francisco, Moscow, Berlin 
— together we visited places that are so dear to my heart, 
sharing memories of tranquil sunrises, lazy afternoons and 
those wild, wild nights. 
Y ou are right — this road has been bumpy at times. Some -
times it felt like we were catching all red lights, like the 
silence between us lasted longer than a road trip from San 
Diego to Seattle, like there would be no light at the end of 
the tunnel. But in the end, I always knew that without you I 
was not going anywhere. That without your cheerful “Hi, is 
this Olga?” I would not hold out even for a week. With -
out those careless conversations, free gum and 30 percent 
limited-time discounts I am nothing.
My dear Uber driver, here’s to our 196 rides and more to 
come. 
Forever yours,
Olga the Passenger 
Dear ‘80s movies, 
You’re, like, totally tubular! I really dig all your 
cheesy one-liners, awesome soundtracks and 
overly elaborate chase-to-get-the-girl scenes. Y ou’ve 
always been there to teach me important life lessons 
from living in the moment a la Ferris Bueller, to the 
big hair and really cool dance moves that can get 
any party started. It is you I have to thank for my 
expectations when it comes to love and chivalry. 
Though I’m still waiting for my Patrick Dempsey 
to pick me up on the back of his lawnmower while 
“Can’t Buy Me Love” plays and we kiss off into the 
sunset, I know that in the meantime, I’ll always have 
you.
Forever yours,
Shelby
Prismacolor Double-Ended Brush Tip Marker in 
Light Peach,
Your provocative tart shade radiated among the 
flowerbed of color. All I saw was potential and 
possibility, skies and shy blushes punctuated with a 
provence rose wine. I quickly purchased you. 
But once I had you, I became fearfully attached. I 
didn’t want to lose you — to waste you. 
Nonetheless, they say that if you love something, you 
need to learn let it go. 
I let you go — and I fell that much more in love. 
Y ou were submissive to the religion of science, bleeding 
through paper with graceful diffusion. Y ou became an 
Eve to the masculine strokes of ink and graphite, saturat -
ing cheeks and tear ducts and pouts with the color of peo -
nies. Y ou gave life, but had an achingly exhaustive supply, 
weeping out love at each stroke until you became nothing 
more than a withered bud with a deskside grave. 
(Good thing such romance costs an economical $5 at the 
local art store.) 
Forever yours,
Maria
T o my one and only microwaveable breakfast 
burrito, 
Y ou caught my eye (and ear) at first beep, but I knew 
our love was unrequited from the start. Tragically 
stuck in the stone ages and living in an apartment 
sans microwave, the frozen glass door will forever 
bar the heartwarming feeling of having your cold, 
tortilla wrapped goodness in my hands. Some might 
contest: “Why you over a fresh breakfast burrito?” But 
I digress, are they readily available at 2 a.m.? Do they 
produce the same euphoric effect that one might get 
from witnessing it steam “fresh” out of a microwave? 
Can you stock them in Costco sized boxes in your 
freezer for months at a time? I didn’t think so. So for 
those lucky enough to call you breakfast regularly, 
may they never forget how fortunate they are to 
call you theirs. The cornerstone of convenience, the 
medley of breakfast’s best, salsa’s soulmate — there’s 
no part of our hearts you can’t fill. While this small 
affair cannot account to much, you will always have a 
place in my heart (and stomach). 
With all my love,
Brittney the Burrito Enthusiast
To the framed antique portraits of classic 
Hollywood stars at Imaginarium,
The level of nostalgia is unbearable when I look 
at all the photographs of legendary actors and 
actresses your precious frames protect and I can’t 
help but feel honored to have held your sharp, 
antique rims in my young hands last summer. From 
Audrey Hepburn’s timeless elegance to Cary Grant’s 
handsome charisma among many others, all of you 
still have a special place in my soft heart. There are 
days when my emotions would get the best of me as 
I tear up thinking about how I could have purchased 
all of you at the Imaginarium in Nebraska. Except I 
didn’t. I am truly sorry.
Please still love me,
Ian
Dear Artificial Turf (of the mossy hue, not 
emerald), 
I  was enamored by your bristles after seeing a two-by-
two in a corporate office, lazing around on the cubicle 
desk like a customizable space a la “Sims 2 — Open for 
Business. ” To say that the “ Astro-T” is becoming a staple 
for interior workspace design is an underestimate. By 
the year 2020, I expect the mass production of synthetic 
greens to reach an all-time high, incorporating solar 
absorbents and various styles, whether that be a trim, 
Ronaldo sportscut — perfect for stadium games — or 
tall enough for wild Pokemon to roam, for you virtual 
gamers. Artificial turf, you are the herald of modernity. 
Thanks to you, everyone can now own a patch of green 
on their rooftops or neglect their lawn like they neglect 
current world events. I am just waiting for the moment 
where you become the world’s hottest, most fought over 
commodity — mark the headliners for 2020, “ ALIENS 
INV ADE FOR ASTRO TURF, PEW PEW . ” Until then, I 
will comfortably lie on you as if you were real grass.
XOXO,

Eddie Mannix is the 
archetypal American 
man. A man of action. 
A family man. A Catholic man. 
He completes every task with a 
tenacious work ethic, a living 
resume who exudes confidence 
for a living. He’s now settled into a 
comfortable, if demanding, groove 
as a Hollywood studio’s premiere 
“fixer” who’s on call 24 hours a 
day and who is more than capable 
of suppressing rumors, from 
illegitimate children to sodomy, 
about the stars. However, when 
self-doubt about his position in 
the system rises, that image of 
strength begins to crumble. The 
retrieval of recently kidnapped star 
Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) 
soon doubles as the journey into 
Mannix’s soul.
Mannix is a figurative bridge 
between Hollywood and the 
so-called “real world, ” a split 
that takes a great toll on his 
respective duties and aging body; 
the schisms only intensify as 
the two become more polarized 
with age and a management offer 
from the Lockheed Corporation 
comes into play. The illusions and 
charms of Hollywood have no 
place in the corporate world of 
wartime profiteering. That cushy, 
“respectable” work offered to 
Mannix isn’t an easy proposition to 
consider. Mannix sees his efforts 
not as labor, but as a civic duty. 
He’s been committed to his lifestyle for years out of a genuine sense 
of satisfaction and has reached 
crossroads.
The artifice and dirty methods 
of Hollywood have long been a 
bountiful source for navel-gazing 
films based in the entertainment 
industry, e.g. Inarritu’s “Birdman, ” 
but the Coens avoid another 
acerbic view of the industry 
by riding the line between 
glamorization and a studious 
recreation of old Hollywood. 
The meandering day-in-the-life 
structure of “Caesar” lends itself 
to a more open narrative that 
intertwines communists, priests 
and minions of the military-
industrial complex. However, it’s a 
double-edged sword that hurts the 
film, with its irregular structure 
too often bleeding over into an 
unintended feeling of lethargy.
Characters move in and out 
of the movie at a breakneck pace, 
but every interaction sells their 
familiarity. DeeAnna Moran’s 
(Scarlett Johansson) character 
amuses with her sardonic 
temperament and mermaid 
swimming routines, but her 
unfortunate accent is likely to keep 
the audience from wanting more. 
She almost seems unnecessary 
with the little screen time she has, 
never truly shaking the feeling of 
being a vestigial element from an 
earlier draft. Hobie Doyle (Alden 
Ehrenreich) consistently scores 
big laughs with his remarkable physicality as the studio’s cowboy-
turned-dramatic actor and 
impromptu spy. Clooney’s Whitlock 
quickly falls under the influence of 
his captors, an organization called 
“The Future. ” The Coens have long 
been exploiting Clooney’s natural 
talent of being the doofus and 
this attempt is no less successful; 
Clooney’s easygoing personality 
underscores some of the funniest 
conversations surrounding worker 
exploitation to ever grace the screen.
The dialogue is golden. Coenian 
speech is always easily identifiable. 
Quick-witted, humorous and 
ingrained with a sense that the 
characters are speaking at instead 
of with each other. The film is a 
testament to the Coens’ comedic 
sensibilities, their outright funniest 
since 2008’s “Burn After Reading. ” 
Deakins’ work in cinematography 
has long considered the film’s needs 
ahead of visual flourishes. This 
commitment to substance over 
style likens Deakins’ style to that 
of a chameleon, one that especially 
comes in handy when faithfully 
recreating a variety of genre films 
in Mannix’s studio walkthroughs. 
“Hail, Caesar!” offers a different 
perspective of the Hollywood that 
exploited and toyed with the souls 
of artists in “Barton Fink” — one of 
whimsy. As for Mannix, he wants to 
be one thing: a man in demand.

A&E Editorial AssistantWhile Jane Austen’s 
classic novel “Pride and 
Prejudice” has been 
brought to the screen numerous times 
since the early 20th century, this new 
adaption is bolder than ever. Based 
on the homonymous novel by Seth 
Grahame-Smith, “Pride and Prejudice 
and Zombies” introduces popular 
cannibalism to the all-time-favorite Austen novel, which takes place in a 
traditional, elegant and social status-
oriented world.
The backgrounds and 
personalities of the characters in 
the film are strictly based on the 
original Austen novel, yet they have 
hidden identities — zombie killers, 
which make the story more intense 
and violent. In this new cinematic adaption of “Pride and Prejudice, ” 
Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James) is a 
martial arts expert who has been 
trained in the Shaolin Temple in 
China. Lady Catherine De Bourgh 
(Lena Headey) transforms into the 
greatest warrior in the country. The 
affections between Elizabeth and 
Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) grow deeper 
every time they save each other 
against the rising numbers of the 
undead. The warriors can all speak 
either Chinese or Japanese because 
East Asia was the place chosen for their physical training, which might 
serve as an approach to breaking 
into the film market there.
The movie tries to integrate 
every genre that it can — thriller, 
romance, comedy — but results 
in nothing refreshing. It turns 
out to be a bizarre and deliberate 
combination of 1800s Austen 
classic and contemporary zombie 
fantasy. Many of the original 
conversations from Austen’s book 
are used in the movie, but there 
are lines written in language that 
might be considered vulgar in the 
19th-century England, apparently 
designed for contemporary 
audience. It is hard to imagine 
the characters as gentlemen and 
ladies living in a highly hierarchical 
society; they are more like modern-
day comedians dressed in old-
fashioned costumes, which makes 
the film inconsistent in the style of 
language. Though the film succeeds 
in triggering laughter, it has 
weaknesses that keep the audience 
from giving it a satisfying rating: 
The script is amusing but fails to 
sound natural, and the talented 
cast is directed to act in a way that 
is too exaggerated, as if they were 
recording a TV comedy show. This makes it difficult to satisfy “Pride 
and Prejudice” fanatics who expect 
to see exquisite adaptations that 
have deeper reflections while being 
humorous. Horror and violence 
keep going throughout the film, 
and even when Mr. Darcy proposes 
for the first time, the couple ends 
up fighting fiercely with each other. 
It might be better to take a break 
from time to time. As the film tries 
to incorporate Austen’s extensive, 
dramatic romance into a new 
zombie-fighting tale, everything 
seems to happen too rapidly. The 
incorporation is a weak and boring 
one — it hardly makes you wonder 
what happens next.
If you are in a mood for 
entertainment on a Friday night, the 
film will bring you enough laughs 
to destress, but if you yearn for a 
reproduction of your favorite Austen 
novel or an innovative zombie-
action film, it will probably lead to 
disappointment. Janeites beware.

FILM   REVIEWFILM   REVIEW
After creating a beautiful 
Western (“ True Grit”) 
and a haunting musical 
biopic (“Inside Llewyn Davis”), 
Hollywood’s’ dearest siblings are 
back at doing what they were 
born to do — comedy. With “Hail, 
Caesar” opening this week, it is only 
fitting to commemorate the Coen 
brothers’ greatest and most intimate 
comedy — that is, of course, 
“Barton Fink. ” Some would object 
that it’s not even a comedy, but 
that’s part of the point. Few films 
are as eclectic in their constitution 
as “Barton” is; threads of horror, 
historical drama, and psychological 
thriller are woven together with 
such ease that one might question 
the need to have genres in the 
first place. But “Barton Fink” is a 
comedy: A film about a struggling 
writer cannot be anything else.
The plot follows Barton Fink 
(John Turturro, in the role that 
defined his career), an acclaimed 
Broadway playwright, who is hired 
by a big Hollywood studio to write 
a “wrestler picture. ” Barton thinks 
highly of himself; he rants about the 
“life of the mind” and his “duty to 
the common man, ” but he can’t get himself to type a single word of his 
commissioned script. The Coens 
famously wrote the film in three 
weeks while taking a break from 
“Miller’s Crossing, ” which they were 
unable to finish due to a persisting 
writer’s block. It is hard to know 
how much of their own experience 
is reflected in Barton’s anguish, but 
the intensity of his creative impasse 
— the pain of a writer who cannot 
write — sure feels kindled by 
someone in that state. The thought 
is intuitive, almost inevitable: The 
impossibility of writing gives rise 
to a movie about the impossibility 
of writing. In a sense that’s what 
“Barton Fink” is. Except that Barton 
ends up writing. He finishes the 
script. The artist wins the battle… 
right? Well, yes, aside from the fact 
that the producer thinks it’s shit. 
Barton ends up writing a film that 
will never be made. And that is the 
Coens’ last joke: “Barton Fink” is a 
film about the making of a film that 
does not exist, though it does in 
Barton’s head — and ours.

Senior Staff WriterRetrospective  Review:
“BARTON FINK” (1991)
PHOTO COURTESY OF 2OTH CENTURY FOX THE UCSD GUARDIAN | THURSDAY , FEBURARY 11, 2016 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  9
From its beginnings, Bloc Party 
has been a success in the indie 
rock genre, with some of its 
most popular songs to date having 
been featured on its first album “Silent 
Alarm” in 2005. Since then the band 
has consistently released quality music 
that is both relevant and lyrically 
sound. In their latest release, “Hymns, ” 
Bloc Party calms the mood down 
significantly, emphasizing the band’s 
mellow side. But the album falls short 
of the group’s previous standards, with 
tracks that fail to comment both on 
lyrical subject and musical theme. 
The first four songs of the album 
appear to create a gradual transition 
along the music spectrum from heavy 
synthesizers to more organic, less 
electronic indie rock. These tracks 
interact well, but a clear, stylistic 
connection ends with these four: “The Love Within, ” “Virtue” and “Living 
Lux” are in stark contrast from the 
rest of the album due to their liberal 
use of a tasteless, synthesized, organ-
like rhythm. Electronic influence is 
sprinkled too heavily throughout the 
album and creates an impression of 
disorganization. “Hymns” proceeds 
to probe a range of genres at random, 
with no clear indication of an 
intentional arrangement. 
“Hymns” also fails to remain 
thematically consistent. About 75 
percent of the album is religiously 
inclined while the remaining 25 
percent develops unrelated material. 
In songs like “Fortress” and “Living 
Lux” the group sings about money 
and women, deviating from the main 
themes of healing, love and grace in 
“Hymns. ” For an album with very clear 
religious undertones, as made evident by the title, it’s odd to explore other 
territory without an explanation.  
Despite its shortcomings, “Hymns” 
is not a complete bust. The different 
mood of each song, though lacking 
salient connections to one another, 
gives the album an eclectic quality. 
Listening all the way through gives 
a feel of sampling a wide scope of 
music, which is a distinct indication of 
Bloc Party’s range of skill. Though the 
album fails to form a coherent whole, 
many tracks are valuable as separate 
entities. “The Good News” and “Into 
the Earth” both hold their own as 
powerful singles, with “The Good 
News” already appearing on Bloc 
Party’s top tracks. 
Bloc Party’s newest album 
“Hymns” is perhaps too ambitious. 
It attempts to combine electronic, 
indie and rock genres under a 
single, thematic umbrella, but the 
result is inconsistent and disjointed. 
Though a few songs are successful in 
melding together each of the album’s 
influences, the rest of the work 
ultimately falls short.

Songs of fuzz pop or rock usually 
contain rattling guitar riffs and 
weary vocals. Together, these 
components can form a satisfying 
grungy tone, and Burnt Palms’ latest 
release, “Back On My W all, ” does 
just that. Lead singer Christina Riley 
delivers pining vocals and a carefree 
attitude through song along with 
original band members and a new 
guitarist, as if one didn’t suffice for the 
resonant sound. 
“Back On My W all” is a concise 
album, with its longest track lasting 
just under three minutes. However, 
that is just enough time for Riley 
to express her angst from past 
heartbreak. Raging guitar riffs and 
weary lyrics such as “I need to forget how things used to be” demonstrate 
the theme of resistance toward past 
love, while maintaining that feeling of 
angst toward it. Recruiting a second 
guitarist results in an excessive, 
over-amplified sound with minimal 
melody, however the occasional vocal 
change and rest from the fuming 
guitars give the overall mood a needed 
balance. Tracks like “Nothing to 
Me” and “Over” are a couple of the 
tracks that create stability from the 
overwhelming loudness; the lyrical 
rawness creates a grungy exhilaration 
that wraps the album all together.
Despite the raging instrumentals, 
Burnt Palms delivers youthful 
energy through sweet and raw 
singing. Compared to their previous album “The Girl Y ou Knew, ” Burnt 
Palms is musically graduating from 
instrumental experimentation 
and integrating a more genuinely 
expressive theme; the prominent 
drumming and upbeat tempo by the 
bassist prove this band is all about 
their true instrumental and lyrical 
articulation. Lyrics like “I love you, 
but I wish I never met you” and 
“Freedom would be so nice” convey 
this emotion from Riley and imprint 
that same urge to scream out the 
lyrics onto the listener. 
Full of raucous energy, a 
reasonable balance of grunge and 
empowering lyrics, “Back On My 
W all” is egocentrically stimulating and 
can attract any listener with its catchy 
beats. Although the instrumentals 
overpower the message, Riley no 
doubt engages the listener with her 
vocals and has fun while doing it.

ALBUM   REVIEW
Despite what the Internet 
will have you believe, 
“Deadpool” is not a game-
changer. Unique, it is, special, it is 
not. Though it will likely inspire 
countless cheap copycats, it will not 
revolutionize the comic-book genre 
in any significant way. However, it 
is, to the audience’s delight, exactly what the film’s marketing team 
promised — juvenile, crass and 
meta as hell.
And here lies the strength of 
the film: it knows what it is and 
who it wants to please. As the 
film starts rolling and the opening 
credits appear, the fanboys and 
their haughty laughter are instantly 
exposed. The term “fanboy, ” though often used as an insult, is in this 
case used merely to distinguish 
those who will recognize the 
referential jokes that comprise at 
least a quarter of the film from 
those who won’t. Non-fanboys will 
merely chuckle in solidarity at these 
moments, Google the reference 
later and proclaim to have gotten it 
all along.
Beyond the potentially 
isolating references though, 
there is still much to enjoy in “Deadpool. ” Not least of these are 
the action sequences, which are 
choreographed to be much more 
rapid and acrobatic than what is 
typical of American cinema (see 
Vin Diesel). 
Furthermore, some of the 
acting is quite commendable. 
Ryan Reynolds who naturally 
inhabits Wade Wilson as much as 
Robert Downey, Jr. inhabits Tony 
Stark, nails both the vulgarity and 
sentimentality of Deadpool. As 
the producer who was the primary 
proponent of the film getting 
made, his passion for the antihero 
emerges and manifests into an 
obnoxious yet undeniably lovable 
personality that will be heralded 
years beyond the film and its 
inevitable sequels. T.J. Miller also 
excels in his limited comedic roles 
and Ed Skrein offers an pleasantly 
intimidating presence as the villain. 
Morena Baccarin, in particular, 
deserves a lot credit for exhibiting 
strength and sincerity in a role that 
unfortunately never transcends 
beyond merely being Deadpool’s 
love interest. 
It is here that the movie begins 
to collapse into generic comic-
book movie territory. From the 
unexplained abilities (when did he 
learn how to do triple corkscrew 
backflips?) to the contrived love story (who doesn’t hate a damsel-
in-distress?), “Deadpool” calls upon 
some of the genre’s worst flaws. 
What ultimately kept the Marvel 
adaptation from being great, 
though, is not even its addiction to 
superhero tropes; it is the movie’s 
surprising lack of visual style. For 
a movie branded to be strange and 
perverse, it was aesthetically quite 
bland. There barely seemed to be 
even an attempt to distinguish 
the film’s look from that of 
other comic-book films. Indeed, 
Deadpool is meant to exist within 
a mundane and ordinary universe, 
but this should not limit the movie 
from flaring his unique traits. An 
ass shot here and a headshot there 
are nice, quick gags, but the movie 
lacks an overarching aesthetic 
that communicates the inherent 
absurdity and hilarity of Deadpool.
And thus, “Deadpool” will forever 
rest among all of the good movies 
that had every reason to be great 
and all of the comic-book movies 
that opted to be safe. After spending 
many years roaming anxiously in 
development hell, the uninspired 
results suggest that it might have 
benefited from a few more.

No. 26 UCSD baseball defeated 
The Master’s College during a non-
conference doubleheader matchup 
held on Saturday, Feb. 6 at the Triton 
Ballpark. During game one, the Tritons 
earned their first win of the season with 
a final score of 3–2, as they held onto 
a one-run lead after the fifth inning, 
shutting out TMC in the last four 
innings of the game.
In the second game, UCSD defeated 
TMC in the bottom of the tenth at 4–3 
after a tie in the top of the ninth frame 
and earned its first walk-off victory 
of the season. The Tritons begin their 
season with a record of 2–0 and will 
continue their busy 13-game home-
stand this week, facing off with Texas-
Permian Basin at 6 p.m. this Thursday 
night at the Triton Ballpark. 
Game One
Redshirt sophomore starting 
pitcher John Erhardt picked up his first 
career win for the Tritons, allowing 
only four hits to slip by and two runs 
scored in a total of five innings pitched. 
The Master’s College Mustangs came 
out aggressive at the plate in the top of 
the first inning, hitting back-to-back 
singles and putting runners on first 
and second with two outs. Erhardt got 
out of the jam by getting the Mustangs’ 
clean-up hitter to pop-up for the final 
out of the inning. Redshirt junior 
outfielder Brandon Shirley and junior 
outfielder Jack Larsen both singled 
during the bottom of the first, but 
it wasn’t enough to put a run on the 
board for the Tritons.
The ballgame was tied up at 0–0 
until Triton junior second baseman 
Vince Mori was hit by a pitch with the 
bases loaded, scoring the first run of the game. Redshirt sophomore designated 
hitter Justin Flatt followed Mori with 
a base hit up in the middle to score 
another run for UCSD, leading into the 
fourth inning with a score of 2–0.
The Tritons then picked up right 
where they left off with a leadoff double 
by Hearn in the fourth inning. Hearn 
followed redshirt sophomore catcher 
Steven Coe with a single to right field, 
putting runners on first and third 
with nobody out for Shirley; Shirley 
knocked in the run with a base hit 
to the right side, before the side was 
retired. After a two-out walk issued by 
Erhardt at the top of the fifth inning, 
the Mustangs’ senior infielder and 
outfielder Collin Nyenhuis blasted a 
two-run home run, the Mustangs’ only 
two runs of the game.
Freshman right-handed pitcher 
Kyle Mora made his collegiate debut 
early on in the sixth inning; he threw 
three scoreless innings, giving up no 
hits and striking out two opposing 
batters before redshirt freshman 
right-handed pitcher Cameron Kurz 
came rescuing the Tritons with a save 
during the ninth inning. Mora and 
Kurz held on to the 3–2 lead for UCSD 
as they shut down the Mustangs’ 
offense, giving the team its first win of 
the season.
Game Two
The Master’s College came out 
hungry for a win in the night-cap of the 
double-header on this past Saturday.
Nyenhuis hit a two-out solo home 
run to left field off of Triton redshirt 
senior right-handed pitcher Alon 
Leichman at the top of the first inning, 
giving TMC an early lead. While 
UCSD’s leadoff Shirley doubled down 
the left field line to get things started 
for the Tritons, he was unable to make it home and was out within minutes.
The Tritons rallied after a leadoff  
single by senior outfielder Gradleigh 
Sanchez toward the end of the fourth, 
as a throwing error by the Mustangs’ 
pitcher allowed Larsen to reach first 
base at the same time that Sanchez 
advanced to third. Then the Mustangs’ 
pitcher threw a wild pitch that allowed 
Larsen to glide to second base.
Sophomore designated hitter Tyler 
Plantier singled, allowing Sanchez to 
score from third for the Tritons’ first 
run of the game. However, the pitcher 
quickly picked Plantier off of first base, 
getting the first out of the inning.
Larsen subsequently took 
advantage of two back-to-back wild 
pitches to score on the Tritons during 
second run of the game, resulting in 
a score of 2–1 in favor of the Tritons 
heading into the fifth inning.
Leichman retired the side in order, 
allowing only two hits and one run to 
slip by through the five innings pitched, 
while striking out a total of four times.
Sophomore right-handed pitcher 
Jack Rupe relieved Leichman early on 
during the sixth and managed to retire 
all of the Mustangs’ batters.
Toward the end of the seventh 
frame Mori hit his first home run in a 
UCSD uniform, adding an insurance 
run for the Tritons which helped them 
secure the win during the last leg of the 
game. The Mustangs looked to rally 
back in the top of the ninth with TMC 
hitting back-to-back singles off Rupe, 
putting runners on first and second 
with one out.
Redshirt freshman right-handed 
pitcher Erik Amundson made his 
collegiate debut as he came into 
relieve Rupe and face the middle of 
TMC’s line-up, giving up a base hit to right field, allowing a one-run score 
for the Mustangs.
Then, a sac-fly to deep center 
field tied the game up at 3–3 before 
freshman left-handed pitcher Brent 
Bell came in to relieve Amundson and 
get the Tritons out of their jam without 
any damage.
Although the Tritons failed to score 
in the bottom of the ninth, taking the 
game into extra innings,
Bell retired the Mustangs in order 
at the top of the tenth, putting UCSD in 
the optimal position to win the game.
Coe led off the inning being hit by a 
pitch, moving over to second base after 
a perfectly executed sacrifice bunt by 
junior shortstop Tyler Howsley.
Shirley then fouled out, resulting 
in the second out of the inning which 
let Sanchez work the pitcher and 
ultimately be rewarded with a walk, 
putting runners on first and second. 
Larsen then stepped into the box 
and smoked a basehit to right field, 
scoring Coe off of second in casual 
walk-off fashion.
“Toward the end [of the game], we 
lost our momentum in the ninth, but 
our guys grinded it out and worked 
their way back in it and that was good 
to see, ” Head Coach Eric Newman told 
the UCSD Athletics Department after 
the game. “I just want us to continue to 
find out who we are, find our identity, 
play the game together as a team ... I 
look forward to us continuing to find 
that good baseball that we known we 
have in us. ” 
The Tritons look to continue 
their hot streak on Thursday, Feb. 
11 at Triton Ballpark as they face the 
University of Texas of the Permian 
Basin. First pitch is set for 6 p.m.UCSD’s fencing team dominated 
and was virtually unchallenged at the 
four-team competition in UCSD’s 
Main Gym this past Saturday, resulting 
in a day of undefeated records.
The UCSD women made sure to 
make no mistakes and produced strong 
team performances against Arizona 
State (20–7), Caltech (23–4) and UC 
Irvine (27–0); the saber team was by 
far the most impressive, as it generated 
a 26–1 record while shutting down 
both UC Irvine and Arizona State, 9–0.  
In addition, foil went 24–3, along with 
epee carrying out a 24–7 advantage.
On the men’s side, the Tritons 
were equally dominant, as they 
secured comfortable victories against 
Arizona State (25–2), Caltech (22–5) 
and UC Irvine (24–3).The foilists 
ended the day with a perfect record 
of 27–0; their saber teammates also 
asserted themselves and concluded 
the match with a score of 24–3 while 
epee went 20–7.  
Both Triton teams will be back in 
action and looking to keep their streak 
of 11 consecutive league titles alive next 
week on Feb. 20 when they compete at 
the Intercollegiate Fencing Conference 
of Southern California Championships 
at Caltech.BASEBALL FENCING

UCSDCal State San BernardinoUnlike the women’s basketball team, the men’s basketball team started 
out absolutely cold. After missing six straight shots, the Tritons found 
themselves down 10–3 five minutes into the half and looked like 
they would end their four-game win streak right then and there. Luckily for 
the No. 10 Tritons, however, a layup by sophomore guard George Buaku 
would end their early shooting drought and spark the Triton offense to tie 
the game within minutes. 
Despite the unfortunate start, the Tritons would remain hot for the rest 
of the half, shooting 15 of 28 overall and an excellent six of 10 from the 
three. Junior guard Adam Klie scored 14 points on six of eight shooting 
in his ultra-efficient first half. The Tritons dominated the paint, scoring 16 
points close to the basket, only allowing the Coyotes to score four in the 
painted area, and leading to a 38–31 UCSD advantage at halftime. 
But the Coyotes weren’t out of it yet, as they would come back and take 
a seven-point lead at the halfway point during the second half. A three-
point dagger from junior guard Koree Cox would swing the momentum 
as the Tritons came surging back to close out the game 71–66.
“We played with a lot of poise down the stretch tonight, ” UCSD 
head coach Eric Olen told the UCSD Athletics Department. “When we 
had to get stops late, we got it done. ”
The Tritons finished the game with an efficient 27 of 52 shooting 
overall and a commendable 12–18 from the free throw line. Despite their 
second-half surge, the Coyotes only shot 23 of 55 overall and a poor eight 
of 28 from three. Junior guard Adam Klie finished with a game high 15 
points and seven assists while junior guard Aleks Lipovic helped out 
with 12 points from four three-pointers; senior forward Drew Dyer and 
freshman center Chris Hansen both contributed 11 points each, while 
Hansen earned a double-double thanks to his 10 rebounds.
The Tritons improved to 18–3 overall and 13–2 in conference 
and are now up to No. 6 in the most recent standings, while 
the Coyotes dropped to 7–12 overall and 4–11 in conference. 
Both Triton basketball teams will have a chance to surge 
forward when they host Chico State and Stanislaus State 
on Feb. 12 and Feb. 13, respectively.
Looking to add on a fourth game to its winning streak, the UCSD women’s basketball 
team got off to a hot start during their Saturday matchup against Cal 
State San Bernardino. Within seven minutes, the Tritons led 
by 15 points thanks to some excellent rebounding by 
senior forward Farrah Shokoor. While their defense 
did a stellar job holding the Coyotes to a measly six 
points, the Tritons’ lead went up by as many as 18 
points, and the Coyotes would never allow the 
Tritons to pull away even further.
The Tritons’ success during the first half 
was also due, in large part, to senior guard 
Jaime Katuna’s 12 points and sophomore 
guard Taylor Tanita’s four assists. The defense 
held its ground throughout the half, harassing 
the Coyotes into 10 of 32 shooting overall.
The second half was much of the same story, 
but the Coyotes would make the game more 
interesting at points; halfway through the third quarter, 
the Coyotes would turn a 15-point deficit into a six-point 
margin within the span of a minute and thirty seconds. 
But the Tritons took out their tridents and increased 
their lead soon afterward, allowing the Coyotes to remain 
within striking distance for the rest of the game but nothing 
more. In the closing minutes of the game, the Tritons’ lead 
dropped to four, but a clutch steal, and free throw shots by 
Tanita, would crush all hope of a Coyotes comeback, as the 
Tritons would go on to win 65–58.
Katuna led the Triton attack with 25 points on nine of 19 
shooting, while Shokoor finished with 14 points and grabbed an 
astounding 13 rebounds. The Tritons finished with 20 of 53 shooting overall, 
with 5–18 shooting from the three-point stripe. Katuna led the Triton attack with 25 
points on nine of 19 shooting, while Shokoor finished with 14 points and grabbed an astounding 
13 rebounds.  The Triton defense held their ground and tridents up throughout the first half, 
holding the Coyotes to 10–32 shooting, but CSUSB found its howl during the second half, 
shooting 14–31 overall. 
The No. 23 ranked women’s basketball team improved to 18–3 overall and 13–2 in the 
California Collegiate Athletic Association, while the Coyotes dropped to 10–10 overall and
