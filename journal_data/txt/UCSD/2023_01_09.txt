MEN’S BASKETBALL...12CHANCELLOR KHOSLA
Former UC Investigator Alleges he was Fired for Challenging 
Chancellor Khosla
By KAITLIN LEE /gid00015/gid00006/gid00024/gid00020/gid00001/gid00006/gid00005/gid00010/gid00021/gid00016/gid00019/gid00010/gid00002/gid00013/gid00001/gid00002/gid00020/gid00020/gid00010/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00015/gid00021
A former Director of Investigation for the UC O ﬃce of the Presi -
dent has sued the UC Regents and the Chief Compliance and 
Audit O ﬃcer of UC Regents, Alexander Bustamente, for vio -
lating the California Whistleblower Protection Act and for retaliation 
in violation of labor codes. 
/T_he lawsuit states that the investigator, John Torres, became in -
volved in a whistleblower complaint investigation involving Chancellor 
Pradeep Khosla. However, the UC Regents and Bustamente protected 
Khosla by choosing not to allow investigations into gender discrimi -
nation allegations against Khosla and by removing Torres’ submitted 
/f_indings regarding Khosla’s bullying, alcohol use, discrimination, and 
other inappropriate and illegal behavior. 
Beyond that, Torres found there was improper activity within the 
investigation of the 2018 whistleblower report. Torres reported that 
dating around May 3, 2020, Bustamente made several statements about “protecting” Khosla, as well as failing to disclose information about 
Khosla’s alleged alcohol usage and bullying in a letter sent to UC Presi -
dent Janet Napolitano. Bustamente also allegedly attempted to change 
department processes and the format for Charge Letters to circumvent 
the O ﬃce of General Counsel’s UC Whistleblower subject matter ex -
pert Stephanie Lieder. 
Torres reported to UCOP President Michael Drake that he worried 
Bustamente was engaging in retaliation against him for his previous 
disclosures and for working with a di ﬀerent external investigation 
of the ECAS’s practices and policies. When Bustamente and the UC 
Regents found out about this warning, allegedly they imposed new, 
unreasonable working conditions. /T_hey mandated a seven-day turn -
around for completion of all charge and notice letters, and applied 
these new mandates to old letters. Bustamente also allegedly placed 
Torres on a Performance Improvement Plan around Feb. 18, 2021, and 
he informed the plainti ﬀ that this plan was intended to lead to Tor -
res’s termination unless he could take an alternative solution where he 
would resign. Torres believes that this Performance Improvement plan 
was a part of Bustamente’s attempt to retaliate against him.
/T_he UCSD Guardian reached out to UCOP and UC San Diego for 
comments. While UCSD declined to respond, UCOP Associate Direc -
tor of Media Relations Ryan King relayed a statement through email. 
“/T_he University of California is aware of the lawsuit /f_iled in Alam -
eda County Superior Court. We are unable to comment on the specif -
ics of pending litigation concerning employees within the University 
of California O ﬃce of the President,” the statement read. “However, 
we believe the complaint and the associated allegations to be without 
merit and fully expect the facts of the case to demonstrate that no re -
taliation took place and that there is no evidence that improper in -
/f_luence was exerted in previous investigations. /T_he University has full 
faith and con /f_idence in both our o ﬃce of Ethics, Compliance and Au -
dit Services and the San Diego campus leadership.”
/T_he Guardian also reached out to Torres’ representation, Mark 
Quigley and Christian Nickerson from Greene Broillet and Wheeler, 
LLP. /T_hey declined to comment.

SCRIPPS INSTITUTE
Scripps Institute of Oceanography Granted $5.6 Million to Study DDT 
Dumpsite off the Coast of California
By TIANRUI HUANG /gid00020/gid00006/gid00015/gid00010/gid00016/gid00019/gid00001/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) was recently awarded 
$5.6 million of federal funds with the aim to fully characterize the 
dumpsite situation of Southern California’s shores by supporting re -
lated research.
/T_he dumpsite at San Pedro Basin is known to have started around 
the 1940s, caused by local governments and industrial companies, and 
continued until the Ocean Dumping Act took e ﬀect in 1972.  
According to a Los Angeles Times investigative report, shipping 
logs show that around 2,000 barrels of the chemical dichlorodiphen -
yltrichloroethane (DDT) were dumped each month from 1947 to 1961 
into a designated dumpsite in Southern California. DDT, a strong  
pesticide that can lead to cancer and developmental abnormalities in 
humans and animals, is now banned from the market. Unfortunately, 
these chemicals are heavily found in dolphins and sea lions near the 
dumpsite.
/T_he new research, sponsored by the federal agency National Ocean -
ic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), will provide abundant 
support for taking a closer look into the dumpsite. In collaboration 
with UC Santa Barbara and San Diego State University, SIO will focus 
the research targets to fully characterize the extent of the dumpsite, 
identify the toxin “ /f_ingerprint” contained in the sediments, and assess 
toxin pathways to the upper ocean. 
/T_his research will also develop potential remedial strategies, such 
as studying the purifying e ﬀects of microbes, in an attempt to neutral -
ize the toxin on the sea /f_loor.
“It’s deeply concerning that we don’t yet know the full extent of 
the DDT and potentially other toxic materials dumped o ﬀ California’s 
shores and the threat they pose to the environment,” said Senator Di -anne Feinstein, who directed the funding along with Senator Alex Pa -
dilla.
“Until we understand the scope of the problem, we can’t develop so -
lutions to solve it,” Feinstein continued. “ /T_hat’s why we secured fund -
ing to map the region’s sea /f_loor and test the barrels, sediment and water 
column. I’m pleased NOAA and Scripps are moving forward with the 
next phase of this critically needed work and eagerly await their /f_ind-

Function Effectively to Respond to External Stimuli
By Chelsea Blankenchip
/gid00004/gid00016/gid00015/gid00021/gid00019/gid00010/gid00003/gid00022/gid00021/gid00010/gid00015/gid00008/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
Recent work by a team of re -
searchers has shown that human 
brain organoids implanted into 
the cortex of a mouse brain are 
both functionally and physically 
integrated into the mouse host 
brain. /T_hrough the use of trans -
parent graphene microelectrodes 
and two-photon imaging, re -
searchers were able to show that 
the implanted human brain or -
ganoid responds to light stimuli 
as well as that the organoid is vas -
cularized by the mouse tissues.
Organoids are small organ-
like structures derived from stem 
cells. In this study, the organoids 
were generated by taking skin 
cells and reprogramming them to 
induce pluripotency, the ability to 
diﬀerentiate into any cell type in 
the body. /T_hese cells are known 
as induced pluripotent stem cells. 
iPSCs can then be di ﬀerenti -
ated into the desired cell type, in 
this case human brain cells, and 
grown in 3D culture to create or -
ganoids. 
/T_here are many potential uses 
for organoids in science. Organ -
oids can be used to study organ 
development or to study disease 
states that a ﬀect speci /f_ic organs. 
Furthermore, organoids have the 
potential to one day be used to restore organ function for people 
whose organs are damaged or no 
longer functioning. 
Despite this potential, organ -
oids have some limitations. Spe -
ci/f_ically, organoids lack blood 
vessels which allow for the ex -
change of nutrients and waste 
which therefore allow for organ 
growth. Furthermore, organoids 
lack many of the immune cells 
present in our organs. As a result, 
organoids cannot perform the 
full function of the organ they are 
modeling.
/T_he team of researchers led by 
Duygu Kuzum from the UC San 
Diego Department of Electrical 
and Computer Engineering and 
Anna Devor from the Boston 
University Department of Bio -
medical Engineering developed 
an innovative method to study 
how organoids integrate into the 
host upon transplantation.
Researchers removed a small 
portion of the retrospinal cortex 
in a mouse brain and implanted 
a human cortical organoid in its 
place. In addition to the organ -
oid, researchers also implanted a 
transparent microelectrode array 
to monitor the electrical signaling 
of the organoid and surrounding 
host brain tissue. 
/T_he microelectrodes used in 
this study were developed by Dr. 
Kuzum’s lab in 2014. /T_he unique transparency of the graphene mi -
croelectrodes allows for collect -
ing both visual and electrical data 
from a single animal. 
/T_hree weeks post implant, the 
human brain tissue showed signs 
of responding to an external light 
stimulus in a similar fashion to 
the surrounding mouse tissue. 
/T_his data indicates that the im -
planted tissue was receiving in -
put from the surrounding mouse 
tissue enabling it to respond to 
stimuli.
Due to the transparent nature 
of the microelectrode array, re -
searchers were also able to study 
vascularization of the human or -
ganoid using two-photon micros -
copy. /T_his microscopy technique 
allows for imaging thick tissues as 
well as live tissues. /T_he research -
ers found that the human corti -
cal organoid transplant was vas -
cularized. While the amount of 
vascularization was less than that 
seen in the mouse brain tissue, 
the organoid was still connected 
to the host through blood vessels. 
One of the lead authors on the 
paper, Madison Wilson, senior 
electrical and computer engineer -
ing doctorate student at UCSD, 
noted that the most distinguish -
ing factor of the work is their abil -
ity to collect data longitudinally. 
“What’s important about the 
longitudinal study is that we im -planted the array and we sealed 
the craniotomy with a glass win -
dow and from then on we didn’t 
need any additional surgeries,” 
Wilson said. “So we could re -
cord both electrically and opti -
cally and visually inspect the area 
without needing to perturb the 
mouse any more.”
/T_his study is the /f_irst to show 
functional responses of organoid 
transplants to external stimuli 
and also the /f_irst to develop a 
technique to simultaneously 
study functional and morpholog -
ical integration of human organ -
oids into mouse models.
“/T_his is the /f_irst step in prov -
ing that exogenous tissue can be 
implanted in a brain and gain 
similar functions to the sur -
rounding cortex,” she said. 
/T_he researchers hope that this 
work will enable the study of dis -
ease states in living organisms as 
well as advance the /f_ield toward 
using organoids to restore dam -
aged or non functioning brain 
regions. 
Additional local collaborators 
include researchers from Alysson 
Muotri’s lab at UCSD and Fred 
Gage’s lab at the Salk Institute./uni25B6 SCRIPPS INSTITUTE , from page 1
ings as we plan for the next steps.”
SIO’s research on the dump -
site can be traced back to the 
expedition in March 2021, when 
SIO /f_irst mapped over 36,000 
acres of the sea /f_loor in the San 
Pedro Basin. It turned out that 
there were over 27,000 targets 
identi /f_ied as dumped barrels and 
over 100,000 total debris objects 
on the sea /f_loor.
/T_he expedition result was un -
expected, according to Eric Ter -
rill, chief scientist of the expedi -tion and director of the Marine 
Physical Laboratory at SIO.
“/T_here are several distinct 
track-line patterns in the sur -
veyed area, suggesting that the 
dumping was repeatedly done 
from an underway platform such 
as a moving ship or barge,” Ter -
rill said.  “Some of those lines are 
as long as 11 miles and approach 
state waters. While our mapping 
sonars cannot measure the con -
tents inside the barrels, the target 
locations are consistent with the previously identi /f_ied dumpsite 
and extend much further than we 
expected.”
/T_he broader sea area known as 
the Southern California Border -
land, is also valuable for study -
ing the deep-sea system, which 
has been rarely explored before. 
Uncommon earth minerals, in -
cluding ferromanganese and 
phosphorite which have uses in  
electronic manufacturing, have 
been found in this area, indicat -
ing its potential for deep-sea min -ing.
“/T_he DDT dump site provides 
evidence of a large human foot -
print in the deep ocean, but we 
are just starting to identify the 
eﬀects on local marine commu -
nities,” said chief scientist Lisa 
Levin, a professor of biological 
oceanography at SIO.
/T_he latest research updates 
and more information can be 
found on the SIO website.

Stopping the Epidemic of  Fake Professionals in Media
By Raymond Tran
/gid00014/gid00002/gid00015/gid00002/gid00008/gid00010/gid00015/gid00008/gid00001/gid00006/gid00005/gid00010/gid00021/gid00016/gid00019
Let’s face it. We are all 
suckers for really bad reality TV 
shows. /T_here is a reason that the 
Kardashians have conquered the 
screens for as long as they have. 
Even if some shows annoy us, a 
majority of these reality shows are 
relatively harmless; it’s just people 
living their lives and making 
questionable decisions that are 
sensationalized for the sake of 
entertainment. However, there 
comes a point where it no longer 
is harmless: when these reality 
shows start to negatively a ﬀect 
their audiences and the “guests” of 
these shows. 
Shows revolving around 
professionals such as “Shark Tank” 
and “Cake Boss” have been around 
since the 2000s. /T_hese types of 
reality TV shows in particular 
have a large viewership because 
they give audiences a glimpse of 
what happens behind the scenes 
and are led by professionals in 
their respective /f_ields. But what 
happens when these so-called 
“professionals” start to prioritize 
the entertainment side of reality 
TV more than doing their actual 
jobs? 
Particularly “Judge Judy, ” “Dr. 
Phil, ” and “ /T_he Dr. Oz Show” have 
been criticized for their lack of 
professionalism, with some even 
questioning their quali /f_ications 
for being in their positions or 
holding their titles. It is time that 
we stopped giving these people 
the platform and the attention 
that allows them to spread misinformation and negatively 
aﬀect the lives of the “guests” or 
audiences of their shows. 
Contrary to the name of her 
show, Judy Sheindlin is not an 
active judge. While she was a 
judge prior to the show, Sheindlin 
retired from being an o ﬃcial judge 
before the show even aired. In the 
cases that she oversees in the show, 
Sheindlin acts as an arbiter rather 
than an actual judge. However, 
these cases are still real and do 
have real-life consequences. Judge 
Judy is constantly seen being 
unprofessional in court, including 
interrupting and dismissing those 
in her courtroom. Although being 
rude and cold was always a part of 
her allure, there are instances in 
which she was accused of being 
racist and classist, qualities that no 
judge should have in or out of the 
courtroom. 
Additionally, one of the show’s 
executive producer and director 
Randy Douthit “has repeatedly 
been accused of sexually harassing 
employees, making inappropriate 
sexual comments to female 
staﬀers, o ﬀering preferential 
treatment to sta ﬀers he found 
attractive, and ordering junior 
producers to bring fewer Black 
litigants on the show, ” according 
to Business Insider. In the same 
article, it was also said that 
Sheindlin praised her executive 
producers and directors for the 
show since they “continuously 
make [her] look good. ” 
“[Sheindlin] does not care how 
the show gets made. She just wants 
the money in her pocket, and she 
doesn’t care how the producers 
are treated, ” an unspeci /f_ied former producer told Business Insider.
Although “Judge Judy” ended 
in 2021, Sheindlin has a new show 
on Amazon Prime “Judy Justice. ” 
With the lack of a response 
regarding the sexual harassment 
claims of her executive producer 
and her racist and classist 
instances, both her quali /f_ications 
and reasons for doing a reality 
legal show should come into 
question. 
But “Judge Judy” is not the only 
professional on TV that should 
be stopped. Dr. Phil McGraw has 
been an onscreen psychologist for 
over 20 years and has progressively 
gotten worse at his job. 
In 2016, Danielle Bregoli, 
better known as “Bhad Bhabie, ” 
made an appearance on “Dr. 
Phil” for her violent and erratic 
behavior towards her mother. 
While the episode went viral on 
social media. Bregoli was sent to 
a behavioral correctional facility 
for teens Turn-About Ranch, one 
of many behavioral correctional 
facilities that not only abuse 
teenagers but also force them into 
submission. 
Hannah Archuleta, a guest 
who appeared on “Dr. Phil” in 
2019, was also sent to Turn-About 
Ranch by McGraw’s referral, 
where she claimed to be sexually 
assaulted by one of the sta ﬀ 
members. A /f_ter reporting the 
assault, Archuleta was allegedly 
punished. 
In 2021, Bregoli spoke out 
again about the facility as well 
as Dr. Phil for supporting and 
suggesting that she be sent to an 
abusive correctional camp and 
demanded an apology from him. Why was Dr. Phil allowed 
to send people to camps that 
committed such horri /f_ic and 
atrocious acts? Why is he still 
given a platform despite not 
having a valid license? Why does 
anyone still trust any advice that 
he gives the guests on the show? 
His psychologist license 
expired in 2006, and he actually 
chose to not renew it. He was 
also never licensed to practice 
in California, where his show 
is /f_ilmed. Dr. Phil has no actual 
motivation to help others or o ﬀer 
therapeutic advice, rather he 
wants his patients to have these 
wild outbursts for the sake of 
entertainment value. 
It is time that we stop 
capitalizing on the documentation 
of others’ pain. It’s cheap, and it’s 
shameful. 
Why are these private 
moments aired out for the sake of 
entertainment? I understand that 
in some capacity, people may have 
been helped by these shows, but so 
have millions of other people who 
have sought professional help in a 
private setting. 
In the /f_irst month of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. 
Mehmet Oz openly supported 
and suggested the malaria 
drugs hydroxychloroquine 
and chloroquine for treating 
COVID-19, when in reality, a 
study done by the Veteran A ﬀairs 
found that COVID-19 patients 
that were treated with the drugs 
were more likely to die than 
untreated patients. Once the 
research came up, the support for 
the drugs stopped, but why was 
Dr. Oz even suggesting the drugs 
without any substantial scienti /f_ic 
research to support his stance? 
/T_his is not the only 
misinformation that “ /T_he Dr. 
Oz Show” has been spreading. 
According to the New Y ork Times, 
two of the show’s researchers 
claim to have little power to push 
back against the show’s topics and 
“they regularly questioned the 
show’s ethics to one another and 
discussed quitting in protest. ”
With Oz running an ultimately 
losing Senatorial campaign in the 
last midterm election, it is a better 
time than ever to call into question 
not only his quali /f_ications for 
being a doctor, but also for being 
a politician and a leader. 
/T_hese types of interactions and 
topics get views, and that’s exactly 
why they continue to get airtime 
and a platform. Monetarily, it 
makes sense for the studios to 
continue to churn out season a /f_ter 
season of these fake professionals 
oﬀering — very questionable — 
advice, guidance, or even making 
decisions for people. /T_he better 
question is probably, why are 
we as an audience still giving 
these individuals the viewership 
that allows them to keep being 
renewed by their studios? 
We can watch fake people get 
screwed over by fake professionals 
on /f_ictional TV . It’s time to 
draw the line on watching real 
people getting screwed over 
by fake professionals on reality 
TV . Whether or not you’re 
watching them “ironically” or for 
entertainment purposes, by giving 
them viewership, we give them 
the power to a ﬀect real people for 
monetary reasons.

Only While the Alliance Lives

Clashes like the one started 
and exacerbated by Y e West 
and his dangerously antisemitic 
dictums as of late continue to 
threaten the racialized Jewish 
community. Rather than seeking 
unity between marginalized 
groups, West plays an explosive 
blame game.
While being extremely harmful 
to Black social justice movements 
against systematic oppression and 
racial strati /f_ication in the 20th 
century, antisemitism has since 
pervaded the rhetoric of those 
like West, who are themselves 
to blame for their recent failures 
rather than the Jewish people. 
West’s downfall stems from, 
among many statements, his 
idolization of Hilter. /T_his hatred 
and division has continued to 
hold back advancement in many 
communities including the Black 
community.
In 2002, the U.S. witnessed 
exactly how antisemitism held 
back marginalized communities. 
/T_hat year, Newark mayoral 
candidate Cory Booker lost among 
Black voters despite his activities 
towards their advancement in part 
due to antisemitic attacks against 
him. Cory Booker launched a 
campaign against incumbent 
Sharpe James for the mayoral 
position of Newark. Booker was 
then a fresh face, with extremely 
progressive ideas for the time. 
With a personality that exuded 
erudite charisma, Booker was 
quickly able to gain the support 
of minority Black areas within 
Newark. But in the majority 
Black areas, he faced many litmus 
tests, primarily about his racial 
background, monetary status, and 
his religion. 
From the outset of campaign 
season, James continuously 
portrayed Booker as a rich and out-
of-touch carpetbagger because 
of his privileged upbringing. But 
when these attacks failed to stall 
Booker’s success among Black civilians, he resorted to antisemitic 
threats. By labeling Booker as ‘a 
Jew, ’ James was able to draw on 
decades of generational tensions 
between the two ethnic groups. 
/T_hese con /f_licts started on the 
topic of Zionism in the 1960s 
in parallel to united minority 
Americans racing to achieve racial 
justice. But somewhere along 
the way, racialization started to 
precede justice. Outside politics 
pervaded the realm of civil rights 
and racial reforms. Among these 
issues was the Arab-Israeli con /f_lict. 
/T_hough initially, anti-Israeli 
sentiment was seen as a political 
stance, the rhetoric surrounding 
Black opinions on Israel became 
more antisemitic in nature. 
Starting in the summer of 1967, a 
youth-centered civil rights group 
called the Student Nonviolent 
Coordinating Committee (SNCC) 
started facing serious backlash 
from the Jewish community. /T_his 
outrage intensi /f_ied considerably 
as SNCC’s anti-Israeli government 
rhetoric had slowly dissolved into general stereotyping of Jewish 
Americans.
When Booker exposed James’ 
million-dollar income and 
corruption, James responded 
with rhetoric that implied that 
their constituents could not and 
should not trust Cory Booker 
because he was supposedly 
Jewish; though in reality, Booker 
was Baptist just like James. While 
this was a clever political strategy 
that showcased James’ nuanced 
understanding of strained Jewish 
and Black relations, it diverted 
the people’s attention from James’ 
own incapability to improve their 
communities and the city of 
Newark. /T_he predominantly Black 
city fell for antisemitic tropes that 
led to Booker losing the 2002 
election though he won a rematch 
four years later.
/T_hroughout the years, the 
refusal of Black America to work 
with Jewish America has led to 
many missed opportunities to 
advance the causes of both of 
these communities within the U.S.. While a Human Rights 
Watch exposé contains undeniable 
evidence of Israeli imperialism, 
calling it an “apartheid, ” it is a 
complete non-starter to expand 
these criticisms beyond those 
of the governments’ treatment 
of the Palestinian people and 
minority Jewish communities. If 
a Jewish person is a conservative, 
colonial, racist and imperialist 
Zionist, that view should be open 
to rebuttal and critique. But that 
position does not make acceptable 
any assault on them based on 
their faith. It does not merit any 
questioning of his character based 
on racialized stereotypes. 
As an Asian-American, I see 
my own community weaponizing 
an axis of division and anti-
Blackness to rail against a ﬃrmative 
action but these divisive thoughts 
hurt us all. From civil rights to 
liberation to reparations, the only 
way to achieve all of our goals 
is to /f_ight the oppressor before 
assassinating the character of the 
fellow oppressed.

HECTOR ARRIETA
In September of 2022, Jean-
Luc Godard passed away. He was 
a fantastic director, a creative 
visionary, and a fanatic who de -
voted his entire life to /f_ilm. In his 
early twenties, he was writing im -
passioned essays in “Cahiers du 
Cinema,” a French /f_ilm magazine 
that would become the most in -
/f_luential of the twentieth century. 
His debut /f_ilm “À bout de sou ﬄe” 
(Breathless) in 1960 stunned the 
world and forever changed cin -
ema — Roger Ebert said of it, “No 
debut /f_ilm since ‘Citizen Kane’” 
has been as in /f_luential. For Go -
dard, the cinema was life. He di -
rected over 40 /f_ilms during his 
lifetime, with his /f_inal /f_ilm “Le 
Livre d’image” ( /T_he Image Book) 
being released in 2018 when he 
was 88 years old. 
I was introduced to Godard 
by chance. During high school, 
my French teacher recommended 
one of the /f_irst French New Wave 
/f_ilms, “Les 400 Coups” ( /T_he 400 
Blows) by Tru ﬀaut. I believed the 
/f_ilm was fantastic and started re -
searching the French New Wave. 
I stumbled upon “Pierrot le Fou” 
while on this search; the beautiful 
pastel stills drew me in immedi -
ately. Fittingly, I watched “Pier -
rot” on a /f_irst date, enamored by 
every frame. I was interested in 
/f_ilm, but I had not yet delved into 
the vast library of cinema, and 
“Pierrot le Fou” was unlike any -
thing I had seen before. /T_hough I 
have watched many of Godard’s 
/f_ilms, “Pierrot le Fou” remains my 
favorite and what I consider to be 
his peak of romanticism. /T_he /f_ilm begins with Fer -
dinand (Jean-Paul Belmondo) 
reading a passage about Span -
ish painter Diego Velázquez to 
his daughter. Before we are even 
introduced to who this man is, 
Godard has begun including 
passages recognizing the artis -
tic achievements of those he ad -
mires. Every time I watch a /f_ilm 
by Godard, I feel as though I have 
not yet received the education 
that is necessary to fully under -
stand what Godard admires; I 
come away with an impassioned 
desire to learn about these art -
ists. A /f_ter /f_inishing the passage, 
his wife complains that he has al -
lowed their housekeeper to go to 
the cinema three times this week, 
to which he retorts, “Of course 
I did, they’re showing Johnny 
Guitar. Good for her education.” 
“Johnny Guitar,” a 1954 /f_ilm by 
Nicholas Ray, was a favorite of 
Godard’s and the “Cahiers du 
Cinema” group of /f_ilmmakers. 
Godard’s absolute admiration of 
the cinema, and his vision of its 
ideal form, shine through in only 
the /f_irst few minutes of the /f_ilm.
Ferdinand must accompany 
his wife to a party, which he has 
no desire to do. /T_he scene is cov -
ered by di ﬀering colors while he 
hears drab and empty conversa -
tions. “My hair stayed light and 
so/f_t all day thanks to Elnett Satin 
Spray” a woman /f_lirts, while Fer -
dinand mopes about. Fed up by 
the dreary consumerism of the 
bourgeoisie, he returns home to 
/f_ind the babysitter, his ex-lover 
and the supposed niece of his 
friend Frank, Marriane (Anna 
Karina) asleep. He o ﬀers to drive 
her home.“Pierrot Le Fou” and the Cinema of  Godard

/T_hey had been in love /f_ive and 
a half years ago; Marriane calls 
Ferdinand “Pierrot” (as I will for 
the remainder of this article) and 
he admonishes her. She discusses 
how in photos you know noth -
ing about the individual photo -
graphed: was he a good man? Did 
he have a wife? A Mistress? Pier -
rot responds, “c’est la vie.” In an 
attempt to escape his uneventful 
life, he decides to run away with 
Marriane. /T_his lighthearted, 
seemingly disjointed, and impul -
sive conversation invokes a desire 
to follow the characters on screen, 
to buck any responsibilities and 
run o ﬀ.  
Soon a /f_ter, the /f_ilm cuts to 
Pierrot and Marriane in a di ﬀer-
ent apartment; a sparsely deco -
rated place with guns and am -
munition lining the walls. Rather 
than addressing this, Marriane 
launches into song and the pair 
argue whether or not they have 
agreed to love each other for -
ever. Godard then begins a man -
ner of storytelling he will repeat 
throughout the /f_ilm: he cuts to 
still shots of paintings and scat -
tered stills of the apartment while 
Pierrot and Marriane talk over the 
images. Marriane explains that 
she and her brother Fred knew 
people involved in the Algerian 
war, and the scene cuts to Pierrot 
walking past a dead man lying on 
the /f_loor of the apartment. Frank 
returns to the apartment and the 
pair scheme to knock him out 
and then escape. /T_he pair elope 
and must /f_ill their Peugeot with 
gas. /T_hough they have no money, 
they outwit and subsequently 
beat up the gas station attendants 
through comedic ploys. While driving, Godard again 
/f_lashes paintings and comics 
across the screen, while Marriane 
exclaims, “It was a love story!” 
Cutting back to the car, Pierrot 
looks into the rear-view mirror, 
and exclaims he sees “the face of 
a man about to drive over a cli ﬀ,” 
to which Marriane replies, a /f_ter 
turning the mirror, “I see the face 
of the woman in love with a man 
about to drive over a cli ﬀ.” Pier -
rot turns and responds, “then 
let’s kiss.” I must include this en -
tire section of dialogue because I 
believe it perfectly illustrates the 
love “Pierrot le Fou” displays. /T_he 
/f_ilm is the perfect love story; it 
shows love as one wishes it was. 
An overjoyed, youthful, and lim -
itless adoration of another. A /f_ter 
viewing this /f_ilm, when one falls 
in love they see themselves as 
Pierrot, endlessly dazzled by an -
other. A love that leads to crazy 
and irrational moments. 
Pierrot and Marriane stop at 
a bar and order drinks, wonder -
ing how to pay for them. /T_hey tell 
stories to the patrons in hopes of 
a tip, Pierrot describing summer 
and how lovers long for the warm 
evening air. /T_hey feign a car ac -
cident to escape the grasp of the 
police and Marriane’s involve -
ment, setting the car ablaze with 
a ri/f_le. As they begin to walk, all 
Pierrot says is that travel broad -
ens the mind. 
/T_he couple saunter through 
the countryside, crossing rivers, 
marching through /f_ields and for -
ests, and picking /f_lowers. /T_hey 
steal a car and change clothes, 
Pierrot turns to the camera and 
exclaims all Marriane thinks 
about is fun. Pierrot drives the car straight into the sea, another 
absurd, passion-fuelled act. Mar -
riane doesn’t complain; they walk 
until dusk and fall asleep on the 
shore. /T_hey make love and wake 
up covered by the sand. 
Pierrot becomes obsessed with 
poetry, the pair laze around the 
shore while squatting in a small 
hut; “perfect happiness!” Pierot 
exclaims. However, the pair’s dif -
ferences start eating away at their 
happiness, “you speak to me in 
words, and I look at you with feel -
ings” Marriane complains. Pier -
rot speaks directly to the camera, 
expressing for Godard that this 
/f_ilm is not about people’s lives, but 
only life itself. 
/T_he pair begin to reconcile 
and continue to prance through 
the countryside. “She makes 
me think of music,” Pierrot ex -
claims, “It’s a /f_ine day my love, in 
dreams, in words, and in death.” 
/T_hroughout these sequences, Go -
dard paints the lovers with beau -
tiful and welcoming pastels. Go -
dard evokes a feeling similar to 
Shakespeare’s 138th Sonnet. One 
of youthful bliss, ignorant of the 
world, and utterly /f_lattered by one 
another.
Finally, for one can only dream 
that bliss would last forever, the 
people Marriane was involved 
with — gun-runners of a sort — 
catch the pair and they are sepa -
rated. Marriane is taken; Pierrot 
rushes to /f_ind her and discovers 
she has killed her captor but has 
disappeared. Other mobsters /f_ind 
him and torture him into confess -
ing her potential whereabouts be -
fore freeing him. Dejected, Pier -
rot wanders onto train tracks and BY MATTHEW RISLEY

Preceding many UC San Diego 
lectures or events — o /f_ten from the 
humanities departments — profes -
sors or TAs note that UCSD stu -
dents, members, and faculty reside 
on unceded Kumeyaay land. /T_he 
lines adhere to a land acknowl -
edgement statement and end with 
the UCSD community acknowl -
edging and being grateful for the 
Kumeyaay people’s stewardship 
and contributions. In total, San 
Diego has the highest number of 
federally recognized reservations 
for any county in the U.S.: 18.
During Native American 
Heritage Month, which began in 
November, Chancellor Khosla 
noted in a campus-wide email that 
UCSD kicks o ﬀ every month with 
a celebration of Native American 
culture and dance — one that’s 
been taking place annually for 16 
years. /T_he month-long celebra -
tions include performances, food, 
and /f_ilms. In fact, Miss Kumeyaay 
Nation, Priscilla Ortiz-LaChappa, 
was a keynote speaker for the event 
due to her active participation in 
helping preserve language and tra -
ditions.
But the history of UC expan -
sion of public schooling is perhaps 
not as polished and much richer 
than the statement on unceded 
land. /T_he concept is intertwined 
with the lives of Native Americans. 
Moreover, if much emphasis is on 
spotlighting Native Americans for November solely, their identi -
ties are again potentially cast 
away to a designated time rather 
than acknowledged for their rich 
presence before any UC schools 
came along.
/T_hrough the Morrill Act, 
nearly 11 million acres of land 
from about 250 tribes and na -
tions were expropriated from 
tribal lands for UC higher edu -
cation. /T_his means that UCSD is 
not the only UC school on tribal 
land; others include UC Davis 
on the Patwin people’s lands.
Despite this expropriation, 
this act was the start of those of 
modest means to access higher 
education and was the /f_irst ma -
jor federal funding for higher 
education.
UC Berkeley dubs what hap -
pened in the early 19th century 
with Native American land as a 
“UC land grab.” 
/T_he rami /f_ications are still 
present. To put things into per -
spective, the Kumeyaay people 
have been present in San Diego 
and Mexico for thousands of 
years. /T_heir interactions with 
UCSD have not evidently been 
sparse and clean-cut though, as 
detailed by recent disputes of 
who gets to obtain artifacts and 
remains on the land through the 
Native American Graves Protec -
tion and Repatriation Act. /T_he 
act entails that tribes can obtain 
excavated human remains and 
cultural items from their land.
As also stated by the 2020 fall 
report titled “ /T_he University of California Land Grab: A Legacy 
of Pro /f_it from Indigenous Land” 
from the Joseph A. Myers Center 
for Research on Native American 
Issues, California Indians re -
ceived the short end of the stick 
through the Morrill Act enacted 
for postsecondary education. /T_his 
coupled with the present under -
representation of Native Ameri -
cans in higher education means 
that Native American individu -
als’ presence can be suppressed 
once more. 
A/f_ter all, according to UCSD’s 
2021-2022 student body demo -
graphics, American Indian/Alas -
ka Native students made up just 
0.4% of the undergraduate body. 
/T_he report states that the 
earnings from land sales of the 
Morrill Act invested into stocks 
would mean a permanent endow -
ment for each university while 
on the opposite side, many tribes 
didn’t receive any compensation. 
Also, the Native American tribes 
in California didn’t get compen -
sated for the land sold to fund the 
UC’s endowment.
Moreover, the source explores 
the familiar settler-colonialism 
concept or the erasure of Indig -
enous people for land to be taken 
by settlers. /T_his concept of own -
ership collides with many Native 
Americans’ beliefs of having a 
caretaker relationship with the 
land above owning it. /T_he re -
port comments on how the U.S., 
among other countries, utilized 
genocidal violence in the 19th 
century as well as seizure of land and ironically impacted the na -
tive inhabitants from obtaining a 
more education-oriented agenda.
UCSD pledges not to leave 
any Native American student on 
the sidelines and promises e ﬀorts 
will be made to incorporate them 
in the educational sphere.
On the second /f_loor of Price 
Center West, the currently ex -
panding Intertribal Resource 
Center is present. Its priority is 
to help American Indian/Alaskan 
Native/ indigenous students and 
allow tribal communities to gain 
more education. 
/T_he Native American Oppor -
tunity plan for Native American 
undergrad and graduate students 
is one of the plans the center sup -
ports and further, its waiving 
process began this fall. /T_his plan 
means that for incoming Califor -
nia students who are additionally 
a part of a “federally recognized 
Native American, American In -
dian, and Alaska Native tribes,” 
in-state systemwide tuition and 
Student Services Fees are covered 
without a separate application 
process.
/T_his ties into the possible rep -
arations UC schools have made; 
others include providing schol -
arships to Native students to do 
research on UC lands and further 
acknowledgement of the NAG -
PRA.
/T_he land acknowledgements 
UC schools incorporate to recog -
nize the Native American com -
munities of the school are one of 
the /f_irst ways students may hear Residing on Kumeyaay Land at UC San Diego and the

before UC universities emerged. 
Still, the statements can seem 
more like vague platitudes than 
informative lessons to learn from. 
Such words can easily hold little 
meaning without an e ﬀort  to un -
derstand the Kumeyaay people’s 
or other Native American peo -
ple’s identities. 
In late May, UCSD will hold 
its free, annual Powwow perfor -
mance, an event of dance such as

While it may not be a New Y ear 
for everyone just yet, New Y ear’s 
Day as a concept is revered and 
held to one of the highest esteems 
in most cultures. It’s a marker of 
time and growth. Last year is of -
/f_icially in the past, and whatever 
baggage that came with it can be 
thrown away with the weekly gar -
bage. And throwing out the trash 
comes with space to bring in the 
new. Enter, New Y ear’s Resolu -
tions. Did you create a work out 
plan? Maybe you chose to clean 
for 15 minutes everyday to stay 
ahead of the midterm messes. 
One of my resolutions was to 
write something creative every -
day, and I can say con /f_idently up 
to the point of writing this article, 
that I have consistently written 
at least 20 minutes each day (is it 
only Jan. 7? maybe).
No matter what you chose — 
if you chose anything — there is 
an air around New Y ear’s Resolu -
tions. /T_he fact is, most resolutions 
are never completed, but I want to 
look deeper than that. Why are we 
so con /f_ident in ourselves on Jan. 
1 but indi ﬀerent on the 31? I can’t 
remember if it was a teacher or 
counselor who had told me this, 
but it sticks with me for any goals 
that I make, and especially resolu -
tions. /T_he best way to stick with a 
goal is to A: be very realistic with 
yourself, B: be speci /f_ic in your 
goal, and C: understand there will 
be days that you don’t satisfy your 
goal, but that doesn’t mean you 
should quit. Changing these little 
but important caveats could be 
the di ﬀerence between complet -
ing a goal or forgetting completely 
about it.
Being realistic with yourself is 
imperative. If you were sedentary 
all of 2022, don’t expect yourself to 
immediately be able to do a HITT 
workout every day. However, you 
could set up a schedule with a 
trainer on campus at RIMAC to 
create a plan best suited for your 
/f_itness goals! For example, I want 
to save money each month for 
holiday and birthday gi /f_ts, so I 
don’t feel like I am scrambling and 
having to choose between buying 
gi/f_ts or groceries; however, I know 
in the past I have ended up dip -ping into it on weeks that I may 
have had a lighter paycheck. To 
be realistic with myself, I set the 
goal that I will save the money on 
store-speci /f_ic gi/f_t cards and have 
them saved together. Will this 
work? I have 11 months to /f_ind 
out! However, even if it doesn’t, 
I know I was more realistic with 
myself, and thus, I didn’t set my -
self up for failure.
I cannot stress enough that 
having speci /f_ic goals is one of the 
most important parts of keeping 
them. To me, being speci /f_ic is like 
putting responsibility on yourself. 
It sets the intention and the task 
plan. When you are too broad, it 
can almost be like absolving your -
self of the responsibility of /f_in-
ishing. If you don’t know the end 
goal, how can you be at fault for 
not completing it? Going back to 
/f_itness and general health, as it is 
one of the most common resolu -
tions, saying that you want to get in shape versus you want to be 
able to deadli /f_t your current body 
weight are two separate things. 
When you are more abstract with 
yourself, it is harder to continue 
because there are too many op -
tions with how it can go. I have 
some friends who say this works 
for them, so if you’ve noticed re -
sults by being more broad, more 
power to you! I am terrible at 
“broad goals” so no matter how 
small, I still give myself a very spe -
ci/f_ic outcome to strive for. 
Take my reading goal, for ex -
ample: I have steadily increased 
the number since 2021, the /f_irst 
year I set a goal. From 24 books, to 
36, and now, in 2023 to 50, I set a 
goal that I know I can achieve but 
also still challenges me. I tend to 
read on average about eight more 
books than my reading goal, so 
I’m excited to see if I can push the 
barrier! All of this to say, if I said 
“I want to read more this year, ” I don’t believe I would be as moti -
vated because I don’t know what 
that inherently means — how 
much more do I want to read? 
What do I want to read? And if 
there are too many options, I’m 
more likely to just let it blow over 
my head. So, if you /f_ind yourself 
in this predicament, it might be 
because you’re not being speci /f_ic 
with yourself.
Finally, forgive yourself when 
you don’t follow your plan com -
pletely! Y ou may have wanted to 
work out four days a week but 
only got to go toto the gym twice 
one week. /T_hat doesn’t mean you 
have failed and that you should 
give up; it just means that when 
the new week starts, you can re -
set and continue making progress 
towards your original goal. I have 
a goal to stretch for 15 minutes in 
the morning to wake myself up, 
but I know inherently there will be 
days that I wake up late and don’t have the time. “Failing” at a goal 
isn’t the lack of completing it, but 
the refusal to do it again. 365 days 
is a huge commitment — don’t let 
one day ruin the other 364.
I have told you some of my res -
olutions, but I’m interested to hear 
yours. A /f_ter reading this post, did 
you go back and tweak some of 
yours? Do you set intentions for 
the new year? Everyone celebrates 
the holiday a little di ﬀerently, but 
in the end, I think we can all pat 
ourselves on the back when our 
date rolls around for another year 
under our belt. Take a deep breath, 
have some water (I know that was 
on your list, don’t lie to me), and 
welcome in the New Y ear and new 
quarter with a smile.
Or don’t — if you’re channel -

Different New Year’s Traditions Around the World
By KELLY LOO
/gid00004/gid00016/gid00015/gid00021/gid00019/gid00010/gid00003/gid00022/gid00021/gid00010/gid00015/gid00008/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
It’s time for a new year, but 
some traditions stay old. Coun -
tries worldwide have been cel -
ebrating the occasion in their own 
unique ways, signifying di ﬀerent 
superstitions that they believe in. 
Despite one’s religion, race, gen -
der, or country of residence, ev -
eryone celebrates new years with 
their loved ones. However, some 
countries have unique traditions 
to welcome a new year.
Philippines:  One would as -
sociate New Y ear’s Eve with /f_ire-
works, and rightfully so. New 
Y ear’s Eve is not a quiet event for 
many, and Filipinos are no excep -
tion. In addition to the /f_ireworks, 
people will bang pots and pans, 
and children will play homemade 
instruments. While /f_ireworks are 
to scare away evil spirits, they 
are also to display the bright -
ness of the new year. During this 
occasion, you can see Filipinos 
wearing polka dots, emphasiz -
ing the rounded shape. In many 
Asian cultures, round things are 
a symbol of luck, and everyone 
is manifesting it. /T_hey also have 
a superstition with the number 
12, representing the time as well 
as the number of months in the 
year. /T_hey do this by displaying 12 
of one item in the house, usually 
round fruit.
Denmark:  For those who are 
not big fans of loud sounds, this 
one might not be for you. To wel -
come the new year, Danish people 
would smash unused plates and 
glasses against the doors of fam -
ily and friends. While it might be 
a mess to clean up, it is thought 
to ward o ﬀ evil spirits. Another 
tradition is jumping o ﬀ a chair 
together to bring about good luck.
Spain:  /T_hey eat 12 grapes, 
one to represent each stroke of the clock, as well as good fortune 
for each month of the year. Y ou 
eat one grape each time the clock 
strikes at 12, and if you can /f_inish 
all the grapes in time, the tradition 
says that your wishes will come 
true! /T_hey also wear intentionally 
colored underwear, with a di ﬀer-
ent color representing a di ﬀerent 
wish for the year. Fun fact: for 
the hopeless romantics out there, 
wearing red underwear will bring 
about luck in love. Cava, a Spanish 
sparkling wine, is a popular drink 
that is consumed by many on this 
occasion. Y ou can see people put 
a golden object at the bottom of 
the glass, signifying good luck and 
wealth for the year ahead.
Italy:  Not too far away in Italy, 
they also have a tradition of wear -
ing colored underwear. However, 
they speci /f_ically wear the bold 
color of red. /T_his dates back to 
Roman times, where Roman war -riors wore red tunics to represent 
strength and intimidate their ene -
mies. /T_his is one way they scare o ﬀ 
evil spirits; loud /f_ireworks are the 
other. Stemming from the ancient 
belief that these spirits do not like 
loud noises, /f_ireworks and /f_ire-
crackers are a large part of their 
New Y ear’s Eve celebrations, last -
ing for a few hours in some cities. 
Being one of the most well-known 
culinary countries in the world, 
it is no doubt that Italians have 
staples in the welcoming of the 
new year. Such dishes include len -
tils and, just like in Spain, grapes! 
Lentils grow in size when cooked, 
which signi /f_ies increasing wealth, 
and grapes signify well-being.
Greece:  /T_he new year for 
Greece is the same day as Saint 
Basil’s day. /T_herefore, some tradi -
tions may overlap between these 
two occasions. /T_he /f_irst is the cut -
ting of the new year’s cake, also known as vasilopita. It is a cake 
baked with a coin inside, and it 
is said that whoever received the 
slice of cake with the coin will be 
the lucky one that year. In addi -
tion, they hang pomegranates and 
onions at their door, the former 
at night representing fortune and 
luck, and the latter at day repre -
senting growth and rebirth. /T_he 
onion is usually brought back 
from church service earlier that 
day.
Brazil:  Ever wonder why you 
always see white out /f_its in Brazil’s 
new year’s celebrations? It’s be -
cause it is the top must-do during 
this occasion. /T_his stems from the 
Candomblé religion, where they 
would wear white during rituals 
to seek peace and spiritual puri -
/f_ication. New year, new life, a /f_ter 
all. If you were wondering if the 
all-white dress code applies to the 
undergarments as well, the answer is… somewhat. Similar to the Eu -
ropean nations, the di ﬀerent col -
ors represent di ﬀerent wishes, so 
wearing white would mean one 
is wishing for peace and harmony 
for the upcoming year. Other col -
ors include yellow for wealth and 
blue for serenity and friendship.
With multiple countries over -
lapping in the tradition of having 
diﬀerent colored underwear, it 
may be worth recollecting on the 
colors that you wore to see what 
wishes you’ve brought on! If you 
had multiple colors, you have 
drawn on more wishes. However 
you celebrate new years, I hope 
everyone had a great time be -
ing surrounded by loved ones, 
whether that’s family or friends. 
Manifest great things and let’s try 
our best to stick to our new year’s 
resolutions.

the a /f_ternoon” he laments, only 
to dash out of the way a second 
before the train barrels through.
/T_hough I earlier claimed that 
this /f_ilm was the perfect love sto -
ry due to its seemingly unlimited 
joy delivered through the pro -
tagonists, I must correct myself. 
At this point Godard transitions 
to detailing the mistress of love, 
that terrible feeling of heartbreak. 
One is not complete without the 
other, the vibrant contrast be -
tween the two is what gives each 
such power. 
Pierrot searches for Marriane 
in vain, /f_inally settling down on 
the coast. She suddenly appears 
and convinces him to accom -
pany her on a mission to help her 
brother Fred. Pierrot agrees, des -
perately scrambling to rekindle 
the relationship with Marriane. 
Along with Marriane and Fred’s 
accomplices, he double-crosses 
a deal and delivers the money to 
Marriane. We /f_ind that Fred is 
not Marriane’s brother, but an -
other lover. Pierrot, unknowing 
of Marriane’s plan, romantically 
claims he will count to 137, and 
that by the time he /f_inishes she 
will be back and they will elope 
for the last time. 
Pierrot reaches 89; Marriane 
and Fred are shown embracing 
while Pierrot counts ever higher. 
He realizes something is wrong, 
rushes a /f_ter her, and arrives sec -
onds too late; she has embarked 
on a boat, the promises of a love 
lasting forever sailing with her. 
He hops aboard another boat to 
chase a /f_ter Marriane and Fred, 
disembarking on an island before seeing them running together. He 
chases and in a rash shootout hits 
both Fred and Marriane. 
She lies dying and asks Pier -
rot to forgive her. “My name’s 
Ferdinand. It’s too late” is all he 
mutters. He /f_inds dynamite in the 
garage of the hideout, alongside 
a bucket of blue paint. Without 
any thought, he paints his face 
blue. Screaming, he runs outside 
and ties the dynamite around his 
head. He lights the fuse and, too 
late, realizes his idea of a glorious, 
romantic death is idiotic.
A massive explosion paints the 
skyline, the camera pans to the 
sea. /T_he two lovers have recon -
nected. Eternity is theirs again. 
Godard has described the in -
describable feeling of love. Like 
all of his /f_ilms, it is not about 
the characters, it is about life it -
self. All that one has felt is con -
veyed through these peoples’ 
lives. /T_his /f_ilm ba ﬄes the youth 
who has not yet experienced all 
that is on screen, but it makes 
the most wonderful sense to the 
lovestruck; the most terrible sense 
to the heartbroken. I cannot hope 
I have done this /f_ilm justice in my 
depiction; I can only hope that I 
have done well enough to encour -
age others to experience it.  
/T_hough Godard is by no 
means unappreciated by those 
interested in /f_ilm, his praise is 
o/f_ten limited to his work during 
the French New Wave. “Pier -
rot le Fou” comes from this time 
period, yet he continued to cre -
ate boundary-breaking /f_ilms for 
decades a /f_terward. For Godard, 
the emergence of digital cameras 
simply expanded the possibilities 
of cinema, he pushed each as far as he could. In 2014, at the age 
of 84, his /f_ilm “Goodbye to Lan -
guage” delved into the possibili -
ties of using 3D to portray images 
unimaginable on a /f_lat screen. 
His intention with this was, as 
it always was, not to entertain; it 
was to prod the medium further, 
to provoke each member of the 
audience to examine their rela -
tionship with it and with their 
loved ones. Although each of his 
/f_ilms deserves to be watched and 
watched again, his substantial 
/f_ilmography is a barrier to many 
(I myself have not yet seen all of 
his /f_ilms). /T_hus, I will attempt to 
provide a list of his most essential 
works and I wholeheartedly en -
courage anyone interested in /f_ilm 
to explore his oeuvre. 
From his time within the 
New Wave: “À bout de sou ﬄe” 
(Breathless, 1960), “Masculin 
féminin” (Masculine feminine, 
1966), “Deux ou trois choses 
que je sais d’elle” (Two or /T_hree 
/T_hings I know About Her, 1967), 
and “Week-end” (1967). Godard 
famously asserted that “All you 
need to make a movie is a girl 
and a gun” which he undoubt -
edly proved in “À bout de sou ﬄe.” 
Chock-full of references to cin -
ematic history, and an adoration 
for the Golden Age of Hollywood, 
Godard broke barriers of editing 
continuity with frequent jump 
cuts. A carefree, /f_loating, and 
fast-paced /f_ilm, “À bout de souf -
/f_le” remains the most important, 
innovative, and in /f_luential debut 
/f_ilm in the last 60 years.
Following this period, and 
picking up from the political 
ideas within “Week-end,” Godard 
formed the Dziga Vertov Group collective, predominantly with 
Jean-Pierre Gorin (a Professor 
Emeritus at UCSD!) alongside 
other /f_ilmmakers. From the col -
lective: “Le Vent d’est” (Wind 
from the East). A /f_ter the disso -
lution of the collective, Godard 
and Gorin collaborated again 
for “Tout va bien” (All’s Well). 
/T_hroughout these polemical 
/f_ilms, Godard and Gorin’s Marx -
ist viewpoints are thrust forward 
in an incensed manner, becoming 
the focus of each /f_ilm. 
Following this group’s disso -
lution, Godard began to re-exam -
ine his relationship with the me -
dium, alongside his past work. In 
“Ici et Ailleurs” (Here and Else -
where, 1976) he examines and 
critiques his own work within 
the Dziga Vertov collective, while 
demonstrating the vast di ﬀer-
ences between the life of a French 
family and the life of Palestinian 
fedayeen /f_ighters. 
A few years later, Godard re -
leased “Sauve Qui Peut (la vie)” 
(Every Man for Himself,  1980), 
which he described as his second 
/f_irst /f_ilm, marking a signi /f_icant 
shi/f_t away from the polemical 
/f_ilms he had been engaged with 
for a decade. Within this pe -
riod one must watch: “Prénom 
Carmen” (First Name: Carmen, 
1983), “Je vous salue, Marie” (Hail 
Mary, 1985), and “King Lear” 
(1987). “King Lear” remains one 
of Godard’s most outstanding 
achievements. His focus is not on 
a retelling of Shakespeare, but on 
examining the medium of /f_ilm, 
and a need for cinema to rein -
vent itself; /f_inally positing that 
he himself would be the one to 
do so. Surrounded by production disasters and thoroughly polariz -
ing critics, “King Lear” is not only 
one of his most outlandish /f_ilms 
but one I believe will be dissected 
and increasingly admired in the 
future. 
A/f_ter the turn of the cen -
tury Godard continued his ex -
perimentation with the medium. 
From this period: “Éloge de 
l’amour” (In Praise of Love, 2001), 
“Adieu au Langage” (Goodbye to 
Language, 2014), and “Le Livre 
d’image” ( /T_he Image Book, 2018).
Jean-Luc Godard posited that 
“Photography is Truth. /T_he cin -
ema is truth 24 times a second.” 
As one of the greatest artists 
to have worked within the past 
century he spent his entire life 
/f_ighting to develop the art he so 
loved, the art that was the only 
constant in his long and tumultu -
ous life. Nearly every /f_ilm he has 
made has polarized critics, being 
at once praised as a new achieve -
ment in /f_ilm and dismissed as 
self-indulgent and bizarre. A /f_ter 
his lengthy career, it is di ﬃcult to 
imagine a cinema without a place 
for Godard. /T_hough some polem -
ics argue cinema is dead and that 
without Godard it looks bleaker 
than ever, this is not the case. 
Cinema will continue to thrive, 
/f_ilmmakers across the world are 
continuing to innovate and ex -
periment. Godard brought more 
to the medium than any lover of 
cinema could have hoped for. In 
death, his creations will continue 
to be celebrated, just as they have 
in life. No, cinema will not die. 
/T_hrough his life of toil, his end -
less passion for this art form, Go -
dard has assured us of that.MON 1.09

UCSD Men’s Basketball Fails to Overcome a Slow Start 
against HawaiiLast Monday, the Cincinnati 
Bengals (11–4) were set to host 
the Bu ﬀalo Bills (12–3) for the 
/f_inal Monday night match of the 
season. Prior to the game, football 
fans across the nation were hyped 
to see the /f_irst duel between Joe 
Burrow and Josh Allen, as well as 
what the end result of this game 
would mean for the AFC stand -
ings. With playo ﬀ implications on 
the line, the game had an excit -
ing start as the Bengals marched 
down the /f_ield and Burrow struck 
immediately with a touchdown 
pass to Tyler Boyd within the 
/f_irst three minutes of game time. 
/T_he Bills answered back with a 
respectable drive of their own in 
the following set of downs, scor -
ing a /f_ield goal at the 6:52 mark 
and making it 7–3, Bengals, over 
halfway through the /f_irst. 
Cincinnati opened their next 
drive looking to pick up where 
they le /f_t oﬀ on o ﬀense by con -
tinuing to move the ball up the 
/f_ield. On the second play of the 
drive, Burrow connected with 
his receiver Tee Higgins for a /f_irst 
down conversion that positioned 
the Bengals past the 50–yard line 
and into Bu ﬀalo’s territory. In 
what /f_irst appeared to be a routine 
tackle made against Higgins, Bills 
safety Damar Hamlin was able to 
get up and stand on his feet a /f_ter 
making the defensive play, but 
within seconds of standing up, 
Hamlin unexpectedly collapsed 
and fell backwards unconscious. 
It was a shocking and frightening 
moment for all in attendance and 
those watching at home, as many 
were having a hard time process -BY LUKE REYES
/gid00020/gid00006/gid00015/gid00010/gid00016/gid00019/gid00001/gid00020/gid00017/gid00016/gid00019/gid00021/gid00020/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019ing what they had just witnessed. 
It was later revealed that Hamlin 
entered a sudden cardiac arrest af -
ter taking a blow to the chest on 
the play. 
Within nine minutes of the 
incident, an ambulance made its 
way to the 50–yard line to per -
form CPR on Hamlin, a /f_ter it was 
noted by various medical person -
nel on the /f_ield that Hamlin was 
unable to breathe on his own. For 
several more minutes, while the 
ambulance remained on the /f_ield 
as medical professionals tried 
to resuscitate Hamlin, his team -
mates and coaches knelt around 
him and prayed that he would 
pull through. A /f_ter performing 
CPR for a few more minutes, the 
medical sta ﬀ was able to get Ham -
lin’s heart beating again, and from 
there he was immediately trans -
ferred to the University of Cincin -
nati Medical Center to continue 
undergoing proper treatment. /T_he 
game was initially set to resume 
play a /f_ter a /f_ive minute suspension 
following Hamlin’s departure to 
the hospital, but the NFL, its Play -
ers Association, and both the Bills 
and Bengals eventually decided 
later that night to make the ap -
propriate decision and call o ﬀ the 
game. 
In the hours following this un -
settling incident, many Bills and 
Bengals fans in attendance went to 
University of Cincinnati Medical 
Center to show their support for 
Hamlin. Various NFL fans, play -
ers, former players, and o ﬃcial 
team accounts shared their empa -
thy towards Damar on social me -
dia by advocating to pray for him 
and his family. In the days that fol -
lowed, every NFL team changed 
their o ﬃcial social media pro /f_ile photo to a picture that showed 
his jersey number along with a 
caption that read “PRAY FOR 
DAMAR. ” Many fans and play -
ers have also donated to Hamlin’s 
GoFundMe page that he made for 
a toy drive within his community 
of McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania. 
At the moment, his charity has 
amassed over eight million dollars 
and counting, going well beyond 
the initial goal of twenty– /f_ive hun -
dred. /T_he touching support from 
the NFL community is not un -
common, but the context of near-
tragedy makes this widespread act 
of love an inspiring display of the 
best humanity has to o ﬀer. Dam -
ar’s family has publicly expressed 
their gratitude towards all who 
have supported him at this time. /T_he amount of support and 
compassion shown towards Dam -
ar and his family in recent days has 
been nothing short of remarkable. 
As fans of football, we tuned into 
last Monday’s game to feel upli /f_ted 
as we watch terri /f_ic athletes play 
the game that we all love at the 
highest level, and we get together 
to watch these games because 
sports are a gateway to unity for us 
fans who enjoy cheering on our fa -
vorite players and teams, but when 
an incident as severe as the one we 
witnessed last Monday occurs, it is 
important for all of us to acknowl -
edge that life is more important 
than a game. /T_he beauty of sports 
is that it can unite people, but our 
humanity is what should unite all 
of us. Today’s climate is divisive to say the least, but it is in these 
moments when we are united that 
we can shove aside our di ﬀerences 
and simply try to help each other 
and look ahead to the light at the 
end of the tunnel as a symbol for 
unity and a better tomorrow. 
On Wednesday night, Damar 
Hamlin regained consciousness, 
and his health continues to im -
prove. It is also worth noting that 
when he woke up, the /f_irst ques -
tion he asked was if his team won 
the game. /T_he answer to that ques -
tion is that everybody won. /T_he 
Bills won, the Bengals won, the 
NFL won, the fans won, the coun -
try won, the world won, and most 
of all, Damar and his family won.

Big West play has been /f_illed 
with highs and lows early on for 
the UC San Diego Triton Men’s 
Basketball squad, and this game 
was no di ﬀerent. Facing a talent -
ed Hawaii University (12–3, 3–0 
Big West), the Tritons struggled 
oﬀensively. Bad e ﬃciency and a 
high rate of turnovers is di ﬃcult 
to overcome when facing one of 
the best teams in the conference, 
and the Rainbow Warriors pun -
ished the Tritons from the start. 
/T_he Tritons made runs to make 
the game entertaining, but ulti -
mately struggled to /f_ind their way 
back a /f_ter surrendering a large 
de/f_icit very early in the matchup.
In the /f_irst half of play, the Tri -
tons did not start out with inspired 
play. With uncharacteristically 
leaky defense to start, the Tritons 
allowed /f_ive early /f_ield goals to 
give Hawaii an 11–4 lead at the 
15:00 minute mark of the /f_irst 
half. /T_he game of runs manifested 
itself in the Tritons closing the gap 
to one at 11–10 in two minutes 
time, capped o ﬀ by a three pointer 
from freshman guard Roddie An -
derson III. Immediately thereaf -
ter, Hawaii responded with a 6–0 
run of their own to balloon the 
lead back to seven. 
/T_he Tritons could not seem 
to kick the turnover bug in the 
/f_irst half a /f_ter opening the game 
with turnovers on consecutive 
possessions, but the o ﬀense re -
mained e ﬃcient early on to keep 
the team within striking distance. Two shots in a row from redshirt 
junior guard Bryce Pope from the 
interior were converted to cut the 
lead back down to two. /T_he con -
tinued turnovers and lack of cre -
ativity from the o ﬀense, outside 
of Pope, contributed to a crushing 
run from the Rainbow warriors, 
who went on a 14–4 run in the 
last 10 minutes of the half a /f_ter 
Pope cut it to two. Outside of two 
more Pope makes, (who /f_inished 
the half with 14, including the 
last 8) the entire team struggled 
to /f_ind good opportunities near 
the basket. /T_he Tritons were in a 
dire position going back into the locker room, down 35–21 with 
only twenty minutes le /f_t to shore 
up their decision-making.
Coach Olen must’ve said 
something inspiring in the locker 
room, because the intensity was 
markedly improved for UCSD to 
start the second half. Pope extend -
ed his streak to 10 straight points 
for the team with a smooth mid-
range shot, and the team scored 
eight unanswered points to open 
the half, led by their pestering de -
fense. Hawaii got started a /f_ter re -
grouping following a timeout, but 
the Tritons continued to storm 
back as Pope and Anderson each sank jumpers in the paint to keep 
the team close, now at a score of 
40–36 with 12:35 remaining in the 
game. 
/T_he highlight of the game 
came o ﬀ a brilliant defensive play 
from Anderson, who shot the 
passing lane for a steal and a thun -
derous dunk on the other end to 
bring the de /f_icit back down to four 
for the Tritons. /T_he back and forth 
continued as each team was giving 
it everything they got as the game 
reached its climax. /T_he defensive 
intensity was palpable with the 
game on the line, but neither team 
was giving in with each holding their own with great team play of -
fensively. Anderson continued to 
show rare poise from a freshman 
with his e ﬀectiveness on both 
sides of the ball, and the entire 
team was feeding o ﬀ of his energy. 
Clutch free throws by Anderson 
put the score at 50–46 with four 
minutes le /f_t to go in what seemed 
to be headed to a nail-biter.
Instead, the Rainbow Warriors 
suddenly pulled away. /T_he Tritons 
hung on for as long as they could, 
but Hawaii proved to have more 
gas le /f_t in the tank by /f_inishing 
the game on a 9–0 run to put the 
/f_inal tally at 62–49. /T_he Tritons 
struggled to score at the end of 
the game and were unable to get 
any stops in a game where neither 
team was particularly e ﬀective 
from the perimeter. 
/T_he adjustments made at half -
time by the coaching sta ﬀ were 
spectacular to light a /f_ire under 
the team, and although the score 
seems lopsided, the game was 
much closer than was indicated by 
the /f_inal. /T_he team cut down the 
turnovers signi /f_icantly in the sec -
ond, but was haunted by stretches 
of an absent o ﬀense and lapses on 
defense. Hawaii proved to be the 
more consistent team, but the Tri -
tons can be encouraged with a sol -
id defensive performance against 
a team that will surely be one of 
the Big West’s top contenders. 
UCSD will look to take on UC 
Riverside on Wednesday, Jan. 11 
as they attempt to get even in the 
wins and losses columns in this 
challenging Big West slate. /gid00042/gid00076/gid00064/gid00070/gid00068/gid00001/gid00066/gid00078/gid00084/gid00081/gid00083/gid00068/gid00082/gid00088/gid00001/gid00078/gid00069/gid00001/gid00034/gid00082/gid00083/gid00081/gid00078/gid00001/gid00044/gid00064/gid00065/gid00072/gid00081/gid00001/gid00078/gid00069/gid00001/gid00039/gid00075/gid00072/gid00066/gid00074/gid00081/gid00015
