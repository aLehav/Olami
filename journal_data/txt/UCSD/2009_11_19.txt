Chants of ‚ÄúWhose uni-
versity? Our univer-sity!‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre fired up ‚Äî we can‚Äôt take it 
no more!‚Äù rang through UCLA yesterday, where an estimated 500 students gathered to demonstrate against a proposed 32-percent student-fee increase. Fourteen people, including 12 students, were arrested throughout the day.
The three-day UC Board of 
Regents meeting, being held Nov. 
17 to Nov. 19, is tak-ing place in Covel Commons at UCLA. Today, the regents will vote on a con-troversial proposal 
to raise student fees at UC cam-puses by 15 percent, or $585, in the spring, and then by an addi-tional 15 percent, or $1,344, again next fall.  
The regents‚Äô Committee on 
Finance voted to pass the pro-posal yesterday, with the only dis-senting vote coming from student regent Jesse Bernal.
UC President Mark G. Yudof

Proposal would charge 
students $4.47 per quarter;  Loft director claims venue desperate for funding.Council 
Puts off Loft Fee Discussion
By Angela Chen
Associate News Editor
The A.S. Council voted 15-4-2 
last night to postpone a decision on 
whether to sponsor a proposed ref-erendum that would increase student fees to fund the Loft, Price Center East‚Äôs concert venue. Discussion of the issue was put off until the third week of Winter Quarter.
If passed, the referendum would 
create $4.47 in additional fees for undergraduates and $3.82 for gradu-
ates. Additionally, the proposal would require that at least 80 percent of all events at the Loft be pay-as-you-can for UCSD students and 
that undergraduates represent at least 60 percent of the venue‚Äôs hiring staff. 
Last year, councilmembers debated 
a similar Loft ref-erendum, which would have implemented a fee of $2.62. The council  ulti-mately rejected the proposal due to concerns with student oversight.  The suggested fee has such risen, partly due to a differ-ence in enroll-ment numbers, but also because Loft representa-tives requested a larger lump sum.
‚ÄúLast year, we 
hoped that we would be receiv-ing more money from registration fees, ‚Äù Loft director Martin Wollesen said. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, with budget cuts, this was unable to happen. ‚Äù 
According to Wollesen, without 
the proposed fee, the Loft will be unable to maintain programming, resulting in admission changes and student lay-offs. 
Student oversight, a main factor 
in the debate over last year‚Äôs Loft pro-posal, was also a decisive factor in the council‚Äôs discussion last night.
The oversight language outlined 
in the referendum was approved by 
the majority of the A.S. special com-
mittee formed to discuss the referen-dum. Wollesen also said he found the level of student oversight provided for in the original referendum to be acceptable, but Gupta said that EDITORIAL
The fee hike 
is about to pass. What next?
See FEES, page 3Upward Trend
UC student fees have 
increased every year for the last eight years. Today, the UC Board of Regents will vote on two additional increases ‚Äì which will bring in a total of $262.2 mil-lion in new revenue ‚Äì to help offset a drastic reduction in state funding.

Researchers Visualize Bacterial Chatter
By Regina Ip
Staff Writer
A breakthrough in visualizing 
how bacterial communication may 
lead to the discovery of drugs that could be capable of tackling diseases and infections caused by bacteria and microbes, like cancer, diabetes, ulcers and allergies.
UCSD researchers used a revo-
lutionary imaging technique called Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight mass spec-trometry to see how bacteria commu-nicate, allowing them to observe the chemical signals that are exchanged. Before this type of imaging mass spec-trometry, which was normally used to determine the properties of chemical structures, there were no tools that could study cell-to-cell communica-tion of microorganisms involving multiple signals.
 ‚ÄúNow what we have the capac-
ity to do is to see the communica-tion in a multiplexed fashion, ‚Äù Pieter Dorrestein, assistant professor at UCSD‚Äôs Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a really distinct and significant advantage over what has been done in the past. ‚Äù
Deciphering how microorganisms 
communicate is essential to under-standing how their signals can change or influence the behavior of neighbor-ing organisms. 
Now that researchers have an 
imaging technique to observe these signals, they can isolate signaling molecules ‚Äì which have the ability to inhibit the growth of other organisms ‚Äì to create antibiotic, antiviral, anti-fungal or even  anticancer drugs.
 ‚Äú A big part in the development of 
new drugs begins with an observation that an organism makes an activity that inhibits the growth of another organism, ‚Äù Paul Straight, assistant pro-fessor of biochemistry and biophysics at Texas A&M University, said.  ‚ÄúWe can now see, in the genome of many different bacteria and fungi and other organisms, that they can potentially make compounds that have never been seen before.  What we can do now is scan these and screen them in a way that opens up our access to higher diversity of potential therapeu-tics from any given organism. ‚Äù 
The research collaboration drew 
on Dorrestein‚Äôs knowledge of new technologies in mass spectrometry, Straight‚Äôs concentration in microbial interactions and UCSD post-doctoral students Yu-Liang Y ang‚Äôs and Yuquan 
Xu‚Äôs expertise in the modification of bacterial growth. 
Dorrestein‚Äôs lab is now studying 
how different molecules interact  and if those molecules have potential therapeutic value.  This research may allow scientists to translate bacterial 
language into a database that docu-ments signaling molecules and their functions. 
Microbes use molecules like 
penicillin to communicate with their environment.  Bacteria, however, secrete a large number of these mol-ecules instead of just one molecule.  Each of the molecules communicates something different.  Due to the study, researchers can now understand what the molecules are communicating, which they have been unable to do in the past.    
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre excited, ‚Äù Y ang said. ‚ÄúThere 
is a new problem that we can figure out and can ask more questions about. ‚Äù 
The team is beginning to work 
with biotech companies and agricul-tural businesses to see if their research can be used to change and improve existing medical products.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also very rewarding to do this 
kind of collaborative  research where two different groups that have two separate types of scientific focus can share their expertise and get science done that way, ‚Äù Straight said.
Texas A&M University, the 
National Institutes of Health and the Beckman Foundation, a charitable organization that supports scientific research, funded the project.

SUNNY-SIDE UP By Philip Rhie
wron g.
The bishops  absur dly condemned 
the pre-a mendment plan  as an 
‚Äúaccountin g gimmick, ‚Äù seein g as the 
bill as propose d woul d fund abortion-
coverin g insurers, but woul dn‚Äôt 
actually  use tax dollars  to pay for 
abortions.  The group  threatene d to 
with draw support  for the legislation  
unless the bill inclu ded a stipulation  
that prohibite d federal money  from 
going to any insurance  provi der 
that covere d abortion  ‚Äî ‚Äúforcin g‚Äù 
Democrats who  needed an official  
OK from those  pointy-hatte d zealots  
to with draw their support  for the bill.
So much for separation  of church  
and state.
The USCCB wields this ridiculous  
upper  hand thanks  to votin g clout  of 
68 million Catholics in the U.S., as 
well as the fervent  political  activis m 
of its members ‚Äî who  are regularly  
in contact with  lawm akers  ‚Äî upon  
who m they  don‚Äôt hesitate to rain 
input. R ecently, the group  distribute d 
fliers to every  parish  in the nation  
askin g church goers to pray  for abor-
tion restrictions  and contact repre -
sentatives,  encoura ging them to push  
for bills in their favor.  
The amendment‚Äôs very  real inclu -
sion transcen ds the often  theoreti -
cal church-state separation  debate.  
Shoul d it beco me law, the measure  
woul d likely  force  insurers (87 
percent of which currently  cover  
abortions ) to drop abortions  from 
their plans  in order to meet the new  
health-care m arket.
The final  bill reveals  the discon -
certin g influence our country‚Äôs  reli-
gious leaders have  over  their g overn -
ment. Bishops  now  have  even  more 
proof  that they  can be a dominatin g 
force  in politics  ‚Äî a  disturbin g pros--
pect  that threatens  the separation  of 
church  and state.
So ‚Äî despite  consid erable biparti i
san support  ‚Äî the  USCCB‚Äôs heavy  
behin d-the-scenes  lobbyin g and 
grassroots  organization left the bill 
tainte d by religious doctrine.  And 
suddenly,  thanks  to some influential l Raise your  hand if you‚Äôre  as 
burnt  out on bein g angry 
about  the impending student-
fee increases as we are. The picket  
signs, teach-ins, heartbreakin g anec-
dotal foru ms, commissions on the 
future  ‚Äî all  gallant  efforts towar d 
chan ge ‚Äî see m to be rilin g a stag-
nant  sort of heat.  Nobo dy can take  
another  financial  hit in this econo my, 
and the UC Boar d of Regents has no 
goddamn idea what  to do about  it.
We‚Äôre  tryin g our hardest to avoid 
a defeatist  attitu de, and, ultimately,  
we woul d like to commend the 
protestors.  The Sept.  24 walkout,  
thou gh conducte d with  a not-so-
community-buil ding ruthlessness  
and somewhat  meager turnout
compared to Berkeley,  was UCSD‚Äôs  
biggest rebel-rouser since the Prop.  8 
fiasco : a refreshin g shot  of outcry  we 
coul d all care about.  
But it doesn‚Äôt come 
as much surprise  that 
the walkouts  ended 
there.  Principally,  
we‚Äôre  all students, not 
professional protes -
tors ‚Äî even  those  
designate d to protest  
by student councils  and orgs have  an 
outsid e life to deal with.  So, thank  
youfortryin g It‚Äôseasy forignorant,  youfortryin g.Itseasy  for ignorant,thats  the thats the fault  of those  w
out there,  not those  who  made what -
ever  push  they  coul d.
That  said, the intention of student 
govern ment syste mwideto camp 
out at the Nov.  17 re gents m eet-
ing ‚Äî where  they  will vote  on a 
32-percent student-fee  increase ‚Äî is  
a waste  of momentum . We need to 
choose  a battle  with  at least some 
sliver of hope  for victory.  Despite  
any illusions  of a ‚Äúpublic  comment 
perio d‚Äù the regents decided on this 
fee increase a long time ago. There is 
not a chance  in hell they‚Äôll  compro-
mise the presti ge of our university  
or make more faculty  cuts to keep  
student fees low ‚Äî especially  know -
ing there  will always  be applicants  
too apathetic  or uncarin g to resist  a 
heftier tuition  bill (or resist  handing 
it off to their parents ).
Sure,  the protests have  been  
enou gh to scare  UC Presid ent Mark  
G. Yudof into the depths of his office,  
spittin g out lionhearte d letters  to 
avoid facin g the pisse d-off students 
and staff  stomping aroun d his cam-
puses. We also seem to have  scared 
him into proppin g up a mighty fine 
financial-ai d plan  (thou gh who  
knows, m aybe  that grand gesture  
flowe d from the sheer  kindness  of 
his Blue  and Gold heart ). The fact 
that the UCSD financial  aid depart -
ment has alrea dy sent 2009- 10 
grant recipients its update d Winter  
Quarter allocations to acco mmo-
date  the fee increase ‚Äî a  paranoi d 
effort to qual m pre-decision fears  or 
outra ge ‚Äî is  a clear  indication that 
the regents alrea dy have  their m inds 
made up.
It is indeed necessary to show  
the regents that there  will always  be 
a pack  of watch dogs on their every  
move. But student leaders hold an 
even  greater  responsibility : to find 
ways of makin g a real chan ge. It‚Äôs a 
much m ore dauntin g and unstable  
task ‚Äî an d requires breakin g away  
from the standard march  down  
Library  Walk  ‚Äî but  we‚Äôve  got to 
target the only  real source of fund-
ing left in this devastatin g statewi de ing ga variety of causes less impactful  f l i tf l
(albeit  noble ) to the future  of our 
state  and nation.
What  we really  need, of course,  
is a constitutional  convention  to 
chan ge our state‚Äôs  voter-locke d fund-
ing metho ds which m ake it virtually  
impossible  for legislators  to shave  
spare  chan ge off less-hurtin g tax 
recipients. Chances are,even  our 
hard-jawe d governor  woul d find it in 
his heart  to fund higher education if 
he had some more leg room to ration  
the bank  account ‚Äî an d many other  
legislators  have  expresse d a stron g 
desire to 
support  the 
University  of 
California.  
With  a 
slightly 
social -
ist move 
towar d more 
govern ment-
controlle d 
tax revenue,  
it woul d 
just take  a 
few simpler 
‚Äúmarches  on 
Sacra mento‚Äù  
‚Äî as Yudof so heroically  put it ‚Äî to  
cure  the rise in student fees. May‚Äôs  
statewi de ballot  measures, under 
the protection  of 1B, attempted to 
preserve as much emergency  funding 
for education as possible.  In the end, 
it was California voters  who  trashe d 
it. We need to make these  voters  see 
how  important  an affor dable  educa-
tion is to their personal  and public  
future.
A.S. Presid ent Utsav  Gupta  has 
discusse d a possible  effort to lobby  
the San Dieg o community  for its 
support  of the UC cause.  However,  
there  are no signs of interest  so far 
from his External  Affairs  counter -
parts  in jumping on the initiative. I f 
any of the A.S. budget or manpower  
was allotte d to lettin g Californians  
know  the dire situation we‚Äôre  in, we 
might finally  be makin g some head-
ffdblft here it i ffdable future where itand see Yudof s name in the news andseeYudof snameinthenews -
paper,  but unless they  have  a child 
currently  enrolle d in the university  
or are themselves  alumni, the public-
education plight is not necessarily  
at the top of their list of budgetary  
concerns.  
Here‚Äôs  an idea: we band together  
to run a public infor mation  cam-
paign targeting voters.  We ask them 
‚ÄúWhere  woul d you be without  your  
colleg e education? ‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhere  will 
your  child/co mmunity  be without 
the same?‚Äù and sprea d it statewi de 
on mailbox  flyers  and public service  
announce ments, askin g Californians  
to bug their representatives  in 
Sacra mento, or just keep  the cause 
in m ind on a future  ballot.  Throug h 
these  efforts we might come that 
much closer to convincin g those  who  
have  the power  to make a difference  
that access  to public higher educa-
tion is worthy  of their support.
Unfortunately,  at this point,  
by targeting Yudof and the dead-
spirite d regents, we‚Äôre  attempting 
to beat  down  a bolte d gate  with  an 
insufficient army. Maybe  they‚Äôre  just 
not bein g creative enou gh in the 
search  for alternative  funding ‚Äî or  
are too wussy  to try and push  aroun d 
the millions in graduate  research  ‚Äî 
but the fact is, the leaders of the UC 
syste m have  not foun d a solution  to 
maintain  the quality  of the university  
without  additional  support  from stu-
dent fees. So let‚Äôs stop  complainin g 
and find it ourselves.)P = + * LN))[\PM=+*WIZLWN)

Plans for Year-Round Sun God, Greek Store
By Ayelet Bitton
Staff Writer
In an attempt to cater to a per-
ceived student demand for A.S. 
merchandise and Greek apparel, 
A.S. councilmembers are slowly but surely hammering out a business proposal for a permanent A.S. store, to be completed and submitted to the University Center Advisory Board by the end of Fall Quarter 2009.
For the past several years, the 
A.S. Council has set aside a few weeks during Spring Quarter to 
open a temporary venue for its Sun God paraphernalia. Over the past 
six months, however, the council has looked to make the store a per-manent fixture that would operate throughout the entire school year and offer an expanded range of mer-chandise, including more council and Greek-related stock.
Councilmembers set up a com-
mittee at the start of Fall Quarter to 
address the feasibility of the store and how to make it a reality. According to committee chair and campuswide senator Tobias Haglund, the com-mittee‚Äôs work is nearing completion.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hoping to have the pro-
posal ready for UCAB by the end of the quarter, ‚Äù Haglund said.
Once a proposal is submitted and 
accepted by UCAB, councilmembers can focus on other aspects of the store such as its location and con-struction. After a plan is approved, it typically takes anywhere from six 
months to a year for a store to open, 
University Centers Director Paul Terzino said.
‚ÄúFor this kind of business, it 
might take three to nine months, ‚Äù Terzino said. ‚ÄúUntil we see a business plan though, it‚Äôs really hard to tell. ‚Äù
Councilmembers hope to have 
the store open by Spring Q uarter 
2010, but they may be forced to post-
pone the opening until Fall Quarter 
2010 if the plan is approved, Vice 
President of Finance and R esources Committee members 
meet to discuss business model for for school merchandise venue.

Tensions were high last night 
between councilmembers and advocates for the Loft as the 
twice-failed-in-the-past-two-years, now newly revised, Loft fee referen-dum was brought yet again to the A.S. table at yesterday‚Äôs council meeting. 
About 30 Loft street team mem-
bers brought 1,500 student signatures and personal testimonies in hopes of swaying coun-cilmembers to support the $4.47 per student per quarter fees for increased fund-ing for the Loft.
An hour-long 
public input period followed, as various Loft lovers rose to speak on the venue‚Äôs behalf.  
‚ÄúWe want to promote diversity and 
we‚Äôve done that through our events from wine tasting to drag shows, ‚Äù Loft lover and Marshall senior Rob Corea  
said. ‚ÄúWe offer something unique to this college community. ‚Äù 
However, Muir Commuter Council 
co-chair Claire Luciano  presented ten 
reasons why the council should not support the Loft‚Äôs fee referendum. 
‚ÄúThe Loft is a valuable space, but it 
needs to be a business and not come crying to A.S. every six months for a referendum, ‚Äù Luciano said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs insult-ing and disgusting that we know when we have other fee increases to think about, that there‚Äôs this Loft referen-dum. ‚Äù  
During member reports, Vice 
President of Finance and Resources Peter Benesch informed the council that funds from the A.S. Soft Reserves were down 45 percent from last quar-ter, but a plan is set for a campaign next quarter to boost sales. 
After various, seemingly insig-
nificant member reports, the council returned to the issue of the Loft.  
The A.S. Special Committee to Review the Proposed University Centers Programming Fee voted earlier to bring the referendum to the council in hopes of a passing vote to put the fee a Winter Quarter 2010 spe-cial election ballot. 
The committee‚Äôs hopes and the 
Loft lovers‚Äô testimonies only did so much. Councilmembers voted 15-4-2 to postpone the vote for the Loft refer-
endum until third week of Winter Quarter 2010. 
Because the 
council voted to postpone the issue until Winter Quarter, the Loft referendum fee 
could only make it onto the Spring Quarter ballot if approved. No addi-tional funding would go toward the Loft until Fall Quarter 2010 at the earliest. 
VP Student Life Riscie Hernandez, 
who served on the Special Committee, was visibly unhappy with her fellow councilmembers‚Äô decision.  
During question time, Benesch, 
on behalf of an absent Associate Vice President of Enterprise Operations Rishi Ghosh, explained the plans for the Grove Cafe. Plans for mini-pizzas, the use of dining dollars and a more sustainable cafe are in the works. The revamped Grove is set to open first week of Winter Quarter.  
Councilmembers sang ‚ÄúHappy 
Birthday‚Äù to AVP Diversity Affairs Jasmine Phillips and congratulated Executive Assistant Heather Lucas on 
her recent engagement. 
Despite the minute of cheer, hard 
feelings still remained. 
‚ÄúI have lost every bit of respect 
for you, ‚Äù Hernandez said, addressing the council. ‚ÄúY ou all can take some responsibility for deteriorating student life on this campus for the next two months. ‚Äù

that would otherwise be cut by cre-
ating millions of dollars in new net revenue.  
Almost an hour after a public 
comment period was supposed to have ended, the meeting was inter-rupted repeatedly by loud outbursts from the 50 audience members who had come to offer their input, prompting police to arrest eight people from the crowd at approxi-mately 10 a.m.
Students spoke out against the 
fee hikes throughout the day.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm an independent student; 
I don‚Äôt have parents to help sup-port me, ‚Äù UCLA sophomore Chloe Underdue said. ‚ÄúI work every day in the dining halls. I‚Äôm from the projects in San Francisco, and I can‚Äôt afford these fee increases. I don‚Äôt think money should stop me from getting a good education. This is something I need to be a part of. I can‚Äôt go to class today knowing I might not be able to return next quarter because I can‚Äôt afford it. ‚Äù
Joining the protest were dozens 
of staff and facultymembers, as well as members of AFSCME Local 3299, a union representing over 20,000 UC service and patient-care work-ers. 
Though the demonstration 
began without incident, the mood quickly turned sour once police offi-cers ‚Äî clad in riot gear and armed with batons and guns ‚Äî formed a line around the Covel Commons, demanding that protestors move back. Officers soon erected barri-cades in front of the entrance to the building.
Several students were hurt after 
a group of protestors rushed the barricades in front of the premises at about 11:15 a.m., a UCPD officer said. The ensuing scuffles between police and protestors culminated in an additional five arrests.
According to several protesters at 
the scene, a bottle of liquid, possibly vinegar, was thrown at police, and officers began tasing students, strik-ing them with batons and pointing their guns in an effort to quell the demonstration. After the crowd was dispersed, a group of angry protes-tors, some crying, confronted the officers. 
‚ÄúHow can you do this?‚Äù one 
woman screamed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you have kids? Y ou‚Äôre making me lose faith in people. ‚Äù
UCLA sophomore Y olanda 
Stephanie De Loera said that she is the first person in her family to go to college, but fears that high tuition 
may force her out of school. 
‚ÄúWe went in there to protest for 
our rights, because we‚Äôre students 
and we have that voice, but they cut them off [in the middle of] their speech, ‚Äù De Loera said. ‚Äú And then we got tased and pepper-sprayed for doing a protest for our education. We were forced out of the delibera-
tion room. That cannot be done. I 
got a gun taken out on me. People are being physically, mentally and emotionally hurt right now. ‚Äù
Demonstrators then moved to 
the east side of the building, where student regent Jesse Bernal and stu-dent regent-designate Jesse Cheng

Swiping that first Tootsie Pop 
from the local corner store before puberty taught How-to 
Guru an important lesson: Free food tastes better. 
And UCSD certainly doesn‚Äôt have 
a shortage. The temptation of a free slice of pepperoni seldom fails to rally the troops to the most forlorn corners of Sixth College ‚Äî even when it first requires enduring a half-hour presentation on marching for Jesus. But the endless string of cam-pus freebies does occasionally dry up. When they do, supermarket samples are available to exploit year-round.
From Costco to Trader Joe‚Äôs 
to W h
ole Foods to our very own 
Sunshine Market, a whole world of free samples is yours for the grazing ‚Äî if you know where to stick your nose.¬†
The first step to scoring a free-
sample dinner: Scout the area. Awareness of your surroundings is instrumental in your exploitation of any squeaky-clean, tile-floored environs. Note all employees watch-ing and judge their level of interest in their minimum-wage work. Some celebrate their Ralphs-embroidered polo-shirt uniform, and will jump on any opportunity to scold you. Others wouldn‚Äôt bat an eye if you shoved a watermelon up your shirt and booked it to Starbucks. 
Keeping up appearances for the 
former will help you pass as a genu-ine customer, so make sure to push a shopping cart sprinkled with a few choice items for distraction. A single free-range chicken or chunk of imported French cheese should serve well to prevent any suspiscion of foul play.
Second: Seek out the finger food. 
Any snack sold in bulk with a con-venient self-serve shovel (nuts, dried fruit, granola, jelly beans) is right-fully yours for the tasting. Do not, however, extend your grimy paw into a food bin; not only is such behavior unsanitary, it will call immediate, red-handed attention to your trans-gression. 
Use the tongs at the olive bar to 
pluck a single morsel, then grab it with your fingers and stuff it in your salivating maw. The object of the game, after all, is to look as incon-spicuous as possible to achieve maxi-mum sample-meal volume.
Third: Never make eye contact. 
Aim to be invisible ‚Äî this way you‚Äôll attract minimum attention. It‚Äôs also critical to always keep moving. Lurking in the same snack aisle for a minute too long makes you a prime 
target for neurotic employees and 
undercover theft preventers.
It should be noted that tasting 
fruit is easiest. If there aren‚Äôt any employees around (or even if there are), grabbing a handful of grapes here or an apple there to brazenly munch on while shopping has never been denounced in How-to Guru‚Äôs experience. Besides, what other pur-
pose could there possibly be for the 
produce-section trash bins than as a place to toss your apple core?
But if you‚Äôre going for quantity 
See GURU page 7
Like everything else in this failed state economy, the Loft ‚Äî that haven of commercialized alternativeness on the second floor of Price Center East ‚Äî is broke. And, like others in need (cough, 
Parking and Transportation Services), the fledgling concert venue wants us to drag it out of the red by approving another student fee ‚Äî this one through an Associated Students referendum that, if passed by a majority of the student body with at least 20 percent turnout, would charge under-grads $4.47 and grad students $3.82 per quarter to fund the nightclub-turned-cafe.  
Though the Loft originally aimed to present its referendum to stu-
dents next quarter, Wednesday night‚Äôs A.S. Council meeting shelved discussion on the matter until Week 3 of Winter Quarter. We believe the council was justified in putting off the decision until the referendum is rewritten. 
It‚Äôs true that the Loft serves a unique purpose. Nowhere else on cam-
pus will you find a Latin American chocolate-tasting one night and an experimental string quartet playing the next. In its first year of business, the venue‚Äôs not only succeeded in drawing hour-long lines for popular acts like the band Why? with pay-as-you-can programming, it‚Äôs also given everyone something better to do on a Thursday night than get a head start on that Dostoevsky essay.
Y et there, in one of its greatest strengths, also lies the 
Loft‚Äôs inherent limitation: despite the diversity of the ven-
ue‚Äôs programming, it still appeals most to a thin slice of the student body. The average UCSD student isn‚Äôt interested in parting with his chemistry book or makeshift beer pong table on any night of the week ‚Äî neither for the promise of a wine tasting nor of a memorable set from Metronomy. Even if he wanted to attend a show at the Loft, the space‚Äôs tiny 235-person maximum capacity may well prohibit his entry anyway. For as many free shows as the Loft gives us, there‚Äôs never any guarantee that a night begun at the back of the line will end in a dreamy post-show haze.
In Winter Quarter 2009, the Loft proposed a much smaller quarterly 
fee of $2.62 (which failed to rally enough A.S. Council support to get it on the ballot). But thanks to shrinking enrollment and insufficient registra-tion-fee funding, Martin Wollesen, director of the university events office, decided to up that figure to $4.47. But increased need or not, the entire student body shouldn‚Äôt have to pay so much for a free perk that the select few Buddy Holly-lookalikes among us take advantage of. The Loft, after all, is a business ‚Äî one that, with a regular contingent of non-student concertgoers, isn‚Äôt intended solely for our own weeknight amusement.
But as for the referendum itself, one of its most glaring issues, as it 
went before the council Wednesday night, was its lack of provisions for student oversight. The proposal, as drafted by the A.S. Special Committee to Review the Proposed University Centers Programming Fee, only required the University Centers Advisory Board and A.S. Council to give a yearly OK to how our fees are spent. All else would be out of student control.
A.S. President Utsav Gupta believes that kind of oversight is insuf-

You know things are heating up 
when the cops bust out their riot gear. 
Kevlar vests, rubber bullets, stun 
guns and tear gas canisters rarely accompany sunshine and happiness. Zip ties, broken bottles and screams of anger typically signal a ‚Äòshit has hit the fan‚Äô type scenario, wherein some group of individuals is exceptionally pissed off and another is exceptionally nervous. 
That was the scene yesterday when 
hundreds of students gathered outside UCLA ‚Äôs Covel Commons, picket signs in hand as they bellowed their oppo-sition to a controversial 32-percent fee-hike proposal. Tensions were high and tears were shed. Protestors threw bottles and police officers replied with Tasers. At one point, a group of stu-dents rushed the door. Over a dozen people were arrested.
Somewhere inside the red brick 
building sat the regents, their minds already made up. The fee increases will pass. That decision was finalized a long time ago, away from angry mobs or tear-streaked cries of betrayal. This meeting is a symbolic affair. Like an awards show but without the applause.
The thing about the UC Board of 
Regents is that no matter how vio-lent a protest gets or how dramatic a scene it are confronted with, it remain completely unaffected. At the end of the day, a few hundred people storm-ing around with cardboard signs is a relatively small inconvenience. Local newspapers will run a couple of sto-ries. There might even be an iconic photograph or two (see: page three). But soon the hype will pass, and everything will go back to normal.
Until next year, that is, when the 
board decides to raise fees yet again. 
And that right there is the heart of 
the problem. This whole unfortunate charade is an unending cycle. A simi-lar protest took place last year, and the year before. Another one will take place next year and probably the year after that. A protest alone is simply ineffective. It is a flash in the pan, a brief moment of disarray that quickly fades from memory if left without the support of a larger political movement to carry on the momentum.
Anyone can yell angrily at a wall 
of police officers. It takes real orga-nization and real political action to produce something worthwhile out of all that anger. The scene at UCLA will keep repeating itself over and over again unless some fundamental change is made in the way we address the problem of rising fees. The first thing we need to realize is that the regents are not the enemy ‚Äî they‚Äôre just the most convenient targets. The real problem is the state Legislature, a governing body that has repeatedly demonstrated its disinterest in the wellbeing of our university systems. 
Last week, the Guardian  editorial 
board suggested that student lead-ers pool their resources to launch a statewide public awareness campaign aimed at California voters. The mes-sage: public universities are in trouble. We would broadcast the message in television ads, print it on pamphlets, scatter it across the Internet and rein-force it through frequent discussion. The campaign would shift our focus from the regents to the Legislature, making this fight something more than a useless internal skirmish. Rather than going through the same tired motions year after year, we would be working to enact last-ing political change by convincing California‚Äôs electorate to make public universities a priority.
Politicians listen, especially when 
their reelection prospects are in jeopardy. But that will only happen if higher education becomes a politi-cal issue, something voters can get angry about, put on bumper stickers, talk about at work and hear about on television. 
Isolated protests won‚Äôt raise the 
awareness necessary to affect change. It‚Äôs time to try something new.  
?M¬º^M/W\\PM5WUMV\]U¬∏4M\¬º[:]V?Q\P1\
-,1<7:1)4
ficient ‚Äî and we agree. It‚Äôs not uncommon for university officials to misappropriate student activity fees for purposes other than what we the students want (see: tread-mill-less RIMAC Annex). 
To eliminate those surprise mis-
uses, Gupta proposed a revised ref-erendum Wednesday night which would grant students far more oversight. His plan would create a student-majority Loft governance board to keep an eye on how our fees are spent. It would also require the council to approve the Loft‚Äôs operating budget with a two-thirds majority vote each year ‚Äî both of which, we believe, would adequate-ly address the oversight issue. 
Gupta‚Äôs plan doesn‚Äôt stop there. 
It also demands that half of the Loft‚Äôs events (rather than the cur-rent 20 percent) be set aside for student org events, with special weekly priority for A.S. Concerts and Events shows on Friday and Saturday nights.
But as much as we love empow-
erment, a fee-supported Loft that‚Äôs forced to bend over backward for student orgs would ultimately suf-fer. A new programming philosophy that prioritizes college-sponsored root-beer pong over Jens Lekman concerts would ruin the reason we like the Loft so much now ‚Äî the programming is actually good. 
There‚Äôs a reason professionals 
curate the Loft: because they know, better than any mighty A.S. appoin-tee, how to organize a compelling lineup of events. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs not our job as students to replace those professionals ‚Äî we just have to ensure they don‚Äôt pull a disappearing act with our fees.‚ñ∂ LOFT, MYVTWHNL);\]LMV\.MML4WN\

Yudof said. ‚ÄúActuall
y, we spend only 
two out of three of the dollars that 
we spend out of student fees. Two -
thirds of it goes to the instruction  
program and the like, and the other 
one-third goes to incr
easing finan-
cial aid.‚Äù 
One way that Yudof tried to scare 
students into acceptin g increa sed 
fees is to tell them that if they do  not 
accept
 the increa ses, the quality of 
undergraduate  education will suffer.
‚ÄúAnd the enem y in all of this is 
mediocrit y,‚Äù Yudof said. ‚ÄúWe can 
make your classes bigger, it can take 
you longer to get your degrees [
and] 
class access is worse. We can do a 
lot of things to achieve mediocrit y 
‚Äî in fact, mediocrit y is fair ly easy 
to achieve. B ut we‚Äôre not going to do 
that.‚Äù 
The problem with this stat ement  
is that class sizes have already gone 
up, and the num ber of classes has 
already gone down.  In other words, 
the system is both raising fees and 
lowerin g the quality of educatio n at 
the same time.  
One of Yudof‚Äô s  most question-
able moment s came  when he acted 
surpri sed to hear that class sizes are 
expanding and that programs are 
being reduced.
‚ÄúWe are gettin g mor
e and more  report s of large classes and closed 
section s,‚Äù he said.
 It seems that Yudof has forgotten  
that throughout the summer, h e was 
telling ever yone that there wou ld be 
expanded class sizes and fewe
r class 
offerings due to the state funding 
reduction.  
Instead of limitin g enro llment  
and raising fees, union s and student 
group s argue that the Univer sity 
of California  shou ld just use the  
mone y it has to get itself through 
the current  reduction in state funds. 
After all, the total UC b udget is $20 
billion, and the state reduction was 
$600 million, which is less than 3 
percen
t of the budget. 
While Yudof usually says that 
the Univer sity of California  cannot  
borrow  its way out of the situation,  
he does admit h ere that they could 
finan
ce their way out of the current  
problem as a last resort. We shou ld 
not forget that right after the state 
reduced the UC b udget, the univer -
sity turne d aroun d and then lent 
$200 million to the sta te. 
The first step is stoppin g Yudof 
and others in claimin g that saying 
‚Äòno‚Äô to new fees will result in UC 
povert y. We must deman d that the 
univer sity starts repre sentin g its 
financia l status in  a clear and consis-
tent manner.

Peter Benesch said.
‚ÄúIn an ideal world, I would like to 
have this up and ready to go before 
Sun God this year, ‚Äù Benesch said. ‚ÄúHaving it open for more or less a quarter would be great in terms of getting ourselves visible to the UCSD community for the next fall. In a more realistic world though, it may be opening the beginning of fall ‚Äî it‚Äôs really hard to predict. ‚ÄùWhile the council‚Äôs first step in 
constructing the store is completing a proposal for UCAB, there are many other obstacles after that.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not solely dependent on our 
efforts, ‚Äù Benesch said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs actually dependent on a lot of administra-tors and committees deciding they‚Äôre willing to undergo this venture. We have UCAB, approval of vice chan-cellors after that, the A.S. Council has to approve of it ‚Äî several admin-istrative steps need to be taken. ‚Äù
A major issue in the creation of 
the store is determining where on campus it would be located.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking at any open spaces 
in Price Center ‚Äî maybe in the old post office area or across from the Loft, ‚Äù Haglund said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just look-ing to get an idea in our heads of what it would look like. ‚Äù
According to Terzino, should the 
A.S. store take up shop in Price Center, the council will likely pay a much lower rent than other non-student businesses on campus.
‚ÄúWe are hoping to get a break 
on rent, ‚Äù Haglund said. ‚ÄúIf not, we understand the position UCAB is in. We do hope that is some-thing that would be available to us though, since we do offer a service to students along with just mer-chandise. ‚Äù
While most vendors generally 
pay between $3 and $5 per square foot each month in rent, University Centers may be willing to offer the store a lower rate.
‚ÄúIt depends on what‚Äôs being sold 
and how much revenue they expect, ‚Äù Terzino said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of a broad range. ‚Äù
Once created, the A.S. store would 
draw half of its profits from Greek apparel, a quarter from Sun God mer-chandise and the final quarter from seasonal items such as graduation or holiday-related items, Benesch said. The council wants to ensure that no items would overlap with the book-store‚Äôs merchandise.
‚ÄúStudents want to enjoy the uni-
versity, ‚Äù Benesch said. ‚ÄúThey are very proud of events like Sun God. They enjoy them, and we want to give them things that can commemorate these things they are proud of. ‚Äù 
Readers can contact Ayelet Bitton at 
arbitton@ucsd.edu.were told they would be better heard by the regents. Several speakers urged the crowd to continue pro-testing, despite the Committee on Finance‚Äôs  vote to approve the fee increase. 
‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt give a shit, ‚Äù UC 
Students Association President Victor Sanchez said. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt even look at us during public com-ment. What does that say? We need to reclaim our education ‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre going to head back up there now. We‚Äôre going to be back here tomor-row, tonight and make sure the stu-dent voice is heard. ‚Äù
UCLA Labor Director Kent 
Wong spoke out against the use of weapons by UCPD police.
‚ÄúUniversity police shouldn‚Äôt be 
pointing guns in students‚Äô faces, ‚Äù Wong said, eliciting loud cheers from the crowd. ‚ÄúThis is a peaceful, non-violent protest. [There has been an] unacceptable use of batons and Tasers. It is a disgrace when power structures in California are trying to 
balance the budgets on the backs of students and workers. A disgrace!‚Äù
Second-year graduate student and 
teaching assistant Mzilikazi Kon√© said students should be angry about being made to bear the brunt of the cuts. 
‚ÄúStudents are paying more for 
less quality, ‚Äù Kon√© said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think [the regents] are going to change their minds, or that they‚Äôre even listening to us ‚Ä¶ [but] this protest is about us ‚Äî students, faculty and staff ‚Äî coming together and build-ing a movement around this issue. ‚Äù
Protestors from across the state 
will be gathering at an overnight on-campus ‚Äútent city‚Äù to continue protesting Thursday.
Organizers of the event, called 
Crisis Fest, plan to have discussions of the international student move-ment, dodgeball & frisbee matches, workshops, live music and a General Assembly to discuss the future of the movement.

the amount of power students would receive over Loft operations was not extensive enough. 
In its current form, the refer-
endum would give the University Centers Advisory Board the ability to review and approve the allocation of funds for the Loft each year by major-ity vote. UCAB would also be able to reduce or eliminate the fee entirely if two-thirds of all voting UCAB stu-dent members at two consecutive meetings vote as such. 
Gupta said the delegation of over-
sight was a problem.
‚ÄúThe majority of the student over-
sight goes toward UCAB, ‚Äù Gupta said. ‚ÄúUCAB mainly deals with facilities management and doesn‚Äôt have expe-rience in running programs, so it doesn‚Äôt seem to make sense that A.S. input is minimal. ‚Äù
A.S. Associate Vice President of 
Academic Affairs and UCAB chair Jordan Taylor said UCAB is capable of handling the responsibilities. 
‚ÄúUCAB may deal primarily with 
structures, but we‚Äôre more than land-lords, ‚Äù Taylor said. ‚ÄúThis new pro-grammatic aspect is a role that UCAB is suited for. ‚Äù
Gupta drafted several amendments 
to the proposal that would change the oversight structure to create a stu-dent majority Loft governing board. Members of the board would be appointed by students and have gov-ernance over the Loft‚Äôs entire budget.‚ÄúIf passed, students will be pay-
ing for more than 50 percent of the Loft operations, so they need to gain governance over the actual execution of fees, ‚Äù Gupta said. ‚ÄúI would like oversight over the entire operation. ‚Äù
Under Gupta‚Äôs proposal, college 
councils and student organizations would be able to use the Loft space for free. 
A.S. Vice President of Student Life 
Riscie Hernandez opposed the over-sight amendments. 
‚Äú A.S. is not good at owning things, ‚Äù 
Hernandez said. ‚ÄúOur only experi-ence [is] in budgeting and making sure our student fees properly go toward what needs to be done. ‚Äù
Another key issue of debate sur-
rounding the proposal was whether it would be placed on the Spring Quarter A.S. elections ballot along with several other referendums or put before students Winter Quarter in the form of a special election. 
After concluding that the Loft‚Äôs 
current funding is inadequate to last the remainder of the year, the com-mittee originally voted to run the referendum Winter Quarter in order to provide the venue with additional funds by Spring Quarter 2010.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre out of money, and without 
the referendum, we can‚Äôt continue with our programming, ‚Äù he said. 
However, Gupta said running a 
Spring Quarter referendum was more appropriate. 
‚ÄúThis push for Winter Quarter 
has created a reduced schedule where we don‚Äôt have enough time to review everything, ‚Äù Gupta said. 
According to Gupta, the hours 
spent discussing the issue were inad-equate given the weight of the deci-sion. The committee met a total of three times.
‚ÄúThe special committee had 
less than half membership during its meetings and only two voting members of the council, ‚Äù Gupta said. ‚ÄúThe committee failed, and the argu-ment that it should be approved just because it went through a committee is ludicrous. ‚Äù
Taylor was disappointed at the 
decision to postpone a vote on the referendum.
‚ÄúScare tactics were used to create 
a false sense of urgency that wasn‚Äôt there, ‚Äù Taylor said. ‚ÄúWeeks of meet-ings went into this referendum and so much work on the part of individual members and UCAB. ‚Äù
Gupta said more time was needed 
to examine the referendum.
‚ÄúThere were not hours and hours 
of work put into this ‚Äî there were four or five, ‚Äù Gupta said. ‚ÄúThis post-ponement was the responsible action to take. ‚Äù
Wollesen said that Loft represen-
tatives will continue to campaign for the referendum to be on the Spring Quarter 2010 ballot.

ON CAMPUS ‚Äî At some point during the construc-
tion o
f Pepper Canyon Hall, a particularly enlightened 
group of engineers decided every student should 
have enough desk space to set up a television, two 
toaster ovens and a Stratego board. The result of their 
brave vision was Room 121 ‚Äî a shining testament to 
personal space in a world of cramped lecture halls, and 
one of the most ideal doodling locales on campus.  
When presented with a writing surface the size of a small 
raft, it becomes difficult for the habitual doodler to remain focused on the lecture at hand. The cold gray desktop becomes a vast landscape of ink-stained possibility, and absent-minded margin scribbling is transformed into an epic 50-minute parade of artistic vision. Weird-looking classmates appear as trained models, poised magnificently for renderings of their more unfortunate features ‚Äî beady eyes, big ears, tightly pursed lips.

Just remember these simple rules: 1) Don‚Äôt

long
 searched for 
a place to capture 
a perfect San Diego 
skyline shot, look no 
further than the Centennial 
Park coast in Coronado. Just northwest of the old ferry landing, you will find this irresistible view of the San Diego skyline pleading to be photographed. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre shooting with a dinky iPhone or a 5D Mark II, a snap of this skyline will make any amateur photographer look like a pro. For the best results, photograph the view about an hour after sunset. Once you finish, just post your photo on Flickr and bask in the accolades.

1936, poet/playwright Federico Garcia Lorca wrote his last play about a domineering Spanish matriarch and her Ô¨Åve adult daughters. After the death of Bernarda Alba‚Äôs second husband, she imposes a period of mourning on the girls. Repressed by their controlling mother and her fanatical tyranny of ideology, the only salvation in their otherwise intolerable lives are menial daily rituals. Under the direction of Jeffrey Wienckowski, the adaptation promises to capture Lorca‚Äôs avant-gardism through a surrealist lens. (JB) THE HOUSE OF BERNARDA ALBA

Inspired by the true tale of Michael 
Oher (newcomer Quintin Aaron), ‚ÄúThe Blind Side‚Äù follows the 
assumedly toughing saga of an impov-
erished black  kid adopted by ‚Äúkind 
Christian white-folk, ‚Äù giving him 
the opportunity to become a college 
football phenom. The synopsis itself should be enough to derail you ‚Äî but we shall continue.
Leigh Anne Touhy (Sandra 
Bullock) plays the Southern belle  who 
invites poor Oher into her home ‚Äî a Kathy Lee Gifford clone complete with 
an ear-wrenching Southern accent. 
Touhy‚Äôs rather bland family is com-posed of her husband (the typecast  Tim McGraw), their underwhelming not-quite-bitchy-enough daughter Collins and son SJ ‚Äî the less cute and more annoying version of the kid from ‚ÄúJerry Maguire. ‚Äù 
‚ÄúSide‚Äù is predictable and rife with 
uninspired dialogue, but the great-est distraction lies in the fact that the characters, who are supposed to mir-
ror their real-life counterparts, are free 
of flaw. In fact, it isn‚Äôt until a vomitous photomontage over the end credits that the audience is reminded that director John Lee Hancock‚Äôs film is based on actual events. Because the script doesn‚Äôt manage any 
engaging conflicts

It‚Äôs difficult to determine what to make of Aaron as an actor at first, as his character doesn‚Äôt speak and his face bears little emotion. Then he starts talking ‚Äî and all remaining hopes are dashed.
T o whom is this supposed to 
appeal? Has Hollywood not pro-duced enough inspirational under-dog football flicks with subtle racial tension? We all saw ‚ÄúRemember The Titans, ‚Äù liked it well enough and wish to never see it reenacted again.
Although its underlying story is technically uplifting, the film paints every issue as black vs. white, conse-quently coming off as condescending and racist. Heightened melodrama takes itself too seriously, never paus-ing long enough to have real emo-tional impact ‚Äî and with maudlin, score-driven scenes orchestrated to draw out phony feelings, it‚Äôs almost hard not to feel used.
The film only gets interesting in 
the few moments that Michael reenters the ghetto in search of his crack-head mother. Sadly, the rest of the plot takes place inside a golden-gated, pale-skinned dream home, as Oher is invit-ed in one day and magically adopted the next. From there, Hancock forces us to sit through what feels like an entire football game of monotonous play-by-plays and southern drawl.

ISLAND DEF JAM3

Freakishly mellow songwriter Norah Jones‚Äô fourth album, The Fall , is lovely and cohesive: Lyrics are intelligent every 
time, Norah‚Äôs voice is rich and pure every time and the 
guitar part is catchy every time. And I do mean every time. Over and over again.
Lead single ‚ÄúChasing Pirates‚Äù is built off a repetitive 
bassline, lighthearted and somewhat salsa-inspired. Pair with a stock drumbeat and Norah‚Äôs honeyed vocals, it‚Äôs ostensibly a slow-paced, tender love song. But it‚Äôs hard to be sure. I might have gotten it confused with the 12 other cuts on the album, almost all of which rely on a simple bass rhythm, sparse drumbeat and soulful lyrics in identical dul-cet tones. 
Taken separately, each track is well crafted and easy on the 
ears. Combined, they blend into an hour of numbing lounge beats that increasingly resemble the type of tin you ignore in line at Starbucks.
Come to think of it, that might be what Jones was going for. ‚ÄúY oung Blood‚Äù breaks from the languid, yearning tones 
mold; a quickening and evocative storyline about a vampire (what else?) promises intense build-up, but just when we 
crave a full, throaty chorus, the track falls back to its original speed and starts to blend into the surrounding sea of mass-produced love songs.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Gonna Be‚Äù is the breakout star, by sheer dint of being 
the most memorable. Here, that hesitant bass finally fleshes out and comes into its own, the beat deep and insistent a la ‚ÄúSeven Nation Army. ‚Äù Norah‚Äôs voice turns the charcoal kind of smoky and swells in attitude, dragged yowling up and down the scale by a zippety piano, gauzy wall-of-sound guitar and drum that finally drills past our earlobes. 
The Fall is an atmospheric LP for a cozy night at home. 
Put it on as background for higher thoughts, and enjoy like you would a fuzzy Target blanket.

If you get a patriotic buzz from Budweiser commer-cials, you‚Äôll love Bon Jovi‚Äôs The Circle . 
The all-out gutsy battle cries from a hard-luck 
working-class hero ‚Äî over a token arena-rock chorus ‚Äî is all still here, frozen in time like a long-forgotten TV dinner. The hard edge of defiance Bon Jovi toyed with in high-school hit ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs My Life‚Äù is gone, sacri-ficed in a vain attempt to make good on their pop-metal roots. Break out the chiseled jaws and disaffect-ed stares, ‚Äô cause it‚Äôs time for dude to go hardscrabble like only a multimillionaire can.
First single ‚ÄúWe Weren‚Äôt Born to Follow‚Äù has 
‚Äî surprise, surprise ‚Äî Jon Bon Jovi singing about the perseverance of the blue-collars. (Because he‚Äôs one of them, of course). Additional props to good ole American boy Tico Torres, who plays a no-frills and no-talent drum pattern all through Circle . It‚Äôs a 
romp through middle America in all its bland glory, complete with ‚ÄúLive Before Y ou Die‚Äù ‚Äî a better-days power ballad ‚Äî and brilliantly named ‚ÄúFast Cars, ‚Äù a tribute to fellow generation geniuses Coldplay.
Circle  takes a much needed violent turn on the 
fifth track ‚ÄúBullet. ‚Äù Sure, the chorus is made of the same overblown Nickelback pomposity, but with the edgy frustration that made ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs My Life‚Äù so appealing to the kiddes (choppy guitars, driving rhythm from Torres), it‚Äôs the first track we can rock out to without making sure no one‚Äôs looking.
Of course, it‚Äôs then back to perfect replicas of big-
hair hits, but without any of the fun. Sure, when ‚ÄúLivin‚Äô on a Prayer‚Äù comes on, everyone‚Äôs going to yell them-selves hoarse through the chorus ‚Äî but if Jon tries to crowd surf to the latest singles, he‚Äôs going to be eating a buttload of trampled water bottles.

hit Tokyo, Japan, and Osaka, Japan, and Bali. G: How were the shows out of the 
country?H: The shows out of the country are 
beautiful, and they‚Äôre so different from anything we‚Äôre used to experiencing. The cultures are so different, so the way that they react to our music and the way they interpret our music ‚Äî the way that they even move to our music ‚Äî is completely different. It‚Äôs great to see how other cultures inter-pret what we do.G: So you guys just dropped Day 
after Forever in September, five years after your previous release Earthtones . 
When did you guys start working on this project and what was going on in the time in between? H: The record is Day After Forever,  
and it‚Äôs in keeping with the idea that it took so long to make this damn record. We‚Äôve been working on this for a while, off and on, and also we‚Äôve been doing a whole bunch of projects. It‚Äôs taken a while just because we‚Äôve been doing a whole lot of experiment-ing and kind of just settled back on doing what it is that we wanted to do. We really wanted to make a timeless record. And I think in the end, we kind of persevered through it and got the songs that made for a solid album. G: Since you guys are a hip-hop band, 
you probably hear a lot of compari-sons between you and the Roots ‚Äî obviously a really famous hip-hop band. What do you think about that comparison?H: First off, we all in the band love 
the Roots, and the Roots are insanely fresh. I think it‚Äôs not like we draw specific inspiration from the Roots any more than we would A Tribe Called Quest or Kanye West or Jay-Z ‚Äî it just so happens that they play live instruments. I think we have a pretty original take on stay-ing as an organic, live hip-hop band. We‚Äôre definitely not going for trying to be another version of the Roots, because they did it ‚Äî they did it perfect, and they continue to do the Roots sound really well. We‚Äôre defi-nitely not trying to step on any toes, you know?G: A couple years ago, you guys actu-
ally played at the pub on our campus on 4/20. Do you guys remember any-thing about the show at all? R: Wait, wait, wait‚Ä¶ How does that 
room look? Is that, um‚Ä¶G: It‚Äôs kinda like this dark, grungy 
place.R: Is it rectangular?
G: Sorry, what?R: Is it rectangular? G: Uhhh‚Ä¶
H: Wait, is that the show with 
Persephone‚Äôs Bees? G: Y eah, they played after you.
H: That was a dope show.
R: Oh, yeah! 
H: There were several dope bands that 
night. But no, that was a great show. That was definitely fun ‚Äî the crowd was really live and you know, 4/20.G: Did you get to celebrate with any of 
the students afterwards?
H: I think some of us did, definitely 
(laughs). 
R: The students down there love to get down and have a good time. That‚Äôs why I love coming down there. Everyone‚Äôs so ready for it. Some places you go, it‚Äôs like you really have to really, really fight to get everyone into it and involved. But I just remember everyone ready. Soon as we hit the stage it was like, aight, cool, let‚Äôs go. Y ou know ‚Äî let‚Äôs freakin‚Äô party in here.G: I had a question for Raashan. So 
last week, we had UCSD‚Äôs first-ever freestyle emcee battle on campus. R: Y ee-ah.
G: I was wondering if you remember 
your first battle, and what it was like for you?R: Y eah, dang, my first battle‚Ä¶
G: Or any memorable one?
R: If I had to choose my most 
memorable battle, it was when I met the original member of Crown City Rockers ‚Äî we used to be called Mission. I actually met him in Boston, on the street. I moved from Pasadena, and the night before, I met some emcees and I was freestyling with them. They told this guy Moe Pope that there was an emcee from Cali that was pretty dope and I met him on the street and he was like, ‚ÄúY o, I heard you was dope. ‚Äù I was like, ‚ÄúY eah, you know, I‚Äôm cool. ‚Äù He was like, ‚ÄúWanna battle?‚Äù (laughs). I was like, ‚ÄúY eah. ‚Äù So we just started battling, right there on the streets in Boston. And I remember there was snow on the ground, and I wasn‚Äôt used to snow. And like, the dude was so ill ‚Äî we just went back and forth, back and forth, and later we shook hands and we became a crew after that. Which is how I met Crown City Rockers: off of that battle with Moe Pope. G: I‚Äôve seen you guys live before and, 
to say the least, it wasn‚Äôt what you would expect from an average hip-hop show. What would you tell people to expect from a live Crown City show? H: Expect the unexpected. Oooooh 
(laughs). It‚Äôs a party. Like I was saying, if you listen to the record, there‚Äôs a lot of different kinds of moods. A little bit of party stuff and also some introspec-tive mellow music, and I think when we do it live, we really try to blend what we do on record and a posi-tive approach to making music, and mix that with keeping it very much a party. It‚Äôs not gonna be a snoozefest. It‚Äôs definitely some rip-roarious stuff musically, and definitely some fantas-tic vocalizations by the man Raashan Ahmad. G: I think that covers everything. Is 
there anything else you guys want to add?
H: Check out the Day After Forever  
by Crown City Rockers, and get it any 
way that you need to get it. If you can spring the 10 to 15 bucks to buy it, then you‚Äôre on our Christmas-card list forever. We really appreciate the sup-port and need the support, and if for some reason you can‚Äôt spring for it, get it off the Internet, get it from a homie, spread the word and tell a friend.
R: Come to the show. Buy a T-shirt. 
Be on the team. 
Crown City Rockers will perform at the 
Loft with Afterschoolspecial and Mike Gao on Nov. 20 at 9 p.m.

3418 THE UCSD GUARDIAN  THURSDAY , NOVEMBER 19, 2009  SPORTS
standing taller than 6-feet-4 inches ‚Äî 
a huge size disadvantage against the menacing Aztec frontcourt. However, the Tritons stayed aggressive on defense and attacked the boards, lim-iting SDSU to only five second-chance points in the first half.
Trailing by as many as eight points 
in the first quarter, UCSD took advan-tage of their deep bench and capital-ized on opportunities under the basket to inch back into the game. A runner from senior guard Tyler Acevedo cut the Aztec‚Äôs lead to one with only 7:31 remaining in the first half. Acevedo then tied the game just over a minute later, hitting a three-pointer off an assist from junior guard Casey Ryan after a turnover by Aztec guard D.J. Gay.
Both teams remained scoreless for 
nearly three minutes before junior forward Malcolm Thomas converted a fast-break layup opportunity for San Diego State with 3:45 remaining in the half. The Tritons didn‚Äôt score again until there was 2:23 left in the half, when sophomore forward Scott Krizman converted UCSD‚Äôs only two free-throw opportunities of the first half. 
UCSD tied the game again at 1:16 
after junior center Andrew Browning put back Krizman‚Äôs missed jumper, and Ryan followed Acevedo‚Äôs steal with a jumper of his own. Coming out of a timeout tied at 28 ‚Äî with 51.6 seconds left before intermission ‚Äî Krizman was called for a foul on a defensive rebound attempt, and Thomas hit one of two from the line for the Aztecs. Thomas then recorded a steal and a quick layup to push the home lead back to three. 
The Tritons had the last shot 
opportunity of the half, but Acevedo missed a potential game-tying three-pointer and UCSD headed to the lock-er room down 31-28.
San Diego State scored 17 unan-
swered points to open the second half while the Tritons missed their first 13 shots attempts. UCSD made six of their next seven shots from the field ‚Äî three by senior guard Jordan Lawley ‚Äî but the Aztecs maintained their advantage. San Diego State led by as much as 25 down the stretch and held on for the win, improving to 11-0 all-time against UCSD.
‚Äú[We] definitely had some strong 
points early on, but toward the end after halftime I thought we fell off a little bit, ‚Äù Acevedo said. ‚ÄúThe intensity in the first five minutes was pivotal, and we didn‚Äôt match their intensity. ‚ÄùThe Aztecs ‚Äî winning a record 
26 games last season and trying for a fifth-straight postseason berth ‚Äî beat UCSD despite the absence of their top returning scorer, Billy White. 
‚ÄúWe competed for a half; I thought 
we did some good things, ‚Äù Carlson said. ‚ÄúI thought we took way too many [three-pointers]. We settled a lot for stuff in the perimeter. When we attacked the basket, we got some good results. I thought we got better today. That‚Äôs one of the things I was really looking to see ‚Äî whether we competed. ‚Äù
Acevedo led the way for UCSD in 
the exhibition loss, sinking 14 points in 24 minutes off the bench. Ryan recorded team highs of eight rebounds and four assists along with scoring 
eight points. Lawley was UCSD‚Äôs sec-ond leading scorer, putting up nine points. Freshman Justin Brue made a strong debut for the Tritons, scoring six points and grabbing three boards.
‚ÄúWe really got to get after it, because 
now we‚Äôre out of the exhibition season and now we‚Äôre into non-conference, ‚Äù Acevedo said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre growing as the season goes along, and today was a big learning curve. ‚Äù
UCSD will head to Pueblo, Co. for 
their first regular-season game of the year, taking on Western State College o n  N o v .  2 0  a s  p a r t  o f  t h e  A l  K a l y  Classic.

ers having to take on new roles¬† or expanding their existing ones, ‚Äù said head coach Charity Elliot, entering her third season with the Tritons. 
‚ÄúFortunately, we have great experi-
ence returning in the backcourt. [Our returners] have done a great job of leading by example, vocally commu-nicating to our new players what our expectations are and setting the stan-dard for our work ethic. ‚Äù
According to Elliott, the absence 
of Osier and Gaskin presents the team with an opportunity to make positive changes. 
 ‚ÄúI really like how our team is devel-
oping so far, ‚Äù Elliott said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got three very talented freshmen and three transfers who have all done a great job of learning our system. I think we have a team of players who are willing to step up and do their part. ‚Äù
Earlier this month, Elliott‚Äôs squad 
was put to its first test during an exhi-bition match against national power-house and premier Division-I program 
Stanford University. Squaring off on 
Nov. 8, UCSD lost in a lopsided 107-55 game to the Cardinal ‚Äî who shot 58.3 percent from the floor.
UCSD, meanwhile, shot 42.4 per-
cent in the first period but struggled offensively during the second half, hit-ting just nine of 43 attempts. At half-time, UCSD trailed 56-34. Stanford‚Äôs size and strength proved a challenge for the Tritons, and the Cardinal pulled away in the second half, hitting the century mark with 4:12 left to play.
Carlisle led the Tritons with 20 
points, hauling in five boards and a pair of assists. Ilg was the only other player to reach double figures for the Tritons, totaling 15 points and going seven for 14 from the floor. 
‚ÄúHaving the opportunity to play at 
Stanford was a tremendous experience for our team, ‚Äù Elliot said. ‚ÄúWe were able to play against one of the best teams in the country and have some small successes. ‚Äù 
UCSD‚Äôs second exhibition game 
against University of San Diego on Nov. 14 was a much closer contest, but the Tritons ultimately lost 88-69. 
Starting strong on offense, UCSD 
took a 13-0 lead four minutes into the first half. Five different players con-tributed to the team‚Äôs solid start, led by 
Carlisle and sophomore guard Daisy 
Feder, who each hit three-pointers.
But the lead was short-lived: The 
Toreros responded with a 16-3 run that tied the game at 19-19. 
USD went on to outscore the 
Tritons the rest of the stretch, con-verting 30 of 53 shots to seal the win. UCSD shot just under 38 percent from the floor.
‚ÄúBoth teams were able to really 
show us what our weaknesses are, ‚Äù Elliott said about the preseason. ‚ÄúNow, it‚Äôs time for the [regular] season to 
start, and we are thrilled. We‚Äôve got a team of hard workers, overachievers and very talented basketball players. It may take us a little while to figure out our roles, but I think we will be much deeper and well-rounded  than we have 
been in the past. ‚Äù 
 In the game against the Toreros, 
Carlisle again led the team with a game-high 21 points. Ilg was three-for-five from three-point range, and contributed 10 points. 
‚ÄúWe have taken a lot away from 
our first two exhibition losses, ‚Äù Ilg said. ‚ÄúStanford showed us we need to work on our defensive transition and our alertness on defense. USD showed us that mental errors or lapses in effort ‚Äî even for a minute ‚Äî can change the momentum of the game. ‚Äù
For a Triton squad with high 
expectations for the upcoming cam-paign, a challenging first two games helped players prepare for the start of 
the regular season.
‚ÄúThese games also showed us 
our strengths: our half-court offense, 
half-court defense and our speed, ‚Äù Ilg said. ‚ÄúBoth of these games were great learning experiences. By game time on Saturday, we will be a different team and ready to start this season. This team has incredible potential, and we can‚Äôt wait for it all to begin. ‚Äù

Mulloy won the second set 7-6 and finished off with a 6-3 third-set vic-tory to finally seal the win ‚Äî which took three hours and 30 minutes to land.
‚ÄúI felt pretty good at 
the invitational, ‚Äù sopho-more Katie Mulloy said. ‚ÄúI had a tough match on Saturday. We need to continue to practice matches, and to make the right shot selection and the right returns for spring. ‚Äù
Pourmirzaie kept 
up her dominant play, earning a second-straight victory at the invitational by defeating Irvine‚Äôs Ali Murphy in a close 7-5, 7-6 deci-sion.

Along with Davis and Breisacher‚Äôs 
doubles victory, Bains and Athavale lost 8-3 to a pair from Irvine, and Tang and Dao narrowly lost 8-6 to a Riverside duo.
‚ÄúI think it was a great experience 
for us, ‚Äù head coach Liz LaPlante said. ‚ÄúWe came up against very strong Division-I competitors. I think we performed really well. The invita-tional gave us indication where to make changes. Our goal for spring is to win our conference. We would like to continue our streak. ‚Äù

the current Division-II record in the 500-meter freestyle event with a winning time of 4:59.00. UCSD was also boosted by a trio of underclass-man swimmers: Freshman Bethany Dong and sophomores Natasha Nguyen and Megan Thomas placed second, fourth and fifth respectively.
‚ÄúThe distance athletes did an 
exceptional job this weekend, ‚Äù McGihon said. ‚ÄúIn terms of our mid-distance programs, we are in an up year. We‚Äôre getting better, and confidence level is rising with the more races we swim. ‚Äù
McGihon knows the team will 
need confidence heading into the team‚Äôs next meet: the highly com-petitive Toshiba Classic. Hosted by UCSD but held in Long Beach, 
Calif., the three-day meet will begin 
on Nov. 19 and feature some of the highest-caliber swim programs on the West Coast.
‚ÄúWith the likes of Berkeley and 
Stanford competing, we‚Äôll definitely see some high-level swimming, ‚Äù McGihon said. 
On the men‚Äôs side, the Tritons 
will compete against 13 teams, including the Stanford men‚Äôs team, which finished third at last year‚Äôs Division-I National Championships. Additionally, UCSD will face Pacific Collegiate Swimming Conference rivals Cal Baptist University, Chapman University, Soka University of America and Seattle University.
The women‚Äôs competitors are no 
less daunting. The Triton swimmers will be competing in a field of 26 dif-ferent teams, highlighted by defend-ing national champion UC Berkeley and several perennial top-50 pro-grams like Stanford, Hawaii and UCLA. UCSD‚Äôs in-conference rivals Cal Baptist, Chapman, Soka, Alaska 
Fairbanks, Loyola Marymount and 
Pepperdine will also be competing at the Classic. 
Coming into the Toshiba Classic, 
the Triton men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs teams boast impressive season records to date, and collectively hold seven top times across the Division-II nation-al level.
McGihon said he views this 
upcoming meet as yet anoth-er opportunity for the Tritons to improve. 
‚ÄúWe want to be swimming 
against the best teams and best indi-viduals as much as we can, so we can swim our best now ‚Ä¶ and toward the end of the season, ‚Äù McGihon said. ‚ÄúSwimming against the high-est level of competition will help us reach those goals. ‚Äù
Barnett-Woods echoed his 
coach‚Äôs sentiment, saying he had high expectations for himself and his teammates coming into the Toshiba Classic.
‚ÄúI expect most of the team to be 
at or [setting their] personal best times, ‚Äù Barnett-Woods said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm expecting myself to beat my times 
and make the NCAA A-Cup. Since 
we have such strong competition like Stanford and Cal, it will help us push ourselves to be our best. ‚Äù
The Tritons look to continue 
the pursuit of personal records and team success against the likes of Stanford and Cal in the Toshiba Classic from Nov. 19 to Nov. 21 at the Belmont Plaza Olympic Pool in 
Long Beach, Calif.

WOMEN‚ÄôS TENNIS ‚Äî The UCSD  
women‚Äôs tennis team road-tripped 
to the UC Irvine Fall Invitational on Nov. 13 for its last competition of the fall season. The Tritons played well in one of fall‚Äôs toughest competitions, and saw a couple of players pick up respectable seventh-place finishes. The  tournament featured teams 
from Loyola Marymount University, the University of Montana, Santa Clara University, UC Irvine and UC Riverside.
The Tritons‚Äô lone victory came 
on the first day of the Invitational, as junior Roxanna Pourmirzaie defeat-ed Riverside‚Äôs Ayana Simmons 6-2, 6-4. Pourmirzaie came out of last spring‚Äôs season with a strong 8-2 record in singles play, and held up her stellar reputation at the Irvine tournament.
One of the closest matches of 
the day was between UCSD senior Anita Athavale and Irvine junior Miranda Y oung. Y oung narrowly defeated Athavale 6-2, 7-6 in a mara-thon match. UCSD sophomore Katie Mulloy faced Riverside‚Äôs Angelique Corpuz in another grueling battle, but was ultimately defeated 6-4, 6-2. In the other singles matches on Friday, UCSD juniors  Taskeen Bains, 
Cindy Dao and Valerie Tang faced heavy challenges from Irvine‚Äôs No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 singles competitors. Despite losing each of their respec-tive matches, the Triton trio took a total of five games from their Irvine opponents.
In Friday‚Äôs doubles play, Bains 
and Athavale lost 8-2 to the Loyola Marymount duo of Jasmin Heckel and Elisaveta Pironkov. Similarly, Tang and Dao were edged out 8-6 by Riverside‚Äôs Corpuz and Taylor Raney.

SWIMMING & DIVING ‚Äî The 
UCSD swimming and diving teams 
fell to UC Santa Barbara on Nov. 13 in a highly competitive away meet where the Triton men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs teams lost 155-96 and 144-112, respectively.
The meet marked a distinct 
improvement from last year‚Äôs com-petition at Santa Barbara, where the Tritons‚Äô Division-I opponents cruised to crushing 177.5-75.5 and 152-109 victories. 
‚ÄúWe have made really good 
strides in terms of comparing the two programs, ‚Äù head coach Scott McGihon said. ‚ÄúThis year, the gap was narrowed considerably and the results demonstrated that. ‚Äù
In particular ‚Äî on both the men‚Äôs 
and women‚Äôs side ‚Äî the Tritons were buoyed by the strong perfor-mance of their distance swimmers. For the men, senior Jereme Barnett-Woods won the 1,000-meter free-style event with a time of 9:42:84, and placed second in the 500-meter freestyle heat with a time of 4:42.33.
His results are the latest in a 
string of impressive times for Barnett-Woods ‚Äî a transfer from the University of Washington ‚Äî whose time of 9:35.43 in the 1,000-meter freestyle event against Texas Christian University on Nov. 6 ranks him No. 2 at the Division-II national level.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm very pleased with my results 
so far, ‚Äù Barnett-Woods said. ‚ÄúThe 9:35:43 time and the 1,000 freestyle are my season bests. UCSB is a D-I school; they are tough to compete with, and I think we did a good job. ‚Äù
The Triton women were equally 
dominant in their distance events, as sophomore Alex Henley broke

As the UCSD women‚Äôs basketball team prepares to open their regu-lar season this weekend at Grand 
Canyon University, there‚Äôs excitement in the air. 
This year‚Äôs squad boasts six new faces 
and welcomes back three starters from the 2008-09 season. 
‚ÄúWe are a completely new team, and I‚Äôm 
excited to see what we can do, ‚Äù senior for-ward Erin Noonan said. ‚ÄúEveryone on our 
team can come in, make a huge contribution 
and keep the same energy up on the floor from the starting group. ‚Äù
Absent from this year‚Äôs squad are former  
center Alexis Gaskin and former forward Michelle Osier, two of the team‚Äôs leading scorers last season. Head coach Charity Elliot said she feels that this year‚Äôs team will have little trouble in making up for last year‚Äôs graduated seniors.

Michelle Osier and Alexis Gaskin‚Äôs caliber, there is going to be a process of other play-See TENNIS page 19 See SWIVE  page 19
