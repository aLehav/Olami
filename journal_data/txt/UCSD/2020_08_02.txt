More than any other professional American sports league, Major League Baseball has
completely botched its restart. Since much of the country shut down in March amid the
pandemic’s early stages in the United States, we’ve watched baseball consistently lag behind
the rest of the major sports. As contract disputesTo learn more about The UCSD Guardian's coverage of the COVID-19

(https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/05/28/sports/inside-multibillion-dollar-dispute-
between-mlb-its-players/) amongst millionaires and billionaires left behind the minor
leaguers and stadium staff from popular discourse, the sport looked to be racked with
disunity and potentially looking to skip the 2020 season.
Maybe it should have.
As preseason concerns surrounding player health and safety were quelled during the summer
camp or “Spring Training 2.0” in late June and early July, problems remained. Even
disregarding the concerns surrounding prioritizing players for tests during a time when most
Americans struggle to get tests, let alone one- or two-day turnarounds on test results, the
restart process teetered on the line between morality and profiteering.
Now, after less than one week of games, all of the problems of playing sports during a
pandemic have reared their ugly heads.
Most glaringly, players have been getting sick, and there does not seem to be a clear and
complete plan in place for when that happens, despite an expanded operations manual with
more than 100 pages of seemingly meticulous planning
(https://www.si.com/mlb/2020/06/26/mlb-season-2020-operations-manual-changes)
coming from MLB before the season began. A few hours before Dr. Anthony Fauci spiked the
first pitch (https://www.mlb.com/video/fauci-throws-first-pitch-of-2020) on Opening Day
at Nationals Park in Washington D.C., the best player on the defending champion Nationals,
21-year-old Juan Soto, was scratched from the lineup
(https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/07/24/juan-soto-coronavirus-test-
nationals-season/). He’d tested positive for COVID-19 and was entering the mandatory
quarantine, where he’s set to remain until he tests negative twice in 24 hours.
Should that game against the New York Yankees have even happened? Soto testing positive
means other players certainly could have been exposed, right? Apparently not, and the game
went on as planned without any more major hitches. That is, until lightning and torrential
rain cut the game off at the knees in the fifth inning. 
From then on, concerns surrounding COVID-19 came up only sparingly during broadcasts
and media coverage. Three more full days passed before pandemic panic recaptured the news
cycle on Monday, during which time things began to feel more like normal. I could talk to myAccessed: 7/31/2020 Hey Baseball, Get Your Act Together and Pause the Season
grandpa and dad about the Los Angeles Dodgers and could constantly text with my fantasy
baseball league about players and games for the first time since we canceled our annual draft
in March.
But now, players are getting sick even more often than they did at the beginning of summer
camp, when players were being tested after spending months without any strict team-
enforced guidelines at home. 
As of Monday afternoon, two MLB games have already been postponed due to COVID-19
concerns after more than half of the Miami Marlins traveling party, which includes players
and coaches, have reportedly tested positive (https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/27/us/miami-
marlins-coronavirus/index.html). They’ve postponed their game with the Baltimore Orioles
on Monday and Tuesday and are sequestered in Philadelphia awaiting the results of a
reactionary round of testing. 
Their most recent opponent, the Philadelphia Phillies, postponed their game with the
Yankees to ensure the visitor’s clubhouse, which the Marlins occupied less than 12 hours
prior, has time to be fully “fumigated
(https://twitter.com/JonHeyman/status/1287746559820668928)” to disinfect any
potentially contaminated surfaces.
This news came in just as reports of a potential pair of cases for the Cincinnati Reds’ Mike
Moustakas and Nic Senzel made its way into headlines. Both reportedly
(https://sports.yahoo.com/reds-moustakas-senzel-sick-teammate-tests-positive-201131932-
-mlb.html) were not feeling well as of Sunday and a teammate, Matt Davidson, tested
positive days earlier. MLB did not postpone that game however, but thankfully a downpour
stepped in (https://www.bleachernation.com/cubs/2020/07/27/after-discussion-with-reds-
and-moustakas-to-the-il-david-ross-cubs-feel-its-safe-to-play-tonight/)  once again to save
the day … until the game started a few hours later. If rain can delay a game and push it to a
later date this season, as it did Monday in Cleveland
(https://www.cleveland.com/tribe/2020/07/cleveland-indians-white-sox-will-play-
traditional-doubleheader-tuesday-after-mondays-postponement.html) , shouldn’t games be
delayed for test results to avoid more outbreaks? And if you can push the entire season back
from March to July, couldn’t the entire league pause for a day or two? And how is this even a
question I need to ask?Accessed: 7/31/2020 Hey Baseball, Get Your Act Together and Pause the Season
Fans were prepared for this — or at least they should have been. There was always the
possibility that having sports during a pandemic would not work. And for the more astute
observers, the lofty plans to protect players seemed destined to fail even after watching the
first few two games of the new season on Thursday.
Broadcasters and viewers alike noted just how many protocol violations there were during
each game. High fives and spitting, two of the major prohibited actions within MLB’s 2020
protocol, were decreased compared to a normal game, but many players were caught on
camera doing both over the season’s opening weekend. Players and coaches often failed to
wear masks inside of the dugout. And most glaringly perhaps, even umpires, the
professionals selected to ensure players and coaches adhere to the rules of the game to
uphold their own safety, failed to follow the rules. 
In an afternoon matchup between the St. Louis Cardinals and Pittsburgh Pirates on Saturday,
July 25, tempers flared and after a player was ejected, an argument ensued between Pirates
manager Derek Shelton and home plate umpire Jordan Baker
(https://www.mlb.com/pirates/news/derek-holland-ejected-from-pirates-game) . Shelton
had a cloth mask and Baker stored a surgical mask in his pocket. After struggling to put on
his clearly broken mask (https://twitter.com/Jomboy_/status/1287830359464464390?
ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) before confronting
Shelton, Baker took the mask off his face during an especially heated portion of the
encounter. Then Shelton’s mask slipped off his nose, exposing his nose and mouth
(https://twitter.com/Jomboy_/status/1287830359464464390?
ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet). After both readjusted
their masks after exchanging a few more words, Baker walked away. A few moments later, he
returned to further discuss with Shelton and when he realized his mask was back in his
pocket, he took off his cap and held it over his mouth. 
Come on guys. If we are going to bring back baseball for all of the economic, entertainment,
and frankly mental-health benefits it can provide, the rules must be  followed, and that goes
for the players as well. These rules were not put in place arbitrarily. They are meant to limit
the chances of spreading COVID-19 during events that would not normally be sanctioned in
many cities. Without following the rules, it should come as no surprise that players and
coaches are getting sick, which is exactly why players and fans were worried about restarting
the season in the first place. If players are going to continue to play games this season, they
must follow the rules they agreed upon and be ready to face consequences when they fail to
do so.Accessed: 7/31/2020 Hey Baseball, Get Your Act Together and Pause the Season
The NBA has successfully punished players for violating protocol
(https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2020-07-26/clippers-lou-williams-10-day-
quarantine-miss-games); why can’t baseball do the same to protect its players and season?
Maybe too many players and really entire teams are not following protocol, and so MLB may
feel they cannot effectively enforce rules for an entire team of delinquent players and
coaches? This could certainly be the case. The NBA had already begun punishing players
even before they’d played scrimmage games. In contrast, MLB teams played their televised
intersquad and scrimmage games and despite having players breaking the rules at seemingly
every turn, there was little to be heard from the league.
This really isn’t even solely a player health issue, it is a public health problem. For every five
professional ballplayers high fiving and chatting without masks on TV, you can bet fans
around the country relaxed their own “protocols” as well. If my idols aren’t wearing masks or
doing their utmost to avoid exposure, then I must not need to either, right? Certainly, some
fans must have made that connection and that cannot be perpetuated. 
Now that a few games have been postponed, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred and the rest of
the league must come together and  pause the season to reinforce the necessity of
following protocols. Let players know that if there is a violation in the games following the
pause, there will be a consequential punishment that will actually be enforced. Playing a
season that should only have been played under the protocols’ guidelines without adhering to
those guidelines should not be permitted. It will injure players, coaches, staff, and their
families, not to mention send mixed signals to the fans that need the game almost as much as
the players.
I’m one of the fans who’s been watching games all weekend long, whenever I could. But I
didn’t just watch for fun to escape the pandemic and all of its stress. I watched because I was
worried that baseball, like so many individuals around the country, would not do all they
could to keep COVID-19 at bay. Sadly, watching a few hours of baseball confirmed those
fears. 
I’m a huge baseball fan. I love MLB and so much of what it does for its players, its fans, and
its communities has been beneficial, especially in recent years. But now, that love is starting
to fade. Owners are failing to pay minor league players
(https://www.npr.org/2020/05/27/863422729/oakland-as-to-stop-paying-minor-league-

inability to enforce the protocol they put in place to protect their players have jeopardized the
very game they profit off of.
I’ve followed quarantining rules to the letter; I’ve seen friends in a socially distanced manner
roughly once a month since mid-March. Baseball provides a new distraction and a valuable
source for friends to talk about. My virtual fantasy baseball draft we conducted over Zoom
was quite literally the best day of my year to this point in 2020 and having more baseball will
certainly continue to make millions of lives better, even in some small way. Please baseball,
get it right, for all of us.

There is nothing more refreshing than a show displaying women taking over a male-
dominated pastime.To learn more about The UCSD Guardian's coverage of the COVID-19
pandemic, click here →  (https://ucsdguardian.org/tag/covid-19/)Accessed: 7/31/2020 TV Review: "Betty" - UCSD Guardian
At the beginning of the summer, HBO released “Betty,” a new television series about a group
of women trying to break into the male-dominated world of skate culture in New York City.
Crystal Moselle discovered Kirt (Nina Moran) and Camille (Rachelle Vinberg) while riding
the public transport in NYC. Moselle asked the girls for their “story,” eventually launching
the development of  “Miu Miu Women’s Tales #12,” a short film following Vinberg’s break
into the skate scene. Soon after came “Skate Kitchen,” a full length film of Vinberg’s tale, and
then finally “Betty.” 
The show’s name, “Betty,” comes from a popular derogatory term used by male skaters to put
down female skaters, and the content of the show is based on the actual experiences of these
women in their New York skateboarding group called The Skate Kitchen. The Skate Kitchen
received its name from the women of NYC skating culture as an act of reclaiming the
derogatory phrase “go back to the kitchen.” This third development of the Skate Kitchen
world by Moselle takes a deeper look into more diverse storylines of the many different
women of skate culture.
Moselle revolves the plot of the show around a group of diverse women who are equally as
talented as the heroine: Kirt, Indigo, Honeybear, Janay, Camille, and more. Each woman
within the show is made to highlight a specific aspect of the myriad of different reactions a
woman trying to break into the skate world experiences. Not only this, but the show also
includes the diverse issues that women face day to day, such as sexual abuse and
discrimination. Moselle easily weaves these complex issues into the plot, flawlessly writing in
topics such as sexuality as a spectrum, police brutality and abuse, the drug world and its
intersectionality with New York culture, and racial privilege and how that affects
relationships. While providing a personal look into the true nature of NYC life, “Betty” also
unveils many hardships that usually do not find themselves displayed in modern television.
The content of “Betty” is not the only major drawing point for the show; the fashion and
costume design breaks traditional costuming and gives an inside look into the streetwear of
NYC life. Most of the outfits the girls of “Betty” adorn straddle the line between masculinity
and femininity. From baggy pants and Nike’s one day to crop tops and skirts another, these
women break the societal standards of ‘appropriate’ clothing choices. With the additive of
bright colors and mixed textures and patterns, the clothing design captures the eyes.
“Betty” features a full cast of Instagram models who live and experience the New York skate
scene everyday. With this comes authenticity of the content of the show, and also acting that
wouldn’t be considered completely flawless. These women act as if they are talking to their
friends, complete with awkward pauses or phrasing while conversing. Where some peopleAccessed: 7/31/2020 TV Review: "Betty" - UCSD Guardian
might find this aspect of the show frustrating to watch, others see it as a refreshing display of
character and reality within a show that is written, casted, and produced. These women are
living the written plot, and deliver it the way they would within their actual lives. The acting
grounds the show in reality, making the plot and characters more relatable and obtainable to
the audience.
“Betty” is a new look into the traditionally male-dominated skateboarding world. With
inclusionary content, unapologetic displays of difficult-to-navigate issues, and creative
costume design, “Betty” is for anyone who is bored of the mainstream plethora of shows and
ready for a show that truly tests the status quo.

The new account mirrors the previous one and has continued to use misleading quotes and
insulting memes. By drawing on information from the far-right website Breitbart and
conserative political commentator Candace Owens, the account attempts to spread hateful
messages targeted at African Americans and other minorities.
In response to the original Instagram account, both UCSD administrators and Associated
Students released separate statements on July 27 and 28, respectively. AS has stated

interested in combating anti-blackness. The AS Office of External Affairs has stated that they

“We firmly denounce what was shared on this account that claimed affiliation with UC San
Diego, and condemn all forms of racism and hate,” the official UCSD statement reads. “We
understand a similar account posted, claiming affiliation with another university. The Office
for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination (OPHD) is working with our Chief
Information Security Officer to investigate the incident.”
The advent of this Instagram page is not the first time African American students at UCSD
have faced blatant discrimination. A decade ago, the university had another incident, now
known as the Compton Cookout, during which students had a “costume” party where guests
wore stereotypical African American attire and accessories. The event was followed by
multiple racially motivated episodes, including a noose found in Geisel Library and a Ku Klux
Klan hood found adorned on the Dr. Seuss statue. The racist events have since gained
notoriety as the Black Winter.
The university has since taken steps to address the Black Winter by supporting programs and
initiatives to promote diversity and cultural awareness on campus. The Office for Equity,
Diversity, and Inclusion, the academic DEI requirement, and various cultural resource
centers were created following the events. In February 2020, UCSD held a remembrance
event (https://ucsdguardian.org/2020/02/23/office-of-edi-and-bsu-hold-event-in-
remembrance-of-black-winter/) to mark the 10-year anniversary of the Black Winter. 
However, in light of the racist Instagram accounts, the rise of racial tensions in the United
States, and the long-standing reality that African American students make up only 2.6
percent of the undergraduate population (https://ir.ucsd.edu/_files/stats-
data/profile/profile-2018-2019.pdf), UCSD still faces additional obstacles to ensure a
supportive and diverse environment. Moreover, the university has yet to respond to the list of
demands (https://ucsdguardian.org/2020/07/06/black-student-union-issues-statement-of-
demands-to-ucsd/) the BSU sent to administrators in June 2020. To learn more about this
and ways to take action, refer to the organization’s Twitter page

If you have any information regarding the incidents, please contact the Office for the
Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination at OPHD@ucsd.edu. UCSD officials have
stated that the individuals involved, if a part of the UCSD community, will be held
accountable for their actions, but have not yet explained what punishments, if any, the
culprits would face.
