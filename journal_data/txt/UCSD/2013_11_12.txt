UCSD’s General Store can no 
longer sell tobacco after recieving 
a cease and desist letter on Oct. 
4 as a result of the University of 
California-wide tobacco ban insti -
tuted on Sept. 1. 
The facility — located in the 
Student Center — was previously 
the only place on campus where 
students could buy cigarettes.
Co-op manager Wesley Jones, 
who used to manage the cigarettes 
and tobacco products the General 
Store sold, said that the cease and 
desist letter from University Centers 
came as a surprise.
“Most of the frustration is that 
it kicked in at the beginning of the 
year and we thought it wouldn’t be 
enforced until 2014, ” Jones said. “It 
would have been a more gradual 
change for us, and now we’re all on 
our toes about everything. ”
Originally, the ban was going to 
be implemented on Jan. 1 of 2014 
with the rest of the UCs (other than 
UCLA), leading to the confusion 
about the start date of the ban. 
University Centers met with the 
General Store last April to make 
the store aware of the ban and to 
encourage the employees to con -
sider other products. 
“The General Store indicated 
they were aware and had already 
been discussing other products, ” 
University Centers Director Sharon 
Van Bruggen said. “The notice was 
sent on Oct. 4 in response to a com -
plaint University Centers received 
about the ongoing sale of cigarettes 
at the General Store. ”
Although the store has abided 
by the ban since then, employees 
have heard rumors of RSOs sending 
students undercover to check in on 
the business.
“It looks bad on their part that 
they’re trying to catch us in the act 
just because we are a student-run org 
even though we are complying with 
their wishes, ” Jones said. “Whether 
or not they are spying on us, we 
shouldn’t be doing it in the first 
place. It’s good that we’re keeping 
up this relationship with the school; 
changes have to happen. ”
This change is immense for the 
General Store, as tobacco sales pre -
viously accounted for roughly 50 
percent of the business’s total rev -
enue. However, the store has been 
faring surprisingly well under the 
circumstances largely due to steady 
book sales.
“We have high customer loyalty, ” 
Jones said. “Everyone was just excit -
ed to have cigarettes sold on campus, 
and not badly priced at that, so they

maintenance workers from the 
American Federation of State, County,

for the second time this year with 96 percent

The strike comes after over a year of 
stalled negotiations between the UC system 
and workers represented by AFSCME, which includes 13,000 health workers throughout the 
system’s ten campuses. The two parties have 
been unable to reach a contract agreement due 
in part to an increase in mandated pension 
contributions for employees from 5 percent to 
6.5 percent, which will mean less take-home 
pay initially.

THE CORGI CRAZE  FEATURES, P . 6San Diego’s City Council unani -
mously approved the San Diego Five-
Y ear Plan Update last Tuesday, which 
will begin restoring employees and 
equipment cut from the police depart -
ment during the city’s budget crisis. 
According to a report by the Public 
Safety & Neighborhood Services 
Committee, chaired by Councilwoman 
Marti Emerald, the San Diego Police 
Department suffered heavy financial 
losses by recent funding deficits. 
“Our city is facing many public 
safety decisions that are important to 
our residents. Public safety is both a 
primary responsibility of local govern -
ment and a core expectation of the San 
Diegans we serve, ” Emerald said in 
a press release. “The approval of this 
plan will begin to address the needs of 
our police department. ”
SDPD experienced a shortage of 
workers in every position. It currently 
has a budgeted staffing level of 1,970, but only 1,821 officers are actually 
serving on the force. An independent 
study ranked 75 police agencies in 
California based on their overall sala -
ries and placed the SDPD in 68th 
place. Because of this, the number of 
new recruits is being outpaced by the 
number of veteran officers leaving for 
other police departments that can offer 
higher salaries and benefits. The SDPD 
can lose up to 12 active or potential 
officers every month. 
The department’s budget allows for 
504 civilian employees, but only 468 
workers are currently on duty. In addi -
tion, a number of other positions, like 
the Mounted Enforcement Units and 
Police Investigative Aides, were cut 
down and the ABLE police chopper’s 
flight time was reduced from ten to six 
hours a day. 
As a result, the department has 
become less effective in enforcing the 
law and preventing infractions. Despite 
a previous decline in crime rates, vio -
lent crime increased by 12.6 percent in the first five 
months of 2012. 
F u r t h e r m o r e , 
response times for 
all priority calls 
slowed down in 
2011, compared to 
the previous year. 
The Five-Y ear 
Plan will reverse 
these trends by 
allocating over 
$11 million in 
extra funding 
for the SDPD. 
Along with other 
cost-reduction programs, the money 
should help the department hire an 
additional 258 sworn officers and civil -
ian employees over the next five years. 
The money will also be used to reno -
vate police facilities and upgrade their 
aging technology and vehicles. This 
includes replacing the critical 9-1-1 
Computer Aided Dispatch system, 
which still uses outdated and increas -ingly unreliable software. 
With the Five-Year Plan slated 
to run through the fiscal year 2018, 
the City Council hopes to provide 
a stronger police presence in San 
Diego, with up-to-date equipment, 
faster response times and decreased 
overtime expenses. P THE UCSD GUARDIAN | TUESDAY , NOVERMBER 12, 2013 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  !"Q1

PHOTO BY DANIEL YUAN / GUARDIAN FILEunlawful practices to coerce employ -
ees into working for low wages and 
reduced benefits, leading the union 
to file a complaint with the Public 
Employment Relations Board.
“Our members have engaged in 
good faith bargaining and offered 
meaningful compromises designed 
to build ladders to the middle class 
and make UC facilities safer for stu -
dents and patients, ” Lybarger said. 
“UC’s response has been to illegally 
intimidate and bully the front-line 
workers who serve the public.
Representatives from the UC 
system contend that a PERB hearing 
does not indicate any wrongdoing 
on the health system’s behalf, as the 
board is required to look into all 
labor disputes.
UC Vice President of Systemwide 
Human Resources and Programs 
Dwaine Duckett gave a statement on 
behalf of the administration, which issued its final offer on wages over 
the summer.
“We are very disappointed that 
AFSCME’s leadership has asked 
its members to strike for a sec -
ond time in seven months, once 
again putting patient care in the 
middle of a labor contract dispute, ” 
Duckett’s statement read. “We have 
done everything we can to end the 
cycle of conflict and dysfunction. 
Unfortunately, despite our efforts, 
there has been no reciprocation on 
AFSCME’s part, and we are still far 
from an agreement. ”
Both the union and the UC 
administration have accused each 
other of actions that result in fee 
increases for students and patients. 
UC believes that an across-the-
board wage increase for AFSCME’s 
workers will inevitably lead to higher 
premiums for patients and students 
enrolled in SHIP .
However, AFSCME has argued 
that the health system has already leaned too much on students to alle -
viate its debt, while awarding top-lev -
el executives with salaries of upwards 
of $250,000.
AFSCME went on strike for two 
days in May of this year, costing the 
UC health system $20 million. In 
September, the union’s service work -
ers held demonstrations around cam -
pus by banging pots and pans in pro -
test of low pensions, that, according 
to the union, total $20,000 for over 20 
years of work.
According to Duckett’s statement, 
the California Nurses’ Association, 
which is in the midst of its own 
contract negotiations with the UC 
system, intends to hold a sympathy 
strike in conjunction with AFSCME.
No dates have been set for the 
strike, but AFSCME can call one 
anytime provided that they give a 
10-day notice.!"Q1  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | TUESDAY , NOVERMBER 12, 2013 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  S

Although the customers remain 
loyal, the General Store is concerned 
with how it can best serve the pre -
vious tobacco-buying customers, 
about 50 percent of who were faculty 
members while many others were 
international students. Currently, the 
General Store is focused on main -taining a lively atmosphere to keep 
disheartened customers distracted.
However, members of the 
General Store noted that serving 
these customers in the long run has 
proven more difficult because the 
ban forbids the sale of e-cigarettes, 
nicotine liquids, nicotine-free liq -
uids, nicotine patches, or anything 
considered “tobacco paraphernalia, ” 
even if the product is designed to help smokers quit.
“We’re trying to get alternatives 
for those people because they’re our 
main customers, ” Jones said. “There 
are no real suggestions yet but we 
have big things coming. Even though 
the store’s pretty small, it’s bigger 
than it looks. ”Co-op Members Concerned About T obacco-Buying CustomersUC Representatives Voice Disappointment in AFSCME Vote

Given the amount I complain 
on a daily basis, one would 
think I was being exposed to 
linear algebra, nails on a chalkboard 
and spinach all at once. And yet, my 
most pressing first-world problems 
usually have something to do with 
how long it takes my iTunes album 
art to load or with the mildly annoy -
ing shuffling noises from the apart -
ment upstairs.
It’s obvious that my problems 
are rather pathetic in the scheme of 
things. I have an absurdly comfy bed 
with a roof over my head, limbs and 
a brain that occasionally functions 
and the distinct pleasure of signing 
a 92092 postal code. Rather justifi -
ably, my disconsolate whining tends 
to irritate my parents and friends. 
In my defense, though, it turns out 
that complaining is one of our most 
favored forms of communication; 
without it, we could all just be sad, 
social outcasts.
University of Louisville psycholo -
gist Michael Cunningham attributes 
our tendency to grumble to the 
warning shouts that our early human 
predecessors would give when under 
attack. Although that seems a far cry 
from the exasperated sigh I give when 
forced to wait in line for a burrito, 
complaining — and, more broadly, 
pointing out everything wrong with 
the world — is usually a reliable way 
to start a conversation.
For those of us who scoff at the 
usual small talk comments on the 
week’s events and the Chargers’ 
record, it’s easy to catch a stranger’s 
attention and start a chat by point -
ing out something like a drafty 
window. You’re shivering, they’re 
shivering, and a conversation has 
been struck up, even if it’s just a 
cascade of complaints about how 
shoddy construction was in the 
1990s. Pointing out life’s flaws tends 
to unite people, whether it’s over the 
length of Goody’s queues or over 
the ironic fact that Thanksgiving 
break shoved your essay due date 
forward one week.
Voicing dissatisfaction also has 
purpose beyond breaking the ice. 
In some respect, it acts as a sort of 
stress relief; it allows us to vent about 
our frustrations, significant or other -
wise. And as soon as we can relate to 
the problems of others, we jump into 
the discussion with alacrity, eager to 
share our own vexing experiences. 
We happily assure ourselves that 
there are others out there who feel 
the same way or sympathize, and a 
burden is lifted from our shoulders.
Interestingly enough, companies’ 
marketing strategies manipulate our 
inner complainer with good results. 
Ads often mention common annoy -
ances, followed in short order by a 
$59.95-plus-shipping solution. We 
evaluate our lives and agree that we do 
in fact suffer from inadequately absor -
bent paper towels, snarky credit card 
service employees and high-interest 
bail bonds. And right away, the prod -
uct for sale draws our fancy.
While it can lure us into pur -
chases we might regret later, finding 
faults is often a surprisingly versatile 
tool — it helps us connect with oth -
ers and can even occasionally lead to 
positive change. It’s just important to 
remember that if the biggest prob -
lem facing us at the moment is an 
annoying song playing on the radio, 
our lives are pretty awesome.While ride sharing is convenient and econom -
ical, the reliability of unregulated citizen drivers 
is highly problematic. Companies like Uber, Lyft 
and Sidecar, which utilize smartphone apps to 
provide informal and on-demand transporta -
tion, have evaded policies regarding passenger 
safety, driver qualifications and liability concerns. 
According to The Huffington Post, Uber has 
already been charged with licensing offenses, 
served with cease-and-desist orders and banned 
in some states, illustrating their disregard for 
standards of professionalization. 
Because they operate privately, ride-sharing 
companies have fought for exemption from the 
regulations of city Public Utilities Committees. Such 
resistance has elicited a negative response from 
the International Association of Transportation 
Regulators, which has supported local efforts to 
“curb the unsafe, unregulated expansion of rogue 
car service apps. ” While these companies’ informal -
ity has its benefits, “peer-to-peer transportation” 
should supplement — and not substitute — a quali -
fied and safety-conscious driver workforce. 
Moreover, the ridesharing companies’ failure 
to implement stringent rules has led to conflicts 
regarding insurance. Geico recently denied cover -
age for a Lyft driver involved in an accident because 
the driver’s personal automobile insurance coverage 
is insufficient when carrying commercial passen -
gers. These incidents highlight a lack of account -
ability, as it is still unclear who would be held liable 
in the event of a mishap.
The ride-sharing business is undoubtedly a pro -
gressive movement. However, safety and appropri -
ate licensing should not be sacrificed for the benefit 
of proprietors. If these companies wish to prosper 
in the long run, professionalization and passenger 
safety should remain undisputed priorities.

Contributing WriterCompanies’ Price Advantages and 
Flexibility Are Ideal for StudentsRidesharing Services Provide Healthy 
Competition in Transportation SectorAccountability and Safety Must Be 
Prioritized, Along With Convenience
Taxis may have been the workhorse of conve -
nient transportation for individuals in another 
era, but it is time for them to revamp the way 
they work. Ridesharing companies such as Lyft 
and Uber are quickly making a sizable dent in 
the market share of taxi services. In order to 
compete, taxis will need to become less costly 
and figure out a new approach that will give 
them an edge in the race to transport. 
Taxis have long been a quick way for the 
average person to travel, but their exorbitant 
prices and the difficulty associated with hailing 
them have made taxi travel unappealing. These 
shortcomings make ridesharing services a much 
cheaper (and oftentimes quicker) alternative. 
Instead of hailing a cab on the street or contact -
ing a taxi service to contact a driver, rideshare 
companies use smartphone apps to connect 
users and orchestrate rides. Users are given the 
opportunity to directly interact with drivers for a 
smooth experience. 
The streamlined ridesharing process has 
earned many positive responses from its users. 
In major metropolitan areas such as Seattle, 
many citizens have been embracing ridesharing 
despite the city’s competition between taxi com -
panies and rideshare services. Reddit users have 
voiced their disatisfaction with taxi services’ 
unreliable, inconvenient monopoly on individual 
transportation. 
Although ridesharing is a fairly new concept, 
it has taken root and had success in major cit -
ies across America over the past five years. The 
companies at the forefront of this revolution are 
quickly making sure that taxis will no longer 
have a stranglehold on the personal transporta -
tion sector, providing some healthy, long-over -
due competition.
— CH ARU MEHRA
Contributing WriterThe recent development of smartphone-based 
ridesharing companies, such as Uber, Lyft and 
Sidecar, has raised controversy in regards to safety 
concerns and their legitimacy as bona fide trans -
portation services. Despite these concerns, the 
state of California approved regulations for these 
ridesharing companies on Sept. 19, making it an 
official transportation category in California that 
is here to stay. 
Given the ongoing transportation changes, this 
approval will ultimately prove economically ben -
eficial to students who cannot afford alternative 
modes of transportation.
These services provide an economical and 
convenient option for both San Diego residents 
and college students. Many ridesharing compa -
nies do not have a set price but rather suggest 
a donation that the customer can make to the 
driver. And while it is suggested that passengers 
pay that suggested donation, it is not necessary 
for every company or service. These flexible and 
affordable services are ideal for a college student 
on a budget, who can only pay as much as their 
income allows.
For students who use the bus infrequently, 
ridesharing services may be the quickest and 
most economical way to go on the occasional off-
campus trip. Currently, students who don’t own 
a car get to downtown San Diego by taking the 
MTS 150 bus route, which takes an average of 40 
minutes. In comparison, the trip on a service such 
as Uber could take only 20 minutes by car, not 
including waiting times.
By embracing ridesharing, UCSD students will 
have a more convenient and affordable means at 
getting themselves to certain places, rather than 
relying on a transportation system that they have 
no control over.

Staff WriterToddlers and  
Technology
Students need more 
opportunities to learn 
basic computer science 
code and programming 
before they go to college.
Although most toddlers are still learning 
how to sing the alphabet and tie their 
shoes, by summer 2014, some kids may 
be learning how to code. Former designers and 
programmers from Amazon, Apple, Google and 
Symantec founded Play-i, the company that has 
created kid-friendly robots, Bo and Y ana, to teach 
kids as young as 5 basic programming. While 
some may be skeptical as to whether or not these 
robots can actually teach kids the intricacies of 
something as complex as coding, Play-i is taking 
steps in the right direction. 
Toys such as these will be effective in 
cultivating the next generation of programmers, 
but progress needs to be made on other fronts 
as well. Though the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
predicts that there will be 4.6 million jobs in 
computing in technology by 2020, big technology 
companies will still have trouble finding 
American talent to fill them, if our education 
system continues to neglect offering computer 
science in its curriculum.As society becomes more reliant on 
technology to run our governments, businesses 
and everyday functions, the demand for training 
qualified computer scientists also significantly 
increases. By slowly implementing code into K–12 
curriculum and encouraging young individuals 
to take advantage of organizations that actually 
teach students how to code, students will be better 
prepared to take on computer science as a major 
in college and in future careers.
The perks of job security, unique benefits and 
lucrative starting salaries have caught the eyes of 
many students, but the preparation for a career in 
computer science is not that easy. In March 2013, 
Code.org released a viral online video featuring 
a diverse mix of technology giants, politicians 
and celebrities with the message that “anyone 
can learn how to code” with the right tools and 
mindset. These famous figures urged viewers to 
code, talked about their early experiences coding 
and emphasized that programming could be done 
by anyone who could put their mind to it. While the video campaign gave alternative perspectives 
to what many have deemed as an impossible 
field of study meant for a select few intellectuals, 
the non-profit’s message that students need to 
have the opportunity to learn code before college 
continues to be overlooked.
As the United States looks to improve the 
standard of education nationwide, the need 
for options to complete both introductory 
and advanced coursework in technology 
and computers must also improve with it. 
According to the College Board examination 
service, Advanced Placement Computer Science 
comprised less than 1 percent of the 2011 AP 
exams taken in California. While AP Computer 
Science exams remain a low approximate 24,000, 
other AP subjects like calculus and biology 
easily exceed 150,000 test takers nationwide. 
Though more students are taking AP exams 
on a national level, the number of computer =>''18?604''958 .#/0"0#".-+01#$.
311?<@68 @354'''AB''1 B44''785
See CODE , page 5science exams has remained relatively 
consistent for more than a decade. 
If the United States is looking for 
better programmers, society and the 
government will need to invest in 
these students’ education by giving 
them the tools to learn basic code and 
programming languages.
Another compounding issue 
is that as their field becomes 
increasingly popular, serious 
computer science students will need 
better preparation before going 
off to colleges and institutions 
with impacted computer science 
majors. In Fall 2013, UCSD’s 
computer science and engineering 
department announced both computer science and computer 
engineering as impacted majors, due 
to unprecedented growth in student 
interest. Students who wish to declare 
any of these majors must further 
apply to do so through a comparative 
process that looks at their 
performance against other prospective 
computer science students. By giving 
more students the opportunity to 
learn code before jumping into a 
brand-new, competitive field of study, 
more students won’t be left in the dust 
by the select few who already have 
prior programming experience.
Society is dependent on excellent 
computer scientists but unfairly 
gives budding students a short 
amount of time to develop their 
skills. Campaigns that wish to simply increase interest in coding are not 
enough; showing kids the cool 
break rooms and benefits at Google 
headquarters won’t realistically 
prepare and educate students about 
the work that entails to become a 
computer programmer or scientist.
A society so focused on new, 
innovative technologies needs to 
recognize that students also need 
more early opportunities to learn. 
Though Bo and Yana’s impact may 
be small, Play-i’s mission is headed 
in the right direction by giving 
kids the opportunity to learn and 
expose themselves to the world of 
computer science.!"#$#!$  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | TU ESDAY , NOV ERMB ER 12, 2013 | WWW. UCSDGUARDIAN .ORG %

Dear Editor,
City Attorney Jan Goldsmith said 
in a recent interview that he and his 
staff strategized as lawyers: “How 
were we going to remove the mayor?” 
“It was a de facto impeachment. ” It 
was a putsch.
Former San Diego Mayor Bob 
Filner awaits a Dec. 9, 2013 sentencing 
for his guilty plea on charges brought 
by State Attorney General Kamala 
Harris. In early July 2013 — as one 
woman after another went public 
with accusations of sexual harass -
ment against him — City Attorney 
Goldsmith and his staff concluded 
that Filner was an unrepentant felon 
and that women at City Hall needed 
to be protected. /uni00A0Goldsmith was 
prepared to plead before a judge that 
the mayor posed a threat to women 
and should be barred from City Hall 
by way of a Temporary Restraining 
Order. A psychologist retained by him 
was set to testify that Filner fit the pat -
tern of a sociopath.
Filner, 71, was the first Democratic 
mayor elected in San Diego in two 
decades. Goldsmith, a Republican 
serving his second term as city attor -
ney, had endorsed Filner›s Grand Old 
Party opponent, Carl DeMaio.
Goldsmith then maneuvered 
to force Filner out of office — by 
squeezing him financially, bluffing 
him about state law and about the 
efficacy of that possible restraining 
order backed by the fly-by-night psy -
chologist and embarrassing Filner by 
releasing doctored documents show -
ing the anger and dismay of Filner’s 
City Hall staff. /uni00A0Goldsmith, a former 
judge, said he believes it was the threat 
of the restraining order, which finally 
persuaded the ordinarily combative 
mayor to surrender. /uni00A0Skywriting helped.
I testified at a City Council hear -
ing that the Honorable Members were 
“between a rock and a hard place” 
because, having all asked the mayor 
to resign, they were still forced by law 
to pay for his defense. Goldsmith was 
there, too. He lied. He said that a cop 
who demanded sexual favors from 
prostitutes in exchange for leniency 
had to be defended in court but the 
mayor failed to meet this exacting 
standard (somehow). I and another 
citizen took the trouble to testify, but 
Mr. City Attorney seems to think we’ll 
laugh it off now that he has admitted 
he gave the mayor false interpretations 
concerning state law. Indeed — since 
I voted for him — I feel intense voter 
remorse.
Earlier Goldsmith had advised the 
Council that Filner was required by 
law to sign a tax regime favoring hote -
liers that was to last four decades into 
the future. A judge shortly thereafter 
upheld Filner.
The 200+ members of the 
Democratic National Committee 
meeting in Phoenix voted unani -
mously (by voice, without discussion) 
to demand his resignation. Bob had 
signed his resignation prior to the 
convocation of the DNC and that 
signed document was being held by a 
mediator pending City Council of San 
Diego acceptance and more impor -
tantly, public input on the details of a 
done deal.

SPOTTED AT UCSD
Ventus has made multiple appearances on campus, 
excitedy giving strangers kisses and attacking 
anyone who gives him attention or treats.SKEPTICAL CORGI
Ventus found himself the subject of an Internet meme, 
“Skeptical Corgi,” when a photo of him squinting at the 
veterinarian’s ofﬁce was repurposed by Tumblr users. 
The original photo now has over 400,000 notes.When two roommates from UCSD decided to adopt 
a puppy together the summer of 2012, they never 
expected he would become a star and introduce 
them to an entire online community of corgi superfans along 
the way. With soft, orange-brown fur, a big, goofy smile 
and tender eyes that sparkle, Ventus, a year-and-a-half-old 
Pembroke Welsh Corgi, has captured the hearts of thousands 
over social media in San Diego and beyond.
Ventus is the subject of popular Tumblr and Instagram 
accounts that document his life in San Diego with his own -
ers, UCSD seniors Pauline Vu and Kirsten Koa, who’ve been 
rooming together for more than a year.
“When we got [Ventus], we wanted somewhere to put 
pictures of him as he was getting bigger, ” Koa said.
The Tumblr, “Ventus the Corgi, ” was launched in 2012 
when Ventus was a puppy and has almost 3,000 followers to 
date. Most of its photos capture Ventus in his natural, day-
to-day conduct and setting, while others show him donning 
distinct accessories, like eyeglasses, a colorful bowtie and 
even a crab hat. Each photo is paired with a witty caption 
and has several dozen “notes, ” likes and reblogs from other 
Tumblr users.  
But it wasn’t until one of Ventus’ puppy photos was 
turned into a meme that he earned a serious Internet fol -
lowing. The meme, titled “Skeptical Corgi, ” presents the 
then-puppy corgi sitting on a counter and squinting at a vet -
erinarian’s office. The original meme said, “So you’re telling 
me [...] you’re taking off my balls instead of going walkies?” 
The original meme got over 400,000 notes, and one iteration 
of it even claimed the 26th spot on BuzzFeed’s “The 40 Most 
Influential Corgis of 2012. ” 
“The puppy pictures [of Ventus] were really big, and people [gave him] shout-
outs, ” Vu said.
Vu and Koa also decided 
to make him an Instagram, 
@ventusthecorgi, so that 
they could more easily 
and quickly post photos of 
Ventus on a regular basis. 
Ventus’ Instagram includes 
more frequent photos of 
Ventus on walks, in Vu 
and Koa’s apartment and 
at UCSD. The account has 
nearly 3,000 followers, and 
each picture earns, on aver -
age, roughly 300 likes.
Ventus became even 
more known after some help from more famous corgi blogs.
 “‘Corgi Addict’ was a really popular Tumblr, ” Vu said. 
“She reblogged some of our notes. ” 
Ventus grew in popularity through the corgi Internet 
community, a network of corgis and their owners who use 
social media to share their corgis with the world.
“The corgi community is pretty active, especially in 
southern California, ” Koa said. “[We’ve] met a lot of other 
corgi owners, and we [became] friends with them. Then [we 
posted] pictures with their dogs, and [they posted pictures 
with Ventus]. We got a lot of followers that way. ”
Vu and Koa didn’t expect that Ventus would become an 
Internet sensation.
“We made the Tumblr for Ventus in hopes of keeping 
an online scrapbook of his pictures and to document his

growth, ” Vu said. “We did not expect at first for him to go 
viral, but when he did, we were just really happy. ”
Vu and Koa have also discovered that owning Ventus has 
made people treat them differently.
“Whenever people see anything to do with corgis, they 
send it to me, because they think I’m the crazy corgi lady, ” 
Koa said. 
As a side project and as a way to promote Ventus, Vu 
and Koa decided to create a game called Corgi Memory — a 
memory card game inspired by real-life corgis. Vu designed 
and drew all of the characters in the game, all based on 
famous Internet corgis. 
“I thought [Corgi Memory] would be a good project 
since memory games are pretty simple to program, ” Koa 
said. “[Also], Pauline is trying to get into project and design. ” 
While Corgi Memory was intended to be a fun, personal project, Vu and Koa have seen it add to Ventus’ — and other 
corgis’ — fame.
“It was kind of like a marketing technique, ” Koa said. “ All 
[the other popular] corgis have thousands of followers, [and] 
all these owners are happy to see their corgis in a game and 
cartoonified. They help us promote the game. ”
Now, Corgi Memory has around 2,000 downloads on the 
Apple App Store and has over 20 customer reviews, all with 
four or five stars.
“[Because of] the awesome reaction that we’ve gotten 
from the community, we’re planning on doing more things 
later on, like creating a game that’s not just a memory game, ” 
Koa said.
Despite the phenomenon Ventus has become online, Vu 
and Koa also love him as the dog they adopted a year and 
a half ago.
“[Ventus] has a very unique personality — he thinks he is 
human half the time, ” Vu said. “Ventus can sense your emo -
tions, and he chooses how he reacts to them. When you are 
sad, he will comfort you, and when you are upset, he knows 
to give you space. ” 
Though Ventus’ fame was never intended, or even 
expected, Vu and Koa expressed their gratitude toward 
his fans.
“We are really happy that he has so many followers, and 
we try to update his social media threads every day, ” Vu said. 
“We are also really glad that people love Ventus as much as 
we do, and [we are] more than willing to share his life with 
the people who adore him. ”

Not all students know what they 
want to do after receiving their col -
lege diploma. “Off Campus,” an 
independent radio show and pod -
cast launched in 2013, broadcasts 
interviews with college graduates to 
help students navigate the ambigu -
ous waters of life beyond school.
The show features individuals 
who have followed unique — and 
often unexpected — trajectories 
with regard to their careers, such as 
Juilliard graduate Rachel Winard, 
a professional violinist turned soap 
company owner. Recently, the show 
has even turned the spotlight on a 
former Triton: UCSD alumnus Willy 
Staley, whose article on McDonald’s 
McRib sandwich landed him his job 
as a writer for the New Y ork Times.
“Off Campus” was founded and 
is hosted by Ari King, who was 
inspired by his own confusion and 
reservations about entering the 
career field after graduating from 
Wesleyan University in 2009. He 
also wrote a book, “Now What?! 
Conversations About College, 
Graduation, and the Next Step, ” to 
tell post-graduation stories to advise 
the confused student. His book was 
published in 2013, and he now aims 
to further this initiative through 
“Off Campus.”
“I spent three years interview -
ing people that came from different 
schools, backgrounds and majors, ” 
King said. “The show is basically 
a continuation of the book. It has 
gone from an idea to a book and a 
book to a radio show and podcast. ”
Kings feels that it’s both hum -
bling and comforting to hear about 
the trials and triumphs of former 
college students who never had their 
destined career paths all figured 
out. He believes that “Off Campus” allows its interviewees’ personal 
voices to be heard and its listen -
ers to get what they will out of the 
related stories.
“Everyone has their own stories 
to tell and their own pieces of advice 
to give, ” King said. “People are going 
to respond to these interviews differ -
ently. They’re going to resonate with 
certain interviews more than others. There isn’t one piece of advice that 
can be given to the masses. ” 
King hopes the site will become 
an important resource for those who 
aren’t sure where they’ll go after 
they’ve completed their education.
“I see the site growing and hav -
ing more and more people being 
interviewed and [becoming] a part 
of ‘Off Campus’ and, perhaps, going to different campuses and talking 
to different students and alumni [to 
find out] what they want to do and 
what they’re up, ” King said. “[I would 
like to] have it grow and have more and 
more people tune in and contribute 
and really turn it into a great podcast 
and radio show. ”
Students can tune in to Brooklyn 
Community Radio, or BBOX Radio, every Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 11 
a.m. Pacific Standard Time, or visit the 
“Off Campus” site, www.thisisoffcam -
pus.org, for podcasted shows to listen 
to the real stories of the struggles and 
accomplishments of those who have 
made the transition out of college.As a leading institution in biotech 
studies and research, it’s no surprise 
that UCSD is also a trailblazer in the 
field of energy. Our campus is home 
to a complex microgrid system that 
generates nearly all of its own energy 
across the span of 1200 acres. 
A microgrid is a centralized system 
that uses solar energy, wind energy, 
fuel cells or other sources to meet local 
energy needs. Its varied energy sources 
and localization makes such a system 
highly reliable. In fact, in an interview 
with the Rocky Mountain Institute, 
UCSD Director of Strategic Energy 
Initiatives Byron Washom said that 
UCSD’s microgrid remained remark -
ably functional during a blackout that 
affected Arizona, southern California 
and northern Mexico on Sept. 8, 2011. 
The system is located in the Central Utilities Plant, which is on the western 
edge of Revelle College across from 
the UCSD School of Medicine.
Washom discussed the microgrid’s 
energy efficiency in terms of a single, 
self-sustaining unit.
“We think of ourselves as an 
island, and on this island, we self-
generate 92 percent of all of our own 
electricity and 95 percent of all of 
our heating and cooling, ” Washom 
said. “From this island, we only 
depend upon the local utility for 8 
percent of our electricity. ”
However, the microgrid isn’t only 
efficient with regard to energy. Since 
energy is the second-largest expense 
for UCSD (second only to salaries), 
as indicated by Washom, it’s also 
important for the microgrid system 
to be cost-effective. Saving approxi -
mately $850,000 per month in energy 
costs, Washom said, the system proves economically viable, as it operates at 
about half the price it would cost 
UCSD to import the same amount 
of energy.
In the public eye, the microgrid at 
UCSD is an international innovation. 
High-profile individuals from all over 
the world have come to campus to take 
the VIP tour, which runs about once a 
week. The tour, which includes a pre -
sentation on the microgrid, offers an 
in-depth examination of the process 
and internal structure of the system.
“[We’ve] had two Assistant 
Secretaries of the Navy come here, ” 
Washom said. “On [Nov. 18], the 
Executive Committee of Arizona 
Public Service is flying in just to see 
this. Just about every public utility 
commissioner and California Energy 
commissioner has been on campus for 
the tour. So it’s globally recognized as 
being one of the flagship microgrids in the world. ”
The origins of such an ever-advanc -
ing system date back to the 1960s, 
when the University of California des -
ignated much of the closed Marine 
Corps base Camp Matthews to the 
development of UCSD. The Central 
Utilities Plant was the very first build -
ing on campus and was later modified 
to use the excess heat produced by the 
plant to generate electricity.
Perhaps the most important aspect 
of the microgrid in regards to UCSD 
is its relevance to students. The system 
provides a vital source of energy to 
the thousands of students on campus 
and also offers interested students the 
educational opportunity to learn and 
intern at one of the most innovative 
facilities in the field of energy technol -
ogy. But according to Washom, at the 
top of the list of important applica -
tions is the overarching message that UCSD is making giant strides where 
few others have ever even trodden. 
“First and foremost, it begins to 
show the students that it’s the art of 
the possible in terms of being energy 
efficient, generating portions of your 
power from renewable resources and 
also energy storage, ” Washom said. 
“Their campus is really a pioneer of 
the future of energy. ” 
Washom emphasized that the 
process of becoming truly efficient 
is interminable. 
“It’s never ending, ” he said. “[With 
regards to] the ability to continue to 
conserve our use of precious resourc -
es, like energy and water, there’s always 
room for improvement. It’s an innova -
tion [that is] allowing us these contin -
ual improvements in our efficiency. ”.TIO[PQX5QKZWOZQLI\=+;,8QWVMMZ[QV-VMZOa-NÅKQMVKa

The UCSD men’s and women’s 
swim teams dropped to 1–1 after 
losing to UC Santa Barbara in their 
dual meet last Saturday.
The men’s team was defeated by 
the Gauchos with a final tally of 
184–113, while the women fell by a 
slightly tighter margin with a final 
of 172–123.
After a strong showing in their 
season opener at home against 
C l are m ont - Mu d d - S c r ipp s , t h e 
Tritons hit a stumbling block on the 
road to what looks to be a promising 
season for UCSD swim. 
However, the Tritons did record 
a solid ten individual wins in the 
Saturday meet. All-American and 
NCAA National Champion senior 
Nicholas Korth posted two wins for 
the men, while senior Sandy Hon, 
senior Anji Shakya and sophomore 
Naomi Thomas each picked up two 
for the women. 
“I think both Nick Korth and 
Paul Li had a great meet, ” senior 
Alex Merrill said. “Nick had solid 
breaststroke races, and despite Paul’s 
hard schedule, he managed very well 
and was able to score big points. ”
Merrill said the men will certain -
ly have some kinks to work out over 
the coming weeks, with this shaky 
start to their season. “It was our first travel trip of the 
year and I think some of the team 
just needed to get the jitters out, ” 
Merrill said. “Some of the team are 
also trying out new race strategies 
and techniques, so any dual meet 
is a great place to see if they work 
or not. ”
Back in October, UCSD topped 
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps in its sea -
son/home opener. The Triton men 
defeated Claremont 174–126, while 
the women won with a final score 
of 191–107. 
UCSD came out with top marks 
in 28 of the 34 events that day.
Putting the victories over 
Claremont aside, the women had a 
tough time against the Gauchos.
“I thought that we did really 
well for going up against a team 
that is completely fueled by schol -
arship money, ” said senior Lindsay 
Oosterhouse, who competed in her 
first meet this year on Saturday 
after missing the Claremont-Mudd-
Scripps match-up.
The Triton women’s freestyle 
relay team of freshman Austine Lee, 
sophomore Colleen Daley, junior 
Sierra Robbins and senior anchor 
Shakya took the top time for the 200-
meter relay with a time of 1.36.17.
The team was positive about its 
individual successes on Saturday 
and will look to charge forward with 
the rest of its upcoming meets. “We lost by less than 50 points 
and won seven women’s events, and 
the energy after the meet definitely 
reflected that success, ” Oosterhouse 
said.
Shakya — a 2012 national cham -
pion — also took the top spot in her 
individual races, the 200-meter free 
(1.51.40) and the 500-meter free 
(4.59.50). 
Freshman Sasha Mitrushina 
made waves in her first collegiate 
meet Saturday. The freshman placed 
second in the 1000-meter free in her 
debut for the Triton women.
“Our main focus this quarter is 
our Arena Invite, which is in two 
weeks, where we will be really gear -
ing up to go fast and qualify people 
for [the NCAA national meet] which 
will be in March, ” Merrill said. 
The Tritons will put in two hard 
weeks of practice to gear up for the 
Arena Invitational, Thursday, Nov. 
21 through Saturday, Nov. 23. 
“The little things are going to be 
a big part of training, ” Oosterhouse 
said. “We’ve put in the hard work 
and done the yardage we need to be 
prepared, but refining the techni -
cal aspects like turns, starts, relay 
exchanges and breakouts are things 
that are really going to make a dif -
ference when we race in two weeks. ”

Men’s Water Polo Ends Regular 
Season Play With 12–13 Overall Record
The Tritons closed their Western Water Polo Association schedule, losing back-
to-back against Cal State Long Beach on Thursday and UC Irvine on Saturday.
The No. 10 men’s water polo 
ended regular season play after fall -
ing 15–13 to Long Beach State and 
then 11–10 to UC Irvine. The Tritons 
finished their 2013 season 12–13 
overall and 4–1 in the Western Water 
Polo Association. 
UCSD recorded its second 
straight overtime loss against Cal 
State Long Beach on Thursday. The 
Tritons held the lead into the final 
quarter, capitalizing on strong play 
from junior driver David Higginson, 
who scored four goals in the cam -
paign. Up 11–8 at the beginning of 
the fourth period, UCSD allowed the 
49ers to rally back and tie the match 
with two minutes left on the clock. 
After a back-and-forth volley in 
the last minute that left UCSD down 
13–12, Higginson was able to force 
overtime by scoring the tying goal 
with 10 seconds left to play. The 
49ers shut out the Triton offense in both overtime periods and added 
two goals to the Long Beach tally, 
winning 15–13.
On Saturday, No. 9 UC Irvine 
beat the Tritons 11–10 after four 
quarters and six lead changes. 
Starting the final period, the 
match was tied at seven goals apiece. 
UC Irvine had two goals at the open -
ing of the period, establishing a 9–7 
lead. Higginson and freshman driver 
Nick Alexander quickly responded 
and tied the game at nine. 
The Anteaters managed another 
goal to go up 10–9, but with one 
minute left in play, junior two-meter 
defense Tommy Friedrich answered 
for UCSD. The Anteater’s final goal 
came with just 17 seconds left on 
the clock, narrowly ending UCSD’s 
upset attempt. 
Higginson scored another four 
goals for the Tritons, with Friedrich 
adding another three.
Coming off three consecu -
tive losses in the last few weeks of play, UCSD will host two exhibition 
matches against club teams Sunset 
San Diego and the San Francisco 
Olympic Club on Saturday, Nov. 16. 
Postseason play will commence 
for the Tritons Nov. 22 to Nov. 23 at 
the Western Water Polo Association 
Championships, which will be held 
at UC Davis. 
The Tritons’ 4–1 record in the 
conference will earn them either the 
No. 1 or No. 2 seed in the tourna -
ment. UC Davis’s performance over 
the next week will decide the final 
conference standings going into the 
championship. The schedule for 
the tournament is expected to be 
released later this week. 
The WWPA champion will get

UCSD cross country
runners who earned All-

End of the Road#!,-- ''#,(./!0
The UCSD men’s and women’s cross country teams both ended their seasons 
last week at the NCAA Regionals.

The NCAA West Regionals held last 
week in Spokane, Wash. marked 
the end of the road for all but one 
member of the UCSD cross country 
team. Sophomore Tareq Alwafai’s 14th 
place finish is good enough to not only 
earn him All-West Region honors but he 
is also the first Triton to qualify for the 
NCAA national meet since 2008.
Alwafai, along with junior Tanner 
Collins and sophomores Marie Diaz and 
Paige Hughes, earned All-West Region 
Honors. Over 300 athletes competed in the 
NCAA Regionals, which drew schools from 
as far as Alaska Anchorage and Brigham 
You n g  Un i v e r s it y – Haw ai i ,  a s  w e l l  a s  c on fe r -
ence rivals Cal State Los Angeles.
 “We are really pleased to have four All-
West Region athletes, ” UCSD head coach Nate 
Garcia said. “Maria and Paige did very well 
and we are very happy with how Collins 
ran. The full squad stepped up; both sides 
improved by over 100 points over last year. ”
 For the men, Chico State continued to 
dominate under the trio of Isaac Chavez, 
Johnny Sanchez and Alfonso Cisneros who 
had blown away the competition at the CCAA 
Championship last month. Chavez won the 
meet with a time of 30:55.9 with Sanchez about 
30 seconds behind, posting a time of 31.32.2. 
Cisneros finished sixth with a time of 31:52.9. All 
three contributed to the low Chico score of 33.
 Alwafai led the Tritons with a time of 
32:26.2 — a new course record for UCSD. Three seconds behind him, Tanner Collins also qualified 
for All-West Region honors with a time of 32:29.8. 
Collins, though close to making it to nationals, 
missed out on the spot by less than two seconds.
The UCSD men finished sixth out of 18 teams 
with a score of 168, 18 points behind Cal Baptist 
and 18 points from a ticket to the NCAA Nationals. 
As expected, Chico State won handily, scoring 
almost 50 points lower than second place Alaska 
Anchorage University.
Diaz and Hughes finished within two seconds of 
each other. Diaz finished 22nd with a time 22:49.6 
and Hughes came in with a time of 22:51.0. Hughes 
and Diaz, although putting up impressive times, 
did not qualify for the national championship.
Susan Tanui, a senior from Alaska Anchorage, 
won the women’s race, finishing with a time of 
21:45.4. Tanui was followed by teammate Joyce 
Kipchumba who put up a time of 21:48.4. Chico 
State’s Ayla Granados, who won this season’s CCAA 
title, finished fifth with a time of 22:07.3. 
Alaska Anchorage took the West Region title, 
beating Chico State 76–79. UCSD finished 11th out 
of 23 teams with a final score of 282.
“Tareq proved to be an individual who can step 
up, ” Garcia said. “But he is headed toward a dif -
ferent experience in nationals without the team 
around him. ”
Alwafai will continue to train for the NCAA

State and Cal Poly Pomona last weekend. 
/T_he Tritons’ back-to-back wins broke a tie 
for second place in the California Colle -
giate Athletic Association, with UCSD sit -
ting two games behind /f_irst place Cal State 
San Bernardino.
“It feels really good [to be ranked sec -
ond], ” UCSD head coach Ricci Luyties 
said. “Now we’re on a mission, trying to 
win all of our last matches, so winning 
[those matches] was huge. ”
Last Friday, the Tritons hosted Hum -
boldt State, a team they beat 3–1 on the 
road earlier in the season. 
UCSD struck /f_irst to put the Tritons in a 
solid lead (9–4). However, the lead quickly 
dwindled as the Lumberjacks edged their 
way back into the game. 
Bad blocking on the Triton’s side made 
it hard for UCSD on defense, but UCSD 
eventually took control again and /f_inished 
the /f_irst set 25–21 with a cheeky tip by 
sophomore setter Heidi Sierks.
/T_he Tritons dominated the next two 
sets. Humboldt State committed several 
errors and could not keep up with UCSD’s 
aggressive play. /T_he Tritons led 13–3 be -fore ending the match with an 
impressive 25–8 score. Sophomores So -
phie Rowe and Danielle Dahle both had 
outstanding games, tallying 10 and eight 
kills, respectively. 
Junior middle blocker Sara McCutchan 
ruled the net with an amazing 11 kills on 
11 attempts. Her 1.00 hitting percentage 
tied the NCAA Division II record, done 
only six times before.
“I feel very honored, ” McCutchan said. 
“Heidi is a great setter, and the middle con -
nection is all about the setter and the mid -
dle, so I feel very lucky to be able to play 
with her. And the whole team played really 
well, so I’m just happy I could contribute. ”
On Saturday, the Tritons took on the 
tougher Cal Poly Pomona, who UCSD beat 
3–2 the last time the two squads met up. 
/T_he Tritons won the /f_irst set 25–14 with 
tough serving and patient defense. But in 
set two, Cal Poly Pomona hastened the 
pace on the attack, to win the second and 
third sets. However, the Tritons stepped up 
to the challenge and easily won 25–15 in 
the fourth set. 
In the tiebreaker, both teams relied on 
defense. With the score at 10–9, UCSD came 
up with three consecutive points to make it 
13–9. /T_he Broncos took a quick point back, 
but a /f_ter a crucial Cal Poly error, junior 
opposite hitter Caitlin Brenton recorded a 
kill for the match point, ending the game at 15–10.
“/T_hings didn’t go as we ex -
pected it to, ” Luyties said. “We 
fell into a tailspin. Amazingly the 
team turned it around, changed 
their attitude and picked every -
thing up. /T_he games we lost were 
just overdoing things, playing 
a little intense. /T_hen we calmed 
down and played like we can. ”
Brenton was solid in all areas, 
posting career-highs with 27 kills and 
33 points. /T_he junior transfer’s 14 digs 
was also a career-best. Libero Brit -
tany Lombardi also had a good game, 
leading the match with 33 digs, a sea -
son high for UCSD. Setter Heidi Sierks 
posted a double-double with 56 assists 
and 16 digs.
 With the wins, the Tritons improve 
to 22–3 overall and 14–3 in the CCAA.
