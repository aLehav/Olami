UCSD to lead $50.5 mil -
lion endeavor to improve 
computing efficiency

UC San Diego is stepping up 
to lead a coalition of 10 universi -
ties on a mission to improve the 
speed and accuracy of comput -
ing orders. Computer science 
professor Tajana Simunic-Rosing 
and her team of researchers will 
work toward developing a Pro -
cessing with Intelligent Storage 
and Memory center (PRISM). A 
$35 million grant from the Semi -
conductor Research Corporation 
in conjunction with combined 
funds from the involved universi -
ties will make up the $50.5 mil -
lion in funding for the project. 
/T_he PRISM Center’s website 
includes a more in-depth over -
view of the faculty involved, the 
funding that has been raised, and 
the team’s research plan. Among 
this information is a technical 
breakdown of tasks and long-
term goals.  
“PRISM will blur rigid bound -
aries between hardware and so/f_t -
ware to enable /f_lexible cross-layer 
co-optimizations while making 
these changes transparent to the 
application designer … By radi -
cally re-architecting memory and 
storage to enable new computing 
functionalities for improved en -
ergy eﬃciency and performance, 
PRISM will achieve near ‘speed-
of-light computing.’” 
/T_he center will focus on four 
key components: novel memory 
storage devices and circuits, next-
generation architecture, systems 
and so/f_tware, and grand chal -
lenge applications. Currently, 
modern computer systems spend 
as much as 90% of their time 
transferring information between 
memory and processors. Profes -
sor Simunic-Rosing and her team 
are aiming to create new so/f_tware 
and chip architectures to improve 
eﬃciency. 
“We will build the hardware 
and so/f_tware that will make sense 
of all the data that we generate to -
day–quickly and accurately,” Ros -
ing said in an interview with UC 
San Diego Today.
Between the San Diego Super -
computer Center, the Halicioglu 
Data Science Institute, and the 
Jacobs School of Engineering, 
UCSD’s expansive computer en -
gineering infrastructure makes 
it a well-equipped leader in this 
project. 
Further, one of the grand chal -
lenge applications of the center’s 
work is “personalized and secure 
drug development and study.”

January Pacific Storms Cause Significant De -
struction and Safety Concerns in San Diego 
By MEHRI SADRI /gid00004/gid00016/gid00015/gid00021/gid00019/gid00010/gid00003/gid00022/gid00021/gid00010/gid00015/gid00008/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
Southern California recently experienced a Pa -
ci/f_ic storm categorized by heavy rainfall and 
/f_looding across the region during the /f_irst 
weeks of 2023, and San Diegans all across the County 
have felt its impacts. 
/T_he San Diego coastal region has been subject to 
extreme weather conditions from the storm’s pas -
sage. During the week of Jan. 9, a High Surf Advi -
sory was issued for beach-goers, due to large waves 
that reached up to 20 feet and strong rip currents that 
could easily trap even experienced surfers. Addition -
ally, a Small Cra/f_t Advisory for small boats was an -
nounced because of the imminent safety risks while 
operating such vehicles in harsh conditions. Despite 
warnings, there have been several rescue missions to 
save surfers from volatile waters; on the /f_irst Friday of 
January, rip current rescues were reported at La Jolla 
beaches near Windansea and La Jolla Cove, leading 
to crucial lifeguard intervention.
Such extreme weather conditions likely led to the 
collapse of a bluﬀ south of Gliderport on the a/f_ter -
noon of Friday, Jan. 20. Videos from witnesses show 
the dramatic collapse creating an indent in the land 
below and an upward explosion of cliﬀ rocks. In addi -
tion to this land impact, the bluﬀ’s falling partitioned 
the coastal land that otherwise stretches from Tor -
rey Pines State Beach to Black’s Beach, splitting the 
region in half. Such destruction was unprecedented 
to locals, with witnesses at the beach reporting that 
the collapse occurred gradually. Currently, witnesses 
report that the bluﬀ still looks like it is shi/f_ting down -
wards; onlookers observe that some of the perched 
bluﬀ’s regions look like they could fall at any time. 
/T_hough the exact cause of the bluﬀ’s collapse is 
not yet con/f_irmed, various geological teams have 
been sent to the destruction site to determine the 
necessary precautions to keep the area safe. One 
geologist for the City of San Diego, Mike Jensen, 
hypothesizes that the intense rain coming onto the 
cliﬀ during the storm weighed the landform down as 
large incoming waves crashed into the cliﬀ. Because 
the slide has not yet become stagnant, experts advise 
beachgoers to stay away from the bluﬀ’s bottom.
/T_he La Jolla area is not the only beach region that 
was aﬀected by the storm. Large waves reaching up to 
12 feet caused damage to the Ocean Beach Pier dur -ing the /f_irst week of January — a region that  faced 
prior damage in 2022 due to high surf. In addition to 
high waves, the area experienced some /f_looding, as 
high tides /f_looded blocked-oﬀ areas and residential 
roads alongside the coast. Other public beach areas 
in San Diego that reported high wave and /f_looding 
dangers included Imperial Beach and Mission Beach. 
/T_he recent back-to-back storms have caused an 
in/f_lux in San Diego’s greenery, but not without its 
dangers. /T_he January showers and strong winds have 
caused massive mountain snow, /f_looded roadways, 
power outages, and wildlife destruction. Mass /f_lood -
ing was reported during the week of Jan. 16 along the 
San Diego River, encompassing the Fashion Valley 
and Mission Valley areas. Along with the river, resi -
dential roads and heavy-traﬃc roads such as Fashion 
Valley Road, Camino De La Reina, Mission Center 
Road, and others have been struck by the /f_loods. 
/T_hough wind and /f_lood advisory warnings were 
issued by forecasters, there have been at least two 
water rescues during the storm season from vehicles 
being trapped in the rising /f_lows. Additionally, San 
Diego Fire-Rescue Lifeguards aided a group of seven 
individuals who became stuck on a piece of land and 
volatile waters near the Interstate 5 and I-8 freeways. 
/T_hough /f_ire-rescue lifeguards were able to rescue  
/f_ive individuals, the two remaining were saved by 
boat. Additionally, in Southern San Diego County, 
residents and onlookers reported /f_looding along the 
Tijuana River, trapping a driver’s vehicle in four feet 
of water, requiring water rescue crew intervention 
using a life ra/f_t.
/T_hough record amounts of rainfall were seen 
throughout California, such high surf conditions are 
not exclusively seen during rainstorms. 
San Diego State University’s Department of Geo -
logical Sciences Professor Pat Abbott explained the 
connection to storms of this magnitude with winter. 
“/T_here is a higher sea level than there used to be, but 
not that much. /T_he main thing we are seeing right 
now is the seasonal change,” Abbott said. “Come 
wintertime, we get bigger waves, less sand on the 
beach, and we get the highest tides of the year.”
Such diminishing sand levels coupled with prob -
lematic weather conditions are aﬀecting the beach

Standardize Syllabi
By BENJAMIN LIOU
/gid00020/gid00006/gid00015/gid00010/gid00016/gid00019/gid00001/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
Syllabi should be standardized 
to help students focus on learning 
and not logistics.
When students enter the job 
market, they are expected to have 
a resume. Machines and HR staﬀ 
then /f_ilter through the heaps of re -
sumes to /f_ind the ideal candidates 
for an interview. /T_his is to ensure 
that the job market is competi -
tive and that hired employees are 
well-suited for the job. Similarly, 
students need to make choices 
when enrolling in courses, and 
the syllabus is akin to the resume. 
/T_he syllabus should be there to 
help students decide whether they 
want to take a course by providing 
information on what the student 
will learn, course load, grading 
scheme, contacts, and course poli -
cies.
One reason a student may 
need to take a class is that it is re -
quired for their major or college. 
Even for required courses, stu -
dents o/f_ten need to decide when 
to take them and which professor 
to choose. /T_herefore, the sylla -
bus is important in guiding stu -
dents through their college career. 
However, my current observation 
is that students rely heavily on 
word-of-mouth and websites like 
ratemyprofessors.com. Syllabi are 
not used as much, making the 
process of enrolling in the right 
course ineﬃcient. /T_he number 
of course adds and drops in the 
/f_irst four weeks of a quarter are 
testament to this ineﬃciency. If 
students picked the right course 
in the /f_irst place, they would have 
stuck with it, allowing them to fo -
cus and learn better.
It can be hard for waitlisted students to be kept hanging while 
being reluctant about committing 
too many resources to a course 
they might not get into, meaning 
they likely won’t study as hard or 
attend classes as o/f_ten. Meanwhile, 
someone else is hogging the spot 
but also commits fewer resources 
because they are thinking of drop -
ping. /T_his results in both students 
learning less eﬃciently and more 
work for the TA to keep track of 
students’ attendance and learning 
progress.
So why aren’t syllabi used as 
much as they should be? Because 
non-standardized syllabi are too 
diﬃcult for students to read thor -
oughly, harder to compare with 
other course syllabi to make an 
informed decision, and also too 
much work for professors to write 
and publish timely, giving stu -
dents a lag in information.
I examined the syllabi of the 
40 courses I’ve taken at UC San 
Diego from Fall 2020 to Fall 2022 
and calculated an average of just 
above four grading categories. For 
example: 25% homework, 30% 
quizzes, 30% project, and a 15% 
/f_inal would have four grading cat -
egories. /T_hat’s all /f_ine, but on the 
other hand, some of my classes 
have up to eight grading cat -
egories. Some also have unwieldy 
grade breakdowns like 21% home -
work, 5% project, 28% midterms, 
46% /f_inal — percentages that are 
not the usual multiples of 5% or 
10%.
It doesn’t help that the format 
of syllabi are non-standardized. 
/T_he grading section can be at the 
beginning, middle, or end of a 
long document. It can also be in a 
chart, written like a paragraph, or 
spread throughout the document.
/T_hese overcomplicated grad -ing schemes and syllabus layouts 
take the emphasis away from 
learning and put students who 
know the content but aren’t so 
good at keeping track of assign -
ments or don’t have the ability to 
do everything that is required, at 
an unfair disadvantage. Not every -
one can get that 7% lecture atten -
dance point or keep track of many 
tiny weekly assignments, perhaps 
because they have work or fam -
ily commitments. It also burdens 
the teaching staﬀ with a bombard -
ment of grading questions, as of -
ten seen on Piazza. /T_his is ironic 
since the syllabus is supposed to 
clarify things, but instead gener -
ates more questions, even a/f_ter 
professors belatedly tell students 
“It’s in the syllabus. ”
/T_hat’s because there’s a problem 
with the syllabus. Some syllabi are 
so detailed that reading it is a huge 
turn-oﬀ to students, and the time 
spent scrutinizing the syllabus 
would be better spent simply ask -
ing on Piazza. On the other hand, 
some syllabi are written unclearly. 
In one of my past syllabi, the grad -
ing scheme wasn’t even speci/f_ied. 
Also, syllabi are o/f_ten unavailable 
until the /f_irst day of class, or even 
later, which causes confusion and 
a /f_lood of questions. I suspect the 
reason why many syllabi are un -
available is that it’s a lot of work 
for the professors and TAs to dra/f_t 
or update a syllabus.
/T_herefore, I propose that syl -
labi be standardized, with simpli -
/f_ied grading schemes and logistic 
policies, such that syllabi can be 
available before classes start, so 
that students may choose the right 
course and have the time to famil -
iarize themselves with the course.

Reflecting on Theodor Geisel’s 
Rhymes and Racism
By EUNICE KIM
/gid00007/gid00006/gid00002/gid00021/gid00022/gid00019/gid00006/gid00020/gid00001/gid00004/gid00016/gid00183/gid00006/gid00005/gid00010/gid00021/gid00016/gid00019
Geisel Library is a de/f_ining 
point of UC San Diego’s campus, 
a reminder of what the univer -
sity stands for as a public research 
university, and a reliable resource 
for students and visitors alike. For 
some guests, it is the /f_irst place 
they want to visit and for many 
students, it’s the last place they stop 
at before they go home for the day. 
Upon further examination, the ab -
stract building resembles nurturing 
hands holding up and cradling a 
stack of books. 
/T_his makes sense as the name 
of the library honors Audrey and 
/T_heodor Geisel, the latter of whom 
is the famous author of children’s 
books such as “/T_he Cat in the Hat” 
and “/T_he Lorax. ” Audrey’s Cafe on 
the second /f_loor and outside of the 
library, along with  a bronze statue 
of a /T_heodor Geisel seated at his 
work desk with the Cat in the Hat 
standing by his side, honor the two 
donors. Geisel is better known by 
his aﬀectionate and well-known 
pen name: Dr. Seuss. Now, it is a 
household name with many indi -
viduals wistful for the rhyming sto -
ries of their youth that paired with 
sweet images of anthropomorphic 
animals. 
/T_he second /f_loor also holds the 
“Special Collections and Archives” 
area and a permanent display near 
the Seuss Room, containing  be -
loved glass displays of thousands 
of his manuscripts, art works, rudi -mentary designs, original pieces, 
and other older relics. Nearby 
is the Seuss Room where events 
such as the New Writing Series 
readings from poets and authors 
take place. Perhaps a curious 
thing is what exactly made the 
vibrant author a potential can -
didate for the university library’s 
name. A/f_ter all, the library was 
not always connected to the 
Geisel family.
/T_he answer may be in the em -
phasis on literacy and education, 
both of which Audrey and /T_he -
odor Geisel supported.
Audrey Geisel — who was 
married to /T_heodor Geisel — do -
nated $20 million to the UCSD 
library along with many of her 
husband’s original works in 1995, 
as he passed away just four years 
prior. Both of them were La Jolla 
residents. /T_hus, UCSD’s Central 
Library was renamed Geisel Li -
brary. 
Still, /T_heodor Geisel’s proli/f_ic 
writing history also unveiled rac -
ist depictions and stereotypes 
from his trove of children’s books 
as well as improper political 
comics. /T_he focus is not on his 
apologies, as it is known that he 
has since expressed remorse — 
genuine or not. /T_hough people 
are capable of change, they  still 
must reap the consequences of 
their actions. 
Some students on campus are 
aware of Geisel’s past and aren’t 
willing to let bygones be bygones. 
His legacy is made permanent in 
the life-sized bronze statue of /T_heodor Geisel, something that 
seems out of place when consider -
ing the parts of his personal his -
tory that were not fair and kind to 
others. Sometimes, they were just 
cruel. 
Philip Nel wrote “Was the Cat 
in the Hat Black? /T_he Hidden 
Racism of Children’s Literature, 
and the Need for Diverse Books. ” 
Nel is one of many who believe 
that the “Cat in the Hat”  is an 
allusion to blackface minstrelsy, 
but understanding this refer -
ence could easily be overlooked 
in young children’s books. Oth -
ers liken“Horton Hears a Who” 
to white-saviorism, while defend -
ers of Geisel say that he was being 
civil and welcoming of everyone 
in the story. /T_here is no doubt that 
further analyses of Geisel bring 
forward pressing concerns about 
his intentions while writing, even 
if the result was a colorful, witty 
children’s book. 
/T_here is also the concern that 
cutting out works of an author 
compromises the cultural integ -
rity of the works.“ And To /T_hink 
/T_hat I Saw It On Mulberry Street” 
was Seuss’ /f_irst children’s book. 
/T_he Seuss estate said that they 
would stop selling the book, along 
with six other ones as they deemed 
them oﬀensive back in early 2021, 
which instead led to an increase in 
sales. Solutions to inappropriate 
wording or imagery include self-
editing, in which authors tweak 
later copies of their works. But 
such eﬀorts would be posthumous 
which may further compromise Geisel’s works, though some im -
agery had already been replaced 
by him in the the 70s when  he 
expressed remorse for past works.
Perhaps by completely remov -
ing certain books that are deemed 
inappropriate, though, the audi -
ence isn’t able to appreciate a ho -
listic understanding of the author 
as well as their wrongdoings. /T_hey 
may not be able to come to their 
own understanding of the book. 
/T_he audience may discern the au -
thor’s sentiments in context of the 
time period when they are reading 
the book.
According to NBC News, 
some of Dr Seuss’ books eluded 
criticism until recently because of 
anti-Asian racism in the U.S. since 
the 1800s and how symbolic Seuss’ 
books are of American childhood. 
/T_he book “ And To /T_hink /T_hat I 
Saw It On Mulberry Street” was 
/f_irst published in 1937. Nel does 
not acknowledge or defend Geisel 
as a “man of his time, ” stating that 
there were others who didn’t cre -
ate racist works like Geisel. 
But Dr. Seuss is a household 
name. He’s sold millions of copies 
of his books and donated gener -
ously during his life. His books 
warmed many children’s hearts, 
and many who read them failed to 
discern their racist undertones.
Geisel’s birthday is March 2, 
and celebrations will be on the 
rise with recognition of his color -
ful characters like /T_hing 1, /T_hing 
2, the Lorax, and the Cat in the 
Hat. But there are also many in the 
UCSD community who remain bitter with his history and the in -
/f_luence his prejudicial thoughts 
have had on his artwork and per -
sonal stances — regardless of any 
apology made down the line. 
Some look at Geisel’s statue and 
name in distaste because of how 
intransient his legacy seems to be 
and how much of it is a reminder 
of the past — the incredibly good 
and the incredibly discom/f_iting. 
Perhaps it’s not that atonement 
doesn’t exist for historical /f_igures 
but that some consequences linger 
in the most innocuous of areas 
and need not be forgotten.

What’s it Like to Take 22 Units and Still Have a Social Life?
By BENJAMIN LOU
/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
People are o/f_ten surprised 
when I tell them I’m taking 22 
units this quarter. It’s hard, but it’s 
not that uncommon. Go on UCSD 
Reddit, and you’ll see people hav -
ing taken 20, 22, 28 … 32 … 70?! 
To be honest, I kind of doubt the 
70, but I can be completely honest 
with you that I’ve taken 26 units 
before and survived with good 
grades.
So, I’m taking 22 units this 
quarter and it’s not the /f_irst time. 
But, what if I told you I’m taking 
ECE 103, ECE 111, ECE 172a, 
ECE 198, JAPN 130B, and COGS 
108? Y ep, all upper divs, and four 
of them are engineering courses. 
And on top of that, I’m a Japanese 
Student Association staﬀ member 
and writer for /T_he UCSD Guard -
ian. And on top of that, I go to 
Eta Kappa Nu and Tau Beta Pi 
events, including teaching at local 
schools, and also have to plan for 
studying abroad next quarter.
So how do I do it? Or rather, 
how am I not completely burned 
out and socially dead?
Y ou may ask how many hours 
of sleep do I get? Around seven 
and a half.
Do I drink coﬀee? No.
Do I game? No. /T_hat gives me 
an extra hour or two of sleep than 
if I chose to game.
Do I work out? Not in the gym, 
but if you consider running uphill 
from Pepper Canyon Hall to Sixth 
College a workout, then yes.
Do I socialize? Well, I do chat with people in my class, attend 
and plan student org events, and 
have dinner with friends when 
I have time. But no clubbing or 
anything crazy like that, though I 
might go to a karaoke or two.
It’s all about tradeoﬀs. It’s also 
about not only doing what you 
enjoy, but enjoying what you do, 
and choosing activities wisely to 
maximize utility. /T_here are always 
things that you have to do that you 
might not enjoy: chores, HUM, 
and commuting. In this case, you 
don’t have a choice whether you 
want to do it or not. /T_he only 
choice you have is whether to 
make it productive and enjoyable.
For example, I have to get 
from class A to class B. When I 
run, I save time to ask the profes -
sor some extra questions. I also 
get my daily workout, a runner’s 
high, and in turn don’t have to 
spend an “extra” hour in the gym 
(I o/f_ten run several times a day so 
it adds up). Now instead of using 
that extra hour to game, I use it to 
do homework, which I have to do 
anyway, thus preserving my extra 
hour. Ultimately, I choose to use 
it towards dinner with a friend, 
studying solo, or sleeping, which 
are things I /f_ind inherently enjoy -
able and bene/f_icial.
But it’s not that simple. Some -
times I wonder whether I don’t 
feel socially dead because my so -
cialization standards are lower 
than others. I wonder whether I’m 
actually socializing far less than 
my peers, and that I might regret 
later that I didn’t socialize enough 
in college, just as I kind of regret 
how I didn’t socialize enough in high school. But then one may 
also argue that everyone has dif -
ferent needs, and it’s ok for some 
to socialize less than others.
So here I am balancing 22 
units, a bunch of extracurriculars, 
and a social life that I’m doubt -
fully content with. What should 
I do? Shi/f_t the equilibrium to -
wards socialization at the expense 
of grades and club responsibili -
ties? I’m pushing my limits, and 
the quest for more makes me ask 
questions. What is the meaning of 
all of this, and what is the end goal, 
if any? Do I want to be happy? If 
so, I could theoretically simply 
lower my happiness threshold to 
the point of feeling ecstasy at the 
littlest things in life, like walking ponder about the meaning of life.
So, what’s it like to take 22 
units? Perhaps very similar to 
what it’s like for you to take 16 
or 12 units, though you may pri -
oritize other things like work or 
family. Would I say I still have a 
social life? I’ d like to say yes, and 
when I say yes, I’ d like to think it 
means yes. Meanwhile, I’ll work 
to increase my productivity, allow 
myself to be happy with the littlest 
things, and remind myself to so -
cialize as much as I can. Perhaps a 
positive attitude is the key to suc -
cess. What do you think?

out of my dorm to see a clear blue 
sky. But maybe we can’t be happy 
once we know we can have more. 
Or do I want to be productive and 
help the people around me? Or do 
I want to ful/f_ill a sense of pride to 
justify my existence in this world?
When taking 22 units, I o/f_ten 
lose track of my life goals, simply 
trudging through everyday exis -
tence and hanging on tight. But 
once I stop and think, I realize that 
I don’t even have a solid idea of my 
own existence. Perhaps we are all 
similar, the diﬀerences being what 
we prioritize and how we allocate 
resources. From star athletes to 
self-proclaimed “average” people, 
we all march through our daily 
lives, stopping once in a while to 6 /T.cap/H.cap/E.cap /U.cap/C.cap/S.cap/D.cap /G.cap/U.cap/A.cap/R.cap/D.cap/I.cap/A.cap/N.cap | /M.cap/O.cap/N.cap/D.cap/A.cap/Y.cap, /J.cap/A.cap/N.cap/U.cap/A.cap/R.cap/Y.cap 30, 2023 | /W.cap/W.cap/W.cap./U.cap/C.cap/S.cap/D.cap/G.cap/U.cap/A.cap/R.cap/D.cap/I.cap/A.cap/N.cap./O.cap/R.cap/G.cap  LIFESTYLE
My Experience Going to Tết San Diego
By ROSABELLA DEBTY
/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
“Chúc m/uni1EEBng năm m/uni1EDBi!” Or, 
wish happy year new (as my friend 
translated to me). /T_his past week 
Mira Mesa hosted its annual T/uni1EBFt 
festival, a huge festival originat -
ing in Vietnam for /T_he Lunar 
New Y ear. My friend participated 
in the Miss Vietnam pageant, and 
because my last article was about 
New Y ear’s, I wanted to follow 
the same vein and talk about my 
experience at the festival and the 
pageant itself. 
First of all, it was on the small -
er side. I hear that T/uni1EBFt in O.C. is 
huge, because there is a higher 
Vietnamese population there, but 
even though it was small, I found 
there wasere a good bit of things 
to do. It reminded me of a small 
county fair, the abnormally cold 
night bringing back memories 
of fall festivals in October where 
your nose burns from the cold, but 
you don’t want to leave just yet. I 
got there a little later in the night 
so I didn’t ride any of the rides, 
but they seemed pretty standard 
— a tilt-a-whirl, a swing one, and 
a carousel. /T_here was a handful 
of games, as well, but again, I was 
honestly just making sure I could 
secure a good place for the pag -
eant, and unfortunately, there was 
no balloon pop (I have a mean aim 
at balloon pop — but ring toss, not 
so much). 
/T_hey might have only had a 
small selection of rides and games, 
but they really shined with the 
food. /T_here were so many stalls 
that it was kind of overwhelm -
ing. My constraints were time and 
funds, which narrowed it down a 
little bit. I got Bulgogi-loaded fries, 
but only a/f_ter debating if I should 
get a Korean corn dog, teriyaki on 
a stick, or ribbon potatoes (I feel 
like stick food is essential, okay?). 
/T_he fries were perfectly crispy and 
golden, and the meat was surpris -
ingly well cooked — I say surpris -
ingly because I don’t expect ribeye 
bulgogi at a festival stall to taste 
like I got it fresh out of the kitch -
en. /T_hey were lean cuts of meat 
and not chewy at all. /T_hey also put this special sauce over it —– I 
couldn’t tell you the name, but it 
reminded me a little of yum-yum 
sauce with maybe a little more of a 
chili taste. Either way, I was de/f_i -
nitely satis/f_ied with the food, and 
my only qualm is that I wasn’t able 
to try more.
Before the pageant, they had 
the legendary lion dance by a lo -
cal line dancing team. With mul -
tiple diﬀerent dances and sto -
rylines, there was something for 
everyone. /T_he most impressive 
one to me was this one where in -
stead of the dancer performing on 
the stage, they danced on metal 
poles only wide enough to sup -
port their hands and feet. As they 
moved back and forth, on all fours 
along with just their hind legs, 
I found myself in awe. It looked 
so natural, and when the head of 
a dragon suit can weigh upwards 
of 40 pounds, it’s hard to not be 
impressed. Again, because I was 
late, I didn’t get to see the whole 
dance. However, I saw the /f_inale 
where they brought four dragons 
on stage that dissipated a little into 
the crowd before the lights cut oﬀ 
and they le/f_t the area, almost as 
if they were never there to begin 
with. 
By this point, I found a pretty 
good seat a few rows back from 
the stage, and the crowd was 
growing with anticipation by the 
second. /T_he two emcees came 
out a/f_ter about /f_ive minutes, and 
then suddenly we were all in the 
swing of things. To start the pag -
eant, all of the 10 /f_inalists danced 
to a song wearing the same áo dài. 
/T_hey each introduced themselves 
with either a fun fact about them -
selves, why they wanted to com -
pete in the pageant, or what they 
would hope to change if they were 
crowned. During each break, there 
was a singing act. Vietnamese art -
ists Loan Châu and Lương Tùng 
Quang each performed twice. 
While I wasn’t familiar with their 
music, the rhythm and musical 
instruments used dated the songs 
to around the 90s and the 2000s. 
Loan Châu’s music in particular 
felt like it had a bit of Latinx in -
/f_luence, with the rhythm of the 
drums and the tempo of the string 
instruments, while Lương Tùng Quang was de/f_initely the Justin 
Timberlake of his era. It was actu -
ally sweet because you could tell 
the older generations must have 
listened to them a lot, so I can just 
imagine how it felt to see them live 
in action.
One of the cool things about 
the festival was that they were very 
intentional with making sure ev -
eryone was included. /T_hey spoke 
in both Vietnamese and English, 
sometimes translating and some -
times not. /T_here were times I 
didn’t really know what they were 
saying, but it was one of those 
situations where you could tell 
by their expressions, the way they 
would pause or the crowd would 
acknowledge them in a certain 
way, that made it feel like I could 
still understand them. It wasn’t 
just the people who hosted it that 
were inclusive, I openly chatted 
with the people around me. /T_hey 
asked if I understood what was 
being said. When I said no, they would help. When cheering for 
my friend, they would join in or 
compliment her, and I would do 
the same for the contestant they 
knew. It felt very communal, and 
sometimes emotional, because 
you could   really feel how strong 
their pride was for their culture 
and community. I teared up at 
some of the contestants’ respons -
es, and one that stuck with me was 
actually said by the girl who won 
the pageant. She was asked what 
makes Vietnamese and Vietnam -
ese Americans diﬀerent, and how 
those two cultures could come 
together, and her story was really 
moving. She talked about the fall 
of Saigon, and her parents immi -
grating to a foreign country for 
refuge where they didn’t know the 
language, the customs, or anyone 
here but themselves. How she was 
raised to feel pride in her culture, 
and how that diﬀerentiates the 
two; because of her parents’ sac -
ri/f_ice, she is able to have many privileges she might have not had 
in Vietnam, yet she was still able 
to feel pride for her people.
/T_his was my /f_irst time going to 
T/uni1EBFt, and while I had expected to 
not be fully immersed in the ex -
perience, whether due to language 
and cultural barriers or not going 
with anyone besides my friend 
who was practicing for the pag -
eant, I le/f_t feeling embraced and 
even more interested in the rich 
Vietnamese culture. While you 
will have to wait a whole other 
year to be able to go, I recommend 
seeing if T/uni1EBFt is hosted in your area 
when the time comes. And with 
that, I leave with this: even though 
I felt like I was slowly becoming 
an iceberg with the cold night 
air, it was the warmth of celebrat -
ing with loved ones, hearing the 
cheering fans of each contestant, 
and the smell of street food that 
made it all worthwhile.

HECTOR ARRIETA
“Are you ready to /f_ind love?” 
It’s a question many of us might 
have asked ourselves, or have had 
dating apps ask when signing up. 
No matter how you might have 
been asked, I’m sure many have 
not been asked this question by 
host Jesse Palmer while standing 
in front of a mansion waiting for 
30 beautiful women to meet you. 
If on the oﬀ chance you have, con -
gratulations! You have one thing 
in common with Zach Shallcross, 
this season’s Bachelor. Shallcross’ 
season premiere as the Bachelor 
last Monday night was no excep -
tion to these Bachelor precursors. 
On Jan. 25, Season 27 of ABC’s 
“/T_he Bachelor” premiered, invit -
ing us to share Shallcross’ journey 
to /f_inding love. In the season pre -
miere, we were introduced to 30 
women all vying for Shallcross’ 
heart and a chance to leave the 
Santa Monica mountains of Mal -
ibu engaged. 
At the beginning of the epi -
sode, Jesse Palmer turns to the 
camera and states, “You may think 
you know Zach…”, even though 
I’ve never claimed to know Zach. 
However, I found myself wonder -ing, “Do I know Zach?” Myself 
and anyone watching know the 
basics about him. He’s tall, attrac -
tive, ready to /f_ind love, and loves 
family, football, and frozen pizza. 
We do get to learn that Shall -
cross has some musical abilities 
as Palmer tells us about his past 
as a bassist in a band back in high 
school and his stint as a DJ in col -
lege. It’s clear that we will get to 
learn more about Shallcross as 
the season progresses. Luckily, 
/T_he UCSD Guardian had the op -
portunity to interview him about 
the season premiere and what’s to 
come next this season. 
Before Shallcross suited up to 
meet the women he would be dat -
ing for the next six weeks, he met 
up with Bachelor alum Sean Lowe 
to receive some wisdom from his 
experiences on the show. When 
asked how Sean’s advice helped 
him navigate the /f_irst night, 
Shallcross said, “Sean had some 
great advice. We joked around 
and had a great time leading up 
to night one. But what was the 
most important thing other than 
his support was his advice [to] 
not take myself too seriously. You 
know I have all these thoughts of 
what I expect night one to be and 
… the nerves of thinking ‘Can I 
do this?’ and ‘Am I supposed to Exclusive Interview: Zach Shallcross 
from “The Bachelor”

you are supposed to be here. Be 
yourself and have fun with it and 
don’t take it too seriously because 
you’re gonna make it miserable 
for yourself if you’re always in 
your head. So that was the best 
piece of advice.” 
Fans of /T_he Bachelor series 
know Shallcross previously from 
Rachel Recchia and Gabby Wind -
ey’s season of “/T_he Bachelorette.” 
Shallcross was one of the /f_inal 
contestants who made it all the 
way to fantasy suites with Rachel 
before leaving the show. 
He feels his experience on 
“/T_he Bachelorette” and being 
emotionally vulnerable in front of 
the cameras prepared him for his 
journey as the Bachelor.
“I think what was really im -
portant with that whole season of 
“/T_he Bachelorette” was kinda get -
ting used to the cameras which 
is kinda a crazy thought for a lot 
of people,” Shallcross said. “I was 
terri/f_ied going into ‘/T_he Bachelor -
ette’... I have to open up emotion -
ally and be vulnerable in front of 
cameras. A/f_ter some time … you 
kinda get used to it and you real -
ize they’re just cameras, it’s not 
really like a person or anything 
judging you. /T_hat really helped 
me going into ‘/T_he Bachelor.’ Since I know what I want, I’m not 
going to wall myself up because 
there’s a camera here, and just 
having that experience with the 
camera helped.” 
/T_he cameras are undoubt -
edly a looming presence over the 
mansion as they capture the ro -
mance and drama of night one as 
we are introduced to the women, 
who all have the goal of stealing 
Shallcross’ heart. /T_he women in -
clude Christina, a single mom 
and content creator; Brianna, an 
entrepreneur and America’s /f_irst 
impression rose winner; Greer, 
a medical sales rep who received 
the /f_irst impression rose from 
Shallcross; and Mercedes, a non -
pro/f_it owner who showed up with 
her pet pig Henry, who Shallcross 
named his favorite intro of the 
night saying, “I’m gonna say, and 
I’ve been saying it, I love a good 
farm animal. I thought Henry the 
pig was my favorite entrance.” 
Shallcross’ dance skills were 
tested when Madison, a busi -
ness owner from South Dakota 
who had Shallcross drink maple 
syrup when they met, pulled him 
aside to teach him the viral dance 
called the griddy. When asked if 
we will see any more viral dances 
from him this season Shallcross 
said, “Oh God, I hope not. /T_here’s always gonna be some dancing. 
Will they be viral, griddy-like? 
Not to my memory or at least I 
hope not. I know my griddy needs 
work.” 
You might be wondering what 
made Shallcross take a chance at 
/f_inding love as the bachelor a/f_ter 
he le/f_t “/T_he Bachelorette.” When 
asked why he chose to come back, 
he said, “It was months of conver -
sations and hesitations on both 
sides. It came down to the point 
of I know what I want, I’m ready 
to /f_ind my person, show or not. I 
know it was an interesting experi -
ence for me last season, but I am 
hopeful [love] is still out there. I 
have faith in the process ‘cause I 
lived it. I mean what an opportu -
nity.” 
What should we expect from 
this next episode? According to 
Shallcross, it’s a lot of fun. “It’s 
the /f_irst time we’re doing group 
dates. It’s the /f_irst one-on-one of 
the season. We have some special 
guests that are making some en -
trances on this date, so they’re a 
little unique in style. I don’t think 
there’s been a date like this be -
fore,” Shallcross said. 
Season 27 of “/T_he Bachelor” 
airs Mondays at 8 p.m. on ABC. 
Episodes will be available on Hulu 
the day following their premieres.BY Kamiah Johnson

RIDES ON DEMANDA.S. Safe Rides X Lyft
A.S. Safe Rides is back for Fall Quarter with $12 oﬀ 2 rides.
New expanded boundaries for farther rides!
Visit as.ucsd.edu/saferides for redemption details and restrictions.Before I begin, I have to be 
honest about the fact that I am 
not a critical watcher of mov -
ies. Like many, I /f_ind cinema 
as purely a means of escapism. 
I don’t spend my time picking 
apart camera shots or the direc -
tor’s choices despite the fact that 
they would enhance my experi -
ence or strengthen my takeaways. 
Likewise, part of the appeal in de -
ciding to see “Puss in Boots: /T_he 
Last Wish” was that it seemed 
to be a vessel of pure escapism. 
I wouldn’t feel guilty for not ab -
sorbing any subliminal messages 
because children’s movies usually 
do the heavy li/f_ting when it comes 
to explaining their overarching 
ideas. “Puss in Boots” took on 
this burden graciously, creating 
a captivating storyline, loveable 
characters, and beautiful themes 
all buoyed by stunning anima -
tion. My friend and I both walked 
into the theater expecting noth -
ing but a fun little kid’s movie, but 
we walked out surprised by how 
touched we felt. 
Everyone is familiar with the 
beloved Puss in Boots — as he 
boasts himself within the opening 
sequence — he’s a legend larger 
than life. /T_he scrappy orange fe -
line voiced by Antonio Banderas 
was introduced in “Shrek 2.” He 
was given both a spin-oﬀ movie 
and a television show that kept 
the character on the public radar 
and solidi/f_ied him on the roster of 
notable DreamWorks characters. 
Over 10 years a/f_ter his /f_irst solo /f_ilm, “/T_he Last Wish” arrived as a 
sequel. However, as someone who 
went into the movie without any 
real prior knowledge of the char -
acter, I can attest to the fact that 
the /f_irst movie is not necessary for 
following the sequel. 
/T_he plot centers around Puss 
realizing he is down to the last 
of his nine lives, and while he 
initially dismisses this, he is con -
fronted with one of the most ter -
rifying villains I have ever seen in 
a children’s movie: Death (Wag -
ner Moura) personi/f_ied as a wolf. 
/T_heir interaction scares Puss into 
hiding where he undergoes an 
identity crisis in the security of 
a crazy cat lady’s home. It’s here 
that a secondary group of vil -
lains, Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) 
and the three bears, destroy the 
house Puss is hiding in to search 
for him. /T_he bandits want to hire 
him to steal a map of the Wishing

be vulnerable with someone. Per -
rito, the nickname Puss has given 
to his once-nameless friend, is 
the opposite of So/f_tpaws. He is 
incredibly vulnerable and sees 
the good in everyone around 
him even when doing so harms 
him. He comes across as rather 
dense when describing past-mal -
treatment as fun and games, but 
shaping the world into pure good 
is arguably harder than succumb -
ing to cynicism; there is admira -
tion to be found in his naivety. 
Puss is initially reluctant to be ac -
companied by So/f_tpaws and Per -
rito for the risk that they uncover 
the messy personality beneath 
the legend. Puss’s Achilles heel is 
made rather obvious: his ego and 
desire to maintain the legendary 
status that takes up so much space 
in his heart that there’s little room 
for everything else. But, in jour -
neying with So/f_tpaws and Perrito, 
he /f_inds himself opening up and 
feeling more relieved every time 
he does. Choosing to let himself 
be known and letting others put 
their faith in him is enough to give 
him a new perspective. /T_hey’re all 
searching for something: to mend 
the wounds of their pasts and en -
sure a secure and brighter future, 
and this is done by allowing oth -
ers to help shoulder these tasks. 
Sure, Puss is down to his last life, 
but letting people love him in this 
one is all that he’ll ever need. 
Despite there being many an -
tagonists, the plotline manages 
to stay grounded when it could 
have easily dissolved into chaos. 
Each villain is well-rounded 
and straightforward when nec -essary, and all of them serve as 
foils to Puss in solidifying his 
/f_inal character arc. Goldilocks 
and the bears are a ragtag fam -
ily of bandits whose journey of 
appreciating one another comes 
full circle as Puss begins to love 
his chosen family. Death desires 
to be respected; he’s frustrated by 
how careless Puss has been with 
his past lives and seeks to end the 
last one as punishment for the 
disrespect. Puss, who has been 
running from him for the entire 
movie, eventually squares up to 
face him. Tired of running, he is 
willing to /f_ight for his loved ones 
and a newfound life. Jack Horner 
is simply an evil, spoiled, and de -
structive child, and defeating him 
requires Puss to shed his strict 
independence and cooperate with 
everyone around him.
“Puss in Boots: /T_he Last 
Wish” sticks its landing as it 
juggles sophistication, appealing 
to its target audience, and plot. 
While some jokes stick out as ex -
ceptionally childish and the /f_ilm 
occasionally defaults to slapstick 
humor, these are scenes that chil -
dren are meant to enjoy. Death and chosen family are two themes 
that the /f_ilm drives home. While 
a younger audience might simply 
be entertained by the vivid colors 
and /f_ights between a wolf with 
scythes and a cat with a sword, 
the movie manages to incorporate 
sophisticated messages. Family is 
who we choose to surround our -
selves with, and it is our respon -
sibility to learn how to appreciate 
those who choose to show up for 
us. Death is inevitable, and it is 
impossible to try and run from it. 
Instead of letting this be a para -
lyzing fear, we use this knowledge 
to be grateful for the life that we 
are gi/f_ted with and learn how to 
love more deeply. What’s more, 
life is meant to be shared. Life is 
most ful/f_illing when love is mu -
tually exchanged, and in Puss’s 
case, it gives him enough cour -
age to /f_ight Death one-on-one. 
Complete with an A-List cast and 
incredible animation, “Puss in 
Boots: /T_he Last Wish” is a great 
escapist movie for anyone with a 
couple of hours to spare. BY Jonathan Shlesinger

Editor’s Note: /T_he following 
review contains spoilers.
“But we are always optimists 
when it comes to time; we think 
there will be time to do things 
with other people. And time to say 
things to them. Time to appeal.” “A 
Man Called Ove,” Fredrick Back -
man.
Based on the 2012 novel “A 
Man Called Ove” by Fredrick 
Backman, “A Man Called Otto” 
follows the story of an old man 
who seems to hate everyone in 
the world and /f_inds everything 
a nuisance. Otto, played by Tom 
Hanks, lives in a quiet suburban 
neighborhood that is slowly be -
ing gentri/f_ied by pesky real estate 
agents and occupied by nosy new 
neighbors. /T_he /f_irst part of the 
movie is focused on Otto’s fruit -
less attempts to take his life a/f_ter 
his wife Sonya (Rachel Keller) 
passed six months prior. With his 
nitpicky daily chores and sudden 
outbursts about anything that 
could get in his way, Otto is dis -
liked by everyone around him. 
He is angry about rising prices, 
bikes parked next to gates instead 
of racks, and cars becoming too 
“easy” for drivers. One glance at 
this man gives more than enough 
evidence to make him the most dislikable character of the /f_ilm. 
Hanks delivers an amazing per -
formance as his role of a grumpy 
old man that we’ve all encoun -
tered at least once in our lives. 
As we learn more about Otto’s 
character through /f_lashbacks, we 
begin to realize that this was once 
a man full of happiness and hope. 
Otto was a husband and soon-to-
be father, married to a cheerful 
woman who brightened his world. 
Like any good man, he wanted 
the best for his growing family. 
/T_he /f_lashback scenes are brief and 
display the youthful romance be -
tween Otto and Sonya. We follow 
Otto in his /f_irst meeting with So -
nya, to him proposing to her af -
ter he graduates, to him painting 
a crib for their baby. While these 
scenes humanize Otto and show 
what his life once was, there are a 
few faults that make them almost 
unbearable to watch. When the 
tragedy that fell upon Otto and 
Sonya is revealed, there is one 
thing that seems to ruin the sup -
posedly tearful and heartbreak -
ing moments for the audience: 
the music. A tragic tale of a young 
couple losing their child before he 
is born is shattered by an un/f_it -
ting song playing a little too loud -
ly over the dialogue. A simple or -
chestral piece without any lyrics 
or vocals would have le/f_t behind 
the necessary impact of this par -
ticular moment. Moreover, the Movie Review: A Man Called Otto

the past felt rushed despite those 
memories being some of the most 
important details to the /f_ilm. 
/T_here seemed to be more focus on 
the neighborhood’s problems that 
Otto handles, rather than con -
structing his past, which could 
have been done better had Otto’s 
past memories been irrelevant to 
the story. 
Despite the music and sto -
rytelling issues, the ending le/f_t  
me both emotional and relieved 
to see a deliverance of a heart-
wrenching conclusion to Otto’s 
story. /T_he issues that Otto re -
solved had once seemed insigni/f_i -
cant, like teaching his neighbor 
how to drive or lending people his ladder. However, from all his 
work in righting the wrongs of 
his neighborhood to create a bet -
ter place for all, Otto /f_inds hope 
in realizing that life is worth liv -
ing for — even if Sonya is not by 
his side. His life brightens as he 
creates unlikely friendships with 
both old and new neighbors and 
rights the wrongs imposed by the 
villainous real estate agents.  
By the end of it, we realize that 
we are all like Otto. We hold re -
grets and anger for things we wish 
we could change from our pasts. 
We think of the future as a solid, 
concrete promise, when the fu -
ture is more of a sea of unknown 
possibilities. Like Otto, we hold 
imperfections that we criticize so deeply until someone steps into 
our lives because they /f_ind them 
beautiful. 
Otto’s story gives each and 
every one of us a reminder of 
how to heal, hold on to our loved 
ones, and /f_ind perfection in our 
mistakes. By the end, the bring -
ing together of the community 
from Otto’s work turns him into 
the most loveable character of 
the /f_ilm. Personally, I saw myself 
connecting deeply with following 
Otto’s story as he found home not 
as a physical building, but in his 
friends. “A Man Called Otto” is 
a thoughtful and heartwarming 
story that will make you laugh, 
cry, and rethink about what it 
means to live. BY Erika Myong

Being a fan of the ‘emo trinity’ 
— the three emo/pop-punk bands 
that provided the angsty, sarcas -
tic soundtrack to many a Millen -
nial and Gen Z adolescence — has 
been a rollercoaster ride in recent 
years. My Chemical Romance 
(the ‘holy spirit’ of the trin -
ity since their breakup in 2013) 
caused much rejoicing when it 
released a new single last year, 
but a full-/f_ledged band reunion 
seems unlikely. /T_his past week, 
Panic! at the Disco frontman and 
the only remaining band member 
Brendon Urie announced that the group (again, just him) would be 
splitting up. /T_hat group being the 
‘son’ of the trinity, only one mem -
ber of the OG pop punk canon 
remains, and it’s not /T_he All-
American Rejects. Fall Out Boy, 
the ‘father’ of the trinity because 
of its role in signing and promot -
ing Panic! in its infancy, is now 
the last band standing.
/T_he mere mention of the group 
summons inevitable comments 
of, “Wait, they’re still around?” 
from those who haven’t kept up 
with them post-hiatus. /T_his re -
sponse is understandable. Even a 
hardcore fan couldn’t be blamed 
for assuming that the group had 
quietly bowed out of the scene af -

chaotic electropop-infused al -
bum “Mania.” Doubts about Fall 
Out Boy’s return were put to rest, 
however, when the group teased 
new music in a bizarre clayma -
tion video last December. Final -
ly, on Jan. 18, the band dropped 
a single titled “Love From /T_he 
Other Side.” Coinciding with its 
release was the announcement 
of their eighth studio album, “So 
Much (for) Stardust,” due March 
24.
/T_he song’s surprisingly or -
chestral intro acts as a kind of 
fakeout, leading you to wonder 
if it will be a rock ballad like the 
title track from “Save Rock and 
Roll.” /T_hen Andy Hurley’s rapid -
/f_ire drumming kicks in, spark -
ing immediate recollections of 
pre-hiatus Fall Out Boy — the 
grungy, powerful sound that 
characterized most of the tracks 
on “From Under the Cork Tree,” 
including breakout hit “Sugar, 
We’re Goin Down.” /T_he drums 
reduce to a hiss at the start of the 
/f_irst verse, but regain momentum 
as the chorus nears. Similarly, the 
lush instrumental intro returns as 
an interlude between the chorus 
and second verse — the halfway 
point of the song. On the whole, 
the track’s production is just 
right, keeping the song’s energy 
up but not relying on the extreme 
rises and falls that made “Mania” 
so jarring. A minute into the almost-/f_ive-
minute song, lead vocalist Patrick 
Stump /f_inally begins to sing. His 
vocals are solid, oﬀering the usual 
soulfulness and sincerity. /T_here’s 
nothing quite as raw as you’d 
/f_ind on, say, “Take /T_his To Your 
Grave,” the band’s extra-emo 
debut album. Rather, Stump’s 
crooning sounds like a continua -
tion of the grand, pop-rock sound 
the band introduced in their last 
pre-hiatus album, Folie à Deux; 
imagine if the melodic opener to 
that album, “Disloyal Order Of 
Water Buﬀaloes,” was remixed 
with rugged closing track “West 
Coast Smoker,” and you get the 
idea. 
As for the song’s lyrical con -
tent, “Love From /T_he Other Side” 
takes on a decidedly retrospective 
tone. It’s set on the other side of a 
painful relationship and, accord -
ing to the chorus, the other side 
of “the apocalypse” — perhaps a 
high-concept metaphor for the 
painful breakup that convinced 
the speaker that “every lover’s 
got a little dagger in their hand.” 
Peppered throughout the song is 
the unanswered question: “What 
would you trade the pain for?,” 
suggesting the singer has come 
to a level of acceptance of what 
they’ve been through because it’s 
made them who they are.
Amidst the lines that will end 
up as Instagram bios and tattoos (“We were a hammer to the Statue 
of David;” “You were the sun -
shine/of my lifetime”), there’s also 
a recurring theme of American-
Dream ennui that re/f_lects how 
the band has aged alongside its 
original fanbase. Teenage heart -
break has been traded for “Model 
house life meltdowns;” Stump 
reminds us that “there’s no way 
oﬀ the hamster wheel on this rat 
race.” Both complaints are sure 
to resonate with Millennial au -
diences whose yellowed Warped 
Tour tickets are now nestled in 
scrapbooks alongside pictures of 
their kids. 
If “Love From /T_he Other Side” 
is a sign of what to expect from 
Fall Out Boy’s eighth album, it 
seems safe to get our hopes up 
again. /T_he original emo trinity 
might have fragmented, but pop 
punk’s in/f_luence hasn’t died out. 
Acts like jxdn, Machine Gun Kel -
ly, and Olivia Rodrigo are reviv -
ing the genre for a new generation 
of fans, which in turn has sparked 
renewed interest in old Fall Out 
Boy albums. Now’s the perfect 
time to catch up on their catalog. 
You won’t have to wait half a de -
cade for another installment, just 
a couple of months — and thanks 
to the quarter system’s disorient -
ing pace, the time is sure to /f_ly by.BY Bailey Bujnosek

Women’s Basketball Wins Big, Honoring National Women and Girls in 
Sports Day
Tritons’ Magic Runs Out in Loss to Crimson Tide/T_he UC San Diego women’s 
basketball team (10–10, 7–3 Big 
West) ran away with a victory 
against UC Riverside (4–16, 2–8 
Big West) this Saturday, emerging 
63–50 victors. Fresh oﬀ of a win 
against California State Univer -
sity, Northridge, the UCSD Tri -
tons made their mark with strong 
performances both individually 
and as a team, dominating the UC 
Riverside Highlanders for the ma -
jority of the game. /T_he event gath -

ence, with Pep Band, in particular, 
standing out as the MVPs; their 
cheerleading eﬀorts may or may 
not have contributed to Riverside’s 
paltry 57.1% free throw rate.
Despite a slow start — with 
UCSD down 6 points within the 
/f_irst 3 minutes of the /f_irst quar -
ter — the Tritons pushed hard to 
make up the loss and surge into 
the lead. A consequent pair of 
3-pointers from redshirt senior 
guard Emily Cangelosi helped 
make up the de/f_icit, and 2 points 
from a jump shot by graduate stu -
dent guard Sydney Brown with 6 
seconds le/f_t on the clock pushed 
the score in the home team’s fa -
vor for the /f_irst time in the game, 
a dynamic that would continue 
through the rest of the a/f_ternoon. 
/T_he /f_irst quarter ended 14–12 with 
UCSD in the lead.
/T_he second quarter picked up 
right where the /f_irst le/f_t oﬀ, with a BY Emer Nolan

the Triton roster. /T_he hosts held 
control of play with such consis -
tency that the Highlanders were 
unable to gain a purchase for the 
/f_irst half of the quarter. Brown 
extended her point tally with a 
pair of jumpers, and junior guard 
Parker Montgomery made an im -
pact on the score sheet with a good 
set of free throws, a jumper, and a 
3-pointer. Perhaps the most pic -
ture-perfect moment of the period 
was a shot taken and sunk from 
just beyond midcourt by redshirt 
senior guard Julia Macabuhay just 
a/f_ter the hal/f_time buzzer. Unfortu -
nately for the hosts, it didn’t count 
toward the score. Nonetheless, the 
teams stood 35–24 at the break, 
with the scales tipped in UCSD’s 
favor.
/T_he third quarter saw more of 
the same, with a free throw each 
from Cangelosi and Montgomery. 
Despite the Tritons dominating in 
points, the third period was one of 
more back-and-forth scoring. Al -
though UC Riverside put 13 more 
points on the board, they were un -
able to catch up to a very in-form 
UCSD. A set of strong free throws 
by Cangelosi pushed the home 
side to a 16-point lead with 20 
seconds le/f_t on the clock, pushing 
the score for the quarter to 53–37.
More of the same ensued in the 
/f_inal period, despite a few points 
gained by UC Riverside from a 
jump shot and a free throw in the 
beginning. Cangelosi continued 
to /f_ind the basket, and the quar -
ter also saw contributions from Montgomery and sophomore 
guard Izzy Forsyth, who was also 
having a productive a/f_ternoon. 
UC Riverside narrowed the gap 
in the score from 16 to 13 points, 
but the Tritons were clear lead -
ers throughout, and the /f_inal few 
minutes were just a waiting game 
for the buzzer to cement the hosts 
as victors. When the buzzer /f_inally 
rang, UCSD was the comfort -
able winner, with the score set at 
63–50.
Cangelosi was a standout play -
er for the Tritons that day, rack -
ing up 22 points, which included 
4 3-pointers.  Montgomery and Brown made big waves, scoring in 
the double digits with 14 and 10 
points, respectively, and Forsyth, 
who led the team in rebounds 
with 9 points. Coming back a/f_ter 
an initial de/f_icit was impressive, 
and the controlling win will con -
tribute to positive momentum in 
the games to come. 
Saturday was also National 
Girls and Women in Sports Day, 
which was commemorated by the 
team a/f_ter the game. Coach Heidi 
Vanderveer took a few moments 
to address the audience, among 
which was a group of young girls 
who had taken to the court at half -time to show oﬀ their own basket -
ball skills. Speaking to these kids, 
Vanderveer sent heartfelt mes -
sages of encouragement and em -
powerment to the next generation 
of sportswomen.
/T_he Tritons are set to travel 
on /T_hursday to take on UC Irvine 
in another Big West matchup for 
their /f_irst meetup of the 2022-23 
season. UC Irvine will certainly 
pose a challenge, as current Big 
West leaders, but UCSD will look 
to come away with another vic -
tory and extend their new win -
ning streak to three games on the 
bounce.

UC San Diego women’s ten -
nis (2–2) fell to the University of 
Alabama (3–1) on Saturday, losing 
6–1 in their fourth nonconference 
matchup of the season. /T_he UCSD 
Tritons came into the contest hav -
ing come back from 3–1 de/f_icits in 
their last two outings but were un -
able to extend their streak to three 
against the impressive Crimson 
Tide. On a positive note for the 
Tritons, sophomore Katelyn Vu 
continued her run of triumphant 
performances, winning her third 
straight singles match from the #6 
spot. Vu and senior Rachel Wag -
ner also won their third straight 
doubles match of the season in a 
hard-fought set.
UCSD started oﬀ on a bad foot, 
losing the doubles point early. 
On the #2 court, freshman Grace 
Gamal and junior Ella Pachl had 
their serve broken early and were 
unable to recover, losing 6–0. A 
similar story was written on the 
#1 court as sophomores Kelly 
Leung and Naomi Nguyen rallied 
from 3–1 down to cut the de/f_icit to 
4–3. However, they were unable to 
control the momentum and even -
tually lost their set 6–3. 
Vu and Wagner earned a con -
solation victory for the Tritons 
on the #3 court, winning their 
set 6–4. /T_he pair took advantage 
of Alabama’s mistakes with some 
excellent net play. A/f_ter an ace 
down the middle for the Triton 
duo pushed the set to 5–4, Vu and 
Wagner broke their opponents’ 
serve for a solid doubles win. /T_he 
Tritons rallied to deuce, and a /f_i -
nessed lob at the net forced an 
Alabama mistake on the deciding 
point. /T_his would be a rare bright 
spot for the Tritons in this match -
up, as the Crimson Tide took con -trol in singles play.
Two quick Alabama wins in 
singles put the Tritons in an early 
3–0 hole. Senior Sophie Pearson 
was unable to gain control of her 
match and lost 6–0, 6–1 on the 
#5 court. Pachl also lost her /f_irst 
set 6–0 from the #2 slot, and de -
spite valiantly /f_ighting back in the 
second, she fell just short at 6–4. 
/T_his meant that the Tritons would 
have to win all four of the remain -
ing singles matches to claim their 
third straight victory of the sea -
son.
UCSD’s hope for a miracle was 
sparked yet again by Vu, who took 
a break advantage in the /f_irst set en route to a 6–4 lead. Vu, last week’s 
UCSD Athlete of the Week, gained 
momentum again early in the sec -
ond set, earning her the 6–4, 6–4 
win and UCSD’s /f_irst point of the 
match. Despite Vu’s win being the 
only bright spot of the day, the Tri -
tons will hope to capitalize on her 
good form throughout the season.
Unfortunately for UCSD, the 
remaining Tritons fell short in 
their singles matches. /T_he decid -
ing match took place on Court 
#1, where Leung came thrillingly 
close to a second Triton win. A/f_ter 
being broken in her second ser -
vice game in the /f_irst set, Leung 
almost returned the favor, earning a deuce point at 3–1. Y et a pow -
erful cross-court forehand won 
Alabama the deciding point and 
eventually the set, 6–1. Leung bat -
tled hard in the second set, with 
each player holding serve at 4–3. 
Leung’s serve and forehand were 
particularly potent, contribut -
ing to her slim lead to that point. 
In the eighth game, Leung broke 
serve to give herself a 5–3 advan -
tage, seemingly destined to take 
the match to a tiebreaker third 
set. However, her Crimson Tide 
opponent rallied back to win four 
games unanswered, taking the set 
7–5 and clinching the match for 
Alabama./T_he /f_inal two singles contests 
oﬀered no consolation to the Tri -
tons. On Court #4, Nguyen was 
beaten 6–2, 6–2 in a tough match, 
and Gamal competed in her 
matchup on Court #3, ultimately 
the tightest of the day. Her 7–5, 
6–4 loss was a back-and-forth af -
fair, with the Triton freshman fall -
ing just short toward the end of 
both sets. 
UCSD will look to return to 
winning ways when they take the 
trolley south to face San Diego 
State University on Feb. 4. /T_he 
Tritons will be looking to make 
history against the SDSU Aztecs, 
having lost 10 straight matchups 
against their cross-city rivals. UC -
SD’s /f_inal nonconference tune-ups 
come the following week, as they 
face Pomona-Pitzer on the road 
and return home for a matchup 
against Sacramento State Univer -
sity.
