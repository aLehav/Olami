/T_he Associated Students Sena -
tors met to discuss election re -
forms, Instagram overhaul, and 
senate project updates during 
their Week Two meeting.
Several measures of election 
reforms were discussed during 
the public input section, includ -
ing taking down pictures from 
the ballot, expanding allotted 
time for the campaign, and pro -
viding more information about 
A.S. elections and administra -
tion. Data showed that, during 
the 2022 election, only 10% of UC 
San Diego students voted, while 
only 8% did in the 2021 election. 
Senators also pointed out that it is 
counterintuitive to limit students 
participating in both Associated 
Students and college councils.
In the following special pre -
sentation sponsored by CCO Ro -
sario, the public relations team 
discussed concerns about the 
Associated Students’ Instagram 
account (@asucsd). According to 
presenters Yao, Wei, and Makam, 
there haven’t been many interac -
tions with account followers, de -
spite continuous growth within 
other A.S.-related platforms in -
cluding ASCE. 
/T_he public relation team at -
tributed the problem largely to 
factors such as inconsistent and 
inactive posting, unappealing 
graphics, and lack of original 
posts. To improve social media 
engagement, the team decided to 
maintain the account regularly, 
stick to brand guidelines, and stay 
authentic and transparent. /T_hey 
also made a weekly content rou -
tine: on Monday, they will post 
short videos or posts detailing 
upcoming events/news for this 
week; they will give a campus re -
source spotlight on one particular 
UCSD resource center on Tues -
day; and weekly check-in/inter -
active posts and fun reels will be 
out on Wednesday and /T_hursday 
respectively.
Later Senator Leung gave 
updates on the project co-orga -
nized with Senator Urbieta. /T_hey 
planned to increase /f_irst-aid kits 
on campus and potentially add 
classes sponsored by American 
Heart Associations. /T_hey are cur -
rently working out the details and 
funding. /T_hey also scheduled a 
meeting with the student trans -
portation advisory committee 
with the hope of raising student 
awareness of safe transportation, 
such as scooters, skateboarding, 
and bicycling.PRISM CENTER
UCSD to lead $50.5 million endeavor to im -
prove computing efficiency
By ZARA IRSHAD /gid00020/gid00006/gid00015/gid00010/gid00016/gid00019/gid00001/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
A group of engineers at UC San Diego have 
created an electronic patch that can monitor 
biomolecules within deep tissue. Referred to 
as a “photoacoustic patch,” the silicon polymer de -
vice can uniquely detect biomolecules in deep tis -
sues, rather than just the surface of the skin. Deep 
tissue detection can help spearhead early disease 
treatment, potentially preventing long-term physical 
rami/f_ications said illnesses cause otherwise. 
Nanoengineering Professor Sheng Xu served as 
corresponding author and representative, completed 
the research work and paper. Other co-authors in 
the study include postdoctoral researchers and engi -
neering doctoral students from UCSD, all of whom 
believe that the advancement opens up doors for 
physician use once more clinical trials on the device 
are executed, as the current sensors monitor biomol -
ecules less precisely.
Sheng aﬃrmed that the device could be game-
changing for spotting life-threatening diseases.
“Our device shows great potential in close moni -
toring of high-risk groups, enabling timely interven -
tions at urgent moments,” she explained.
/T_hrough this invention, medical professionals 
now have access to pivotal information on a patient’s 
condition and can detect life-threatening conditions 
such as malignant tumors, cerebral and gut hemor -
rhages, and more. Additionally, the completed re -
search paper emphasized how the ability to monitor 
biomolecules can help “track wellness levels, diag -
nose diseases, and evaluate therapeutic outcomes” 
for those in need. 
Diﬀerent from other devices meant to monitor 
biomolecules, such as magnetic resonance imaging 
and x-ray devices, the device can continuously and 
discretely monitor and outlook internal molecule 
levels, providing accessible and accurate viewing ca -
pabilities. Portable and pocket-sized, the patch can 
be worn for extended periods of time which is ideal 
for continuous, quick monitoring and timely inter -
ventions. 
“Wearable devices based on electrochemistry for 
biomolecules detection, not limited to hemoglobin, 
are good candidates for long-term wearable monitor -
ing applications,” Chen explained.
Additionally, the wearable patch includes low-
power laser pulses that prove safer and less invasive than typical bulky x-ray scanning techniques. Using 
the patch, researchers hope to monitor patients who 
are at higher risk of chronic medical abnormalities, 
such as abnormal blood collection in key organs, as 
well as other general services like tracking high blood 
pressure, which is notorious for causing health ad -
versities such as heart attacks and vascular illnesses. 
/T_he patch can comfortably attach to the skin for 
monitoring, and it contains laser diodes which radi -
ate into the user’s tissue. /T_he biomolecules located 
deep into the skin are then re/f_lected from these la -
sers and radiate acoustic waves. /T_hese waves are then 
stored by the device’s transducers, which spatially 
draw out the emitted parts of the biomolecule, map -
ping out the internal chemistry to then be used by 
physicians and researchers. 
Allowing for a range in wavelengths emitted, the 
patch can draw out a large range of biomolecule sizes 
beneath the skin, opening doors for potential ad -
vanced clinical applications. For example, the device 
is able to map out clear, three-dimensional images of 
hemoglobin molecules up to centimeters below the 
skin, and has resolution capabilities through incor -
porating diﬀerent wavelengths based on molecule 
size to identify a range of internal substances. Fur -
thermore, the researchers tested the patch’s capa -
bilities with monitoring blood /f_low through vessels, 
/f_inding that the device can detect key vascular fea -
tures, such as the amount of blood /f_low and blood 
vessel size, which can help discern related conditions.
Now, the device’s capabilities are being explored 
further for features such as body temperature regula -
tion; however, the UCSD engineering team acknowl -
edges that the electronic patch requires more work to 
reach desired detection features. Such improvements 
include decreasing the size of the detector’s electronic 
hardware located on the back of the patch. /T_hrough 
doing so, the device will be able to map out internal 
structures to a greater depth, which is crucial for ac -
curate organ and deep tissue imaging.
/T_he UCSD research team hopes to begin working 
on these patch improvements in tandem with physi -
cians to work on further solutions. If such advance -
ments are achieved, the electronic patch will provide 
an accessible, non-invasive outlet to measure life-
saving vitals.

Binaries: what are they good for?
By ERIK WIEBOLDT
/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
/T_here is a basic human in -
stinct to separate oneself from 
others. Y ou are yourself. Others 
are others. As you grow in a com -
munity with people with similar 
backgrounds, there is a tendency 
to “other” those people who are 
outside of your group. /T_his “oth -
ering” is the basis for all forms of 
discrimination, where individu -
als come to represent entire com -
munities and associations come 
to represent the whole. Where 
this falls apart is at the individual 
level. It’s hard to believe in base -
less generalizations when you 
meet someone who can readily 
disprove them. For example, I ad -
mit that I used to have some in -
ternalized peladophobia, or fear of 
bald people. /T_his probably stems 
from the fact that I can count the 
hairs on my father’s head. I used 
to fear them, and fear becoming 
like them, until I met bald people 
and found out that there are many 
reasons people go bald and that 
should be celebrated. My fear has 
now shi/f_ted to balding people. For 
me, the idea that you’re losing the 
battle and don’t want people to 
comment is really truly terrifying. 
Don’t worry, I’m working on it, 
and I’m sure not all balding people 
are scary. Or at least theoretically 
I do. 
I bring up this separation from 
oneself and others because last 
year I came to the realization that 
I am non-binary. No, that does 
not mean I’m against computer 
coding. Although, I am pretty bad 
with tech. What this means for me 
is that I do not associate myself 
with the characteristics assigned 
to maleness or femaleness. I pre -
fer to use non-gendered pronouns 
and language and prefer to dress, 
act, and essentially perform my 
identity, through my gender as I 
see /f_it. 
Binaries are useful in reducing 
complexity and presenting a lim -
ited number of options. It’s either 
this or that — no nuance. While 
this may be helpful to those who 
are indecisive, as a whole the lack 
of variability with binaries leads to miscategorizations and exceptions 
to the rule. For example, if some -
one was to ask you whether you 
felt happy or sad at this moment, 
how would you respond? Y ou 
might answer one way or anoth -
er out of courtesy, but really this 
question implies a constant, rigid 
separation. To juxtapose these 
two is to assume that someone is 
always either happy or sad, that 
someone is always feeling ener -
gized or tired, healthy or sick, and 
further masculine or feminine.
Labels are sometimes help -
ful in that they ascribe a set of 
characteristics with particular as -
sociations and help people group 
together individuals who share 
an identity. But the reality is that 
many of these labels are not so 
simple. Where are you from? Well 
you presumably live in San Diego, 
but you may be from out of state, 
or international; you may also 
have family that is not from here 
or have lived somewhere else in 
your life. But it’s easier to choose 
an answer in a certain context 
than to chart your family tree at 
the function. 
Labels tend to stick. When you 
try to change how you identify 
yourself, people may remember a 
version of you that no longer ex -
ists. Y ou’re not a baby anymore, 
not a kid, yet every time I visit my 
Irish family I’m a 5-year-old all 
over again. Sometimes this isn’t so 
bad. It’s hard to keep up with peo -
ple and it’s good to update them 
when you can, but it’s also true 
that people are resistant to change. 
/T_heir memory of you can become 
their understanding of you and it 
can be hard to break that habit. 
/T_here’s a disconnect between the 
self and the perceived self and in 
some ways, this disconnect can 
“other” you from yourself. /T_his 
is a universal experience. People 
change, but it’s easier to think that 
the world is static around you than 
to consider that everyone changes. 
/T_he reality is, to put it bluntly, that 
to be static is to not be alive. 
/T_he phrase “social construct” 
is o/f_ten thrown around to describe 
everything from gender to capital -
ism. But these descriptions are 
poignant. Really, at the end of the 
day, many of the things we take for granted are fabricated, diluted, 
and given more importance than 
is really necessary. Going back 
to “othering, ” it’s easier to create 
boxes to put people into than it 
is to ask, why make boxes at all? 
Or why so few? Society constructs 
convenient narratives that o/f_ten 
go unquestioned. But they’re not 
convenient for all. Have you ever 
been told that you’re something 
that you know you’re not? When 
someone identi/f_ies you as some -
thing you’re not, you exist as an 
outlier in their understanding of 
the world. If someone incorrectly 
assumes something fundamental 
to your character, it can o/f_ten be 
a jarring experience. It can play 
with your self-concept. But people can’t be expected to know you ful -
ly or get everything perfect all the 
time right? And while that might 
be true, it doesn’t mean it can’t af -
fect you. 
So we’ve talked about labels, 
binaries, and constructions, but 
all of these are essentially the same 
issue. /T_hey all have to do with 
language and its limitations. /T_he 
idea that you have to /f_ind a label 
that /f_its you for other people to 
identify you by, or identify with 
you, implies that there is a label 
to be found. And sometimes there 
is. I didn’t know that there was a 
community of bald-phobics until 
I found the word peladophobia. 
Other times language, or even just 
English, doesn’t seem /f_it to con -ceptualize an aspect of identity. 
Connotations come with labels, 
and so do binaries. Y ou either 
have a given label or you do not. 
So again we’re stuck in social con -
structions mainly because conve -
nience is the enemy of nuance. 
When it comes to identi/f_ica -
tions, it’s usually best to ask be -
fore you assume. Y es, it does make 
things complicated when you have 
to double-check, but at least you 
will know for sure. /T_his matters 
especially for the people you are 
close to. For me, it’s the eﬀort that 
counts. Eﬀort shows that you care 
about someone’s identity and that 
can mean a lot. It’s the least you 
can do to help make the “other” 
familiar.

HECTOR ARRIETA
Although I collect jazz records 
and listen to jazz from a variety of 
nations including Japan and Bra -
zil, I had never been to a jazz show 
before. However, that all changed 
when Grammy-award-winning 
jazz composer Terence Blanchard 
blessed  UC San Diego with his 
presence during a two-day event. 
On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, 
Blanchard gave a talk about his 
life and career along with UCSD’s 
Professor Emeritus of Music Cecil 
Lytle at /T_he Guggenheim /T_heater 
in UCSD’s Park and Market. /T_his 
talk was a part of the Helen Edi -
son Lecture Series and was fol -
lowed by a show with the E-Col -
lective and Turtle Island Quartet 
on Jan. 17 in the Price Center East 
Ballroom. 
Before Jan. 17, to me, jazz was 
simply the etched soundwaves on 
a record or a compressed MP3 
/f_ile on a streaming website. Jazz 
was something that I could con -sume over and over again and 
have countless hours to ponder 
on, or, more realistically, simply 
consume for the sake of listening 
to music that I /f_ind enjoyable. No 
number of concerts could have 
prepared me for a jazz show like 
this because jazz simply isn’t like 
other genres of music. Jazz o/f_ten 
doesn’t have lyrics for you to fol -
low along. Yet, it isn’t like other 
lyric-less genres like EDM either 
— a mash-up of sounds whose 
only purpose is to give dopamine. 
While jazz does release dopa -
mine, it does more than that. To 
paraphrase a point that Blanchard 
made during the show, jazz dares 
you. It dares you to think, not to 
simply consume, and to do so 
on the /f_ly with only one listen is 
quite diﬃcult. When you have the 
record or stream in front of you, 
you have the power to constantly 
change the imagery and themes 
you /f_ind in the record; it perhaps 
even changes through multiple 
listens. 
While the nature of doing 
this during a live performance Concert Review:

may be diﬃcult, the beauty of 
Blanchard’s performance was 
that it gave me the instruments 
— pun intended — to easily con -
struct a world and story in my 
own head, which, to me, is part 
of the beauty of the genre. From 
track to track, I couldn’t shake the 
image of someone — who I later 
established to be from the coun -
tryside — entering the big city for 
the /f_irst time. /T_he /f_irst track es -
tablishes an almost seductive ap -
peal of the city that leads into the 
next song where the tempo picks 
up, indicating that my character 
is entering the nightlife of the city 
in a drunken haze; they are lost 
and afraid but still in awe, only 
to be reminded of the concrete 
jungle they inhabit as the song 
speeds up, then feeling like all 
control is lost, only for the high to 
come to the close. 
/T_he third track felt like a rein -
forcement of the concrete jungle 
setting as Blanchard’s trumpet 
had a militaristic tempo that jux -
taposed with the piano’s sooth -
ingness, reminding my character that, although the city is beauti -
ful, you must always stay vigilant. 
/T_his then contrasts with the fol -
lowing track which felt more re -
/f_lective with its serene guitar and 
mellow trumpet. It feels like the 
day a/f_ter the madness, wondering 
if this life is truly what they want. 
/T_his is then followed by another 
night in town, represented by the 
next track: another seductive, 
jazzy song.
Suddenly, there’s a change 
in pace — during the show, the 
Turtle Island Quartet were given 
center stage to perform their own 
song — as my main character be -
gins to have /f_lashbacks of his life 
back in the countryside. /T_he track 
feels folky and progressively gets 
faster and more jubilant, paral -
leling how one’s heart might race 
at the joy of the thought of home. 
/T_his con/f_lict between city and 
countryside all culminates with 
the last track as the piano and vi -
olin begin to have a conversation, 
the appeal of both the city and 
countryside pulling from each 
side, ebbing and /f_lowing with one another. Although the piano took 
center stage for a good portion 
of the song, eventually all the in -
struments would introduce them -
selves. /T_his was when I closed my 
eyes and put myself in the shoes of 
my character; I could see the vari -
ety of clashing shapes and colors 
hitting my head, causing me to be 
engulfed by the euphoric collec -
tions of sounds coming in from 
all angles. I nearly fell out of my 
chair, but just like that, the show 
was over with a climactic /f_inish.
Although I didn’t receive a 
conclusion to the story that I de -
rived from Blanchard’s perfor -
mance, the mastery of his cra/f_t  
le/f_t me so speechless and satis/f_ied 
that I felt like not having the end -
ing made it a lot better. Having an 
ending means I have the whole 
story and could be subject to for -
getfulness, but not having an end -
ing means the story — this show 
— goes on forever in my mind.

“Severance” Reflection: Routine Will Be the Death of Us
“Severance” is a science /f_iction novel written by Ling Ma that begins with the undo -
ing of civilization when a viral infection ravages much of the world. Known as “Shen 
Fever,” the /f_ictional illness and its impact bear heavy similarities to COVID-19 despite 
being published in late 2018, over a year prior to the start of the pandemic. Both viruses 
originated in China, spread rapidly in heavily populated spaces and in areas that handled 
large industry shipments, initiated country-wide lockdowns, caused a fall in industry, 
and forced people to re-evaluate their lives and the way they spend their time. Ma’s sa -
tirical critique of capitalism hailed her as an oracle of the pandemic. /T_his makes her /f_irst 
novel both an incredibly eerie read and a more prevalent one. 
Society underwent massive self-re/f_lection, emotional turmoil, and existential crises 
as a result of COVID-19. Personally, it feels as though many of these important and hard 
conversations /f_lattened out again as the world around us picked back up. I remember 
sitting with my friends in our backyards, more than six feet apart, and talking about 
nothing besides our feelings because when the world slowed, that was all we had. We 
grew a lot from those conversations. But now we’re far apart, leading new lives, and when 
we reconvene, there’s so much to /f_ill each other in on that, sometimes, we lose track of 
the important questions we used to hold for each other. “Severance” not only helps ignite 
many of these buried feelings but also doubles down on them because, unlike COVID-19, 
Shen Fever is always fatal for all who contract it. /T_here was never any time for life to re -
turn to its constant /f_low. 
 /T_he novel centers around Candace Chen and begins with her breakup with her part -
ner Jonathan. Jonathan was a large part of her life in the years that followed her parents’ 
passing, but he eventually wanted to leave New York. Candace does not want to leave 
with him because she cannot abandon her position at a publishing company, and with her 
support system thinning, she dives further into the job she stumbled into. She is not pas -
sionate about what she does, but she is loyal to her company and what it asks of her. Her 
life becomes an unrelenting routine, where day in and day out, everything is the same. 
Even as Shen Fever dissolves the world around her, she /f_inds herself in the oﬃce carrying 
out her contract. 
Before anything else, it is important to understand what Shen Fever does to a person. 
Once infected, a person becomes a shell, forced to repeat their most recent or consistent 
routine mindlessly. A person aﬄicted with the illness might take out clothes from their 
closet, lay them on their bed, and hang them back up again — all the while neglecting 
to eat, drink, sleep, or partake in any action that might sustain them. Shen Fever causes 
death by absent-minded routine and rigid monotony. Viciously committed to her work, 
the line between fevered activities and Candace’s personhood becomes blurry. Candance 
is distinguished by her thought processes and freedom of choice, but if she chooses to 
stay in one space until the end of time, does that make her any diﬀerent than the fevered? 
Perhaps eating and drinking are merely acts to prolong such a routine that, at the end of 
the day, is meant to serve capitalistic ideals. 
Two timelines run simultaneously throughout “Severance,” alternating frequently. 
/T_he /f_irst one starts with Candance’s childhood and the key instances that shaped her 
life and runs until the end of the world begins. /T_he second one begins a/f_ter she leaves a Jonathan Shlesinger  /gid00020/gid00006/gid00015/gid00010/gid00016/gid00019/gid00001/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
run-down New York and joins a group of people who banded together to survive. Travel 
subdues her, but time is also to blame. She once had immense freedom in her young 
adulthood, although she can’t remember if she was truly happy even then. It’s hard to 
/f_ind happiness without purpose, especially when purpose itself is an incredibly arbitrary 
concept. In every part of Candace’s life, she feels aimless in some capacity, but the world 
seems to be structured for endless emptiness. It gears her toward servitude and makes 
her hollow once entrenched in it. /T_he world pressures her into a routine and waits for the 
monotony to kill her. All Shen Fever ever does for others is speed up the process. 
Ma encapsulates Candace’s aimlessness succinctly early on as she describes how Can -
dance would wander New York for hours on end in the days when she was fresh out of 
college and unemployed. From early in the morning until the sun began to set she was 
walking around the city, /f_inding its communities, secrets, grit, and glamor. She would 
stop for lunch, usually something cheap in Chinatown, and then begin. She would bring 
her camera and photograph the city and its vulnerable places. Eventually, she started a 
blog. Intimate pictures of New York were published anonymously. From the reader’s per -
spective, despite Candace’s wandering, the blog seems to ground her. She /f_inds a purpose 
by encapsulating the world around her. She makes a purpose out of nothing. 
Around halfway through the novel, the audience discovers that Candance is preg -
nant. In spite of everything that seems to dissuade her from keeping the baby, she chooses 
to do so anyway. It is this decision that solidi/f_ies a shi/f_t in her character. Her active de -
cision-making — the choice to no longer fall down the path of least resistance — makes 
her more solid. She is giving herself purpose again. Not from the standpoint that her 
womanhood is de/f_ined by her ability to have children, but by making a decision that takes 
her out of the monotony and thinking about something or someone other than her em -
ployers and contract. /T_he opportunity to leave the city with Jonathan may have granted 
her a similar purpose or freedom. It’s about choosing to do something that transcends 
obligation and creates something we want to /f_ight for. /T_his is how Ma advocates that we 
keep our heads above the waters of monotony that otherwise might be the death of us. 
/T_he most eﬀective use of our freedom is /f_inding or creating something worth living for 
and choosing it over and over again. 
I count myself lucky for /f_inding this novel in the time that I did, at the cusp of a new 
year and as COVID’s daily impact on life seems to wane. I’ve never been one for resolu -
tions, but this novel inspired me to make some, and my favorite among them has been 
journaling. I’ve been ending my days by chronicling them so that I might look back and 
recall the little things that I choose to love. I think freedom is self-de/f_ined. You do not 
have to move away from your routine or abandon the structure, you just have to make 
your life serve you in a way that brings you joy. For example, I can’t say I am a fan of all my 
classes, but I like that some of them force me to wake up early so that I can take in more 
of the day and enjoy the sun I /f_ind myself needing more and more. I like that they force 
me to walk across our campus, which I /f_ind genuinely beautiful. I like talking to new 
people in classes and sitting with old friends. I /f_ind freedom in /f_inding things to enjoy in 
my routine. And if freedom is a choice, I’ll keep choosing to appreciate the life that I live.

Movie Review: “Avatar: The Way of  Water”
I was a kid when “Avatar” was released in 2009, but it remained a big part of my life. 
A couple of years ago, my family babysat my cousins and we could not decide on a movie. 
My parents had /f_inally escaped the period where their kids wanted to exclusively watch 
children’s movies and they were not about to go back, so my mom said, “Put on ‘Avatar.’” 
My cousins were about 12 and eight years old, and they had never seen a PG-13 movie 
before. I worried it might be too violent for them, but as soon as we pressed play, they were 
completely engrossed by the new world of plants, animals, and people unfurling in front 
of them. “Avatar” had been in my life for longer than I could remember, but rewatching 
it next to two awestruck children reminded me how powerful the /f_ilm is when viewed for 
the /f_irst time.
Unlike anything put to screen before, “Avatar” utilizes immersive visual eﬀects to tell 
the story of Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), an ex-marine sent to the moon Pandora for 
its natural resources. /T_hrough the use of a remotely-controlled avatar, Sully encounters 
the Na’vi, a native race with a spiritual connection to nature. As he is monitored by Colo -
nel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and taught the ways of the Na’vi by Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), 
Sully /f_inds himself torn between loyalty to his own people and the new worldview he has 
discovered. /T_he /f_ilm became a massive hit that people went to see week a/f_ter week, and 
“Avatar” grew to become the highest-grossing /f_ilm of all time.
Despite this overwhelming success, the development of “Avatar: /T_he Way of Water” 
would remain a mystery for the next 13 years. What was it going to be about? Was it 
going to be made at all? Director James Cameron announced in 2010 that he wanted 
to make several sequels, but a/f_ter the record-shattering release of “Avatar,” Cameron’s 
legendary /f_ilmography came to a halt. In the place of tangible releases came reports that 
he was working on something: a /f_ilm that would take /f_ive years to shoot, cost hundreds 
of millions of dollars, and push the bounds of trailblazing technology even further than 
its predecessor. More than a decade later, this /f_ilm became “Avatar: /T_he Way of Water.” 
In the sequel, humans have returned to Pandora to eradicate Na’vi insurgency and 
establish a new home for mankind. As a result, Jake Sully and his family must /f_lee the 
forest and hide among the Metkayina, a clan of Na’vi who are deeply connected to the 
ocean and its creatures. As the Sully family adapts to this new way of life, they are hunted 
by Quaritch, who was killed by Neytiri and has returned as an avatar in search of revenge. 
When written plainly, this plot is repetitive and uninspiring. It involves many of the 
same building blocks that supported the /f_irst “Avatar.” Why, then, has this /f_ilm become 
the highest-grossing /f_ilm of 2022? First of all, the /f_ilm has had good marketing and tim -Kaley Chun  /gid00020/gid00006/gid00015/gid00010/gid00016/gid00019/gid00001/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
ing. Many people saw “Avatar: /T_he Way of Water” around the holidays with family and 
friends. However, that cannot be the only explanation, because not every /f_ilm released in 
December crosses the threshold of two billion dollars.
Ask anyone who has seen the /f_ilm, and the obvious answer is that “Avatar: /T_he Way of 
Water” provides a viewing experience that once again reinvents what CGI, motion cap -
ture, and 3D technology are able to accomplish. In spite of its reductive plot, “Avatar: /T_he 
Way of Water” is breathtaking. It begins in the familiar forests of Pandora, then moves 
with the Sully family as they dive through crystal waters, bounce across woven /f_loors, 
and swim with fantastical ocean creatures. /T_hough many consumers consider long run -
times a burden, the bene/f_it is that “Avatar: /T_he Way of Water” never rushes toward the 
next scene. On the contrary, each character is given time to interact with their surround -
ings, which creates an unusual balance where the /f_ilm’s plot is less important than its 
visual world-building aspects.
“Avatar: /T_he Way of Water” does have /f_laws: it is long and slow and was made without 
considering many criticisms aimed at the /f_irst /f_ilm. It introduces more characters than 
can properly be characterized, leaving the plot shallow and scattered. However, this /f_ilm’s 
massive traction indicates this is still the type of /f_ilm moviegoers are willing to see. Why? 
Because people will go to theaters for visual quality despite a lackluster storyline, and 
they crave /f_ilms that can be watched and discussed communally. People want spectacle, 
imagination, and themes that can connect to life even when the characters are giant blue 
aliens. /T_hough it is not a perfect /f_ilm, “Avatar: /T_he Way of Water” uses its vibrant colors, 
textures, and sounds to accomplish something that most CGI fails to do today: it captures 
the childlike wonder of watching something really good for the /f_irst time and thinking 
that it might be one of the most beautiful /f_ilms you’ve ever seen.

BRADLEY BEGGS
In search of peace and quiet,
I found cicadas.
Their loud chirps and monotonous hum
breaking the silence I sought after.
The conversations with myself
and sounds of the city below
all accompanied by the draining
of these unrelenting bugs.
How long have they shared their voices?
Did the ancients too discover places of seren -
ity?
Only to be met
with a cacophony of natures’ loudest musi -
cians?
In this, I find comfort -
knowing that other pursuits of quiet contem -
plation have suffered the same fate.
The cicadas tell me of their place in history: 
as long as we are here to listen, they will sing.
My journey away from the noise
only brought me to a louder place, still,
I grew to cherish their old voices
and began another search for peace and quiet.Bradley Beggs   /gid00013/gid00010/gid00007/gid00006/gid00020/gid00021/gid00026/gid00013/gid00006/gid00001/gid00006/gid00005/gid00010/gid00021/gid00016/gid00019

What The Beauty Within Really Means
By SamAntha PHAN
/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
Recently, I’ve been seeing vid -
eos of young women on TikTok 
repeating the billionth version of 
the same trend. A young, attrac -
tive woman stands in front of the 
internet and asks them to tell her 
what type of pretty she is. Is she 
popular or model pretty? Stan -
dard or natural pretty? /T_he sound 
attached is even sadder: a woman 
asks a man to tell her what he likes 
about her besides her beauty, and 
he replies saying that he doesn’t 
know what else there could be. 
Lately, I have noticed a lot of 
TikTok trends that emphasize the 
importance of beauty. It isn’t just 
the one I described above. /T_here 
are countless people on TikTok 
walking us through their anti-
aging beauty routines, claiming 
that these moisturizers or serums 
will preserve their youth. “I want 
to look 25 when I am 50, ” they say 
as they put on their tenth prod -uct. Others show before and a/f_ter 
pictures of female celebrities with 
the caption “you aren’t ugly, you’re 
just poor. ” 
Disregarding the fact that 
beauty is relative and what we 
think of as beautiful is mostly so -
cietal, I believe there is an inter -
esting underlying message within 
these videos. As an online collec -
tive, we seem to have moved away 
from the idea of pretty versus ugly. 
While you can certainly still /f_ind 
evidence of a beauty hierarchy, 
nobody ever wants to say it out 
loud unless it is a condemnation 
of society. 
Instead, we have moved to -
wards a more discreet bias toward 
the beautiful. /T_he question of 
“What type of pretty am I?” intro -
duces a diﬀerent perspective: we 
are all beautiful in our own way. 
In some capacity, this change is 
a beautiful thing. So many people 
grew up with beauty being syn -
onymous with A-list actresses and 
supermodels, only to have their 
self-esteem plummet a/f_ter real -izing that they themselves would 
never look the same. /T_hat is a hard 
reality to face at such a young age. 
But this new movement assures 
us that we are all pretty in our 
own way, and we do not have to 
look like Kate Moss for that to be 
true. We have changed our mind -
sets and declared that everyone is 
beautiful. Or rather, everyone has 
beauty. 
While this is a lovely message, 
TikTok seems to have morphed it 
into something diﬀerent. Instead 
of us all being beautiful, point 
blank, the internet is trying to 
convince us that we all have beau -
ty that just needs to be coaxed out. 
/T_his is why we have to spend hun -
dreds of dollars on skincare prod -
ucts. /T_his is why we need to /f_ind 
our colors, our body type, and our 
aesthetic. /T_his is why you should 
not compare yourself to the rich: 
you do not have the same funds 
that they use to “uncover” their 
beauty. It is not that we are all 
beautiful, it is that we all have the 
capability to be beautiful with the right resources. 
/T_his, in itself, is a ginormous 
problem. While the mindset that 
“everyone is beautiful” is not in -
herently harmful because it boosts 
one’s self-esteem and con/f_idence, 
the idea that we all “could be beau -
tiful” does something completely 
diﬀerent. It convinces us that 
money is the answer; if you have 
enough wealth, you will be beau -
tiful. Beauty, it seems, is currency. 
And we buy it and trade it and use 
it as a means to an end. And that 
is far less romantic than saying ev -
eryone is beautiful. 
But looking further, there is 
an even bigger misunderstand -
ing at the root of this issue. Even 
disregarding the concept of beauty 
being advertised as an aspiration, 
the problem with “we are all beau -
tiful” is this: our “beauty within” is 
not physical beauty but the worth 
that we /f_ind within ourselves. 
I will clarify. /T_he internet is 
over/f_lowing with messages that 
scream “Y es, you are beautiful!” 
or “Y ou can become beautiful!” 
/gid00042/gid00076/gid00064/gid00070/gid00068/gid00001/gid00066/gid00078/gid00084/gid00081/gid00083/gid00068/gid00082/gid00088/gid00001/gid00078/gid00069/gid00001/gid00047/gid00072/gid00066/gid00071/gid00078/gid00075/gid00064/gid00082/gid00001/gid00044/gid00084/gid00082/gid00084/gid00076/gid00064/gid00001/gid00069/gid00081/gid00078/gid00076/gid00001/gid00054/gid00077/gid00082/gid00079/gid00075/gid00064/gid00082/gid00071 /gid00015with no one asking what happens 
if you are not beautiful. It is a hard 
question to ask because nobody 
wants to say that they, or anybody, 
are not pretty, and this is for an 
obvious reason: it is unkind. But, 
the question has to be asked. And 
not because this “unpretty person” 
is you, or me, or any one person 
out there. Rather, we have to ask 
because we need to know that 
we have worth even if we are not 
beautiful. I am not claiming that 
this is a new message, but it is one 
that should be heard. 
I recently did an exercise where 
I named the things I liked the most 
about myself, and I realized that 
beauty did not even make the top 
ten. Instead, I listed my ambition, 
my humor, my creativity, and my 
passion. My excellent tea-making 
skills, my lucky parking karma, 
and my dedication to making my 
bed every morning. All of these 
things that I love so much about 
myself make beauty seem so small 
and insigni/f_icant. And truly, what 
is beauty compared to all of that?FEATURES/C.cap/O.cap/N.cap/T.cap/A.cap/C.cap/T.cap /T.cap/H.cap/E.cap /E.cap/D.cap/I.cap/T.cap/O.cap/R.cap/S.cap

The Cogeneration Plant is Not Generating Sustainable 
Answers
By Nilou Shahbandi
/gid00015/gid00006/gid00024/gid00020/gid00001/gid00006/gid00005/gid00010/gid00021/gid00016/gid00019
“We /f_ight disease, climate 
change, and systemic racism, ” 
Chancellor Pradeep Khosla boast -
ed about UC San Diego in . In 
fact, sustainability is supposedly 
fabricated into the university’s 
DNA by the likes of Roger Rev -
elle and Charles Keeling. But of 
course, this sustainability promise 
excludes the small fact that UCSD 
emits 300,000 tonnes of carbon 
every year through the methane-
burning cogeneration plant ironi -
cally located in Revelle College. 
/T_he cogeneration plant is a 
30-megawatt, natural-gas-/f_ired 
combined heat and power system. 
/T_he plant has been in use since 
2001 and it is admittedly more ef -
/f_icient than other energy systems 
in its reduction of energy loss. It 
supplies 72% of the campus’s elec -
tricity needs annually, with the 
remainder of the electricity needs 
being imported from the local 
grid. But it’s also responsible for 
making UCSD the second-highest 
emitter of carbon emission among 
the 10 UC campuses, the /f_irst be -
ing UCLA. 
Catherina Gere, the chair of 
the committee on campus climate 
change and a professor in the his -
tory department, talked to /T_he 
UCSD Guardian about the origi -nal perks of the plant. 
“/T_he thinking then [in 2001] 
was that it was going to take de -
cades and decades for the United 
States to transition away from 
making electricity using fossil 
fuels, ” Gere said. “So the electri -
cal grid was not going to be de -
carbonized in the near future. 
And so their calculation was that 
making electricity on-site, which 
is what the cogeneration plant 
does, using fossil gas was actually 
the most energy-eﬃcient way to 
produce the energy for campus. ”
Y et these original motiva -
tions don’t change the fact that 
the plant burns over $10 million 
worth of fracked methane ev -
ery year. Methane, which is the 
main component of natural gas, 
is 80 times more powerful than 
carbon dioxide in warming the 
atmosphere.
“So the cogen plant has gas 
turbines which generate electric -
ity and also gas boilers, which 
generates steam, which then cre -
ates hot water, chilled water, and 
electricity for campus, ” /f_i/f_th-year 
doctorate student Alexander An -
driatis said. “So it’s a good sys -
tem relative to 1990 standards. 
But the world has moved on and 
there’s a climate crisis and there 
are climate goals. ”
Campus administrators are 
aware of the detrimental eﬀects 
of the plant, yet they have been slow to take action, citing costs 
and lack of funding for the lack of 
progress.
Leslie Sepuka, associate direc -
tor of university communications, 
told /T_he Guardian the /f_inancial 
obstacles of decommissioning the 
plant in exchange for a fossil-free 
option:
“With the goal of reducing car -
bon emissions in mind, the uni -
versity is exploring the feasibility 
of retiring the university’s natural-
gas-/f_ired cogeneration plant and 
converting to technologies that 
reduce the reliance on fossil fuel. 
Any conversion would require a 
plan, signi/f_icant funding, and a 
commitment from all segments of 
the UC San Diego community. ”
Y et funding does not seem to 
be an issue for other UCSD proj -
ects. /T_he university recently cel -
ebrated the end of a decade-long 
Campaign for UC San Diego that 
raised $3.05 billion dollars. More -
over, UCSD just broke ground on 
its $365 million dollar project to 
build the two tallest residential 
towers in the University of Cali -
fornia system. 
With such extravagant spend -
ing, many feel frustrated that the 
university, despite its promising 
slogans of sustainability, has its 
priorities elsewhere. Fi/f_th-year 
doctorate candidate Adam Coo -
per shared his perspective on the 
lack of action. “Once the university commits 
to it, they’ll get it done pretty fast, ” 
Cooper said. “Stanford committed 
to it. Six years later, they built two 
solar panels and they shut down 
their cogen plant and replaced it 
with electric pumps. Same thing 
happened to Arizona State and 
we’re seeing the same thing hap -
pen at Davis, and at Berkeley. So it 
really comes down to convincing 
leadership. I just don’t think the 
chancellor is prioritizing climate 
action on this campus and I don’t 
think he’s yet been convinced to be 
a leader in this regard. ”
One key component in the 
university’s hesitancy to retire the 
plant — which is not advertised 
as explicitly — is the remaining 
balance on the mortgage UCSD 
received to build the cogeneration 
plant in the /f_irst place.
According to the UC San Diego 
Climate Action Plan published in 
2019, the mortgage is planned to 
be paid oﬀ by 2032. /T_he Guardian 
contacted campus administrators 
regarding the mortgage and if it 
could be paid in full earlier than 
expected, but the administrators 
declined to comment.
Nevertheless, funding has 
been trickling in, not just through 
the university’s billion-dollar 
campaigns, but also by the state. 
In September 2022, UC President 
Michael V . Drake created a Fossil 
Free Pathways Task Force funded by money from the state to study 
and deliver plans to move away 
from fossil fuels on all UC cam -
puses. 
Adam Aron, co-founder of the 
UC Green New Deal coalition and 
professor in the psychology de -
partment, explained the celebra -
tory but insuﬃcient promise of 
the task force. 
“It’s a big and amazing win, 
but it’s by no means over, be -
cause there’s a gap between mak -
ing plans and actually doing any -
thing, ” Aron said. “Our worry is 
that they’ll make plans for years 
and years and years, like the city of 
San Diego made plans nine years 
ago and did nothing …We have 
this new campaign called ‘Kho -
sla Must Commit. ’ And we need 
him and we need the leadership at 
UCSD to not just make plans but 
to actually make commitments to 
get oﬀ the gas this decade. ”
With plans yet to be made 
for the Fossil Free Pathways Task 
Force, there’s not much else to 
look forward to. And with the uni -
versity’s great pride in its histori -
cal /f_inding of the Keeling Curve, 
one of the /f_irst pieces of public evi -
dence for linking global warming 
with the burning of fossil fuels, the 
expectations are set much higher. 
UCSD’s empty claims of sustain -
ability fall short of the promise it 
set out to ful/f_ill decades ago.@ucsdguardian

Tritons Down Mustangs, Extend Winning Streak to Three

UC San Diego Women’s Bas -
ketball (8–9, 5–2 Big West) de -
feated California Polytechnic Uni -
versity, San Luis Obispo (5–10, 
2–5 Big West) at LionTree Arena 
/T_hursday night, shooting 54% 
from the /f_ield in the second half 
en route to a 70–58 victory. A/f_ter 
squandering a 13 point lead in the 
second quarter, the Tritons took 
the lead early in the third and nev -
er looked back. Redshirt senior 
Julia Macabuhay led the Tritons 
with 18 points, adding a block and 
a steal to an incredible all-around 
performance. /T_he victory extend -
ed the Tritons’ winning streak to 
three games, placing the team 
fourth in the competitive Big West 
conference.
/T_he Tritons dominated the 
Mustangs early, racing to a 16–4 
lead in the /f_irst six minutes. Soph -
omore Izzy Forsyth opened the 
scoring with a neat reverse layup 
and Macabuhay added a close 
range /f_inish for her /f_irst points 
of the game. Junior Parker Mont -
gomery and graduate student 
Sydney Brown both made threes 
to contribute to UCSD’s early run. 
A/f_ter the Mustangs cut the de/f_icit 
to ten, Brown hit her second three 
pointer of the game to make it 
19–6 Tritons. Cal Poly closed the 
/f_irst quarter with three made free 
throws, but the Tritons entered 
the second period with a com -
manding 10 point advantage. 
/T_he second quarter proved 
/f_ickle, and momentum swung 
towards the Mustangs. A/f_ter Cal 
Poly opened the quarter with a 
layup, a Macabuhay corner three made it a 23–12 Triton lead. How -
ever, the rest of the period was all 
Cal Poly, as the Mustangs went on 
a 15–3 run in the /f_inal seven min -
utes of the half. /T_he Tritons shot 0 
for 8 during this period, including 
/f_ive missed threes. Five team fouls 
and /f_ive oﬀensive rebounds al -
lowed also contributed to UCSD’s 
woes defensively. /T_he Mustangs 
had stolen the lead back from the 
Tritons and headed into the locker 
room with a 27–26 advantage.
/T_he /f_irst /f_ive minutes of the 
third quarter were a back and 
forth aﬀair. Perhaps inspired by a 
/f_iery hal/f_time speech and a rau -
cous LionTree crowd, the Tritons 
went on a 6–0 run to open the 
half. Forsyth, Macabuhay, and 
Brown all had points in the paint 
to establish a /f_ive point Triton 
lead early in the third. Macabuhay 
added a chase down block and a 
fast break layup, taking advantage 
of a Sydney Brown steal. Cal Poly, 
however, responded with a crowd 
silencing and-one basket. Despite 
an electric start to the quarter, the 
Tritons found themselves in a tied 
game with /f_ive minutes le/f_t in the 
third.
/T_he Tritons closed out the 
quarter with a /f_iery performance. 
A/f_ter the Mustangs drew level, 
sophomore Bridget Mullens had 
two putback layups to reestablish a 
four point Triton lead. On the next 
possession, redshirt senior Emily 
Cangelosi hit an open three a/f_ter 
a passage of excellent Triton ball 
movement. A/f_ter the teams traded 
free throws, Forsyth made a three 
of her own to extend the lead to 
ten. Cangelosi and Forsyth’s three 
pointers came a/f_ter eight straight 
missed threes for the Tritons, 
swinging momentum in UCSD’s direction for the remainder of the 
game. Cal Poly responded with a 
made jumper from the elbow, but 
Cangelosi /f_inished an inside layup 
to end the quarter leading 50–40. 
/T_he fourth quarter was more 
of the same for the Tritons, who 
were never threatened by the 
Mustangs down the stretch. Af -
ter Cal Poly made it a /f_ive point 
game, UCSD shut the door on the 
Mustangs, ending on a 15–8 run. 
Mullens extended the Triton lead 
to seven a/f_ter two free throws. A 
couple of possessions later, gradu -
ate student Madison Baxter hit 
a dagger three a/f_ter some clever 
Triton passing. On the next Cal 
Poly possession, Macabuhay had 
a steal and a midrange jumper to make it a nine point game. A/f_ter a 
Mustang score, Macabuhay pulled 
up from deep three point range, 
further sinking the Mustangs. She 
completed her seven point run 
with a couple of free throws on the 
following possession. /T_he Tritons 
cruised for the /f_inal two minutes, 
holding their double digit lead for 
a /f_inal score of 70–58.
/T_he UCSD Guardian caught 
up with Coach Heidi VanDerveer 
a/f_ter the game, who looked back 
on the up-and-down win.
“We played really well in the 
/f_irst /f_ive minutes, rolling defen -
sively, hitting shots, and loosen -
ing up their defense … in the later 
parts of the [/f_irst half], we lost our 
way a little bit, ” VanDerveer said. “In the second half, our veterans 
just decided that this is not hap -
pening tonight, and I think that 
when they decide and lead our 
team, we are very good. ”
/T_he Tritons look to extend 
their winning streak to four 
against Long Beach State on Sat -
urday, avenging their 52–66 loss 
earlier this season, one of only 
two losses to conference oppo -
nents. A win on Saturday would 
see the Tritons move to third place 
in the Big West, trailing only UC 
Santa Barbara and UC Irvine. /T_he 
Tritons return to LionTree Arena 
next week, with two matchups 
against CSU Northridge and UC 
Riverside.

Triton Men’s Tennis Comes From Behind To Defeat 
Sacramento State 4-3
By Ishir Talapatra
/gid00004/gid00016/gid00015/gid00021/gid00019/gid00010/gid00003/gid00022/gid00021/gid00010/gid00015/gid00008/gid00001/gid00020/gid00017/gid00016/gid00019/gid00021/gid00020/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
A/f_ter going down 3–0, the 
UC San Diego men’s tennis team 
(2–2) went on a 4–0 run to de -
feat the Sacramento State Hornets 
(1–1). /T_he win marks the Tritons’ 
/f_irst win over Sacramento State in 
team history.
Coming oﬀ a tough loss against 
the University of San Francisco, 
the Tritons were in desperate need 
of a victory. In that matchup, the 
only winner that came out was a 
doubles game with sophomore 
Pelayo Rodriguez and senior 
Phillip Lan. /T_he Tritons played a 
hard-fought match against an ex -
perienced San Francisco squad, 
but were unable to stymie the mo -
mentum of the opposition in their 
/f_irst game of the season. 
UCSD started poorly, los -
ing both initial doubles matches 
to lose the doubles point and go 
down 1-0. Sacramento State’s 
Mark Keki won 6–1, 6–2 over 
UCSD’s senior Daniel Traxler to 
make it 2–0, and freshman Adam 
Chodur made it 3–0 for Sacra -
mento State with a 6–4, 6–4 win 
against freshman Diogo Tinoco. 
As Triton head coach Tim -
mer Willing told UCSD Athletics, 
“Our guys were asked a simple 
question: are you going to survive 
or surrender?” /T_he Tritons clearly 
chose survival, with sophomore 
Charles Qian making it 4-0 for 
his season so far and winning 6–2, 
6–1 to put UCSD on the board. 
Senior Phillip Lan made it 3-2 in the overall tally with a 6-1, 7-5 
win, and junior Jett Cole won a 
tight match 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 to level 
things out and set up a deciding 
matchup. 
/T_hese thrilling games put Sac -
ramento State on their heels when 
it seemed like UCSD had no hope 
to recover. /T_he convincing vic -tory by Qian put the Tritons right 
back in the mix of things with his 
consistently spectacular play. /T_he 
Tritons did struggle in the doubles 
matchups, losing all three matches 
and giving the Tritons an unfor -
tunate hole to manage. Players 
Rodriguez and Cole had diﬃcult 
showings in their doubles match, but each played a key role in the 
eventual victory. Rodriguez was 
given the chance to take the cru -
cial game and match for the Tri -
tons, and the young sophomore 
was more than ready to convert 
for his team. 
Sophomore Pelayo Rodriguez 
sent Triton hearts racing by los -ing the /f_irst set 4-6, but won a 
tightly contested second set 7–5. 
He then romped to victory in the 
third, 6-0, to seal a tight draw with 
Sacramento State by a 4–3 mar -
gin. /T_he miraculous comeback is 
something this program can build 
on as they move forward this sea -
son. Con/f_idence and rhythm is 
important for the team’s improve -
ment, and this performance was 
one step closer to a complete per -
formance from the entire team. 
“/T_hey chose to stay out and 
just compete, ” Willing added a/f_ter 
the matches were complete. “Sac -
ramento State is a very talented 
and tough team, and we happened 
to hold on and take it with some 
eﬀective crucial point play. ” 
Willing was obviously proud of 
his team’s ability to stay the course 
and scrap to victory. Not every 
team has the constitution to /f_ind 
a way to win a/f_ter a disappointing 
loss the day prior and consecutive 
losses to start the day, but the ef -
fort that the Tritons put on display 
must bode well for the rest of the 
season. Performances by players 
like Rodriguez and Cole show the 
gutsiness that this team will need 
to embody to meet their lo/f_ty 
goals. 
A/f_ter an impressive victory, 
the Tritons will look to keep their 
momentum high on their upcom -
ing road trip. /T_he Tritons face 
Loyola Marymount at home on 
Jan. 29 at 1 p.m., before a road trip 
next weekend to Santa Clara and 
the University of the Paci/f_ic.
