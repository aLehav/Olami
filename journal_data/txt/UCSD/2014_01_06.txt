All 10 UC Campuses 
Implement Smoking BanUC Venture 
Capital Firm
Verdict  
OverturnedUC  S Y STEM
San Diego State joins the UC campuses in prohibiting the 
sale and use of tobacco products beginning Jan. 1.
Each of the ten UC campuses has gone “smoke-
free” as of Jan. 1, following UCSD’s implemen -
tation of the tobacco ban on Sept. 1., 2013. 
Additionally, San Diego State University enforced a 
similar smoking ban starting Jan. 1. 
The regulations of the SDSU ban are similar to 
those of the UC system, prohibiting all tobacco use, 
sale and sponsorship. Unlike the other nine UC cam -
puses, UC Irvine’s ban on smoking will allow the use 
of e-cigarettes and chewing tobacco.
SDSU’s ban comes after a policy designating 12 
smoking areas, which was largely unsuccessful. Thus 
far there have been no formal measurements of the 
effectiveness of the tobacco ban at UCSD.However, UCSD Executive Director of Student 
Health and Well-being Karen Calfas thinks that a 
decrease in smoking is noticeable on campus.
“That isn’t to say there aren’t places where people 
aren’t occasionally smoking, but this is our transition 
period and so I think it’s been very effective, ” Calfas 
said. “We are working with other campuses to do a 
system-wide measurement, but the other campuses 
just went smoke-free so we’re still working out what 
that will be. ”
UCLA became the first smoke-free campus in 
April, the only UC campus other than UCSD to ban 
tobacco before Jan. 1.

See SMOKE-FREE , page 3A state appellate court 
ruled the UC system 
does not have to disclose 
financial documents.
A state appellate court ruled on Dec. 
19 that the University of California 
was not required to produce financial 
documents from two venture capital 
firms detailing information on UC 
investments. This decision overruled 
an earlier judgment from February of 
2013 wherein the Alameda County 
Superior Court ordered the univer -
sity to “make an objectively reasonable 
effort” to provide the details to the 
Reuters America news agency, under 
the California Public Record Act.
“We are obviously disappointed 
by the court’s ruling and continue 
to believe the records are not only 
in the public interest but should be 
disclosed under the California Public 
Records Act, ” Reuters spokesperson 
Barb Burg said according to the Daily 
Californian. 
Court documents report that 
Reuters editor Mark Boslet original -
ly requested that the University of 
California reveal confidential fund-
level performance data about Sequoia 
Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield 
and Byers, two venture capital firms 
that the university had worked with 
in the past. The university refused, 
stating that it no longer had access to

ACADEMI C  AFF AIRS
Women Lead in UC and 
CSU Graduation Rates 
A recent report announced a reversal in trends as 
women outperform men in enrollment and graduation.
Women are now outperform -
ing their male counterparts in pre -
paredness for college and in rates of 
enrollment and graduation, accord -
ing to a recent report released by the 
Campaign for College Opportunity. 
The report, titled “The State of Higher 
Education in California: The Gender 
and Racial Gap Analysis, ” announced 
that the reversal in trend is now true 
for women from all ethnic groups.
Despite the improvement in the 
rate of women attending college, the 
dwindling rate of young men’s enroll -
ment in college is worrisome to Solano 
Community College President Jowel 
Laguerre, who has been following the 
reports for almost two decades.
“It is a disturbing trend, ” Laguerre 
said in a Dec. 27 article in the Vallejo 
Times Herald. “We want for as many women to go to college; but we also 
need young men to do the same. ”
In the report, the Campaign for 
College Opportunity’s data shows 
that the gender education gap usually 
begins in high school with a greater 
number of women taking courses to 
meet requirements for college enroll -
ment than men. In college, the gap 
becomes more defined as students 
approach graduation. 
For example, the report shows that 
women graduate from the California 
State University system at an aver -
age of five to eight percent higher 
than males while in the University of 
California system, women graduate at 
an average of six percent higher than 
their male counterparts.
The report also found that educa -
tion gaps by race persist. Although

▶  San Diego Chargers Win:  The San 
Diego Chargers will advance to the 
AFC semifinals after taking down 
the Cincinnati Bengals 27–10 on the 
road, Jan. 5. The Bolts capitalized on 
four Bengal turnovers and outscored 
Cincinnati 20–0 in the second half. 
Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers 
threw for 118 yards and a touchdown 
while running back Ronnie Brown 
rushed for a team-high of 77 yards and 
a touchdown.
The Chargers will play the Broncos 
in Denver next week with a trip to the 
AFC championship on the line.
▶ Napolitano to Lead U.S. Olympic 
Delegation:  UC President Janet 
Napolitano will lead the U.S. dele -
gation at the opening ceremony of 
the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, 
Russia. It will be Napolitano’s second 
time leading a U.S. delegation at the 
Olympic games.
“I look forward to being in Sochi 
to support our Olympic athletes and 
celebrate their accomplishments, ” 
Napolitano said in a Dec. 17 press release. “It is an honor to represent our 
country in the company of individuals 
who have excelled in life and sport. ”
The delegation will be the first 
since the 2000 Summer Olympic 
Games that will not include the presi -
dent, vice president or first lady.
▶UCSD Cardiologists Perform First 
Robotic Surgery:  UCSD’s interven -
tional cardiology team performed 
California’s first robotically assist -
ed coronary procedure this past 
December. The team, led by Chief of 
Cardiovascular Medicine and Director 
of the SCVC-Medicine Dr. Ehtisham 
Mahmud, conducted the procedure 
at the UCSD Sulpizio Cardiovascular 
Center with the new robotic system, 
which acts as an “extra hand” to hold 
cardiac devices in place. 
“Sitting a few feet away from the 
patient’s bedside at a computerized 
work station, I was able to navigate and 
advance the guidewire, balloon cath -
eter and stent through the coronary 
artery, ” Mahmud, said.
“The ability to accurately measure lesion length with this technology 
enabled me to identify the exact length 
of the stents required and precisely 
place them. ”
This technology also ultimately 
results in a shorter procedure time and 
less radiation exposure to the operator.
“A s  t h e  o n l y  c o m p r e h e n s i v e  a c a -
demic health system in the region, 
we are honored to be the first hospital 
in the state to deliver this technol -
ogy to patients and the community, ” 
Mahmud said.
▶ Colleges Reject Israel Boycott:  
American colleges and universities 
will reject an academic boycott of 
Israeli universities recently approved 
by the American Studies Association. 
Some schools said they are now with -
drawing from the organization. 
“ An academic boycott goes 
against the spirit of the University of 
California, which has long champi -
oned open dialogue and collabora -
tion with international scholars, ” UC 
President Janet Napolitano said in a 
statement on Dec. 30. ’’Of the 1,252 votes submitted by 
the 5000 member association, 66.05 
percent approved the boycott.
“The ASA endorses and will honor 
the call of Palestinian civil society for 
a boycott of Israeli academic institu -
tions, ” the boycott stated. “It is also 
resolved that the ASA supports the 
protected rights of students and schol -
ars everywhere to engage in research 
and public speaking about Israel-
Palestine and in support of the boycott, 
divestment and sanctions movement. ”
Chancellor Pradeep K. Khosla 
issued a statement that UCSD does not 
support the boycott.
“We affirm the right of the fac -
ulty to advance their scholarship and 
research through open dialogue with 
academic colleagues in all countries, ” 
Khosla said. “UC San Diego faculty 
collaborations draw on richly diverse 
ideas and views around the globe, 
including in the Middle East. ”
Johns Hopkins, Harvard, Yale, 
Cornell, Princeton and Boston 
University objected to the boycott 
as well.

/ucsdguardianLatino ethnic groups outpace their 
male counterparts, they still trail 
behind other ethnic groups. For 
instance, the report cites that 61 per -
cent of white females graduate from 
the CSU system within six years but 
only 38 percent of African American 
women and 47 percent of Latino 
women do. 
The performance differences 
among ethnic groups and gender is 
recognized as a challenging obstacle 
facing higher education today. As the research and policy analyst for 
Campaign for College Opportunity, 
Nadia Valliani is in charge of prepar -
ing the report and understands the 
importance of raising public awareness 
through the report she helped release.
“We produce reports and then we 
send these reports and infographics 
to different staffers and legislators so 
they’re aware of the issue, ” Valliani 
said. “We also promote in the media so 
people are aware that there is this gap. ”
Executive Director of the 
Campaign for College Opportunity 
Michele Siqueiros hopes that the report will spur Californians to action.
“The figures make clear that 
California must address the growing 
inequality in college enrollment and 
degree completion, ” Siqueiros told 
the Vallejo Times Herald. “This is 
not just a problem for men, or blacks 
or Latinos; this imbalance affects all 
Californians. We all benefit when all 
of our young people have access to 
a college education and the tools to 
succeed and graduate. ” court decision ordering it to reveal 
similar performance reports to the San 
Jose Mercury News. Since then, the 
two firms allowed the UC to continue 
investing only if they did not have to 
provide such data. The university now 
relies on other information to gauge 
the status of its private equity invest -
ments.
After the university’s refusal, 
Reuters filed a lawsuit in January 
2012. The trial court mandated that 
the university should make a reason -
able effort to obtain the documents 
from the firms, arguing that they had “constructive possession. ” However, 
the Court of Appeals rejected this 
because the requested data did not 
fall under “public records” or “con -
structive possession” as defined by the 
CPRA, according to a UC Newsroom 
release. The appellate court has now 
ruled that the University of California 
was not obligated to retrieve records 
that were not “prepared, owned, 
used or retained” by the regents.  
 In the same press release , UC 
General Counsel Charles Robinson 
said, “We believe today’s decision by 
the Court of Appeal is the correct one. 
It will allow our investment profes -
sionals to make and monitor private equity investments without intrusion 
from third parties seeking confiden -
tial and sensitive information for their 
own commercial ends. ”
The University of California stated 
that the lower ruling would have put 
a difficult burden on public agencies 
if it were not overturned. The univer -
sity relies on private equity firms like 
Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins 
Caufield and Byers for high-risk, high-
reward investments that have success -
fully provided large returns for endow -
ment and retirement funds.NE W S  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , JANUARY 6, 2014 | WWW. UCSDGUARDIAN .ORG 3
UCLA, ” Calfas said. “I anticipate that 
the other UCs will have the same suc -
cess. We’re all looking forward to how 
that’s going to play out. ”
California has many restrictions on 
smoking in public places compared 
to other states; other public school 
campuses other than University of California campuses have begun 
adopting similar policies, although not 
on a system-wide level.
“I suspect that other CSUs are or 
will soon be smoke-free as well, ” Calfas 
said. “In San Diego, many of the com -
munity colleges have been smoke-free 
for a while now. ”
Calfas also noted the recent increase 
in smoke-free campuses nationwide.“When we first wrote a proposal 
to consider this as a system, there 
were 500 or 700 schools that were 
smoke free, ” Calfas said. “Now there 
are 1,000 to 1,200. I think we’re going 
to see many universities throughout 
the nation take this step. ”

QUICK TAKESCOLORADO’S LEGALIZATION OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA HAS REOPENED THE 
DRUG POLICY DEBATE, WITH SOME STATES CONTEMPLATING SIMILAR LEGISLATION.
Liberal Marijuana Legislation Shows Economic

Colorado’s new marijuana policy is a progressive move 
to increase tax revenue and shows a sense of practicality in 
regards to the state’s recreational consumption of pot.
Colorado voters are wise to realize that the money spent 
enforcing laws against marijuana is not well spent. In 2012, 
the United States had 749,825 federal arrests for marijuana 
law violations, while 658,231 were for possession. These 
numbers represent significant amounts of time and effort 
of law enforcement put into punishing people for pos -
session, use and cultivation of a drug that has not been 
proven to be particularly harmful. 
The new law finally allows the state to profit from tax -
ing all weed sold in Colorado. According to the Colorado 
Department of Revenue, Colorado was able to gain $9.1 
million in tax revenue from the $326 million generated 
by the sale of medical marijuana in 2013. Researchers at 
Colorado State University predict that revenue from mari -
juana tourism could potentially reach $606 million in tax -
able sales in 2014 alone. The large sum of money generated 
from taxing the drug in a similar fashion to alcohol and 
cigarettes could, in turn, be used for improving state pro -
grams like education and infrastructure. 
Contrary to arguments that legalizing marijuana will 
increase drug use and dependency among minors, other 
countries have adopted legalization without experienc -
ing such problems. In the 20 plus years since marijuana 
has been legal in the Netherlands, there has been no dra -
matic escalation in the use and consumption of the drug. 
According to the Drug Policy Alliance, the rates of mari -
juana use in the Netherlands for different age groups are 
similar to those in the United States, but for adolescents, 
rates of marijuana use are actually lower in the Netherlands 
than in the United States. 
While it’s unclear how legalization will play out in the 
rest of the United States, marijuana’s international track 
record suggests a likely positive outcome for Colorado. 
—  CHARU MEHRA
Staff WriterAs the first state to legalize both the sale and use of marijuana, 
Colorado’s new policy is an important gateway to the integration 
and stabilization of recreational marijuana in American culture. 
Colorado’s first steps will not only strongly influence future gov -
ernment policies regarding legalized medical and recreational 
marijuana in the United States, but can negatively impact future 
generations’ use and views of the drug.
On Dec. 30, 2013, The Huffington Post reported that after 
a positive review on the Marijuana Control, Legalization and 
Revenue Act from California Attorney General Kamala Harris, 
a California initiative to legalize the use and sales of weed might 
come to the 2014 ballot. Similarly, Mason Tvert of the Marijuana 
Policy Project notes that pro-recreational marijuana state initiatives 
are expected in 2016 by Alaska, Arizona, Maine, Massachusetts 
and Nevada, showing that legalization of the drug in the United 
States may become a nationwide trend in 2014.
And legalization will only increase adolescents’ accessibility 
to the drug. Though pot is less harmful than already legal sub -
stances like alcohol and tobacco, cannabis is not without its own 
set of health and safety drawbacks for adolescents. According 
to the American Medical Association, early use of cannabis by 
adolescents impairs neurobiological performance, while heavy 
users display “increased rates of anxiety, mood and psychotic 
thought disorders. ” While Colorado’s regulations limit sales to 
individuals over the age of 21, it’s naive to believe that marijuana 
won’t assimilate itself into American culture in a similar fashion 
to alcohol amongst teens and college students. The AMA also 
notes that weed is also the most common illicit drug involved in 
drugged driving, particularly used by those under 21.
Although Colorado is simply a testing ground for regulated 
marijuana sales, the unprecedented policy has sparked discus -
sions to legalize recreational pot in other states. The decisions 
will ultimately come down to voters in each state, but indi -
viduals should consider the cultural implications of legalizing 
weed before glorifying projected tax revenue and new tourist 
locations.

That I
Can’t Really   
Believe In
kel vin  noronha   
knoronha@ucsd.eduThinking Caps
As expected, New Year’s Day 
was heralded by brightly 
optimistic pledges and 
resolutions with a flurry of skepti -
cism in return. In spite of all the 
holiday spirit, though, I stray away 
from the idea of resolutions like a 
frightened rabbit. It’s not because 
I particularly lack mental strength, 
though the smell of chocolate chip 
cookies can easily lure me from any 
ill-advised fitness goals. It’s mainly 
because humans are terrified of 
change; such monumental undertak -
ings may as well be advertising their 
own peril.
Although changes in our rou -
tines or our environments are 
neurally stimulating, they set off all 
kinds of natural alarm bells. We’re 
adept at noticing even the tiniest 
changes around us; if something 
substantial changes, we go on red 
alert. We tend to have a xenophobic 
sort of suspicion. If there happens 
to be a different dish in our lunch, 
and we later feel ill, our bodies 
implicate the newcomer, and we 
are conditioned to hate it forever. 
While this could backfire and give 
us an aversion to something as 
innocent as Nutella, these ultimate -
ly help us avoid poisoning, preda -
tion or a host of other hazards.
This plays into the classic “if it 
ain’t broke” maxim, which operates 
under similar circumstances. In the 
case of New Year resolutions, we 
may be loath to do away with every -
thing we’re used to in favor of some 
random unquantifiable “improve -
ment. ” Our resistance to change is 
the phenomenon of operant condi -
tioning acting on a grand scale. If 
we’re still breathing and still have a 
pulse, we tend to treat it as a suc -
cess that doesn’t need to be fiddled 
with. Our survival encourages us 
to retain the behaviors that have 
worked, as long as nothing cata -
strophic happens. Consequently, a 
resolution to say  “thank you” more 
frequently in 2014 may not work if 
we’ve gotten away with ingratitude 
our whole lives.
This is all compounded by a 
certain amount of natural behav -
ioral inertia. There’s no motivation 
to put effort into something new, 
especially when it will involve a 
concerted struggle. The noble yet 
difficult thought of abandoning 
sweets for a month is just dandy 
until you actually try it. It’s particu -
larly difficult when you realize that 
even with your decadence you’re 
still fit enough to walk to class, 
or at least to the shuttle stop. And 
we don’t necessarily feel especially 
rejuvenated in the new year. Just 
like our birthday, realization that 
being 19 feels identical to being 18, 
merely replacing our wall calendar 
has no real correlation to changing 
anything about ourselves.
But this lazy indolence is solv -
able. If we really decide that we 
want to make a difference in our 
otherwise comfy lives, we can 
just trick ourselves into action by 
enacting the change piece by piece. 
The smaller the magnitude of the 
change, the more likely we’ll be able 
to deal with it. Just one less In-n-
Out burger per month and voila, 
we’re practically vegetarians by 
September. Baby steps do have their 
merits — you get to congratulate 
yourself for a whole lot longer.     WEEDING OUT THE  CONTROVERSYLast quarter, I took a class 
at the Rady School of 
Management that con -
ducted all examinations online. We 
brought our laptops to class to take 
an online multiple choice midterm 
and final through a website. Our 
professor ensured us that this way, 
grading would be done easily, and 
scores would be revealed instantly. 
Oh, if only it were that simple. 
The class had technical difficul -
ties to get both 
online exams 
going, delaying 
each by at least 
30 minutes, on 
our test days. But 
this wasn’t the only time misspent; 
using the website started several 
debates and discussions regarding 
the option of being able to look 
back on and change past responses 
on the website’s exam. 
And I’m not bitter or annoyed 
just because I got a below average 
grade on the exam, but because as 
I sat there waiting — and wishing I 
was taking a basic Scantron and #2 
pencil exam — I became more con -
vinced that not all problems can be 
solved through technology. 
In response to criticisms of its 
increasingly crowded classrooms 
and previous lack of online course 
options, the UC system now offers 
cross-campus online classes avail -
able to any UC student meeting eli -
gibility requirements, starting this 
quarter. The new $10 million pilot 
program currently has 11 different 
classes ranging from computer sci -
ence to elementary Spanish taught 
by professors from four different 
UC campuses. While these web 
courses may actually be efficient for 
students (unlike my class’s online 
exams), opening up virtual seats is not the solution for overcrowding 
and delayed degree completion at 
the UC campuses. 
Courses on home campuses are 
too often filled to more than capac -
ity. As more classes and programs 
become impacted, students are 
packed into lecture halls like cattle, 
and it’s not uncommon to see some 
sitting on the floor due to the lack 
of seats. Last quarter, Genetics 
filled both Peterson Hall 108 and 
110, where some 
watched their 
professor’s live 
stream from the 
other classroom. 
These are valid 
and real problems that students 
should not have to deal with, but 
an online course is not the equiva -
lent of a traditional one with a live, 
lecturing professor and physical 
resources available on campus for 
students to utilize. 
For online courses, students are 
limited to emails to ask questions 
and cannot participate in lectures 
or attend office hours. UC adminis -
trators shouldn’t use online courses 
as a cop out for offering more class -
es on actual campuses. As students, 
we pay for a quality UC education, 
and we should be given just that; 
if we wanted to take online classes 
instead of on-campus classes, we 
could enroll in private online insti -
tutions for a fraction of the price.
Unlike my online exams, these 
cross-campus online classes may 
be somewhat more convenient or 
flexible for students but they come 
at the expense of quality. The UC 
system’s new initiative acts as an 
experiment, but I won’t be sur -
prised if, like many new technolo -
gy-based systems, the program cre -
ates more problems than it solves. o PI n Ion  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , JANUARY 6, 2014 | WWW. UCSDGUARDIAN .ORG 5

66 THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , JANUARY 6, 2014 | WWW. UCSDGUARDIAN .ORG 
FEATURESCONTACT THE EDITOR

the  Real  World   of  computer  science
Facebook’s Open Academy, a program that pairs computer science students 
with open source projects for academic credit, has expanded to UCSD.
UCSD’s computer science department has been a leader in its field since the late ‘70s and ‘80s, 
when our university gained worldwide recognition for the UCSD Pascal language program -
ming system — a portable, mostly machine-independent operating system that was used by 
both universities and high profile companies like Apple and IBM. Thirty years later, UCSD con -
tinues to help pave the way in computer science by offering Open Academy, a program that allows 
computer science students to work on open source projects for course credit this winter quarter.
“Open source” refers to a project or system whose code is made universally available for use, 
modification and redistribution. The Open Academy program begins with a weekend workshop, 
where students and mentors come together for a crash course in working with computer code at 
Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. When they return to their home universities, stu -
dents apply their learning to actual open source projects, working in virtual teams while receiving 
support from their mentors.
Open Academy was launched in the spring of 2013 by Facebook in collaboration with Stanford 
computer science professor Jay Borenstein. Already, universities from around the world have 
adopted the program, which is currently only operating through participating institutions such 
as UC Berkeley, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Texas at Austin and 
the University of Tokyo.
With a virtual mentor providing help in place of a teacher’s assistant, much more responsi -
bility rests in the students’ hands. A main facet of Open Academy is its encouragement of stu -
dents to discover and learn on their own through real-world application, emphasizing student 
independence.
“These projects have an established code base, which means students have the very real-world 
experience of having to learn their way around the structure of the code and get to the point where 
they can contribute, ” Borenstein said in an email to the Guardian. “This is something that software 
engineers do numerous times in their careers, so it’s a great skill to practice in school. ”
Stanford graduate student Noam Ben-Avi, who enrolled in Open Academy during his senior 
year of undergraduate studies at Stanford, shared about his experience with the program and how it differs from standard computer science classes.
“When I took [the class], I truly felt like for the first time at Stanford, I was doing real software 
development, ” he said in an email to the Guardian. “Working on the cutting edge of technology [at 
Open Academy] ... is a vast contrast to working on old technologies and rehashed assignments. ”
Instead of taking a computer science class in which the errors are planned in advance so stu -
dents can catch them and in which the projects are isolated, Ben-Avi said, Open Academy allows 
students to learn in actual scenarios where there is no preplanned solution and where the projects 
are interrelated. Furthermore, he noted that the access to ongoing open-source projects means that 
students are working with the most current problems to produce up-to-date solutions.
Aside from providing students with practical experience, Borenstein believes that the program 
benefits computer science majors in a much more fundamental way. He explained how the pro -
gram can help students make the right career choices.
“It’s helpful for students [to evaluate] what they want to do after school, ” he said. “Being in this 
kind of course gives students a true sense of what it means to be a software engineer. I think this 
helps people make more informed career decisions. ”
The importance of Open Academy and programs like it lies in enhancing student contribution 
as early as possible. Eligibility for the program requires being a full-time computer science student 
at a participating university. Interested students can email openacademy@fb.com to get the name 
of UCSD’s faculty champion, an on-campus representative who can then give more information 
to become a part of the program.
“For fun, for your resume, for the world, whatever it is: Contribute, ” Ben-Avi said. “Once you 
get through that very first contribution and all the confusion that goes with it, the floodgates really 
do open up, and you can become the next generation of programmer, one that isn’t limited by tools 
presented to him, but rather one that can evolve the tools to his needs as he develops. If we can do 
that, I think the next generation of computation is going to be limitless. ”

Visit   OUR  W eBsiteA Drive to Carpool
Two Rady alumni have launched a campaign called Fill the Car in an effort to encourage UCSD commuters to carpool to campus.
The difficulty of finding a park -
ing spot on campus may be UCSD 
students’ single biggest collective 
complaint. In hopes of improving 
the parking shortage — and pro -
moting environmental sustainabil -
ity — two graduates of UCSD’s Rady 
School of Management, Drew Beal 
and Mike Taylor, have launched a 
car-sharing campaign this quarter 
called Fill the Car. 
Fill the Car aims to encour -
age students to carpool to school 
and decrease the total number of 
vehicles coming to campus each 
day. The campaign officially begins 
today and will run through Mar. 16.
Students can participate in the 
campaign by taking a photo of their 
carpool group of two or more indi -
viduals going to school and entering raffles by submitting a maximum 
of one photo per day to FilltheCar.
com. Fill the Car will hold 10 raffles, 
one every week. Each winner, select -
ed at random, will win a free auto 
detailing from Mossy Toyota, a San 
Diego-area car dealership, valued at 
$200. Additionally, at the end, one 
grand-prize winner will receive an 
Apple iPad and an auto detailing 
from Mossy Toyota, valued at $600. 
But Fill the Car may provide 
additional incentives for students 
to carpool.
“We’re working with some com -
panies in the community to pro -
vide free stuff, whether it’s free oil 
changes, discounts at an auto store 
or free parking on campus, ” Beal 
said. “There will be random times 
where we will catch people carpool -
ing to campus with a group of three 
or more, and we’ll reward them. ”
Fill the Car is modeled after last 
spring’s Kill the Cup campaign, a social venture that Beal and Taylor headed to 
promote the use of reusable cups when 
purchasing coffee on campus.
While some may think that add -
ing more parking spots would solve 
the parking issue on campus, Beal 
feels that this may not be the best 
solution. According to Beal, in addi -
tion to the high costs of building 
parking structures, maintenance 
for these buildings can cost up to 
$20,000 per spot. 
Beal said that the goal of the cam -
paign is to significantly decrease the 
number of single occupancy vehicles 
and to increase the average number of 
people per carpool at UCSD.
This Thursday from 11 a.m. to 
2 p.m., Fill the Car will be hosting 
a kickoff event in the courtyard 
between Peet’s Coffee & Tea and the 
Rady School of Management. By   ky l e   m cv e y

Stopping Overdose, One Pill at a Time
Prescription drug overdoses killed more U.S. citizens 
than car accidents last year, taking the life of one 
American every 19 minutes, according to the Clinton 
Health Matters Initiative. College students, in particular, 
are at greater risk as indicated by a skyrocketing in abuse 
of drugs among the group — a 343 percent increase in 
abuse of opioids like Vicodin and a 93 percent increase 
in abuse of stimulants like Adderall between 1993 and 
2005, according to CHMI. 
As published in UCSD’s 2013 Annual Security 
Report, our university has seen an overall rise in drug 
law arrests and discipline from 2010 to 2012. In 2012, 
there were 25 reported drug law arrests and 588 reported 
accounts of drug law discipline, a significant increase 
from the 16 reports of arrest and 94 reports of discipline 
two years prior.
“Compared to the other commonly abused illicit 
drugs, prescription drugs are unique in that they can be 
obtained through legal channels, ” CHMI stated on its 
website. “These drugs have become attractive to drug 
seekers and abusers, because they are manufactured 
legitimately and prescribed by physicians, giving 
them the illusion of safety. In reality, the addiction 
and withdrawal associated with the abuse of many 
prescription drugs can be more harmful than that 
associated with illegal drugs. ”
As a result, the CHMI is partnering with the Jed 
Foundation, Facebook and MTV to spread awareness 
and create a prescription drug abuse prevention 
campaign for college students. The campaign would provide resources to campuses to jump-start their own 
prevention programs, counseling and mental health 
services and student-led efforts against prescription 
drug abuse. 
“Over the next five years, the Clinton Health Matters 
Initiative plans to save over 10,000 lives by cutting in half 
the number of young people who misuse prescription 
drugs for the first time, ” CHMI stated in their 2014 
“Deadly Dose” infographic.
 The CHMI seeks to attack prescription drug abuse 
by understanding it from the financial, social and health 
perspectives. According to the Substance Abuse and 
Mental Health Services Administration, 72 percent of 
prescription drug abusers get their pills from friends 
and family. Moreover, college students in a study by 
Christian J. Teter, et al. titled, “Illicit Use of Specific 
Prescription Stimulants Among College Students: 
Prevalence, Motives, and Routes of Administration, ” 
cited the following reasons for their prescription 
drug abuse: to concentrate better, earn higher grades, 
minimize stress and get high.
After social and academic pressures get to students, 
prescription abuse often leads to addiction, which in turn 
is likely to lead to overdose. This addiction, consequently, 
is a major factor in the tripling of overdoses in the past 
20 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention.
“ A person who is abusing prescription painkillers 
might take larger doses to achieve a euphoric effect 
and reduce withdrawal symptoms, ” CHMI stated in a 
2013 prescription drug misuse Q-and-A. “These larger 
doses can cause breathing to slow down so much that 
breathing stops, resulting in a fatal overdose. ”
Abuse of stimulants also results in addiction in a similar way to the abuse of painkillers, according to the 
CDC. 
“ All stimulants work by increasing dopamine levels 
in the brain — dopamine is a brain chemical (or 
neurotransmitter) associated with pleasure, movement 
and attention, ” CHMI stated in their Q-and-A. “However, 
when taken in doses and routes other than those 
prescribed, stimulants can increase brain dopamine in a 
rapid and highly amplified manner — as do most other 
drugs of abuse — disrupting normal communication 
between brain cells, producing euphoria and increasing 
the risk of addiction. ” 
Most of the reasons for prescription drug abuse 
that college students reported in the Teter study can be 
addressed through counseling and raising awareness, 
which CHMI is trying to achieve at college campuses 
across the nation. In addition to reaching out to 
campuses, CHMI plans to work with businesses, the 
pharmaceutical industry and various medical groups 
to improve prescription drug monitoring and lower the 
cost of anti-opiate drugs that could counter the damages 
of overdosing.
In support of its aims, CHMI will host a Health 
Matters Conference Jan. 13 to Jan. 15 in La Quinta, Calif. 
The conference will be broadcasted live online on the 
Clinton Foundation website. 
UCSD is also dedicated to providing support 
for students and faculty members who suffer from 
substance abuse. Psychological and Counseling 
Services provides counseling for those who need help 
with drug-dependency problems. They can be reached 
at (858) 534-3755.The Clinton Health Initiative is embarking on a campaign to prevent a projected 10,000 college students from dying of prescription drug abuse.

didn’t get stops when we needed to and 
turned the ball over too many times. ”
UCSD regrouped the following 
day against Chico State.
Senior forward Erin Dautremont 
and junior guard Miranda Seto 
powered the offense against Chico 
State. Dautremont, a four-year start -
er and 2013 All-CCAA selection, 
earned a double-double, 18 points 
on top of 11 rebounds. While Seto, 
fully recovered from an injury sus -
tained early in December, earned 
19 points, going 9-of-10 from the 
free-throw line.
UCSD took an early lead that was quickly cut down due in large part 
to the efforts of Chico’s Courtney 
Hamilton, a shooting guard who 
has caused trouble for the Tritons 
in the past. With the Wildcats up by 
11 points midway into the first half, 
Seto and Dautremont went to work. 
Combining for 14 points in the last 
five minutes of the match, the pair 
pushed to take a two-point lead by 
the end of the first period. 
“I thought that the people on the 
floor decided that when we were 
down [11 points] that we were bet -
ter than that, and they responded, ” 
VanDerveer said to the UCSD 
Athletics Department after the game.
VanDerveer kept her starters on the court through the better part of 
the second half, with Dautremont 
and senior guard Megan Perry both 
playing 39 of the 40-minute contest. 
“You don’t have possessions to 
waste in a game like this, and I think 
the people on the floor really gave us 
the best chance to win, ” VanDerveer 
said.
The Tritons will wrap up their 
five-game homestand this week. On 
Friday, UCSD will face Cal State 
East Bay — tied for first in the 
CCAA — and will take on a winless 
Cal State Monterey Bay on Saturday.

The UCSD women’s basketball 
team was busy over the last weekend 
of winter break, losing to Cal State 
Stanislaus 78–69 on Friday, Jan. 3, 
before upsetting No. 21 nationally 
ranked Chico State 76–65. 
Against Cal State Stanislaus — 
currently tied for first place in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association, with a 5–1 record — the 
Tritons suffered through an ugly loss, 
conceding 19 turnovers and shooting 
just 37 percent from the field. 
“We had some chances in the 
first half to hit some shots that we 
normally hit, and we were playing 
at a tempo that was a little uncom -
fortable for us, ” head coach Heidi 
VanDerveer said. “We just didn’t get 
it done. ”
The game remained close in the 
first half, but in the second period, 
Stanislaus forwards Lauren Godde 
and Riley Holladay got hot. The 
two recorded 16 points each and 
combined for 20 points in the sec -
ond half. 
“We had more shots than they did, 
outrebounded them, took more free-
throws, ” VanDerveer said. “But we

The UCSD men’s volleyball team began its 2014 campaign 
at the 50th Annual UC Santa Barbara Asics Invitational.
The Tritons finished fourth at the 10-team tournament, 
going 2–2 in group play last Friday, Jan. 3, before falling to host 
No. 8 UC Santa Barbara in the third-place game on Saturday.
“The pool play gave us the option to mix the lineups up and 
to get some guys on the court who may be new or don’t have as 
much experience, ” UCSD head coach Kevin Ring said. “I was 
pleased with how we played on Friday, and I thought we served 
well and our passing held up. ”
The Tritons played four best-of-three games on Friday, 
losing their first match 2–1 to Cal State Long Beach, 
who went undefeated throughout the tournament. UCSD 
rebounded to sweep Indiana University-Purdue Fort Wayne 
before losing to UCLA in straight sets. Needing to beat Cal 
State Northridge in order to advance to the third-place game, 
the Tritons came from behind in the third set to take the win.
“It was also good to see that we won a couple close games, ” 
Ring said. “ Against Cal State Northridge, we knew that if we didn’t 
win we would have finished in fifth place. We knew the circum -
stances, and even though it was just a preseason tournament, we 
did what we needed to do to advance. ”
On Saturday, the Tritons faced off against Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation opponent UC Santa Barbara and lost in straight 
sets. UCSD stayed close in the first set (25–23) but struggled 
down the stretch, losing the last two sets 25–11 and 25–16.
“In game one, we did really well to come back, but lost 25–23, ” 
Ring said. “ After that, they just controlled the match and were 
clearly the better team on the night. But I think we learned some 
things about ourselves and will be able to go over the video and 
improve from there. ”
The Tritons will begin MPSF conference play this Friday on 
the road against USC.
When asked, Ring said he has a fairly defined idea of what 
his starting lineup will look like this season. Ring said he plans

Tritons Fall to 1–5 in 
CCAA Conference Playm EN'S  BASKETBA ll
The team fell to Cal State Stanislaus 70–64 and Chico 
State 73–50 and will end their homestand this week.
After a promising preseason 
start, the Tritons have since slipped 
to 1–5 in conference play, losing to 
Cal State Stanislaus and Chico State 
last weekend.
On Friday, the Tritons kept the 
game close with Cal State Stanislaus 
before suffering their worst loss this 
season against No. 21 nationally 
ranked Chico State.
The Wildcats ran away with the 
early lead knocking down three con -
secutive three-pointers, creating a lead 
which quickly grew to a 20-point gulf 
that the Tritons — 8-of-29 in the first 
half — could not gap.
UCSD still had trouble hitting 
shots coming out of the break, all 
the while struggling to match up 
with Chico’s bench, which contrib -
uted 20 points.
“To some degree, [missing easy 
shots] can become contagious, ” first 
year head coach Eric Olen said to 
the UCSD Athletics Department. 
UCSD veteran point guard James 
McCann was the only Triton to record 
double figures against the Wildcats, 
with 15 points in 34 minutes.
McCann had another big game 
Friday against Cal State Stanislaus, 
tallying 19 points and five assists, in a game where the Tritons had to 
battle from behind for the majority 
of the match. By the end of the first 
half, UCSD found themselves down 
35–25, falling victim to Stanislaus’ 
sharpshooters, who went 7-of-13 
from behind the arc.
“We dug ourselves into a little 
bit of a hole, and we were fight -
ing the whole time to get ours                                
elves back into the game, ” Olen said. 
“We went on a run in the beginning 
of the second half and continued 
to fight. We gave ourselves a few 
opportunities, but ultimately we just 
came up a few plays short. ” 
Despite the loss, Friday’s match 
proved to be more of an ensemble 
performance than the Tritons’ game 
against Chico. Four players recorded 
points in double digits: freshman guard 
Adam Klie, sophomore guard Hunter 
Walker, senior guard MacKenzie 
McCullough and McCann.
This weekend, the Tritons will close 
out their five-game homestand with 
a Friday game against Cal State East 
Bay and Cal State Monterey Bay. Both 
with 2–4 records, the two Northern 
California squads should prove to be a 
good match for the Tritons.By  RACHE l UDA   SPORTS EDITORPHOTO  BY BEATRIZ BAJUELOS /GUARDIAN FILE
