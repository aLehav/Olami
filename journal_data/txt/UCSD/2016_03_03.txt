UC  Davis, in a joint study with the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, revealed that last 
year’s Aliso Canyon gas leak was the 
largest methane blowout in United 
States history. Their findings were 
published in the Feb. 25 edition of 
the research journal “Science. ”
Stephen Conley, co-lead scientist 
from UC Davis, flew his aircraft 
over the Aliso Canyon area after 
the leak was sealed on Feb. 11 and 
described to the UCSD Guardian the 
readings he found as being a cause 
for concern. Not only is the methane 
release the largest leakage recorded, 
but it also has implications that 
extend beyond California’s borders.
“[The methane readings were] from two to 60 parts per million, ” 
Conley stated. “[This is] about 20 
times the next largest leak we’ve 
seen. The escaped gas is now 
continuing its journey around 
the world. Beyond the short-term 
potential health issues, this isn’t an 
Los Angeles or California problem 
— it’s a global issue. ”
According to Thomas Ryerson, 
the co-lead scientist from the NOAA, 
the accidental leakage that took 
place last October has had adverse 
consequences, affecting both people 
and the environment.
“This leak displaced thousands 
of people, causing acute health 
problems,” Ryerson told the 
Guardian. “It released 97,100 
metric tons of methane, a powerful 
greenhouse gas into the atmosphere 
… [affecting] climate, air quality and human health. ”
Ryerson spoke about the state’s 
efforts to reduce the impact of 
automobiles on climate change. 
These measures involve enhancing 
the standard fuel economy and 
endorsing the use of greener 
transportation practices.
“Significant effort and expense 
has been spent in California over 
the years to minimize greenhouse 
gas emissions,” Ryerson said. 
“[These include] improving fleet 
gas mileage, promoting hybrid and 
electric vehicles [and] supporting 
alternative and public transport. ”
In spite of these efforts, the 
methane leak, before its containment 
on Feb. 11, produced a volume of 
greenhouse gas comparable to the University’s 
Mental Health 
Services Gets 
C+ GradeUCSD
The UC Student Association 
based their evaluations on 
accessibility, staff diversity 
and student outreach.

CONTRIBUTING WRITER
UCSD received a C+ grade in 
the UC Student Association’s mental 
health services evaluation on Feb. 
9. UCSA conducted the study as 
part of the #HowAreY ou campaign, 
which aims to draw attention to 
the University of California’s failure 
to provide adequate services for 
students in need of mental help. 
A.S. Vice President of External 
Affairs Krystl Fabella, who is also 
a member of UCSA ’s Board of 
Directors, described to the UCSD 
Guardian how UCSD’s score 
reflects how the university does not 
prioritize student mental health, 
even when an increasing number of 
students require assistance. Evidence 
of this can be seen with the student-
to-counselor ratio being 1550:1.
“It is a testament to really how 
under-resourced, understaffed, 
underfunded our CAPS services 
are, ” Fabella said. “While the fact that 
more students are utilizing CAPS 
for counseling shows that mental 
illness is becoming less stigmatized 
and students are encouraged to get 
help, we don’t have the capacity to 
meet these needs. ”
Fabella also thinks that the four-
week waiting period for students 
to receive a CAPS appointment 
is another example of how UCSD 
needs to prioritize counseling.
“It is absolutely appalling, ” Fabella 
commented. “Help for mental health 
crises should be immediate, just as 
physical illnesses are treated with 
urgency. As we know, they don’t 
happen in long durations of weeks, 
but are often unanticipated and are 
due to present factors. ”
Between September 2015 and 
February 2016, UCSA sent student 
researchers to meet with CAPS 
directors and staff who were asked 
to answer 17 questions focused 
on three core areas: accessibility, 
diversity of staff and amount of 
student outreach by on-campus 
mental health centers. The responses 
were compiled into a final score for 
each campus on a scale of A to F; 
the average score across the UC 
campuses was a C.
CAPS Director Reina Juarez 
explained to the Guardian how 
CAPS is working to address the 
accessibility area that UCSA’s 
evaluation called for.
“[Accessibility] is an issue that 
we have been working diligently to 
address, ” Juarez said. “The student UC Berkeley Officials Reveal 
Servers Were Attacked
UC Berkeley’s financial system, which stores the 
bank account and social security numbers of students, 
faculty and vendors, was breached on Dec. 28, 2015. The 
university began notifying victims of the cyberattack 
last Friday. Over 80,000 current and former students, 
employees and vendors may have have been affected by 
the attack.
Senior Director of Strategic Communications at 
UC Berkeley Janet Gilmore told the UCSD Guardian 
officials needed time to identify the individuals affected 
before they could notify the victims.
“With any cyberattack, it takes time to determine the 
scope of the attack, restore the integrity of the system 
[and] identify the individuals potentially affected, ” 
Gilmore explained. “Once the university discovered 
the attack, it promptly hired an outside computer 
investigation firm to ensure the process could move 
along as quickly as possible and to help confirm that the 
attack was fully contained and the intruders expelled 
from the system. ”
According to Gilmore, the attack took place while campus officials were in the process of patching a 
security flaw in the financial system. The campus’s 
existing security measures stopped the intrusion within 
24 hours of its discovery. 
Gilmore also clarified that there is no evidence that 
the sensitive information was accessed or used, but UC 
Berkeley is offering students free credit-monitoring 
services as a precautionary measure.
“Out of an abundance of caution, we are offering those 
potentially impacted with a year of credit monitoring, 
free of charge, and a package of related credit protection 
services, again, free of charge, ” Gilmore said. “Tips and 
resource information are also being provided. ”
Following the breach, campus officials hired security 
experts to improve their security measures and are 
working to expedite the process of fixing defects in 
administrative systems during updates.
This attack follows another breach in UC Berkeley’s 
cybersecurity system that occurred in September 
2014, which compromised the information used by 
its Real Estate Division.  According to Gilmore, large B y   promit a  nandy      MEN’S BASKETBALL

Naftali Burakovsky, Lisa Chik, Oliver Cromwell, Christian Duarte, 
Josh Lefler, Maria Sebas, Sam Velazquez, Nathan WalkerPresident Obama’s senior 
science and technology advisor 
John Holdren delivered the annual 
Herb York Memorial Lecture this 
past Monday at UCSD’s Sanford 
Consortium on how science and 
engineering policy has developed 
under the Obama administration. 
UCSD hosted the lecture in honor 
of Herbert York — the university’s 
first chancellor, an advisor to five 
different presidents and the founder 
of the Institute of Global Conflict 
and Cooperation. The IGCC aims 
to unite social science and lab 
science disciplines to work together 
on pressing issues such as nuclear 
proliferation, national security and 
climate change.
Holdren’s lecture will mark the 
fifth in this series, which celebrates 
his philosophy of nonproliferation 
and international cooperation. His talk, titled “Science and Engineering 
for the Public Good: Priorities, 
Policies and Partnerships in the 
Obama Administration,” was an 
overview of science and engineering 
in public policy. 
He explained the current state of 
science and technology policy, those 
areas the national administration 
is working to influence through 
its many programs and goals for 
the future. Holdren especially 
highlighted the  level of engagement 
which the current administration 
aims to have within the wider 
science and technology community.
“[President Obama] does more 
meet and greets [in the Oval Office] 
for scientists, engineers and science 
teachers than he does for sports 
teams, ” Holdren told the audience. 
“[Obama] was the first president to 
say, ‘If I’m going to meet the Super 
Bowl champions, I’m also going to 
meet the young science champions. ’”
Holdren touched on an array of topics, including the economy, 
public health, the environment, 
national and homeland security, 
international relations and STEM 
education programs. He also 
emphasized the importance of social 
science research as a way to gain 
more insight into how the results 
of scientific advancement actually 
function in society.
“Inexplicably, [we are] having 
trouble with some members 
of Congress who don’t think 
basic research is something the 
federal government should be 
investing in, ” Holdren said. “They 
particularly seem to hate research 
in social science [and are] blind 
to the enormous advances in our 
understanding the effectiveness 
of our institutions that have come 
from research in social science. ”
Among the audience members 
was Gary Cottrel, Director of UCSD’s 
Science of Learning Center and a 
professor from the Jacobs School of Engineering. He commented on the 
low levels of reading improvement 
among American students. 
“There’s been a flatline in reading 
improvement over the past 10, 20 
years, ” Cottrel said. “So, how are we 
going to improve learning for our 
students?”
Holdren’s reply was that STEM 
is part of a greater initiative to 
improve U.S. education.
“Reading improvement is 
important and is not explicitly a 
part of our STEM ed initiative, 
and STEM ed is certainly not the 
whole ballgame, ” Holdren replied. 
“I’m certainly prepared to believe 
that reading needs so much 
improvement because writing needs 
so much improvement. I’ d love to 
see us do more in that domain. ”CAMPUS

Ryerson: Methane Leak Offset Progress Made Over Previous Years to Reduce Emissions
amount of methane released from 
527,000 cars in the U.S. annually.
Ryerson clarified that the impact 
of the gas leak not only neutralizes 
Californian efforts exerted to 
combat climate change, but also sets 
the initiative back even further.
“It will take even more effort to 
compensate for the effects of this 
leak and ensure that we are better prepared for any future accidental 
releases, ” Ryerson said.
Conley’s data collection methods 
are a major takeaway from this 
experience, according to co-author 
Donald Blake. The availability of 
an aircraft to capture measurements 
is invaluable in keeping track of 
changes in the atmosphere, especially 
damaging ones.
“It was important to have 
Steve’s plane fly around the area so estimates of leak rate could be 
made, ” Blake told the Guardian. “I 
think having this type of aircraft 
sampling is important, and I would 
like us to have such capability on 
standby in the event something else 
happens like this. ”
Conley believes that the next step 
people need to take in order to 
reduce climate change is to decrease 
the use of fossil fuels; unless that 
measure is taken, methane gas will continue to pose a threat.
“Hopefully, [people will] get a 
little more serious about moving 
away from fossil fuels, ” Conley said. 
“We need to accept that as long as we 
have natural gas heated homes, we’ll 
need to store and transport methane, 
and we’ll continue to have leaks. ”▶ METHANE,  from page 1

18172_10x8 OL.indd   1 12/14/2015   3:13:40 PMUCLA Health Was Also Subject to a Cyber Attack in Last Year
organizations are often victims of 
cyberattacks, and UC Berkeley is 
not the first school in the University 
of California to be affected by an 
attack.  UCLA Health, for example, 
was hacked in July 2015. UCSD 
Director of IT Services Brian 
DeMeulle explained that UCSD, 
like all organizations, may also be 
a target for hackers, but campus 
officials are constantly watching out 
for and stopping potential threats.
“We have numerous processes 
and tools in place to monitor, analyze and block bad actors from 
gaining access to our information 
assets, ” DeMeulle told the Guardian. 
“With that, we are constantly 
looking for ways to improve our 
security and risk posture, balancing 
that with the needs of the business. ”
In addition to each campus’ 
individual security protocols, the 
UC system also has systemwide 
security measures in place to 
monitor information. DeMeulle 
explained, however, that the best 
way for a person to protect their 
information is to carefully monitor 
their own online activity.
“Security is everyone’s responsibility,” DeMeulle said. 
“This is as much a cultural and 
behavioral concern as is it a 
technological one. The more users 
are educated regarding appropriate 
behavior while utilizing computing 
resources and working with digital 
information, including both work-
related information and their 
own personal information, the 
better we can work collaboratively 
toward proactively identifying and 
mitigating potential security issues. ”
Student Services Fee Increase Will Help Pay for New CAPS Staff
services fee increased by 5 percent 
for 2015–2016 and is scheduled to 
continue increasing by 5 percent 
annually for the next five years. Half 
of these funds have been earmarked 
for the hiring of additional mental 
health staff on the campuses. ” 
Juarez added that CAPS is 
currently working on addressing 
the staffing issue that #HowAreYou 
mandated the university to fix. 
“Hiring of these positions — 
psychologists, psychiatrists and licensed clinical social workers and 
case managers — has already begun, 
and our recruitment is focused on 
fulfilling the diversity needs of each 
campus, ” Juarez said. 
Fabella argued that the importance 
of providing available and quality 
mental health services is crucial for 
UCSD because of the stress that 
academics bring to students.
“UCSD is an academically 
rigorous and focused school where 
the social culture is overpowered 
by academically competitive 
nature, ” Fabella said. “We have an academic culture where students 
are programmed to make their 
coursework the number one priority, 
but forego a lot of important parts 
about human nature, like self care ... 
socializing, connecting, prioritizing 
a support system, activities and so 
on. Obviously, school should be 
the number one priority, but we’ve 
appropriated it at the cost of mental 
wellbeing. ”▶ HEALTH,  from page 1▶ CYBER,  from page 1Looking for the

the  Long  Line
                   to  get  HELp
In late December, the UC 
Berkeley Financial System was 
breached and the personal 
information of approximately 80,000 
students, faculty staff and vendors 
was accessed. This is not a shock 
in today’s age of cyber insecurity. 
However, what’s surprising is that 
UC Berkeley officials abstained from 
notifying victims of the attack until 
just last Friday, meaning that two 
whole months passed in which the 
students’ finances could have been 
used without their knowledge. This 
is a chilling possibility.
And according to SF Gate, 
officials claim there is no evidence 
that the parties responsible for the 
attack copied any of the information. 
This may sound reassuring, but it’s 
equivalent to a child asserting that 
there is no evidence she dropped 
your toothbrush in the toilet, despite 
it dripping and you definitely 
hearing a splash. Y ou can’t prove it, 
but the danger is pretty clear.
The university is now urging 
victims through email to keep an 
eye on their bank accounts while 
offering a credit protection service 
free of charge. But, as mentioned 
earlier, it could be too late. So what 
compelled the administration to 
withhold this information and leave 
its constituents at risk?
Some argue that leaking to 
the public the fact that they were 
breached could put their system at even greater risk than not doing so. 
If, for example, a patch was left 
open on the system, letting everyone 
know right away before it was closed 
could have potentially presented an 
opportunity for other cyber attackers 
to exploit the system while it was 
vulnerable. Similar to a disease 
outbreak, the public knowing too 
little information could be more 
beneficial than knowing too much 
of it. Senior Director of Strategic 
Communications Janet Gilmore 
spoke to this point in an interview 
with the UCSD Guardian.
“With any cyber attack, it takes 
time to determine the scope of 
the attack, restore the integrity 
of the system [and] identify the 
individuals potentially affected, ” 
Gilmore explained. “Once the 
university discovered the attack, 
it promptly hired an outside 
computer investigation firm to 
ensure the process could move 
along as quickly as possible and to 
help confirm that the attack was 
fully contained and the intruders 
expelled from the system. ”
However, according to Mercury 
News, the intrusion was detected 
within 24 hours of it happening 
and the system was patched in early 
January, just a week or two later. That 
still leaves approximately a month 
and a half in which the victims could 
begin the process of tracking their 
accounts and protecting their credit but didn’t know they had a significant 
reason to.
Regardless, maybe we shouldn’t 
be shocked, as this isn’t the first 
time a cyber attack at the university 
went unannounced for a perplexing 
amount of time. Just last September, 
the campus’ server was breached, 
yet the public wasn’t notified until 
December. UC Berkeley’s system 
gets compromised as often as the 
students’ trust in its administration 
does — or at least what’s left of it.
We provide officials with 
all of our private and valuable 
information, confident that they’ll 
protect it from theft and third-
party use, but their system fails and 
we have to merely accept that this 
is the era of technology that we live 
in. But then, when our information 
is accessed and potentially stolen, 
we, the sole owners of it, are 
not made aware of the new risk 
presented to our life until weeks or 
even months later.
With such a troubling situation 
happening twice in a mere six 
months, members of the UC 
community are growing tired of and 
possibly apathetic toward the lack 
of protection and communication 
from the administration. It is time 
that the university prioritizes this 
issue by allocating resources toward 
guarding our private information 
and promptly admitting when it fails 
to do so.No Transparency in Administrative Delay to Inform Students of  Cyber Attack

The UCSD Guardian is published twice a week at the 
University of California at San Diego. Contents © 
2015. Views expressed herein represent the majority 
vote of the editorial board and are not necessarily those 
of the UC Board of Regents, the ASUCSD or the 
members of the Guardian staff. High expectations, financial pressures and an overload of work give 
college students record-high amounts of stress. However, colleges can’t — or 
won’t — fund resources to handle the influx of suffering students. UCSD was 
given a C+ for Mental Health services by the University of California Student 
Association. Unlike classes where you do some extra credit assignments or 
pull a Hail Mary on the final, in order to improve this grade and better serve 
the UCSD community we need to seriously look at effectively treating mental 
health issue.
According to the American Psychological Association, 41.6 percent 
of polled college students reported feeling symptoms of anxiety and 36.4 
percent reported symptoms of depression. However, the same survey found 
that at a large university such as UCSD, only 6 to 7 percent of students seek 
professional help. This might have something to do with the fact that the ratio 
of full-time Counseling and Psychological Services faculty to students is a 
staggering 1:1550. In the UCSA Mental Health Evaluations, UCSD scored 
the worst on the accessibility category with 13 out of 20 possible points. 
UCSA defined the judgement criteria for accessibility as “the ability to receive 
prompt care in a safe and comfortable environment. ” UCSD failed the prompt 
part of that test.
It can take between three and four weeks to get an appointment with 
CAPS. It is discouraging at best and dangerous at worst for suffering, anxious 
students to be turned away or made to wait three weeks. This is unacceptable, 
both for students’ stress going ignored and for the stress on the overburdened CAPS staff. For most issues deemed long-term, CAPS will refer students to 
other providers for treatment and medication, but “short-term” issues such as 
school related anxiety are directly treated at CAPS. However, most problems 
have to go through CAPS for any treatment at all. Referring students to 
off-campus providers increases the time it takes to get treatment, but it is 
necessary for CAPS to function. For students who need medication, UCSD 
has only one full-time psychiatrist, and one part-time, according the CAPS 
website. It seems that CAPS doesn’t have the funding for any more.  No 
matter the quality of CAPS staff members, they cannot handle the combined 
woes of 30,000 students. 
For a frugal solution, CAPS should increase the amount of Student 
Health Advocates: peers who work with SHS to educate students on issues 
and services specific to mental health. Having more peer educators is a 
cheap way to spread outreach and make care more accessible while working 
to extinguish the stigma around depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress 
disorder and other disorders. 
In addition to Student Health Advocates, implementing a peer listening 
program could provide temporary relief to struggling students. A school-
sponsored program could model itself after 7 Cups of Tea, a website which 
connects people who are struggling with depression or relationship problems 
to trained listeners. This gives people a chance to talk through problems 
without waiting to schedule an appointment. A UCSD-specific program like 
this would be invaluable for treating the mental health crisis with relatively

MTHUILLI@UCSD.EDuAROUND THE GLOBE
Two letters seem to represent 
everything that is right or wrong 
with our generation. P for political, 
and C for correctness. For many, the 
millennials and Generation Z are 
an over-protected bunch of school 
brats who use the words “racism” 
and “sexism” as ways to barricade 
themselves away from any real-life 
threats. But really, PC culture is a 
necessity in today’s world in order 
to reduce the impact of violent and 
offensive speeches and to oppose 
extremist ideologies. 
According to the Hill, even 
President Barack Obama expressed 
himself on the topic, criticizing 
the grounds on which PC culture 
was established. He criticized 
college campuses that avoid 
reading books with any hint of 
a demeaning attitude towards 
women. Author Bret Easton Ellis 
shares this opinion that millennials 
are defined by “oversensitivity” and 
“overreacting. ” Both of them make 
a pertinent point, but although PC 
culture may sugarcoat some ideas, 
it mostly brings a positive impact 
to our society.
Something that these critics 
fail to take into account, especially 
in today’s strongly opinionated 
political landscape, is the red carpet 
deployed for personalities like 
Donald Trump and Ben Carson 
to spill their right-wing extremist 
views on Muslims and immigration, 
among other topics. It is hard to 
blame college students for willfully 
shielding themselves from atrocious 
declarations like the ones from 
Trump, when their own left-wing 
ideas are still labeled socialist or 
communist, and quickly dismissed. 
This is more a result of political 
polarization in the United States 
than it is of the new generation 
being soft and unaccepting. 
To the dismay of Vanity Fair’s 
London Editor Henry Porter, PC 
culture has reportedly reached 
Britain. Porter says that millennials 
often expand upon personal rights 
and “various classes of victimhood” 
without a lot of reflection upon 
the subject of liberty. Again, his 
comments only critique a small 
part of what PC culture is really 
about. Michelle Duguid, a professor 
of organizational behavior at 
Washington University in St. Louis, 
co-authored a study that claims 
establishing a PC environment 
makes it more comfortable for both 
men and women to share their 
perspectives even within a diverse 
group of people. Her findings 
highlight the crucial shift in social 
norms that eventually nurtured PC 
culture. In 2016, we are trying to 
bring about change that is meant to 
challenge us individually but also 
protect historically secluded social 
groups from people like Carson, 
who wrongly and offensively 
claimed in a CNN interview that 
some heterosexual people who enter 
prison are turned homosexual.
While people should have a right 
to express their views, they must 
also consider how their words and 
actions affect others. PC culture is 
an adapted response to an age where 
certain types of virtual and human 
interactions are ten-fold the amount 
of ones our parents were exposed to. 
In an age of changing social norms, 
bigoted hate speech that clearly aims 
to harm any group or individual 
should not be protected under the 
guise of liberty. Why PC

such as the one above, but a safe, 
confidential space that caters to 
the unique needs of the UCSD 
community would especially help 
struggling students.  
A.S. Office of Student Advocacy 
offers another model that 
demonstrates how we could maintain 
confidentiality while effectively 
helping those in need. Other schools, 
such as University of Minnesota 
and dozens of high schools around 
the country, are training peers to 
help their friends. This also offers 
training and experience to those who 
are interested in working in mental 
health fields. Although they cannot 
give advice or referrals, peer listeners can help student through hard times 
when CAPS is not available. 
Having more educated students 
could also help to eliminate the 
stigma surround “crazy” people. 
Although UCSD scored well on 
the outreach category, the stigma 
around mental health still remains. 
This is even more pertinent at 
UCSD because half of all UCSD 
students identify as Asian-
American, a community which 
is disproportionately affected by 
mental health issues. The “model 
minority” myth helps hide the fact 
that, according to APA, suicide 
was the second-leading cause of 
death for Asian-Americans aged 
15 to 34. In addition, according 
to research by Stanley Sue of UC 
Davis, Asian-American students are less likely to seek help than 
other racial groups. This tendency 
has many causes, such as family 
and academic pressure, but no 
matter the cause, this intersectional 
issue is largely ignored in outreach 
initiatives. Starting initiatives that 
target these specific problems could 
cater to issues specific to the UCSD 
community. 
Of course, all the potential 
programs mentioned above require 
staff, resources and — more 
importantly — money. CAPS, which 
is free to all students, cannot operate 
effectively with the current level of 
funding. The Guardian Editorial 
Board joins the UCSA in urging the 
UC system to prioritize the mental 
health of the students, not just with 
words but with their wallets. ▶ MENTAL HEALTH from page 4GOT ISSUES?

THE GUARDIAN 
CHOICE  AWARDS
If the Oscars didn’t do it for you, the Guardian will. The Academy may have already handed out the 
award for best picture, but they’ll never have the honesty to pass out these prizes.

You’ve entered a world where pain and pleasure are the only 
paths. Y our mindset is the only barrier capable of keeping you 
from feeling, from exploring the true depths of this curious land. 
The lights dim, a deep breath is taken and beads of sweat follow 
every crevice. The physical and mental are soon indistinguishable 
from each other, building to a moment where the taut muscles and 
gyrating hips of Channing Tatum change from optional to necessary. That’s 
the moment when you realize sexuality is on a spectrum and you’re heading 
wherever the well-defined meat is — a stripper convention at Myrtle Beach.
—  sam  velazquez   A&E Editorial Assistant
While every beanie-sporting art major and bespectacled professor has been 
passionately debating which film ought to be deemed the “best, ” an equally 
important discussion has been ignored. It seems that all of Hollywood and all of 
the Oscars’ film viewership has turned a blind eye to the conversation of which 
movie can truly be called the “coldest. ” This year, both Quentin Tarantino’s “The 
Hateful Eight” and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu’s lauded “The Revenant” make 
great attempts at frostiness. Ultimately, “The Hateful Eight” sells its soul by 
featuring too many indoor scenes and merely chills, while “The Revenant” numbs.

High-speed imports and over-the-top combat — what could be more Asian? 
On top of that, Sung Kang, who plays Han Seoul-Oh, had what is believed to 
be the American record for on-screen time for an Asian: a whopping two seconds. 
The fact that it was a death scene renders his appearance even more powerful, 
symbolizing the transcendence of Asians in American cinema. At this rate, every 
film will star a dying Asian by the year 2020 — also the year China invades the U.S. 
for James Franco’s new film about murdering the Chinese president.

The label “foreign film” is oftentimes so constricting — so limiting to the available 
pool of competition. Imagine, it has the nerve to suggest that only films outside 
of the continental United States are eligible. So even places like Timbuktu, North 
Korea and Antarctica are up for contention. However, Ridley Scott’s latest endeavor 
is a foreign film if there ever was such a thing. What’s more foreign than Mars, for 
goodness’ sake? It’s not even on Earth, and even the parts that take place on our 
planet have characters named Mindy Park (Mackenzie Davis) and Vincent Kapoor 
(Chiwetel Ejiofor). Now that’s foreign! Props for that casting. 
—  Tynan  y anaga  Senior Staff WriterIf you are like most people, you didn’t notice the limited release of “Star 
Wars: The Force Awakens” last December. The film, however, with its unique 
characters and exhilarating story, is an instant indie sci-fi classic. Directed by 
arthouse filmmaker Jeffrey Jacob Abrams, “Star Wars” tells the story of the 
friendship between a financially insecure woman and a young black veteran 
disillusioned by his government. The film is also full of stunning sci-fi 
spectacle, making great use of lifelike animatronics and puppets despite 
the film’s small budget. While the film was largely ignored and never went 
on to break box office records, “Star Wars” is an extraordinary work of 
independent filmmaking that deserved to be a blockbuster.

Scorsese, Inarritu, Native Americans — these are all people whom Leonardo DiCaprio 
thanked in his Oscars speech. Y et he failed to mention the incredible, reserved work 
of his on-screen co-star Jimmy “the dead horse” Cooper. Any horse can stay and neigh. 
But Jimmy, he didn’t settle; he didn’t keep it mane-stream. No, he buckled down and 
ponied up, delivering a performance so raw, so meaty that you’ll feel behooved to shift 
your focus away from Leo and onto this glorious domestic creature. Although Jason 
Seagull represented his animal brethren well, while sporting the hippiest of do-rags, the 
“How I Met Your Mother” star won’t be beating a dead horse this time.

Honorable Mentions: “Everest, ” “The Hateful Eight”
Honorable Mentions: “Brooklyn, ” “Black Mass” “Irish need not apply. ” These were the simple words that the illiterate Irish 
and their many ilk were incapable of reading only a century ago. They’ve 
come a long way since then, learning how to read at the third-grade level and 
now becoming the wardens of the prisons they were once housed in and built. 
“Spotlight” goes even further to hammer in their moral ascent from depravity, 
even in a city as backward as Boston. The film pulls at the heartstrings by proving 
that the education system isn’t broken, showcasing a gang of semi-literate Irish 
helping each other read and write. Go, Celtics!

OK, so maybe he still is a bit of a “scruffy-looking 
nerf herder” even after 30 years, but Harrison 
Ford deserves some love to go with his ample “Force 
Awakens” payday. After all, even with the extra snow 
on the roof, he can still outrun rathtars like an ever-adept 
Indiana Jones. Although based on his on-set injuries and 
advanced years — 73 to be exact — it’s probably better for 
everyone that he was (SPOILERS!) killed off before he actually 
kicks the bucket for real. But seriously, you’ve got to love him, 
because they just don’t make Solos like they used to. They’re

Suits, martinis, hot women and a colorful megalomaniac; all 
the stereotypical elements of a Bond film are incorporated in 
“Kingsman: The Secret Service. ” All except Bond, which makes it 
great. Playing off Bond’s gentleman spy character and ridiculous 
gadgetry, the world of Kingsman is full of bulletproof umbrellas 
and suits (which are honestly a better explanations for why Bond 
never gets more than a scrape along his chiseled jaw) and shoes 
with poisoned knives. Any spy film that has the beautiful princess 
offering anal to the protagonist isn’t a film that takes itself too 
seriously. Kingsman represents the end of the traditional Bond 
villain’s weapon of choice — death by boredom.

thanks to an incredible range that spans gruff unintelligible 
American (“Warrior”) to gruff unintelligible English behind a mask 
(“The Dark Knight Rises”) to gruff unintelligible colonial American 
(“The Revenant”). 
He transcends his mastery of muttering in “Mad Max, ” delivering

FAVORITE FILMS:8     THE UCSD GUARDIAN | THURSDAY , MARCH 3, 2016 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  
The match. A simple phrase 
that can refer to any number 
of relationships and circumstances. 
One idea that Anna Ziegler mines, 
revealing most, if not all, of what 
that very phrase could mean during 
one tennis match: one setting, two 
polarizing worlds that overlap to 
form the perfect match. Tim Porter 
(Patrick Adams, “Suits”) and Sergei 
Sergeyev (Alex Mickiewicz, “Therese 
Raquin”) are both pretty good at 
playing tennis, to say the least, and 
want to win the U.S. Open; that’s 
about as much as they have in 
common. Resentment, privilege and 
culture are seamlessly woven into a 
cohesive set of internal battles which 
bounce off the court and into a series 
of internal dialogues. Every point 
won and every point lost is coupled 
with a memory or insecurity which 
enjoins the players to act accordingly. 
Furthermore, the lights and sound effects make you see props where 
there are none, intensifying the match 
by transforming a tennis court into an 
intimate arena. 
Tim is an aging pro who is 
insecure about the possibility of 
losing his lifelong status as America’s 
golden boy. Converting a hobby 
into a profession was never really 
a question for Tim; the option was 
handed to him on a shiny new tennis 
racket, having grown up with both 
parents and ample financial support. 
Contrast this to Sergei, who had to 
leave his family and life in a rural 
Russian village so that he might forge 
an opportunity for himself through 
something he was good at. As his 
fiancee, Gallina (Natalia Payne, “Me, 
Myself and I”), points out, thinking 
“is not [Sergei’s] strength. ” Sergei 
and Tim are blatantly in each other’s 
heads, sizing each other up with 
every toss of an invisible ball. Sergei capitalizes on Tim’s dependence 
on the crowd and celebrity status 
by seizing every opportunity Tim 
appears to falter and calling it out as 
the weakness it ultimately is — after 
all, they “don’t want to watch man 
get slaughtered so they check their 
phones. ” Tim, in turn, sees through 
Sergei’s aggressive play and exposes it 
for the insecurity that it is. The cycle 
continues until match point. 
Their performance on the court 
is reflected through their personal 
relationships. Tim’s relationship 
with Mallory (Troian Bellisario, 
“Pretty Little Liars”) is something we 
typically see in overly sentimental 
stories that attempt to portray 
love: she is his best friend, devoted 
wife, mother of his son and, not 
surprisingly, the partner who could 
not crack the top-10 rankings in 
the tennis world. While Mallory’s 
relationship with Tim itself is cheesy, 
the actors are flawless in transmitting 
their tumultuous emotions as they 
endure a series of miscarriages. Especially poignant is the moment 
the Tim abandons his charm and 
screams at Mallory when she accuses 
him of being too much into the 
game to share in her pain. Sergei and 
Gallina, however, became who they 
were because of their hardships and, 
as such, are focused on becoming 
tougher individuals, channeling 
their affection into phrases of 
encouragement such as “Go be brave 
in ways Mom could not” — advice 
from Gallina prior to the match. 
Gallina, like Mallory, is also the less 
successful partner; her hopes of 
becoming an actress diminished, she 
chooses to live vicariously through 
Sergei’s career. Again, the actors 
are on point in terms of portraying 
their relationship. We cannot deny, 
however, that Sergei and Gallina’s 
relationship is the more complex of 
the two and their respective lines 
illustrate this. 
While the internal battles and 
dialogues are profound, forcing us to 
confront our own internal conflicts and empathize with the characters, 
it is important to recognize that 
the writers do take advantage of 
stereotypes. Tim is, after all, a 
seemingly typical white, American, 
upper-middle class boy while Sergei 
fits perfectly into the uneducated, 
explosive Russian playboy who has 
had to fight his way to the top. Their 
partners also show the two sides 
of the female spectrum: the crazy, 
chatty fiancee versus the unsatisfied 
but supportive wife. Nonetheless, 
the stereotypes are a perfect match 
and are tempered, to an extent, by 
organic movements and dialogue.
Overall, “The Last Match” is 
a worthwhile experience, and 
resentment, privilege and culture 
are seamlessly woven into a 
cohesive set of internal battles 
which bounce off the court, giving 
us a snapshot of our own lives.

The  last  ma tch
Sponsored and supported by Qualcomm Foundation, 
California Arts Council, the ResMed Foundation, the 
Museum of Contemporary Art’s Education Programs 
and the Cynthia and George Mitchell Foundation, 
to name a few, A New Standard is an exhibition 
that showcases thought-provoking art through a 
rare, exciting collaboration between the Museum of 
Contemporary Art San Diego and UCSD. Held at the 
MCASD in its very own Coast Room, the event offers 
not only its main program of student works, but also a 
breathtaking ocean view and overlooks the museum’s 
scenic seaside Sculpture Garden — perhaps creating 
more of an incentive to go. Along with free music, 
snacks and drinks, interested attendants will have the 
opportunity to witness and ponder works produced 
by seven UCSD students, whose art projects serve as 
a response to the exhibition “Ed Ruscha Then & Now: 
Paintings from the 1960s and 2000s. ”
A New Standard takes on concepts of culture and 
identity, seeking to explore both their alternative and 
hybrid dimensions. At the exhibition, keen visitors will 
find themselves looking at different pieces of art from 
student-created projects — by Farshid Bazmandegan, 
Tori Estrada-Odama, Shuqi Huang and Emily Zheng 
— to curated works — by Neda Kerendian, Diana 
Benavidez, Thomas McGovern and Juan Delgado — all 
of which reflect a palette of profound experiences and 
realities. It is the exhibition’s hope that these subjective 
art forms, unique to their respective creators, bring forth 
a form of dialogue or rhetoric that challenges the notion 
of the norm. That being said, the surface has only been 
scratched. The authenticity of an experience rests on 
one’s willingness to not only be at the event physically, 
but also mentally, where a sense of awe is strongly 
recommended.  
     March is not only distinguished by the resurrection of 
Shamrock Shakes and deceptively hollow chocolate 
bunnies, but is the page on your calendar graced by 
Women’s History Month. Riding on the current number-
one small-talk topic of presidential elections (Super 
Tuesday, anyone?), the theme this year is “Working to 
Form a More Perfect Union: Honoring Women in Public 
Service and Government. ” But regardless of theme, the 
month is an opportunity to highlight female triumph, 
success and creation in all dimensions of life — including 
that within the realm of art. 
In concert with Women’s History Month, La 
Bodega Gallery is presenting VENUS on March 5, with 
opening night from 5 to 10 p.m., and will continue 
until March 16. The art exhibit will be an all-female 
event, highlighting the talent and achievements of 
artists not only from California, but throughout the 
nation and world. The exhibit collection is composed 
of artwork from an extensive number of individuals 
including Thao Huynh, BreAnne Custodio, Paulette Jo, 
Junk & PO and Coco Miller. The art media vary just as 
much as the individuals participating: oil, watercolor, 
bronze, photography, etc. The event will also feature 
performance art by Fusion Creation’s Lidia Ochoa of live 
body painting.
Even the music at the event will be by emerging 
female musicians. There will be live performances by 
Gabriela & La Buena Onda along with vocalist and 
DJs Queendom Tribe Music. All ages are welcome and 
admission is free, so do schedule a weekend or a study 
break of spring break to spend some time admiring some 
art with your favorite women. 
 With spring hitting this side of the coast a little 
faster than most, here’s an opportunity to officially 
commemorate the start of the new season. While everyone 
else dons winter North Face fleeces and long johns, break 
out those silk kimonos, breezy yukatas and open-toe zori 
for a transcendental experience at the 11th Annual Cherry 
Blossom Festival hosted in the Japanese Friendship Gardens 
near the outskirts of Balboa Park this upcoming Saturday 
and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Scheduled activities 
vary per day, so make sure to check the website for further 
information, but regardless of which day one attends, the 
festival is sure to please. 
This Japanese Cherry Blossom festival, not to be confused 
with a Bath and Body Works semi-annual sale, combines the 
best of Balboa’s communal climate with Japanese culture to 
curate a San Diegan favorite for all ages. It boasts traditional 
taiko performances and Ondo dancers from Japanese 
schools around the San Diego area, hanami picnics and tea 
ceremonies located in the Upper Exhibit Hall, and a Balboa 
Park tradition that honors the history and practice of tea 
ceremonies, as well as a beer and sake garden for those who 
can legally imbibe while celebrating this spring season.
 And as if the folks at the Japanese Friendship Gardens 
know finals week is right around the corner, this festival also 
partners with the Foundation for Wellness Professionals to 
offer free massages and health screenings. So for as little as 
five dollars, not only do you get a free health update without 
dealing with SHIP , but complementary Teavana samples, a 
cup of Lupicia tea, a bag of Japanese desserts and chance to 
immerse into traditional and modern Japanese culture. So 
this weekend, sip, dine and dance underneath a picturesque 
cherry blossom scene, and while it’s not the same as the 
scene in Hokkaido, for five dollars, this will do.

An Advice 
Column 
How do I know what I 
stand for during this 
political season? How do 
I be informed and know which 
candidate is best for me? — 
Anonymous
An onlooker of the political 
stadium, which is slowly morphing 
into a cross between an open 
podium free-for-all — friendly fire 
not excluded — and a smorgasbord 
of GIFs, memes and quotes from 
the debate flops, may just groan 
and marinate in their self-obsessed 
apathy towards the system. How 
unoriginal. Yet, one cannot blame 
an individual for feeling this 
way; the Internet is undoubtedly 
oversaturated with impassioned 
literature founded upon life 
circumstances, such as late-night 
Twitter rants or anger at the newest 
McDonald’s opening up around 
the corner, and thus reigniting a 
callous hatred for gentrification. 
There’s nothing wrong with this 
inherent polyvocality, however 
— the Internet is an accessible, 
economical medium where 
everyone can contribute to the 
global dialogue of “whatever the 
hellhound you want. ” But for the 
sake of answering this question, 
being informed is a product of 
social and political awareness. 
Let me do you a solid: In order 
to assess your political values 
and how they fare against the 
current presidential candidates, 
you actually have to know what 
your political values are. And, 
no, mayonnaise is not a political 
value. If you’re just starting out, 
then remember the venerable 
words of the wise Professor 
Oak as once said twenty years 
ago: “Don’t go out [into the tall 
grass]! It’s unsafe!” If you are even 
hesitant to define your values, 
contending with others in the arena 
will either likely lead to getting 
roasted alive in the blogosphere or 
becoming immortalized through 
Imgur or Snapchat. I supposed 
the latter is not a terrible option 
once Ellen invites you onto her 
show — MEET THE COLLEGE 
STUDENT WITH NO OPINIONS 
— but possessing no stance is still 
effectively politically siding. Here is 
a starter kit of general and specific 
topics to assess your position: 
Foreign policy. Diplomacy. Wealth 
distribution. The perpetuation of 
racism, misogyny, heterosexism, 
classism, etc. as a way of protecting 
established forms of privilege 
and epistemology to continue the 
narrative of subjugation.
Should a candidate be apt for 
one person a la one size fits all, as 
the question phrases? Are we to 
entail the neoliberal model and 
elect candidates based on whom is 
most favorable to the individual? 
That is the antithesis of political 
advocacy: It is not about which 
candidate is best for yourself, but 
is rather willing to dedicate oneself 
to uplift everyone — even if such 
a task is impossible — rather than 
focus on the individual, inevitably 
founded on Ursula Le Guin’s

arpie shekoyan
Interview by Olga Golubkova // Lifestyle Co-Editor
Have you ever imagined yourself being a famous artist with your works hanging all over The Metropolitan or Museum of Modern 
Art? Arpie Shekoyan, a UCSD transfer student majoring in visual arts, has just gotten a step closer to this dream, as she held her 
first solo exhibition, “Disoriented, ” at Andrew D. Kamil Gallery. The UCSD Guardian talked to Shekoyan about being a visual arts 
student at UCSD and about deconstructing classic Orientalist pieces using paper, paint, glue and glitter.
I’ve been very interested in art since ever. I am a transfer student, 
so when I was in general college I was just honing my art-production 
skills. I knew that UCSD has a very good visual arts program that is largely 
conceptually based. That was exactly what I was gravitating towards, 
because although it is great to craft your skills and be a figurative and 
representational drawer, I was leaning towards conceptual thinking. I 
wanted to study what is the idea behind every art work and how each of 
them affects the masses. Because of UCSD being a research institution, 
it has a strong theoretical foundation. Some amazing artists like Allan 
Kaprow and Barbara Kruger, who created a famous feminist work “Your 
Body is a Battleground” and also a clock piece in the dining area of Price 
Center, taught at UCSD. At UCSD you can really learn from the best.GUARDIAN :Why did you decide to pursue a degree in visual arts at UCSD?
ARPIE:
What are your plans for your future work? Is “Disorientation” over?
I will definitely continue working on the series. There is still more 
research that can be done, because the issue of representation of the Orient 
is still present. I would love to keep the conversation going, as well as start 
working on new projects.  A:G:What was it like to organize your solo exhibition?
I was working on setting up the exhibit at the time when I was also 
involved in “Vagina Monologues, ” which gave me quite a rush. Each student 
has a weeklong time slot for their exhibition, so it took me two all-nighters 
to get everything situated. Installing was not easy, because there is math 
involved when you want to hang up your pieces in a traditional way. You 
have to make a lot of measurements to make sure everything is equally 
leveled. Though sometimes I had to eyeball things here and there, I was 
satisfied with how it turned out.
Many people who came to the exhibit enjoyed the way it was installed, 
which made me very happy. As an artist you pay more attention to your 
intuition rather than technicalities, so nailing down the technical aspect 
is always an achievement. De-installing when the exhibit was over was 
definitely heartbreaking.A:G:Do you think your personal experience and background influenced your project?
I have always been interested in the female perspective that often 
lacks representation in the art world. I am also familiar with symbols used 
in Orientalist paintings, as they are present in my culture. Armenians have 
always had a close connection to Middle Eastern cultures, which made me 
interested in the cultural diversity of the region that is often overlooked 
by the people in the West. My dad has been an inspiration as well, as he 
is highly devoted to art, even though it is not his main profession at the 
moment.
I did not think about it at first, but later realized that materials which 
I have used had special meaning for me since I was a child. I collected 
different papers, stickers and materials, and found special power in them.A:G:
The central piece of your exhibit is the deconstruction of the famous 
“Grande Odalisque” painting by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres. A 
feminist group, Guerrilla Girls, also appropriated the same painting in their 
most well-known poster. Were you inspired by the group in any way or is it just a 
coincidence?
I definitely was. I learned about them in high school, and I thought 
their ideas were really cool. I did not see the connection between their 
work and mine right away, because initially I did not expect my project 
to have a feminist perspective. But constantly being in the dialogue 
about how people are represented in art, I started asking myself why the 
woman on “Grande Odalisque” was represented this way, who is she being 
presented by, who is profiting of her exploitation. And Guerrilla Girls pose 
these questions in their art too.A:G:
What feedback did you receive from people who came to see your work?
I use a lot of craft-based materials, usually associated with childhood 
and femininity to deconstruct classic images created with high-culture 
materials, such as oil paint. So many people said they felt a connection 
to my work, because they used to scrapbook when they were children. 
This allowed me to talk about a more complex issue of representation of 
the Eastern world in Western art in a more familiar manner. In fact, we 
often do not give enough credit to other cultural legacies — Picasso often 
borrowed from African imagery, but African art is largely seen as primitive 
relative to the Western art.
However, I recognize that [the] student audience is more aware of the 
issue of representation. So I wonder how my works would be received in a 
more public sphere where people have different educational backgrounds. 
Showcasing my personal work to the broader audience will definitely be 
the next step.A:G:

Tritons Win an Overtime Thriller
As the second seed, UCSD hosted 
the seventh-seed Cal Poly Pomona in 
the opening round of the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
tournament. It was a hard-fought 
game but key in-game adjustments 
and an incredible offensive outburst 
from senior guard Jamie Katuna 
guided the Tritons to a 71–60 win.
The Broncos slowed the game 
down in the first quarter, not letting 
the Tritons get into their fast-paced 
offense that made them the 19th 
team in the nation in Division II. 
As a result, UCSD fell behind by 
six early on, with Cal Poly Pomona 
using the whole shot clock on every 
possession. After a three-point play 
by its center, and another basket in 
transition, Pomona was up by nine, 
18–9. Katuna scored a basket before 
the end of the quarter, but UCSD 
still trailed by seven going into the 
second quarter. 
UCSD then started playing 
the Broncos at their own game, 
implementing a full-court press. On 
the first possession of the quarter, 
the Tritons stole the ball, and junior 
guard Beth Mounier scored from 
downtown. Four minutes into the 
quarter, the Broncos still boasted a six-point advantage with Katuna 
bringing the Tritons back within 
four points on a three-pointer. 
Katuna continued to work hard and 
converted an and-one opportunity 
with two seconds left, as the Tritons 
went into halftime down 25–29.
“Pomona was really smart and we 
kind of had to adjust and play slower, ” 
Katuna said. “It took us a little while; 
it took us the whole first half to adjust. 
We talked about that at halftime. ” 
Katuna pursued her clinic, scoring 
her first two shots to tie things up at 
31, all after two minutes of play in the 
second half. UCSD continued to push 
and took a one-point lead after junior 
forward Cassie Macleod scored on 
an assist by senior forward Farrah 
Shokoor. The Tritons suddenly took 
fire and, behind Katuna and Shokoor, 
went up by five, 40–35; another 
Katuna basket pushed the lead to 
nine with a minute remaining in the 
quarter. Katuna had 27 points after 
three quarters of play and sophomore 
guard Taylor Tanita had a three-
point play with 2.6 seconds left as the 
Tritons took a 51–40 lead into the 
final quarter.
“ A lot of it is when my teammates 
can set me up for stuff like that, ” 
Katuna said. “ As I started feeling it, I 
kinda just kept throwing it up there. ” 
After two minutes and 30 seconds of play in the fourth 
quarter, the Tritons 
were sitting on top of a 
comfortable 14-point lead. 
UCSD continued to push 
forward and were up 62–44 with five 
minutes remaining. With the defense 
really stepping up, allowing for better 
offensive possessions, the Tritons 
completely turned the game around 
after a hesitant first half.
The Broncos came back within 
eight points of the Tritons with two 
minutes to play, as Katuna fouled out, 
but a beautiful runner — plus the foul 
by junior guard Beth Mounier — put 
the Tritons back up by 11. The Tritons 
then secured the win by making their 
free throws down the line to get the 
11-point win.
Katuna had a game-high 29 
points, as she hit four three-pointers 
on the night. Mounier, in turn, had 
13 points while Shokoor contributed 
with nine points and nine boards.
“We need to take it one game at a 
time, ” Katuna said. “We got one game 
and that’s how we need to look at it. ”
UCSD will now face the third-
seed Cal State East Bay on Friday 
night for the semifinal. The semifinals 
and final for the CCAA tournament 
will be held in Stockton, CA.Written by Alex Wu // Staff Writer
Photos by Megan Lee After dropping the season finale to Sonoma State on Saturday night, the 
UCSD men’s basketball team was given an opportunity for redemption 
in its California Collegiate Athletic Association quarterfinal match this 
past Tuesday night. Like their regular season finale, it was a tight affair 
for the majority of the game, but, with the help of a buzzer-beating miracle shot and 
overtime, the Tritons topped their conference rivals and earned a trip to the semifinal 
round in Stockton.
Despite finishing the half a rough 2–11 from beyond the arc, the Tritons opened 
the game with a bang thanks to senior forward Drew Dyer’s defensive rebound and 
quick three-pointer. From then on, UCSD would lead for the entirety of the first half 
and partway into the second half. However, even with the lack of lead changes, the 
Seawolves would remain within striking distance for the entiret y of the half, which 
culminated in a narrow 25–23 Triton lead.
But the Tritons weren’t alone in their three-point shooting woes; the Seawolves shot 
a similarly poor 1–8 from downtown. The teams had to earn their points in other ways: 
Both the Tritons and the Seawolves bullied their way to paint, where the teams scored 12 
points apiece. While their point totals were nearly identical, the Tritons were still able to 
out-rebound the Seawolves 20–13.
Like in so many of their games this season, the Tritons settled down and 
improved their scoring output during the second half. Despite g iving up a large 
lead, the Tritons improved to 12–23 shooting overall, scoring 31 points in their 
duel with the Seawolves in a half that ended in the most exciti ng way possible: 
An unbelievable last-second shot.
Down three with just over a second left in regulation, Dyer rem inded 
everyone what it means to be clutch. Sophomore forward Kenny Fr aser 
seamlessly relayed an inbound pass from senior forward Zach McM illan 
which Dyer converted to a drilling buzzer-beating three-pointer.
“I don’t know if I can put it into words,” UCSD Head Coach Eric 
Olen told the UCSD Athletics Department. “We drew up a play and 
they executed it perfectly.”
“Coach drew up a play,” McMillan said. “He had Kenny throw 
the ball to me, hopefully. I got a catch and handed it to Drew. It 
worked out, and Drew made a big shot.”
However, the Seawolves weren’t intimidated as they quickly rushed out to 
five points within the first couple of minutes of overtime. But t hanks to a quick 
couple of scores by junior guard Adam Klie, the Tritons were able to regain the 
lead and finally close out the Seawolves 71–66.
“We were excited to get back to play those five minutes,” McMillan said. “I 
finally felt like myself, played a lot of minutes and felt healt hy out there.”
Game hero Dyer finished the game with a team-high 17 points, six  rebounds 
and four assists to go along with it; Klie and McMillan were cl ose behind with 
14 and 13 points respectively, McMillan leading the team with seven boards, 
while Klie tied Dyer for a team-high four assists.
“We’re super excited to play against Pomona on Friday, and we’re excited to 
get there and get a shot at playing them,” McMillan said.
With the win, UCSD advances to the CCAA semifinals to face off against 
third-seeded Cal Poly Pomona in Stockton on March 4.

The No. 13 Tritons spent 
the weekend at the UC Irvine 
Invitational held at the Anteater 
Aquatics Center on Feb. 27 and 28. 
On the opening day, the Tritons 
lost game one, 8–7, against No. 5 
UC Davis. However, UCSD bounced 
back in game two as it defeated 
No. 14 Loyola Marymount 9–8. 
But the rollercoaster continued as 
the Tritons lost their first game on 
Sunday against No. 7 Arizona State, 
9–5, only to come back and win their 
second game of the day against No. 
12 University of Pacific. The Tritons 
are now 8–6 overall. 
Game One
UCSD’s defense was strong to 
start the game as it shut out UC 
Davis during the first quarter, 
with senior attacker Emma Sasson 
scoring a goal and giving UCSD 
an early lead. During the second 
quarter, UCSD’s junior two-meter 
defender Alexis Wieseler scored 
twice while junior attacker Connie 
Wu and junior center Lauren Boyer 
each scored one goal for the Tritons. 
Nonetheless, UC Davis was able to score four goals during the second 
quarter, making the score 5–4 in the 
Tritons’ favor heading into halftime.
UC Davis’s scoring streak 
continued throughout the third 
quarter, as it scored four more goals 
and shut out the Tritons, making 
the score 8–5 in the Aggies’ favor 
heading into the final quarter. 
UCSD inarguably showed some 
fight in the fourth quarter as its 
senior goalkeeper Courtney Miller 
stopped everything that came her 
way, continuing to shut out the 
Aggies. Although Wieseler had her 
third goal of the game, completing 
the hat trick, and Boyer scored 
her second of the game, it was 
not enough to get the win for the 
Tritons; the final score was 8–7. 
Game Two
The LMU Lions took the lead 
early in the match, as they led the 
Tritons 3–2 in the first quarter.
Yet the second proved to be a big 
quarter, as Sasson, along with senior 
attackers Laurel Kistler and Julia 
Kirkland, scored one goal each to 
give the Tritons a 5–3 lead heading into halftime. 
Although the Tritons allowed the 
Lions to score four goals in the third 
quarter, they scored three goals 
themselves, keeping the lead as they 
headed into the final quarter 8–7. 
UCSD junior two-meter defender 
Lani Tittle scored early in the fourth 
quarter before LMU squeezed one 
past Miller. The Tritons then hung 
on for the win against the Lions 9–8. 
Boyer had a hat trick while Kistler 
and Kirkland had two goals each in 
the victory. 
“[I’m] very proud of the way we 
rebounded in tonight’s game against 
LMU, ” UCSD Head Coach Brad 
Kreutzkamp told UCSD Athletics. 
“We really came together, and I was 
very proud of probably our most 
well-rounded team win of the year. ” 
Game Three
Kistler scored the first goal of the 
match, giving the Tritons an early 
lead, but a goal at the end of the 
first quarter by ASU’s senior center 
Abbey Kerth tied the game at 1–1.
The Tritons gave up four goals 
during the second quarter, despite getting one goal apiece from 
Wieseler and Tittle, and trailed 5–3 
heading into halftime.
Boyer scored twice in the third 
quarter, but that was not enough to 
take the lead against ASU’s powerful 
offense; the Sun Devils scored three 
more goals in the third quarter, 
making the score 8–5 before the 
final quarter of the game. Again, the 
Tritons failed to score, but the Sun 
Devils scored once more to secure 
their 9–5 vic tory. 
Game Four
The Tritons took the lead early 
after goals from Sasson and Wieseler 
in the first quarter, despite allowing 
the Tigers to score one goal; each 
of them scored another goal during 
the second quarter. The Tigers then 
scored three goals during the second 
quarter, tying the game up 4–4 going 
into halftime.
Although the Tigers scored two 
more goals early in the third quarter, 
the Tritons’ defense shut them down 
for the remainder of the game.
But Sasson scored again, completing the hat trick and 
cutting the Tiger’s lead to one goal. 
Freshman center Chanel Schilling 
tied the game up, then Wieseler 
scored her third goal of the game 
as she gave the Tritons a one-goal 
advantage; the score ended up being 
7–6 in the Tritons’ favor as the team 
headed into the fourth quarter.
Wieseler then scored her fourth 
goal of the game while Tittle scored 
her first, adding two more insurance 
goals for the Tritons. The final score 
of the match was 9–6. 
“I was very proud of our continued 
effort to never give up, no matter how 
far behind we fall, ” Kreutzkamp told 
UCSD Athletics. “This team could 
have quit so many times, but never 
did. They continue to pick each other 
up over and over again. ”
UCSD will head to the Claremont 
Convergence tournament on March 
4 and 5 to play La Verne, Whittier, 
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps as well as 
Pomona-Pitzer. W. W A TER  POLO
