Tucked away behind the concrete facade of UCSD’s 
exterior, there runs an extensive series of commit-tees — small, isolated groups of administrators, 
faculty members and students charged with drafting the intricate policies that dictate how this campus is run. Meal plans, shuttle routes, housing costs and on-campus speech rights are just a few of the areas governed by these committees — all subject to the whims and judgment of the individuals selected to serve therein.  
The student component of this arrangement, how-
ever, may not be functioning the way it is supposed to, according to various administrators and members of stu-dent government. They claim there is a troubling lack of interaction between the students chosen to serve on these committees and the A.S. Council — the body responsible for appointing and overseeing these representatives. 
“Unfortunately — and this has been a recurring prob-
lem year after year — we don’t have very good commu-nication with our representatives, ” A.S. President Utsav Gupta said. “We don’t know if our representatives even go to their committee meetings, and we don’t know if these committees — which are actually mostly advisory in nature — are even meeting. This is really due to the fact that A.S. Council, for the most part, has not performed well in reaching out and communicating with representa-tives after they have been appointed. ”
The issue of accountability among campuswide com-
mittees has been popping up more and more lately. Students, admin. allege patchy 
attendance, poor communication.

At a meeting of the UCSD Academic Senate 
on April 27, faculty members defended the 
university’s admissions policy, denying claims by the UC Board of Regents that the policy fails to create a racially diverse student population. 
The regents, including UC President Mark 
G. Yudof, criticized UCSD’s comprehensive-review system during a meeting in March, sug-gesting that the system works against attempts to admit more underrepresented minority stu-dents to the campus. The regents’ assessment came shortly after a series of racist incidents at UCSD prompted questions about how to build a more diverse student body. 
“We got lambasted by all the regents and the 
president, and the assumption is that by fixing our admissions policy, it will fix campus climate and the number of underrepresented minorities on campus, ” Academic Senate Chair William Hodgkiss said. 
Committee on Admissions Chair John 
Eggers compared UCSD’s comprehensive review to the holistic review system employed 
by UC Berkeley and UCLA. Comprehensive 
review gives specific point allocations to factors such as academic achievements — which constitutes 74 percent of the total score — personal hardship and educational environment. Applicants are then ranked and admitted based on whether they make the cutoff score. However, in holistic review, applicants are evaluated overall with no spe-cific weight given to any one factor. Students are given a score from one to five to deter-mine whether they are recommended for acceptance.
In his presentation, Eggers said that —  in 
the 2009-10 academic year —  74.3 percent of students were admitted to UCLA, 23.9 percent admitted to UCSD and not UCLA and 1.9 per-cent admitted to UCLA and not UCSD. 
“When you look at the 1.9 percent of 
applicants who were admitted by UCSD but

Hundreds of students gathered at the A.S. Forum last night to watch the council 
debate a controversial resolu-tion calling for the University of California to stop investing in companies providing military technology to Israel. The resolu-tion identified the Palestinian territories as being occupied by a military force guilty of com-mitting human rights violations against the Palestinian people. The council ultimately voted 13-10-4 to create a committee to further discuss the resolution. 
The resolution, which was 
modeled after a similar effort at UC Berkeley, called for the UC Board of Regents to divest 
endowment funds from corpo-rations such as General Electric and United Technologies. According to the resolution, these companies manufacture technology used in military weapons and vehicles, such as helicopters, used in war crimes in the Middle East. 
According to Associate 
Vice President of Enterprise Operations Rishi Ghosh — who helped draft the document — the resolution is not the first of its kind. However, Ghosh said, if it had passed, it would have been the first recognition of Israel’s war crimes to be approved at a public university. Hampshire College, a private college in

SUNNY-SIDE UP By Philip Rhie
Various councilmembers — including 
both Gupta and A.S. President-elect Wafa Ben Hassine — allege that, once chosen, those who sit on the commit-tees do little to inform the council prior to making policy decisions that affect the entire campus.
For example, the Transportation 
Policy Committee will soon be voting on a measure that would cut shut-tle routes in order to compensate for Parking and Transportation Services’ current budget deficit.
In addition, last month, the 
On-Campus Housing, Dining and Hospitality Advisory Committee passed an increase in mandatory din-ing dollars — $98 more for students in the residence halls, and $75 more for those in apartments.
Though councilmembers are required to serve on at least one campuswide committee, the 
student body does not have a direct say in the appointment of representatives to most of the committees. Instead, students elect the Vice President of Student Life — a position currently held by Revelle College senior Ricsie Hernandez, and soon to be filled by Warren College sophomore Kristina Pham, as of Week Seven — who is then responsible for interviewing and appointing representatives. If a com-mittee position opens that no council-member wishes to fill, then the position is made available to the general under-graduate population.
Gupta said that, once commit-
tee members are appointed, their job descriptions — as well as their rights within the committee — are anything but clear.
Eleanor Roosevelt College senior 
Chris Westling, who spent the last two years sitting on the HDH Committee, the Bookstore Advisory Committee, the Academic Freedom Committee, the University Centers Advisory Board and the Light Rail Transit Committee — as well as attending Transportation Policy Committee meetings, as a part of the Student Sustainability Collective — said that A.S. councilmembers often fail to show up to meetings, or are unprepared when they do.
He added that the relative inexperi-
ence of these members — combined with a lack of training and institutional memory — can sometimes lead to uninformed decisions.
“Nothing [about the position] was 
really described to me beforehand, ” Westling said. “ A lot of times, frankly, the room is full with a majority of students, but the administrator has been there for 20 to 30 years, and the students are first-years — and, I don’t blame them, but they just found out what interest rates were yesterday, and then they’re voting on increasing student fees.  I’m not trying to fault these first-years, because they’re trying their best, but there’s an institutional problem there. ”
Warren College junior Priya 
Kanayson, on the other hand, said that her experience as the member at large on the HDH Committee was a posi-tive one.
“I think this is one of the few com-
mittees on campus that is basically student-driven, because all of the pro-grams that we’ve run have come from the committee and what their constitu-ents have told them, ” Kanayson said. “Overall, attendance is really good. I think last quarter we had a couple members who were sick or whatever, and they couldn’t come, but they noti-fied us and they did a good job of read-ing the minutes and knowing what was going on. ”
As a student staff representative — standing for students who work on campus — Kanayson 
does not report back to the A.S. Council. Instead, her constituents are the residence advisors and on-campus undergraduates she works and goes to school with every day. According to Hernandez, committee members that do come from the council are informed of their responsibility to communicate with their constituents before being hired to their new positions.
“I use the charge letter as the basis 
for the committee description and commitments, ” Hernandez said. “I let them know what the committee does, their role on the committee, how much time they should commit… I also let them know that a student voice is important on the committee that they are serving on. ”
Some committees — like the 
Diversity and Equity Committee — are completely lacking in student repre-sentation, based on the fact that no members show up.
“The truth is we have only seen our 
student member, like, once a year, ” Judy Varner, vice chair of the Diversity and Equality Committee, said.
In the two years she has served on 
the committee, Varner said she has seen an A.S. representative at only two of the committee’s quarterly meetings.;\]LMV\:MXZM[MV\I\Q^M[.IQT\W)XXMIZI\,Q^MZ[Q\a4QJZIZa+W UUQ\\MM5MM\QVO[

Massachusetts, has already divested 
entirely from the state of Israel. (The resolution considered by the council last night only advocated a break from corporations said to profit from Israel’s alleged war crimes.)
The bill drew stu-
dents from campus groups such as Tritons for Israel and Students for Justice in Palestine, who spoke during the public input period at the beginning of the meeting. 
Campuswide Senator-
elect Elizabeth Elman said the resolution encouraged the university to adopt a neutral stance in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by divesting from companies that sup-port Israel’s actions in the conflict.  
“I’ve heard that passing this reso-
lution will divide our UCSD commu-nity on an issue that is far removed from this campus, ” she said. “I would argue that we are already divided. 
I believe that discuss-ing this resolution is the first step in reuniting our community. This resolution divests from American companies whose business solely benefits the war efforts of one side in this con-flict will help restore the neutrality that our student body so vocally desires. ”
However, Tritons for 
Israel President Dafna Barzilay argued that the legislation was biased and that passing it would alienate the pro-Israel community on campus. She said that 
the pro-Israel committee had been unfairly excluded from the drafting “We definitely would like student 
inpu t,
” Varner said. “The trouble right 
now is that we are trying to deal with all of the issues that have arisen out of the racially motivated conflicts on campus, and it’s a lot of extra work — and cer-tainly, student-faculty interaction is one of the things we’ d like to see improved. ”
Trevor Buchanan, chair of the 
Library Committee, said this is not a new problem: Student attendance at meetings has been historically  infre-quent. However, he added that repre-sentatives do contribute when present.
“There’s plenty of opportunity for 
students to input things in the com-mittee if they show up, ” Buchanan said. “We have had very good representa-tives before… Part of the problem we have with the A.S. representatives is that they don’t always show to the meetings, and we’re often not assigned 
representatives in a timely fashion. ” 
According to the A.S. charter, 
dealing with the failure of committee appointees to show up for meetings is the responsibility of the VP Student Affairs. In response, Hernandez said that she feels that, overall, student rep-resentatives are communicating well with the council.
“I believe that there is enough stu-
dent oversight, in that college council and A.S. are having representatives and they are reporting back to college coun-cil and A.S., ” Hernandez said. “I have never fired someone from a committee. If I were to fire someone, it would have to be because they are not showing up to committee meetings. ”
There are 44 committees total, ranging from the Transportation Policy Committee — at the cen-
ter of a contentious debate this year over whether students should pay into the campus shuttle system — to the some-what less divisive Tritonlink Advisory Committee.
The A.S. website states that com-
mittee representatives must “keep open communication and constant updates with the A.S. Vice-President of Student Life, ” as well as report information back to the council — something both Hernandez and Gupta acknowledged current representatives don’t always do.
According to Hernandez, part of 
the difficulty in achieving full commu-nication with these committees is their inconsistent meeting times.
“Certain committees meet once a 
week, [but] other committee represen-tatives meet once a quarter, so they only check in with me once a quar-ter, ” Hernandez said. “I’ve been having them e-mail me updates, and I’ve been really asking them to do it — but if they don’t, I don’t know what to say. ”
Ben Hassine said the only way 
to avoid instances like the meal-plan increase — which passed in the HDH committee before it could be discussed by the council — is by making quarter-ly updates a mandatory part of serving as a student committee member.
“We should change the stand-
ing goals to say that representatives from different committees have to report back to council every week; if they don’t meet, then they can say ‘We didn’t meet, ’” Ben Hassine said. “ Additionally, if any big-ticket changes such as increases in rent or increases in dining dollars are being considered, I think the representatives should be required to make some king of formal report... not just an oral one during council. ”
Ben Hassine was serving as an A.S. 
representative on the HDH Committee when it passed the meal-plan increase. 
Westling said that appointees 
should not underestimate the effect that policies can have on campus life.
“Y ou have UCAB, and HDH and 
the Transportation Policy Committees, specifically, and a couple others — they have a tremendous amount of power, ” Westling said. “That’s probably one of A.S. ’ most powerful avenues to protect student rights, is through these com-mittee memberships. ”

Sponsored bynot UCLA, you start to see some dis-
turbing trends, ” he said. 
According to Eggers, of the 1.9 per-
cent not admitted to UCSD, the average UCSD comprehensive score is 300 to 400 points below the UCLA admissions cutoff score, and the average academic profile is lower in every category. He said that 37.6 percent come from fami-lies with high parental income, 88.3 percent were not first -generation col-lege students and 93.5 percent were not from fourth or fifth quintile schools. 
“UCLA didn’t admit them because 
of low parental income, ” Eggers said. “Most of them weren’t first-generation students [and] didn’t come from bad schools, so that wasn’t the reason. After reflecting on the admissions data, we cannot determine why UCLA admitted these applicants. ” 
He added that UCSD accepted 
similar numbers of underrepresented 
minority students, but had historically low yield when compared to UCLA and Berkeley. 
“The problem is not admitting peo-
ple to UCSD, ” he said. “The problem is getting them to come — that’s called yield, and that’s what we should be working on, not targeting the compre-hensive review system. ”

Each year, come spring, the 
novelty of around-the-clock burrito access has worn off, 
and most students don’t know what to do with their gobs of excess dining dollars.
The Housing, Dining and 
Hospitality department, however, thinks it has just the answer. As part of a new pilot program beginning May 3, students will be able to swap their meal points with each other through the end of the quarter — the idea being that a student who is out 
of points will buy some from a friend 
with a surplus. 
Whoopdie-fucking-doo.Of course, there’s little harm in 
giving on-campus residents more control over the meal plans to which they’re already chained. After all, most of us don’t have the appetite — nor the trust fund — to blow our excess dining dollars on a two-speed blender from Goody’s Market.  
But HDH’s half-baked attempt 
to improve the system skirts the real issue at hand: An overwhelm-ing majority of students on campus

know what do with. In fact, a Winter Quarter  HDH survey found that 74 
percent of students living on campus have more meal points left than the budget suggests, while only 10 percent have less.  
And let’s not forget that budget 
suggests each student’s meal-point excess will only worsen come Fall 
Quarter 2010, when students living on 
campus will face mandatory dining-dollar increases of up to $98. 
The program is merely a test run, 
but in its current form, it’s covered in red tape. Not only must students seek out someone willing to snatch up their meal points, they also must sign off on the deal at the HDH office in Revelle College — a prospect as tempting as a cold slice of pepperoni-and-hair pizza from Plaza Cafe for the average over-scheduled student. 
Although this new program is 
being touted under the guise of stu-dent empowerment, we recommend that HDH — if the department is, in fact, interested in address-ing a problem it obviously knows is there — consider allowing students to choose from a range of dining plans at the beginning of the year. 
As it stands, 
every student in a residence hall is required to pay into a $2,795 yearly meal plan; on-campus apartments dwellers are required to pay $2,145 per year; neither has the option to buy a lesser amount. Most other major universities (including equally cash-strapped ones within the UC system) offer students a variety of meal plans, so it wouldn’t be unheard of for HDH to at least look into doing the same. In the mean-
time, we’ll have to make do with 
the department 
gouging us 
— with a 
cherry 
on top.

It is four o’ clock in the morning and the acrid taste of lukewarm coffee sits heavy on my tongue. 
Physically, I am very much awake. My right leg shakes uncontrollably and I have developed an acute twitch in my left temple. Mentally, I have been asleep for more than 30 minutes. 
This odd separation of body 
and mind temporarily affords me a unique perspective into the absur-dity of my situation. Tasked with completing a six-page essay, I have instead plunged headlong into the grim depths of academic desperation, grasping wildly for answers, swinging blindly at questions, falling rapidly closer to the infinite vacuum of per-manent scholarly confusion. My arms are sore. My head is blank. My Word document is significantly blanker.
But I cannot move forward. Some 
distant part of me is so weighted down by the sudden enormity of this task, so crushed and cornered and revolted by the horrifying prospect of forging on, that I retreat, defeated, into this strange comatose state of waking sleep. I am frozen in place, propped upright in my chair like some insane mannequin — eyes wide, mouth open, hair slick with grease. I think, therefore I am awake. If only it were that simple.
A break would be good. I should 
take a break.
Outside on my balcony the early 
morning air is cold and wet. There are no cars, no people — just the dis-tant hum of a now muted Interstate 5 and the always-present glare of the palatial Mormon temple that looms, guard-like, over my sleeping neighborhood. This is the quiet time, the changing hour, the moment just before one day becomes another — before alarms go off and breakfast is made and dogs are walked. This is the time to think. This is the time to realize.
In five hours I will turn in this 
essay. In five hours I will have either succeeded or failed. The feeling that washes over me now is a familiar one. Do or die. It always comes down to this; the final stretch, the last push. Gather your wits about you. Collect your thoughts. Make your fingers move across the keyboard. Five hours. Five hours.
Nights like this are never easy. 
They are a test. They strip you down and beat you to the edge of con-sciousness. They pull at your weakest parts, push you to confront your lim-its, make you realize your capacity for pain, for exhaustion, for frustration. Nights like this are primal, raw. Man versus task; student versus midterm. 
Back inside I am filled with a 
renewed vigor. Body and mind are reunited as one. Keys click as fingers fly — the rhythmic dance of ideas becoming words, of thoughts becom-ing permanent. I am the thinker, the conductor — a director of movement, a maker of things. I will pour myself into this task. I will push myself to breaking. I will succeed.
It is five o’ clock in the morning

GroundNo Torture 
Compares to the Late-Night Grind
ILLUSTRATIONS  BY REBEKAH  HWANG /GUARDIANAs much as we rag on our 
student leaders for wasting valuable floor time making 
empty statements — aka resolutions, or press releases proclaiming the student body’s stance on a major issue — we do admit there are cer-tain moments at which they are not entirely worthless.
Seeing as the A.S. Council isn’t 
in the position to do anything con-crete about global problems (besides maybe allot $370 to InterVarsity to throw a Haiti fundraiser), its greatest power in affecting change might be turning a few more heads to a cause — a cause greater than fighting the unjust confinement of the Sun God Festival to RIMAC Field.
For example, the A.S. movement 
to divest university money from South Africa in 1986 was a clear statement the students could make to push international injustice into public discourse. In the end, the university did withdraw $3 billion from investments in South Africa — partially due to the will of its student government.Just a week ago, though, an 
especially contentious resolution hit the A.S. listserv: the Resolution in Support of Peace and Neutrality Through UC Divestment From U.S. Corporations Profiting From Occupation. In other words: the resolution to withdraw UC funds from two large U.S. companies that sell military technology to Israel.
Though the document would 
have — like another resolution to divest from Sudan in 2005 — taken a daring stance against financial sup-port for oppressive violence, it spe-cifically targeted (yet simultaneously avoided the specific mention of) Israel, which was blatantly implied to be the occupier in question.
The UC investment in Israel 
is especially roundabout; General Electric and United Technology pro-vide hundreds of other services and products within our own country, and the university does invest any-where that could fund Israeli weap-onry in particular (nor in the form of student fees). For that reason, the divestment would be very symbolic — the symbol being that we con-demn Israel for its wartime actions, and anyone who supports those actions. Thing is, many students do not see the issue quite so black-and-white; that’s where the A.S. Council’s constituents are divided, and have been for years. 
The council tried to pass a clearer 
version of this resolution last year; it didn’t pass, because of a similar divide on whether wartime crimes are indeed being committed (or at least whether that fact should be amended by Israel’s reasons for violence). But if the resolution’s only hope to pass is with its clear objective masked in “evil corporation” language, it is divisive. If it had been voted through council last night in its current form, it would not have represented the interests of the student body. 
When an elected student council 
(mostly made up of students most invested in controversial issues like these — though their political stanc-es are rarely clear to voters through-

LETTER  TO THE  EDITOR
Dear Editor,
The A.S. divestment resolution 
advances prima facie, a concern for 
human rights. No one disputes the 
need for mechanisms like regional institutions to protect international human rights. However, the resolu-tion does not advance those goals of human-rights protection, and instead unfairly maligns and dishon-estly targets the state and people of Israel.
It is important to know the 
magnitude of the Israeli-Palestinian strife, but like all conflicts, the causes, actors and institutions involved are varied and multifaceted. I was in Israel during the Gaza War a year and a half ago, and it is clear to me that the A.S. resolution fails to give sufficient color to the crisis facing the Middle East, and instead misjudges the current state of affairs.
On a research note, as a graduate 
student, I am deeply disturbed by the biased nature of sources and the rhetoric adopted by the authors and supporters of the resolution. First, Israel bears no resemblance to South Africa, having unilaterally disengaged from the Gaza Strip in 2005. By con-trast, Hamas and the Al Aksa Martyrs Brigade have singly targeted the Jewish population, having killed 1,000 innocent Israelis. 
Secondly, measures from unbi-
ased researchers have reported major improvements in terms of Israeli compliance of international human rights accords in the past decades. Israel remains the only state in the Middle East that protects and advances women’s and LGBT rights. Measures of democratic development and civil liberties also reflect a high degree of free speech, free press and an open and vibrant multi-party sys-tem that includes Arabs and Muslims.
Finally, as an Asian-American 
with parents coming from a country that does repress human rights, I see active discussions on campus concerning human rights in Iran and creative student efforts led by Liberty in North Korea on very real human-rights abuses in North Korea. Maybe the A.S. Council should look into those efforts. But for the time being, A.S. resolutions need to be respon-sible and should contain verifiable claims that advance honest inquiry. This resolution fails on those counts.

Keep Us Talking — The Conversation’s Just Begun
out the campaign) makes a decision 
still so contended by its constituents, it’s a false statement, and devalues the resolution as a form of mass speech. It is a room of 20-odd students stating their opinion like it matters more than the rest of ours.
We do not so much mean to say 
that maintaining a pristine campus cli-mate should be the priority; there are always two sides when it comes to war, and the tension is justified. Instead, the A.S. Council should strive for com-plete honesty in its resolution language and a maximum effort toward educa-tion. The best thing we can do for either Israel or the Palestinian people is alert those around us to exactly what is going on in that region.Whether or not it is in self-
defense, the United Nations and Amnesty International have both recognized that Israel is indeed com-mitting human-rights violations in the occupied Palestinian territories. 
The sentiment that a resolution 
stating as much would make mem-bers of the pro-Israel community feel “unsafe” is overstated. Criticizing a gov-ernment for committing war crimes is a far cry from criticizing a people, or even a country. The terrorist acts committed by the Palestinian side are widely condemned; however, because the Jewish homeland has always been a fragile topic — and a country we’re tied to in more ways than one — the U.S. is among the last countries in the world to recognize those crimes. But there are two sides, and both 
need to be heard. The council should have at least sent out the resolution over the all-campus listserv before considering it in a room with extrem-ists from both sides. So, in a way, as boring and half-assed a decision it was to push the resolution back to be revisited next week, it’ll make us keep considering the facts. Even if the resolution must be re-proposed each quarter, we hope its language can become clear enough to address the true wrongdoings in question — which belong more to a government than a weapons manufacturer — and promote teach-ins, Library Walk info booths and enough open-air hubbub to foster the kind of informed interest this topic deserves.

of the resolution and that the pro-
Israel community had only three days to formulate a response before the vote at last night’s A.S. Council meeting.
“My community is feeling threat-
ened, and we’re feeling unsafe, ” she said. “One thing I would like to urge is that this is not a pro-peace resolu-tion. It is marketed to be one — how-ever, I would like to maintain that peace incorporates talks, negotiations and respects from both sides of any conflicted forces and this kind of movement should not be one that’s done overnight. ”
According to A.S. Director of 
Policy Initiatives Mac Zilber, the money invested into G.E. and United Technologies does not come from tuitions or student fees — as the reso-lution states — but instead is derived from private donations. In addition, he said that the investment money supporters the capital unit of G.E., which is a commercial leasing unit of the company and is not involved in providing military technology over-seas. 
Following public input, council-
members began to discus whether the resolution was an appropri-ate topic to discuss.   A motion by Campuswide Senator Katie Hall to table the motion indefinitely failed 13-16-2 with 13 members voting in favor of tabling, 16 voting against and 3 abstaining.
Vice President of Student Life 
Ricsie Hernandez proposed that the original version of the resolution be amended and instead be replaced with a version created by Campuswide Senator Tobias Haglund. Haglund’s version removes all mention of Israel or Palestine and instead states that the council does not condone the financial support of companies that invest in military occupation in any country. 
Ghosh said he would support the 
amended version of the resolution.
“That version was terribly 
watered down and a lot of people in our community weren’t happy with it, but I would have voted for it, ” Ghosh said.
The amendment passed, but the 
issue was eventually voted to be dis-charged into a committee chaired with Speaker James Lintern, who resigned from the position at the end of the meeting. 
“I didn’t volunteer for this posi-
tion and this committee is going to fail in a big way, ” he said. “I didn’t have good experiences with the coun-cil on this last year, and nothing’s going to happen with it. ”
Hall, who voted for the issue to 
be discharged, argued that the debate should be resolved only once both groups have had equal input into the resolution. 
“My problem is that there are 
members of Students for Justice in Palestine on this council, but there are hardly any members of Tritons for Israel on this council to have their voices be heard on this resolution, ” Hall said. 
Ghosh said that he was disap-
pointed with the outcome since the original resolution had already been so radically altered. 
“The last compromise really could 
have been passed, it was very trans-parent, ” he said. “They knew it was about to pass so they voted it into committee where people can keep bringing up new things. ”
Ghosh said that he would bring 
up the resolution again at the 2009-10 council’s final meeting of the year, 
which will be held next week. 
“Next time I won’t bring up the 
compromised document but instead 
the original document, ” he said. “I’m just going to keep bringing it up again and again and it might take 10 years, but divestment will pass. ”

Ilove all-nighters.
I love that I get so desperate for 
a distraction that I’ll read every-
thing Pandora.com has to say about 
The Pink Spiders. I love that, the night I wrote my capstone paper for INTL 190, I reviewed most of the new Scorpions album on my Twitter.
But other than all-nighters, I spend 
about 90 percent of my time listening 
to the same stuff. Back in high school, 
I scratched the shit out of my sister’s copy of Meteora  by playing it on infi-
nite repeat. I like to stay in my little musical nest, all comfy and familiar.
Of course, as associate editor of the 
Guardian ’s Hiatus section, I’m sup-
posed to be a music expert — little bit of a problem there. So, on Saturday, I went to a few album emporiums armed with $40. The initial idea was to experience Record Store Day — which celebrates indie music stores with cookouts, fat sales and limited-edition releases from Jack White — and write a column about it. 
Or maybe I’ d write about the 
shrinking group of people with a hard-on for vinyl records. When I arrived at my first stop, though, I found a couple of folding plastic tables, covered inch-for-inch in cardboard boxes of $1 CDs. 
So much for that plan.At 10:45 a.m., I snagged a park-
ing spot just outside of Hillcrest, less than a block from M-Theory Music. Even that early, the cheapo CDs were already being picked over while “Evil Woman” played on a portable turn-table. I took station between a couple other magpies, in front of what used to be the ‘F’-through-‘I’  section of some-
one’s CD collection.
The first grab was Faster Pussycat’s 
Whipped  — for the simple reason 
that I recognized the name — fol-lowed quickly by Wilco and We Were Promised Jetpacks, for the same rea-son. Camarosmith goes into the buy pile for merely sounding ridiculous. Final score: six albums for $6.53, and the cashier even knocked the pennies off the price tag.
So what am I listening to in the 
wake of my victory, after making the great leap out of a familiar nest? Oasis’ (What’s the Story) Morning Glory?, from which you may have heard a little number called “Wonderwall. ”
Yikes. Given I know the story of 
how the Gallaghers chose who would sing the title track by heart — and occasionally use its title as a pickup line — it’s hard to pretend I’m branch-ing out. I’ve got a Da Bears CD still in its cellophane and a hot little LP of indie rock that’s never been spun before, both waiting patiently for me in my the back seat of my Corolla — but here I am, listening to the Gallagher twins.
My name is Matthew, and I have a 
problem.
So for you brigands ‘n’ bastards 
still reading this (all three of you), I’m throwing down the gauntlet. Give me shit on my Twitter (@off_the_rails) if I’m still jabbering about Oasis, or bet-ter yet, send me more primo tracks. I guarantee I’ll listen to anything sent to me.
Just remember, if you’re the asshole 
who sends me anything by Muse: No jury will convict me, and no K9 will find the pieces.In eyeliner, stilettos, panty-hose and a pungent cloud of hairspray, Semi Pre-
cious Weapons frontman Justin Tranter is about to turn Kuncocshun — Sixth College’s annual music fest — into a glam-rock apocalypse.
The New Y ork-based rock-
ers are BFFs with Lady Gaga, and opened for her last tour — so yes, they’re a little insane. Who would have thought our very own Warren Field might one day ring in a charming number about getting blue-balled by the savior? “She only wants to fuck Jesus!” Tranter will cry in a fabulous rage, no doubt making Jesus Guy break into a fit of blasphemous sei-zures back on Library Walk.
At least there’ll be some 
segway band: the much tamer Automatic Loveletter — four-chord rockers with a grrrl on the mic, like Paramore gone acoustic — and Violet Sun, 
who do zoned-out vocals over angst-rock instrumentation.
Once the Weapons takes the 
stage, Tranter will be wailing through ’70s-punk nostrils as the rest of the band jams heavy and fast — a battle in screams between frontman and guitar. Jonesin’

Choreographer Trixi Anne Agiao tells it straight: 
the dance department’s upcoming show will spend a significant 
amount of time lingering in the abstract. But who would expect anything less from a school whose nonscience departments compensate by 
living and breathing every-
thing experimental? 
The dances in Spring 
Moves 2010 are based on topics like corporations, the natural cycles of life on Earth and one of the choreographers’ drawings of a little girl — launching the audience through a tum-bling arrangement of conceptual spaces.
Agiao, a Warren College 
senior, said she is confident that all people will find enjoyment in the pieces, even if they can’t quite figure out what the hell is going on.
“I don’t want to say that our 
show is audience-friendly — because that implies that other shows aren’t — but it’s some-
thing that you’ll really enjoy, ” Agiao said. “If you like dance, there’s something for you. ”Five undergraduate choreographers — Yvonne 
Ackerman, Michelle Anthony, Morgan McGreevey, Arthur Huang and Agiao — are showcasing their original work from April 29 to May 1 at the Molli & Arthur Wagner Dance Building, Studio III.
Set to a score that morphs from the calming 
clinks of broken piano chords to a lively string ensemble, Agiao’s piece depicts a character who finds she needs human support to overcome life’s obstacles.
“I watch this person grow up and watch them 
go through hard times, ” Agiao said. “Somewhere

For most people, 
turning 40 usually involves an existential 
crisis and a sports car. Unfortunately, for James Murphy of LCD Sound-system, it signals the end of an era — and, by default, the end of LCD Soundsystem. His vow to discontinue the musical venture when he turned 40 means that — since reaching the milestone in February — the band’s latest album This Is Hap-
pening  could very well be 
their last. 
It’s a dishearten-
ing reality, considering Soundsystem has been responsible for some of the most acclaimed musi-cal innovation of the past decade. Since the release of ubiquitous first single “Losing My Edge, ” DFA Records founder and producer James Murphy has crafted sharp elec-tronica that straddles the line between danceability, comedy and bittersweet reflection. 
Murphy successfully 
carries on this legacy with Happening . His combina-
tion of derisive lyrics and a constant rhythmic drive are stronger than ever — most notably on tracks like first single “Drunk Girls, ” which lambasts (you guessed it) all those drunk bitches we love to hate at parties.
Almost in defiance to 
his own mockery, Murphy quickly turns to a more personal page of his diary. “ All I Want” — one wist-ful take on a relationship, buried in distorted guitars and fuzzy feedback — is the album’s first grounda-tion to seriousness, and ends up one of the album’s best tracks.
Almost every song on 
Happening  is longer than 
five minutes — typically a sign of pretentious drivel, which isn’t entirely absent here. The longest (and snobbiest) track is ironi-cally entitled “Y ou Wanted A Hit, ” which arrogantly concludes: “Maybe we don’t do hits. ” However, Soundsystem makes every snub-nosed second worth it. 
This Is Happening 
cements Murphy’s ten-ure as an electro-rock god. While the album doesn’t stray far from the cowbell-heavy, analog-rich electronica the band has honed over their eight-year run, the sound is perfected so seamlessly that it’s impossible to complain.

TRACKREVIEW
‘Not Myself Tonight’
Christina AguileraRCA RECORDS
Madonna’s legacy has carved a 
curious motto for every modern pop diva: Consistency is boring; 
reinvention is key. Christina Aguilera has followed Madge’s lead with unfail-ing enthusiasm, transforming from Mickey Mouse Club cherub to X-rated tranny and retro soul mama — and now, it looks like she’ll be a futuristic dance-club robot. “Not Myself Tonight” is filled with thumping Euro-style bleeps and lyrics about taking shots and breaking a sweat on the dance floor. At first it may sound more like Britney — or even a toned-down Gaga — than reinvention, but Aguilara’s out-of-this-world voice doesn’t fail her: Gaga could never reach these highs and groans.  
—Arielle Sallai 
Associate Hiatus Editor6
10Long Beach natives Avi Buffalo have just barely graduated high school, but that hasn’t stopped them from 
seizing the undying love of Pitchfork’s buzz-meter. Signed to Sub Pop — the Seattle indie label that made the Shins a household name — Buffalo will most likely become the Fleet Foxes of 2010. 
After building live hype at vegan 
restaurants and this year’s South By Southwest festival, Avi Buffalo have finally recorded their self-titled debut. And Pitchfork’s right: It’s no letdown.
Seeing as their chins are still cov-
ered in peach fuzz, this foursome’s sound is mature beyond their years. With soft-spoken, dreamy vocal trails and warm psychedelic guitars, they channel the best of 1960s folk-rock.
But metaphorical coming-of-age 
desires often devolves into clumsy poetry that just doesn’t make sense. “Summer Cum” romantically (and unsubtly) pleads some unlucky girl to “leave all your stains with me. ” The hidden message is anyone’s guess.
Opener “Truth Sets In” is compa-
rable to the childish musings of Kimya Dawson — posterchild of the “Juno” soundtrack — with its simplistic acous-tic strums and cutesy vocals about the wonders of growing up.
The album’s core appeal comes in 
the form of abundant harmony. Lead singer Avigdor Zahner-Isenberg’s boyish chant complements keyboard-ist Rebecca Coleman’s soulful, jangly melodies from fade-in to fade-out.
Buffalo’s optimism makes them an 
exciting act to look out for, but let’s just hope they don’t mature too fast — Zahner-Isenberg’s high-pitched hums aren’t likely to survive the ravages of puberty.

out so far. It’s pretty exciting.
G: No rest for the wicked.
JT: Y eah, no rest ever;  fuck that. 
We don’t want to rest. We want to become the most loved and hated 
band in the entire world before 2010 is over. Can’t really rest to accom-plish that.G: At some point, I saw on one of 
the band biographies — did Lady Gaga open for you guys at one point?JT: Y es. …We met her through a friend of a friend, [heard] that she was a big fan of ours and we went and checked her out on good old MySpace in 2006. She was fucking amazing, and obviously we’re a rock band with our shows —  really fun 
and really over the top — and hav-ing boring hipster bands that stare at their feet open for us didn’t really work out too well. So having this crazy girl singing pop songs, light-ing shit on fire [and] holding a disco ball was definitely a much better option. And it was amazing … Here we are in 2010 playing arenas, so can’t complain.G: I believe I saw that all of you 
went to music school together — or 
almost all of you?JT: Y es, that’s our dirty little secret: that we’re actually all classically trained and educated musicians. So we met in school at Boston; we all went to Berklee College of Music in Boston. We met the first week, but we didn’t really start the band until we were done with college. We all studied every kind of music you can. Our drummer has a degree in classical composition, and I have a degree in songwriting — what-ever the fuck  that means. Once we 
finished school and had studied all this intense intellectual music, we decided that we wanted to get back to the music that inspired us as teenagers, which was filthy rock ‘n’ roll. So here we are.G: When you guys went back to 
filthy glamour rock ‘n’ roll, were you already on the way to being the stage personalities that you are, that the whole band is right now — or did that come right after music school?JT: My stage personality is my real-life personality; it’s just who I am. It’s been on and off since I was 15. I’ve been drinking ridiculous 
and looking ridiculous and all those good things, but when we all moved to New Y ork, we were all really shocked by how boring New Y ork was. We thought it was going to be like all of the War-hol documen-taries … that I would watch as a teenager. Then I got there, and there’s a bunch of girls more concerned with drinking Cos-
mos than listening to rock ‘n’ roll. The boredom of New Y ork inspired us to be even more ridiculous … kind of piss everyone off in a good way.G: Have you guys played universi-
ties before, or is this the first one?JT: This is the first one. We played at Purdue [University] with Gaga, but it was an open-to-the-public show. So this is the first time we’re doing an official college show — which we’re actually really, really excited about, because the Purdue shows that we did with Gaga were the most insane  shows of the entire American tour. So I can’t wait; those kids were just fucking nuts. We actually went back there and played there twice, which was really fucking fun. And then [for] our show at Chicago on Friday,  actually 
a lot of kids from Purdue drove six 
hours to come see us in Chicago. I think music and rock ‘n’ roll is such an important thing for people from the ages of 15 to 25 that to get the chance to play at a college is pretty awesome.G: I did see something about a guy 
on your Twitter feed taking the Greyhound like eight hours and then being homeless for three days?JT: Y es! I did see that too. It’s pretty fucking amazing. He’s a good, awe-some fan of ours that has brought a lot of people to our music.G: I’m actually really interested 
to see how the crowd goes for the performance on Friday.JT: I can’t wait. All good things should be loved or hated. I think people are really surprised;  our 
fanbase is a really mixed crowd. People come to the show and don’t really know who we are. People who 
don’t think they’re going to like us  
will really, really love us. A lot of dudes, — if you will, “bros” — end up loving our show after a couple songs because the guitar solos are so 
great, and girls take off their clothes and show me their tits. There’s fun there for everybody.G: [Is there] anything else that 
you’ve got to say that you want the students of UCSD to hear?JT: Well, one: We’ve actually had a great time in San Diego many times, so we’re really, really excited to be 
back. And two: I think everyone’s gonna love the show. I’ll pour champagne in your mouth, there are guitar solos, there are six-inch heels and our goal at every show we do is to get everyone in the room laid by the time they leave.

along the way, they have to face 
themselves, get over it and snap themselves back into life. The main character ignores the other dancers on stage, gets caught up in emotion and eventually decides that ‘I can’t do this anymore, I need to come back to these people around me. ’”
The number is filled with images 
of nature — both still and moving — including the metamorphosis of a cat-erpillar into a butterfly. Agiao said she draws parallels between the character she created and herself. 
“ As dancers, the way we work 
through things is by dancing, ” she said. “In my life, there are three things: friends, family and dance. ”
Her handpicked cast of 16 helps 
carry out the journey, which Agiao said she has been planning since the end of the 2008-09 academic year. Watching her brainchild come together has been a rewarding experi-ence for the senior, who previously only choreographed for one other major production.
“It’s always fun and exciting when 
things get finished, ” Agiao said. “The dancers are excited, too. ”
Although she said the show is best 
described as a contemporary dance performance, Agiao said it often tran-scends the tranquility of the genre.
“I have dancers in my piece that 
can fly off the floor, ” she said.
Of the five pieces, only Anthony’s 
and Ackerman’s will feature profes-sional solos — the other three use solely undergraduate dance students. 
“Expect a show that is short and 
sweet, ” Agiao said. “It will feel like no time has gone by. Expect to see a lot of amazing dances and amazing images. There’s such a range of everything. ”

said. “But we played with our hearts 
and left it on the field” .
On Sunday, the Tritons knew they 
needed to take Game Three of the series to keep any hopes for the play-offs alive. Lesovsky took the lead, hitting a home run in the first inning. Although San Bernardino evened the score by the end of the first inning, the Tritons continued to tack on runs — one in the third inning, two in the sixth and one in the seventh — and held on for a 5-2 win.
Gaito was again a force on the 
mound, restricting the Coyotes to only two runs in seven innings for her second complete game performance in as many days. She improved her personal season record to 18-10 — the No. 4 best single-season tally in school history — and finished the regular season having pitched 21 complete games in 28 starts. 
UCSD fell in the back end of the 
doubleheader for the second straight day, sealing a series loss.
In the top of the second inning, De 
Fazio drove the ball over left field for her first career home run. Lesovsky then followed with one of her own in the third inning — giving her one home run in each of the series’ games. Ousley also produced another solo homer — her second of the season — to put a third Triton run on the board.
However, the Coyotes matched the 
Triton’s scoring quickly, surging ahead with a three-run fifth inning to take a 6-3 advantage that they refused to relinquish. The series split against San Bernardino caused the Tritons to slip down to sixth place in the CCAA; they are now eliminated from confer-ence playoff contention.
“We don’t like the feeling of los-
ing, ” Lesovsky said. “We’ll remember that for next year so that it won’t happen again, in order to make it all the way. ”
Despite missing out on a top-
three conference finish, the season was still a historic one for the team. The Tritons’ regular-season winning percentage of .600 — thanks to their 30-20 finish — is the highest the school has seen since 2001.
With the CCAA regular season 
behind them, the Tritons now wait for May 9 — the day the NCAA Divison-II Championships field will be announced — to see if they will get a spot in the postseason. To earn one, UCSD will need to retain its No. 8 ranking in the western region.

or www.cafilm.org/rfc/index.htmlKyle Hughes and freshman Austin 
Hallgren. On defense, senior backup goalkeeper Phil Behm was standing in for first-choice keeper sophomore Vishnu Prathap, who had broken his hand halfway through the season.
On April 16, the shorthand-
ed Tritons were no match for the University of San Diego on its home turf. The Toreros grabbed the lead early on, and UCSD struggled to catch up. By the third quarter — playing with few substitutes against a full UCSD roster — the Tritons completely lost their momentum and suffered a heavy 15-4 loss. 
Two days later, the team traveled to 
Las Vegas to play against the University of Nevada on April 18. Y et again, Triton stamina did not last long: The Rebels broke away with the lead in the first half, forcing UCSD to scramble to catch up. Unwilling to concede the game 
after only the first half, however, the Tritons retaliated with a set of strong performances by the team’s leaders. Captains Tim Riddle, Patrick Cleary and Ari Gordon scored a combined six goals for the Tritons during a furious offensive breakaway that tied the score by the third quarter.
Unfortunately, the burst of energy 
was temporary and wasn’t enough to bring the team home with a victory. Again, with no subs on the bench, UCSD had neither the stamina nor the manpower to make it through the game against a full Nevada roster. They left Las Vegas with a 23-10 loss.
With a week of rest before their sea-
son finale against cross-town rivals San Diego State on April 24, the Tritons took time to rejuvenate and regroup. However, injuries continued to nag many key players: Offensive stalwart and senior leader Gordon was forced 
to face the Aztecs with an injured shoulder, forcing more responsibility on Cleary and Riddle in the attack.
UCSD managed to stay neck-and-
neck with the Aztecs during the first half, however, in the second half SDSU blitzed the Triton defense and sent the Tritons home with a 17-5 season-ending loss.
Riddle, reflecting on the season, 
said the team’s short roster proved to be tremendously detrimental to their success.
“We reached the decision about 
halfway through the season about the negative effects of not having enough guys on the team, ” Riddle said. “Next year, we are going to recruit as heavily as possible, and we want to have a full team next season so that we can give everyone a run for their money. ”

Junior starter Guido Knudson kept the Toro hitters at bay by hurling three innings, allowing only one run and striking out five. The offense provided Knudson with ample run support: Senior catcher Kellen Lee went three-for-four with a pair of doubles, sophomore Danny Susdorf drove in four runs and both Gregorich and Bauman scored three runs apiece. UCSD took the first game of the day at a whopping score of 10-1.
Knudson said his success on the 
mound could be attributed to the help of his battery partners — catchers Lee and junior Michael Benton — his own competitive spirit and the work he’s done with assistant coach Ryan Leake.
“I am being myself on the mound 
out there and just having fun compet-ing with each batter, ” Knudson said. “I can’t say enough about how much Kellen [Lee] and Mike [Benton] are doing behind the plate in making me a better pitcher. I also think Coach Leake really taught me to know who I am as a pitcher, and it’s made me much better on the field. ”
In the second game of the double-
header, with the CCAA champion-ship in their sights, the unrelenting Tritons battered the Toros and further demonstrated their authority in the league. Junior outfielder Kyle Saul, junior third baseman Evan Kehoe, Gregorich and Albitz combined for 12 RBIs, 11 hits and nine runs in a game where the Triton offense scored 21 runs on 22 hits. Saul hit his sixth home run of the year, while Kehoe hit his seventh.
Benefiting from plenty of run sup-
port, senior starting pitcher Kirby St. John threw five solid innings, allow-ing no runs on four hits as the Tritons clinched the CCAA title with a lop-sided 21-3 victory.
With the league title in the bag, 
the series resumed at Triton Ballpark on Sunday for Senior Day — the last home game for several graduating players. Seniors Matt Rossman, Albitz and Gregorich all turned in memo-rable performances.
Rossman, the starting pitcher, 
tossed seven scoreless innings of four-hit ball, earning the win and improv-
ing his personal record to 8-0. Behind him, Gregorich went two-for-three with a home run, two RBIs and two runs scored. Bauman went three-for-four with two runs and two RBIs as well, while Albitz broke the career hits record in the third inning.
The Tritons topped off the four-
game series sweep — their eighth of the year — with a 9-1 victory. 
“That was a special Senior Day 
to cap off an outstanding weekend, ” head coach Dan O’Brien said in an interview with the UCSD Athletic Department. “We are starting to play our best baseball at the right time. ”
 The Tritons will travel up north 
this weekend to face San Francisco State (22-28, 15-21 CCAA) in their final regular-season series of the year. 
Knudson said that while taking the  
league title is satisfying, the Tritons still have more to work for.
“First place is nice and is a testa-
ment to our work ethic and drive to win, ” Knudson said. “But it’s just the start of what we are striving for in our goals as a team. ”

Career hits by current UCSD baseball 
shortstop Vance Albitz, who became the school’s all-time hits leader on April 25. The previous record was 306.On April 28, the junior outfielder was named to the All-
CCAA First Team for the second year in a row. She led the the conference with her .413 batting average, .486 on-base percentage, .738 slugging percentage and 118 total bases.
With only a slim two-game margin separating 
the first-place UCSD baseball team from second place Cal State Dominguez Hills in league standings, a four-game series showdown between the two  California 
Collegiate Athletic Association juggernauts — from April 23 to April 25 — was postured for a tense, closely fought battle for the top spot. A series victory for the nationally ranked No. 10 Toros would see them pull closer in the standings, and under-mine the No. 2 Tritons’ regular season title push. 
However, any doubts as to the pedigree of UCSD were 
stamped out last weekend, when the Tritons clinched the CCAA regular season championship in style, sweeping Dominguez Hills by scores of 5-2, 10-1, 21-3 and 9-1. They dominated their opponents in every aspect of the game, scoring 45 runs on 71 hits throughout the four-game streak. In total, UCSD starting pitchers allowed just seven runs.
On Friday, the Tritons hosted the Toros at Triton Ballpark. 
Junior starting pitcher Tim Shibuya continued his dominant season by hurling his fourth complete game, allowing just eight hits and one earned run and improving his personal season record to nine wins and two losses. The Toros did put two on the board early, but Shibuya shut them down for the final six frames.
At the plate, UCSD senior infielder Brandon Gregorich 
went three-for-four with two doubles and four runs batted in. Senior shortstop Vance Albitz finished three-for-five with a triple, and junior outfielder Aaron Bauman went three-for-four with two runs scored. The Tritons took the series opener with a score of 5-2.

MEN’S CLUB LACROSSE — Facing 
the last three games of the season 
against the University of San Diego, 
the University of Nevada, Las Vegas 
and San Diego State, the UCSD men’s lacrosse club team hoped to reverse its prior three-game losing streak. However, the squad’s shortage of play-ers — a problem that has hindered the team’s performance all season — pre-vented any such renaissance, and the Tritons finished the year on a sour note 
with a 0-6 overall record.
Heading into the season’s closing 
stages, head coach Will Burson faced 
a player-selection crisis, thanks to an already undersized, injury-ridden ros-ter. The Triton midfield and attack were without anchor players senior

SOFTBALL — Since only the top three teams in the league advance to the California Collegiate Athletic Association playoffs, No. 4 UCSD — tied with Humboldt State University in league standings — needed a four-game sweep in the regular-season series finale against Cal State San Bernardino from April 24 to April 25 in order to retain any hopes of postseason play.
Unfortunately, a series split against the Coyotes 
cost UCSD a spot in the CCAA playoffs, and jeop-ardized their chances at qualifying for this year’s National Collegiate Athletic Association Division-II Championships. However, the Tritons are still in contention to play at nationals if they end the season ranked in the top eight teams in the Western region of Division-II.
In the first game of Saturday’s doubleheader, the 
Tritons intimidated the Coyotes early on by plating two runs by the second inning — thanks to freshman third baseman Katie Belanger’s base-clearing home run to center field. 
The Tritons maintained momentum by tacking 
on three more runs by the sixth inning, one of which was junior outfielder Kris Lesovsky’s seventh of the season.
With sophomore right-hander Camille Gaito at the mound, the Coyotes struggled at the plate. Gaito singlehandedly pitched UCSD to a 5-1 victory, throwing a complete game and allowing the Coyotes only one run in the second inning. 
The second game on Friday brought the Tritons 
back down. Gaito was only able to pitch one inning, tired after withstanding seven innings in the game prior. As a result, San Bernardino came to life for six runs against both Triton relief pitchers — junior Brittany Sheats and senior Christine Zankich — who allowed three runs each.
UCSD needed a quick rebuttal of runs quickly if 
they were to mount any rally against Coyote pitch-ing. The team did manage to put a run on the board in the top of the fifth inning — courtesy of a well-struck home run over the left-field fence by junior transfer Rhiannon Ousley, her first as a Triton — but it was not enough.
“We came out excited, ” Ousley said. “I did my 
best to help my team out” . 
Despite recording three runs in the final inning, 
the Triton comeback efforts were in vain, and they walked away from the doubleheader with a 7-4 loss.
Junior infielder Jennifer DeFazio said the team’s 
inability to rally in the second game was in no way from lack of effort.
“We didn’t get the outcome we wanted, ” DeFazio TRITON BID FOR CONFERENCE PLAYOFF FALLS SHORT
