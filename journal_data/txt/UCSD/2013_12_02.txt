Bomb Threat Shuts Down I-15  6+/))H7-,0
Cars were stuck in traffic for two hours after a motorist’s brother jokingly 
claimed her vehicle was rigged with a bomb on Thanksgiving Day.
A bomb hoax between a brother and sister shut down the 
Interstate Highway 15 in both directions on /T_hanksgiving 
Day, causing tra ﬃc jams for two hours in the a /f_ternoon. 
According to the California Highway Patrol, a woman 
called 911 around 2:45 p.m., claiming she had received a 
phone call from a number she didn’t recognize telling her 
there was a bomb in her car.
CHP shut down the freeway in both directions, diverting incoming northbound tra ﬃc to Sate Route 52 and south -
bound tra ﬃc to Miramar Way. Holiday drivers stuck on the 
northbound I-15 began using the shoulder to turn their cars 
around and drive backwards on the freeway in order to reach 
the nearest exit, or the divide to the southbound I-15.

UCSD professor Mario Molina 
was awarded the Presidential Medal 
of Freedom award — the nation’s most 
prestigious civilian award — from 
President Barack Obama in a ceremo -
ny held on Wednesday, Nov. 20. The 
ceremony also honored 15 other recip -
ients of the award, including Oprah 
Winfrey and the late Sally Ride who 
was the first American woman in space 
before becoming a professor emeritus 
of physics at UCSD.
The Presidential Medal of Freedom 
award was established 50 years ago 
by the late President John F . Kennedy 
to honor men and women in their 
fields of expertise. Before honoring 
each recipient for their contributions, President Obama reminded those in 
attendance of the significance of the 
award.
“The Presidential Medal of 
Freedom goes to men and women 
who have dedicated their own lives 
to enriching ours, ” Obama said. “This 
year’s honorees have been blessed with 
extraordinary talent, but what sets 
them apart is their gift for sharing that 
talent with the world. ”
Molina was recognized by President 
Obama for his groundbreaking discov -
ery of chlorofluorocarbons, a common 
class of chemicals once found in aero -
sol sprays and refrigerants that deplete 
the ozone layer in the stratosphere. His 
work also earned him a Nobel Prize

Brain Scanning Technique6I7-/I-))+/H))1-I8/0B0,2
Surgeons at the UCSD Health 
System are now using a revolutionary 
scanning technique to see the human 
brain’s nerve connections before per -
forming critical surgery. 
This non-invasive method is called 
tractography, or diffusion tensor 
imaging. First introduced in 1985, it 
has mainly been used for investigating 
strokes and other neurological diseas -
es, like Alzheimer’s disease or autism, 
because it accurately maps out micro -
scopic details in brain tissue. 
UCSD Health System neurosur -
geons are now among the first to use 
DTI to scan the anatomy of white tissue affected by cancer, allowing 
them to perform delicate operations 
on brain tumors without adversely 
affecting critical functions like sight 
and speech. Instead of dyes, chemicals 
or needles, the technique simply uses 
water. By tracking the movement of 
water molecules in the brain, neuro -
surgeons can find important nerve 
endings and plan out their surgery 
accordingly. 
“There are no margins for error in 
the brain. Every centimeter of brain 
tissue contains millions of neural con -
nections, so every millimeter counts, ” 
Dr. Clark Chen, vice-chairman of 
neurosurgery at the UCSD Health 
System, said in a Nov. 21 news release. 
“With tractography, we can visualize 
the most important of these connec -
tions to avoid injury. /uni00A0In doing so, we 
will preserve the quality of life for our 
patients with brain cancer. ”The UCSD Health 
System will use the 
revolutionary method to 
visualize human nerves.

patients with tumors in parts of the 
brain that control memory and other 
key senses. They no longer have to 
worry about potentially damaging 
these functions because DTI scans 
reveal small paths to tumors between 
neurons and color code them, giving 
surgeons a clear idea of how to pro -
ceed with the operation. The technol -
ogy allowed Anthony Chetti, a San Diego teacher, to undergo surgery in 
his occipital lobe without suffering any

Current scanning technology, like 
computed tomography, cannot match 
the level of detail that DTI offers.

Medical Need for Organ Donations Should Be 
Prioritized Over Altruistic ConcernsOrgan Donor Compensation Does Not  
Diminish the Value of  a Saved Life   Ascribing Monetary Values to Organs Leads to 
Exploitation and Potential Health Risks
Every year, thousands of people sign up for an organ trans -
plant waiting list, and every year, thousands of people die without 
ever getting the desired organ. Though compensating organ 
donors has been a controversial issue, giving donors extra benefits 
for their organs will save many lives. 
Though compensating donors may appear to lessen the altru -
istic aspect of the donating process, the thousands of wait-list 
deaths accentuate the need for organs. According to the Organ 
Procurement and Transplantation Network, there are more than 
98,000 people on the waiting list for kidneys yet only 13,040 
people donated kidneys last year. In 2012, more than 4,500 people 
died last year waiting for a kidney. The current amount of organs 
donated is not enough; the government needs to recognize this 
and consider alternatives to increase donations.
By offering incentives, such as compensation for health costs, 
tax relief or a deduction on life and health insurance, the number 
of donors may increase since donors currently receive no other 
benefit than personal satisfaction. University of Calgary profes -
sor Dr. Braden Manns conducted a study this past October that 
showed that there would be a 5 percent increase in kidney dona -
tions if donors were offered a $10,000 payment. 
Although receiving compensation for organ donation may 
seem dehumanizing, the number of deaths will only increase as 
the waiting list grows. In the end, saving human lives should be 
made a top priority. Compensation does not lessen the altruistic 
value of organ donation, but simply gives more people reason to 
perform a good deed. 
— SHARON LAY
Staff WriterDespite the controversy surrounding it, the ethics of compen -
sating organ donors remains unclear. One side of the argument 
contends that the spirit of giving is lost when there’s a price tag 
on it, while others believe that giving organs a monetary value 
dehumanizes the human body. However, an individual’s decision 
to receive compensation or not for their organs should be their 
own choice.
Sperm and egg donors currently receive compensation, so 
there is not any particular reason why individuals should not 
receive a financial incentive for donating organs. While the prob -
lem of organ trafficking will continue to be an issue, the urgency 
of the donation process is more important. Organ donation will 
not be the only risk-laden medical procedure to be carried out; 
gamete donation, for example, remains a profitable business 
despite the concomitant concerns over health implications. 
According to Dr. Mark J. Perry of the American Enterprise 
Institute, as of 2012, fewer than 20 percent of patients awaiting 
kidney transplants were actually able to receive the operation. 
Without any sort of financial motive for prospective donors 
to give an organ, patients seeking new organs are reliant on 
donors to go under the knife out of the goodness of their hearts. 
Compensating organ donors could potentially relieve the short -
age, because it would do so by creating a real incentive to donate. 
Health care isn’t just about healing patients. There is a side of 
the medical sector that relies on moneymaking abilities, so com -
pensating an organ donor wouldn’t necessarily compromise the 
ethical considerations of a hospital. 
— SHANNON  KANG
Staff WriterCompensation for organ donors might seem like a viable 
option for medical institutions, but it is simply a short-term solu -
tion that would dehumanize one’s body to a market-valued prop -
erty and fuel-class inequality.
In a recent issue of the New Internationalist Magazine, 
Professor Jeremy Chapman, Director of Renal Services at 
Westmead Hospital in Australia, warned that the compensation 
plan could cause the poor and the vulnerable to sell their organs 
because of financial needs. This will allow the wealthy the luxury 
of “buying” organs, while the poor are the organs’ source. 
There are also potential health issues associated with incen -
tivizing donation. Dr. Arthur Caplan of New Y ork University 
Langone Medical Center suggests that the quality of organs could 
be threatened since donors tend to lie about their health status 
when monetary incentives are introduced. The risk of passing on 
infectious diseases through organ trade is especially unpredictable 
and perilous. Studies have yet to discover the long-term health 
impacts on both donors and beneficiaries, and legalizing organ 
trade could disrupt insurance policies, health regulations and 
healthcare plans. Compensation for organ donors risks the health 
of both the donors and the receiving patients.
The idea of giving monetary compensation for one’s body 
parts turns people into commodities, increases health risks and 
exacerbates class inequality. Although there are natural societal 
divides in income and property ownership, the human body is 
off-limits. Wealth should not determine who must donate organs 
or who is able to receive them.

Contributing WriterNowadays, students looking to be competitive in the job market after 
college must, not only be qualified, but also conscious of the image 
they present on social media platforms. Companies have been utiliz -
ing social media both to recruit and filter out potential candidates — a method 
that, despite its convenience and originality, has numerous disadvantages and 
shortcomings. Social media as a form of recruitment further eradicates face-to-
face communication, invades the boundary between personal and professional 
life and is overly trusting of the personas that individuals choose to project on 
Internet profiles.
According to the Jobvite Social Recruiting Survey, 92 percent of employers 
either currently use or plan to use social media as a recruiting tactic. Likeable 
Media, a New Y ork marketing firm, gives potential hires the option to follow up 
through both Twitter and Snapchat, claiming that it demonstrates their ability 
to get a message across no matter what the platform is. While this process may 
seem innovative and appropriate in a business world of growing speeds, one must 
reflect on society’s dangerously expanding use of telecommunication. 
Many businesses are now corresponding primarily through emails, text 
messages, websites or other technology-enabled media, leading to a decline in 
physical interactivity. Society has become consumed with online networking and 
enthralled by its shortcuts in sidestepping, tangible interaction. A UCLA study 
showed that “forgoing in-person meetings with clients can lead to misdirection 
and ultimately one or more parties being unsatisfied. ” 
The study also comments that “up to 93 percent of all communication is 
nonverbal. This includes eye contact, body language and posture, ” indicating that 
when we correspond on social networking sites, meaning is lost in transition. Due 
to its impersonal nature, recruitment through social media disallows candidates 
from making a first impression, never mind a lasting one; without intimate cor -
respondence, employers have a difficult time differentiating one person from the 
next. In-person interviews provide a more genuine representation of the indi -
vidual and their abilities, whereas telecommunication allows them to construe an 
intelligent response.
Reviewing and assessing candidate profiles creates the potential for bias in 
the hiring process, not to mention excluding members of the public who do not 
utilize social media. Recruiters claim that by delving into social channels, they 
can make more informed hiring decisions; however, a study at Carnegie Mellon 
University revealed that much of the content being explored by these employers 
was indicative of religion, race, sexual orientation, family status or other personal 
information. Asking personally relevant questions during an interview violates 
federal laws prohibiting job discrimination, and thus companies “who screen their 
candidates on social media run the risk of discovering information they’re not 
See HIRING , page 5allowed to have. ” If such information 
is off-limits, employers should not be 
able to seek it underhandedly online; 
introducing personal information in a 
professional setting deviates from the 
non-discriminatory policies that every 
establishment should practice.
Professional recruiters should 
limit their span of media outreach to 
professional networking platforms 
in order to maintain the division 
between career and private life. 
Platforms such as Linkedin, Biznik, 
and Ecademy provide a starting 
point for recruiters to identify their 
candidates based on concrete skills 
and experience and supplement the 
interview process rather than replace it. Websites dedicated to business net -
working allow users to connect in a 
professional context with a profile that 
details their qualifications. Through 
these websites, users can regulate the 
information they share with recruiters, 
rather than openly share their reli -
gious views, photos from a weekend 
in Vegas or political tweets that would 
be available on other sites. 
Outlets such as Facebook, Twitter, 
Snapchat and Instagram should be 
strictly social and have no business 
being employed as recruitment tools; 
one should not have to censor their 
identity on social media to guard 
against the snooping eye of employers. 
Such probing is an intrusion of private 
life and the personal uses for which 
the profile was created.Social hiring enables the misuse of 
personal information, creates potential 
for inauthenticity and perpetuates 
the ever increasing dependency on 
technology as a means of communica -
tion. The creation and nourishment of 
professional relationships becomes dif -
ficult without face-to-face-interaction 
on a frequent basis. Moreover, media 
sites made for personal use should stay 
limited to personal use so as to prevent 
discrimination in the recruitment 
process. While the emergence of social 
hiring clearly illustrates an advancing 
society, interpersonal dealings and 
quality relations should not be sabo -
taged for the purpose of expediency.!"#$#!$  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , D ECEMBER 2, 2013 | WWW. UCSDGUARDIAN .ORG %

Dear Editor,
UniversityLink at UCSD will 
replace — next year — the Transfer 
Admission Guarantee program that 
was discontinued in 2012. To be 
eligible for the program, a student’s 
family income cannot exceed $40,000 
a year. Additionally, students must 
have at least a 3.5 average GPA, and 
they must fulfill regular transfer 
requirements. Students must also go 
to one of nine local partner commu -
nity colleges: Cuyamaca, Grossmont, 
Imperial Valley, MiraCosta, Palomar, 
San Diego City, San Diego Mesa, San 
Diego Miramar or Southwestern. 
Interim Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Alan Houston at the most 
recent UCSD A.S. Council meeting, 
said that an estimated 200 students 
will be eligible for the program each 
year and that there is no ceiling for 
the number of students that can take 
advantage of it. A potential financial 
problem that this program may cause 
is that these incoming students will 
require larger amounts of financial 
aid. However, according to Houston, 
Chancellor Pradeep Khosla’s “primary 
objective in the capital campaign that 
will be launched next year is scholar -
ships for undergraduate students. ” 
In my opinion, the new “guaran -
teed” transfer policy facilitates racket -
ing up graduate enrollment at UCSD 
while it potentially creates a big hole 
in undergraduate enrollment that 
wasn’t there before (under TAG). 
This is in keeping with UCSD 
Chancellor Pradeep Khosla’s long-
term goals. Establishing a free 
standing school is bound to limit its 
impact on the overall educational 
system, and such a school is likely to 
have to provide resources that could 
be garnered from existing schools or 
at least could be used in cooperation with such schools. Even if the school 
is not connected to other schools, it 
would make sense to have some sort 
of regularized internship connec -
tions, which would link the students 
and staff to the realities of computer 
operations in various government 
and private organizations in the 
country, e.g., like the berufsacademie 
in Germany.
California’s master plan for higher 
education has succeeded in build -
ing the greatest system in the world, 
but it’s under attack. Push has come 
to shove with the $200 per unit 
charges for Santa Monica Community 
College’s most in-demand classes. 
San Diego Community College 
District Chancellor Constance Carroll 
and State Senator Marty Block now 
want baccalaureate degrees in the 
fields of nursing, software engineer -
ing and public safety administration. 
San Diego State University might raise 
tuition independently, and establish 
Ph.D.s, M.D.s and J.D.s (if the Block-
Carroll heresy isn’t snuffed). 
Dick Blum, the longest-serving 
member on the UC board, is there 
to exploit the privatization of the 
112-member, 2-year public college 
system; he owns $700 million in for-
profit colleges stock (Blum told me on 
the sidelines of the regents meeting 
held in San Diego: “The CCs aren’t 
doing their jobs”). 
For-profit colleges are mined by 
their CEOs overwhelmingly at tax -
payer expense. Senator Marty Block 
is for EVERYTHING. He takes the 
maximum amount of money from 
Bridgepoint Education Corporation. 
He favors the local option for SDSU.  
Block supports Point Loma 
Nazarene University and University of 
San Diego students receiving the same 
amount of money in Cal Grants as do 
Stanford University students.

On the spectrum of sexu -
ality between “straight” 
and “gay, ” asexuality is 
one shade that often goes 
unrecognized — but one 
UCSD student has a plan 
to change that. Amy, who 
asked to remain anony -
mous, aims to bring more visibility and support to 
the asexual community, primarily through opening a 
chapter of the Asexual Visibility & Education Network, 
or AVEN, at UCSD.
“ Asexual” refers to a person who does not experi -
ence sexual attraction, according to www.asexuality.
org. The website differentiates asexuality from celi -
bacy, saying that while celibacy is a choice, asexuality 
is an inherent characteristic of the individual, like any 
other sexuality. Sexuality also differs from romantic 
orientation, as one’s romantic orientation may allow 
him or her to desire a long-term, intimate relationship 
with someone without feeling sexual attraction to that 
person. Therefore, an asexual may still experience 
romantic feelings.
Since asexuality has historically been swept under 
the rug, Amy is currently working to bridge that gap 
in knowledge and support in order to acknowledge 
asexuality as a legitimate sexual orientation. Her first 
step is to open up an AVEN chapter at UCSD, which 
will function like any other student organization. 
This chapter will both help educate others about 
asexuality and provide a source of support for other 
asexuals on campus.
AVEN was founded in 2001 by American asex -
ual activist David Jay and since then, has inspired a 
strengthened online asexual community. This has 
paved the way for asexuals to more openly discuss rel -
evant problems and experiences in forums on websites, 
such as www.experienceproject.com and www.asexu -
alityorg.proboards.com. Asexual student groups exist 
at various universities in the U.S. and England, includ -
ing UC Berkeley, UC Davis, Princeton University, 
University of Colorado at Boulder and University 
See ASEXUAL , page 7
PHOTOS COURTESY OF IMMANUEL BRANDEMO / FLICKRCollege London. Amy plans to form 
a physical group similar to these for 
UCSD asexuals and supporters. 
Amy describes her experience 
as an asexual in high school to be 
lonely and difficult, but since com -
ing to college, she says her situation 
has improved.
“I have met and become close 
friends with other asexuals, which 
has reduced the loneliness signifi -
cantly, ” she said. “Finding someone 
else who is just like you in a some -
times hostile world is the best feel -
ing in existence. Many people know 
what asexuality is 
on this campus, 
and I’ve found out 
the medical pro -
viders at UCSD do 
not discriminate 
against asexuals. ”
Despite the 
improvement Amy 
has felt in college, 
she and others 
continue to face 
obstacles in gain -
ing recognition. 
Amy mentioned 
one asexual friend 
who was told by 
her mentor that 
her sexual identity made her unfit 
to be a mother. Another friend was 
almost raped because her significant 
other “thought he could change her. ” 
Yet another friend is afraid to tell 
his medical providers he is asexual, 
fearing that he will be subjected to 
unnecessary and damaging proce -
dures, such as sex therapy.
Amy noted that many treat asex -
uality as a condition that needs to be 
treated or repaired.
“Many claim that ‘I have just not 
found the right man, ’ ‘I just need to 
try it, and I’ll change, ’ and that ‘I can -
not love someone without wanting 
sex, ’” Amy said. “I deal with obnox -ious questions with a cheeky, witty 
response, because it is always better 
to be funny and witty than angry 
and upset. For example, whenever 
people say, ‘You can’t love someone 
without wanting sex, ’ I sarcastically 
speculate about their activities with 
their pets. ”
While Amy is comfortable with 
her asexual identity at school, a gen -
eral lack of acceptance toward asexu -
ality has made it difficult for her to 
come out to others, like her family.
“Today, I wanted to do an inter -
view where my name was known, ” 
Amy said. “But because my family 
gets the school newspaper, I could 
not — not without say -
ing to my family what 
eventually needs to be 
said. I am 100 percent 
out at school, which is 
why I can start a club 
and speak on panels, 
but at home, it is a com -
pletely different story. ”
Because of a risk 
that her family will 
not support her, Amy 
has chosen to remain 
anonymous — but that 
lack of support is what 
has motivated her to 
spread awareness. 
“No one should 
ever have to hide who they are, for 
any reason, ” Amy said. “Everyone 
deserves to grow up in a world 
that will not trivialize, belittle or 
threaten them for who they are, be 
that because of their race, gender, 
sexual orientation, gender identity 
or some other factor. I want to be an 
architect in creating that world for 
my friends, my family, myself and 
my children. I would have to be hor -
ribly naive to believe that starting a 
chapter would solve everything, but 
it’s a good place to start. ”FEA TURES  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , DECEMBER 2, 2013 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  7

The Breakthrough of  Students Against Mass Incarceration
A new organization on campus seeks to raise awareness of the institutionalized racism of the U.S. prison system with a poster art exhibition.
The United States of America is 
a prison nation. According to the 
Center for the Study of Political 
Graphics, even though the U.S. 
holds only 5 percent of the world’s 
population, it houses 25 percent of 
the world’s prisoners — the larg -
est percentage in any region. This 
percentage has quadrupled between 
2008 and 2011 alone, a span of 
a mere three years. The statistics 
suggest that mass incarceration is 
an unnoticed real -
ity in the U.S. today, 
which compelled 
Revelle College 
junior Eunice Ho to 
establish a new orga -
nization on campus 
this quarter called 
Students Against 
Mass Incarceration.
SAMI is dedicated 
to spreading aware -
ness at UCSD about 
the prison system 
as a form of institu -
tionalized racism. In 
November, the club 
seized the oppor -
tunity to display 
the “Prison Nation: 
Posters on the Prison 
Industrial Complex” 
art exhibition from 
the archives of the 
Center for Study of 
Political Graphics. 
The entire collection 
of posters was cre -
ated by artists, activ -
ists and organizations around the 
world who aim to speak out against 
mass incarceration. Currently, 75 
posters are on display — 25 in the 
Cross-Cultural Center and 50 in the 
West Wing of Geisel Library on the 
second floor. The pieces will be on 
display until January.
The exhibit features powerful 
images that may force viewers to 
reevaluate their perceptions of the 
prison system. For instance, one 
poster depicts the U.S. flag with pris -on bars for stripes and lock holes for 
stars, emphasizing how prisons have 
become such an integral yet unno -
ticed part of the nation. Another 
poster equates prisons to slavery, 
juxtaposing a bird’s eye perspective 
of a prison and that of a slave ship.
“The goal [of the exhibit] is to 
challenge the way people at UCSD 
think about the prison system and 
to bring awareness, ” Ho said. “ A 
large aspect of this is through the 
provocatory aspect of those pieces 
— not because they are exaggerated, 
but because they bring focus to 
issues in the dark. ”
“Prison Nation” explores the 
various facets of the prison system, 
including the treatment of women 
prisoners and political prisoners 
and the controversial laws of the 
system, such as the Three Strikes 
Law in California and the Stop and 
Frisk Law in New York. As defined 
by Stanford Law School, the Three 
Strikes Law condemns a life sen -
tence for nearly any crime, regard -
less of its level of severity, if the 
defendant has a criminal record of two previous convictions that the 
California Penal Code deemed as 
serious or violent. The Stop and 
Frisk Law allows officers to stop, 
question and frisk people at random 
to check for weapons and illicit 
substances.
The part of the exhibit that 
personally touches Ho the most 
is a display in the Cross-Cultural 
Center with the following quote 
by American union leader Eugene 
Debs: “While there is a lower class 
I am in it, while there is a criminal 
element I am of it, and while there is 
a soul in prison I am not free. ”
Ho has felt similar emotions regard -
ing the Prison Industrial Complex. 
There is a disproportionate percentage 
of black and Latino prisoners on a 
national level; according to the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons, 37 percent of federal 
prison inmates are black, and 34.9 per -
cent are Latino. In addition, numerous 
companies, including big names like 
Starbucks and Microsoft, invest in cor -
porations that exploit prison labor at 
rates as low as 93 cents a day, according 
to the Prison Policy Initiative.“I became enraged about this 
injustice, which is so relevant but 
not widely covered enough, ” Ho said. 
“ And yet we don’t know about it, and 
we spend our tax money putting 
people in prison. I couldn’t continue 
my undergrad years with a clean 
conscience without doing anything 
about it. ”
SAMI is the result of this drive to 
promote awareness. Ho even plans 
to issue a divestment bill campaign 
during winter quarter to be passed 
by the A.S. Council. Such a bill 
would work as a filter to prevent 
council from investing in any com -
panies that use 
prison labor, there -
by fighting against 
the PIC. UC 
Berkeley and UC 
Santa Barbara have 
already passed 
similar bills. Ho 
hopes that UCSD 
will be the third 
UC campus to fol -
low suit.
Ho plans to 
continue to raise 
awareness about 
the injustices of 
the prison sys -
tem throughout 
the school year 
and even after she 
graduates, as she 
says that SAMI’s 
fight is her own 
personal fight. In 
fact, her passion 
for the cause was 
what led to her 
shift from a physi -
ology and neuro -
science major to an ethnic studies 
and sociology double major during 
her sophomore year.
“People are supportive of [my 
cause], ” Ho said. “They know that 
I know the direction I’m going 
towards and that I’m not doing this 
haphazardly. My shift [in majors] 
served as a catalyst among friends to 
engage in this issue. ”BY  sou my a  ku rn oo l

did manage to find a picture online of 
the exact bed. The bed comes with the 
bed slats pictured and with this ikea 
memory foam mattress. The mattress 
is about 2 years old and came from a 
home with no pets or smokers. The bed 
frame is still in excellent shape and has 
all of the hardware except for 2 of the 
mini dowels that hold the bed slats in 
place that for some reason didn’t come 
with it. You can get these at ikea pretty 
cheap, but I found that I didn’t really 
need them as the slats don’t really have 
anywhere to go in the twin frame any -
way. It’s really light and breaks down so 
it’s relatively easy to move. I was able to

GOVERNANCE OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN MEXICO – UC SAN 
DIEGO, INSTITUTE OF THE AMERICAS, DEUTZ ROOM
In this public talk, Diaz-Cayeros will discuss Mexico's massive 
transformation of both its political system and its public health 
system over the last twenty-five years. The simultaneous changes 
in Mexico provide scholars with the opportunity to undertake 
ground-breaking research to understand how democratization and 
public health intersect. This research can inform policy decisions 
and directly impact improved health outcomes in Mexico and 
around the world. Dr. Alberto Diaz-Cayeros joined the Freeman

#MoreThanAShirtJunior goalkeeper Cameron 
Ravanbach contributed 16 saves to 
the defensive effort, while the Triton 
offense was led by sophomore utility 
Chase Cockerill and junior driver 
David Higginson, who scored two 
goals apiece. 
The win comes a year after 
UCSD was defeated by UC Davis at 
the WWPA championship.
“When we lost last year, it was 
difficult, ” Cockerill recalled. “We all 
remembered that feeling and we did 
everything we could to not let that 
happen again. ”To advance to the championship 
match, the Tritons beat No. 14 Santa 
Clara 8–4. The match featured a 
career-high 21 saves by Ravanbach 
and tied the school record for saves. 
Ravanbach — the All-California 
Collegiate Athletic Association first 
team selection — was awarded the 
most valuable player in the tournament 
for his 37 saves across the two games.
Teammates Higginson and 
junior two-meter defense Tommy 
Friedrich also earned All-CCAA 
first team honors, while junior 
utility Joe Dietrich made the all-
tournament second team.
UCSD can now look forward to the NCAA tournament. This 
Thursday, Dec. 5, the Tritons will face 
Saint Francis University — the Central 
Water Polo Association Champions. 
The Tritons’ next match will be 
against Saint Francis (22–10 overall, 
9–2 in conference), Thursday, Dec. 
5 in the first round of the NCAA 
tournament. Based in Brooklyn 
Heights, New York, Saint Francis, 
which made a Final Four appearance 
last season, was also this season’s 
Collegiate Water Polo Association 
conference champion.Water Polo Will Head to NCAA T ournament This Thursday

'()*++,-(./++++ +%*)!,-.'%$/"$0Alwafai Breaks Course Record at NCAAs
Senior McCutchan Named to the All-CCAA Second TeamChico State, who dominated the field 
during the CCAA and West Regionals 
meets, finished sixth overall with a 
score of 242. UCSD’s other conference 
rival, Cal Poly Pomona, finished eighth 
with a score of 304.
Individually, junior Tabor 
Stevens of Adams State took the 
national championship, finishing 
the 10 km race in 29:50.1, 11 sec -
onds ahead of second place finisher 
Vegard Olstad of Western State.
Isaac Chavez of Chico State, fin -
ished eighth overall in the final 
meet of his collegiate cross-country 
career. Chavez finished with a time 
of 30:30.1 and was the first CCAA 
runner to cross the finish line.
Chavez’s teammates Johnny 
Sanchez and Alfonso Cisneros fin -
ished 23rd and 45th respectively, 
putting up competitive times and 
helping Chico State finish so high.
Alwafai finished in 100th place 
with his UCSD course record setting 
time of 32:15.2, placing ahead of San 
Francisco State individual runner 
Bruk Assefa. 
“The most important takeaway 
from today is the experience Tareq 
gained at the national level, ” UCSD 
head coach Garcia said to the UCSD 
Athletics Department. “This will be a 
huge benefit to him moving forward. ”On the women’s side, Grand Valley 
State won the championship with 54 
points followed by Adams State with 
91. The Chico State women, like the 
men, finished in sixth with a score 
of 242.
Jennifer Agnew, an individual 
runner from the University of Mary, 
won the six-kilometer race with a 
time of 20:50.7. Ayla Granados of 
Chico State crossed the line in 26th 
place with a time of 21:39.9.
The national meet, besides giving 
Alwafai invaluable experience at the 
highest level of competition, showed 
that Tritons, whether on their own or 
as a group, can compete with the top 
teams in the nation. 
“Next year it should be easier 
to make it to nationals as a team, ” 
Alwafai said. 
In 2014, the top six teams at the 
NCAA West Regionals will qualify 
for nationals, instead of the top five, 
as with this season. UCSD earned 
sixth place at this season’s NCAA 
West Regionals.
Despite losing valuable assets on 
both the men’s and women’s teams 
— including All-CCAA runners 
Matt Lenehan and Kellen Levy — all 
four All-West runners return for the 
next year, ready for another season.

team hit .234. The next night, 
McCutchan set a season-high mark for 
kills with 17 and hit .361.
“Perfection is just reflective of the 
number, ” McCutchan said. “It wasn’t 
a ‘perfect’ game. I never know exactly 
what I’m hitting, but you kind of have 
an idea, you know, whether I’m hot or 
not. I was just trying to help the team 
by playing well. ”
The Tritons have had a very suc -
cessful regular season, amassing a 25–5 
record that includes a 17–5 conference 
record. At one point during the year, 
the UCSD women’s volleyball team 
went on a nine-game winning streak.
“I feel so proud of what we’ve 
accomplished this season, ” McCutchan 
said. “We’ve just stepped up our 
game and everyone had to take more 
responsibility and be more account -
able because we’ve had less people, 
fewer starters. ”
“Fewer starters” is a reference to 
the roster shake-up that took place 
just as the season began, when sopho -
more starter Amber Hawthorne left 
the squad. Sophomore Heidi Sierks was forced to step into the role, and 
the team grew closer as a whole in the 
wake of it all.
“It says a lot about the girls that I 
play with, just our resilience, and it 
says a lot about our coaches and their 
decision making, ” McCutchan said. 
“I’m happy with the way things have 
turned out, because it could have been 
a lot different. For other programs [the 
loss of a starter] could have been a lot 
more debilitating. ”
McCutchan is a senior from 
Eleanor Roosevelt College pursuing 
a degree in cognitive science, though 
the middle blocker has junior stand -
ing after redshirting her first year 
on the team. She has a background 
in both volleyball and basketball, 
though she pursued basketball before 
trying volleyball.
McCutchan’s decision to play vol -
leyball was quite the good fortune for 
Head Coach Ricci Luyties, who took 
over the program after her first year 
at UCSD.
“Ricci didn’t recruit me, it was the 
coach before him that left and went to 
[Loyola Marymount] after that sea -
son, ” McCutchan said. “It was just a happy chance that I get along with my 
coach so much and he’s such an awe -
some guy, because it wasn’t my plan. ”
On Wednesday, Nov. 27, 
McCutchan was named to the All-
CCAA second team. This season, 
she leads the Tritons in hitting per -
centage, while ranked fourth in the 
conference and 19th in the nation. 
McCutchan is second on the team in 
points, and she ranks third in both 
kills and blocks.
McCutchan hopes that the jour -
ney for UCSD doesn’t end too soon, 
with playoffs set to begin.
“ As the season has gone on, my 
goals have molded to where we are, ” 
McCutchan said. “I really think we 
can win the regional tournament. 
It would be unbelievable to go to 
Nationals. From there, I’ d make new 
goals, but we have to get there first. ”
The Tritons begin their quest for 
an NCAA Division II title Thursday, 
Dec. 5, against Dixie State at Cal State 
San Bernardino when the NCAA 
West Regional gets underway.

The UCSD men’s water polo team claimed its 16th 
Western Water Polo Association championship at the 
annual tournament Nov. 23 to Nov. 24. 
The Tritons began the tournament with a win against 
the University of Santa Clara to advance to the championship 
game against hosts No. 1 seeded UC Davis. On Sunday, Nov. 
24, UCSD upset the Aggies 6–4 in the championship bout. 
Defeating the Aggies qualified UCSD (14–12 overall) for the 
NCAA National Championship hosted by Stanford University 
Dec. 7 to Dec. 8. 
“This is really special, ” UCSD head coach Denny Harper 
said. “Coming out on top against a very good Davis 
team, and to do it here in Davis obviously makes it 
very special for everybody. ”
Going into the match, the Tritons were 
wary of containing the Aggies’ Bernie Rogers 
— a Del Mar native who has 47 goals and 32 
assists this season. But junior two-meter Matt 
Michalko effectively controlled Rogers while 
the Triton defense held the Aggies to 4–32 
shooting overall.
“I think it was a masterful game plan on 
the defensive end, ” Harper said. “The kids 
swam hard, and I think Matt Michalko did a 
phenomenal job on Bernie Rogers. ”

WEEKEND RESULTS
OTUCSD runner Tareq Alwafai rep -
resented the Tritons at the NCAA 
national cross-country meet on Nov. 
23, breaking the UCSD course record 
— which Alwafai had set two weeks 
prior at the NCAA Regionals — and 
becoming the first Triton to attend 
the meet in five years.
Alwafai, a sophomore, qualified 
for nationals at the NCAA Division 
II West Regionals as an individual 
racer. His teammates were just shy of 
qualifying as a team.
“I was pretty nervous because it was a bigger meet, and I didn’t have 
my team, ” Alwafai said, “But I just 
had to look at it like any other race. ”
The top teams and runners in the 
country made appearances at the meet, 
which was composed of 32 Division II 
schools and 246 Division II runners. 
There were two California Collegiate 
Athletic Association conference teams 
in attendance — Chico State and Cal 
Poly Pomona — as well as individual 
runners from San Francisco State.
Adams State finished first overall 
with a score of 54, beating second 
place Grand V alley State by 50 points. Sara McCutchan becomes the sev -
enth player in Division II history to 
have a perfect hitting game, going 11 
for 11 with no errors.
UCSD middle blocker Sara 
McCutchan put herself on a very short 
list on Friday, Nov. 8, when she became 
just the seventh woman in NCAA 
Division II play to hit 1.000 in a game 
with a minimum of 10 attempts. It was 
the first time the feat had been reached 
since October 2011.
She not only became the first 
Triton to accomplish the feat, but McCutchan also became the first 
woman in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association to have a perfect 
hitting night.
“I didn’t really realize how big of 
a deal it was, ” McCutchan said. “That 
particular game I wasn’t sure until the 
last game when my coach was like, 
‘Set Sara, she hasn’t missed one yet. ’ I 
really wasn’t sure until the end. Once 
we got to the very end, he was careful 
not to have me go in at a weird time to 
disrupt it. ”

Soccer: A 
Tale of  Two 
Seasons
Markets, basketball franchises 
and the next majority party 
in the House are three things 
politicos, pundits and investment 
bankers all agree are subject to the 
power of “the cycle. ”
Pundits blame “the cycle” for the 
Lakers’ last three disappointing sea -
sons since the team won back-to-back 
rings in 2009 and 2010.
But for UCSD soccer, no such 
“cycle” exists. After a season when 
the men’s team made its first NCAA 
appearance in a decade and the 
women failed to qualify for the tour -
nament for the first time since UCSD 
moved to Division II, don’t expect this 
abrupt reversal of fortune to continue.
Here’s why.
For the men’s team, the recent 
upswing quite clearly correlates with 
the addition of UCSD head coach Jon 
Pascale to the Triton coaching staff. 
Pascale, a two-time CCAA Coach of 
the Y ear, has been at the helm for six 
seasons, and each year, the Tritons 
have inched closer to the postseason.
To the casual observer, the seasons 
preceding the team’s historic postsea -
son run would seem unremarkable. 
But in 2012, the Tritons were snubbed 
from a playoff appearance due to a 
technicality imposed at the begin -
ning of the season to make up for a 
Humboldt State team barred from 
the playoffs. And the season before, 
UCSD was just one game shy of a 
conference tournament berth. 
So, why were the men so suc -
cessful this season? Not to be reduc -
tive, but senior central midfielder 
Andisheh Bagheri’s explosive senior 
season and the addition of hard-
nosed junior transfer holding forward 
Alessandro Canale were two major 
ingredients. Bagheri scored just two 
goals in his first three seasons, but this 
year, he provided six game-winning 
goals. Canale enabled the Tritons 
to build up the attack and was also 
a much-needed target in the box, 
muscling his way around — and often 
through — defenders. 
This sudden offensive boom, 
coupled with a defense that featured 
top-notch senior goalkeeper Josh 
Cohen, was a recipe for success. The 
Tritons will graduate a good deal of 
this season’s squad, but without major 
regime changes, UCSD should see 
continued success. 
The women’s team, however, did 
not qualify for the conference tour -
nament, despite being the NCAA 
national runners-up in 2012, but 
there’s nothing to suggest that this 
season will mark the beginning of 
UCSD’s bear market.
UCSD graduated 10 Tritons in 
2013 — the core of the midfield and 
back line — but the coaches found 
gems in freshmen, forward Jamie 
Benedetto and outside backs Kylee 
Southwell and Kristen Sampietro.
But the UCSD women are also 
in good hands, under the leader -
ship of 27-season head coach Brian 
McManus, who has the seventh-
highest career-winning percentage in 
NCAA history.
McManus’s Tritons have never 
been subject to a multiple-season 
slump, and it’s unlikely that 2013 will 
begin a downward trend.
And I bet that the coaches from 
around the CCAA would agree. Ten 
bucks says in spite of this season’s 
results, next season, UCSD ranks in 
the top two of the conference’s annual 
Preseason Coaches’ Poll.
