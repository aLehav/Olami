UCSD’s Jacobs School of 
Engineering reported a record total 
enrollment of 8,923 students for the 
Fall Quarter 2015, according to The 
San Diego Union-Tribune.
The 49-percent increase of 
undergraduate engineering majors 
over the past 10 years has prompted 
more faculty employment for the 
Jacobs School as well as a growth in 
student engineering organizations.
Jacobs School of Engineering Dean 
Albert Pisano explained how the 
increased enrollment rates result in a 
disproportionate student-faculty ratio.
“Over the next five years, we 
would like to see a gradual decline in 
enrollment so that we can reduce the 
student-faculty ratio to 20-1, ” Pisano 
told The San Diego Union-Tribune. 
“Right now, it is 31-1. ” 
Nineteen new faculty members 
were employed in 2014 and another 
16 are set  to be hired this school year.
According to the Jacobs School, 
undergraduate enrollment dropped 
from 6,849 students in Fall Quarter 
2014 to 6,677 students in Fall Quarter 
2015. However, the number of 
master’s and doctoral students grew 
by 116 students.
Jacobs School representatives 
associated this annually consistent 
growth with an increased interest 
in solving problems using specific 
engineering methods.
“Many students want to use 
engineering and computer science 
majors as a way to help people, 
humanity and the world, ” The Jacobs 
School told the UCSD Guardian in a 
statement. “Engineering majors offer 
students the ability to gain problem-
solving skills, teamwork experience 
and technical expertise that empower 
them to address some of the most 
crucial issues facing humanity. ”
Specifically, computer science 
and engineering major enrollment 
increased most significantly at UCSD. 
Its ranking escalated from the sixth 
most popular major in 2004 to the 
third most popular in 2014 after 
biology and economics. The electrical 
and computer engineering major 
followed closely with an increase from 
seventh to fourth most popular.
UCSD’s official enrollment for 
the Fall Quarter 2015 also broke 
records at 33,735 students, of 
whom approximately 27 percent are 
engineering majors.
Triton Engineering Student 
Council President James Natanauan 
attributed the expansion to the recent 
growth in recognition of UCSD’s 
engineering school.
“The Jacobs name is more 
prestigious now, ” Natanauan told 
the Guardian. “We have participated VOLUME 49, ISSUE 13   THURSDA Y , NOVEMBER 5, 2015  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

The U.S. Department of 
Education released a resource guide 
designed to help undocumented 
students navigate the secondary and 
postsecondary school systems on 
Oct. 20. This resource guide aims 
to ensure that undocumented youth 
are on a path to success regardless of 
their immigration status.
Deputy Education Secretary 
John King commented in a press 
statement that despite the challenges 
that undocumented students face, 
educators are capable of providing help 
and supporting them.
“Our nation’s public schools should be welcoming, safe and supportive 
places where all students, regardless 
of their zip code or where they were 
born, are given the opportunity 
to succeed, ” King said. “We know 
undocumented youth face unique 
challenges, and we also know that 
educators and other caring adults in 
schools and colleges can play a major 
role in helping all students, including 
undocumented students, to achieve at 
the highest levels. ”
The guide includes specifics such as 
a summary of undocumented students’ 
rights, tips for educators on how to 
help undocumented students navigate 
the college admissions process, 
information on federal financial aid, 
scholarships for undocumented youth and information for students in the 
Migrant Education Program.
This guide has been praised by 
many as a step in the right direction 
when it comes to helping the nation’s 
undocumented students. Jessica 
Munoz, the Undocumented Student 
Services Coordinator at UCSD, 
explained the importance of the U.S. 
Department of Education reaching out 
to serve this demographic and why 
this resource guide is beneficial to both 
students and educators in a statement 
to the UCSD Guardian.
“It is helpful to see the U. S. 
Department of Education joining 
this important conversation and 
demonstrating a commitment to Board of  Regents Considers 
Redefining Anti-Semitism
The UC Board of Regents held an open forum 
at UCLA to discuss proposed changes to the 
University of California’s Statements of Principles 
Against Intolerance and to address anti-Semitic behavior on 
UC campuses on Oct. 26. 
The proposed policy changes seek to adopt the U.S. State 
Department’s definition of anti-Semitism regarding Israel 
when such speech demonizes, sets double-standards against  
and/or delegitimizes the nation. This can include speech 
that draws comparisons of Israeli policies to Nazi Germany 
or denies Israel’s right to exist among others.  
The proposed changes are a result of a petition submitted 
in May by twenty-three different organizations and over 500 
UC alumni to UC President Janet Napolitano calling for her 
to redefine anti-semitism,
The reasoning behind such policy changes comes at a 
time when some Jewish organizations say that the current 
policies against intolerance are not enough to address the 
spike in anti-Semitism across the UC system. For example, 
in February, vandals defaced a Jewish fraternity house at UC 
Davis with anti-Semitic graffiti and symbols. 
Zionist Organization of America’s West Coast campus 
coordinator Leore Ben David argued that the UC system needs to clearly define anti-Semitism if it hopes to combat 
the harassment of students. 
“On a UC administrative level, I think more can be 
done, ” David told the UCSD Guardian. “I think this is the 
exact way to do it by making a uniform statement about 
how anti-Semitism, specifically anti-Israel, demoralization, 
dehumanization and double-standardization are all not 
welcomed at the UC system. ” 
Supporters of the change claim that redefining anti-
Semitism will contribute to a more positive environment 
across UC campuses.
Assistant Vice President of Equity, Diversity and 
Inclusion Daniel Juarez said that many UC campuses 
do not do enough to include underrepresented 
communities. Thus, he believes, adopting the State 
Department’s definition will result in progress toward 
making the UC system more welcoming. 
“UC campuses across the state have continuously 
proven to foster a campus climate that is negative for 
underrepresented communities, ” Juarez said. “I do think 
that the UC [system] needs to make sure that it is centering 
[around] those communities that are least represented and 
most marginalized by the institution. Combating anti-  B Y  Andrew Chao    Staff WriterJacobs School

prospective students. ”
In response to the expansion of 
engineering interests, TESC supports 
25 member organizations including the Triton Rocket Club, which is 
working to be the first university 
team to send a rocket into space and 
the new Triton 3-D Printing Club, 
which hosted its first annual Make-
A-Thon competition this past May. 
Other organizations include the 
National Society of Black Engineers and Women in Computing. 
Natanauan added that the 
community of engineering students 
created at UCSD focuses on achieving 
success as a group.
“UCSD’s engineering program 
is different than other universities’ 
[programs], ” Natanauan said. “The Jacobs School is competitive, but when 
you look to your left and right, those 
are the people that are going to help 
you succeed, not the people you need 
to compete against. ”2 THE UCSD GUARDIAN | THURSDAY , NOVEMBER 5, 2015 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  NEW S

Sage Schubert Christian, Katie Potts, Christian DuarteUCSD launched the Microbiome 
and Microbial Sciences Initiative, a 
research program that will implement 
a multi-disciplinary approach to 
understanding microorganisms in 
order to benefit the environment and 
human health. The start of the program 
was announced by Chancellor Pradeep 
K. Khosla on Oct. 29. 
The initiative, which will be 
spearheaded by computer science and 
engineering Professor Rob Knight and 
biology Professor Kit Pogliano, will 
merge sciences, engineering, medicine 
and humanities together to improve 
the way microbes are studied.
Pogliano said the combination 
of the disciplines will allow the 
initiative to discern how to use 
microbes beneficially.
“The initiative will leverage our 
breadth in the quantitative microbial 
sciences and our collaborative culture 
to understand and ultimately control how these streamlined cells and their 
dynamic communities impact our 
health and the environment, ” Pogliano 
described in a press release on Oct. 29.
Microbiomes, as explained by 
Knight, are cells that are responsible 
for certain health conditions, such 
as obesity, autism and multiple 
sclerosis. More research needs to 
be done to uncover just how these 
microorganisms operate.
“Most of the microbes and their 
genes are unknown right now, ” Knight 
told the UCSD Guardian. “We’re trying 
to discover this ‘dark matter’ within 
our own body and use it both to cure 
disease and promote life-long health. ”
Until now, most microbiome 
studies have focused on mice. Knight 
believes that the initiative, with its 
new focused Center for Microbiome 
Innovation, can create the technology 
needed to study how microbiomes 
affect humans.
“Technology to read out our 
microbiomes has improved rapidly and 
has already told us a lot in a research setting, mainly in mice, ” Knight said. 
“To translate these findings into 
humans, we need better technology to 
read out and control our microbiomes. 
That’s what the Center will develop. ”
Biological Sciences Student 
Association President Christian 
Javier thinks that the initiative 
makes use of the university’s multi-
disciplinary potential.
“[The initiative is] important 
because it showcases what UCSD 
has to offer, which is the power to 
cross disciplinary borders so that we 
can approach subjects from more 
than one perspective, ” Javier told the 
Guardian. “We’re able to take the 
resources we have to create research 
that will help us understand our 
environment and ourselves. ”
Believing the initiative will benefit 
students in his organization, Javier 
plans to connect with the project leads 
to take advantage of this opportunity.
“ As BSA President, it’s great news 
for us because it could allow a lot 
of undergraduates to get involved in brand new research, ” Javier said. 
“My team will start facilitating 
communication between us and the 
heads of this project to see what we can 
do in terms of getting undergraduates 
on board. ”
Revelle College senior and 
microbiology major Bruno Perthus 
imagines that the initiative will be 
key to solving a variety of health 
problems and is enthusiastic about 
the widespread impact the university’s 
research will have.
“This research will help identify the 
effects [of different diseases], and by 
identifying the effects, they’ll be able to 
find a novel way to change that effect 
to better the human body, ” Perthus told 
the Guardian. “Knowing that research 
in this area will be discovered at UCSD 
makes me excited about what the 
school will offer to the world. ”
Knight said that students can get 
involved in this research by contacting 
himself or Kit Pogliano.SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

▶ ENGINEERING,  from page 1serving this often under-resourced 
group of students, ” Munoz said. 
“Resources like this guide can be an 
important tool, not only for students, 
but for the teachers and counselors 
who support them. Students benefit 
from written information, but they 
also benefit from caring, personalized 
support, which is what we aim to 
provide at the UCSD’s Undocumented Student Services Center. ”
In addition to providing resources 
for students and educators, the 
resource guide is expected to  to help 
students using the Deferred Action 
for Childhood Arrivals program. 
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration 
Services Director Leon Rodriguez 
expressed support for the resource 
guide because it could specifically aid 
DACA students.
“It’s been three years since we unveiled the Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrivals policy, or DACA, 
for those eligible young undocumented 
immigrants who were brought to the 
U.S. as children,” Rodriguez said in a 
press release. “We strongly encourage 
those who might be eligible for 
DACA to use this resource guide. We 
applaud the Department of Education 
for providing these resources to the 
undocumented young people in this 
country who can benefit from DACA. ”However, there are critics of this 
resource guide who assert that the 
guide is part of a political agenda. 
Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the 
Federation for American Immigration 
Reform in W ashington, D.C. explained 
in a statement that this guide is 
politically motivated.
“I think this is part of the [Obama] 
administration’s agenda to push the 
idea that if you’re in the country 
illegally, this is no big deal, ” Mehlman said to the San Diego Union-Tribune. 
“That our immigration laws are 
inconsequential. ”
The U.S. Department of 
Education plans on releasing another 
resource guide specifically geared 
toward undocumented students on 
the elementary school level in the 
next few months.blackness, transphobia, misogyny, 
anti-nativeness, anti-undocumented 
practices and discourses needs to be at 
the forefront. ” 
However, critics of the proposed 
changes say that implementing the 
State Department’s definition will limit 
people’s free speech.
Eleanor Roosevelt College senior 
Hibah Khan voiced concerns that 
these changes would constrain people’s 
abilities to fully express their opinions. 
“I think people should have the 
right to criticize Israel but not to the 
point where it becomes anti-Semitic 
speech, ” Khan said. “I do have issues 
with Israel and the decisions it made to 
get where it is, and I feel like a revised 
policy would prevent me from stating 
my opinion. ”
Khan thinks there is a difference 
between hate-speech and valid 
criticisms of Israel’s policies, and such 
a policy would undermine her ability 
to criticize the nation’s political actions. 
“I don’t think criticizing Israel 
equates to being anti-Semitic, ” Khan 
said. “Criticizing Israel is criticizing a 
country, not its religious inhabitants. 
I might disagree with Israel’s policies 
or actions, but I don’t consider this 
anti-Semitic speech because I am 
not criticizing the religion associated 
with that country, but rather the 
country itself. ”Furthermore, the Students for 
Justice in Palestine at UCSD argue 
that the proposed policy change goes 
further than simply limiting free 
speech by silencing voices on the other 
side of the debate, particularly pro-
Palestinian sentiments. 
“ Any critique of Israeli policy, 
because of the nation’s identity as 
a Jewish state, would be labeled as 
anti-Semitic, ” SJP said in a statement 
to the Guardian. “This policy is 
problematic for several reasons, 
including the conflation of Judaism 
and Zionism as well as the targeting 
and censorship of pro-Palestinian 
activists and academics. ”  
Additionally, SJP said that this 
policy change misconstrues any anti-
Zionist activities as anti-Semitic. 
“ Anti-Zionist activity, such as that 
of SJP , strives to amplify Palestinian 
voices calling for their right to self-
determination and their right to 
return to their homeland, ” SJP said. 
“This policy seeks to silence and 
censor these voices. ”
Juarez is also concerned about the 
measure limiting valid criticisms, even 
though he supports the revisions.
“I think that there are ways to 
implement guidelines that foster 
inclusivity on our campuses without 
limiting free speech, ” Juarez said. “In 
terms of Israel, I do not think that the 
university should be limiting students’ 
ability to be critical of a nation that is engaging in unlawful practices under 
international law standards. ”
While the debate continues, 
both Juarez and David are working 
to advocate for these changes. Juarez 
hopes to connect with different 
communities so that his work is 
representative of his constituency.
”I hope to engage with different 
communities to make sure that my 
work is reflective of what other folks 
and communities want out of my 
office, ” Juarez said. “ As for the UC 
[Regents], I think that they need 
to make sure that they are going to 
individual campuses, reaching out 
to individual student communities 
and listening to what it is they want 
out of the changes in the Statement 
of Principles. ” 
The Zionist Organization of 
America is using the support of 
coalition groups to advocate change. 
“Making coalition groups is 
what we’ve been doing to make our 
voice heard, ” David said. “ A lot of 
organizations, student-run, pro-
Israel groups, Jewish groups, have 
come together regardless of different 
stances to agree that defining 
anti-Semitism and incorporating 
it into the UC Statements Against 
Intolerance is very important. ”NEW S  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | THURSDAY , NOVEMBER 5, 2015 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  3

 UC President Janet Napolitano failed to include students in the conversation on carbon 
neutrality. This only serves as a reminder of  her complete disregard for student voices.A Thief  in the Night
ILLUSTRA TION   B Y  SAGE  SCHUBERT  CHRISTIANWhen you think of 
countries with the worst 
rates of rape, the United 
States is probably not your first 
thought. More likely, India tops 
that list or is at least on it. But this 
is very wrong. The U.S. is actually 
the worst country globally for rape 
cases — a lot worse.
To really get a sense of how 
much worse it is in the U.S. than 
it is in India, let’s look at the facts. 
In 2011, out of a population of 1.2 
billion — with a “b” — 24,206 rapes 
were reported. That same year, the 
U.S. had 83,425 reports of rape 
even though our population is 300 
million, according to More.com.  
The amount of rape cases that 
go unreported wouldn’t make a 
difference either, as the percentages 
of these cases are roughly equal for 
both countries: over 60 percent in 
both cases, the Rape, Abuse and 
Incest National Network (RAINN) 
estimates.
To make matters worse, the U.S. 
has a measly conviction rate as well. 
The conviction rate is determined 
by the percentage of rapists that are 
put on trial and convicted for their 
crimes. Time Magazine reports 
that in India, the conviction rate is 
24 percent. Yet, in the U.S., only 2 
percent of rapists will get convicted 
for their crimes, RAINN reports.
Despite India’s new laws 
about rape — including harsher 
punishments for perpetrators and 
more resources for rape survivors 
— the differences between India 
and the U.S. are arbitrary. 
Rape is a serious global issue 
that needs to be addressed in all 
locations equally. When looking at 
the symptoms of rape in a society, 
it’s largely the same no matter 
where you are. 
For example, in both the U.S. 
and India, the vast majority of 
rape victims knew their rapists 
before the crime — 98 percent in 
India and 82 percent in the U.S., 
according to Wonderslist and 
RAINN. 
In both countries, rape 
predominantly happens to women, 
victims are negatively stigmatized 
and shamed and physical and 
mental health consequences are the 
same.
I could continue on and on. No 
matter how it’s cut, the issue is the 
exact same. Arguments about India 
being more rural, or that more 
rapes in the United States happen at 
drunken parties or such, are rooted 
in false biases that only serve to 
convolute the issue. 
There is positive side to this: 
the solutions. The solutions taking 
place in the U.S. largely work in 
India as well: treating the crimes 
as serious criminal offenses, 
encouraging accurate reporting on 
the issue, educating citizens on the 
effects of victim blaming. These 
are all programs that yield positive 
results which are happening now 
both here and there. 
And we should implement 
India’s solutions, like adding more 
female police officers into the force.
Ultimately, this is not just an Indian 
issue or an American issue. It’s an 
international issue that also applies 
to a local level. Only by working 
together, with other cultures and 
countries, can we make the world 
safer for our women, everywhere.UC President Janet Napolitano revealed two things 
during her visit to UCSD on Oct. 27: one, an 
unfailing dedication to climate issues and two, a 
complete disregard for student voices. Two days were set 
aside for Napolitano and Gov. Jerry Brown’s visit in which 
they met with the UC Climate Solutions group to discuss 
the UC Cool Campus Initiative and the promise of carbon 
neutrality. However, this summit may as well have been the 
Council of Elrond as far as students were concerned. No 
students were invited, and we were barely informed of this 
event despite the large stake and role that we have in issues 
of climate change. Napolitano did not even attempt to meet 
with student organizations during her visit to our campus, 
and then she left like a thief in the night. 
This attitude is not unusual for this UC President. Just 
back in March, as half-naked students invaded a UC Regents 
meeting to denounce — loudly and proudly — the pending 
tuition hikes, Napolitano muttered to the regent sitting 
beside her: “Let’s go. We don’t have to listen to this crap. ” 
Our concerns are “crap” to the leader of our university 
system, whose salary we pay and whose power we grant. 
However, she would never let us know how little we mean 
to her. She thought her microphone was off and that no one 
would hear. No; instead she puts on a face and listens only to what she wants to hear. At an earlier point of the same 
meeting, she dishonestly insisted, “[Students] want to be 
sure that their voices are being heard, and I want to commit 
to them that their voices are being heard. ” If it looks like a 
two-face, and it sounds like a two-face, it’s probably Janet. 
The sad part is that Napolitano is not incompetent. 
She has spent much of her life managing larger and more 
complicated systems than the UC campuses. Before stepping 
into her current office as the president, she had already been 
both the governor of Arizona and the Secretary of Homeland 
Security. And before that, she proved her academic 
intelligence as the first female valedictorian of Santa Clara 
University. In other words, she’s not a rookie. Furthermore, 
the duties allocated to the UC president are not education-
oriented; rather they merely deem her responsible for 
running the UC system as efficiently as possible, which she 
may or may not do. The point is that Napolitano has the 
ability and power to do great things for the University of 
California. But she doesn’t.
Why? Because she values her role as a politician more 
than her role as a leader, leading her to pay more attention to 
finances than her actual constituents — students. Moreover, 
she lacks an understanding of the concerns of students, 
many of whom have yet to even reach the legal drinking

achievements, sometimes to a fault. 
The computer science department 
ranks with some of the best in the 
world, and there are a myriad of 
students who are qualified or are 
working to become qualified at 
creating a quality user interface for 
software and web design, among 
other subjects. So it doesn’t make 
any sense that the UCSD webmail 
service is such a buggy 1995 
throwback. Well, the pleasant news 
is that, according to the Academic 
Computing and Media Services 
staff, ACMS is finally moving its 
email hosting over to Gmail, and, 
in fact, freshman email accounts 
are already hosted through Gmail.
This is a positive move for 
students because of the vast 
technological improvement from 
the old email system to Gmail. 
Even though many students just 
have their UCSD email forwarded 
to another main email account, 
it is a chore every time students 
access their UCSD email. For 
most upperclassman students, 
the current UCSD email is hosted 
through Squirrelmail, a company 
which, according to its website, last 
issued an update in 2013. Despite 
the relatively recent update, the 
user interface resembles that of a 
much older software.There is a long list of problems 
with Squirrelmail, from its lack 
of a “Select All” option to its 
slow speeds and lagginess to its 
horribly inefficient way of adding 
attachments. Though it may be 
more trivial than these other 
offenses, one strong indicator of 
Squirrelmail being out of touch is 
the recent button-graphic update. 
Instead of the old icons for “Inbox” 
and “Compose” and others, the 
programmers seem to have gone 
out of their way to add an update 
that moved from ugly pictures to 
the sort of cheesy, glossy button 
designs last seen in 2008 popup 
ads. It’s a perfect example of “too 
little, too late. ”
Switching over to Google’s 
email hosting service can only be 
better in terms of graphics and user 
interface, especially since Google, 
alongside Apple, has been one of 
the pioneers of user-friendliness 
and simple design. In fact, there 
appear to be few tangible reasons 
why ACMS has waited this long 
for an update. Though it would 
be hard to know exactly what 
happened in ACMS to prevent this 
long-overdue update, it’s very likely 
a mix of laziness, red tape and lack 
of resources.
According to Quyen Tran, an 
Instructional Technology Support 
Assistant who works with ACMS, one of the main reasons for the 
slow update is the challenging task 
of changing web hosting for over 
20,000 email addresses. ACMS 
has been moving undergraduate 
emails from Squirrelmail to Gmail 
in batches of about 4,000 and plans 
to be done by roughly the end of 
this quarter. It has created a team 
specifically for this task to ensure 
that there aren’t any hiccups.
Another difficulty that Tran 
mentioned with moving over to 
another email server is data security. 
Since Google is well known for 
data mining and selling personal 
information to companies for 
advertisement targeting purposes, 
talks with Google about moving over 
to Gmail have included making sure 
that students’ data is secure. It’s likely 
that this is one of the concerns that 
slowed down the move to Gmail, 
since there are UC policies in place 
that prevent such data gathering.
Since ACMS has apparently been 
able to secure such a deal, students 
are finally able to take for granted 
that their email looks like something 
that was designed in the last five 
years. And they should be able to. 
We go to a school that prides itself 
on STEM fields and cutting-edge 
research. Now that the student email 
doesn’t look like a total joke, UCSD 
can live up to that reputation just a 
bit more.Old, Buggy Email Server Anticipates a Long Overdue Update

age. This is very unlike her 
former constituency in Arizona, 
where there will soon be as 
many people over the age of 60 
as there are under 17. While 
she certainly is an expert on the 
elderly, as showcased in her 2005 
Arizona brief, “Plan for an Aging 
Population, ” Napolitano is not 
the right leader for our college 
campus, let alone 10 of them. She 
has never dealt with such a high 
concentration of angry, debt-ridden 
and stressed college students. Even 
her experience in the Department 
of Homeland Security was limited to mostly older white men. The 
DHS employee makeup is more 
than half white, two-thirds male 
and two-thirds 40 or older. In 
contrast, of the 238,000 UC 
students, Asian, white and Latino/
Chicano ethnicities are almost 
equally represented, and 93 percent 
of the student body is under the age 
of 25. We are not a demographic 
she is used to, but rather than 
seeking to bridge ethnic and 
generational gaps she does not want 
to listen to our “crap. ” 
Look, it’s not that we think 
she wakes up each morning 
cackling and seeking new ways to 
harass students. We don’t think she’s evil, maniacal or vindictive. 
But as long as she continues to 
snub her constituency in favor of 
headline-grabbing initiatives, we 
will continue to strip half-naked 
and march against her superficial 
policies until she decides to invest 
emotionally in our struggles and 
financially in our needs. If we could 
afford tuition and govern ourselves, 
we would. However, this is not the 
case. Instead, the UC president 
is appointed to lead us. But 
Napolitano has done neither, and 
she has not indicated any genuine 
intention to do so. And that truly 
sucks. Because as much as Janet 
needs our support, we need hers.

The Beauty Inside
Made in Japan
An
Mountains May Depart
Out of My Hand
Taxi
Baek Jong-Y eol’s “The Beauty Inside” (2015) is a meditation on love and identity; a surrealist waltz between romantic drama and high-concept sci-fi. Based on Intel and Toshiba’s 
2012 social film, “The Beauty Inside” revolves around furniture designer Woo-jin (portrayed by an array of actors), who wakes up every day in a different body, ethnicity, age and gender. 
Struggling with a constant sense of loneliness and an inability to maintain relationships, Woo-jin immerses himself in his work in order to find meaning in his life. When he meets Yi-soo 
(Han Hyo-joo), a furniture sales agent, Woo-jin falls in love almost immediately. The film follows their developing relationship as he takes to increasingly desperate measures to stay in the 
same body, afraid that if he changes, he’ll never be able to see her again. What follows is a moving story tinged with humor and shaded in emotional depth. “The Beauty Inside” is unusual in 
its premise but complex in its oddity; a truly bittersweet exploration of love. —  DEREK DENG

Documentaries are best suited to digging up hidden nuggets of gold that have been glossed over by the 
years. The story of Tomi Fujiyama is such a treasure; one that has finally been brought to light. The truth is, 
she was Japan’s first female country-singing star in the 1960s. Yes, it’s no joke. She grew up singing western 
music, began performing in Las Vegas and finally reached the pinnacle of her career at the Grand Ole Opry 
in Nashville. She stood on the same stage as the likes of Johnny Cash, receiving a standing ovation on a night 
that would forever be emblazoned in her mind. This is the account of her return to that hallowed ground over 
40 years later. It’s not an easy road, but along the way Tomi 
wins us over with a smile that lights up the room and a true 
passion for music that few others can claim.

The impatient and downhearted middle-aged owner of a “Dorayaki” (Japanese pancake) shop is looking for an assistant, and a 76-year-old lady 
comes to apply for the job. Adept at making extraordinarily tasty “ An” (red bean paste), the lady is hired despite her age and crippled hands. The new 
and much better taste of An soon attracts an unprecedented amount of customers, yet a surprising turning point of the film comes along. Will they 
be able to continue working together and maintaining the business?
As the opening film for the Un Certain Regard section at the 2015 Cannes, “ An” is a tender and scenic film that discusses the meaning of life 
and the relationship between humans and nature. Sceneries of sakura blossoms, close-up shots of Japanese pastry and the philosophy of respecting 
everything (including red beans) all contribute to the uniqueness of the story. It is a warm movie that leaves you misty-eyed, contemplative and 
empathetic. —  YIDIAN HUANG

Time flows like an unending river and our ability to cope with it determines whether we float or sink. “Mountains May Depart” forces 
your hand with this realization. To director Jia Zhangke and many in China, the passage of time has passed by at too swift a rate. Instead 
of setting this concern in the forefront, Zhangke anchors us in late 1999 with Tao (Tao Zhao) and two friends vying for her attention, poor 
miner Zhang Jinsheng (Yi Zhang) and pro-capitalism Liangzi. The ensuing drama is spread over decades and destinations, letting a family 
networked with long-standing memories of grudges and debts steadily unravel. The daily processes of life are always captured by the wary 
camera of Jia Zhangke, often straying away and focusing on the minutiae in life that we often use as no more than reference points. Thirty 
years pass and the only constants left standing besides time are actions. Humans are creatures of habit, passing on the same recipe and 
bringing up the same stories, generation after generation. It’s not complacency after a certain point — it’s comfort.

Who would have ever thought a small Liberian film 
would be featured at a premiere Asian film festival? 
And a film with such an understated power, ruminating 
on the American Dream. This is the case with writer/
director Takeshi Fukunaga’s “Out of My Hand” — an 
incredible film chronicling the journey of Cisco, a 
Liberian rubber tapper struggling to escape the sufferings 
of a prevailingly hostile world. 
Bursting onto the cinematic scene with his first 
narrative feature, new talent Fukunaga films with such 
sure-handed instincts that he might as well be a master 
veteran. The film’s cinematography, brimming with 
quietly gorgeous images, is perhaps only outdone by 
Liberian non-actor Bishop Blay in his restrained yet 
nuanced leading role performance. Winner of Los 
Angeles Film Festival’s Grand Jury Prize, “Out of My 
Hand” may still be a lesser-noticed film at SDAFF , but it’s 
a hidden gem you will not want to miss.“Despite my heartfelt wish, this film has no credits. ” Thus concludes Jafar Panahi’s 
“Taxi. ” The words are disturbing. They should be. Panahi, banned in 2010 by the Iranian 
government from directing any films, has, yet again, responded with a beautiful “fuck you” 
that is both a celebration and an accusation. To start with the latter, “Taxi” is itself an act 
of political dissent. The film follows Panahi himself pretending to 
be a taxi driver, conversing with a number of passengers as he 
drives across Tehran. Panahi exposes Iran’s repressive law 
of “distributable films” by laughing at it. Indeed, “Taxi” 
should be seen as a reductio ad absurdum of Panahi’s 
ban and persecution. After multiple arrests, a 
six-year jail sentence, and being prohibited 
from leaving the country, he’s still there: 
dressed as a cabbie, making movies 
with a smile in his face. “Taxi, ” with its 
passionate social criticism, turns into 
a celebration of art and the will to 
rebel. The film has no credits. Who 
cares? The point is that it exists.

What should I put 
on a resume? —  
Anonymous
Unless you’ve undergone an 
inconvenient case of amnesia, 
always put your name in neat 
print at the top. If you haven’t 
learned from the second grade core 
curriculum, forgetting your name 
can lead to disastrous events, such 
as the appearance of rogue copycats 
or existential questioning of the 
nomenclature system. And avoid 
Times New Roman: It signals a case 
of the “I’m a job-seeking android, ” 
and it’s far from fashionable. 
Besides, you might want to try out 
some cool, hip new fonts, such 
as Helvetica (to show you love 
Tumblr) or Courier (to show that 
you’re the definition of au courant). 
Here’s what you should avoid 
on all resumes: two spaces after a 
period. There is no exception to 
this rule. Using two spaces is every 
indicator that you are too ancient 
for new-age technology, such as an 
iPad, or that Saturn has moved into 
your third house and is causing 
emotional turmoil. Farhad Manjoo 
is screaming.
Abiding by the golden rule 
— only put what information is 
relevant to your application — is, 
quite frankly, asinine. If you are 
one in 1,000 applicants for a job 
at Google, stating the fact that 
you’re an avid connoisseur of 
phytoplankton consumption and a 
regular fanatic of anthropomorphic 
fursuit construction could be 
the deciding factor in your big 
break. Employers, in an idealistic 
world, want to see the true you 
— perhaps not the Tumblr side of 
you, but they want to know that 
you possess a fully functional brain 
and not a computer algorithm. 
If you’re looking to be modest, 
twist all of your life experiences 
into the qualifications necessary 
to show that you are a passionate 
person. Vocabulary and jargon are 
everything. For example, if you’re 
applying to be an intern at a non-
profit, it might be useful to bring 
up the fact that you “spearheaded 
a campaign designed to advocate 
for the cognizance of internalized 
trauma from colonialism on 
our societal model during your 
matriculated tenure” or the fact that 
you’re a “team player who knows 
how to get colleagues going!”

The story of W arby Parker 
started in 2010 at Wharton, the 
business school of University 
of Pennsylvania. Since then, the word 
about W arby has spread across the 
country, from New Y ork, Austin, Seattle 
and San Francisco to other major cities. 
Now, much to its fans’ delight, W arby 
Parker has settled down in San Diego. 
If you have never heard of W arby, you 
might have prematurely concluded that 
it is a person. The truth is, W arby Parker 
is a brand of prescription eyeglasses and 
sunglasses that recently opened its store 
at Westfield Shoppingtown UTC.
“We are a literary-based company, ” 
said the store leader of the San Diego 
location, Anthony Velazquez. Indeed, 
literature is a leitmotif of W arby Parker’s 
history and brand culture. The business 
itself is named after two Jack Kerouac 
characters — W arby Pepper and Zagg 
Parker. The story of the company also 
started like a novel — Dave Gilboa, 
W arby Parker’s co-founder and co-CEO 
who grew up in San Diego, once went 
on a camping trip where he lost his 
glasses. That was when he realized 
that buying a new pair of frames (a 
vital accessory for many) every time 
you lose them was too expensive due 
to an eyewear-market monopoly. This 
understanding motivated him to come 
together with his fellow students to 
start an eyeglasses business within the 
Venture Initiation Program. Rooted 
in the simple desire to help people 
read, W arby Parker rapidly grew into 
a prosperous brand with a $1.2 billion 
revenue. Sounds like an example from a 
“How to be a Successful Entrepreneur” 
book, doesn’t it?
But literary analogies do not end 
here, since W arby Parker actively 
collaborates with publishers to sell 
both classic and contemporary books 
chosen by the product team at its 
retail stores. UTC’s location currently 
features “The True Deceiver” (1982) by 
Swedish-Finnish author Tove Jansson, 
contemporary art journal “Paper 
Monument, ” literary magazine “n+1” 
and other reads that customers can 
purchase together with or instead of 
glasses. In addition, books sorted by 
cover colors serve as decorations on 
minimalist shelves with frames. San 
Diegans will also find a custom mural 
of two people lying on a swimming 
mattress shaped as a book, created by 
Jean Jullien exclusively for the store.
While one can find W arby Parker’s 
history and aesthetic to be truly 
poetic, the brand got its reputation 
for being affordable, practical and 
sustainable. Many know W arby Parker 
for its unique home try-on service that 
allows customers to ship five frames 
to their door, try them on at home, 
then chose the glasses that best fit and 
send the other four pairs back. But as the company is extending its offline 
presence, San Diegans should take an 
advantage of having a retail location 
nearby. At the store, W arby Parker keeps 
it simple: When you come into the 
shop with your prescription, the store 
adviser will ask you questions to decide 
which frame would work best for you. 
Unlike the associates at the majority of 
multi-brand eyewear boutiques, W arby 
Parker advisers are not interested in 
pushing a certain brand line because it 
is more expensive. Lifestyle-oriented, 
they will make sure that your new 
glasses match your everyday life and, 
obviously, your face. Because someone 
should honestly tell you this cute frame 
does not work well with your oval face 
shape. The fact that all employees wear 
glasses themselves (big secret — some of 
them have plain lenses) only adds to the 
feeling of their professionalism.
After you choose your ideal frame 
— don’t forget to try on Robinson 
sunglasses, designed especially for San 
Diego — W arby Parker will send your 
order to one of the six labs throughout 
the country. Unless you are buying 
sunglasses that can be immediately 
picked up at the store, it usually takes 
seven to 10 business days for a lab to 
process a standard prescription glasses 
order. The company not only offers 
frames with standard lenses but also 
produces “progressive” lenses that 
combine multiple lens powers for all 
viewing distances, which allow a person 
to wear the same pair for reading, 
working on a computer and living a 
high-resolution life. Y ou can also replace 
the glasses with the free “no questions 
asked” guarantee in case something feels 
wrong within the first 30 days.
However, what truly distinguishes 
Warby Parker from any other 
eyewear brand is that all services are 
available for lower prices. By avoiding 
intermediaries through designing, 
producing and selling its own glasses, 
it maintains the product’s’ affordability. 
Price policy seems to perfectly match 
the needs of San Diego population 
— students can purchase glasses for 
only $95, and wealthy members of La 
Jolla community can spend up to $395 
on their customized Warby Parkers. 
“Really, we are just thinking about how 
we can do good for the most people 
possible in this location, ” Velazquez 
added, summing up the main goal of 
Warby Parker in San Diego.
Before W arby Parker came to San 
Diego, loyal customers had to drive to 
Los Angeles to partake in the brand. 
Now that W arby Parker has successfully 
become a part of the UTC retail family, 
it has all the chances to win the hearts 
of San Diego community. In the end, 
we have already forgotten what used to 
be there before W arby Parker opened 
its doors.Warby Parker Came to UTCI Can See For Miles:

If you want fantastic service in a 
restaurant, come in with a friend, 
order water and half a bottle of 
wine and place a fork on the ground. 
This is, according to “Burnt, ” what 
Michelin agents do when judging a 
restaurant. In “Burnt, ” Chef Adam 
Jones (Bradley Cooper) has been 
waiting his entire life to impress these 
agents. He had squandered his talent 
and destroyed his career on drugs, 
alcohol and women years earlier. 
But after years of penitence, the chef 
travels to London to redeem himself by opening a restaurant that can 
receive the coveted three Michelin 
Stars, the most prestigious award in 
the culinary world. What could have 
been a compelling redemption story 
is unfortunately bogged down by 
unwelcome cliches and a script that 
was far too easy to come up with. 
Although “Burnt” finds success due 
to its excellent cast of characters and 
stunning displays of culinary mastery, 
the film’s lackluster storytelling 
keeps the film from being great. 
Bradley Cooper is infectiously likeable as Chef Adam Jones. Even 
when he is less than noble (yelling at 
his staff or flipping chairs), it is hard 
not to root for the chef ’s success. 
Cooper expertly portrays both Chef 
Jones’s calmness in some moments 
and his intensity in others. Daniel 
Bruhl’s acting talent is also on display 
as he portrays a restaurant owner who 
gives his kitchen away to Chef Jones. 
The chef’s kitchen staff is a crack 
team of stock characters, including 
an ex-con, a motivated but amateur 
cook, a talented single mother and 
an old friend done wrong. All of 
these characters were shaped with 
a cookie cutter, but the ensemble 
works well. Aside from a rich cast, 
the film features slick shots of kitchen 
equipment, culinary technique and 
strange but wonderful-looking food.
At one point in the film, Chef 
Jones mentions that the problem with fast food is that it is too 
consistent and that a chef ’s job is 
to find new and unique ways to 
make food that would otherwise 
be generic.The redemption story is 
one that is often told in a film, but 
“Burnt, ” not taking Chef Jones’s 
own advice and does not find a 
unique way to navigate between 
its simple three-act structure. 
While the cast and characters 
keep the story engaging, the film 
is predictable and contains far too 
many cliche elements. For example, 
a single mom starts working closely 
with Chef Jones. Could this end 
in anything other than romance?
There is a reason people watch 
“Top Chef. ” It features not only 
delicious food that we have a small 
chance of ever trying but also the 
high octane process by which the 
food is made. This is the recipe “Burnt” uses successfully, as a great 
deal of this film takes place inside 
the kitchen. However, despite the 
amount of food Chef Jones cooks up, 
he is never convincingly portrayed 
as a culinary genius. Walter White 
is believable as a chemistry genius 
because he broke down chemical 
reactions and utilized his vast 
scientific knowledge. Chef Jones 
is meant to be the culinary Walter 
White, but he is never portrayed 
as being such. In the end, we are 
made to believe that Adam Jones 
is a brilliant chef because he gets 
angry and throws plates against the 
wall. Unfortunately, no amount of 
cliche chef anger could save “Burnt” 
from simply being unremarkable.

“Our Brand Is Crisis. ” 
The title itself reflects 
the sophistry that 
goes into getting a candidate 
elected. The attempt to sputter out 
a story was fettered to mediocrity 
by its own script, following in the 
footsteps of any good politician by 
making empty promises. All too 
unfortunate is the fact that there 
were opportunities to delve into 
underlying issues surrounding both 
the fictional and the actual 2002 
presidential election in Bolivia. 
Although the film focuses on a 2002 election in Bolivia, the message 
and themes are applicable to our 
elections, to say the least. Released 
a little over a week after the first 
Democratic debate, the film takes 
us behind the scenes and into the 
chaotic, intricate realm of the electoral 
market. The 2015 fictional political 
satire is based on Rachel Boynton’s 
2005 documentary with the same title, 
illustrating how the then-presidential 
candidate Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada hired a team of American 
political consultant masterminds, 
including Bill Clinton’s former campaign manager Jim Carville, to 
win the presidential election. Castillo 
represents Lozada in the 2015 film 
and appropriately alludes to the 
former president’s icy, disconnected 
persona. Y et, “Our Brand Is Crisis” 
fails to explore Castillo’s character 
beyond the fact that he’s a reticent, 
rich businessman who is disconnected 
from reality. Spoiler alert: Castillo is 
an asshole. But why were people so 
vehemently opposed to him initially? 
That still remains unclear. The scant 
details surrounding Castillo’s first-
term in office and the minimal context 
regarding the constant protests bar 
the viewer from appreciating Bodine, 
and thus Bullock’s sublime efforts.
Nevertheless, Bullock embraces 
Bodine’s road to redemption, 
portraying her brilliance, her raw 
but energizing imperfections, 
and shows us how to win a plural 
election, step by step. She is able to couple the self-assured, bombastic 
personality of Margaret Tate (“The 
Proposal, ” 2009) with the resolute 
yet gracious Leigh Anne Tuohy 
(“The Blind Side, ” 2009), which won 
her the Oscar for best actress that 
same year. Bullock’s persona gives 
us the most insight into the electoral 
market along with the few exchanges 
between her and her arch nemesis 
Pat Candy, played by Billy Bob 
Thornton. We don’t get much else 
besides that, since the scenes jump 
quickly between protest scenes, 
strategy sessions and an occasional 
camera shot alluding to social 
iniquities within Bolivia. In terms of 
elections, we are told that candidates 
are created, polished and advertised 
to the public. And we leave with a 
superficial understanding of the 
process which could have taken 
fewer than 15 minutes to explain. 
Furthermore, screenwriter Peter Straughan incorporates Spanish into 
the script but, again, teases us and 
fails to deliver. Castillo alternates 
between Spanish and English, which 
makes sense considering he hired 
American consultants, yet he speaks 
English to his Spanish-speaking 
campaign volunteers and practices 
speeches written for the Spanish-
speaking Bolivian populace in 
English. Not only is this awkward, 
but it once again demonstrates 
how, even on a micro-level, “Our 
Brand Is Crisis” made critical errors. 
With a theme that is close to home 
and with a solid cast, one cannot help

by   The  neighbourhood
Release Date Oct. 30The Neighbourhood’s newest album strives 
to capture new sounds with a mixed success.ALBUM   REVIEW
Blending psych, R&B and pop, 
The Neighbourhood’s second 
album, “Wiped Out!” , invokes 
beachy vibes in a laid-back, soulful 
manner. The Southern California-
based band’s second album maintains 
the distinct tone of its first, while 
developing a darker sound through 
edgy, moody lyrics.           
Formed in 2011, The 
Neighbourhood rose to fame with its 
2013 single “Sweater Weather. ” With 
the band’s monochrome aesthetics, 
mellow vibes and original music, 
The Neighbourhood is reminiscent 
of The XX and more upbeat music, 
creating a unique sound that attracts 
a wide range of listeners. Its much 
anticipated second album, “Wiped 
Out!” , released on Oct. 30, maintains 
the same moody, atmospheric feel 
while attempting to incorporate 
grittier and more substantial lyrics. 
“Wiped Out!” provides a more 
high energy feel than “I Love Y ou, ” 
but it maintains the same minor, 
bittersweet tone of the first album. 
“Wiped Out!” , the album’s title 
song, most resembles the tone of 
its first with lyrics such as “lost and 
afraid … I don’t wanna be alone. ” 
The heartbeat-like rhythm conveys 
the deep emotions present in the 
song, successfully honoring the 
band’s core sound. “Greetings from 
California” also harkens back to the 
band’s Southern California roots, 
pairing ukulele background noises with beach recordings. The haunting 
echoes of “What’s in the water?” 
effectively accentuate the song, 
conveying the relaxed vibe that The 
Neighbourhood does best.
Tracks like “Ferrari” and “Baby 
Came Home 2” attempt to add 
dimension and diversity to the 
album’s style, yet underwhelm. 
“Baby Came Home 2” combines 
the low key “ooh ahs” predominant 
in “I Love Y ou” with a quick yet 
melancholy beat that gives the song 
a minor tone for an initially upbeat 
song. This fails to pair well with the 
overall beachy tone that persists 
throughout the song, resulting in 
a disjointed and fragmented piece. 
“Ferrari” begins with loud, strange 
noises meant to mimic the sound 
of a revving engine, yet it doesn’t 
manage to do much else musically. 
It’s a song meant to intrigue; while 
one can appreciate the creative 
effort, the grating sounds come off as 
trying too hard to change the band’s 
musical presence.      
Despite the songs that fall flat, the 
album successfully captures listeners’ 
interests through mellow vocals 
juxtaposed with more lively beats. In 
“Wiped Out!” , The Neighbourhood 
preserves an airy, emotional sound, 
despite attempts to diversify it in an 
ultimately mediocre album.

Indie rock band Colony House is bringing back old-school rock’n’roll, 
invigorating crowds nationwide with powerfully  energetic live shows.
Quieting the room as he tunes 
his guitar, Caleb Chapman 
jokes with the audience 
and explains their Tennessee roots, 
welcoming all to sing with him. 
Headlining a tour for the first time, 
the alternative rock band pulled out 
all of their new tricks at their show at 
The Loft on Oct. 21st. With a backlit 
bass drum broadcasting their logo 
and gramophone lights on either side 
of the stage, the up-and-coming trio 
performed their full debut album, 
“When I W as Y ounger, ” and rewarded 
the audience with some new material. 
In the hazy fog of mid-tour exhaustion, 
the group discussed their lifestyle on 
tour and what can be expected from 
the band in the upcoming months. 
Colony House has experienced no 
pressure while adjusting to the life of 
traveling musicians. 
They spoke of “breaking down 
walls” and establishing immediate close 
friendships with other groups while 
opening for Sir Sly and KONGOS on a 
national tour earlier this year. 
“Eighty percent of touring is ‘the 
hang’ with other acts, ” Chapman, the 
guitarist and lead singer explained to 
the Guardian, “making connections 
with the bands is important for the 
tour to go well. ” 
Caleb explains that part of the fun 
involves raiding the stage during a 
supporting artists set to add vitality to 
the show and play along with the song. 
“It started organically, ” he told 
the UCSD Guardian. “It’s fun for 
the bands and I think it’s fun for the 
crowds. It’s also something you can’t 
get anywhere else except at that venue 
at that moment in time. ” 
Facing the challenge of filling larger 
rooms than they ever have before, 
Colony House has ramped up the energy and intensity of their live show. 
“They were bigger venues than 
we’re used to, ” Caleb Chapman noted. 
“We were excited about that, because it 
was new territory for us. ” 
The band showcased their 
versatility with softer acoustic folk 
tunes, like “Moving Forward, ” and 
heavy, blues-influenced rock jams. 
There’s no doubt they brought classic, 
old-fashioned power when they filled 
The Loft with their wild rock sound, 
easily stepping into the shoes of a 
headliner. Given the spotlight, the 
band demonstrated their full range of 
capabilities, bringing the energy level 
down with quieter folk songs and 
raising the roof with a raucous outro of 
“2:20” that stimulated the crowd into 
a headbanging, fist-pumping state of 
unified action. 
Colony House finds its inspiration 
in its journey, approaching lyrics 
almost biographically. 
“This is our life, ” Caleb Chapman 
said. “These are the things that happen 
in our life. We’re just journaling it… 
We don’t have an agenda, we want to 
be transparent with the lyrics. ” Its first album, “When I Was 
Y ounger, ” clearly delves into old 
relationships and events, hinting at 
important memories in “Silhouettes” 
and “Waiting for My Time to Come. ” 
In fact, the band name Colony 
House originates from an apartment 
complex in their hometown of 
Franklin, Tennessee, which has 
played an integral role in the personal 
lives and relationships of each of the 
band members. 
When asked about songs that 
have influenced them and that they 
currently cover, the trio immediately 
came back with classic jams. 
“If the subject matter wasn’t what 
it was, I still think it would be really 
fun to do ‘Pretty Woman’ by Roy 
Orbison. Because it’s awesome, it’s 
got a great riff, ” Scott Mills, the lead 
guitarist, admitted.
“We love Roy Orbison, ” Caleb 
chimed in. “We rock out to Roy 
Orbison. We’re fans of old-school. ” 
The band also threw out The 
Ramones’ rendition of The Beach 
Boys’ “Do Y ou W anna Dance” as a go-
to cover song they jam out to together. 
After finishing up their brief road 
trip, the band will head back to the 
studio to put together their upcoming 
album. Chapman has indicated that 
it will feature the powerful rock feel 
that they have developed in their live 
performances, but still emphasize 
lyrical depth and purpose. Excited by 
the responses from crowds and looking 
forward to the prospect of putting 
together a new album, Colony House 
has embraced the “new territory” they 
have found themselves in and adapted 
to the spotlight of a band on the rise.

PHOTO BY MEGAN LEE /UCSD GUARDIANusty lunch boxes, peacock-shaped brooches and Zooey 
Deschanel. Just a few of the many eclectic items and 
people we might associate with the word “vintage. ” And 
at San Diego’s annual Vintage Flea Market, hosted in the 
eccentric and whimsical neighborhood of North Park, 
anything goes when vintage expands from an object 
(or an actress) to a lifestyle. For those of us with whom 
“ American Pickers” deeply resonates with, North Park’s 
Vintage Flea Market is a must in order to get your fix of 
the quirky, the classic and the unconventional. 
It’s hard to classify this emporium of goods — 
everything, from retro vinyls, 1950s kitchenware and 
Mark Rothko replicas to handcrafted vanities, re-
furnished loveseats and antique game boards, can be 
bought and sold in this Mr. Magorium-esque “flea for all. ” 
With 72 vendors and counting, this flea market is bound 
to be the place to satisfy all your bargain and discount 
desires. Need a perfectly destroyed rocking chair to fit 
your Anthropologie-based living room? Check out F & 
H Salvage Co. for traditional furniture pieces repurposed 
with a rustic aesthetic. What about a smart wardrobe, 
with bold prints and muted neutrals, all inspired by the 
1940s? Well, look no further than La Femme Moderne — a boutique of epic Parisian proportions. Or maybe 
horticulture is where your heart lies. Make sure to stop 
by The Perfect Plant for succulents and cacti housed in 
anything and everything, from seashells to terracotta pots 
to household kitchenware.
And if absolutely none of this intrigues you, at least 
go to support a charitable cause. This year, the market is 
sponsored by Lionel’s Legacy Senior Dog Rescue and is 
accepting any donation, from unopened cans of food to 
clean blankets and toys. So bring your pup and your cash 
to this Sunday San Diego tradition that’s as classic as its 
merchandise.

Swim Squad to Take on Division-I Rival UC Santa Barbara
Men’s Tennis to Open Winter Schedule against USD in Januaryjust shy of getting an NCAA qualifying 
mark, earning a 248.63 for the one-
meter board and 244.58 on the three-
meter board. 
Watkins, Heale, Sin and Abrantes  
were all winners of a pair of individual 
events, with W atkins placing first in 
the 200 free, Heale in the 100 free, 
Sin in both her events and Abrantes 
in both diving events. Senior Colleen 
Daley was able to win a pair of 
individual events as well in the sprints 
(24.21, 52.90), and she was joined by 
sophomore Julia Toronczak who won 
the 100 (58.38) and 200 backstroke 
(2:07.73), junior Zachary Y ong who 
won the 200 breaststroke (2:05.62) and 
200 individual medley (1:56.48) and 
freshman Alejandro Ortiz who won 
the distance races (9:43.50, 4:42.13).
[Coach Marko Djordjevic] knows 
what to do to train me the right way, ” 
W atkins told the UCSD Athletics 
Department. “Getting that confidence 
in practice really helps me get 
motivated. I actually broke my ankle 
over the summer, so that was another 
setback that made me that much more 
motivated to come back and do better.Individual event winners for 
UCSD included junior Julian Jacobs 
(100 back, 50.74), junior Michael 
Cohn (200 back, 1:50.93), senior AJ 
Zaval (100 breast, 58.23), sophomore 
Angie Phetbenjakul (100 breast,

Wittenbrink (100 fly, 57.67) and 
freshmen Lily Maxfield (200 breast, 
2:22.32) and Garrett Tse (100 fly, 
50.30).
Toronczak, junior Jaimie Bryan, 
Wittenbrink and Daley were the fastest 
women’s 200 medley relay (1:47.68). 
The women’s 400 relay, which consisted 
of Daley, junior Catherine Woo, 
freshman Reagan Eickert and Huttner, 
placed first. For the men, senior 
Michael Leung, Zavala, Tse and Heale 
formed the fastest men’s 200 medley 
relay (1:32.51). Sophomore Samuel 
Lee, sophomore Austin Takeda, Leung 
and Heale formed the men’s 400 free 
relay and concluded the meet with a 
3:07.39 time.
As this was the UCSD swimming 
and diving season opener, it was the 
debut of many Tritons and the start 
of their sport careers here at UCSD. 
The Triton freshmen who made their college debuts on Halloween 
included Abrantes, Eickert, Maxfield, 
Ortiz, Tse, Victoria Adee, Delainey 
Carlin, Eishlee Jasa, Will Knox, Emily 
Lambert, Lindsey Miller and Patty 
Sullivan. Transfers Johnny Bloom, 
Aaron Clancy, Alex Rodman and 
Kawei Tan were also able to make their 
first appearances as Tritons at their 
home pool. 
“I think [the coaches] set us up, they 
put a lot of pressure on our shoulders 
for us to rise to the challenge. ... They 
put the challenge out there for us to 
swim our best, ” Heale told the UCSD 
Athletics Department. “I’m loving this 
year. Our team is meshing really well 
and everyone — men and women — 
are getting along fantastically. ”
This was the eighth year in a row 
that UCSD and NCAA Division-III 
enemy Claremont-Mudd-Scripps 
have competed against each other. 
The Tritons remain unbeaten in all of 
these matchups.
The Triton men’s and women’s 
swimmers will next compete in dual 
meets against Division-I rival UC 
Santa Barbara on Saturday, Nov. 7.
The three Tritons in the singles 
competition main draw could not 
get past the round of 32. Zhang, 
after his remarkable run through the 
qualification draw fell to University 
of Southern California’s sophomore 
Thibault Forget in two one-sided sets, 
6–1 and 6–1. Tseng won the first set 
7–6(1) against UCLA ’s sophomore 
Austin Rapp but could not muster 
anything else during the game, losing 
in three sets, with final scores of 6–0 
and 6–1 for the second and third sets. Bouillin took on top-seeded USC 
senior Max de Vroome in the round 
of 32. The Triton pushed his opponent 
to the brink of defeat, but de Vroome 
ultimately prevailed, winning on a 
third-set tiebreaker 7–5, 3–6 and 
7–6(5). De Vroome went on to be the 
winner of the singles draw. 
Bouillin and Boyd entered the 
doubles draw together but were 
defeated by Cal Poly Pomona’s 
Kolachalam and Rafael Lenhard 6–5. 
Miaule and Richard Han could not do 
much better against Loyola’s Smith 
and sophomore Alexander Bourgeois, losing 6–3. Tseng and Zhang fought 
valiantly in their game against UCSB’s 
freshmen Chase Masciorini and Cody 
Rakela but were ultimately defeated 
8–7(2).
With the fall season now 
concluded, the Tritons will look 
ahead to their first game of the winter 
schedule against University of San 
Diego, which starts on Saturday, Jan. 
16 at 1:30 p.m.▶ SWIM AND DIVE,  from page 12
deficit to two. It was Palano’s second 
goal of the season; he had tallied the 
first in the Tritons’ last matchup against 
Cal State Los Angeles on Oct. 4.
“We made a couple of little mistakes, 
and [Cal State Los Angeles makes] you 
pay, ” UCSD Head Coach Jon Pascale 
told the UCSD Athletics Department. 
“The first half was pretty even. W e were 
playing well in the second half but gave 
up an unnecessary free kick, and they 
converted on what was kind of a freak 
deflection. We had an unbelievable 
chance right after and couldn’t convert. 
It was there for us. They were able to 
put it away after that. ”
UCSD is 2–6–2 in eight CCAA 
championship appearances. This marks 
the third straight year that the Golden Eagles have ended the Tritons’ season 
— they downed UCSD in the first 
round of the NCAA Championship 
in 2014 and denied UCSD the CCAA 
crown in the league final in 2013. 
The Tritons have no seniors on their 
roster this year and will return to the 
field in 2016 with a seasoned group of 
players to vie for the CCAA title once 
again.
“ All in all, I’m happy with what 
this team was able to accomplish, ” 
Pascale commented. “We are a 
young team that battled through 
some adversity. A lot of guys played 
a lot of minutes and got some good 
experience. We beat some really 
good teams along the way. ”

the home team had superior accuracy. 
O’Laughlin nailed a shot into the upper 
right corner of the net off a cross from 
freshman forward Mary Reilly in the 
13th minute, then Reilly herself hit the 
target in the 26th to push the Tritons to 
a strong advantage.
Mere minutes after start of the 
second half, UCSD’s offense struck 
again. Sophomore midfielder Jordyn 
McNutt fired a goal home off a pass 
from Martinez to increase her team’s 
lead to three; O’Laughlin scored her 
second goal of the game just two 
minutes later to drive in the knife.
Cal Poly Pomona’s offense finally 
broke through with just over 32 
minutes left to play. Senior midfielder 
Rachel Killigrew used a free kick to 
pass to senior defender Reanne Macon, who then sent a shot just wide of senior 
goalkeeper Kelcie Brodsky’s reach to 
notch a point for the Broncos. However, 
the Tritons’ menacing lead proved too 
much for the Broncos to overcome as 
UCSD cruised to an easy win and a 
spot in the conference semifinals.
“We knew we were going to have to 
fight against Pomona, ” O’Laughlin said. 
“We played them last year, and they 
knocked us out, so we came with a fire 
and we came with a plan. ”
The Tritons will travel up to Cal 
Poly Pomona this Friday to take 
on top-seeded Sonoma State in 
hopes of advancing to the CCAA 
Championship final against the 
winner of the other semi-final

SWIM  &  DIVEThe UCSD men’s soccer team ended its bid for 
the California Collegiate Athletic Association crown 
on a disappointing 3–1 loss in the first round of the 
league tournament at Cal State Los Angeles this past 
Tuesday. The Tritons managed to creep into the CCAA 
tournament as the lowest seed after last Saturday’s game 
between Chico State and San Francisco State ended in a 
1–1 overtime draw. With the loss, the Tritons effectively 
end their season at an even 6–6–6 record, while Cal 
State Los Angeles improves to 12–3–2 and moves on in 
the tournament to face Cal Poly Pomona this Friday.
The teams stayed at a scoreless deadlock for the first 
45 minutes of Tuesday’s play. Junior defense Samuel 
Kersh then broke through for the Golden Eagles in 
the 52nd minute, hitting the target off an assist by 
senior defense Kaan 
Gultoprak. Cal 
State Los Angeles 
continued its run 
in the 76th minute 
as senior midfielder 
Eduardo Almaraz 
sent a shot home and 
increased its lead to 
three as Gultoprak 
fired one in at 82:18.

barely avoided a 
shutout when junior

Tritons played with 
a vengeance and 
routed the Broncos 
4–1 to advance to 
the semifinal this Friday. Their record now stands at an 
impressive 13–5–1, while the Broncos ended their season 
at 9–7–2.
After waiting out the storm Tuesday night, UCSD 
took to the field just after 8:30 p.m. and snagged the lead 
after sophomore midfielder Elisa Martinez scored in the 
29th minute. At the half, the weather took a turn for the 
worse — lightning flickered across the sky once again, 
and officials mandated yet another 30-minute delay. The 
match was considered a no-contest and subsequently 
postponed to Wednesday afternoon at 12:30 p.m.
“We knew we still had it in us, ” sophomore forward 
Katie O’Laughlin told the UCSD Athletics Department. 
“We knew we had it, we knew we were still fresh and we 
knew we could take it to them. ”

On this past Saturday, Halloween 
day, the men’s and women’s swim and 
dive teams started off their 2015–16 
season on a positive note as both teams 
emerged from Halloween without 
fatalities and with dual-meet victories 
over Claremont-Mudd-Scripps at 
UCSD’s Canyonview Aquatic Center. 
The Triton men’s squad came 
through with a big win as their season 
opener ended with a final score of 
203–95. Not to be outdone, the Triton 
women’s squad pulled through with 
an even bigger victory margin as they 
ended their season opener with a final 
score of 242–49. The day ended for the 
Tritons with a decisive victory for both 
squads. 
The UCSD swimmers and divers 
were able to win 28 of the 32 events that they competed in on Halloween, 
and they took the maximum amount 
of points with placements in the top 
three or two positions in 14 of 28 
individual events and three of the four 
relay events.
UCSD was also able to come away 
with four NCAA provisional qualifying 
marks. Sophomore Stephanie Sin 
swept her distance freestyle races with 
times of 10:25.05 in the 1000m and 5:05.87 in the 500m, landing two of the 
NCAA provisional qualifying marks. 
Senior Dari Watkins was also able to 
produce a mark as she went 2:04.88

Just like the women did a week 
before, the UCSD men’s tennis team 
completed its fall schedule this past 
Saturday. The Tritons competed at 
the 59th Annual Southern California 
Intercollegiate Championships, 
hosted by UCLA from Wednesday 
through Saturday. Three Tritons 
made the round of 32 in the singles 
competition: sophomore Justin 
Zhang, sophomore Eric Tseng and 
senior Axel Bouillin.
Zhang’s performance is especially 
notable, as he battled through two 
qualifying rounds to make the main 
draw. Both Tseng and Bouillin had 
high enough rankings to make the 
main draw without playing qualifying 
matches. In his two qualifying 
matches, Zhang got the best of Cal Poly Pomona’s Sreyas Kolachalam 
in three sets (6–3, 4–6, 10–4) 
before defeating UC Santa Barbara’s 
freshman Riley Scott in the final 
round of qualification in three sets, 
6–7(3), 6–3 and 10–5.
Two other Tritons reached the 
final level of qualifications but could 
not make it to the main draw.  Junior 
Alexandre Miaule got a first-round 
bye after his opponent withdrew with 
illness, but he could not overcome 
Loyola Marymount University’s 
sophomore Errol Smith, falling in 
two sets, 6–1 and 6–3. Junior JP Boyd 
escaped Azusa Pacific University’s 
Marnix Pluim in three sets in the 
opening round of qualifications (4–6, 
6–4 and 10–7), but he was no match 
for Loyola’s sophomore Jamie Thorp 
in the last round, falling 6–1 and 6–2.
