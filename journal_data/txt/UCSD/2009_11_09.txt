The UC Commission 
on the Future visited UCSD’s Price Center 
East Ballroom on Nov. 6 to listen to the concerns and needs of the UCSD community. 
The UC Office of the 
President claims to have created the commission to collect public input on various aspects of the UC system — an effort toward creating a collaborative vision of the university’s future.
The commission will report 
back to the regents with its findings in the spring or summer of 2010. Its body consists of more than than 25 members and five working groups addressing the size and shape of the UC system; education and curriculum; access and affordability; funding; and research strategies.
“The purpose of the 
commission is to gather recommendations as to how we might re-envision the future,” UC Santa Barbara professor 
and “size and shape” working group co-chair Cynthia Brown said. “Given the fiscal constraints, we want to think 
in creative ways as much as possible.” 
The commission is 
conducting a listening tour, on which it will visit each UC campus to gather ideas from staff, faculty and students on how to best address the university’s financial crisis. The commission has already visited UC Irvine, UC Merced, UC Santa Barbara and UC Santa Cruz. 
The Nov. 6 meeting at UCSD 
was led by a six-member panel: UC Santa Cruz Chancellor and “size and shape” co-chair George Blumenthal, UC San Francisco professor and “research strategies” co-chair Mary Croughan, UC Davis associate professor and “education and curriculum” co-chair Keith R. Williams, student regent and “access and affordability” co-chair Jesse Bernal and UCOP chief financial officer Peter Taylor. 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox 
opened the meeting with an introduction, and was followed by a brief speech from each panel member about his or her specific area of focus.
Pre-selected administrators, 
staff, faculty and students were then given time to speak, making way for an open comment period in which any member of the public could voice concerns to the commission.

‘Shame’ on VA Labor Contract
By Regina Ip
Contributing Writer 
Local unionized construction workers are protesting 
the V A Medical Center and Scripps Green Hospital’s 
use of private contractors, accusing the two hospitals of contributing to unfair wages and increasing statewide costs of health care. There are, however, conflicting statements from different sources as to whether or not this is the case.
Construction trade union Carpenters Local 1506 is 
claiming a labor dispute with William Rogers Drywall — a non-unionized subcontractor — as well as with general contractors the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Pacific Building Group.
The USACE has been hired by the V A  hospital, 
while the PBG is working for Scripps Green Hospital.
The Los Angeles-based worker union claimed that 
these contractors are not meeting area labor standards, such as providing payments for family health care and pensions. Union members are currently staging protests at the two sites to encourage the hospitals to hire union labor instead.
“V A hospital has an obligation to the community to 
do all it can to see that area labor-standards contractors are used for construction on their hospital, ” union heads announced in a statement.
However, according to William Rogers Drywall 
co-owner Jim Horn,  though his workers receive no pension, vacation time, dental or eye insurance, their paychecks are comparable to union ones that have medical benefits subtracted from the total. Union workers demand hours;
hospitals argue that non-unioncontractors meet labor standards.

Defense and foreign ministry offi-
cials from North Korea, the United 
States and four other countries con-vened at UCSD late last month to discuss regional security issues and the global economic crisis. 
Sponsored by the UC Institute 
on Global Conflict and Cooperation, the informal meeting — which took place from Oct. 25 to Oct. 27 — fos-tered talks between senior officials and academics from North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia  and the 
United States. Discussion focused heavily on the North Korean nuclear-weapons program. 
Defense officials were present from 
all countries except for North Korea, who instead sent only foreign-ministry officials. Where defense officials are meant to specifically address issues like nuclear proliferation and disarma-ment, foreign-ministry officials serve a more general purpose.
Ri Gun, director gen-
eral of the North Korean Ministry’s American Affairs Bureau, attended the forum along with special envoys Sung Kim, from the U.S.; Grigory Logvinov, from Russia; Huh Chul, from South Korea; Y ang Houlan, from China; and Ishii 
Masafumi, from Japan. 
According to Susan 
Shirk, director of the 
IGCC, the forum — which was part of the 20th session of the Northeast Asia Cooperation Dialogue — was not intended to result in immediate change in foreign policy. 
“Major diplomatic breakthroughs 
are never expected to result from these discus-sions, ” Shirk said. “It’s not going to achieve denu-clearization overnight. ” 
Shirk said the late-
October talks were conducted to foster the return of the official Six-Party Talks, which were initiated in 2003 when North Korea backed out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and 
discontinued when the 
United Nations Security Council condemned North Korea for nuclear activity in April 2009.
“The long-term aim is really to 
prevent the outbreak of military con-flict in the region, ” Shirk said. “We are hoping that this type of track-II dialogue will, over the long term, lay a foundation for permanent official, multilateral security organization for Northeast Asia.”
Communication between the U.S. 
and North Korea dwindled after North Korea performed nuclear testing last April. Though North Korea remains critical of official U.S. diplomatic efforts, Shirk said the NEACD forum is an attempt to encourage dialogue.
“We are hoping the discussion may 
help six-party talks resume; if possible,

POORLY DRAWN LINES By Reza Farazmand

“The real reason they’re having the 
labor dispute is because they wanted a 
union company to work for the hospi-tal, ” Horn said.
According to Scripps Green 
Hospital spokesman Johnny Hagerman, the hospital itself is not responsible for subcontracting con-struction labor; contractors like the PBG choose whom to hire for specific aspects of construction jobs.
“When unions want to bring pub-
lic attention to these things, the thing that they usually do is picket in front of the business, ” Hagerman said.
However, Hagerman explained 
that because the PBG has no physical headquarters, the union workers are holding their protests on the property of the hospital that awarded the com-pany its contract.
“So the signs that you see say 
‘Shame on Scripps, ’ [but] it’s really the union’s only way of trying to get at the construction company, ” Hagerman said. “It doesn’t have anything to do with Scripps at all. ”
Because the issue does not directly involve either of the hospitals, Scripps Green Hospital has not responded to the union. The V A Hospital  claimed it 
has communicated with the union in the past, though the union denied this.
The V A hospital released a state-
ment saying it is in compliance with the wage requirements mandated under the Davis-Bacon Act — a federal law stating that construction contracts over $2,000 commis-
sioned by federally funded companies  are 
required to provide pre-vailing local wages  and benefits.
“We are in compli-
ance with proper pay benefits, ” V A Hospital spokeswoman Cindy Butler said. “We’re not violating any laws. ”
Contractors with the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers said they will be performing an audit in the upcoming months to ensure that the V A Hospital is in compliance with the labor laws.Union workers are arguing that 
hiring non-union labor will lead to unfair wages and, ultimately, re-allo-cated taxes, when the state is forced to pay for the health care of uninsured workers. The union also provides fringe benefits for its members, such 
as paid vacation; appren-ticeship and training; and life insurance.
“I have a good sal-
ary and benefits, [so] my family lives better, ” carpenter and protester David Meling said. 
Randy Thornhill, a 
business representative for the union, said the two hospitals have not yet responded to the protest. 
“They have not told 
us anything, ” Thornhill 
said. “They’re probably going to take the position that ‘It’s out of our hands. ’ [But] we’re saying that they have a social responsibility when they select contractors that pay area standards to all their workers on all their jobs. They 
should be more [selective] of who works on their property. ”

comments from the San Diego campus and community and get their input on what the community wants to work on,” Croughan said.    Through the series of UCSD speakers, numerous concerns were raised — including fee increases, layoffs, financial aid, campus funding and differential fees. Students and faculty alike spoke to the issues closest to them, most of which stemmed from funding cuts. 
“Young professors — many of 
them have built their careers at UC,” associate professor Rachel Klein said. “That’s not going to happen any more as our jobs become degraded and funding for student and staff support evaporates. These faculty cannot be replaced by lecturers.”
A number of students and staff 
echoed Klein's concerns about decline in faculty.
“Just a few years ago, the 
undergraduate student-to-faculty ratio at UCSD was approximately 20 to one,” A.S. campuswide senator Adam Kentworthy said during the open comment period. “Faculty layoffs and hiring freezes in the past year have pushed that number to almost 40 to one. Cutting freshmen seminars at UCSD earlier this year has further distanced students from faculty. There is no replacement for face-to-face contact with a professor in the scope of education. Is this what we’re paying for?”
Many speakers disclosed concerns 
about the increase in student fees, speaking to both the fact that students may have to unenroll as fees grow higher and that prior fee increases have not necessarily produced visible results.
“When I started school here as 
an undergraduate [in 2000], I was paying about $900 for my education fee,” graduate student and former registration-fee committee chair Garo Bournoutian said. “As of today, 
the undergraduate education fee is over $1,900. It has more than doubled — but as undergraduate students, what more have you received? You have received larger classes and less faculty interaction time. That’s a big issue. If we’re looking at the future of the UC, where are we going?” 
The commission will be 
conducting the remainder of its campus visits through November and December. According to Croughan, the commission originally intended to have its recommendations completed by March 2010, but is now looking to extend this deadline to summer 2010.
The regents will be visiting 
UCSD soon as well: They have announced another open forum on Jan. 19, 2010, at which UCSD community members can voice their concerns before university officials.

that it may help the U.S. and North Korea start talking to one another with-in the context of the six-party talks, [which is] an important framework for trying to resolve issues relating to the Korean peninsula, ” Shirk said.
The global economic crisis — and 
its impact on Northeast Asia — was also discussed at the meeting.
“ An important goal that I person-
ally have, and that NEACD has, is to encourage the transformation of North Korea’s economic system so that they will introduce market-style reform, ” Shirk said.
By helping North Korea carry out 
liberal market reforms, she said, other nations can encourage the country to become more dependent on for-eign trade and investment — in turn reducing the likelihood of conflict. 
“Contact with the World Bank and 
international monetary fund are some ways we’ d like to nurture their interests in economic reform, ” Shirk said.
The group also discussed China’s 
general financial success following the crisis as a possible source of sup-port for nearby regions.
“One of the important develop-
ments is that China is recovering first, and that its recovery is helping its neighbors as well, ” Shirk said.
The first NEACD forum was held 
in 1993 at UCSD. According to Shirk, officials from China and Korea put more effort into this discussion than earlier ones.
“In the early years, China was reluc-
tant to join in these types of multilateral security dialogues, ” Shirk said. “I saw a 
tremendous change in China’s interests, so it has become a very enthusiastic supporter of multilateral security coop-eration in Asia. As for North Korea, it also has become more comfortable in participating in forums like this, in the sense that all of the members of delega-tion speak. They are a lot more relaxed and participate quite actively. ”
Since the six-party talks are not 
currently underway, the track-II dia-logue offered by NEACD may lead to official talks.
“[Y ou] can sense that all the coun-

In standard at-home rags — an 
XL fisherman’s T-shirt and shape-less UCSD sweats —  there I lay, 
surfing th 
e web for something easier 
to swallow than the usual influx of nauseating felony reports.
After about a minute of impatient 
browsing, I struck gold. There, in sepia, stood a woman in a beehive hairdo and mock turtleneck sweater. I’ d finally found my kicks — all beneath the blog heading “My Mom, the Style Icon: Moms as Fashion Muses. ”
It was too good to be true.A collection of mom photos 
uploaded by fellow surfers, the site serves as a tribute to our fearless fashionista mothers, who sported bell bottoms and chunky wooden chokers like it wasn’t a thing.
My mom, for one, had just 
emerged from the ’80s neon-spandex phase during our “take your daughter to work” bonding days. And when your mom is an aerobics instructor, her work uniform is 10 times more in your face than usual. I remember squinting at her Richard Simmons-style curls rocking out to Madonna during a Jazzercise course, bangs bouncing maniacally to every last beat of “La Isla Bonita” . 
It wasn’t until age seven that I real-
ized not every grown woman grocery shopped in spandex.
The mom fashion-icon site is 
evidence that once upon a time, our mothers strived to be emblems of fashion. They strutted their stuff, just like you and I — some maybe even at UCSD, checking themselves out in Geisel’s mirrored walkway. 
And judging from some of yester-
year’s biggest icons — Farrah Fawcett, Cyndi Lauper and the one redheaded chick from “Dallas, ” to name a few — my own mother was an attentive 
imitator, a blinking red dot on the “hot” radar.
Why, then, do 
we still feel infinitely cooler than our mothers? I mean, had technology not blessed me with the divine gift of the flat 
iron, I’ d be sporting the same unruly ’fro as Mrs. Marrujo herself, putting me one oversized-sweatshirt-and-booty-short combo away from her atrocious early ’90s phase. 
As I glanced down at the T-shirt 
I was still swimming in, it suddenly looked remarkably like something my mother would have worn over stirrup leggings when she was my age.
Shit!The same masterminds that con-
trolled our mothers’ fashion choices are still swaying our vote: the fresh, young faces owned by the media. Whether it’s Lauren Conrad (for us) 
or Twiggy (for Mom) determining 
what’s cool, it’s really no one’s fault but the money-grubbers direct-ing pop culture from the rack up. Why else would we pick up those weird, “ Afrika”-print leggings from American Apparel? For what other <PQ[*QZL¼[6W\:MILa\W.TaILLUSTRATIONS  BY KIM CYPRIAN /GUARDIAN

See REPORT page 5ON CAMPUS  — Leading up to last spring’s 
2009’s A.S. election, then-A.S. presidential hopeful Utsav Gupta made a monumental promise: he would “uncage” the Sun God Festival. 
One presidential victory and a lazy sum-
mer later, Gupta has cooked up a couple more details for his campaign promise. He’s propos-ing a party in every corner of the campus — from Revelle College’s shady cement hallways to Sixth College’s expansive green fields. While this plan may make the happiest day of the year that much better, there’s one problem: Gupta is pushing the six colleges to fund his promise. 
But if anyone wants to see such a revolution-
ary Sun God change, with limited resources and Fall Quarter already coming to a close, we’ll need to think small this first time around.
 Among other promises — Library Walk 
booths and additional ticket distribution cen-ters, to name a couple — the crux of Gupta’s vision includes pairing the colleges into teams of two (according to geographic location) for a total of three separate events the morning of the Sun God Festival. 
Said sideshows, according to Gupta, are 
entirely up to the discretion of the college councils. They could be something as gleefully simple as Sixth College’s Chocolate Fest or a full-fledged 9 a.m. concert starring a band you (sort of) dig. 
Though Gupta wants each college to make 
its Sun God Festival event its own, it’s probably too late in the budgetary game to ensure each college can afford anything more than a free hot-dog stand.
According to Marshall College Council 
Chair Tanvir Dhillon, although his council’s not willing to spend its every last penny on a Sun God event, Marshall has $7,000 in unallocated funds and $7,000 in project funds that could be used for Sun God. Warren College Council Chair Emily Law, however, said she feels her 
college would need to dig painfully deeper into its $20,000 events budget to make “Sun God: Warren” a reality. 
A.S. Associate Vice 
President of Concerts and Events Alex Bramwell said he fears that the administration won’t be game for a cam-puswide free for all. But even on the offchance that Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Penny Rue gives an inebriated ice-cream social the green light, not every col-lege is willing to pony up.
While Law said she is excited about Gupta’s 
plan, she apparently doesn’t foresee Warren dip-ping into its reserves to fund it. It’s important to remember that reserves are just that: reserves. If college councils do use their reserves this year, they won’t be a reliable funding source for future Sun God popcorn stands. 
Every college, with the exception of Eleanor 
Roosevelt, has already passed its budget for the year, so picking up an entirely new event  will be 
far from smooth sailing. Just two weeks ago, Muir College passed a referendum necessary just to keep existing orgs and events afloat. With such full plates already, expanding college coun-cils’ commitments would be irresponsible. 
Another major concern for Law  is that 
because t
he funds for a Sun God event would be 
coming out of Warren’s student fees, it should be primarily benefitting Warren students. While the entire student body may not make it to each college event — blacked-out Muir freshmen probably won’t care to stumble all the way to Warren for a free romp in a bouncy house — in passing the bill to the already emaciated college-council budgets, Gupta is blurring the A.S. and college council funding lines out of their com-fort zone. 
 Currently, none of the college councils have 
even an estimate of the size or cost of the Sun God Festival events Gupta has proposed. And just in terms of safety and security, every col-lege would have to follow a set of UC Police Department stipulations and regulations. 
Last year, Muirstock security cost $3,100. 
Even though Gupta doesn’t anticipate the individual colleges to host events as large as Muirstock, since no event of uncaged-Sun God magnitude has ever been planned, college councils are swimming in murkily untested waters, especially in terms of security costs. A.S. Concerts and Events spent nearly $60,000 on security last year — a pretty sum that would rise by the thousands once our beloved day of may-hem is spread across the entire campus.
In the end, who doesn’t want this to work? 
So hopefully, Gupta’s Disneyland dream won’t end up another half-baked idea stuck in the pipeline. Financing college-specific events will 
require a strict sense of fiscal conservatism 
that the A.S. Council has not so far expressed when referencing their newly inflated Sun God budget. Recruiting student bands and looking to local vendors for cheap catering (quality be damned — free food is free food) could help keep the cost of these events low. The goal of these daytime gigs, after all, is to unite our stu-dent body — not to divide the college and A.S. councils even further and burn through every 
last cent for the future.

Dear Editor,
I write to correct an important 
error in the Oct. 29 front page 
article entitled  “Registration Fees 
Pulled from Student Services. ” 
The article mistakenly stated 
that, due to cutbacks in state funds, Student Affairs is channeling registration fees  toward areas nor-
mally funded by state funds, such as the Registrar’s Office, Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools, etc. 
This has not occurred. No such 
use of registration fees  is planned, 
at least on this campus. 
Student Affairs, supported by 
the Registration Fee Advisory Committee’s recommendations, has worked very hard in a difficult bud-getary environment to maintain the distinctive character of the registra-tion fee  for student co-curricular 
and developmental programs and services — not for core institutional or academic functions appropri-ate for the education fee and state 
funds. 
— Edward J. Spriggs
Associate Vice Chancellor, 
Student Affairs 
Dear Editor,
Both your editorial board and 
the A.S. Council seem a little con-fused. Why is it so offensive that the university will turn over your e-mails when the law requires it? 
When a judge issues a legal 
subpoena, you must comply or face punishment. When a judge issues a subpoena for student e-mails, the university is compelled by law to produce them. 
The “change” in ACS policy 
reflects the university’s existing legal duty to comply with subpoe-nas. It isn’t some conspiracy by Chancellor Marye Anne Fox to invade your privacy; if anything, the new language is the university’s way of letting you know exactly what your rights are. 
It’s a clarification, and not an 
unusual one. 
Gmail does the same thing: It 
will hand over your e-mails when an “applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmen-tal request” requires it (check www.
google.com/privacypolicy.html ). 
Y ahoo! Mail will also disclose your personal information when required to do so by law, or “in a good faith belief ” that disclosure is necessary to respond to claims that your e-mails violate the rights of third parties.
If you want to defy subpoenas 
and face jail time, design your own e-mail system and use it. Or move to Azerbaijan to escape the juris-diction of U.S. courts. But as long as you use an existing e-mail ser-vice provider in the United States, your e-mails will be subject to sub-poenas. Sorry.

in those high-waisted jeans?
What prevails throughout all gen-
erations is the idea that we don’t know what looks good on us until some kind of celebrity flaunts it on the red carpet. One week a muumuu-draped Mary-Kate Olsen gets eaten alive by the paparazzi in Greenwich Village, and the next a big-boned girl from Minnesota snatches an overpriced look-a-like sweater for no other rea-son than to do like the stars do. 
Truth is, there will always be hits 
and misses in the fashion world. Y et as much as our Friday night outfit-choosing ritual may be dictated by whatever Paris Hilton sported in her latest crotch shot (beyond the Brazilian wax), we also get to tai-lor our choices to work best on us. (I’m sure my mom thanked heaven for the big-haired ’80s movement — finally, something she could manage!) 
Re-browsing “My 
Mom, the Style Icon, ” I see women no more convinced of their own fashion sense than we are today, just trying to figure out what’s most stylish (and at least semi-comfortable) to slip on in the morning. In hindsight, I can’t really blame them for whipping out the Nancy Sinatra knee-highs — at least those are easier to slip into than 
skinny jeans.
As for me and my 
mom? We have differ-ent skin tones and face shapes, sure — but as for hair and body type, we’re one and the same. Scoff though I may at those shoulder-padded 
floral blazers collecting dust in the cobwebbed depths of Mom’s closet, I can’t guarantee I probably wouldn’t have made Jennifer Beals from “Flashdance” my style icon, too, had I been a working girl in the ’80s — spandex wedgie and all.

THE GREAT
DIVIDE
BY EDWIN GONZALEZ // FOCUS EDITOR
In the last 20 years, America’s political climate has hit 
a sweltering fever pitch. Political polarization is at an all-time high  — and political-science professor and researcher Gary Jacobson has the polls to prove it.
According to Jacobson, who has been conduct-
ing research on political polarization over the past 40 years, partisan politics are dictating elections and political decisions as moderate politicians are being forced to pick sides. Even if those partisan politics have recently begun to refuse compromise on progressive issues.
“I think Republican politicians have made a consid-
ered choice that their best choice in the long run is to just say ‘No’ [to progressive reforms] — to not respond — because their core supporters are not at all interested in support for [President Barack] Obama, ” Jacobson said.
Relying on data from commercial, academic and 
media polls gathered over the past decade, Jacobson synthesizes statistics to map out the Bush era in a broad historical context of pivotal events. 
 In response to pressure from ideologues, activists 
and fellow politicians, he argued, moderate Republicans and Democrats are gravitating to the most outspoken of their constituency. Six months after Obama’s inau-guration, the difference in approval ratings between self-identified Democratic and Republican voters (as measured by media polls) returned to similar levels of polarity as during President Bush’s tenure. As apparent in Obama’s current approval ratings, Congress is still heavily divided — and the gap only continues to widen. 
Sitting at a desk overcrowded with poll data and 
yellow notepads, peering from behind gold-framed tor-toiseshell glasses, Jacobson described his research with the subtle piquancy of a Congressional insider.
“In the last four years of the Bush administration 
… Bush’s approval among Democrats was in the single digits, ” Jacobson said. “That’s really low — nobody ever gets into the single digits. ”
Rather than advocating for more moderate eco-
nomic policies — a tactic many political hopefuls have employed — party polarization has led representatives to seek backing from their most solid base of support: liberal progressives and conservative fundamentalists.
According to Revelle College junior Alec Weisman, 
editor in chief of the California Review  — UCSD’s one 
politically conservative newspaper — a rise in bipar-tisanship is unlikely if Obama continues pursuing an agenda with which Republicans aren’t interested in associating. 
“I think if he had actually wanted to push biparti-
sanship, he should have stuck to the issues that were bipartisan, ” Weisman said.
After the economic collapse in 2007, presidential 
contender John McCain’s popularity fell in the polls, according to Weisman. And even with the momentum of his win — Obama still hit a speed bump when he began pushing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. According to Jacobson’s poll data, Obama’s An observation of the growing gaps in national income and widening politi-cal divisions across the country, Keith 
Poole’s “Polarized America” is a sociological investigation of partisan differences. 
Over the last three decades, U.S. income 
inequality has swelled to an unthinkable size and Poole — along with Princeton profes-sors Nolan McCarty and Howard Rosenthal — notes it sharply in his latest bookish prose ripe with time trends, financial statistics and footnotes. 
Although they begin by explaining their unique method of 
collecting data (a system they pioneered: collecting roll-call votes from both the Senate and the House), they plod through public policy like your everyday analyst for the greater part of the text.
Though the income gap has increased substantially, Poole 
argues, redistributive policies such as progressive taxing and welfare programs have been overwhelmed by voters unaffected by the inequity. Social issues such as immigration, he goes on to explain, have taken a dramatic toll on public opinion as well — especially when most voters agree that redistributive policies at the very least should not apply to illegal immigrants. 
In the end, Poole’s combination of economic analysis and 
social scrutiny puts a spotlight on prominent political disen-franchisement; shining a liberal light on the casualties of our nation’s obdurate opinions. POLARIZED AMERICA:

APR -09 MAY -09 JUN -09 JUL-09 AUG -09 SEP-09 OCT-09Without relying on Kitty Kelly’s grape-vine gossip or Oliver Stone’s simian caricatures, Gary Jacobson tackles 
George W . Bush’s eight-year reign with a pundit’s penchant for statistics. 
Democrats and Republicans alike had a 
tumultuous relationship with the commander in chief, and isn’t hard to see why as contro-versies seemed to surface every six months.
After Sept.11 and the capture of 
Saddam Hussein, Bush’s ratings floated on secondhand patri-otic highs — only to take a tumble after the levees broke in Louisiana and photos leaked from Abu Ghraib’s prisons. 
Unlike most books on Bush, Jacobson’s thoroughly aca-
demic chunk of research doesn’t dwell too long on political indictments — though you might still catch them, couched between to-the-point prose and hanging from line graphs.
Dour political tensions weren’t entirely Bush’s fault either, 
as Jacobson takes pains to explain in his first chapter. In 2000, Bush entered a political arena still seething from an inglorious 
impeachment trial less than a year before. And, to make mat-
ters worse, he rode in on the carcass of the Florida recount.
Whether you thought him an honest stalwart who stuck 
to his guns or a stubborn dolt without any political gump-tion, Jacobson’s plethora of polls and surveys create a collec-tive canvas hard to dismiss as sheer liberal bias.A DIVIDER, NOT A UNITER:

LA JOLLA ECOLOGICAL RESERVE
SITESEEN
THE BOTTOM LINEWithout a ride, escaping UCSD for a little slice of the 
natural world is a daunting and exhausting task. But if you man up, flash your Free Bus Zone sticker and ride 
the MTS bus route 30 a mere five stops south of campus, you’ll find yourself dumped breezily into the famed La Jolla Ecological Reserve. Established in the 1970s, the reserve spans 6,000 under-water acres off of La Jolla Shores — ripe with sandy flats, kelp beds and underwater canyons. 
A far cheaper alternative to Sea World, the reserve is teeming 
with sea life ranging from guitarfish and stingrays to dolphins and sharks. It’s even home to a series of caves — a main attrac-tion for snorkelers brave enough to flipper through a dark grotto or two.
The less daring, however, can try their hand at kayaking or 
paddleboarding. Y ou might encounter a scary wave or two on the way out, but they’ll make for some excellent surf on the way back. Feel free to get creative: Take a blow-up floaty or scramble down the cliff side and jump right into the water.
La Jolla’s seven caves — dubbed the White Lady, Little Sister, 
Shopping Cart, Sea Surprise, Arch Cave, Sunny Jim’s Cave and Clam’s Cave are hidden within a 75-million-year-old sandstone sea cliff. Poke around a little and you might even stumble upon some treasure — those pesky out-of-towners have been known to forget a digital camera or two.
Take advantage of these last few rays of sunshine before 
finals strike: Water visibility peaks at over 30 feet down, where sea animals are hankering for some swimming buddies. Y ou’ll 
find leopard sharks hanging out by the La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club and sea lions guarding the entrance to the caves. And with the rush of tourist season coming to a close, you might just get them all to yourself.

Contributing WriterThough it may seem like you’ve run out of useless skills to learn — having mastered DJ Hero and the dance routine in the latest “Single Ladies” video), you might be tempted to pick 
up a hobby that doesn’t require gyrating your pelvis for 20 straight minutes.
Despite the fact that it may seem a little out of your grasp.Not so, said Muir College sophomore Clay Johnson, a principal 
member of the Muir College Juggling Club. 
Started in 2006 by UCSD alumnus Kevin Nazario, the organiza-
tion has one noble goal: to spread the art of juggling to all those 
willing to try — whether you’re looking to refine estab-lished skills or stumbling in as a three-ball virgin. 
According 
to Johnson, it usually only takes 15 min-utes to learn the 
basics, and the rest comes naturally after a few weeks of messing around. 
“There’s a lot of people starting out, ” Johnson said. “Each meet-
ing, people who are walking by come up to us and they just want to learn. ” 
Club leaders provide one-on-one help to all their members, the 
majority of whom are new and can only juggle only three or four balls. Johnson himself holds the distinction of keeping the most clubs in the air simultaneously: an impressive eight. 
Apart from solo ball-tossing acts, the club also encourages part-
ner and group work. Its most entertaining trick is a mesmerizing eight-club hot potato toss between two people. 
Muir College Juggling Club has received a plethora of fanfare 
over the years, from being photographed by passersby to per-forming at Muirstock 2009. The club will be performing at Muir’s annual festival again this spring in addition to attending juggling galas like the Los Angeles Nomadic Juggling Festival this Saturday, Nov. 14.
The club’s meeting times change every quarter. However, for 
the rest of fall, you can find them every Wednesday from 3:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sun God Lawn (in front of the Applied Physics & Mathematics Building). Johnson invites you to drop by — because who knows? Within 15 minutes, you could be on your way to developing a not-so-hidden talent.

STARTING THIS COMING FRIDAY!STARTING THIS COMING FRIDAY!
College students have been going to T ommy’ s since 1946 for the 
greatest burger in L.A., possibily the world. If  you haven’t been 
to Original T ommy’ s World Famous Hamburgers you’ re missing 
a big part of  the college experience.
7415 Clairemont Mesa Blvd. www.originaltommys.comGive Us the Old College Try . WORLD FAMOUS HAMBURGERSShortly after introducing the bill, the 
president’s approval ratings among Republicans began to suffer. 
One key difference from previ-
ous years, however, was that political protestors were focusing more on economic issues than social ones.
According to Weisman, the 
conservative party is going back to its roots. He said that many fiscal conservatives were disenchanted with then-President George W . Bush after he crafted his 2008 stimulus bill; as a result, they’ve begun to support more hard-line candidates. And, considering summer rallies, he predicts a new wave of conservative activism could be upon us. 
“I think the right is starting to 
stand up, ” Weisman said.
This past summer, as activ-
ists known as Tea Party Patriots marched through DC and the Senate Judiciary Committee vetted then-Supreme Court nominee Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Jacobson was updating his 2006 book A Divider, 
Not a Uniter: George W . Bush and the American People. Based on new polls from the final three year’s of Bush’s presidency, Jacobson analyzed the evolution of Bush’s partisan upshot. 
 “We thought [political polar-
ization] had peaked with [former President Bill Clinton’s] impeach-ment, which was an incredibly par-tisan division that [Congress] had to vote on, ” Jacobson said. “But we thought it was over, and then Bush gets elected through Florida. ”
Though Clinton’s impeachment 
trial was a pivotal benchmark for political polarization in the U.S., Jacobson’s 2006 book explains that the concept isn’t by any means a recent phenomenon. 
According to Jacobson, politi-
cal polarization has swelled from social issues since the 1960s — most specifically, after the Goldwater cam-paign in ’64.
Jacobson has charted correla-
tions between party identification and positions on icy issues. Based on voter surveys, since 1972, the steep-est increases in polarization have been over more touchy social issues such as welfare, affirmative action and abortion. According to Jacobson, 25 years 
ago, one’s opinions about abortion were unrelated to his or her identi-fication as a Republican. In fact, he said, Republicans tended to be more pro-choice. Y et by 2004, 63 per-cent of self-identified Republicans thought abortion should be illegal under all circumstances — compared to only 34 percent of Democrats.
Keith Poole, another political-
science professor at UCSD, has con-ducted similar research on political polarization. By analyzing roll-call vote patterns — the recorded “Y ea” or 
“Nay” votes on proposed legislation used by Congress — Poole, along with two other researchers, has found that the gap between congressio-nal parties has been expanding. 
In plac-
ing the roll-call vote from each member of Congress on a liberal-to-conservative spectrum, Poole and 
his collaborators concluded that Republicans are increasingly more conservative as Democrats more liberal. 
Of course, there are also other 
popular explanations for these par-tisan divisions that Jacobson said he’s taken into account — one being increasingly biased news sources. 
“There’s definitely been height-
ened polarization, especially with the 24/7 news cable coverage that’s going on nonstop, ” Marshall College junior and President of the College Democrats at UCSD Victor Lin said. “Y ou have all the talking heads going on every hour of every day. ”
Debate over the Obama admin-
istration’s recent tussle with the Fox 
News network mirrors a similar dilemma at UCSD. Though the California Review  boasts many 
moderate members, its articles don’t always reflect the opinions of the moderately conservative. 
“When you look at the California 
Review  and you look at the rest of 
the on-campus environment, there needs to be someone to put out a more conservative position because there are currently two liberal news-papers and then there’s the Guardian  
— which, in a lot of cases, does veer left, ” Weisman said.
 (Weisman added that a wider 
breadth of views is available to read on the student organization’s blog, www.ucsdcalreview.wordpress.com .)
Though much of Jacobson’s 
research has indicated that politi-cal polarization is on the rise, many politically active students — on the right and left — are bridging the gap with open dialogue.
Lin admitted that if there is any 
difference between the national Democratic Party and the College Democrats at UCSD, it’s probably that the students lean more to left.
At a recent debate between the 
College Democrats at UCSD and College Republicans over same-sex marriage, the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy and the stimulus bill, Lin said he was surprised that many young conservatives were willing to admit that some traditional conservative positions are flawed.
“When it came to ‘don’t ask, don’t 
tell, ’ most of [the Republicans] were supportive of repealing that, ” Lin said. 
According to Weisman, most 
moderates are politically apathetic. But he said he still believes that com-promise is key if we want to escape the cycle of presidential referendums.
“Polarization is completely an elite 
phenomenon: [It] is among the activ-ists and pundits and the politicians — whereas the rest of the population is not divided in the same way, ” said Jacobson. “ And there’s some truth to that. The people who are the least divided are the people who are the least involved in politics — the least knowledgeable about politics. ”

The Tritons — who had never before lost to San Francisco State — dropped a Nov. 6 match to the Gators that ended their season-best 16-game win streak. Only

On Nov. 7, the Tritons improved

work pay dividends in the 53rd minute, when the Tritons tied the match at 1-1. The equalizer came when a shot by sophomore mid-fielder Shelby Wong was deflected back into the box, giving freshman midfielder Jessica Wi the chance to charge in and punch the ball past the Toro goalkeeper for her fourth goal of the season. Wong was cred-ited with the assist — her fifth of 2009.
After Wi’s game-tying goal, both 
teams continued to battle closely; neither surrendered a goal through-out the remainder of regulation. With the match tied 1-1 at the final whistle, both teams geared up for a 10-minute overtime period. 
“Everybody was tired, ” Wethe 
said. “Everybody was looking to dig deep and pull through for their teammates by scoring a goal and ending the game. ”After the first overtime period 
played out to a scoreless draw, the game moved into a second 10-min-ute overtime. After both teams were blanked once again, the match moved into penalty kicks to decide who would advance to the confer-ence championship.
Cal State Dominguez Hills elect-
ed to shoot first after winning the coin toss, and the Toros buried their first shot. The Tritons’ first shooter, Wethe, sailed her kick too high and to the right, giving Dominguez a 1-0 lead after the first round.
The next three penalty kicks 
were successful on both sides: junior midfielder Lisa Bradley, sophomore midfielder  Sara Bolton and fresh-man forward Alyssa Newcomer all found the net for UCSD, setting up the decisive Dominguez Hill shot.
The fifth and final shooter 
for the Toros went right, beating Armstrong for the decisive penalty kick to seal the victory.
Despite the loss, UCSD held a 
13-10 shot advantage in the match, including a 3-1 edge in shots on goal. The Tritons totaled six corner kicks, while the Toros finished with two. 
“I thought we played extreme-
ly well, especially in the second half, ” head coach Brian McManus said. “Y ou’ve got to give Dominguez credit. They were very well-pre-pared, and they had an excellent plan if it went to [penalty kicks]. We missed one shot and that was the difference. ”
In the other matches in the 
CCAA Championships, No. 1 seed Cal State Los Angeles defeated No. 4 seed Chico State 1-0. The Golden Eagles then defeated Cal State Dominguez Hills on Nov. 8 by a score of 4-0 to capture the CCAA Championship and earn an auto-matic birth into the NCAA West Regionals.

Nguyen’s experience in the champi-onship will aid UCSD in facing off against Azusa Pacific University in the Tritons’ second match of the 2010 spring season.
In the second day of the tour-
nament, Placek lost to USD’s Charl Wolmarans 6-0, 6-1. Junior Erik 
Elliot, who had already received an 
automatic berth into the main draw, lost a close match to UC Irvine’s Stephen Stege 6-4, 6-4. Fellow was likewise unsuccessful in his Round of 32 match. He fell to UCLA ’s Holden Seguso 6-2, 6-0.
When the tournament’s doubles 
competition got underway Thursday afternoon, the Tritons proved equally 
unsuccessful against their Division-I 
competitors. 
Fellow and Ling lost to UC 
Riverside duo Quoc Doan and Felix Marcherez 8-2. Sophomore Chapman Chan and Placek suffered a defeat against UC Irvine’s Fabian Matthews and Shimpei Suzuki 8-2. Junior Armaun Emami and freshman Austin West, who were crowned ITA West Region Doubles Champions and put on a strong performance at the ITA National Champions, lost a close contest  against LMU’s Renzo 
Maggi and Malet 8-5.
The Tritons fared slightly better in 
their singles matchups on day three of the tournament, as Nguyen edged past UC Santa Barbara’s Finkelstein — one of the Gauchos’ best players — in a tough 7-6, 6-3 matchup. 
After a back-and-forth third-
round match, Ling eventually grabbed a victory against UC Irvine’s Zac Tsai. 
After Ling lost the first set to Tsai 
6-2, he went on to win the second set 6-3, forcing a tiebreaker. 
Ling took the match after a 10-4 
tiebreaker, advancing to Saturday’s semifinals to face Azusa Pacific University’s Janosch Apelt.
Day three for the Tritons also 
saw Fellow lose his match against Pepperdine University’s Fanselow 7-6, 6-1, and Placek enter another tie-breaking set only to lose 6-7, 6-0 (10-5) — the official end of their run in the Southern California 
Intercollegiate Championship.
In the tournament’s final round on 
Nov. 7, Nguyen faced Azusa Pacific’s Janosch Apelt in the semifinals of the singles qualifying back draw and was quickly swept 6-0, 6-0. 
Ling defeated UC Riverside’s 
Quoc Doan to set up his champion-ship match with Apelt. 
Apelt, a transfer student from 
Germany, had few problems defeat-ing Ling — and took the qualifying back-draw title with 6-2 and 6-0 wins. 
“[Ling] played well, ” Steidlmayer 
said. “It was a good tournament for him overall. He took on some tough opponents — especially today with Apelt. That’s the way it goes. ” 
The Tritons’ appearance at the 
Southern California Intercollegiate Championship concludes a men’s fall schedule that included three open tournaments but no team competi-tions. UCSD returns to action for its spring season on Feb. 1, when it hosts Concordia Irvine.

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL —  With a 
resounding thud at the end of a forgetta-
ble Friday night, the No. 2 UCSD women’s volleyball team suffered its second loss of the season. 
The fall to the San Francisco State 
Gators on Nov. 6 ended a string of 16 straight Triton victories. Despite 20 kills from senior captain outside hitter Sylvia Schmidt, the Tritons were not able to over-come 41 kills delivered by San Francisco’s top two hitters. It was the Tritons’ first ever loss to the Gators, who are vying for a wildcard playoff spot into the NCAA 
regional tournament.
Early in the first set, the Tritons kept 
pace with the Gators, holding the game 
within one point for most of the set before San Francisco went on a 12-5 run to take a commanding 18-10 lead. The Tritons could not pull within more than four points through the rest of the set, and the Gators finished it off 25-19.
UCSD came out fast in the second 
set, pushing ahead for most of the match behind an impressive performance by senior captain setter Elaine Chen. The Gators did not get closer than within five points of the Tritons, and Schmidt put the set away with a kill at 25-16.
After halftime, the Gators gained 
some first-set style play. With a persistent attack and few errors, the Gators went on a mid-set run to a 20-12 lead, then cruised through the rest of the set to take a 25-15 vic-tory.
In the fourth set, neither 
team could pull away from the other, and the squads battled head to head. The Gators took a match point lead at 24-23, but a kill from 
Schmidt and an ace by Chen 
gave the Tritons their first set point. 
Unfortunately for UCSD, 
the Gator offense soon deliv-ered a kill to stop their run. The Tritons took three more set points, but each one was followed either by a service error or a Gator kill. When 
San Francisco State had its 
second opportunity at match point, they took full advan-tage with a block that sealed the upset victory.
“We’re really clear on [what] we need 
to get better at, ” head coach Tom Black said. “We know what we need to work on. ”
Despite the defeat, the Tritons sand-wiched their loss with two three-game sweeps against Cal State East Bay, and against Cal State Monterey Bay, on Nov. 4 and 7. The victory against the Monterey Bay Otters brought UCSD’s season record to 26-2, tying Black’s all-time record for wins in a single season.
“There’s a sense of urgency now, ” 
Black said. “We’re getting into the home stretch. So we want to take care of the patches and focus now as we’re getting into the playoffs. ”
On Nov. 4, the Tritons 
cruised to a victory over the Cal State East Bay Pioneers, showing solid offense through-out the match by notching a team .316 hitting percentage. Redshirt freshman middle blocker Julia Freidenberg hit at 
a .500 clip and picked up eight 
kills on the night, as Schmidt added nine kills of her own. Sophomore outside hitter Katie Condon had four kills in the first set — her only set of the night.
“We have a lot of depth 
on our team, ” Schmidt said. 
“I think that Tom [Black] was trying 
to get everyone an opportunity to play 
tonight. ”

WOMEN’S SOCCER —  The UCSD women’s 
soccer team tied 1-1 with Cal State Dominguez Hills on Nov. 6  in the opening round of the 2009 California Collegiate  Athletic Association 
Women’s Soccer Championship. However, after battling No. 2 seed Cal State Dominguez Hills to a 1-1 draw through regulation and two overtime periods, the No. 3 seed Tritons were eliminated from the tournament in a 5-3 penalty kick shoot-out.
UCSD now has a record of 14-5-1 and 
awaits Monday’s announcement of the NCAA Tournament field to see if its season will con-tinue.
“The plan was the same as it had been in 
previous matches, ” sophomore midfielder Anne Wethe said. “To come out and pass the ball, get open and play hard. ”
The Toros drew first blood in the hard-fought 
contest, seizing a 1-0 lead in the 35th minute when a free kick from 35 yards went over the head of Triton sophomore goalkeeper Kristin Armstrong.
“Obviously no one wants to be behind in a 
game, ” Wethe said. “I think the general feeling of the team was that we weren’t out of the game at all, that we were going to come back and score. ”
The Toros attempted four shots in the first 
half. Of those attempts, the fourth and final shot was the only that found its way into the net. In contrast, the Tritons fielded a more aggressive offense, taking five shots and four corner kicks. Nonetheless, the Toros maintained a 1-0 lead at =+;,8IQZ

MEN’S TENNIS —  The UCSD 
men’s tennis team held its own at the 53rd annual Southern California Intercollegiate Championships from Nov. 4 to Nov. 7, despite entering a competition stocked full of Division-I opponents.
“ As a team, we preformed well 
and at a high level, ” head coach Eric Steidlmayer said. “Going into the next season, we need to be the best com-petitors. There were teams in the competition that did that, and we need to take that [mentality] and win every match. ” 
In the qualifying rounds on Nov. 
4, sophomore Jake Fellow beat UC Santa Barbara’s Josh Finkelstein 2-6, 6-2 (10-4). However, in the following round, Fellow lost to UCLA ’s Alex Brigham 6-2, 6-2.
Redshirt junior Alex Placek 
advanced to the Round of 32 due to his first opponent’s withdrawal from the tournament. 
Placek then breezed past Loyola 
Marymount University’s Nick Vonderahe 6-2, 6-1, advancing to face his next opponent on Nov. 5: University of San Diego’s Charl Worlmarans.
In UCSD’s other opening-round 
matchups, LMUs Otto Sauer defeated sophomore Sam Ling 6-1, 6-0; junior Vincent Nguyen lost to Borja Malet of LMU 4-6, 7-6 (10-3); and redshirt freshman Austin West lost to UCLA ’s Ahmed Ismail 6-4, 6-0.
Ling and Nguyen made amends 
for their Wednesday losses the fol-lowing day by rebounding with a pair of solid victories against two fresh-men from Azusa Pacific University. 
Ling defeated Pacific’s Ilja 
Ikannikov 6-0, 6-4, while Nguyen took his match against Whitman
