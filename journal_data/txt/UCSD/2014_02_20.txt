An undergraduate UC Berkeley 
student may have exposed San 
Francisco metro passengers to the 
measles virus, according to public 
health officials. The unnamed stu -
dent is reported to have taken Bay 
Area Rapid Transit in Contra Costa 
County and attended classes at UC 
Berkeley before being diagnosed 
with the illness.
Officials confirmed that the stu -
dent was not vaccinated and con -
tracted the illness during a recent 
trip abroad.
The measles virus can remain 
airborne for up to two hours, poten -tially affecting anyone who used 
BART between Feb. 4 and Feb. 7 in 
the early morning and late evening 
hours.
No further cases have been 
reported in conjunction with the 
student, but officials urge anyone 
who may be experiencing symp -
toms to immediately seek medical 
attention.
Measles often presents itself as a 
high fever and rash across the face 
and neck approximately one to three 
weeks after the initial exposure. If 
untreated, complications, such as 
swelling of the brain and dehydra -
tion, can lead to death.SHAKE SPEARE

Drastic reforms to A.S. Council bylaws have 
stalled, and will possibly be discharged, after 
three of the six college councils chose through 
a vote not to ratify changes to the A.S. constitution. The 
changes, which were drafted by the Bylaws Committee 
and passed by A.S. Council in Fall Quarter 2013, 
needed to be ratified by four out of six colleges needed 
to pass and become part of the constitution. Instead, the 
standing rules, which A.S. Council passed in Week 3 of 
Winter Quarter 2014, have been amended to match the 
current constitution.
One highly contested change was replacing the 
elected position of VP Finance and Resources with 
an appointed Financial Controller position. Another 
change would make Academic Division Senators non-
voting members of A.S. Council but voting members 
on their own Academic Representatives Council, add two International Senators, add one more Transfer 
Senator and cut one First Y ear Senator position. Both 
of these amendments failed.
Thurgood Marshall College Student Council and 
the Student Council of Eleanor Roosevelt College, or 
SCERC, failed the constitution in its entirety, while 
Student Council of Sixth College, or SCSC, passed 
certain amendments and failed others. Members of the 
Bylaws Committee said they were surprised by because 
they asked for feedback from the college councils when 
amending the constitution during Fall Quarter 2013.
“I can’t help but feeling a little bit disappointed, 
especially with the colleges that voted everything 
down, ” Social Sciences Senator and Bylaws Committee 
member Colin King said. “I don’t see a valid reason for

UCSD received $362 million in

from the $394.98 million that the university received in 2012. However, 
UCSD received a total of 847 awards 
in 2013 versus 802 in 2012.
The online newsletter places Johns 
Hopkins as the first institution and UC 
San Francisco in second — the latter is 
the only other UC on the list.

almost necessary. It makes me feel at 
least personally attacked, and like there 
was some different motive than just to 
put A.S. in check. ”
ERC Senator Chris Klein said 
he believes this other motive might 
be college councils wishing to spite 
A.S. Council. He claims that relations 
between college councils and A.S. 
Council have been “petty” for the past 
year, with tensions arising primarily 
over college council back-funding. 
Some of the suspicion of college 
councils’ possible ulterior motives come 
from secrecy surrounding SCERC’s 
voting on the constitution. Klein said 
that SCERC members initially asked 
lots of questions when he presented 
the constitution amendments at 
SCERC’s weekly meeting during Week 
4. The next week, however, when he 
brought Bylaws Committee members 
A.S. President Andy Buselt and AVP 
Academic Affairs Robby Boparai to 
answer questions, SCERC asked no 
questions and tabled voting to the 
next week. The following week, Buselt 
and VP Finance and Resources Sean 
O’Neal returned to the weekly meeting 
to answer questions, but SCERC 
Vice President Aman Joea motioned 
to move into an executive session, 
imposing that only of SCERC members 
could be allowed in the meeting.
The executive session effectively 
removed Buselt and O’Neal from the room and resulted in no documentation 
of who voted for what in the meeting. 
However, an executive session is not a 
part of SCERC bylaws, and, according 
to Robert’s Rules of Order, are only 
warranted within reason. A closed 
session, which is virtually the same as 
an executive session except that it can 
be requested at any time, is written in 
SCERC bylaws. Because Joea motioned 
for an executive session instead of a 
closed session, Klein asserted that 
technically, the information should 
be made public. He said he did not 
think this would happen, but noted 
that many of the concerns were 
reflective of what was said during 
A.S. Council meetings.
“I think people would be 
surprised by the open hostility and 
lack of trust between SCERC and 
A.S., ” Klein said. “They had already 
set their minds on saying no. ”
SCERC is apparently equally 
suspicious of A.S. Council. A SCERC 
member who spoke to the Guardian 
on condition of anonymity said that 
SCERC distrusted A.S. Council because 
of a perceived lack of transparency; 
however, they were not willing to let 
A.S. Council answer questions because 
of a lack of trust. Because much of the 
Bylaws Committee was comprised of 
the Keep it Real slate members, the 
source said, some SCERC members 
suspected that the constitution changes 
were an attempt to keep that slate 
in power. However, the constitution 
amendments actually mandated that college and academic senators run 
independent of slates, meaning that a 
maximum of 11 candidates could run 
on one slate. The source was unaware 
of this component of the amendments 
and suspected that much of SCERC 
was also unaware.
According to the SCERC member, 
the biggest opposition to the 
amendments was the change from VP 
Student Life to VP Campus Affairs, but 
SCERC believed that the changes to 
the position would make it too much 
responsibility for one person to hold. 
However, because SCSC passed this 
amendment along with Muir College 
Council, Revelle College Council and 
W arren College Student Council, it will 
be in effect for this upcoming election.
Sixth College Senator Allison 
Bagnol agreed that SCSC’s decision 
to fail half of the constitutional 
amendments was based on SCSC’s 
relationship with A.S. Council and not 
on the content of the constitution.
“ A.S. is oftentimes seen as 
purely issue-based, purely political, 
and purely bullshit, ” Bagnol said. 
“College councils are seen as purely 
programming- and event-based. It 
seems like anything from A.S., from 
the college councils’ perspective, has 
negative connotations. ”
She furthered that the decision was 
probably made with the needs of SCSC 
in mind, and not the needs of SCSC’s 
Sixth College constituents.
The Bylaws Committee had hoped 
to put the constitutional changes to a student vote as a referendum on 
the spring ballot in order to bypass 
ratification by more than three councils. 
However, while potential referendum 
language received a majority vote in 
A.S. Council, it did not cross the three-
fourths vote threshold it needed to be 
put to a student vote during this year’s 
election cycle.
“We felt that [the change] was very 
reactionary, because this proposed 
change to the ratification process came 
a week or two after we had failed their 
proposed changes, ” Marshall Senator 
Kathleen Maguire said. “It didn’t 
feel like they had been looking at a 
historical problem and then seeking to 
alleviate it. ”
Although many of the biggest 
changes will not be implemented 
for this year’s elections, the Bylaws 
Committee is hopeful that those 
amendments can be amended and 
passed in the future in order to best 
represent and serve the student body.
“We really looked shameful 
yesterday from the outside, ” Bagnol 
said. “If I was a regular student 
looking at A.S. talking about bylaws 
for hours on end, I would feel really 
unrepresented and undervalued, and 
that’s just a big problem. I think it 
really stunted a lot of the productivity 
and projects and issues that I think are 
far more important than what we’re 
talking about now. ”2 THE UCSD  GUARDIAN  | THURSDAY , FEBRUARY  20, 2014 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  NE WS

FLEETING THOUGHTS By Irene Chiang
RAINY FRIDAY S By Eunice Ho
Last night’s council meeting was 
sad and lonely due to the absence of 
my usual companion, A.S. meeting live 
blogger Hannah Bernabe. It also meant I 
couldn’t refer to her notes when I tuned 
out. However, I was remarkably involved 
in last night’s council meeting. It began 
with (surprise!) a shout-out from Kyle 
Heiskala.
“I don’t know if any of you noticed, 
but last week was the first week I didn’t 
speak here, ” Heiskala said. “But it’s okay, 
because Gabriella also wasn’t there to 
report on it. ”
Physical Sciences Senator Sierra 
Donaldson apparently did not notice 
my absence, however, and called the 
Guardian out — cough, cough — for 
reporting on her excitement for her 
event last week instead of the event 
itself. Well, I will do her justice and let 
you all know that her event, which hap -
pens on March 10, will highlight women 
in physical sciences on March 10 and 
will feature own physics professor, 
Alison Coil.
Later in the night, VP Finance Sean 
O’Neal turned all the way around and 
waved at me while advertising for his 
Foosh event. Is this what it feels like to be popular?
VP Student Life Linda Le reported 
that she attended SDSU’s student gov -
ernment’s divestment meeting this week.
“If you think our A.S. is structured 
crazy, well, their A.S. is structured even 
more crazy, so you can ask me about 
that, ” Le said.
A resolution to impeach Mio White 
was tabled indefinitely following her res -
ignation earlier this week.
Three ad hoc task forces were cre -
ated this week. One was a committee 
that would focus on improving relations 
between A.S. Council and the six college 
councils. This led to a passive-aggressive 
back-and-forth between AVP College 
Affairs Meena Kaushik and Social 
Sciences Senator Colin King. The high 
point came when King read out the 
bylaws of Kaushik’s job description.
Although the committee was origi -
nally to be a voting one, that line was 
amended to make it a non-voting com -mittee following a valid comment from 
O’Neal: “Since these relations are mostly 
dealing with emotions, I don’t think the 
voting process is appropriate. ”
The second committee to be 
formed was one overseeing council 
reserves, while the third is a commit -
tee to restructure tradition events. 
Tradition events currently receive 
special treatment, and they fall far 
outside of budgetary guidelines set by 
the UC Office of the President. This 
committee is intended to analyze and 
appropriately adjust tradition events.
Campuswide Senator Jordan 
Coburn asserted that sincerely 
reaching out to college councils and 
expressing appreciation for them 
could make notable strides in solving 
relations between A.S. Council and 
the college councils.
I wish her idea could work, but given 
my recent revelations about inter-coun -
cil animosities, my hopes aren’t high. If 
you’re wondering what I mean, please 
refer to my long-ass article that starts on 
page 1. Extra props if you read all the 
way through.
With that remark, the meeting came 
to a timely close. Until next week!Council Forms Three New Task Forces, Mio White Resigns

4  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | T HURSDAY , F EBRUARY 20, 2014 | WWW. UCSDGUARDIAN .ORG 
A few weeks back, we wrote the 
kindest editorial we’ve ever 
written about the current 
A.S. Council, commending them for 
their tremendous work in putting 
together a highlight reel-worthy list 
of bylaw reforms that would increase 
accountability and responsibility while 
empowering student voters.
A.S. Council needed ratification 
by four college councils to enact the 
bylaws, which would limit slate sizes 
and ban academic senators from 
running on slates inclined toward 
partisan politics. But only three col -
leges voted to ratify.
The setback, the result of 
impasses in ERC, Marshall and 
Sixth, damages this A.S. Council’s 
best hope for a positive legacy. 
Additionally, the effective “fili -
buster” raises our suspicions that 
someone(s) may be trying to put 
together a so-called “Super Slate” 
reminiscent of 2013’s Keep it Real. 
Another super slate-dominated 
election would prove problematic 
for yet another election cycle.
Super slate politics on campus 
tend to yield strong results for those 
on board. 2012 saw Meggie Le’s 
“Ride the Tide” slate dominate A.S. 
and several college councils’ rosters, 
and members from President Andy 
Buselt’s Keep it Real hold much of Sixth and Muir College councils 
as well as much of the current A.S. 
Council. There’s no denying that 
super-slate candidates just have 
more visibility — everyone remem -
bers Keep it Real’s turquoise shirts 
facing off against One Voice’s purple 
last spring. This slate “branding” 
allows super slate members to boost 
their campaigns, and it benefits 
those running for specific college 
positions and those campaigning 
campuswide. When college senators 
join a slate, they get their college on 
board and often yield higher turn -
outs for single-slate voting.
Super slates are the best way for 
power-seekers to manipulate the 
current election bylaws to put as 
many candidates as possible in office 
— but often lost in this process are 
the true evaluations of whether a 
candidate will be an effective stu -
dent leader. Voters tend to choose 
the most attractive candidates or 
vote for members of a single slate 
— and admittedly, it is easy to log 
on and just click on the cute ones or 
the ones wearing purple. And only 
the most informed do this — the 
majority of students just skip voting 
entirely due to lack of information. 
In fact, A.S. council voter turnout 
during the 2013 elections was at a 
dismal 22 percent.The Guardian publishes an 
annual endorsement list that is 
entirely based on our interviews with 
all candidates for campuswide sena -
tors, the president and the three vice 
presidents. However, most students 
on this campus don’t have the same 
sort of access to candidates. Unless 
they read our election endorsements, 
most students are left to assess can -
didates largely based on publicity 
or who had the cutest puppies on 
Library Walk. Some college council -
members expressed discontent with 
A.S. Council’s lack of transparency 
in reforming the bylaws, but we don’t 
see why they’re putting up a fight to 
prevent what we believe is truly pro -
gressive change.
Why college councils are stall -
ing bylaw reform is so far unknown 
— rumors have circulated that 
college councils are tired of work -
ing with what they see as a dic -
tatorial A.S. Council. Though it’s 
too late for this election, college 
councils would do well to realize 
that A.S. Council’s reforms are in 
fact intended to make candidates 
more accountable to their collective 
constituencies and less accountable 
to their slates. It’s about time that, 
once and for all, college councils 
need work with A.S. Council to kill 
the super slate.Happiness 
Means
Splurging
Sometimes
As someone who gets a cheap 
thrill from pilfering napkins 
from Chipotle and ration -
ing out leftovers to last for three 
subsequent meals, I’ d say I could be 
considered a “poor college student. ” 
Y esterday, however, all my vows of 
frugality became temporarily irrel -
evant as I splurged on something 
wildly unnecessary and far beyond 
my typical spending range. But, I’ve 
come to terms with the realization 
that indulging yourself every now and 
then is a perfectly healthy and accept -
able behavior.
I had been eyeing a particular 
red saffiano leather handbag for 
weeks before I was alerted that last 
week’s 25-percent-off sale would 
lower the price to $250. This put me 
into a state of internal turmoil — 
the price was still high but no longer 
out of the question. I struggled with 
the knowledge that $250 is more 
than a week’s worth of my paycheck, 
two-point-five times the amount I 
paid for my iPhone and well over 
the price of a round-trip plane 
ticket home. Ignoring my already 
large collection of purses, I racked 
my brain for an occasion in recent 
memory that would merit such a 
reward. (There was none — making 
it to my 9 a.m. class only impressed 
myself.) I even labeled my hours of 
obsessive purse-stalking as “research 
for my column” and, therefore, a 
productive use of my time.
This process of self-justifica -
tion was comically useless, and I 
was only bickering with myself. 
Everyone is entitled to their own 
happiness. There’s a difference 
between practicing sound, per -
sonal financial skills and depriving 
yourself of needed gratification. I’ll 
never fully understand how one of 
my aunts can shell out thousands 
of dollars on fine dining that will 
only end up travelling through our 
digestive tracts, but I respect that 
we each have our own spending 
priorities, whether that’s on a three-
star Michelin meal or a nice haircut. 
Long after any Burberry trench 
coat or Hermès Birkin bag wears 
out, she’ll have the memory of the 
champagne-dipped king prawns we 
shared at the Four Seasons’ Lung 
King Heen — and that makes her 
happy. With disregard to whether 
an item of choice is fast fashion, 
completely impractical or an eye -
sore to the greater public like the 
ceramic dog statue Joey bought 
himself after getting a role on “Days 
of Our Lives, ” everyone deserves to 
treat themselves once in a while. We 
can’t postpone the fulfillment of all 
things enjoyable for a financially 
stable future that may or may not 
materialize.
If you don’t ever spoil yourself, 
you might find yourself haunted 
— both literally and figuratively as 
online ad tracking algorithms are 
getting smarter — by images of the 
unpurchased items, so much that 
you resort to buying poor facsimiles 
of the original to fill the void of what 
could have been. So splurge on that 
one ridiculous item you’ve been 
thirsting after, savor that feeling of 
guiltless satisfaction and stop look -
ing like Grumpy Cat. I myself will be 
beginning a happy life with my new 
sartorial companion (well, in three 
to five business days).

As a green and environmentally sustainable university, UCSD should look 
to create a water conservation plan in light of  California’s recent drought.
ILLUSTRATION BY JENNY PARK
Last week, President Obama visited California to discuss the 
drought. Out of all the beautiful beaches, mountain resorts and 
cities he could have chosen to take his wife to for V alentine’s Day, 
the commander in chief picked a farm near Firebaugh —which is about 
as impressive as it sounds.
Despite the snickering, the visit was well placed. Firebaugh is 
part of California’s Central Valley, an expansive agricultural region 
that feeds the whole country. Billboards around the valley have 
long warned that a water crisis was imminent, reminding us “food 
grows where water flows. ” The president’s visit signals a national 
concern for our state’s water crisis. Going into a third dry year, 
with the Colorado River’s levels dipping dangerously low, northern 
California cities have already begun limiting water use, and many 
analysts believe statewide rationing isn’t far off. 
The drought is an interesting political issue because at its heart, it’s not a political issue at all. There is no gridlock to break and no bill 
to pass that will make rain happen. Instead of Governor Jerry Brown 
standing outside the Capitol attempting a rain dance, the solution to 
our water woes is to bring awareness to just how much water we waste 
and what we can do to start conserving right away.
UC President Janet Napolitano recently asked that the system 
save an additional 20 percent of its water, and we at the Guardian 
believe that UCSD is in a unique position to lead in this initiative. As 
a campus, we pride ourselves on our sustainability efforts, having all 
but banned plastic water bottles and relying on our own electricity 
microgrid that produces over 90 percent of the university’s power. With 
collaboration between the students and the administration, it’s entirely 
within our reach to come up with a water sustainability plan as well.
Last year, the city of San Diego eased restrictions on greywater sys -
tems, paving the way for homes to use the recycled water from chores

Though a university-wide greywater 
system is an enormous and expensive 
task, it is perhaps worth looking into 
as a way to keep our campus green, in 
every sense of the word.

use on a daily basis. Those hundreds 
of gallons of water a day contribute to 
the almost 800 million gallons UCSD 
uses every year. Just as we’ve been 
conditioned to turn the light off as we 
leave a room, we should make turn -
ing the faucet off while we brush our 
teeth a habit as well.
San Diego County is lucky in many ways, as we get a significant 
portion of our water from the 
Metropolitan Water District of 
Southern California, which is 
reporting enough water and cash 
to get us through the drought — at 
least for now. 
What we can learn from the 
Metropolitan Water District is how 
it, and the city of Los Angeles, 
handled California’s last dry spell. 
Once the steep rate hikes and usage 
limits subsided after the drought, 
the city built new homes with low-
flow showerheads and dual-flush 
toilets. The older residential halls 
on campus would certainly benefit 
from similar modernizing upgrades 
that would reduce water usage by 
75 percent.San Diego will also see some 
water relief in the form of a desali -
nation plant, which converts ocean 
water to fresh water, set to open in 
Carlsbad in 2016. A project nearly 
a decade in the making, its success 
could signal the opportunity for 
some of UCSD’s brilliant young 
engineers to work on their own 
desalination initiatives.
One of the most troubling signs 
of the times is that in the month 
after Gov. Brown announced the 
drought as a statewide crisis, con -
sumption rates actually went up. 
We need to go in the exact opposite 
direction as we head into another 
predictably dry spring — not to 
mention our state’s famously dry 
summers.

It might be a good thing that William Shakespeare can’t time travel and 
see some of the more recent adaptations of his beloved plays. He might 
bite his thumb at Baz Luhrmann for that opening gunfight scene in 
1996’s “Romeo + Juliet” — that is, after the Bard figures out what a gas sta -
tion is. And he may be skeptical whether “ All the world’s a stage” includes 
19th century Japan, as Kenneth Branagh seems to think it does in 2006’s 
“ As Y ou Like It. ”
But if the world’s most celebrated playwright visited the Old Globe 
Theatre — a venue architecturally based on London’s Globe Theatre, 
where many of his works premiered — and saw Barry Edelstein’s rendi -
tion of “The Winter’s Tale, ” our intrepid Elizabethan time traveller would 
be more than pleased, even with its modern setting and garb. Balboa 
Park’s latest offering is a must-see for Shakespeare enthusiasts of every 
hue on the purist spectrum.
Though not as revered as “Hamlet” or “Macbeth, ” “Tale” is still an 
enchanting classic of envy, rediscovered love and the importance of family. 
The brash king of Sicily, Leontes (Billy Campbell, SyFy’s “Helix”), mis -
takenly assumes that his faithful wife Hermione (Natacha Roi) is having 
an affair with his childhood friend Polixenes, the king of Bohemia (Paul 
Michael Valley), after he observes how well the two get along. Jumping to 
conclusions, Leontes convinces himself that the pregnant Hermione bears 
Polixenes’s child, ultimately arresting his wife for adultery and sending the 
infant, Perdita, away to Bohemia after its birth. Hermione (whom, yes, is the namesake of a certain J.K. Rowling character) dies soon after, leaving 
Leontes distraught and alone.
The first half of “Tale” is much like your standard Shakespeare play, 
though Leontes and Polixenes don well-cut suits and bow ties rather than 
doublets and jerkins. Scenes smoothly transition from one to the next with 
innovative lighting and sets that evoke the splendor of Leontes’s Sicilian 
palace. But the production, overall, sometimes feels more like a quirky indie 
comedy, with spurts of minimalism owing to the soundtrack played live 
onstage by one pianist. In one scene, Leontes delivers a fevered monologue 
— complete with minor keys and discordant tunes from the lone piano — 
in his young son’s playroom while he contemplates Hermione’s possible 
infidelity; as his attendants stand by, the Sicilian king distractedly plays with 
a jack-in-the-box, adding to the subtly eccentric yet playful tone.
Even the second half of the play, which takes place 16 years after 
Perdita’s abandonment, seems more like an indie remake of Rodgers and 
Hammerstein’s “Oklahoma!” than a prim Shakespearean adaptation: The 
setting switches to a whimsical Bohemian forest with a strong Midwestern 
flavor inhabited by a down-to-earth, excessively blithe cast, including 
Perdita (Maya Kazan, “Frances Ha”) and her adoptive family, a kindly old 
shepherd (Mark Nelson) and his offbeat son Clown (Brendan Spieth).
This kind of interpretation does not take away from the source material 
A TALE BEST FOR WINTER
The Old Globe Theatre brings the Bard’s comedy to life in a glittering,

“Delectable, comestible, 
unavoidable and unstop -
pable” is the tagline that 
the Meshuggah Shack has given itself, 
and it couldn’t be more accurate. The 
coffee shop — a tiny, spring-green 
kiosk set up on the quiet corner of 
Goldfinch Street and Fort Stockton 
Drive — is not easy to miss. It’s sup -
ported by four pillars covered in an 
eclectic arrangement of mosaics, and 
a copious amount of Virgin Mary and 
Jesus memorabilia draws you in.
Outward appearance aside, the 
Meshuggah Shack’s menu itself is 
something to be reckoned with. In 
addition to basic coffees and teas, 
the menu offers “Fancy-Schmancy 
Espresso Drinks, ” “Iced Blended 
Yum” and customer favorites like 
“Mother’s Little Helper” (“Crack 
Head” Chai Latte, steamed milk 
and Ghirardelli Chocolate sauce) 
or “Jumpin’ Judas” (Coca Cola 
and two shots of espresso), which 
are the more experimental drinks 
on the menu. Some drinks on the 
menu are accompanied by unique 
descriptions — the “Cookies and 
Cream” is described humorously 
on the menu as “dreamy, possibly 
a lethal weapon. ” Rather than an 
unwanted addition, the quirky 
drink names and unusual descrip -
tions (don’t worry, they aren’t at 
all vague and devoid of ingredient 
descriptions) add to the charm of the 
place. The staff is extremely friendly, 
and the menu itself says that “advice 
is always free, ” making it easier to be 
adventurous with your drink choice. 
And it doesn’t hurt that the drinks 
themselves are just plain good.
Meshuggah Shack is relatively 
affordable for the everyday college 
student, whether s/he is looking 
for a simply well-made Americano 
or an intriguing drink, like the 
Sriracha infused “Serpent’s Kiss. ” 
All their “Noshes” (pastries), which 
are delivered daily from San Diego 
bakery-cafe Bread & Cie, cost $3 
or less, and most drinks average 
around $4. Besides the wide rang -ing menu, what makes this place 
different than a typical coffee shop 
is its setup. The collection of tiny 
tables that seat three people com -
fortably is outside, and it’s fairly 
limited — meaning the place isn’t 
the most conducive for studying. 
The flip side is that rather than iso -
lating yourself to a cellphone and 
laptop in any other run-of-the-mill coffee chain, the outdoor seating, 
corner location and welcoming 
environment means an authentic, 
local, neighborhood vibe and the 
opportunity to interact with people 
easily and freely with the extremely 
open layout at Meshuggah Shack.or detract from the play’s quality — if 
anything, a new dimension is added 
and improves upon what Shakespeare 
originally penned. Particularly in 
Bohemia, where shepherds and farm -
ers freely frolic about like the fairies 
in “ A Midsummer Night’s Dream, ” 
the audience lives the peasant expe -
rience. In fact, there are several 
instances when characters seem to 
break the fourth wall: We become the 
jurors of Hermione’s trial or are asked 
to sing along to the Bohemians catchy 
musical numbers.
Of course, this was pulled off flaw -
lessly in part because of the strength 
of the leads and supporting actors. 
Golden Globe nominee Campbell 
reveals a deeply flawed ruler in 
Leontes, yet one who is so charismat -
ic that we understand why more like -
able characters such as Hermione and 
Polixenes put up with him before he 
foolishly gives in to impulsive actions 
that drive the plot. But the standout 
performance of “Tale” comes in Angel 
Desai’s portrayal of Hermione’s best 
friend, Paulina. Here, we’re presented 
with one of Shakespeare’s strongest 
— and perhaps most overlooked — 
female characters. With her feistiness 
and cunning, Paulina outmaneuvers 
the whole Sicilian court, Leontes 
included. Put this woman in a room with “The Taming of the Shrew”’s 
and “Much Ado About Nothing”’s 
outspoken heroines, and we’ll see 
Katherina Minola and Beatrice leave 
shaking and sobbing before Paulina 
is finished ranting.
Characters like Paulina make 
us realize just how progressive and 
modern Shakespeare was to craft 
such a powerful woman at a time 
that still saw females as inferior. It 
then becomes understandable why 
Shakespeareans love to marry his 
verses in iambic pentameter — replete 
with archaic words — to a mod -
ern setting. The Bard would never 
understand our world of hashtags 
and chat abbreviations, just as we 
struggle to get what he really meant 
by “slings and arrows of outrageous 
fortune. ” But plays like Edelstein’s 
“The Winter’s Tale” remind us that 
that’s okay — we just have to open 
our minds up again to the original, 
and we can do so with ease. Toward 
the end of the play, the wily Autolycus 
(Paul Kandel) says, “ Age, thou hast 
lost thy labor” — and that couldn’t 
be more applicable to Shakespeare’s 
plays. The Bard will never get old, 
especially with adaptations like 
Edelstein’s that honor the past and 
still manage to appeal to the present./uni25B6 WINTER,  from page 7

JACQUELINE  KIM    JGK002@ucsd.edu monica  mcgill    mamcgill@ucsd.edu Shakespeare Production Shakes the StageAs an Iranian-American most 
accustomed to my grand -
mother’s excellent home cook -
ing, I’m a tough critic when it comes 
to finding Persian food outside of 
my own home. When I moved to 
San Diego last fall, I began searching 
for the perfect, Iranian restaurant 
in a city virtually unknown to me. 
Being on a budget (and also a bit 
lazy), my search came to fruition 
upon discovering Soltan Banoo in 
University Heights.
Located on the most populated 
strip of Park Avenue, Soltan Banoo 
draws you into its even more charm -
ing interior and great food through 
its curb appeal — silky drapes flow 
over the entryway, inviting guests 
inside. Soltan Banoo is one of many 
tastefully, thematically decorated 
restaurants in University Heights — 
which is a great area for shopping 
and drinks. So popular, in fact, that 
it’s sometimes tricky to find parking 
close by.
Soltan Banoo has an outdoor 
seating area that’s covered and heat -
ed during the winter but opens up 
to the street in the warmer months of the year, allowing customers to 
sit in the open windowsills to dine 
and enjoy passersby. Decorated with 
Persian rugs, ornate calligraphy 
drawings and various paintings in 
traditional, Iranian styles, Soltan 
Banoo leaves patrons feeling like 
they’re seated in a cozy living room.
Soltan Banoo calls its food 
“eclectic Persian cuisine, ” and its 
food puts a modern spin on tra -
ditional dishes, combining basic 
elements of classic, Persian cuisine 
and reinventing them into new 
foods. The restaurant is known 
for its Ash Anar ($5.95 per bowl), 
or pomegranate soup, a food not 
regularly found in Iran. Y et, it 
includes pomegranate, an essential 
item used in Persian cooking, along 
with barley and lentils, ingredients 
normally found in most Persian 
soups. The menu has a full range 
of kabobs, various types of rice, 
salads and wraps. The daily specials 
reflect authentic Persian food more 
accurately than the rest of the menu, 
which is a little too “ Americanized” 
for my taste. (Wraps and items such 
as hummus and tabouli are not 
customarily served in traditional 
Persian restaurants.)
I decided to try the daily special, 
Abgousht ($10.95), a meat stew slow cooked with lamb, chickpeas, 
potatoes and tomato. My friend 
ordered the vegan wrap ($6.95) 
with babaganoush, veggies, avocado 
and rice inside, served with tabouli 
salad. While there were only a few 
customers in the restaurant while we 
were there, it took a long time for 
the food to arrive. My stew arrived 
in a large bowl with an entire lamb 
shank, half of a potato and plenty 
of broth and beans to go with it. It 
also came with a side of pita bread 
and salad-e-shirazi, a combination 
of tomatoes, cucumbers and onions in oil and lemon juice. The stew was 
piping hot — one of the best I have 
had at a restaurant. The lamb was 
cooked to perfection; the meat was 
soft and tender and slid right off the 
bone. The broth was also good but 
spiced a little too much with dried 
lemon for my personal taste. The 
wrap was delicious as well, served 
in your choice of a large tortilla or 
lavash bread. Adding Persian-style 
rice with saffron in it was a nice 
touch, but the tabouli salad was dry 
and not flavorful.
Soltan Banoo’s food is worth the drive if you’re looking for a 
contemporary and well-priced take 
on Persian cuisine. Try to make it 
over to Soltan Banoo during their 
lunch hours (11 a.m. to 3 p.m.) — 
the same items are served for lunch 
and dinner, but the lunch slashes 
prices by $2 to $3. The food here is 
authentic and delicious, but the slow 
service is less than enthralling, espe -
cially after you’ve working up an 
appetite looking for parking.The Guardian samples the world’s cuisine in San Diego. This week: Iran.

From a distance, Israeli soldiers 
shoot at Omar as he scales a 
massive cement wall. When he 
lands on the other side, escaping their 
blows, he washes the dirt off his hands 
and heads for his friend’s house. This 
is part of Omar’s daily routine. So 
ordinary that when he returns and 
an Israeli soldier asks him, “Where 
have you been?” he retorts, in jest, 
“The casino. ” The problem is that 
these soldiers are not fond of “clowns. ” 
Director Hany Abu-Assad’s “Omar” 
narrates the many consequences 
a Palestinian faces for lashing out 
against Israeli occupation. And while 
this film, like his 2005 Golden Globe winner “Paradise Now, ” follows a 
group of childhood friends as they 
mature into freedom fighters, it is far 
less thrilling. At the end of the day, 
Abu-Assad displays an honest, politi -
cal landscape, inhabited by flat and 
underdeveloped characters.
Throughout the film, Abu-Assad 
reminds us of the imbalance between 
Israeli and Palestinian resources. 
Israeli militants are equipped with 
helicopters and private investigators, 
while the freedom fighters scrounge 
up a stolen car, a couple of rifles and 
a pack of cigarettes. It doesn’t take 
much time to recognize these freedom 
fighters as the underdogs of the film. However, the sincere determination 
of their mission remains dormant 
throughout the script. And despite 
the popular misconception that a 
scar and a little bit of fake blood can 
speak a thousand words, we are left 
searching for Omar’s motive among 
the shrapnel.
In fact, Abu-Assad seems to have 
shaved layers of truth off the film 
before wiping it down with Clorox 
and sending it out into the world. 
Even the scenes that depict Israeli 
soldiers torturing captured freedom 
fighters are polite and short-lived.
Rare moments of integrity do, 
however, illuminate from the deep, 
knowing eyes of Omar (Adam Bakri) 
and his partners in crime, Amjad 
(Samer Bisharat) and Tarek (Iyad 
Hoorani), who give the film a hum -
bling quality that reminds us why this 
story is important. Especially mov -
ing performances by Leem Lubany 
(Nadia) and W aleed Zuaiter (Agent 
Rami) drop us into a world where 
every man is a suspect, regardless of 
his past.
Unfortunately, before we become 
fully invested in the alluring cast, the 
unexplored love quadrangle between 
Omar and pals and the one female 
lead in the movie sends us into a frenzy of hormonal freedom fight -
ers. The romance between Omar 
and Nadia could have saved the 
film. However, Abu-Assad bypasses 
every chemical element that bubbles 
beneath the surface of their forbidden 
relationship. The couple exchanges 
love letters — the contents of which 
we never see — and we are left in the 
shallow end of a potentially powerful 
love story. Lubany hits the nail on the 
head as a spunky, Palestinian woman 
hindered by the constraints of a patri -
archal society. But Abu-Assad trims 
her crucial scenes and once again 
shoos us out of the theater before the 
curtains close.
If you can swallow an under -
cooked plot, you will be more 
aware of the political turmoil that 
exists between Israel and Palestine. 
However, in order to promote any 
kind of awareness, Abu-Assad would 
have had to finish his movie. Instead, 
“Omar” reaches its stubby hands in all 
sorts of directions and ends up return -
ing home with an incomplete account 
of the life of a freedom fighter.

“Voices, ” the newest release 
by New Y ork electro-pop 
duo Phantogram, has a 
song entitled “Bill Murray. ” This can 
only mean good things.
The aforementioned song is a 
pensive ballad reminiscent of the 
mellow, dreamy sound of Beach 
House and The xx. Evoking a cer -
tain cinematic grandeur, guitarist 
Josh Carter explained to the Atlantic 
that the song earned its title because 
Phantogram “always pictured a sad 
Bill Murray for the visuals of that 
song. ” A buzzing synthesizer propels 
the song forward in the verses, while 
the chorus is adorned by the twin -
kling of a shy xylophone. It shows a 
more controlled and refined side of 
the duo and could very well end up 
on the soundtrack — set to synths — 
of the next Sofia Coppola movie.
In composing the new album, 
Carter and vocalist Sarah Barthel 
spent an entire summer locked up in 
a remote barn in upstate New Y ork, 
just as they did when writing their 
2009 debut album, “Eyelid Movies. ” In 
a Times Union interview, Carter said 
they strive for a sound that is rhyth -
mic with “swirling guitars, spacey 
keyboards” and echoing “airy vocals. ” 
Unsurprisingly, the duo has drawn 
comparisons ranging from The Y eah 
Ye a h  Ye a h s  t o  P u r it y  R i n g .
As a result of teaming up with pro -
ducer John Hill, whose highly varied 
repertoire includes everything from 
Shakira to Santigold to Snoop Dogg, 
the finished product incorporates 
a mix of genres — trip-hop, instru -mental jazz, rock and electronica — 
which is delivered with confidence 
by Barthel’s unwavering vocals. 
Showcasing Phantogram’s affinity 
for sampling, “Fall in Love” is the 
sultry, standout track on the album. 
With its dizzying instrumentals and 
catchy melodies, it features a fusion 
of hip-hop samples and cascading 
dream pop strings, with elements 
of rock courtesy of distorted guitar 
licks and staccato cymbals. Each 
part of the song dramatically chang -
es sound, disorienting the listener, 
like the turning of a kaleidoscope. 
In these four minutes, Barthel and 
Carter are irresistible.
Despite the heavy confluence of 
genres into each song, Phantogram’s 
delivery seems effortless. In an inter -
view with Billboard Magazine, they 
justified this by explaining, “This is 
how people listen to music today. ” 
They battle the short attention span of 
their listeners with intriguing samples 
and melodic adornments.
The downside of this is over-
embellishment. Some songs, such 
as “I Don’t Blame Y ou, ” are heavy 
and sound disjointed. It would be 
interesting to hear a more minimalist 
approach for their next endeavor with 
the synthetic drum machine absent. 
However, Phantogram is confident in 
what they do, striving to constantly 
perfect their signature sound. At the 
same time, they express humbleness. 
You  c an’t  h e lp  but  ro ot  for  t h e m .

         editorial AssistantAngel Olsen exists in a rela -
tively foreign musical sphere 
by today’s standards. On her 
2012 debut, “Half Way Home, ” she 
took away the reverb employed on 
past releases, baring her strong, 
unprocessed voice to establish mood 
instead. The album was stripped 
down, yes, but Olsen holds such a 
distinct presence through the timbre 
and range of her voice that it’s easy 
to reciprocate her feelings of loss and 
loneliness. Despite, for the most part, 
employing little more than a guitar, 
“Half Way Home” showed incredible 
talent and potential.
It’s no surprise, then, that Olsen’s 
sophomore album, “Burn Your Fire 
for No Witness, ” expands upon her 
distinctive sound and showcases 
her capacity as a singer-songwriter. 
With producer John Congleton, 
known for his work with St. 
Vincent, the album hosts a higher 
level of instrumentation that pro -
vides solid foundation for her voice 
to flourish. Distorted guitars pro -
vide a solid foundation for her songs 
to reach emotional highs detailing 
forgiveness and unrequited love 
on the standout track “Forgiven/Forgotten. ” On the other end, the 
lightly strummed guitar on “White 
Fire” complements the devastatingly 
desolate lyrics like, “I heard my 
mother thinking me right back into 
my birth/ I laughed so loud inside 
myself it all began to hurt. ”
The album oscillates between 
these positives and negatives, often 
either celebrating or ruminating 
over independence and loneliness. 
Despite the variety of many of the 
songs, rarely is there any interplay 
between these two poles. Distorted 
and unfiltered guitars rarely cross 
paths on the album, and it would 
have been nice to see structural 
variation within individual songs.
Yet any gripe is easily overcome 
by the stark, unabashed beauty and 
content of the album as a whole. 
“Burn Your Fire for No Witness” 
is music to ponder, but it never 
feels too overbearing or compli -
cated. Olsen has created a deep, 
yet deceptively simple work that 
showcases authentic emotion and

Versus! is a back-and-forth 
discussion column meant for 
the geekier members of our 
audience. Every quarter, we’ll consult 
our resident superhero aficionados 
Nathan and Nick on the latest and 
most divisive film, comic, animation 
and entertainment news. This time, 
we’ve set them loose on the upcom -
ing plans of Marvel Studios.
Marvel will soon expand their 
roster of heroes with the third 
“phase” of their film universe and are 
reaching some of their less-known 
characters, including Doctor Strange, 
The Guardians of the Galaxy and … 
Ant-Man? Despite his unimpressive 
name, an Ant-Man film has been 
announced for 2015. Also known as 
Hank Pym, this super-scientist has 
the power to shrink himself down 
to the size of an ant, among other 
abilities.
NICK : As far as heroes go, Ant-
Man has long been a C-list super -
hero with lackluster powers and a 
largely uninteresting role. Ant-Man 
holds significance in the Marvel 
Universe for two reasons: his role 
in founding the Avengers and his 
creation of the evil artificial intel -
ligence Ultron. The Avengers were 
already founded in the Marvel 
Cinematic Universe back in 2012, 
and a recent statement from Joss 
Whedon, the director of “ Avengers 
2: The Age of Ultron, ” has con -
firmed that Ultron, the antagonist 
in the second Avengers movie, will 
not be created by Pym.
NATHA N: Although Ant-Man may 
be a C-lister, Hank Pym has always 
been between an A and B. While 
he may not create Ultron in this 
interpretation (early word has it that 
Tony Stark will be the one to invent 
the mechanical villain), he is still a 
brilliant mind to be reckoned with 
— especially while the other Marvel 
super-genius, Reed Richards, is cur -
rently owned for movie use by 20th 
Century Fox.
NICK: While Ant-Man may appeal 
to die-hard comic fans, the ques -
tion remains whether mainstream 
audiences would be actually willing 
to line up to watch a movie about a 
man who shrinks and talks to bugs 
for an hour and a half.
NATHA N: We already know that 
the movie won’t focus on the study 
of insects. It’s directed by Edgar 
Wright of “Shaun of the Dead” fame. 
We can expect a high-stakes, high-
laughs, thrill ride focusing on the 
heist of Hank Pym’s Ant-Man tech -
nology. Think a one-man “Ocean’s 
Eleven” mixed with “Iron Man. ”
NICK: Just think of the marketing 
that would need to be done! The 
toys and products that can be sold, 
like Hulk hands or Thor’s ham -
mer, are the reason these movies 
get made. God help the marketing 
department that has the challenge 
of thinking up ways of selling Ant-
Man-related toys to today’s youth. 
Replica Ant-Man’s ants?
NATHA N: I’ll admit, Ant-Man is 
not quite the moniker that moves 
toys off the shelves like “Thor” or 
“Iron Man. ” Then again, Marvel is 
looking to diversify its output all 
the time — and one has to reason 
that the main purpose of the film 
isn’t merchandising so much as 
proving that they can make a differ -
ent sort of superhero.

1TOTALS consecutive goals from Guiliana, 
sophomore center Lauren Finwall and 
junior attacker Andie Nishimi.
Against Wagner later that day, 
sophomore goalie Courtney Miller 
blocked 15 shots for the Tritons to 
help them gain the upper hand in a 
close finish. Lizotte, along with fel -
low senior defense Allison Delgado, 
junior attacker Rachel Brooks and 
Kirkland, powered the offense with 
two goals apiece. UCSD improves to 
9–3 overall after finishing out the 
Bison Invitational. 
“Some may think that flights can -
celed, a time change, an eleven hour 
bus ride, snow storms and below-
thirty degree weather would cause 
drama and stress amongst the team, 
but I believe this trip brought our 
already close-knit team even closer, ” 
Bartow said.
On tap for the Triton women is a 
road trip up to UC Irvine for the UC 
Irvine Invite this weekend. 
“The UCI tournament is always 
a huge one for us every year, ” Lizotte 
said. “There are pretty much all top-
12 schools competing at UCI this 
weekend, and I think it’s going to be 
great for us to see our progress thus 
far and see where we are headed. ”
UCSD kicks off the tournament 
with a match up against the University 
of Hawaii on Saturday at 11:45 a.m.
“Hawaii will be a great first game, ” 
Lizotte said. “I think we are more than 
capable of competing with any team 
in the top ten. So I’m excited to see 
how it will go. ”
 
 decision. UCSD again faced excel -
lent pitching in the nightcap, this 
time from Chico State’s Brad Lohse 
who threw six shutout frames for the 
Wildcats and struck out five, only 
allowing four hits.“ Across the board 
they made more plays than we did, ” 
UCSD head coach Eric Newman told 
the UCSD Athletics Department after 
the loss. “They just outcompeted us. ”
The closer was won by UCSD for the split, largely due to the perfor -
mance of sophomore right-handed 
pitcher Troy Cruz’s presence on the 
mound. Across seven innings, Cruz 
allowed only a pair of runs on six hits 
and earned two strikeouts. Senior 
right-handed pitcher Scott Zeman 
closed out the game in the ninth with 
just one pitch by forcing a fielder’s 
choice grounder.
“I felt like it was a pretty big 
game, ” Cruz said to UCSD Athletics 
Department. “It was a good opportu -nity to get the ball today. ”
On offense, UCSD padded its 
early lead with a four-run fourth 
but failed to produce more runs in 
subsequent innings. Redshirt fresh -
man outfield Brandon Shirley batted 
a team-high .444 in the series and 
went 2-for-4 in the final win.The 
season opening stretch has held a 
list of formidable opponents for the 
Tritons, a trend that continues into 
next weekend as UCSD faces Cal Poly 
Pomona.“Next weekend is going to be 
another great series, ” Newman told 
the UCSD Athletics Department. “I 
expect us to come out with a couple 
wins. ”

GAMES
In a commanding string of perfor -
mances, the UCSD softball team 
claimed its first conference series 
win over Chico State University, Feb. 
14 to Feb. 15.
Winning three games out of the 
four-game series, the No. 13 nation -
ally ranked Tritons improve to 8–2 
overall and 3–1 in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association.
When asked about the weekend’s 
performance, UCSD head coach 
Patti Gerckens said she was pleased 
with the Tritons in their conference 
opener.
“I think we played well over -
all, but we definitely weren’t at our 
best, ” senior third-baseman Emily 
McQuaid said. “That being said, I 
think for not playing our best we still 
came away with a good result. ”
The series served as a coming-out 
party of sorts for sophomore pitcher 
Alexis Edwards. Edwards, who bat -
tled injury last season, pitched 13 
innings for UCSD, earning two wins 
and was named the CCAA Pitcher 
of the Week for her performance. And now, 10 games into the season, 
Edwards (4–0) has an ERA of 0.88.
“It’s very exciting for us, ” Gerckens 
said of Edwards’ performance over 
the weekend. “Two nights for us she 
pretty much goes the distance, and I 
was very proud of her. ”
The Tritons will next face Cal 
State East Bay at home in a four-game 
series this Friday, Feb. 28.
“East Bay’s always a tricky team, 
and they’re definitely capable of 
winning close games and taking the 
series, ” McQuaid said. “But we’re 
looking forward to taking care of 
business this weekend. ”
Game 1, 2–0
UCSD won the first game of the 
series on the mound. Going the dis -
tance, Edwards allowed just four 
hits in her seven innings, while the 
Tritons would do all of its scoring in 
the first inning.
Leadoff hitter sophomore out -
fielder Callie Grant found herself on 
third after walking to get on base. 
Batting cleanup senior Caitlin Brown, 
who recorded 42 RBI last season, delivered again to score Grant. Next 
up redshirt freshman first-baseman 
Emma Schneider — UCSD’s current 
RBI leader — grounded out to move 
Brown over to second. Brown stole 
third and reached home on a Wildcat 
error.
Although the Tritons recorded 
just three hits, UCSD had the chance 
to extend its lead in the third inning 
but left three men stranded on base.
Game 2, 2–1
In another low-scoring bout on 
Friday, the Tritons were just edged 
out by the Wildcats. Senior pitcher 
Jennifer Manuel — tasked to throw 
the first 5.1 innings — kept Chico 
scoreless through the first three 
innings. UCSD went up 1–0 in the 
bottom of the third off a Grant RBI 
that scored sophomore utility Amani 
Proctor.
The Wildcats would return the 
favor in the top of the fourth, capi -
talizing on a Triton throwing error. 
Chico would score again in the fifth 
inning after loading the bases.
Game 3, 4–0With Edwards back on the mound, 
UCSD shut out the Wildcats in the 
first game last Saturday.
The Tritons took their time warm -
ing their bats, with the game remain -
ing scoreless until the sixth inning. 
Grant opened up the inning with 
a triple to right field. Pinch hitter 
freshman Bianca Devoto and Brown 
both popped out, and so with two 
outs Schneider managed to walk. 
Pinch running for Schneider, senior 
Mya Romero stole second. With men 
on second and third, sophomore 
McKenna Clewett tripled to left-cen -
ter to score Grant and Romero. Next 
up, senior outfielder Taylor Sepulveda 
tripled to right field to bring Clewett 
home before stealing home.
Game 4,  10–4
In the most dynamic game of the 
series, the Tritons came from behind, 
scoring six runs in the third inning to 
secure the series win.
In the third inning, down 4–1, 
Proctor bunted to score McQuaid. 
Next up, Brown walked to load the 
bases, while pinch-hitter sophomore Alissa Gutierrez hit a sacrifice fly to 
bring in another runner. With two 
outs and men on second and third, 
Sepulveda came up with another 
big hit, singling to left field to score 
Proctor. The score now tied, UCSD 
continued to rally as sophomore 
catcher Katie Saunders scored anoth -
er Triton off a single up the middle. 
Down 5–4, Chico brought in pitcher 
Ariel De Trinidad for damage control, 
but Romero would pick up another 
hit to put the Tritons up 6–4.
“The six-running inning was huge 
for us, ” Gerckens told the UCSD 
Athletics Department Saturday. “It 
really took their momentum away, 
and I thought they really did a great 
job. ”
UCSD continued to light up 
Chico’s pitchers, scoring four more 
runs, while sophomore right-hander 
Hannah Duarte and Manuel teamed 
up to shut the Wildcats out through 
the remainder.

Strong Results at Bison InvitationalBA SEBALL
Tritons Split in Season’s 
First Conference Series  
Severe weather and travel delays 
could not hold back the UCSD 
women’s water polo team from 
putting forth a strong, competitive 
showing against several top teams 
in the annual Bison Invitational in 
Lewisburg, Pa., Saturday, Feb. 15 to 
Feb. 16.
“I don’t think the unexpected 
travel hindered our play, ” senior util -
ity Sarah Lizotte said. “More than 
anything we were all ready to get back 
into the water and back into the swing 
of things. ”
The team was stranded in Chicago 
for the night last Thursday due to 
flight cancellations, forcing the 
Tritons to take an 11-hour-long bus 
ride to Lewisburg on Friday. With 
UCSD still not in Pennsylvania, its 
opening game of the tournament 
against host team Bucknell University 
was cancelled.
Instead, No. 13 UCSD began play 
on Saturday against No. 20 University 
of Michigan, followed by a face-off 
with No. 8 Princeton later in the 
afternoon. 
Starting off the day strong, the 
Tritons drowned Michigan in a 13–7  
victory to kick off their tournament 
play. Lizotte — who broke the all-time 
scoring and assists record formerly 
held by former U.S. Olympian Julie 
Swail — recorded a hat-trick right 
away in game one, getting the team 
off and running for their first win of 
the weekend. 
Sophomore attacker Julia Kirkland 
also chipped in three goals, while 
senior center Melissa Bartow put away another two.
“The first game against Michigan 
I think it really showed we came out 
strong after being held up in a bus the 
whole day before, ” Bartow said.
Falling 9–8 in a close match with 
Princeton in game two, the Tritons 
ended the day just short to cap off 
the first day of the tournament with 
a split. 
The next day UCSD closed out 
the Bison Invitational with a pair 
of wins at the Kinney Natatorium, 
over unranked George Washington University 14–7 and No. 20 Wagner 
College 10–9. 
“The first game we played a lot of 
our younger girls and allowed them to 
gain game experience, ” Bartow said. 
“Which I believe is huge in the devel -
opment of a player. ”
Junior attacker Jolene Guiliana 
recorded a hat-trick in game one 
against George Washington. The 
Tritons gained the lead and held it 
after solid second period with three UCSD wins three, drops one despite weather delays, improves to 9-3 on season.

See W. WATER POLO , page 11No. 39 ranked UCSD split its 
first conference series against 
No. 12 Chico State last Sunday, 
Feb. 16 with a win. The Tritons are 5–4 
on the season and 2–2 in California 
Collegiate Athletic Association action.
 In the series opener last Friday, 
sophomore right-handed pitcher 
Justin Donatella out-pitched Chico 
State’s Nick Baker to give UCSD a 
win in its first conference game of the 
season. Donatella shut out the pre -
season favorite Wildcats in six frames, 
only allowing one hit and throwing 
six strikeouts in his first career-start in 
conference play for the 8–1 win.
“I just attacked the hitters, ” 
Donatella said to the UCSD Athletics 
Department after UCSD’s first game, 
Friday, Feb. 14. “Once our batters gave 
us the lead I decided to keep it. ”
The Triton offense demoralized 
the Wildcats’ All-CCAA First Team 
pitcher Baker early and ended his night 
in the third after UCSD scored six runs 
on six hits. The all-conference selec -
tion only lasted 2.1 innings against 
Triton bats. The highlight of the game 
came in the third inning when senior designated-hitter Nick La Face tripled 
to left field and brought in two runs. 
UCSD earned 12 hits on the day and 
now leads the conference with 20 hit-
by-pitches.
But UCSD could not repeat its 
domination over the Wildcats in a 
doubleheader on Saturday, as Chico 
State handily won the first game 7–2 
and took the second game 3–1.
Junior left-handed pitcher Trevor 
Scott took the mound for the Tritons in 
game one and threw a three-run first 
inning and allowed another Wildcat 
run in the fourth. UCSD was unable to 
climb out of the deficit against Wildcat 
stars Marcos Lara and Luke Barker, 
who largely shut out the Tritons from 
the mound. Triton batters were unable 
to produce hits in critical moments 
and left 11 runners on base to only 
score two runs.
Chico State found the board early 
in game two with a sacrifice fly for a 
single RBI in the first. The Wildcats 
added two more in the fourth from 
another single RBI and a bases-loaded 
walk-off of senior right-handed pitch -
er Blake Fassler for his first losing UCSD goes 2-2 in conference opener against Chico.
