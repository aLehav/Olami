The A.S. Office of External 
Affairs held a rally yester-day on Library Walk, part 
of a campaign aimed at protecting the future of Cal Grants with a state constitutional amendment.
The campaign, which began 
at a UC Students Association board meeting last month, hopes to convince Sen. Denise Ducheny (D-Chula Vista) to draft an amend-ment that would save the Cal Grants from future funding cuts.
In May, Governor 
Schwarzenegger  proposed to eliminate the Cal Grant program completely, inciting protests across all 10 UC campuses.
“Luckily, the legislature put 
the money back and gave a lot of students who rely on the Cal Grant renewed hope for being able to attend their university, ” Celina Velazquez, Legislative Liaison for the A.S. Office of External Affairs, said.
The event is part of a state-
wide campaign organized by the REGISTRATION 
FEES PULLED 
FROM STUDENT 
SERVICES
By Ayelet Bitton
Staff Writer  
Over $1 million in student reg-
istration fees have been reallocated from student services to compensate a campus funding shortfall of $84.2 million. An additional $2.5 million has been set aside in anticipation of future funding cuts.
Each UCSD student currently 
pays $900 in annual registration fees — funds intended for a variety of student service programs, ranging from counseling and psychological services to the Career Services Center and campus sports facilities. 
However, due to cutbacks in 
state funding, the Office of the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs is now 
channeling $1,316,672 — or 8 percent of the $19 million total reg-istration-fee budget — toward other areas such as the Registrar’s Office, the Office of 
Admissions, classroom maintenence, staff salaries and equipment.
Last year, the Registration Fee 
Advisory Committee released a report recommending where regis-tration fees should be reallocated.
“[In] normal years we go through 
and we decide what we want to allo-cate for new programs and initia-tives, but this past year was essen-tially a unique one, ” former commit-tee chair and graduate student Garo Bournoutian said.
Since July, the Vice Chancellor 
departments have reduced their operating budgets to remedy the $84.2 million budget cuts. The chang-es amount to roughly $20 million in cuts, while the newly implemented faculty furlough plan will save an additional $75 million. 
The remaining gap of about 
$40 million was filled by a loan from internal funds, Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Ed Spriggs said.
The Office of the Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs determined the final registration-fee budget and allo-cations, using the committee’s report as a guide. 
“Because we’re trying to protect 
the academic mission, all of the vice-chancellor off ices contributed, ” 
Spriggs said. “The reg. fee commit-;\]LMV\[:ITTaNWZ+IT/ZIV\[-05(5*0(3(0+:;(;,:,5(;69+,*305,:;6:765:69.9(5;(4,5+4,5;

Top: Roughly 15 students 
gathered in front of Geisel 
Library Oct. 29 to promote a constitutional amendment that would make Cal Grants a mandatory part of the state budget. Student speakers shared personal ﬁnancial struggles and advocated to save a program that provided $967 million in ﬁnancial aid this year.
Berkeley Leads Conference on Higher Education
By Jake Blanc
Senior Staff Writer
In reaction to recent budget cuts, 
over 800 people filled the Pauley 
Auditorium at UC Berkeley on Oct. 
24 in an effort to coordinate statewide 
action in defense of public educa-tion. The conference was attended by students, faculty and community members from UC campuses, state universities, community colleges, K-12 education and labor unions. 
The conference resulted in the 
decision to call a statewide strike and day of action on March 4 to build a unified movement of all educational sectors in the state. 
“I was really happy with how 
the conference turned out, ” Desiree Angelo, a student organizer from the City College of San Francisco, said. “We had really less than a month to organize it, and we got over 800 people from across the state — from across public education — together in one room. ” 
Along with voting on the March 4 
strike, the conference called for state-wide action from Nov. 17 to Nov. 19 to coincide with a meeting of the UC Board of Regents in Los Angeles. The labor unions in attendance endorsed both proposals, which called for soli-darity to support the student move-ment.
“There was overwhelming sup-
port for solidarity action [on Nov. 17] and overwhelming support for the March 4 strike, ” Angelo said. “ All different sectors of public education 
voted to endorse solidarity action. ”
Participants also discussed pro-
posals ranging from similar types 
of university strikes to more radical 
Organizers call for 
three days of action in Nov., strike in March.

With a major fee increase 
rapidly approaching amid systemwide unrest, 
UC President Mark G. Yudof announced a new effort to raise funds for financial aid over the next four years.Under “Project: Y ou Can, ” the 
10 UC campuses will attempt to raise $1 billion from private sources by 2014. Yudof said he hopes the plan will eventually alleviate the mounting financial stress placed on students as fees increase.
The UC Board of Regents will 
be meeting next month to vote on a potential 32-percent fee increase.But UC Student Association 
President Victor Sanchez said stu-dents aren’t convinced.
“It’s a [public relations] kind 
of thing, ” Sanchez said. “When they’re about to raise fees, they put together an additional financial-aid package to go along with it.

It’s an unhealthy and unsustainable 
cycle. ”
Yudof also said he is seeking to 
modify the boundaries of the Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan  — the UC Office of the President’s trophy financial aid package  — which was originally approved by the regents in February. 
The plan currently covers the 
system-wide fees of California resi-dents whose families earn less than $60,000 per year. Blue and Gold students with sufficient financial need also qualify for further grant aid to help reduce the cost of atten-dance.
Yudof said he wants to raise 
the family income ceiling for the plan from $60,000 per year to $70,000 per year. Under the pro-posal change, approximately 800 more UC students would have their system-wide fees fully covered by the university. 
“We’re in the opportunity busi-ness, and even in hard fiscal times we are going to be doing everything we can to preserve one of the great-est attributes of the university — its rare combination of world-class education and research and its high proportion of students from low-income families, ” Yudof said in a statement.
Vasquez said there are 52,000 UC 
students whose families make under $70,000 a year. 
Thurgood Marshall College 
junior Anashe Bandari disagrees with the proposal. She said it would make more sense to lower fees for current UC students than to raise them while promising full rides to both current and prospective stu-dents.
“I am helping someone pay for 
their education when I can hardly pay for mine, ” Bandari said. “It’s not fair. ”

propositions — like the establishment 
of a tent city in Sacramento and the occupation of a Wells Fargo bank in Oakland.
On the day’s agenda were discus-
sions about the current state of public education, debates on what course of action to take regarding it and open-floor opportunities for anyone to voice their opinion. During the afternoon, the conference split into four different groups — one for each of the UC campuses, state colleges, community colleges and K-12 — that discussed their individual demands and how they could be connected with the movement as a whole.
The inclusion of so many sectors 
of public education, while seen as a positive development by organizers, presented problems, as well.
“There was some conflict, ” UC 
Berkeley student Lucy Carrillo said. “ At the community colleges, they’re threatening to take away summer school and cut back a lot of money from their funding starting in January. So a lot of community colleges are fighting to have this day of action happen before [the March 4th strike]. ” 
Lucy Carillo, a UC Berkeley stu-
dent, saw the conference’s diversity as a huge step toward a successful cam-paign throughout the state.
“There were students, grad stu-
dents, faculty, workers, unions, par-ents from elementary, middle and high schools, ” Carrillo said. “I don’t think anybody was left out; we had people from all sectors. ”
Echoing Carrillo’s beliefs, Angelo 
touched upon the significance of hav-ing such a wide range of representa-tives at a conference in support of all public sectors. “There were also parents there 
who have kids in the public educa-tion system and there were a lot of folks involved in organizing against the budget cuts who identify as com-munity members, ” Angelo said. “Folks from public sectors as a whole came to the conference and said how can we work together, how can we bond in this. ”
Most students in attendance had 
no affiliation with any one specific campus political group, representing instead the growing numbers of pro-active students looking for a means to fight against rising tuition fees. 
“This was definitely for non-orga-
nizers to get organized, ” Carillo said. “Most of the people who are going to be [influential] in this struggle are going to be those who aren’t organized right now. There’s a lot of opportunity for the different communities to get involved in their own movements. ”
No representatives of the regents 
or public administrators attended the conference. Organizers of the meet-ing view this as a positive sign and as motivation for their movement to go even further. 
“Our plan is to go where they are, ” 
Angelo said. “We went to the Trustees meeting Thursday night and we plan to go to the regents’ meeting down in LA... The only time they’ve ever tried to communicate with us was after the walkout and it was a clear attempt to get us to pick at each other. ” 
The conference’s Continuation 
Committee is currently writing up the final draft of their strike proposal to be distributed throughout the state and presented to the UC administration.

Alleged racial remarks by a 
vendor on Library Walk —toward an African-American 
student after her booth was robbed — made for a prolonged debate at the A.S. meeting last night.
During public input, AVP 
Local Affairs Aries Yumul brought 
Tuesday’s “attack on a student of color” to the council’s attention. 
“This is hap-
pening in 2009 on our campus on Library Walk, ” Yumul said. “This isn’t ignorance; there is zero tolerance for actions of hatred. ”
AVP Academic Affairs and 
University Centers Advisory Board chair Jordan Taylor  warned the coun-
cil that they might soon see a referen-dum regarding a Loft programming fee of $4.91 per student per quarter. He mentioned a potential partnership with the Graduate Student Association in an effort to lower the fee to $4.04.
Student consultants for the Center 
for Student Involvement Stephanie 
Usry  and Tiffany Rivera reminded the 
council of the advantages of One Stop for student leaders and organizations.
Campuswide Senator Adam 
Kenworthy  discussed his A.S. visibil-
ity initiatives plan. One of the more interesting and lesser-known ways for students to interact with the council, he said, is the A.S. Events Line — a phone number that students can call anytime for a listing of the day’s events on and off campus. The number is (858) 534-7529.
A.S. President Utsav Gupta 
announced some recent policy chang-es that deeply concerned him. He said one change to the electronic policy allows the university to retain copies of all UCSD e-mails for evidence pres-ervation.
“I’ll look further into the policy 
and see if it is systemwide or if we can even reverse this. I know many stu-dents treat their UCSD email like their personal account, ” Gupta said. 
Vice President of External Affairs 
Gracelynne West  spoke about the 
Nov. 19 UC Board of Regents meet-
ing, where the regents will vote on a proposed 32-percent student fee increase and new enrollment cuts. 
Warren  
Senator Alyssa Wing and Sixth 
College Senator Kevin Nguyen  said 
only three councilmembers attended the men’s soccer and women’s vol-leyball games last week, and strongly encouraged more members to support the athletes. 
“ After the game, the soccer players 
saw us walking and asked us, ‘If A.S. loves us, then why are there only thee of you guys?’ We couldn’t refute that, ” Wing said.
Councilmembers later returned 
to the vendor’s racist remarks to a student on Library Walk. Yumul drafted a resolution titled “Resolution for Adherence to UCSD Ideals of Community by Vendors and Non-Affiliates. ” However, several council-members had issues with its wording.
After numerous failed motions, 
debate continued for about an hour, and the council’s official position was not resolved by the end of the night.
Marshall Chair Tanvir Dhillon 
attempted to smooth over any hard feelings created by the heated discus-sion with some hopeful words. 
“Even though we may disagree, 
I hope we can still be friends and love each other outside of this room, ” Dhillon said./]X\I+WVKMZVML?Q\P-UIQT

BusinessExternal Affairs offices at each UC 
campus to pass an amendment that would make Cal Grant funding a guar-antee instead of something that has to be re-approved from year to year. 
UCSD’s external affairs office met 
with Ducheny last week to discuss the amendment. So far, however, attempts to garner Ducheny’s support have been less successful than West would have liked. 
“She’s been a strong advocate for Cal Grants and for education, but … she doesn’t feel strongly that Cal Grants should be mandatory funded, ” West said. “I really hope that we can continue to pressure her for her sup-port. ”
West said Ducheny currently 
favors an effort to gather outside funding for the Cal Grant pro-gram over drafting a constitutional amendment. 
Though the rally was sparsely 
attended — about 15 to 20 people 
held signs outside Geisel  Library — it attracted local media attention. News stations like San Diego 6 and Univision Televisione, among others, provided bilingual publicity for the event.
“We really hope to phone more 
students and really get the word out, ” West said. “Hopefully, this is the start of even stronger press con-ferences. ”

tee’s recommendation is the best evi-dence of what is important to stu-dents, so that of course gets a lot of weight. ” 
Programs that suffered the largest 
cuts included intercol-legiate athletics, which lost $139,314 — or 15 percent — of its reg-istration fee funding. Career services and sports facilities lost 10 percent each — or $107,219 and $40,245, respectively. 
The committee 
said these departments would have sufficient funds to fall back on, while still being able to maintain services because they do not rely heavily on support from registration fees.
“We didn’t know 
what the final numbers were going to be from the [UC] Office of the President, so we went through everything and just prioritized it from highest to lowest, ” Bournoutian said. “That way we would have infor-mation to make informed decisions on what we think are the services that would really impact the students the most. ”
The committee chose to vary the 
level of cuts by program rather than simply cutting all programs evenly 
across the board. 
“We looked at every-
thing to see what was the highest priority based on number of students served, other funding sources, basically its rela-tionship with the mission of the university, whether or not other programs exist on campus that can serve those same needs, ” Bournoutian said. “We try to preserve those things that only exist with that registration fee funding. ”
Next year, the campus 
expects to face similar cuts, leaving the commit-tee in a similar position. 
“More cuts are going to be com-
ing down the pipeline next year, ” Committee Chair Erik Van Esselsytn said. “We’re going to have to do the same sort of priority list for those as well. ” 
On Oct. 23, UC President Mark 
G. Yudof officially announced a pro-posal to raise student fees 32 percent  by Fall Quarter 2010. 
“In the next couple years, all the 
fees are going to go up by a substantial amount, ” Van Esselsytn said. “The cuts coming through the state are huge, and they’re not expected to let up anytime in the next two years. Really the only way to make up lack of funds is to raise fees. ” 
He said the Registration Fee 
Advisory Committee will aim to protect valuable student services despite the reductions. 
“For the benefit of all students, I 
think the [registration] fees should only be used for things related to student life, ” Van Esselsytn said. “One of the dangers is that the UC system as a whole in raising its fees is going to start to use the registration fees to cover the stuff that has lost funding because of the state cuts. I don’t agree with that, but that’s not to say it’s not going to go happen. It’s not within a single committee on one campus’ power to keep that from happening. ”

It’s no secret that we the stu-
dents — bio-book worms, co-op art freaks and sorority 
sisters for all — stand disunited. Aside from sweaty Sun God Festival elbow rubs once a year and starved solidarity in the never-ending Goody’s burrito line, there isn’t much reason for all of us to hang out on a Friday night. 
A.S. President Utsav Gupta 
wants to end UCSD’s loner legacy, and he thinks he’s got just the pill: a Triton football team. 
While the prospect of 
tomorrow’s aerospace engineers and baristas alike gathering ’round for a 
pregame tailgate holds 
a certain old-school 
collegiate charm, there’s one little detail in particular we can’t ignore, at least for now: those trident-emblazoned helmets and the myriad of 
costs that go along with them.
Gupta is convinced otherwise. 
He estimates that creating a Division-II football team could cost as little as $1 million annually (no more than the total price we pay to keep UC President Mark G. Yudof and the campus loop shuttle around).  
After last spring’s A.S. election 
— which included a poll asking students whether they’ d support the creation of a football team, and how much they’ d pay for it — Gupta is also sure that most of the campus is on board, too. The only problem with those statistics — and the inevitable meager turnout to vote on the football referendum — is that less than a quarter of the student body could even be bothered to vote. True, a 73-percent majority of those spirited few did vote in football’s favor — but the poll question, of course, gave no specifics as to how the hypothetical team would come to reality. 
The survey went 
on to reveal that over 35 percent of students wouldn’t be willing to pay a cent for a football program. Which should be a major red flag, considering that long before hopping in the pickup and cracking open a pregame Bud Light, we’ d have to open our wallets pretty wide — certainly wider than that impossibly undershot $1 million figure might necessitate. UCLA, for comparison’s sake, spent $16 million on football in 2004 — and a scoreboard alone runs for about 
$500,000.
Gupta might not know exactly 
how pricey a football program 
would be, but he can’t deny it would be a huge blow for any hurting budget. Though the details of his football referendum — which he plans to complete by this spring’s A.S. election — aren’t yet public, making ours a school of pom-poms 
and Friday night lights wouldn’t be 
nearly as cheap or simple a task as some (well, mostly Gupta) would like to believe.He envisions transforming our 
current track and field facility to host football games in its spare time. But just throwing a couple goal posts around the track wouldn’t solve the field issue: With over 140 student runners already using the facility, there isn’t nearly enough space to accommodate a 60- to 70-person football team — not to mention in the locker room, which would get real cozy real fast.
Another big one? Under Title 
IX, a national law in place since 1972, there must be an equal number of male and female athletes at every high school and college. Though Gupta has said he’ d opt 
to add more women to our program, he hasn’t figured this cost into the final price tag. Ultimately, additional female players would up the referendum fee — and with the devastating academic cuts we’re facing, now isn’t the time to be increasing our fees for frills.
Even if money were 
no object and Gupta’s 
just-add-water plan were free of gaping holes in logic, a Division-II football team would have one sole competitor in all of California: Humboldt State University. Their team, the Lumberjacks, has a 
mighty four home games scheduled 
for this year; the rest, naturally, are out of state. After a few snoozeworthy Lumberjack-Triton face-offs, our team, too, would be forced to jet across the country. We can just see the TritonLink bill now.
By no means would we be able 
to smear paint across our cheeks and hop over to SDSU on a Friday 
night to show them what we’re 
made of. Supporting the Tritons would more likely require hopping on a Boeing 757 to Dixie State — unless anyone’s down for another road trip to Utah.
Gupta says that when you think 
of big schools, you think football — which, in the case of UC Berkeley, UCLA and USC, might be true. But those schools have ancient programs whose finances were built into the system long ago. A hastily concocted Division-II football team wouldn’t edge us closer to their prestige; it would simply be interpreted as a poorly conceived, transparent catch-up effort to overshadow our nerdier strengths. 
Considering the $234 yearly hike 
in campus athletic fees — voted on by students in a Winter Quarter 2007 referendum — that doubled our annual sports budget to $3.5 million, it’s clear that UCSD values athletics. Y et a more reasonable first move than declaring the second coming of UCSD football, and asking students for even more money, would be to set our sights onto making the jump to Division-I for our current athletic lineup. 
This, too, would be a costly 
move. But it makes far more sense to invest in already-successful teams than to roll the dice on a nonexis-tent one. Our 1968 foray into the football arena resulted in seven consecutive losses and no wins. We pulled the plug that year before embarrassing ourselves any further — and if forty years have made us any wiser, we’ll keep doing what we do best.

Welcome to a brand-
spankin’-new column written by the most 
politically disenchanted political-science major you’ll ever meet.  
I was reminded of my frustration 
with factional partisan politics just this past Monday morning, when I stepped onto the shuttle and The Rush Limbaugh Show was blasting at full volume, subjecting the entire bus of sleepy students to Limbaugh’s infuriating conservative lunacy.  
His vein-popping claim of the 
day was that President Obama is intentionally eliminating jobs. Hey, what president wouldn’t deliberately sabotage his country? 
I closed my eyes and tried in vain 
to ignore his sniggering tone. My eyelid twitched spastically. This is not what I needed at 10 a.m., trying to cram the final details of an obscure 18th-century French painter for my impending art-history midterm.  
My beef with American politics 
is by no means reserved for the right-wing. I’m equally repulsed by leftist commentary, like that of former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean, who claimed to “hate the Republicans and everything they stand for” in 2005. 
Political pundits’ desire to see 
the world as a black-and-white, hyperpolarized battlefield between the left and the right evokes images of muddy-faced brats pulling each other’s hair on playgrounds — not of educated adults. 
Interestingly, Dean followed up his 
declaration by saying that he admires the Republicans’ discipline and organization. And he should. Though I identify with most Democratic ideology, the party is paralyzed by internal bickering and unable to focus on much-needed policy change. 
Even with a popular Democrat in 
the White House and a Democratic majority in both houses of Congress, the party is so mired by internal conflict that it isn’t even able to pass a bill to reform national health care — something for which most Americans are hankering, and rightly so.
Liberal ineffectiveness runs 
even more rampant on a local level. Y esterday’s campuswide press conference against cutbacks to Cal Grants boasted a crowd of 15 people.
In large part, it’s because the 
average student is turned off by extremism — and rightly so.
Instead of comparing Mark G. 
Yudof to Hitler or holding up signs with confusing declarations such as 
“Fees Are Racist, ” activists should be 
doing more to educate all those too busy studying biochemistry to write a letter to their local legislator or walk out of their class in protest.
An ability to inspire people to 
care about what’s going on around them and a willingness to negotiate with the “other side” without resorting to inflammatory rhetoric 
works. It’s how Martin Luther King 
Jr. slowly eroded away centuries of racism and segregation. It’s how Barack Hussein Obama became President. And it’s the only way to work toward change on this campus.   Assembly

Dear Editor, 
I am excited to announce the Web 
site The Little Black Book (www.thelb-
bucsd.com) for the students of UCSD. This Web site offers various services with the intention of creating infinite opportunities for students to meet. It will give each student a chance to venture out of his or her dorm, suite, apartment or closed social clique. It will give students the opportunity to  
be matched with one of the thousands of other students at our campus after quickly and easily creating an anony-mous profile. 
My goal with this Web site is 
to give students a steady stream of matches of whichever types of stu-dents they so desire. This site can really cater to any social demand. Whether you are interested in dat-ing, hooking up, making new friends, networking or venturing on a blind date (try our Daring Pairing service), you should become a member of the Little Black Book for a year’s worth of student matches.  
This site is meant to be fun. But 
it can also play an important role in preparing us for life after college. A huge part of college is learning how to interact with others. We need to know how to socialize in various settings and the scary fact is: Employers know UCSD as the school that produces graduates that lack this essential skill. 
The Little Black Book is killing 
two birds (maybe more) with one stone. It will balance your life and will also push you to be the best that you can be — the only thing that looks better than a UCSD graduate is a well-rounded  UCSD graduate!
The deep rooted goal for this Web 
site is to enable the nearly 30,000 students to make the most of their college life while at UCSD. Y ou want to be able to look back on this saga of life and remember all the experiences and story-worthy memories. So, I urge you to check out The Little Black Book — the site will be up and fully running soon.
—James Carroll

Between main outfit Deerhunter’s 
kraut-punk and solo project Atlas Sound’s bedroom dream-pop, 
Bradford Cox gets around. The 28-year-old Atlanta native just released his second proper LP , Logos — a stunning collection 
of singles/concepts without any greater ambition to be a statement record.
He told to the A.V . Club back in 
August that he wanted each track to stand alone, “like a collage or a photo album — 
snapshots from a lot of places. ” Listening 
to the finished recording conjures memo-ries from last year, when I was obsessed with all things Bradford — right around the time a half-finished sketch of Logos  
accidentally leaked and Cox considered abandoning the project entirely.
I decided I’ d pay tribute to the dude 
who’ d given me a wealth of sweet music and ideas over the past few years — well over 100 free songs on deerhuntertheband.
blogspot.com  — by culling the top eight 
Bradford blog tracks in what I call the Atlas Sound Steezy Hits Mixtape .
1. “Coffin Trick .” Let’s start with 
a spooky number that shuffles and jangles, as Cox calls us to “the coffin 
that awaits you. ” Released last October as a quick Halloween treat, the song repeats its eerie, raw melody over acoustic arpeggios until the lo-fi tech climaxes with all the blown-out overdubs. 
2. “Game of Diamonds (Atlas Sound 
Demo). ” This cut might be familiar to 
some: Deerhunter released a mellow island version of it on this year’s Rainwater 
Cassette Exchange . Cox’s first sketch of 
“Diamonds” maintains the Motown and shoegaze aesthetic he tends to gravitate toward; it’s oddly captivating despite its utilitarian nature.
3. “Holiday. ” Another entry in his 
lineup of sexual-stalker themes, “Holiday” is part of a Virtual 7” series that Cox 
helmed for digital consumption, each iteration containing its own A and B Side. This creepy guitar ballad repeats lines like “I hold the knife to your perfect fucking face” and “I know your parents are away/ So I’ll come over/ We’ll have a perfect holi-day. ” It’s brutal, but Cox manages to make it near-endearing.
4. “Rendered. ” Part of How I Escaped 
the Prison of Fractals,  an ’06 self-released 
CDR that Cox pushed locally and then re-upped on his blog in ’08, “Rendered” cap-tivates from the first fuzzy chord strum. The rest of the song is decent, but the first three seconds — “Two hours back, ” Cox whispers, and then the guitar rushes in — are truly sick.
5. “So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go 
Bad). ” This tasty Everly Brothers cover 
proves that Cox could build an entire career morphing timeless ballads into twisted girl-group Motown. The bouncy 
beat, the reverb, the distortion, the sadness 
— it hits that sweet spot.
6. “ Activation .” Uploaded at a crazy-
prolific period in early ’08 when Cox was releasing new tunes on a daily basis, “ Activation” is a standout on his Orange 
Ohms Glow EP. The classic acoustic progression and delivery of lines like “ Activation in the abyss/ Mouth on mouth was catalyst” make it a welcome addition 
to Steezy Hits.Suburban    Steez
CHRIS KOKIOUSIS
ckokious@ucsd.edu
See STEEZ, page 8Back in fall 2004, 
Warren College senior Tristan Newcomb found himself in a slacker’s dilemma. 
He had signed up for an extra-credit group project in lecturer Brett Stalbaum’s introductory Computing in the Arts course, but — after a couple of distracted, Perrier-fueled meetings — he soon realized he and his class-mates were nowhere near moti-vated enough to develop the video game they’ d promised. 
“We’re art students getting 
high on fizzy water — so there was no way we were going to sud-denly go around the clock trying to finish this thing, ” Newcomb said. “ And so we came up with the idea that we were going to have to fake it … We’re going to have to fake it in such a way that the fak-ing it was better than if we’ d ever done anything real. ”
So Newcomb recorded some 
video footage of himself and other group members navigating what he considers to be the worst student-developed video game ever created. Location: gas station on a floating island. Character set: a few indiscriminate Lego men and SpongeBob SquarePants. The objective: to fetch a golden orb and exchange it for gasoline. 
On top of it all, Tristan decid-
ed to present the footage to his peers as if it were an actual class project, using a DVD to simulate live laptop projection of the game.
At first, it was just a way to 
dodge the real assignment. But once the students started rehears-ing their performance — a string of computer glitches followed by a full-fledged emotional breakdown, courtesy of Newcomb, as instable programmer guy — they realized their hoax could be so much more than a scapegoat.
However, before they could 
perform it in public, they needed the go-ahead from professor Stalbaum.
“They were concerned with 
the ethical dimensions of the deception, or — possibly closer to the truth — they were more concerned whether I would allow it in my class, ” Stalbaum said. “They asked me if it was OK, and essentially, I only had to give them permission to do something dar-ing … Sometimes, that is all an art teacher needs to do. ”
The day of their first perfor-
mance went swimmingly — or horribly, depending on which end of the room you were facing.  Playing the student program-mer, Newcomb floundered as his shoddy software “froze” on the projector screen, and he took to 
filling the awkward pauses with 
bizarre puppet videos and existen-tial monologues.
Still, his student audience 
remained numb.
“ As soon as [students] see 
technical glitches in a presenta-tion, they begin to disconnect and they go into the world of the laptop or the iPhone, ” Newcomb 
said. “It fed into all their secret 
expectations that this was going to be a train wreck anyway. ”
On that fateful day in 2004, 
the Gaming Response Resource Foundation was born. Since then, Tristan has performed before a collection of visual arts courses at UCSD. Some involved par-ticipation from Stalbaum himself; others unraveled the elaborate story of a fictitious GPS student-tracking system meant to curb UCSD’s supposedly severe hit-and-runs rate.
There was even one 2005 
performance in which Newcomb forced a painstaking lecture on a crowd of Sixth College orientees.
“That was the one where Brett 
had to run interference for us because the Sixth College provost wanted to stop the performance, ” Newcomb said. “Everyone in the room thinks it’s real — only we and Brett know that it’s fake. And once we flounder for 24 minutes — and it has to be 24 minutes, because the DVD that’s playing on the screen behind us is 24 
minutes — we can’t stop it. The 
train’s going down the track and there’s no way to get it off the rails or to get it to stop without giving it away. So we’re having to consis-tently flounder, and the provost is looking more and more irritated [at] us, and really disappointed with Brett because he isn’t stop-ping this. ”
In the end, Stalbaum 
convinced the provost that Newcomb’s presentation would teach students an important les-son on technical difficulties, and he was able to wrap up the show without interruption.
After a five-year stretch of 
GRRF performances, Newcomb has partnered with Eleanor 
Roosevelt College senior Simon 
Quiroz and Revelle College senior Roberto Rosales to launch Lumalin Productions — a film

THE SOUND OF SUICIDE
POSTPONEMENT
Newcomb teams with UCSD professor 
Brett Stalbaum to spoof malfunction-ing GPS phones in what is perhaps his most infamous video. The starring fake offers a concerning statistic: UCSD, apparently, is the systemwide champion for hit-and-runs, as a result of its bizarre “topology.” In fact, Newcomb admits to witnessing a student being hit by a car — and describes it in uncomfortable detail. He goes on to explain his proposal: a video-game-inspired student tracking system. Sweet.For a spinoff of Trsitan Newcomb’s former Student-Run Television program “Live Hot Puppet Chat,” his Lispy Dog puppet goes medival in an extremely rough interpretation of King Arthur’s quest for knighthood. Featuring — but not limited to — psychadelic moving backdrops, rambling inner-reasoning and a banana with bad facial hair claiming to be an ex-cop.

THE LAST LECTURE
In this GRRF episode, Newcomb poses as a software engineer mourning the loss of a student he holds dear to his heart. As usual, technical difficulties are thrown into the mix, and Newcomb resorts to cueing a video of “a cats-running-full-speed-into-table-legs kind of thing,” which ends up being a pup-pet rambling about Tetris. Newcomb then admits to posting a video online in which he claims to be a profes-sor giving his last lecture before he dies — an admittedly “awkward” move after he realized he mistakenly diagnosed his illness as fatal.LIVE HOT PUPPET CHAT’S SWORD OF DIGESTIVE CALMNESSGRRF

In hopes of catching the haunting on ﬁlm, the pair sets up surveillance cameras around their house — and we get to witness the frightening events unfold. Not impressed?

Renowned French film 
director and photographer Agnès Varda (“Cleo from 
5 to 7”) steps in front of the camera in this autobiographi-cal documentary about her life as an artist. Shot like a living scrapbook, “The Beaches of Agnès” is a hodgepodge of anecdotes, photographs, home videos, interviews, art and clips from her filmic repertoire that combine to encompass her identity and how she views the world. At the outset, the 81-year-
old introduces the natural framework of her life: the beach. Throughout the film, she explores the ways in which her sense of self was created on and around the timeless sea — from Sète, France, to Venice Beach. 
Known for her innova-
tive art installations, Varda frequently shows off an eye for finding the extraordinary within the ordinary, setting up mirrors on the sand to capture the angles of the ocean and rec-reating black-and-white pho-tographs from her childhood with modern-day child actors.

La Paloma Theatre in North County carries on its annual Halloween 
tradition this weekend with a special screening of 1975 classic “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.” Based on Richard O’Brien’s musical, the ﬁlm follows a sing-songy pair of lovebirds (Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon) who ﬁnd themselves stranded at a mad scientist’s castle. There, the two meet a peculiar group of characters, all devoted to head of the household Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), from the planet of Transsexual. As the questionable professional helps the couple reveal their hidden desires, they are forced to examine their true sexuality — a true-blue shoutout to the sexual liberation movement of the ’70s. Unforgettable song-and-dance numbers will spring to life at La Paloma, where a live cast promises to spruce the sex scenes. (JB)“THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW”

Just in case your stomach couldn’t make it past the ﬁrst “Saw” installment, here’s an update: Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), the series’ ﬁrst red-bowed torturer, was killed in “III,” autopsied in “IV” and is somehow still kicking — ahem, rolling — in “VI.” While it’s unlikely that new fans will be recruited by the latest, cult followers will undoubtedly dig the revamped collection of torture machines, puzzles and toys. This time around, though, selected victims are mortgage lenders and health-insurance adjusters rather than people who simply don’t appreciate life. It’s all about timeliness, right? Heh.

The massive block party features 10 local DJs and three bands, performing on three stages throughout the night. If you’re planning to go all out costume-wise, enter the contest and you might just go home with a $3,000 cash prize. A ticket buys entrance to over 30 bars in the area, so there’s a good chance you’ll need to take the free designated-driver shuttle home. (JS)MONSTER BASH

They lost everyone but frontman Andrew 
Stockdale, and they took four years to release a followup to their debut — yet somehow, 
Wolfmother’s new Cosmic Egg  still sounds like the 
second coming of hard rock.
The old trio slammed the airwaves with hits like 
“Joker and the Thief ” back in high school, but with the lineup change, the bat-outta-hell sonic assault is gone. Instead, Stockdale has crafted a bluesy, mea-sured sound straight out of Jimmy Page’s garage.
First single “New Moon Rising” starts off quiet 
and void, its verses carried by a hollow drumbeat and muted guitars, but explodes into a blues-heavy, bring-the-house-down chorus to kick-start Egg. Of 
course, good rock ‘n’ roll always has a little bit of the devil in it, and these guitars grind with a dose of tuned-down Sabbath grunge — a heavy contrast to Stockdale’s wail.
Album standout “White Feather, ” though, is pure 
heaven. The choppy rhythm guitar pops along while the lead equivalent rambles in never-ending solo, ringing pure and clean all the way through the final chorus. Stockdale can’t write interesting lyrics to save his soul anymore, unfortunately, but some skipping Keith Moon drums more than make up for it.
The best part? Each of 12 tracks has the hard-rock 
spirit of Led Zeppelin, and the whole lot runs for over an hour of heavy blues. Sure, Stockdale needs to think twice before escalating his wail to an earsplit-ting shriek, but there’s no question that Egg deserves a 
whole lotta love.

Hard Rock? Hallelujah!
The Swell Season’s Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova may have been produced on an indie-pop assembly line, so perfectly do they melt into the genre’s cookie-cutter mold. Cute and foreign? Check 
— he’s an Irish singer and she’s a Czech pianist. Stars of a sweet, quiet cult film? Check — they were the nameless protagonists in 2007’s Irish musical “Once, ”  which spawned Oscar-winning hit “Falling Slowly. ” 
On-again off-again tension in the studio? Check — they briefly dated before making the film and subsequently broke up (pay attention to this one, it’s important).
It’s hard not to dwell on the possibility of true-life romance through-
out the pair’s disjointed new Strict Joy . Hansard and Irglova take turns 
supplying the album’s vocals, each singing from a markedly different place; as the album progresses and their lyrics alternate, how not to fanta-size it as one long duet, chronicling two sides of a complicated love story?
Hansard has one particularly intense moment of moodiness dur-
ing “In These Arms, ” in which his whispers and understated whines bemoan a failed relationship. Mostly, though, he specializes in cheerful songs of celebration a la “Back Broke” and “Feeling the Pull. ” They’re mind-numbingly upbeat, with just-complex-enough background noise and simple, swooping vocals that invoke nothing so much as the jubila-tion of being free.
In contrast, Irglova puts her songbird to good use with downbeat 
medidations on sadness like “Fantasy Man” and “I Have Loved Y ou Wrong, ” alternating between dreams of an imaginary lover and apologies for the harm she has inflicted on the one sitting next to her. (We assume. And hope.)
The two narratives meld together in the final and best song of the 
album, “The Verb, ” on which the two lament: “I’m tired of fighting she said/ Y our words just rattle my head/ All  joy escapes in the dark/ And I can’t make this make sense. ” It’s OK, guys — we’ve got no problem filling in the blanks.

Somewhere in the midst of toying with side group Megapuss and sleeping with Natalie Portman, freaky folker Devendra Banhart managed to churn out some cuts for seventh studio 
album What Will We Be . Unfortunately, the effort doesn’t live 
up to the tinge of eccentricity we’ve come to expect from the listener-friendly hippie.
Either he’s been spending a lot of time blazing in Topanga 
Canyon or recently reached BFF status with Jack Johnson, because Banhart’s freak flag is flying half-mast at best. Topping out at 14 tracks (all his other albums have run between 16 and 22), What Will We Be sees Banhart treading dangerously close to 
main-mainstream.
The album begins with a few upbeat numbers, sprinkled with 
cheery lyrics that achieve warm fuzzies without giving way to nausea. “Can’t Help But Smiling” showcases slow, suave vocals on a smooth melody of drums, shakers and tinkery piano keys, making it almost impossible not to flash a few pearly whites. The folkie even dabbles in foreign languages on a few tracks, keeping up his charming hipster image.
Everything goes smoothly until mid-album, where the beat 
slows and shit starts to really drag. Both “First Song for B” and “Last Song for B” (yeah, he gets over B pretty quick) are lone-some, downright depressing piano ballads with the same effect as Jude Law’s receding hairline — they instantly make the whole package a lot less attractive.
Final track “Foolin” is somewhat of a saving grace — an honest 
attempt at letting our spirits free — but after having been rocked to sleep, we hardly notice the Banhart’s recovery from depression. In other words, the album wastes a solidly entertaining start with a terrible second half. Let’s just hope this isn’t a peek into his bland new crystal ball.

7. “My Car .” Apparently, the worst 
symptom of touring is “the homesick-ness” — a subject that prompted Cox to release the Things I’ll Miss EP last year. Lead stunner “My Car” warps and bends electric notes over an omi-nous bass-drum punch as Cox pines for his white whip.
8. “Dog Y ears (Ghetto Cross) .” For my final mixtape pick, I chose a Hotlanta collab between Cox and Black Lips lead singer/songwriter Cole Alexander, together Ghetto Cross. Alexander commands slurry vocal duties in “Dog Y ears” with freestyles about how he’s “got the mad skills of a fuck-up” as Cox coos in the back-ground, giving a dreamy tinge to the proceedings.

Based on the life of Sandra Laing, 
“Skin” is the story of a black woman born into a family of 
white Afrikaners in apartheid-era South Africa. Raised as culturally white, Sandra (Sophie Okonedo, “The Secret Life of Bees”) struggles to define herself amid her parents’ expectation that she marry a white Afrikaner. 
Although 
Anthony Fabian’s film is framed by racial conflict, it succeeds by transcend-ing what is expected of an apartheid biopic, emerging with an empowering feminist message from a meditation on love, family, betrayal, reconciliation and the self. 
Bookended with textured footage 
of South Africa’s first free elections in 1991 and starring actors who look like photocopies of their real-life counterparts (we catch a glimpse at the end), the film nearly masquerades as a documentary, leaving us to won-der whether we’re just sitting through a collection of someone else’s home videos. 
While Okonedo, the film’s only 
big-name star, fails to steal the screen from Alice Krige — who shines as Sandra’s mother Sannie — she brings Sandra’s emotional turmoil to life with an expressionless face and body language that betrays her character’s physical insecurities. The mother-daughter relationship are explored throughout, as both characters are tested by the 
stubborn cruelty of Sandra’s father (Sam Neill). 
The story begins when a young 
Sandra (Ella Ramangwane) is sent to boarding school. The color of her skin immediately subjects her to peer abuse, and after being re-classified as “colored” by the school doctor, Sandra is expelled. Maddened by the decision, her father takes the issue to the Supreme Court, asking his daugh-ter be permanently classified as white. But as the girl reaches adulthood, she realizes that no matter what her birth certificate says, the world will always identify her as black. 
Rebelling against her domineer-
ing parents, Sandra runs away with a young black man named Petrus (Tony Kgoroge). Disowned by her father, she must forge her own path out-side of the society in which she was raised. Her mother, meanwhile, is left behind to weather a marriage turning increasingly bitter with the years. 
It is only when Sannie is torn 
between a duty-bound love for her husband and enduring sadness at the departure of her daughter that Krige becomes a profoundly conflicted — and finally interesting — character, 
letting some of the film’s most power-ful themes of betrayal and reconciliation come to the forefront.
It is only 
after Sandra has broken free of the masculine grip on her life that 
she is able to forge her own sense of self. The film’s powerful voice on tol-erance, love and identity make “Skin” more than just a bra-burning soap-box, and instead a thought-provok-ing take on the human experience.

in its quiet humility, as Varda amus-
ingly waddles backward down the street to visually demonstrate her movement into the past. The film is entirely in French: An English-speaking audience is asked to read along as the pop-up book unfolds with fantastical characters — including a troupe of acrobats, Harrison Ford and an animated Cheshire cat that speaks like a robot alien.
While these various digressions 
are at times erratic and difficult to follow, Varda creates smooth transi-tions between the stages of her life, gluing each segment to the next with the sound of a door creaking or images of gondola-jousting. 
From life as a young girl to cin-
ematic force — and, finally, wrapped in a love affair with fellow director and husband Jacques Demy — Varda reconstructs her own history by visiting the actors who appeared in her films, floating down the Seine in a yellow sailboat and setting up her production company’s office in an outdoor sandbox. 
But Varda is a character in her-
self. With a red-and-silver bowl cut, the body of a matryoshka doll and the swagger of a mallard, she tells of her futile efforts to be a joyful femi-nist, her fascination with the Black Panthers, her love for the plastic colors of summer and the feeling of helplessness that overcame her as Demy succumbed to AIDS. 
The biggest beauty of the film, 
however, lies in the fact that we do not need to know anything about Varda to appreciate her artistic eccentricities and innate goofiness. So relax and allow Schubert to fill your head as one of French cinemas’ greats guides you through the life of an artist — to a place where fact and fiction, collide and complement one another in delicate harmony.The ﬁlm nearly 
masquerades as a documentary, leaving us to wonder whether we’re just sitting through acollection of someone else’s home videos.

UCSDGUARDIAN.CAMPUSAVE.COMSPORTS THURSDAY , OCTOBER 29, 2009  THE UCSD GUARDIAN 11 
and made it difficult for players to see the turf and 
for goalies to track shots on goal. 
The Coyotes’ first goal came in the 69th minute. 
The Tritons answered back a quick five minutes later, when junior midfielder Shane Micheil nailed  his fourth goal of the season from 30 yards away. 
Despite UCSD’s comeback, a game-winning 
Coyote goal sealed the Triton defeat. 
In their Oct. 25 game against Cal Poly Pomona, 
the Tritons’ offense had no answer to the superior Bronco defense. The Broncos managed to eek out the game’s lone point for a narrow victory. 
“[It was] a bit of an uninteresting game, ” senior 
midfielder Jonathan Sawyer said.
Pomona’s only score came just after halftime, in 
the 47th minute, as senior forward Kevin Ramirez knocked a rebound shot past senior goalkeeper Peter Akman into the lower left corner of the net. 
Each team notched six shots apiece in the first half. Triton junior midfielder Shane Micheil and senior forward Tony Choi led the way with two attempts each. 
The Tritons have dealt with a frustrating year, 
all seven losses have been decided by a single goal. 
The team’s annual Senior Day will take place at 
a Nov. 1 home game against Cal State Dominguez Hills. Seven graduating student athletes will be honored for their accomplishments on and off the field before a final home game in Triton uniforms. The graduating seniors are Akman, Choi, Sawyer; midfielders Scott Gressard and Kyle Parton; and defenders Chris Guitierrez and Daniel Pavitt.
The Tritons will be  back in action Friday to host 
No. 7 Cal State University Los Angeles at 4:30 p.m. The Golden Eagles boast an impressive 15-2-1 over-all record and an 11-2-1 mark in the CCAA.

▶ M. SOCCER, MYVTWHNLAlong with assessing the student body’s interest, 
the survey asked how much students would be will-
ing to pay in additional fees to support the creation of a football team. 35.59 percent of students said they were not willing to pay any money at all. The remaining students expressed — on average — that they would be willing to take on an extra $19.46 per quarter to create a Triton football program.
Gupta said he has taken the current University 
of California budget crisis into consideration in planning the football referendum. 
“Things are tough, and you’re forced to priori-
tize, ” Gupta said. “I think that if a football referen-dum can survive in this market, then it does show support within the student body. Sure, there’s more likelihood for it to fail than it probably would have three years ago, but I think that students can make value judgments as to where their money wants to go. This is not us forcing a fee on the student body — this is us asking students what they want. ”
Gupta said a UCSD football team could provide 
students with a necessary and missing component of the traditional college experience.
“When people think of big schools, they think 
of football teams, ” Gupta said. “We have a super majority saying that they would actually pay to support a team. ”
In researching the feasibility of a football team, 
Gupta worked with Vice Chancellors Steven Relyea and Penny Rue to come up with an estimated bud-get. He produced an estimated figure of $1 million to 2 million a year — a total that Gupta sees as compatible with what students are willing to pay, based on last spring’s survey.
While Senior Associate Athletic Director Ken 
Grosse said he would support a UCSD football team, he also expressed concerns about its logistics.
“There are all the start-up costs that we’ d be 
looking at: the equipment, the additional people that are working here, ” Grosse said. “We don’t even have room now to store what we need to. It’ d be great to have a team, [but] I just don’t see it working. ”
UCSD currently plays at the NCAA Division-
II level. Because Humboldt State University is the only other D-II school in California, the UCSD football team would have to travel to other states in order to play games — adding additional travel costs to basic program needs.
“There are only a dozen D-II schools west of 
the Mississippi, so you’re talking about some pretty heavy travel costs, ” Grosse said.
Grosse added that in the past decade, only a few 
colleges have successfully created a football team. According to Grosse, these examples cannot be compared to UCSD, because two of the schools — the University of Connecticut and the University of South Florida —already ran powerhouse Division-I athletic programs before hand, and had existing 
funds and facilities to support the new team. 
Another obstacle in a UCSD football team’s 
future would be Title IX, a national law created in 1972 that requires men and women’s athletic teams at the high-school and collegiate levels must remain in equal balance. As stipulated by Title IX, there must be an even number of male and female athletes at any one institution. This means that if UCSD were to add a men’s football team — which would require anywhere from 60 to 90 student ath-letes according to Grosse — the university would have to add the same number of female athletes or subtract from the men’s total. 
Grosse sees Title IX as an impossible obstacle. “We’re in compliance with Title IX right now, ” 
Grosse said. “So if you add a football team, we’ d have to do one of two things: Y ou either make an equivalent addition on the women’s side or cut the equivalent on the men’s side. For how much foot-ball is going to cost, you’re talking about decimat-ing the men’s program. At least four or five teams would have to go. ”
Gupta said he is aware of Title IX, but remains 
optimistic.
“The idea that we’ d want to cut men’s teams to 
make room for football is simply not true, ” Gupta said. “What we’ d be after is creating women’s teams. ”
Gupta does not currently include any such 
details in his planned referendum. 
In terms of home-game location, Gupta’ envi-
sions the use of the Triton Track and Field Stadium. 
“The track and field was actually constructed 
with the foresight of allowing a regulation football field, ” Gupta said. “ All you’ d have to do is get rid of the inner jogging track and make a small adjust-ment to the track, and you’ d have a regulation foot-ball stadium. ”
Men’s track and field coach Tony Salerno said 
that adding a football team to the space would present several problems.
“The stadium is not configured for football, so 
there’s no goalposts or a scoreboard, ” Salerno said. “We have just over 100 [athletes] in track. Facility issues would be complex. ”
If students pass the referendum this Spring 
Quarter, Gupta believes that the football team could officially begin play by Fall Quarter of 2011.
“It would take time to get coaches, to start train-
ing players and recruiting, ” Gupta said. “I think that that would take about a year to do. ”

MEN’S SOCCER — The UCSD men’s 
soccer team continued its slide last weekend, falling in a pair of one-goal 
games at home against Cal State San 
Bernardino and Cal Poly Pomona on Oct. 23 and Oct. 25, respectively. The Tritons’ losing streak now stands at four games, leaving them 7-7-4 overall and 4-7-3 in the California Collegiate Athletic Association play.
The Tritons made a late-game 
push but lost 2-1 against Cal State San Bernardino. Two days later, they 
couldn’t notch a single point against 
Cal Poly Pomona, and lost 1-0. 
Despite a strong defensive effort for 
two-thirds of the match, the Tritons   swallowed a tough loss after allowing two Coyote goals over the final 20 minutes. A thick fog engulfed the field .W]Z\P

SWIMMING & DIVING — The 
Tritons inaugurated the newly 
repaired Canyon View Aquatic Center with a victory against their visiting Claremont-Mudd-Scripps opponents at the UCSD swim team’s Oct. 24 2009-10 season-opening meet.
“I am very happy where we are 
at as far as racing, ” head coach Scott McGihon said. “This was an out-standing first meet. ”
The Triton women emerged 
with a dominant 180-115 win, while 
the men’s team scored an equally 
impressive 197-97 victory over the Claremont-Mudd-Scripps swim-mers.
Collectively, the UCSD swim-
mers and divers won 23 of the day’s 32 events.
The Tritons had multiple win-
ners in several individual events. Freshman Katherine Tse and senior 
Daniel Perdew both took the 50- and 100-yard freestyle heats for the 
Tritons, while junior Anju Shimura won the 100- and 200-yard back-stroke events. Additionally, fresh-man Bethany Dong and senior Jereme Barnett-Woods both won the 500- and 1000-yard distance events.
The relay teams on both sides 
were equally successful. Shimura partnered with teammates Tse, sophomore Mercedes O’Brien and junior Jessica Ferguson to win the 200-medley relay with a time of 1:48.87. 
The men’s team — which includ-
ed Perdew, freshman Julius Espiritu, seniors Juan Pablo Carillo and Todd Langland — took the same event on the men’s side with a time of 1:34.05.
The meet marked the first official 
competition for the diving team. 
Freshman diver Tyler Runsten wast-
ed little time making an impact in his first NCCA competition, win-ning the men’s one-meter and three-meter diving events. 
He scored an impressive 290.85 
in the latter event — despite the fact that the diving team has been unable to practice their full rep-ertoire, because Canyon View had 
been closed for about a month.
“I wasn’t even sure what dives we 
were going to do, ” Runsten said. “We 
haven’t been diving three meters due to the pool situation, so I just went for big dives. I have no regrets. I am proud and happy. ”McGihon was particularly pleased with Runsten’s performance. 
“He was outstanding, ” McGihon 
said. “Considering it’s his first meet 
as a first-time freshman, [it was] 
very impressive. ” 
Runsten said his performance 
expectations can be credited to his team’s cohesion heading into the season.
“The team thus far has been a 
great experience, ” Runsten said. “I love this team. We hang out every night. ”
McGihon said he would like 
to continue developing the team’s 
dynamic, and is keeping his eye on of the long-term goal of making the NCAA National Competition.
“We need to work on our level 
of focus, ” McGihon said. “With the pool open, it’s better for everyone. We can enjoy some continuity and flow to training. We want to win these league meets, but preparing for the NCAA is the longer-term plan. ”
The UCSD swim and diving team 
will look to build on last Saturday’s results when they visit San Diego State on Nov. 6, where the Tritons 
will compete against hosts Aztecs 
and Texas Christian University.

Both the men’s and women’s teams defeated Harvey-Mudd-Scripps in UCSD’s first team home meet.With repairs to Canyon 
View pool finally finished, the swim and dive team made a victorious return.
Riding on the results of 
a survey on last Spring Quarter’s A.S. election bal-lot, A.S. president Utsav 
Gupta said a referendum to create a student-funded UCSD football team is currently in the works. Gupta aims to have the refer-endum on this Spring Quarter’s student ballot.  
According to Gupta, the sur-
vey showed that students not only want a football team, but are more than willing to pay for its creation.
Asked if they would sup-
port the creation of a Division-II Intercollegiate Football team, 72.65 percent of the 5,174 stu-dents who voted in the election said ‘Y es, ’ 17.75 percent voted no and 9.6 percent abstained.Back
