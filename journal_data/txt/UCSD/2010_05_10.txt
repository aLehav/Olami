California State University officials 
are developing new methods to push 
undergraduates through the system faster, in an effort to make room for new students.
Prompted by a significant decrease 
in state funding — which has led the CSU Board of Trustees to slash enroll-ment at each of the university’s 23 campuses — the new plan aims to free up space for incoming freshmen and transfer students by making it easier for existing students to graduate early.
According to CSU spokesperson 
Erik Fallis, the campuses are using academic advising to prevent students 
from switching majors — often requiring an entirely new set of gen-eral-education cours-es, hindering progress toward graduation.
In previous years, 
the CSU system received $11,075 per 
student from the state, but that figure has since dropped to $4,669 per stu-dent. As a result, the CSU system has slashed enrollment by 40,000 students since last year.
The enrollment crunch drew offi-
cials’ attention to a large population of super seniors — students with more than 144 academic credits. There are currently around 12,000 super seniors throughout the CSU system.
“We’re trying to work on reduc-
ing some of the barriers to student graduation, and to help move students along, ” Fallis said. 
He stressed, however, that the pro-
gram is not meant to push students out of the universities — rather, to prevent them from wasting time on unnecessary classes.
 “We know some students are going 
to take longer than six years, ” Fallis said. “This isn’t saying that students have to graduate within six years, but we’re working as much as we can to make it possible for students to graduate more quickly, and to have a clear road map of what they need to do to get a degree. ”
According to Fallis, CSU campuses 
have been working to reduce some degree programs to 120 units, evaluat-
ing various majors and deciding which 
of their requirements could be waived. 
“Not all of our programs are 120, ” 
Fallis said. “There are some that are

Students will continue to feel the effects of 
the UC budget crisis next year: Every last academic department on campus is bracing 
itself for a 10- to 20- percent cut in funding — and a resulting bareboned schedule of classes — for the 2010-11 academic year. 
“There are going to be a lot more cuts next 
quarter, in terms of less classes being offered, ” A.S. Campuswide Senator Bryant Pena said. “That’s why a lot of students ... when they’re signing up for classes, they’re going to have an even harder time. ” 
A.S. Campuswide Senator Katie Hall, who sits 
on the UCSD Planning and Budget Committee with several administrators, predicted that each department will distribute the cuts differently. For instance, according to Hall, all non-core laboratory classes in the biology department  — as well as class-es with under 100 students — will be cut completely.
“Each department is structured differently, ” she 
said last Wednesday at the student council meeting. “The result is that, when you cut from the engineer-ing department, you cut staff, but when you cut from the biology department, you cut classes. Next year will look different for each department. ”
A.S. Associate Vice President of Academic 
Affairs Jordan Taylor said the way the cuts mani-fest depends on how each department balances its administration, faculty members and classes.
“It’s left up to the departments how to deal with 
the cuts, ” he said. “ A lot of them with money in administration — those divisions will be able to cut and consolidate the administrative type of positions, The state deficit will hit harder 
than ever Fall Quarter, when UCSD’s academic departments receive a 10- to 20-percent cut.

competition for amateur snowboarders, skiers and
skateboarders — took place at Qualcomm
Stadium, instead of the usual Sun God Lawn. In 
order to bring the world of snow sports to Southern 
California, event organizers dropped 25 tons 
of snow into the parking lot to create a jibbing 
course, and invited skateboarders to compete for

Since its grand opening 
at the beginning of the year, the Village at Torrey Pines transfer housing has had a 
rough time selling itself.
Though Housing, Dining 
and Hospitality was banking on 
transfer-student selling points 
like on-campus convenience 
and granite countertops, the 
Village hasn’t filled nearly 
all its empty mattresses. Of 
the 1,060 beds available, 
approximately 200 are empty, 
according to A.S. Transfer 
Student Senator Adam 
Powers. Powers said the 
main reason transfer stu-
dents aren’t fighting over 
Village apartments is that 
they simply can’t afford 
the rent: between $1,200 
and $1,400 per month.
“I think the price bar-
rier kept a lot of students 
from living there — all 
the transfer students I 
spoke to, ” he said. “‘Why 
didn’t you live there?’ 
‘Price. ’ I didn’t hear any-
thing other than price. ”
As it turns out, 
cost was such a size-
able deterrent for 
transfer students this 
year that HDH has 
lowered prices for all 
units in the Village 
by nearly 9 percent 
for Fall Quarter.

UCSD scientists may be on the 
verge of the couch potato’s Holy Grail: 
a drug with all the benefits of exercise. 
Researchers are attempting to 
develop a pill that prevents obesity by increasing metabolic and respiration rates. In tests on mice, researchers removed FIH — the gene responsible for regulating the body’s response to low levels of oxygen — during the embryonic stage. 
When FIH was removed, research-
ers expected the mice to die as embry-os, as the enzyme affects developmen-tal genes. Instead, they acted like they were constantly at high altitudes, but were otherwise more fit than normal.
“We [removed the gene] think-
ing that the mouse would not survive past early embryogenesis, because we know [FIH is part of] a very impor-tant pathway [in controlling response to low oxygen], ” biology professor Randall Johnson said. “But it turned out the mouse was born, and was a bit healthier in some ways than a normal mouse. It is leaner and has less fat than a normal mouse. ”
Johnson’s lab found that mice with-
out FIH were constantly hyperventilat-ing — trying to increase their respira-tion to take in more oxygen — leading them to take in 20 to 40 percent more air than normal, while demonstrating a faster heart rate and drinking 30 to 40 percent more water. 
Because breathing burns calories, 
the mice developed faster metabo-lisms, protecting them from obesity.
The genetically altered mice had 
high insulin sensitivity, which reduces blood sugar and protects against weight gain induced by high-fat diets, and stayed lean. They were also small-er than the normal mice, since weight gain had been inhibited since birth.
However, the mice without the FIH 
gene experienced the same  side effects that are associated with “altitude sick-ness, ” or the result of moving quickly from low to high altitudes: hyperventi-lation, higher heart rates and anemia.
Johnson said that a drug could be 
developed to suppress FIH in order to treat obesity and diabetes for those who cannot exercise.
“There are people who are in such 
bad shape that they may need some drug to help them [in addition to] eat-ing less and exercising more, ” Johnson said. “Of course, changing lifestyles is a very important thing, but some people need immediate help. That’s one of the reasons why these drugs can be useful. ”
The lab is investigating whether 
known chemical compounds that also 
inhibit FIH have similar effects.
For humans, just triggering the 
body’s response to low oxygen levels may not prevent diabetes or obesity. The researchers will first have to dis-cover the specific amount of oxygen needed in order to metabolize food.

But for the most part,  we’re look ing to 
have 120 units be t he ge neral require-
ment for a bachelo r’s deg ree.”
Fallis added that each campu s will 
determin e its own num eric targets for 
increased grad uation rates. 
“The range is anything from pre-
parin g student s befo re they get into 
university through early start and EAP, 
to greater advising whe n they are stu-
dent s to urging student s who h ave 
much more units than they need in 
order to co mplete a bachelo r’s pro-
gram,” Fallis said. “[W e’ll be] advising 
those s tudent s on what major on what 
they want to complete and then help-ing them completely it in timely.”
CSU No rthridge h as taken the most 
extreme route, pulling federa l aid for 
students with ove r 150 credits, accord-
ing to the Ch
ronicle of Higher Education .
UC Off ice of the President  spokes-
person Lynn Tierney said the UC 
system is facing many  of t he same 
problem s as the CSU sy stem.
“With the state in such a terrible 
finan cial economic cri sis, it’s very hard 
for the C SU sy stem to absorb stu-
dent s,” Tierney said. “The whole s tate 
— co mmunity  colleges , state colleges 
and University of C alifornia — t hey’re 
tryin g to absorb as many  people as 
possible, so t hat they can get as many  
people in and educated as possible.”She added that similar changes 
could be imp lemented w ithin the UC 
system. The UC Bo ard of R egents 
recently began  reviewing a proposal to 
establish a three-year pathway, which 
migh t allow el igible student s to wai ve 
certain general-education courses.
“When you’re in an economic cri -
sis like this, nothing is off t he table,” 
Tierney said. “We’re look ing at every-
thing. If we’ re going to make a deci-
sion, [it] is going to be ma de much 
more based o n the quality of the ed u-
cation we c an deliver than the time we 
can deliver it in.”

and not necess arily affect classes. Ther e 
are other divisions that tend to add 
classes ove r addin g more admini stra-
tion, and those are the divisions that 
will have to cut classes.”
UCS D s pokesperson Ch ristine 
Clark said the total num ber of classes 
cut for Fall Quarter 2010 cannot yet be 
determin ed. 
“It is too soo n to tell how many  
classes w ill be c ut and wh at impa ct that 
will have fo r fall, since there are many 
changes that will happen between now 
and September,” Clar k said. 
An e-mai l sent  to all biology majors 
in mid-Mar ch said that some courses 
traditionally offe red multiple times 
throughout the year will only be taught 
once in 2010-11, while others will not 
be offe red at all. 
Bioengineering majors with a bio-
technology concentrati on were notified  
by e-mai l on May 6 that two required 
classes now have a time conflict, bec ause 
a separat e sec tion had been  cancelled . 
For students to stay on track within the 
concentrati on, according to the e-mai l, 
they must now dev iate from the pre-scribed graduation track b y making 
course substituti ons or leaving more 
difficult courses fo r quarters to come.
Howeve r, according to Assoc iate 
Dean  of E ducation G abriele 
Weinhausen, the sh rinking var iety of 
biolog y classes w ill not affect gradu-
ation rates. 
“We are teaching all required co urs-
es, and we ar e offe ring multiple sec-
tions of a ll required co urses,” she s aid. 
“The ability of student s to make aca-
demic progress and to graduate in four 
years is not affected.” 
The b ioengineering departm ent is 
allowing student s to enr oll in a substi-
tution class —  o ne discontinu ed seve ral 
years ago — fo r Fall Quarter only.
“Everyone is buckling dow n to pre-
pare for what could happen,” Hall said. 
“The departm ents are bein g told to 
anticipate a 10-percent cut, but be pr e-
pared fo r a 20-percent cut.”
UCS D already saw major course 
reductions this year. A.S. Social 
Sciences Senator Irfan Ahmed cited 
a report released b y the Ac ademic 
Senate in January,  which detai led that 
course availability in 2009-10  had been reduced b y 3.7 percent — o r about 52 
classes — sin ce the year befo re. 
“The admini stratio n is look ing at 
a $20 million base reduction in bud-
get,” Ah med said. “Thi s could go t o 
another $35 million, dep ending on 
the eco nomy. And — co mbined wit h 
faculty retirement plans, pensions and 
bundle ser vices — it  could go up  to 
$80 million.”
Ahmed said he noticed an increas-
ing num ber of pr ofesso rs are giving one 
midterm per quarter instead of t wo, 
though he admitted there wa s no hard 
evidence to back his obser vations. 
“Befo re, classes wo uld have two 
midterms and one final,” he s aid. “Now 
what’s been happening is a one-mid-
term, o ne-final policy. You save money 
from payin g TAs an d from payin g 
grader s.” 
The decr ease in cl ass offe rings is 
coupled w ith an increasing stude nt-to-
faculty ratio at UCS D. In the past four 
years, the ratio rose from 29.39-t o-1 in 
2006 to 31.17-to-1 in 2010.

It’s the next step in the evol ution 
of cell- phone technology: a poten-
tially life- prolonging micr ochip, 
compati ble w ith any mobile phone, 
that alerts users to the presen ce of 
harmful che micals in the air around 
them. 
As part of a De partm ent of 
Homeland Security  project called 
“Cell-All ,” the ch ip is bein g devel-
oped by a UCS D research group 
led b y che mistry professo r Michael 
Sailor, in co njunction with optics 
compan y Rhevision Tech nology. 
Acco rding to DH S Dir ector Stephen 
Dennis, the program aims to turn  
an average cell p hone into a portable 
chemical-det ection dev ice. 
The chip  samp les the surround-
ing air for dangerous chemic al 
compounds such as carbon diox ide, 
formaldehyde and propane.
“We had a breakthrough about 
a year ago to make these [sen sors] 
specific to che micals,” S ai lor said. 
“Putting sen sors on people is pro-
tecting the public he alth.” 
Sailor said the technology wa s 
inspired by bee tle shells , whose iri-
descent  layers mimic the layers of 
silicon cove red in ligh t reflectors that 
make up the ch ips.
When airborne che mical mol-
ecules co me into contact with 
the ch ip, the molecules bind and 
interfere with the light reflectors. 
Certain  reflection patterns set off 
sensors that will then identi fy the 
compound.
Rhevision is supplying Sailor’s 
research team with an optical len s 
that monitors the nanosen sors in 
the ch ip. When a sensor goes off , the len s det ects which exac t sensor 
it was, so t he user will know wh ich 
parti cular chemical is present  in the 
surrounding air.  
“When the ch ip detects a com-
pound, the colo r changes to alert the 
user,” Sailor said. 
At first det ection, the ch ip will 
alert the ow ner to the presen ce and 
type of chemic al via text message or 
cellular call. DH S plans to build a 
centra lized em ergency monitoring 
facility which w ill receive air samp le 
analysis and loc ation data from 
each remote chip whe n dangerous 
chemicals are det ected. (For privacy 
reasons, users will be a ble to opt out 
of being tracked b y the facility.)
Dennis said he ho pes that up to 
80 prototypes of t he ch ip — which 
he predicted w ill cos t $1 e ach — w ill 
be develo ped by the end of 2011 to 
accommodate diffe rent models of 
cell phones .
Howeve r, the release plan is still 
in its early stages. In order to place 
the product on the public market, 
the ch ip must prove to be co nsis-
tently accurate, without triggering 
false alarms that the user migh t learn 
to ignore. So far,  to en sure that the 
sensor is reliable, the lab has con-
ducted se nsitivity tests by pumpin g 
gases over the ch ip and recording 
how of ten it responded to vari ous 
chemicals. Sailor said he thinks the 
chip is infallible.
“Our bigges t advanta ge with our 
sensor is it doesn ’t foul,” Sailor said.
The team is currently wo rking to 
impr ove the se nsitivity of the ch ip, as 
well as widen the range of air borne 
chemicals it can detect.

2010-11 academic year, on a campus-by-campus basis (including CSU Northridge and Cal State East Bay) several California State University campuses are about to shrink their population of super seniors still nursing their degrees. 
It’s a legitimate pressure, considering the schools 
are under heavy admissions cuts and need to free up some space for other CSU hopefuls. But the measure chips at one of the most admirable fundamentals of the American university: that students be given an extension of time to find themselves and make sure they end up living a life that capitalizes on their strengths. The new plan attempts to limit the number of  
students with 144 credits or more by forcing them to file for graduation. More distressingly, students will lose all state and federal financial aid if they go over 150 credit hours — meaning all of the 433,000 current CSU students with over 160 units would lose their aid. For many, that means dropping out.
One can only keep his fingers crossed that the 
CSU  plan doesn’t inspire a similar crackdown on the 
University of California campuses.
It’s also no mystery why many undergraduates are 
hesitant to leave behind the comforts of waking up after 2 p.m. and wearing sweats all day to brave the real world, especially when the job market is so hope-less. In 2007, 51 percent of college graduates were able to find a job within six months of graduation; in 2009 only 19.7 percent of graduates could do so. Despite fifth- and sixth-year seniors’ “slacker image, ” many are extending their college experience because they decide to pick up an additional major or minor, or decided to change their major late in the game.
In previous years, the CSU campuses received 
$11,075 per student from the state, but the California budget crisis has reduced funding to only $4,669 per student. In order to absorb its 20-percent  budget cut, 
the CSU system has already slashed enrollment by 40,000 students. 
It’s understandable that CSU administrators 
A Shove in the Wrong Direction
 By Margaret Y auContributing Writer
See CSU page 5
ILLUSTRATIONS BY SARAH  ARAKAKI /GUARDIANAfter this weekend, I have been shaken by a delayed realization on the condition 
of our generation. It is one which, I must confess, saddens me to state in such sweeping, unequivocal terms, but which nevertheless must be done: Despite all Lady Gaga- and Whole Foods-engendered delusions of worldly grandeur, we are not a sophisticated kind. Not even a little.  
When, on May 1, No. 15 
Magazine — a new student publica-tion designed to “provoke thought and spark inspiration through the multifaceted world of fashion” — hosted a party on campus for its first issue, it wasn’t intended as another student-org event replete with con-struction-paper banners and Costco pizza. On the contrary, this was to be a high-class soiree — the type with cocktail napkins, plastic wine flutes filled with Martinelli’s (the student-org Cristal substitute of choice) and vaguely bourgie hors d’ oeuvres like sushi and cupcakes. 
Held on the top floor of the 
Village transfer-housing tower — the next best thing to an on-campus penthouse — the event even claimed to boast an exclusive VIP list. All this, mind you, in the name of sophistication. (And — my bad — the multifaceted world of fashion.)
While I personally could not 
be torn from my frozen dinner to make it all the way to that distant 15th floor, I’ve gathered from sec-ondhand accounts and awkwardly incriminating photos (here’s to you, King Gupta), that what resulted wasn’t so much a grand gathering of fashionable sophisticates as a small congregation of American Apparel-clad freshmen, who had apparently pregamed with just enough Popov to make the night remotely fun.  
Of course, No. 15 Magazine isn’t 
the only guilty one. Just last night, in fact, I attended a high-class potluck named the “pretentious party. ” The night began with admirable inten-tions, as several of my friends and I left the house in our bow-tied best, complete with fragrant cheese plat-ters and no fewer than five flavors of champagne. We danced to obscure music produced well before we were born. The host even committed to a razor-thin detective mustache.  
By the time the clock struck 1 a.m., 
though, not only had my companion and I — doing our best “Gossip Girl” imitation — gotten lost on the bus; we had clogged the toilet, obtained stains on our sophisticated ensembles and been evicted from the hot tub by “the head” of the home owner’s association. Apparently, Mr. Bustamante could not relate to our thoroughly cosmopolitan desire to hop the pool fence and go swimming in our underwear.
At the end of the day, though, 
who can really blame us for our cheap attempts at sophistication? On a campus whose ritziest indulgence comes in the form of a lukewarm $8 plate of mac ‘n’ cheese from Zanzibar Cafe, it’s no wonder that some of us wish to pretend — if only with a three-minute waltz or $5 bottle of champagne — that the finer things 
are well within reach. 4W[\QV\PM

Dear Editor,
The divestment resolution that 
the A.S. Council has discussed in 
meetings for the past two weeks called for the University of California to liquidate its holdings of “any United States companies materially supporting or profiting from occupa-tion and human rights violations. ” It specifically mentioned Israel’s activi-ties in the West Bank and Gaza. The resolution made no specific mention of firms that deal with the dozens of countries whose human rights records are, by many accounts, far worse than those of Israel — includ-ing many of Israel’s sworn past and present enemies. 
Divestment resolutions wind 
up in the courts all the time. Such resolutions are often challenged, and sometimes struck down, on the grounds that conducting foreign policy is not the business of a state 
government’s investment fund, or 
that the state’s money is for purposes other than a political statement by a particular group seeking to impose its views on a diverse community and administration. A possible outcome of enacting the proposed resolution would be to force the UC system into a costly legal battle at a time of severe financial strain. 
The divestment resolution repre-
sented nothing more than a costly, one-sided demonstration that is prac-tically guaranteed not to bring about any worthwhile result. Furthermore, the proposed divestment resolution is counterproductive even to the goals of the bill’s vocal backers, Students for Justice in Palestine. 
No one should lose sight of the 
reality that the proposed UC divest-ment is not likely to change the behavior of any firm, government or other entity. All we would accomplish by selling off those equity holdings is a forfeit of our shareholder influ-ence, and a transfer of it — possibly at a deflated price. In other words, the UC system would lose any ability to influence the management of the firms in question, while at the same time, it would create a quick profit opportunity for some other party 
that is not caught up in our political 
debate. 
The main argument set forth by 
South Africa divestment proponents 
in the 1980s was that, through a broad-based divestment campaign, Western financiers could drain the capital resources of firms that con-ducted business in South Africa. Those firms would in turn pressure the South African government into 
ending apartheid so the capital sanc-
tions could be removed. 
Unless the UC divestment were 
somehow augmented with more seri-ous capital market sanctions from Washington (which won’t happen, as our foreign policymakers have a different attitude toward the Middle East conflict than the extremists behind this resolution), the financing abilities and business prospects of the firms in question won’t be affected. 
The SJP-backed resolution specifi-
cally targets firms that conduct busi-ness with Israel in relation to its self-defense. Selling our already issued GE stock, for example, is most unlikely to compel GE to ask the Israeli govern-ment to halt their businesses. 
The divestment resolution was 
an attempt at appropriation of uni-versity funds by a vocal subset of students intent on making a symbolic statement on a divisive, emotionally charged issue. That is not an appro-priate use of a public university’s resources — or its good name.

would want their laggers to just gradu-
ate already. 
But, if we zoom out, the CSU sys-
tem is making itself into a robotic boot camp, mechanizing the university  to 
the point of becoming a degree fac-tory — not a place that fosters creativ-ity and risky pursuits in the name of happiness. A liberal-arts pathway that stresses the final degree — not the work it takes to get there — is seri-ously overlooking the purpose of exist-ing in the first place as an alternative to more technical schools. 
Luckily, according to UCSD 
spokesperson Christine Clark, the new CSU policy won’t be adopted by UC campuses. Instead of kicking super seniors out, they are cutting enroll-ment of incoming freshmen in the UC system by 1,500 students every year. 
While this blow to accessibility 
should not be taken lightly, there’s a certain level of quality that must be maintained for those who are 
accepted. As tenured professors are swapped out for underpaid lecturers and TAs, and over-enrolled class offer-ings are slashed to only the necessities, it’s no wonder unsatisfied students are currently staying for an average of 4.3 years. UC administrators would be wise to prioritize the education of its current students before turning to the extreme CSU proposal, should it arise as a possible solution.
In the meantime, the CSU system 
could begin  with a lesser evil: prohibit-ing students to declare a second major or change their major by the time they’ve reached 130 credits. This policy would allow students ample time to find the right major, at the same time ensuring that students who are strug-gling because they just don’t want to grow up aren’t abusing a failing system.
Cutting off financial aid entirely 
to students who haven’t quite landed in their niche is a roundabout way to boot lower-income stragglers out of the system to make room for a new round of freshmen with plump college funds. Public education was designed to ensure that Californians be pro-vided the tools to get what they want out of life and make the world a better place — and sometimes, that can take more than four years.

On May 3, the U.S. Supreme Court brushed aside contestations over 
the long-disputed patch of land in Balboa Park leased to the Boy Scouts of America — with a hefty discount. Given that the park is public property, detractors argued, the constitutional ban on government preference for reli-gious groups prohibits the park from leasing its land to the organization at a reduced rate; to go against that ban is to compromise free speech. 
The crux of the Boy Scout contro-
versy is centered around the religious bias of the organization. However, even though the Boy Scouts histori-cally are a Christian organization, they claim to have no theology, nor a position for or against any particular religion. 
What’s more, a report drafted in 
2008 by the Balboa Park Committee states that the park may lease facilities to any “cultural institution” for “little or no rent” that will prove a benefit to the community — and it’s not only the Boy Scouts who benefit from this policy, which disproves any claims of religious preference. 
Y es, continuing to force scouts to 
recite their “duty to God” at meet-ings does reinforce a certain religious preference. And that probably won’t change in the immediate future. But it’s important to realize that almost every interest group is biased one way or the other — so the only way that the city government could remain unbiased is to provide land to the organizations who need it most — as all can agree a wilder-ness training program might.
 
—Cheryl Hori
Associate Opinion EditorIn 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that, because Boy Scouts of 
America is a private organization, it can legally discriminate based on sexual orientation. 
Boy Scouts has a long history of 
excluding atheists and agnostics as well. Two of the largest sponsors of the Boy Scouts are the Church of Latter Day Saints and the Catholic Church. Given these affiliations, it is clear that the organization has a religious agenda. And while the park committee’s 2008 report stipulates that discounted land may be granted to organizations that benefit the city, one that discriminates against many community members can hardly be considered beneficial. 
The city of San Diego has allowed 
Boy Scouts to lease city parklands for just $2,500 per year. By granting the Boy Scouts discounted rent, the city of San Diego is supporting what is clearly a discriminatory organization. Gays, lesbians, atheists and agnostics all pay taxes to the city to support those parklands. Allowing the Boy Scouts to use this land — practically for free — is an insult to San Diego 
residents.
As long as Boy 
Scouts of America 
remains an orga-
nization with a 
religious bias, 
it should not 
be supported by a 
government that is 
legally obligated to 
remain secular.

Closing in on the one-year mark, the Village at Torrey Pines
transfer housing is combing out the kinks, wrestling down rates and
gearing up for the next round of renters right around the bend.
According to HDH Director Mark Cunningham, after working with the 
student advisory committee, the department decided it would lower rent at the Village by spreading the debt racked up during its construction across all undergraduate housing. In other words, prices for all UCSD undergrads went up slightly so that the cost of living at the Village could go down about 9 percent. 
Lauren Klibingat, an Eleanor Roosevelt College first-year transfer cur-
rently living in Building 8, said she first moved to Village after spending 
some time as a commuter.

SUN GOD ISSUEI wanted to live on campus — which was a really 
smart move, ” Klibingat said. “I really recom-mend for transfer students to come here for one year and then move off campus. ”
A few weeks before school started, Klibingat 
said she noticed that transfer students planning to live in the Village were getting to know each other through Facebook. Eager to join their community, she signed a lease to live in a double room.
But when HDH couldn’t find Klibingat a 
roommate to share the double, they offered her the room for a price slightly higher than that of a single. Klibingat said she would never have been able to afford the room without the help of her parents.
“The room that I have is a double converted 
into a single, so its $1,450 [a month] — and I think a regular single that’s meant for one person is about $1,300, ” she said. “It’s not too much of a difference, but still. They said nothing else was available — that they were all full, and that was the only thing they had. ”
Klibingat, like the majority of her neighbors, 
is moving off-campus next year with friends she met at the Village, where she said she’ll be paying $600 a month, plus utilities.
Klibingat’s apartment at the Village isn’t 
unique: Many other residents are currently living in creative housing arrangements — some with missing roommates, and an even larger swath alongside non-transfer students allowed to live at the Village to fill the extra beds.
HDH began accepting non-transfer stu-
dents almost as soon as the Village opened its doors last Fall Quarter. According to Cunningham, it’s a common problem for new transfer-housing complexes: This coming aca-demic year, the take-rate for the Village is 38% percent of eligible transfer students, which is higher than most other complexes within the UC system. But because of this, the Village will most likely need to fill itself with junior and senior undergraduates again next year — something that, according to Cunningham, was indeed anticipated during the Village’s planning process. 
Despite generally luxurious accommodations, 
common complaints among Village students this year included the absence of a common lounge, window screens and parking spaces. Open windows brought in bugs and drafts, and without a common lounge, some students felt they had nowhere to congregate or plan large events. However — thanks, in part, to the stu-dent organization Villagers Initiating Progress, or VIP — Buildings Two through Eight were finally outfitted with screens last month. (As its windows weren’t designed for screens, Building One — the tower — will see them glued in this summer.) In addition, the unused bus stop in front of the Village marketplace was converted into a few 20-minute loading zones.
“In the beginning, we didn’t 
have such a programming focus, ” VIP co-director and ERC first-year transfer Robin Kim said. “We also worked with administrators to try a get a common lounge like the other colleges do — still haven’t gotten that figured out yet. ” 
It was around Week Three that 
Kim said he first noticed a poster asking students interested in student government to come to a meeting being held by the Village Resident Dean Terra Bailey and Assistant Resident Deans Susan Berry and Andrea Melrose. Shortly thereafter, the Office of Residence Life asked the group of interested students to create a council of sorts to represent the Village population. Elections were held, and Kim was elected director of internal affairs.
Kim himself happens to be quite the Village 
cheerleader: “It’s been pretty darn awesome, ” he said. He and the other nine consistent VIP mem-bers currently put most of their efforts toward planning events like the welcome-back dance and movie nights. However, when it first began, then-co-director and ERC first-year transfer Daniel Yuan said the council was more focused on improving problems within the complex.
“It’s not a bad organization, but I don’t think 
it’s realized its full potential, ” Yuan said. “It needs guidance from someone who knows about the bureaucracy. ”
Although he had only just transferred to 
UCSD, Yuan said he said he quickly noticed the obstacles preventing the Village from improving. Other colleges, he said, don’t want the Village to serve as housing for a seventh college, which is why it doesn’t have a legitimate college council or representation on the A.S. Council (although there is an A.S. transfer senator). Yuan said he would recommend a split between those inter-ested in putting on events and those focused on transfer-student and residential advocacy.
Yuan added that the sterile Village atmo-
sphere detracts from the area’s sense of commu-nity. Because students are not allowed to put up posters or fliers along railings or inside windows — as undergraduates often do in their dorms 
— Yuan said he believes Village administrators are priding van-ity over practicality. It’s a problem that A.S. Transfer Senator Powers encountered as well, when he first tried to reach out to his constituents living at the Village. 
“Y ou can’t flyer all over there 
like you can at any other colleges, ” Powers said. “They’re really proud of their new buildings, as they should be. So it took some time to figure out the right channels to go through. ”
The Village was recently 
equipped with a community board on which to put up fliers. However, according to Yuan, superficial restrictions like these are just the tip of the iceberg. Having worked with Village administrators during Fall 
and Winter Quarters, Yuan said he recognized that HDH has been working hard to fulfill stu-dent requests — but, he said, the department still has a long way to go. 
“I realize that things such as parking can be 
a long process, but that’s why you should finish phase one before you start on phase two, ” Yuan said, referring to the upcoming opening of the Village’s second half.  
The other half — a 10-story tower and four 
low-rise complexes, under construction across the street, and currently ahead of schedule — is set to open Fall Quarter 2011. The complex will include 800 more beds, along with a dining facil-ity and common lounge.
Revelle College first-year transfer Tim 
Richardson said he hasn’t been too pleased with the resounding noise of construction across the street.
“I had four roommates, and within the sec-
ond day, two of them moved out because of con-struction — because we’re right here in the tower facing the construction, ” Richardson said. “So as soon as the sun comes up, they’re out there. ”
Other residents have also struggled to adjust 
to the strict presence of security officers in the Village. Because many Villagers are over 21, and many others lived off-campus while attend-ing community colleges before transferring to UCSD, mandatory quiet hours and Residential Security Officers (RSOs) seem a suffocating price to pay for their on-campus locale.
“If you’ve lived off-campus before, you’ d 
know it wasn’t like this, ” said Sixth College first-year transfer James Pillow, who lives with Richardson on the 14th floor of Building One. “Y ou know how it is having a place, and you know what’s offensive to the people around you. Y ou know your neighbors, and you know which ones complain — and here, really, it’s not the neighbors who complain, but the RSOs doing their rounds. ”
According to Building One Community 
Coordinator and Revelle College third-year Marisa Llamas — an undergraduate non-transfer living in the Village — because transfer resi-dents are used to complete independence, they can find the crackdown on partying infringing. However, compared to her experience as a fresh-man in the Revelle dorms, Llamas said she finds Village regulations to be a breath of fresh air.
“I feel like there’s a little bit more of a sense of 
freedom over here, ” Llamas said. “When I was at Revelle, RSOs would walk though our suites — and here, they only walk through the hallways. Obviously parties still get broken up, but its still a more mature situation. ”
All residents interviewed said they planned 
to live off campus next year, mostly due to the high cost of rent. And yet, despite their criti-cisms, they all said they were glad they made the decision to live on campus. 
“I think that, here at UCSD, we don’t have 
that many new things — so it’s kind of odd for us to see something so new, ” Powers said. “Everything that’s been here has been here for 40 years, so considering all that, it’s done incredibly well. ”

Last Friday, inspired students from across 
campus came together for the Art in Action festival to demonstrate against discrimina-
tion and prejudice. The festival was organized by the UCSD theater department. Though it was largely in reaction to the “Compton Cookout” , according to a member of the vetting committee, Gabriel Lawrence, it functioned as an independent celebration of unique backgrounds, diversity and heritage. 
Surges of support came from all over campus 
— some professors even cancelled classes and offered extra credit.  Participating students got the word out through a variety of media, includ-ing signage in support of LGBT and civil rights, a live mural creation, spoken-word performances —    even a dance party all held at Mandell Weiss Theatre.  
Lawrence estimates that roughly 300 students 
were in attendance by the end of the evening. 
“One of my goals was to have conversations 
with people across campus about diversity,” Lawrence said. “Regardless of the numbers, to have meaningful conversations like that and know that people were inspired and had a change of heart — that makes the event a success.”

SALON BOHEME
SITESEEN
Though it may be cursed with a pretentious name, 
there’s nothing remotely ostentatious about Salon Boheme. Unlike other hair salons in Banker’s Hill, 
there’s no hipster soundtrack to the quiet din of faucets and clippers, no avant-garde magazines gracing the waiting-room table — just the idle chatter of Boheme founder Gregory Pearson and the latest headlines from Us Weekly and Marie Claire. 
Decorum takes a backseat to reasonably priced, qual-
ity hairstyling at Salon Boheme. It isn’t unheard of that Pearson — a notorious perfectionist — stay past 10 p.m. on a Friday night to ensure his last client leaves satisfied. That kind of dedication can have its downsides, though: It’s equally com-mon to wait up to 30 minutes into your appointment slot, so make sure you’ve got at least an hour to spare before stopping by. 
Because Boheme just opened its 
doors this February, the salon hasn’t yet developed a steady stream of foot traffic, so walk-ins are usually accommodated.
If you can forgive the delay, the salon’s atmosphere is far 
more relaxed than the local Supercuts. Seeing as it is a smaller operation, only four barber chairs are necessary — one or two of which are typically vacant.
Men’s haircuts go for $30 and women’s for $45 — a little on 
the pricier side. But you get what you pay for. Pearson’s com-mitment to haircutting — which, he says, grew from his desire for a creative outlet in college — shows in his precise cuts. He does, however, recognize that not every college student has the trust fund to bankroll a pricey trim, and is running a series of promotions to make his services more affordable. With a refer-ral, haircuts are currently half-off (tell him the Guardian sent you), and all hair-coloring appointments include a free cut. 
For those who don’t mind a 15-minute walk through down-
town, getting to the salon is a cinch on the UCSD Medical Center, Hillcrest shuttle, which runs Monday through Friday until about 9 p.m. For those less willing to trek the last leg of the trip from the shuttle stop, MTS Bus Route 3 can pick you up near the shuttle stop and drop you off just a block from the 
salon. Either way, Pearson can guarantee you’ll re-enter the La Jolla bubble a satis-fied, freshly shorn customer.

distance events. With the second-
to-last running event out of the way, the host Tritons trailed by less than nine points. All they needed was to win the 4x4 — collecting all 10 points awarded to the winner — and hope that Chico State would come in eighth place, giving them a single point.
The entire Chico and UCSD 
squads gathered along the side of the track to cheer on their relay teams. The Triton team was stacked with some of the conference’s top talent: Sophomore Jaqueline Rose would run the first leg, followed by juniors Kelly Fogarty and Stephanie LeFever, and anchored by senior Christine Merrill. Chico’s team was not as impressive: two freshmen, and a season-best time nearly 10 seconds slower than that of UCSD.
The noise from both crowds 
grew louder in the final moments before the gun went off, each try-ing to outdo the other in volume. Finally, the starting official’s voice came through the loudspeaker:
“Runners, to your marks. ”The chants grew even louder as 
the runners took their final stretches and lowered themselves into the blocks.
“Set. ”Silence. The stadium held its 
breath as the starter raised the gun above his head.
Crack.The runners exploded off the 
blocks with the sound of the gun, and the cheers re-emerged, loud as ever. Cal State Los Angeles jumped out to an early lead, but UCSD’s Rose kept it close, coming in just behind Cal State Los Angeles’ Brittany Manuel. Rose handed the baton to Fogarty, who was unable to close the gap for the first 200 meters of her leg of the race.
Fogarty had already won three 
conference championships on Saturday: she took both the 100- and 200-meter races, and ran on the victorious 4x100-meter relay team. While her achievements were undeniably impressive, questions began to crop up in the minds of the Triton squad. Does she have enough fuel left in the tank? She doesn’t normally run the 400 — can she run that far? Is this the end?
With about 150 meters left in her 
leg of the race, Fogarty answered those questions decisively. She suddenly exploded as if shot from a cannon, passing Cal State Los Angeles’ Moriah Jobrey like she was standing still and handing the baton to LeFever with the lead. 
“I couldn’t get her on the inside 
of the track so I had to go around her, ” Fogarty said. “ At that point, I knew that if I went around her, I was going to have to kick it into gear. ” 
The Golden Eagles, however, 
would not give up so easily. LeFever lost the lead in the handoff and battled for the top spot throughout her 400-meter stretch. As a heptath-lete, she was in her 12th event over a three-day stretch — an astounding feat. Nonetheless, LeFever showed both her versatility and endurance by handing the baton to Merrill only a step behind Cal State Los Angeles. 
Merrill ran behind the Golden 
Eagles’ Jennifer Shoate for the first half of her leg, once again raising questions about the Tritons’ chances.
Similar to Fogarty, Merrill had 
already won four events that day, including a victory in the 400-meter race, where she recorded the second fastest time in school history. She was without doubt the best choice for the anchor leg, but how much did she have left in her?
Once again, all questions were 
answered. Merrill passed Shoate with just under 200 meters left in the race and never looked back. UCSD finished with a time of 3:45.27, a three-second improve-ment on its season best. Cal State Los Angeles finished three seconds back at 3:48.21.
When the race was over, how-
ever, the Tritons were not the ones celebrating. Chico’s relay team fin-ished eight seconds back at 3:53.27 — almost an afterthought in such an exciting race — but it was good for fifth place, and four points in the overall standings.
Chico had won the CCAA 
women’s championship, ending UCSD’s bid for a sixth consecutive title. Y et the Triton relay team still stood triumphantly at the podium, receiving a loud ovation from their teammates, who had gathered at the edge of the track. 
The Tritons may have just missed 
the cut, but they certainly made it exciting.

But Loyola Marymount’s offense did not let up, matching UCSD’s four goals to nurse an 11-7 lead heading into the final quarter.
The Tritons outscored the Lions 
3-2 in the final period, but the early deficit was too much to overcome, and Loyola Marymount finished with a 
13-10 victory.
With their seasons on the line, the 
two teams engaged in an aggressive face-off, combining for 21 exclusions and three five-meter penalty shots. 
Bloom led the Tritons with four 
scores in the first three quarters, and Crowell scored another three. Lions junior driver Mary Ann Campos led the opposing team with four goals. 
Following their second straight 
conference title — their eighth in the past 10 seasons — the Lions advanced to the NCAA Championships, and will face off against No. 4 UCLA on May 14. The Tritons brought their final overall record for the season to 18-19.
As the No. 2 seed in the tourna-
ment, the Tritons were pitted against seventh-seeded Sonoma State on April 30. UCSD quickly fell behind 3-1 in the first quarter, but stormed back with five goals in the second period, out-scoring the Seawolves 5-1. Crowell and junior utility Coles both scored goals in the last two minutes of the half, giv-ing the Tritons a 6-4 lead.
UCSD maintained control in the 
second half, scoring the first three goals after the break and taking a 9-4 advantage late in the third. The Tritons held on in the last quarter for the 10-7 win that advanced them to the semifinal game against Colorado State University. 
In the semifinal, the Tritons put 
up five spots on the scoreboard in the second and fourth quarters. Senior goalkeeper Markayla Quane set the UCSD single-season saves record, pro-pelling the team to its first WWPA Championship game in six seasons. 
Heinrich said that despite UCSD’s 
struggles earlier this year, the program is in a strong place going forward.
“This year has been a huge step 
for this program, ” Heinrich said. “We had a new coaching staff and nobody expected us to do as well as we did, but we knew where we wanted to be. We went from being fourth in conference and not ranked to ranked in top 20 and runner up in conference. It’s a good place for the program to be. ”

 AROUND THE LEAGUE
London-based club team Chelsea FC 
won the English Premier League on May 9 — the final matchday of the season — by demolishing Wigan Athletic 8-0. The Blues finished with 86 points, one more than arch-rival Manchester United.KIRBY ST. JOHN | BASEBALL
TRACK & FIELD  — UCSD’s track-and-field 
stars walked onto their home field May 6 ready to sweep the 2010 California Collegiate Athletic Association Championships. Turns out, so did Chico State.
The Triton squad came in second place 
on both the men’s and women’s sides at the conference championships last week. UCSD hosted the meet and won 15 events, but it was Chico who came out on top by definitively sweeping both divisions.
The Triton women came up just short in 
their bid for a sixth consecutive conference title, losing it by less than three points: UCSD ended with 209.5 points, second only to Chico’s total of 212.33. Cal State Los Angeles finished third with 101.33 points, while San Francisco State finished fourth.
The fate of the women’s title came down 
to a thrilling 4x400 relay — the final event of the meet — but the Tritons were unable to prevent Chico’s conference win.
“To get at that many conference champi-
ons and not win the meet is incredible, ” wom-en’s coach Darcy Ahner said. “It’s a tough one to swallow, but I’m so proud of how the team competed, it’s hard to be sad about it. ”
The women had 12 event wins at the 
meet. Senior Christine Merrill was named Athlete of the Meet for the second straight year, after winning a total of five events throughout the day: the 100- and 400-meter hurdles, the 400-meter race and the 4x100 and 4x400 relay teams. Her time of 54.76 seconds in the 400-meter is the best in school history.
Junior Kelly Fogarty joined Merrill on 
both relay teams, and individually won both the 100- and 200-meter dashes. Y et nei-ther could compete with the versatile junior Stephanie LeFever, who competed in no less than 12 events over the three-day meet. LeFever won the heptathlon and long jump on Friday, then won the triple jump and saw victory as part of the 4x400 relay team on Saturday. 
Fogarty’s 200-meter time of 23.97 seconds 
improved on her own school record; It was also the first time she had broken the 24-sec-ond mark.
“I’ve been working very hard to get down 
to the 23s, ” Fogarty said. “So it was very nice to actually do it. ” 
Senior Linda Rainwater battled injury to 
win the high jump with a mark of 5’7.25” — making her the reigning national champion in the event. 
However despite star efforts of the Triton 
athletes, Chico’s deep, solid roster proved too much to overcome, as team members were 
often able to pick up points even if they did not win the event.
“We didn’t have as much depth going 
into this meet as we’ve had in years past,” Ahner said. “We put together a phenomenal meet, but we just did not have the depth.”
On the men’s side, Chico quickly ran away 
with the meet, totaling 290.5 points to earn its seventh straight CCAA title. The Triton men finished with 140 points, just ahead of Cal Poly Pomona’s 130. 
Senior Leon Baham was the star of the 
day, winning both the 110- and 400-meter hurdles. 
“What can I say? The guy just lines up 
and races, ” men’s coach Tony Salerno said. “It’s really a warrior mentality needed for the hurdle events, and he’s got that. ”
Sophomore Nick Howe picked up his sec-
ond consecutive conference title in the javelin throw: His mark of 208’6” bested his closest competitor by over 15 feet. 
The Tritons will compete in the Cal State 
Los Angeles Last Chance Qualifier Meet on May 15, and will travel to the national Division-II Championships two weeks later in Charlotte, NC.

WOMEN’S WATER POLO —  Facing off against the Lions 
in a highly anticipated conference championship matchup, 
the No. 18 Tritons fell to No. 8 Loyola Marymount University 13-10 on May 2, officially ending their 2010 campaign.
UCSD advanced to the Western Water Polo Association 
conference final after defeating Sonoma State University and Colorado State University at the conference tournament in Bakersfield from April 30 to May 2. 
“From the beginning of the season, our goal was to get to 
the championship game, ” senior captain Stephanie Heinrich said. “Obviously we wanted to win too, but we had to put in all the hard work just to get there. ”
The Lions and the Tritons last battled on Feb. 20 — a 
game that Loyola Marymount dominated, winning 10-4 against the then unranked UCSD women. Now boasting a perfect WWPA record, the Lions entered 
the final game as the favorite after defeating Cal State San 
Bernardino and Cal State Bakersfield. 
UCSD scored first, sending the Lions into their first defi-
cit of the tournament. However, Loyola Marymount  quickly 
turned around, netting three scores within one period to 
finish the quarter with a 3-2 advantage.
The second quarter proved to be treacherous for the 
Tritons. Unable to contain a persistent offensive attack from the Lions, UCSD was outscored 4-1 in the period — and Loyola Marymount had taken a commanding 7-3 lead by 
halftime. 
Led by two goals from senior attacker Audra Bloom, the 
Tritons swarmed back into the game in the third quarter, using scores from sophomore attacker Jessica Tran and junior attacker Hanalei Crowell to outdo their first-half total. LOYOLA MARYMOUNT ENDS TRITON SEASON IN TITLE GAME
