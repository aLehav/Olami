Campus police and administrators 
at UC Santa Cruz are taking greater 
measures this year to dissuade thou-sands of students and marijuana enthusiasts from congregating on 
campus for the annual April 20 mari-juana festival.
Participation in the 2009 festi-
val will be discouraged with barri-cades, stringent parking enforcement, restricted shuttle access and a ban on overnight guests in university housing 
from April 17 to April 20.
Thousands of students and com-munity members gather every year in 
Porter Meadow to smoke and ingest cannabis, filling the sky with a haze of smoke. 
Though the tradition began 20 
years ago, UCSC spokesman Jim Burns — who has worked there for 24 years — said the event has attracted an unmanageable number of participants within the last several years.
Officials first attempted to 
crack down last year, after receiv-ing increased public attention that stemmed partly from the publication of an article in Rolling Stone magazine about the university’s reputation as a 
stoner campus.“Obviously, this isn’t something 
that the university wants to be associat-
ed with, ” Santa Cruz City Councilman Mike Rotkin said. “The university took similar precautions for the first time last year, but it didn’t seem to curb the number of students and com-munity members from attending. ”
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Fellicia McGinty recently sent an e-mail to students and parents of fresh-men labeling the event unsanctioned and unwelcome, calling it an “illegal activity that diminishes UCSC’s repu-tation and draws negative attention to

Just two weeks after the UC Board 
of Regents awarded salary increases to several top executives, UC President Mark G. Yudof introduced a plan last week that would reduce UC employee salaries and implement furloughs in an effort to combat the state budget crisis. The plan will be presented at the regents’ May meeting at UCSD.
“My goal is to produce for con-
sideration by the regents,  in May, a 
flexible regental standing order that would serve as a broad legal frame-work to allow for both systemwide and campus-by-campus furloughs and salary reductions, should deteriorating financial conditions so require, ” Yudof said in a statement last week.

About 10 percent of the $20.7 mil-
lion in UCSD’s annual registration-fee funds — which have historically supported student services — will help fill gaps from state-funding reductions for the 2009-10 academic year. Administrators say the cuts will most likely  threaten student services in the form of programming, events and staffing levels. 
The campuswide deficit next 
year is expected to range from $450 million to $700 million, $115 mil-lion of which stem from state fund-ing cuts. In response, the Student Affairs Office, which oversees the funds, has charged the 17 members on the  Registration Fee Advisory Committee with prioritizing each of 26 registration fee-funded units — including the Student Health Center, Career Services Center, university centers and campus recreation — to ensure the least amount of damage to programming. The committee is still debating 
whether to make an across-the-board cut or investigate which specific stu-dent services could afford greater funding slashes. 
Funding accrued from the cut 
will then be converted to general funds, about 70 percent of which goes toward academic affairs such as admissions and maintaining the availability of classes, salary and inflation adjustments, previous over-enrollment and staffing. 
Committee chair and graduate 
student Garo Bournoutian said reg-istration-fee funds need to be sepa-rated from budget cuts in order to maintain the availability of student services. 
“Students are paying [money] 
specifically for these services, and they’re independent of the state, ” Bournoutian said. “Y ou’re still paying the same amount, so you should be getting the same services. It doesn’t make sense that because the state’s losing money, the reg fee gets cut to make up for it. ”
Bournoutian said that in the 
1970s, the regents separated the cur-rent $288 registration fee from the $2,087 education fee to protect stu-dent services from budget reductions, 
Budget constraints force 
administrators to seek out internal funding from student affairs office.

UCSD’s student-run cooperatives 
are free of their debt to the A.S. coun-
cil today after councilmembers voted last night to pay off over $35,000 in back rent accrued by the Food Co-op, the General Store Co-op, Groundwork Books and the Che Cafe during their 2004 space-agreement negotiations.
The council voted unanimously 
to absorb the $35,408.37 sum after an impassioned presentation by co-op employees and supporters. 
The council will allocate $12,426.06 
to the Food Co-op, $12,392.00 to the General Store Co-op, $7,083.88 to Groundwork Books and $3,506.43 to the Che Cafe. This sum will be taken from the council’s mandate reserves, a fund that Revelle College Senator Katie Hall described as a general account set aside for emergencies. 
Food Co-op core member Daniel 
Nguyen gave a presentation at the meeting outlining the history of the four co-ops’ debt and the reasons 
it should be forgiven. According to 
Nguyen, the master space agreement — a contract enacted in 1993 that resembled a landlord-tenant agree-ment between the university and the co-ops — ended in 2000, leaving the co-ops without an official contract. 
According to Hall, the council 
did not renew this contract when it expired  in 2000, although it was an A.S. responsibility. Following this, the university sent the co-ops an eviction notice in 2004. 
“We didn’t think about it until 
2004, [at which time] the co-ops decided to renegotiate the contracts [because] they weren’t happy with the old one, ” Hall said. 
The negotiation period that fol-
lowed lasted for two years, during which no official contract existed between the university and the co-ops. Also during this time, Student Center construction interfered with co-op functionality, in turn causing greater disagreements about rent. 
According to Nguyen, the co-ops 
stopped paying rent to the university at this time because they did not agree upon a contract and because the con-struction obstructed co-op entrances 
and blocked off the Food Co-op’s

case before receptive councilmembers.

kitchen, dramatically hindering the 
co-ops’ livelihood. 
“Until this, co-ops were very con-
sistent [in paying their rent], ” Nguyen said. “It’s not because of being finan-cially irresponsible, but because our existence at this point was being threatened. ”According to Nguyen, a new mas-
ter space agreement was decided upon 
in June 2006, and the co-ops were sent a $35,408.37 bill for expenses accrued during the lengthy negotiations. 
“Since 2006, they’ve paid off a 
significant portion of the debt, ” Hall said. “They’ve been paying off debt for years when they could be expand-ing to offer new services. We decided to forgive the debt. We really sup-port the co-ops. It’s one of the only completely student-owned assets on campus and a great way for people to get involved. ” 
Readers can contact Yelena Akopian at 
yakopyan@ucsd.edu. The council was remarkably adept at moving through the numerous items on the agen-
da at last night’s meeting, without the usual heavy and circular discussion.
The minutes from the first week 
were revised to excuse All-Campus Senator David Ritcherson’s absence, 
on the account of an e-mail commu-nication error. 
Transportation and Parking 
Services Director Brian 
D’ Autremont ’s presentation on his 
office’s workings was eclipsed by the 30 or so members of the public who joined the coun-cilmembers at the Price Center East Forum to speak in favor of reliev-ing the debt of the UCSD co-ops. 
“Not only have we’ve sacrificed 
the needs of our workers but we’ve also ignored the needs of our custom-ers, ” Physical Sciences Senator Daniel 
Nguyen  said. 
With a decisive 25 votes in favor, 
and one abstention, the council wrote off the debt. Members of the public cheered and literally jumped for joy at the news. 
Vice President of External Affairs 
Lisa Chen  discussed the D.R.E.A.M. 
Act in relation to the UC system, which was followed with a timely yet brief discussion of alcohol policies and ways to thwart crafty undercover police come Sun God 2009. 
Associate Vice President of Athletic 
Affairs Peter Benesch wondered aloud 
whether it is a good idea to run away if approached with the unattractive possibility of being charged with an alcohol-related crime. 
“Fleeing is never a good idea, ” 
Associate Vice President of Student Advocacy Frank Carroll  replied deci-sively, before informing everyone in the room of their right to refuse to submit to a search.
Advocate General Chris Rebert 
motioned to postpone indefinitely the impeachments of Ritcherson and Social Sciences Senator Nicole Carroll , 
which were approved with surprisingly little discourse. Both senators were in attendance at the meeting. 
Since the issue of the changes to the 
funding process for student organiza-tions was split last week, the creation of the Student Organization Funding 
Advisory Board was addressed in Unfinished Business.  
Sixth College 
Senator  John 
Cressey explained 
that he did not rel-
ish the idea of creating a new commit-tee of appointees when the senators are more than capable of undertaking the funding responsibilities. 
“I feel like its really hard and 
kind of unrealistic to expect any-one from any student org to under-stand this funding process to such a degree, ” Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs Lana Blank  said. 
“I don’t think it’s responsible to do this now with a new council com-ing in. We’re basically writing a new system and saying now you have to deal with it. ”
A Finance Restructuring 
Committee was created with the aim of reorganizing the finance committee so that it could meet the stipulations of the new system of allocating A.S. funds; the committee would dissolve next Wednesday. 
President Donna  Bean  gave the 
council props for its time-conscious consensus to dissolve the co-op debt, calling it the “most efficient decision this council has made. ”+W]VKQT*aXI[[M[1UXMIKPUMV\[

since these services are typically the first to be cut. 
The university’s protocol for 
dealing with state budget cuts, how-ever,   is to subtract from its three funding sources — general state funds, education fees and registra-tion fees — to limit the impact on any one source.
“Our campus looks at all three 
funding sources as one pool of funds, ” Bournoutian said. “It’s hard [to pro-tect student services from these cuts] because everything is an advisory to [Chancellor Marye Anne Fox]. But the key is to get students to see what the impact is and convey that to the chancellor. ”
Bournoutian said student input 
— through the 11 student represen-tatives on the committee — is crucial to funding prioritization, in order to ensure the least damage to programs and events students value the most.
“ At least the ones that are at the 
lower tier, that — if push comes to shove and we need to lose it for a cou-ple years — it won’t be catastrophic, ” he said. “It won’t be something that students depend on day to day. ” 
The committee’s report will be 
finalized in the next two or three weeks, and will include recommen-dations under three scenarios: 5 per-cent, 10 percent and 15 percent cuts. The severity of the cuts, which would occur in July, will be determined when the university receives its final-ized operating budget in the coming months.
“If the number is big, we might 
have to reorganize Student Affairs, ” Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Ed Spriggs said. “Make it more centralized, because right now 
there’s not a lot of bureaucracy. It’s 
not vertical and very spread out. ”
Spriggs cited the overlapping 
Administrative Services and Student Affairs departments in each of the campus’ six colleges as a possible area of consolidation. 
He said there have already been 
hiring freezes and caps on executive salaries. 
“The major budget reduction is hitting all areas of campus, and the reg fees are a part of it, ” Spriggs said. “We have to put the perspective of cutting from one department against all other priorities. ” 
The looming 10 percent reduction 
from registration-fee funds would follow a 5 percent cut to the Student Affairs Office from last December.
“The department was able to 
absorb [the 5 percent cut], but we lost wiggle room and flexibility for future reductions, ” Spriggs said.
He added that the department 
“never really recovered” from shaving $5 million off its 2003-04 budget.
“There’s no area where we’ve got 
any fat, ” he said.
The Campus Budget Office will 
ultimately decide the allocation of funds from registration fee cuts after the university’s operational budget is finalized, likely focusing on main-taining the university’s academic function.
“No decisions have been made 
yet, but we’re trying to determine how to best manage expected state-bud-get reductions to mitigate our core instructional mission, ” said Sylvia Lepe-Askari, assistant vice chancel-lor of the campus budget office. “The campus has to fund state reductions with general funds. ”

As the increasingly unpopular 
UC Board of Regents prepares to meet next month right here 
at UCSD, there will be plenty of items to consider — specifically, all things related to money, because the uni-versity, frankly, doesn’t ever seem to have enough, except to fill the already bloated pockets of its administrators.
Faced with dwindling state sup-
port and rising operating costs, the regents look certain to raise student fees by nearly 10 percent next year in an effort to maintain services.But student fees aside, regents will 
also be considering a plan developed by UC President Mark G. Yudof outlining unpaid leave-of-absence procedures for employees systemwide. Meant to serve as a legal framework allowing cam-puses to determine their own furlough protocols, the plan in effect will just end up screwing over another vulnerable group: UC workers. 
After allegedly freezing the sala-
ries of 300 top executives earlier this year and enacting a hiring freeze (measures the university itself has already broken by hiring two new executives and offering a hefty pre-emptive retention pay increase to another exec), administrators are now counting on workers to bear the brunt of its funding shortage. In effect, Yudof is leaving the door wide open for employees to be sent home on unpaid leaves in an effort to conserve cash — employees who barely make ends meet now and who remain underpaid (if we speak in terms of market competitiveness, jar-gon the university loves throwing around) despite recent contractual agreements to the contrary.
The answer to the university’s 
funding shortage should not be to shove this expense onto the backs of workers and students. The only way to solve this problem is with policies that target the university’s administrative salaries. If the regents were serious about its commitment to serving these groups, they would end executive pay hikes, not raise student fees and impose mandatory worker furloughs. Hey A.S. Council, good job!
At last night’s meeting, 
councilmembers voted to 
overwhelmingly approve a $35,408.37 allocation to UCSD’s four student-run co-ops. The funding — which was taken from the council’s mandate reserves — will cover co-op debt owed to the council, accrued years ago during their controversial master space agreement negotiations with the university. This much-needed support comes from a council that has remained largely uninvolved in the co-ops’ treacherous dealings with the university. 
The Che Cafe, Groundwork 
Books, the General Store Co-op and the Food Co-op are student-run non-profits, providing an array of valuable resources to students. As part of their self-sustaining, campus-improve-ment mission, the co-ops value lower prices over profit and funnel any revenue back into the Student Center community by hosting events and improving their in-shop lounge spac-es for students. Because of this ideol-ogy, making up a years-old $35,000 debt (the validity of which is pretty nebulous) would pose a devastating and unrealistic burden.  
Absorbing this debt by dipping 
into mandate reserves is a pragmat-ic solution to the unfair position in which current co-oppers have been placed, and councilmembers should be applauded for their reasonable and swift action. By not using money from the student organizations unallocat-ed fund, as was originally proposed, councilmembers shielded the rest of the student body from any impact this might have had on student org funding. Instead, the council exhibited sophisticated discretion, choosing to redirect money from its reserves to finally put this mess to rest.
The co-ops are an excellent 
resource — and not just for the Student Center community and the hundreds of undergraduates, grad students, staff and faculty who visit them daily. Sure, Groundwork’s cheap books, the Food Co-op’s cheap and healthy lunch options, the General Store’s awesome lounge (complete with old-school arcade games) and the Che’s all-age concerts are awe-some, but you don’t have to visit the co-ops to benefit from their presence here at UCSD. As completely student-run entities, the co-ops provide an essential contrast to Price Center’s corporate aura, while advocating for student rights and providing a free-spirited, progressive-minded campus niche for students. 
But it wasn’t just this edito-
rial board that took notice of the council’s resourcefulness: “That was probably the most efficient deci-sion we’ve made all year, ” outgoing A.S. President Donna Bean said as she thanked the council for coming together to address this issue.
Councilmembers deserve praise 
for the careful but prompt way they handled this request, and we’re ecstatic to see both effective gover-nance and respect and support for these crucial campus entities.

By Trevor Cox
Associate Opinion Editor 
STUDENT LIFE — Living on cam-pus at UCSD means being held to legalistic policies in need of revi-
sion, as implemented by residence 
life offices that are sorely out of touch with the student body. Residence life offices must address this by working harder to publicize students’ rights when it comes to substance abuse violations.
Given the fact that UCSD is a 
public institution that’s responsi-ble for enforcing California state 
law, it shouldn’t come as a surprise 
that alcohol consumption by those under 21 years of age is frowned upon — in fact, the clause outlining the prohibition of alcohol in univer-sity housing is one of the garbled code’s clearest statements. 
Resident deans from five of the 
six colleges (Warren Resident Dean Claire Palmer was unavailable for comment) said they believe the current nonacademic misconduct process (the write-up process) to be more educational than puni-tive. But based on the most recent Undergraduate Student Experience and Satisfaction committee report (published in September 2005 to outline everything students think is wrong with the university) and cur-rent collective student sentiment, that’s really not the case. 
The U.S.E.S. report highlights 
students’ issues with residential security officers — they inspire fear in students and their duty should 
be to assure safety, not to police 
dorms. Resident deans from John Muir, Eleanor Roosevelt, Roger Revelle and Sixth Colleges agree with the latter sentiment — but they also don’t see any issues with the way RSOs currently do their jobs, despite the plain evidence that students do.
Each of the resident deans also said their offices ensure that stu-dents know how they can respond to write-ups. While Revelle College Resident Dean Malik Ishmael went so far as to say he doesn’t know what more the university could pos-sibly do to inform students of their rights, Pat Danylyshyn-Adams, resi-dent dean of Muir College, said she feels students probably aren’t aware of certain steps they can take in their own defense — such as filing complaints against RSOs. She also 
said the administration needs to 
evaluate its outreach and clarity for students’ sake.
Frank Carroll, A.S. associate vice 
president of student advocacy, for one, is doing his part to reach out to students. His office is beginning a Know Y our Rights campaign regard-ing substance abuse and RSOs lead-ing up to the Sun God Festival, 
though Carroll said future cam-
paigns, perhaps during Welcome Week, will focus more on residence life. He said one of the chief con-cerns of his office involves RSOs’ violation of the Fourth Amendment (for the less legalistically inclined, the fundamental American right preventing unlawful searches and seizures). Students aren’t obligated to allow RSOs entry into their living area, but currently RSOs have the power to forcibly enter any living area under the guise of a “health and safety check. ”
If residence life offices really 
were doing their very best job of informing students, these efforts would be superfluous.
When a student is found in pos-
session of, say, a “party ball” (the conduct code doesn’t explicitly state what exactly one of these is, but 
from context we can deduce that it’s 
some kind of container with a lot of 
alcohol), seldom is he aware of what kinds of repercussions will follow. The write-up process he faces can by turns be confusing, intimidating or painstakingly slow. 
The residence life offices don’t 
contact the student with any infor-mation during the weeks that pass 
between the write-up and the next 
step — an e-mail parcel notification, 4QOP\MVAW]Z

Look, I love books. Absolutely 
love ’ em all. As a sophomore, I rejected all hope of future pros-
perity by trading in my human biology major for literatures in English. And, as the zeitgeist would have it, I’ll be doing that reading not on pages, but on an electronic screen. 
But don’t start lamenting the end 
of civilization, or the inevitable world electronics industry domination just yet. Revolutionary technologies have already changed the way we listen to music, communicate and access information. Come on, our parents were sure the freaking Internet was going to phase out all human com-munication until they started using Urbandictionary.com to figure out what the hell we were talking about. It’s not so surprising that some techies have decided it’s time we stopped cutting down trees in the interest of looking cool while reading “War and Peace” on the shuttle. 
Remember when portable mp3 
players first showed up? Everyone thought the music industry was crazy to believe we would pay for, or even to need access, thousands of songs at any given moment. A few years and billions of iTunes downloads later, having your music collection at your fingertips has become the norm, not the exception. 
Now I, more than most people, 
understand that the pleasure of curl-ing up with a page-turner could never (or at least not soon) be duplicated by an electronic screen. It doesn’t have that musty book smell; you won’t remember the time you picked it out at Pennywise Books with your literary-minded ex; you won’t be able to mail it to your sister once you finish it. 
But, as college students, let’s be 
honest: The allure of paying under $5 for Dostoevsky’s complete works, as I did last night for a Russian literature class using Amazon’s e-reader Kindle, is nearly irresistible. If I really love all 600-odd pages of “The Idiot” and want it physically sitting on my bookshelf, I can overnight it. No big deal.
This isn’t the beginning of a devalu-
ation of the book — quite the opposite, in fact. I’ll feel much better dropping a couple hundred bucks on a rare or signed edition of a novel, because I’ll have extra cash available that I won’t have spent on paperbacks in the air-port. The latest John Grisham thriller provides me with nothing more than an entertaining way to pass the time on the Amtrak to Los Angeles. On the other hand, a first-edition Jack Kerouac will, in my estimation, be worth holding on to — and I’m talking physically.
I’m not saying the Kindle is the 
be-all end-all of books as we know it. I’m just saying that something like it is going to be in everyone’s pocket on the subway in the not-too-distant future. Not only are e-readers portable, efficient and convenient, they also fit perfectly into the “green” mentality of the moment, which everyone from President Barack Obama to Chancellor Marye Anne Fox is currently adopting

Killing fewer trees definitely 
gets filed under “sustainability. ” In 
fact, they might even build a mon-ument to the Kindle at our new Sustainability Center. 
And at a time when newspa-
pers and publishing companies are either collapsing like condemned buildings or cutting staff like it’s the apocalypse, Kindle and the like can achieve the impossible: increase both access to written works and American reading levels. 
Digression: We, as a culture, are 
lazy. If you want to debate this, we can talk about it in the car at the nearest drive-thru restaurant, as long as we stop at the B-of-A ATM on our way. And after our conversa-tion, I’m sure we’ll both need a drink or two, which we can pick up at the drive-thru liquor store. 
But I get it — you’ d rather not go to 
the library and hear 5-year-olds whin-ing about borrowing the latest Disney installment. Plus, the Fashion Valley Barnes & Noble  employees are creepy, 
and don’t even get me started on Geisel Library. I feel for you. 
But get this: Kindle loads reading 
material, ranging from classic novels to newspapers,   in seconds. To you. At your exact location. To a flat device the (exact) size of an unopened DVD case that weighs only around twice as much as a double-double burger, even animal-style.
Unfortunately, like most new tech-
nologies, e-readers currently come with a hefty price tag. Not only will the Kindle set you back a few hundred, but new releases often clock in at around $10. Considering that you’re paying for a digital copy that can’t even be trans-ferred, much less resold after you read it, that seems a little steep.

But before the individual report 
is delivered to Johnny, he knows nothing of the kinds of charges he stands to face, or the consequences of those charges. 
In fact, once the report is deliv-
ered, accompa-nied by a brochure called “Essential Information  Pertaining to an Allegation of Non-Academic  Misconduct, ”  Johnny’s only made aware of a list of possible outcomes of his alleged miscon-duct, ranging from a warning to sus-pension; but there’s no specification whatsoever of which outcome might fit his crime.
In order for the write-up pro-
cess to actually be educational in practice, residence life offices must do just that: educate. Freshmen are likely to be confused by the legalistic language of the Student Conduct Code; resident deans should post clear, user-friendly descriptions of the write-up process in individual freshman suites each year; that way, there would be a clear, omnipresent reminder of what exactly students can expect if they’re unfortunate enough to be written up. Residence life offices could also instruct the RAs to hold quarterly suite meetings explaining this very process, and the rights that students have throughout each of its stages. Students must be made aware that 
they’re not required to allow RSOs access to their room or suite, and that the best move is typically to step outside with an RSO to civilly discuss whatever the issue appears to be.
Realistically, when an RSO 
announces his presence, students are going to be intimidated — which is why it’s so important that they know how the process works before that knock on the door even occurs. 
Other, even small-er steps, such as composing a stan-dard e-mail to send to accused stu-dents rather than a preposterous parcel notification, would increase the transparency of the write-up process. Small steps like these to optimize transparency could go a long way in 
improving student attitudes toward this disciplinary — sorry, “educa-tional” — process. And being that the goal of the whole nonacademic misconduct process is education, it seems only fair for residence life offices to fully inform students.
An as-yet unnamed committee, 
under Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny Rue, will soon be entirely rewriting the Student Conduct Code to increase its clar-ity and accessibility over the next 18 months. 
But the efforts shouldn’t stop 
there — if this process is to become truly educational, residence life offices must do more to ensure that students know their rights.

Dear Editor,
As a proud graduate of UCSD 
(class of 2008), and a current M.Ed 
student at this school, I was not able to vote in the recent A.S. election, and I wanted a chance to be heard. I understand from my undergradu-ate roommates that there is a move-ment afoot to start an undergraduate football team at UCSD, with possible funding coming from the undergrad-uate pocketbook. I write to express my disapproval of such an idea at UCSD.
We have always been a rigorous 
academic school, with little time for such extravagant sports as football. We have very good sports teams (water polo, soccer) that make better use of our time and money than the money-sink that is a college football program. In addition, many UCSD students are quite proud of the reputation we have in the city and the state for being focused on the more important things in life. We look down on schools like San Diego State University for valuing sports and fraternities over academic rigor and action in the world. To add a football team to UCSD would cheapen our image and put unnecessary finan-cial strain on the undergraduates.
If, after demanding a hefty ath-
letics referendum two years ago, the athletics program has  extra money to 
spend, let it be put back into things that really matter at the school. Let us improve the sports that are already thriving and respected at UCSD. Let us make the campus more sustain-able, and offer better services to the students who are paying so much for them. Better yet, give the money back to the undergraduates, many of whom struggle through school work-ing two jobs to make ends meet in this economy. Make more scholarships for groups who are underrepresented in the UCSD student population. Put money back into the tutoring and outreach programs that have been cut over the last several years. 
In short, I urge you, the A.S. 
Council, and the whole school to find something better to do with our time, our money and our reputation than to throw it into expensive uniforms and stadiums. Thank you for your time and your effort in serving UCSD.
— Bonnie Wagner
Graduate Student
Dear Editor,
I’m writing to address a docu-
ment titled, “The UC Budget: Myths & Facts, ” recently posted on the UC 
Office of the President’s Web site.
Many of the misstatements in 
that document are things that I have pointed out before in my writing and speaking to top officials of this uni-versity, though my critiques have been ignored. Here are the worst examples:
The fact sheet said, “UC’s budget 
is made up of many different fund sources, but most of them are restrict-ed to specific uses and cannot be used for other purposes. ”
In the latest budget, one reads of 
$5.4 billion in “core funds, ” which are defined as general funds plus student fees. But we see that this accounts for only 39 percent of all unrestricted funds  spent by the uni-
versity last year! 
It also said, “ A payment for a 
surgery in a UC hospital can’t be redirected to fund graduate students. ” That is a half-truth. There is a sur-plus income from the UC medical enterprises, amounting to around $1 billion a year, which is distributed to faculty in the medical schools as “bonus pay. ” A portion of that money could be redirected to other press-ing academic needs in these times of budget stringency: That would be called shared sacrifice. Mark G. Yudof and the regents have authority to implement such a strategy. 
The sheet also denied that salaries 
being given to UC senior managers affected the increase in student fees, because management salaries repre-sent less than 1 percent of the total payroll at the UC system.
In previous papers, I have demon-
strated that there is a much larger con-stellation of management bureaucracy throughout the UC system, which has grown over the past decade and is now estimated to waste some $600 mil-lion per year. The Senior Management Group, which is discussed here, is just the tip of that iceberg. 
They said the primary reason stu-
dent fees rise is related to the decline in the state’s funding for per-student education at the UC system. What the university calls the 
“funding for per-student education at UC” is a piece of accounting fraud. The numbers used to calculate that actually cover all of the costs for facul-ty research work throughout the aca-demic year as well as undergraduate plus graduate educational programs. 
When I disaggregate that bundle of 
expenses, it turns out that undergrad-uate student fees now cover the full per-student cost for the UC system to provide undergraduate education. So the reduction in state funding is really a cutback in the faculty’s research pro-gram. That is a lamentable loss, but it is totally unjustified to dump that cost onto undergraduate students. These same facts also eradicate the justifica-tion for Yudof ’s claim that the state has failed to provide funds for “enrollment growth, ”  since the student fees cover 
all of that cost. 
This letter is an excerpt  of one that 
I sent to Yudof. To view the full ver-sion, visit UniversityProbe.org.

and let readers share e-books they’ve downloaded with their closest fam-ily and friends. That means everyone will want their own e-reader once its price drops, and siblings won’t try and kill one another when the next Harry Potter-esque series arrives. 
If the price isn’t a problem, but 
you’re not into Kindle’s paperback novel-size screen, another option beckons. A company called Plastic Logic has invented something just for newspaper readers, though it functions with all the same reading material as smaller screen e-readers. Instead of a relatively thick, unbend-able screen, the company has intro-duced a printer-paper-sized sheet of plastic that is larger, yet still portable.
Also, in a statement that makes me 
want to purchase the e-reader the sec-ond it comes out, the company claims the nifty device is strong enough to withstand “getting hit by a shoe. ” 
Hello, other companies? I want 
everything described in these terms. What, exactly, can I hit your product with before it breaks?
Regardless of whether you think 
the e-readers currently available are the answer, the question of the future of printing needs to be addressed. Barnes & Noble won’t do itself, or us, any good by burying its head in the sand; neither will Hearst Newspapers. If this means adopting the e-reader business model and selling their own tailored versions, they better get on it and adapt — or risk being left behind.
In the meantime, I’ll be snuggled 
up on my couch with this morning’s Times, last week’s Economist and the final chapters of “The Idiot” — all for less than last month’s cable bill. The Kindle even saves my page for me. Score.

be defined to accurately determine the 
necessity and extent of furloughs and salary reductions at each campus.
Factors to be considered would 
include the maintenance of medical center operations, the costs of preserv-ing public safety, honoring existing union contracts and following govern-mental  regulations.
“Only when we have in place these 
decision-making processes should we move forward with the actions neces-sary to respond to our changing fiscal situation, ” Yudof said.
The proposal follows the regents’ 
decision earlier this year to freeze the salaries of 300 top UC executives after the state cut $115 million in funding from the UC system. UC officials proj-ect that the deficit will climb to $450 million within the next two years due 
to the rising operational costs. 
According to Julian Posadas, exec-
utive vice president of the American 
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 3299, which represents service workers uni-versitywide, top university executives have compromised little compared to union workers, who — despite their recent contract renewals — are still paid below the state average.
“We hear cuts, but these cuts do 
not affect high executives and the UC Office of the President, ” Posadas said. “We feel the cuts need to come from where there is a budget, but we don’t hear talk about [Yudof ’s] salary being frozen or any cuts about his wages being cut at all. ”
Posadas added that Yudof has not 
considered that any cuts to under-represented worker salaries or the pos-
sibility of mandatory furloughs to all workers would compromise the com-munal aspect of the university.
“It’s going to affect the campus 
community because we won’t be able to provide quality work to faculty and staff, ” he said. “We don’t see President Yudof addressing real issues, like how students and communities will be affected by these furloughs and layoffs. ” 
Currently, the university’s payroll, 
which includes over 170,000 full-time and part-time faculty and staff, amounts to roughly $9 billion annually — not including medical and retire-ment benefits. 
Although roughly 60,000 (35 per-
cent) of those employees are protected by labor contracts that cannot be mod-ified without union approval, the uni-versity still has the authority to imple-ment furloughs and layoffs on these workers. Yudof concedes that while UC employees are an indispensable part of the university, budgetary woes can no longer sustain previous UC spending, making cuts to employee salaries necessary. 
“ As we confront all of these finan-
cial challenges, we must acknowledge that the university’s greatest asset — its human capital — comprises a sig-nificant amount of its budget, ” he said. “More than 70 percent of our core bud-get is devoted to faculty and employee salary and benefits. ”
According to UC spokesman Paul 
Schwartz, further analysis will deter-mine which employees will be impact-ed by the cuts. He added that Yudof ’s plan is not definite and represents one possible option for the university.
“[We] shouldn’t assume it’s going to 
happen — it may not, but the president  
wants to be prepared in case we think we need to move in this direction, ” Schwartz said. “It certainly would be looked upon as a last resort,  as we’re 
undertaking a broad range of measure-ments to try to cope with the state funding shortfall. ”
Posadas said workers are prepared 
to fight against any threats of salary cuts or furloughs, should the plan be favored by the regents next month.
“I think that our workers — low-
wage workers and any other workers on campus, particularly those that don’t have contracts, like clerical workers and thousands of technical workers — need to know that we do have a voice and we will be stepping up and holding UC accountable, ” Posadas said.

the campus. ” 
She encouraged parents to speak 
with students about marijuana use and their plans for April 20.
“We don’t like that our campus 
attracts people whose only reason for being here is to participate in an illegal activity, ” Burns said. “It really doesn’t portray a positive image of the uni-versity. ”  
Last year, campus police turned 
away 50 cars from Porter Meadow and issued 100 parking tickets. Burns said the university will continue curbing 4/20 activities in coming years.
Nevertheless, UCSC junior Diana 
Avenado said the use of marijuana is 
a “fairly harmless” Santa Cruz pastime that will not disappear any time soon.
“I don’t think parking restrictions 
and barricades will really do much, ” she said. “They didn’t seem to last year. ”

A Fresh-P enned  CropALL TOGETHER 
NOW: KISS, 
MAKE UP AND 
LOVE THE LOFT
We at the Guardian  spend a lot of 
time making enemies.
Granted, much of the hate 
mail and evil eyes are fired out of mis-
interpretation: No, we do not hate the Grove, just its paternal neglect; Y es, we understand the Koala  must cater 
to a horny, immature demographic, just selfishly wish it would cater to us instead; No, we do not want the A.S. candidates to die a slow, painful death, just hold them to a standard of legitima-
cy that should be demanded of anyone 
looking to take on that kind of respon-sibility. And salary. And parking spot.
OK, so we also get wildly bitter up 
here, hacking away at an unread, dead-broke rag on fucked-up computers that smell like Hi Thai. Especially when — thanks our hilarious newspaper neigh-bors down the way — we can’t even get into the second-story bathroom, three hours and pussy-ass Rockstars past deadline. Thus, oftentimes taking the critic’s cap a little — way — too seriously.
Case in point: the Loft. I personally 
have developed a sinister, death-wish-ing undersneer throughout previews for concerts at the Loft that trap-doors every complement I do manage to squeak out. Too sterile. Corporate decor. Cafeteria seating. Over -eclectic 
(yikes — that must have been a long night). Since basically every concert worth previewing is held at the Loft now, I’m of course even more bitter about having to cater to a single venue, and do everything within my name-calling powers to avoid becoming your everyday brochure-blurb noodle.
Which essentially makes me no 
better than a 2-year-old who wants her teddy bear to be missing an eye before she’s bothered to drag it along the sidewalk a block or two. It’s right time I Frisbeed some long-deserved props to that ArtPower!-born venue-ling down in the scary airport part of Price Center. Because I mean, compared to those old Mandeville quintet snores, this shit is ebonics.
And what I mean to say is: Sorry, 
Loft. I fucking love you.
Wow. So seeing as I’m being so gosh-
darn mature all of a sudden, I’ d like to ask the same of the other butt of my almost-fifth-year fury: the A.S. Council, and specifically A.S. Programming (soon to be known as A.S. Concerts and Events, praise be Allah).
As long as I’m sucking enemy toes 
here, I should say that Garrett Berg and the gang really stepped up to the Sun God plate this year. We may not get day stages and uncontested slip ’n’ slides just yet — savin’ all that for 2010, right, Gupta? — but N.E.R.D. and Girl Talk? The Cool Kids? Holy shit. This is good. Not just good in the way T.I. and Third Eye Blind were good — like, pop some E and revel in nostalgia and ridiculousness good — but creepy good, like I might even have less fun because I’m hushing the debauchery to listen good. (Do note, however, that I haven’t mentioned Iron and Wine.)

In a whirl of imaginative performances over a two-week span, the Baldwin 
New Play Festival is a purely student-run production. The on-campus series features full-length plays and staged readings from students in the MFA Playwriting Program, a synergistic effort of the entire UCSD Theatre and Dance Department.  
During the week leading up to showtime, the student playwrights 
and directors were caught in a final frenzy of production meetings and rehearsals. They come from all disciplines — from neuroscience to engineering and classical singing — but what unites them is a mutual appreciation for the visceral gusto of live theater. As “Clementine” playwright Krista Knight puts it: “When something is cool onstage it hits you in the gut. I don’t get that very often when I go to the movies. I don’t get that very often when I go to the theater, but when I do? Man. When it’s good, it’s good. ”
“Refraction”
DIRECTED BY JEFF WIENCKOWSKI
WRITTEN BY RONALD MCCANTS
Along way from “Trollmole,” the 20-pager he wrote in first grade, 
engineering major Ronald McCant’s “Refraction” unravels the more serious yarns of sexuality and racial relations.  
The tale begins after the death of a homosexual black youth at the hands of 
Rico, a Latino teenager. Compelled to reveal Rico’s murderous motives, a counselor 
at the Texas Y outh Commission tries drawing it out of him with therapy, and in this grueling process, uncovers the besmirched  past and violence of his own family.  
“I tried to be inspired by what is American, what is ours, ” McCant said, gestur-
ing charismatically. “ And I think what is ours is our family structures, our way of life, and our communities — which are extensions of our families. ”  
His own family history, in fact, provided him with a scaffold of inspiration, 
both for the new play and his playwriting career from the get-go. “My focus is storytelling, ” he said. “I grew up in a household where that’s what we’ d do — tell stories all the time. ”  
McCant also infuses a passion for engineering into his theatrics. Amid produc-
ing children’s television shows, teaching at high schools and interning, he maintains an engineer’s mechanistic outlook: “I love technology, and I’m trying to bridge a gap between technology and storytelling, ” he said. One of his many pastimes, working on his Web site Bettyit.com, explores the Internet as a storytelling vehicle.  
Still, McCant finds that the power to “milk a metaphor” can’t be found outside 
the theater. “I see it best as a place for healing, a place to observe things like a scientist. ... If the theater was just for theater people, then what good would it be?”  
 
“Refraction” will be performed live at the Mandell Weiss Forum Studio on 
April 16, 17, 22, 23 and 24 at 8 p.m.“Obscura”
DIRECTED BY  TOM DUGDALE
WRITTEN BY JENNIFER BARCLAY
Her espresso’s getting cold. But the everyday scattering of cigarette 
butts and chatter of passersby have always been enough to fuel Jennifer Barclay.
“Obscura, ” the grad student’s latest play, channels transatlantic voyeur-
ism — the stuff of indulgent Parisian c afe-goers — into a poetic and unlikely 
romance between two neighbors sharing an insomniac apartment build-ing. Sure, the quaint of cobblestone pavements along the Champs-Elysées soon yield to the uncomfortable grubbiness of everyday life, but Barclay’s enchanting fairytale retains the dreaminess of a land far, far away. 
“I’ve lived in a lot of apartments, ” Barclay said, resting her head in her 
palm. “ And I was very fascinated by the duplicity between how intimate it is and how alien it is to live smack up right next to somebody. ” In fact, just the other night, a neighbor’s food scraps funneled up through her sink. 
It’s within the collaboration and artistic vision of director Tom Dugdale 
that “Obscura’’ will rightly project itself onto the set, as a voyeuristic con-sciousness of less than polite personal habits. 
During dress rehearsal, actors parade onto the stage through the aisles — 
the distance between makeshift apartment and audience instantly vanishing — while natural lighting dispenses the room.The play is a three-ring circus, challenging our ability to follow multiple events as they unfold simultane-ously. 
“It’s like watching four different televisions at once, ” Dugdale explained. 
“We see all the apartments all the time. There are no blackouts. Everything continues. ” 
Barclay said she was inspired to become a playwright after experiencing 
the “complete transportation” and suspension of disbelief that theatrical performance can provide its audience. “Where you come out of a play, and you feel your head is just spinning and you’re just reeling, and you feel like you’ve been to a completely different universe, ” she said, “and you somehow, even if it’s in an inarticulate way, feel like you’ve been changed. ”  
“Obscura” will be performed live at the Mandell Weiss Forum Theater on 
April 17, 18, 24 and 25 at 8 p.m. Krista Knight is never short of words — they adorn her hands like temporary tattoos, decorate her fridge and animate the to-do list of her personalized Google start page. 
“It’s like I’m expecting to be called up for script duty at any minute and need to 
be armed with play ideas at the ready, ” Knight says. 
In a testament to her fascination with language, “Clementine and the Cyber 
Ducks” dabbles with the lyrics of its namesake. Revamping the practically canon-ized western folk ballad, “Clementine” welds the mid-1800s gold rush with 1990s Silicon Valley. But despite its dark examination of the American frontier’s transfor-mation, the play maintains a buoyant spirit — in the frivolity of its bar fights, loose women and steam-punk chorus of deviant ducks. 
Main character Brian, a young computer programmer, opens the play with a 
recount of last night’s bar-scapade: He met a girl, Clementine — straight from 1849. With her crippled father in tow, Clementine has traveled out west to strike it rich, only to discover it a contemporary dot-com bubble. The ensuing romance between Brian and Clementine careens into a modern day, get-rich-quick scheme: to start up an Internet search engine. But to fund the operation, Clementine and Brian get into the bad habit of wrenching money from the helpless geezer.  
In this vaudevillian Greek tragedy, the juxtaposition of time periods hints more 
profoundly at the similarities that interested its playwright from the start. 
“The song ‘Clementine’ has always struck me because of the disparity between 
this upbeat melody and the song’s internal narrative about this girl’s drowning, ” Knight said. 
And it’s this kind of unexpected cohesion that defines Krista’s playwriting career. 
As an undergraduate at Brown University, she studied neuroscience, motivated by the “precise ways of describing the known world. ” When asked about leaping across disciplines, she says, with the sophistication of a well-versed playwright, “What drew me to playwriting was the opportunity to use those same parameters, to create unique worlds. Every time I create a play, I create a world. ”

oversights) wouldn’t pass, raining on the potential awesomeness of Berg’s Sun God before it could come to frui-tion — the A.S. Council did something unforgivable. They didn’t let the Loft onto the referendum. Just in case, they defended, students wouldn’t want to shell out $3 without getting some sort of Loft oversight.
Like students know what oversight 
is. Or have any shadow of it concerning the other $2,800.
Meanwhile, A.S. Programming still 
uses the space for their own concerts — and great things happen. The No Age show was kick-ass, if kind of short, but it made one thing clear: We should all be in this together. Penny Rue was quoted as saying the university would never let the Loft die; however, that might mean chancellor brunches and “vine” tastings until we get all pruney and beg for finals week. If we want the Loft to continue as is, sticking with the “pay as you can” option, it’s time to throw down.
And paying as you can is really 
fucking crazy if you think about it. I’m paying $100 to go to Coachella this Friday when I could basically enjoy a free, week-long Coachella five minutes from my last class, any week of the year (albeit, sans Leonard Cohen. Then again, plus Jens Lekman).
So when the Loft crawls back for 
help from the new A.S. Council come inaugeration, there better be no fucking question in anybody’s mind. And that goes for you too, apathetic third-year. Y ou should feel honored  to shell out $3 
a quarter for the Loft.

The animated diary of a spunky expatriate, “Persepolis” 
airs out all those childhood memories of the Islamic 
Revolution. Based on the French graphic novel that made creator Marjane Satrapi a New York Times bestseller and 
columnist, it follows the boom of religious fundamentalism in the ’80s through precocious eyes — before they were draped in floor-length veils, not long after the fall of Iran’s monarchy

Dodgeball” director 
Rawson Marshall Thurber has decided to 
throw audiences an earnest curveball in his latest com-ing-of-age saga shadowing ’80s college grad Art Bechstein (Jon Foster) as he unclenches himself from his father’s professional-gangster grip — at least for the summer. Adapted from the 1988 novel by Pulitzer Prize win-ner Michael Chabon, “The Mysteries of Pittsburgh” means well and warm, but ulti-mately fails to conjure up any scrap of road-trip romanticism.
The film opens to Bechstein’s voiceover — 
peeled from the novel’s glass-half-empty first pages — and Thurber doesn’t let cynicism reign too long. Before we know it, he’s traded what we thought would be a self-reflective memoir for formulaic melodrama.
Making a sparkly-eyed connection with 
Jane Bellwether (the coy and smiley Sienna Miller) at an ex-roommate’s pool party, Bechstein’s minimum-wage life story at the Book Barn is put on hold. 
He’s soon interrupted by 
Bellwether’s estranged yet jeal-ous and coincidentally bisexu-al boyfriend Cleveland Arning (Peter Sarsgaard), who kidnaps 
Bechstein and playfully throws him over the rails of an abandoned steel mill — all accom-panied by stilted commentary. “It was there, sitting 300 feet above the ground staring at a lunatic, that my summer finally began, ” rambles Bechstein.
Bechstein’s childlike, hesitant affection 
for Arning predictably evolves into homo-erotic outings, chock full of life lessons. As Bellwether and Arning continue drifting apart, “Pittsburgh” strains at emotional complexity but lacks the characters to make it possible.
While Thurber does a tolerable job of craft-
ing a luminous visual tapestry — capturing a love triangle that traverses rural Pennsylvania on weekend getaways — he patches the lack of CHABON’S BISEXUAL BOYHOOD FANTASIES

■ Two Suns
ASTRALWERKS
Alchemizing Fur and Gold into low-fi tech tricks and 
pealing instrumentation, Two Suns fans Brighton-based 
lead-singer Natasha Khan’s folk fire with mystical effect. 
Clearly, the Pakistani-born Brit has matured well beyond the 
hippie hymns she yowled over a spare set three years ago. The bones from her chilly debut are still there — hand-claps, curling horns and chamber-music tribalism — just polished with a backup choir and crisp studio techniques. 
After reviving herself on “Glass” (“I will rise now/ And 
go about the city”), a pummel of drums runs through lay-ers of lithe woodwinds and harpsichord, and Khan’s pitch wanes to porcelain. Instead of relying on a minimalist appeal as in 2006, she shifts between ethereal ornamenta-tion and a somber tenor, pacing her vocals alongside the fluid tempo of “Siren’s Song” and the PJ Harvey melody of “Travelling Woman. ”
It’s the same runway off which her Mercury-nominated  style took flight, with new varnish to her woodsy mysti-cism. But even after adding ornate textures to the walls of her moonlit shanty, Khan pells through to keep some of the Old World ocher. In fact, tracks like “Moon and Moon” are some of her shaman-songwriting bests, sub-limating the animal onenes s and PETA-friendly poetics 
on Fur and Gold for proverbial mythologies in the ghostly 
vein of Hopi storytelling. 
And yet, as Wordsworthian as she’ d like us to believe 
she is, Khan’s still willing to throw in a postmodern tribute to “The Karate Kid” without us even noticing (“Daniel”). Melding outback affinities with her Gen-Y upbringings, Two Suns not only holds up the boho cords that caught 
our ears, but rubs in a spiritual salve.

The Thermals
■ Now We Can See
KILL ROCK STARS
The Thermals are the most punk-ass kids you’ll ever meet. Or at least they think they are. These shamelessly self-promoting Pitchfork darlings (sanctimoniously 8.5 
out of 10) piss-marked their territory with The Body, The 
Blood, The Machine,  a politicized “post-pop-punk classic” 
(in their own words) about a couple migrating to evangeli-cal America. But the trio’s latest post-whatever foray, Now 
We Can See, is more mediocre than manifesto, its sunny turns cross-hatched with what they insist is “neo-grunge attitude. ” 
Y ou’ve got to wonder if maybe it’s all a joke. Their 
overtly flashy, too-indie-for-you Web site bio, the Pitchfork interview in which lead singer/guitarist Hutch Harris calls himself a “recovering Catholic, ” the extended odes to drowning — it all reeks of attention-whoring. But with tracks whizzing by at three minutes or less, it’s hard to concentrate long enough to care. 
Lukewarm “We Were Sick” takes the same three-chord progressions and pounds th em to lifelessness, as Harris 
attempts an impassioned Nirvana: “Never a cure/ Never a care/ Never a need. ” But atop a head-bopping, all-togeth-er-now chorus, it ends up more family patio than squawl-ing basement. Their every-teen aura pervades “Now We Can See, ” a weaksauce social commentary buzzing with liberal guilt. “Y eah baby we were nothing/ We existed for less!/ Our present was empty/ Our history a mess!” Harris shouts in emo strain. Ten seconds of guitar solo later, he’s still foreseeing nothing but blame. 
But really, what else would you expect? Sans lyrics and 
with the volume down, the Portland punks’ 11 blendable tracks thankfully register as background noise, sappy like the Strokes but without that sweet drawl — or much else — to distinguish them.

Foster might’ve been crippled by Thurber’s decision to stay true to his novelistic inspiration (Bechstein’s passive-aggressive personality is difficult to portray on screen), but Miller — once typecast as the naive and sexually driven blonde, as in “Layer Cake” and “ Alfie” — still man-ages to strip more successfully than deliver dialogue. 
(If “Pittsburgh” has one redeem-
ing aspect, it’s undoubtedly Sarsgaard, who delivers a stunning performance as a teary-eyed roughrider right on cue.)
The film’s clumsy construction, 
masked by a saccharine narrative, leaves us wondering: What exactly was the mystery in the first place? Unfortunately,  we’ d quicker get out of the parking lot than attempt to solve it.
Clumsy Narrative Wears Edges of Unlovable Triangle
▶ PITTSBURGH, MYVTWHNLLady Sovereign
■ Jigsaw
MIDGET
Never underestimate a loudmouthed British midget. Self-proclaimed shorty Lady Sovereign wasn’t called “Mighty Mouse” for nothing (by Jay-Z, no less). Her warrior-
woman ’tude counters her wee 5-foot-1-inch frame with a vengenance that Lily Allen’s virginal soprano never could. 
“Now, who are you/ To try to rule my world now?” Sov 
raps in “Bang Bang, ” a territorial egofest that holds its own alongside some of hip-hop’s biggest prick anthems. And it is her world — from the elf-run record label all the way down to each gyrating pulse of bass and that somewhat eccentric personality.
Somewhat.What begins as awesome techno-pop mashed with 
drunken rocker sass breaks off into a series of minor identity crises. Is she an educated hipster chick strutting downtown London, or the gritty back-alley rapper who’s getting all the shout-outs? Maybe she’s the downright disgusting self-objectifier in syrup-choked “Food Play. ”  
Not that it matters much. By “Bang Bang, ” Sovereign’s 
back to trotting in the well-worn footsteps of Missy Elliot — “oi-oi-oi-pelloi” and that “bang bang” sound. 
By the time Jigsaw  is halfway over, the undercooked inse-
curity in its title track and Sovereign’s attempts to be clever in — well, the entire album — are forgotten. But with bad-ass beats and hooks catchy enough to be played on repeat Ess-Oh-Veeee delivers, and the delivery ain’t bad — just not quite sovereign.

3vs.  GRAND CANYON UNIVERSITY Baseballof the game. With one out, junior 
catcher Kellen Lee started the Triton rally with a single that sparked the eight-hit inning. Tanner singled twice for UCSD, scoring once and driving in two runners, helping UCSD to an 11-0 lead.
“Our offense can catch fire at any 
time, ” Albitz said. “ All it takes is one per-son to get it going and the entire team joins in. That person has been Josh Tanner the last month. He has been the spark plug our team has needed since opening day. I don’t know where we’ d be right now without his bat in the lineup and his glove at third base. ”
Scoring in four of the final five 
innings, the Tritons plated a season-high 20 runners, completing the feat in a seven-inning game.
The crooked numbers continued 
into the second game of the day as the Tritons put up a four-spot in the top of the first inning in what would be UCSD and Grand Canyon’s final game of the series. As the first four batters in the Triton lineup, Albitz, Imeson, Kehoe and Cantele all hit safely in the opening inning and contributed nine of UCSD’s 13 total hits in the game.
“We knew that if we did our job on 
offense, we would score runs and take some pressure off our pitching staff, ” Kehoe said. “Our hitters did a great job of hitting barrel heads all weekend. ”
The Tritons scored one run in each 
of the next two innings, giving them a 6-0 advantage, leading to the 9-4 win. 
Seven Tritons hit for extra bases 
in the game, including Albitz, whose triple in the second inning was his first of the season. Winning pitcher senior Trevor Decker allowed one run over five innings for his fifth victory. 
The fourth game of the series, 
scheduled for April 12, was cancelled due to inclement weather.
With the sweep, UCSD (25-8, 
19-5 CCAA) remains in first place in conference with a three-game lead over Sonoma State University and Cal State Los Angeles. UCSD will now face fourth-place Cal State Dominguez Hills (25-16, 14-10 CCAA) for two games at home — where the Tritons have a 10-game winning streak — and two on the road.
“Cal State Dominguez Hills is going 
to be a solid CCAA team, much like the rest of our conference, ” Imeson said. “ As long as we stick to our game and attack their weaknesses we will have a good series. Playing at home is always great. Weather, supportive fans and a great field make us very happy to be home. ”
Readers can contact Janani Sridharan 
at jsridhar@ucsd.edu.“Laiah is running spectacularly, ” 
women’s head coach Darcy Ahner said. “She’s an incredible competitor and she really knows how to stay focused. ”
The UCSD 4x400-meter team also 
performed well, finishing seventh in a race that was won by a world-class  
team, which included two Olympic athletes. The relay team of Merrill, Skorupa, sophomore Deyna Roberson and junior Anna Lee McGregor earned an NCAA automatic qualifying time.
Sophomore Stephanie LeFever won 
the long jump, edging out sophomore Jasmine Pickett of Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo  to win with a mark of 5.71 
meters. The Tritons also had a third-place finish from senior Sarah Hendy in the discus, whose mark of 160’11” was a personal best and second all-time in school history. 
Sophomore Bre Schofield was the 
distance standout for the Tritons, as her time of 2:14.73 in the 800-meter  
run was good for ninth overall and was a NCAA provisional qualifying mark. Senior Ashleigh Montgomery finished 10th in the same race, less than one second behind Schofield.
On the men’s side, senior Scott 
Tsuda won the long jump with a mark of 48’2” , only a half inch short of the 
school record he already owns. Junior Fred Cook also won for the Tritons in the hammer throw, with a per-sonal best of 170’10” . The mark was the eighth best in UCSD history. 
Junior Casey Ryan, who set the 
record in the high jump last week, fin-ished fifth in his event with a mark of 6’8.75” . The high jump event was won by former Olympian James Nieto.
Salerno stressed the importance of 
facing elite competition in order for the team to achieve its full potential.
“It’s really critical and something 
we think is important to our program, ” he said. “It’s an opportunity for us to redefine what we think we’re capable of. The term we use in coaching is ‘taking the lid off, ’ where athletes can see what else is out there and redefine what they think they can do. ”
The Tritons compete again on 
April 18 at the Long Beach Invitational before coming home for the Triton Invitational on April 24.

UCSD continued its dominance in 
singles, dropping only one set over the six matches. Freshman William McCall had the most convincing win of the day, beating freshman William Kellar  6-0, 6-1. Dixit was the only one 
who had to battle, completing the clean sweep for UCSD with a hard-fought 7-6, 3-6, 7-1 win over junior  Rashad 
Khamis.
“We’ve got two matches left in the 
season, and we need to continue the momentum we were able to get in Colorado, ” Negishi said. “With the way our team has been playing in practice, I expect that we can accom-plish that and feel good about going into regionals. ”
The Tritons are set to finish the reg-
ular season this week as they face two more matches on the road. On Friday afternoon they will head north to face Sonoma State University. The road trip will continue the next day with a tilt against UC Santa Cruz.

Staff Writer
MEN’S CREW — If you ask any rower, they’ll tell you that spring is the most exciting time of the year. As one of few collegiate sports that athletes practice year round, fall season  is dedicated to 
building rowers’ technical proficiency while improving strength and endur-ance so that by the time spring rac-ing season rolls around, athletes are primed — not to mention eager — to show their hard work and finally face their competitors.
In a sport where all battles take 
place on the water, spring races are the most important selection criteria for the post-season invitation rowing championships.  
Racing in the San Diego Crew 
Classic, held on April 4 and 5 at Mission Bay, the varsity eight boat stole the spotlight with a first-place finish in the grand final, capturing the Cal Cup.
“From day one in October of this 
season we focused on the big races in the spring, including the [San Diego] Crew Classic, ” sophomore Justin Gordon said. “Our new training regi-ment over the last six months prepared us to be very competitive this spring and it was validated with our win at Crew Classic. … Everyone wants the same thing, to win the [Western Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championships]. We trust that the other eight people in our boat are willing to put themselves through hell to achieve that. This year we have the potential to be the most successful crew UCSD has ever seen and that has been providing great motivation for the team. ” 
Originally told that they weren’t 
competitive enough to be legiti-mate challengers, the Tritons shat-tered that judgment once they hit the water. Shadowing Sacramento State University during the first 500 meters, UCSD was able to draw even by the halfway point before it pulled away in the third quarter to coast to vic-tory with a final time of 6:28.18. Left to follow in the Tritons’ wake were crosstown rival University of San Diego (6:31.04) in second, Orange Coast College (6:36.04) in third, Santa Clara University (6:36.75) in fourth and Sacramento State (6:37.16) in fifth. Bringing up the rear was UCLA with a time of 6:40.51.    
“One of the strong points on our 
team this year that really makes our boats move aggressively is the compet-itiveness that we have within our own 
program, ” senior co-captain Jonathan 
Lynch said. “In practice, each boat attempts to win everything from the warm-up to the cool down. We are never satisfied. Every piece, and every drill throughout practice,  we always 
want to beat each other by more than the last time. Practicing with this men-tality really allows us to come into race day mentally prepped for the challenge we have at hand. ”
The winning varsity eight crew con-
sisted of junior Andrew Hilton, senior co-captain Ryan Andre, junior Jay Dee Morgan, senior Jeff Collett, sophomore Kris Grey, freshman Nathan Morgan, junior Karam Badran, Gordon and junior coxswain Cameran Biltucci.
Rewardingly, the varsity eight 
boat’s prevailing first place finish secures it a spot in next year’s presti-gious Copley Cup. The Tritons, who appeared in the Copley Cup in 2008 after a victory in the Cal Cup in 2007, were strangely not invited back to the event this year.
“From the beginning, we were in 
a shadow of doubt from the rowing community, ” Gordon said. “Instead of being in the Copley Cup, we were in the Cal Cup and we were seeded behind crews we had already beaten earlier in the season. We attacked each race with the goal to prove to every-one, including ourselves, that UCSD is a legitimate contender this year and we plan on doing very well. We basi-cally wanted to make the Crew Classic committee check themselves and feel bashful for doubting us. ” 
After the day’s results, it is unlikely 
that anyone will doubt the Tritons again this season. Equally impressive was UCSD’s junior varsity eight ‘ A ’ squad, who also seized a first-place finish competing in the petite final. Crossing the finish line at 6:28.70, the Tritons glided ahead of UC Davis (6:34.27), Santa Clara University (6:30.04), UCLA (6:40.27) and the  
University of Colorado (6:41.85). 
This weekend, the Tritons are back 
on the water as they take part in the 44th annual regatta in Newport Beach. UCSD will then shoot for a sixth straight San Diego City Championship on April 19 at Mission Bay.  
“Given the results from our previ-
ous races with USD and OCC,  we are 
expecting to do very well, ” Gordon said. “This weekend we have the opportu-nity to make a strong statement going into the last couple weeks of training before our conference championships. Hopefully we send out a clear message that we mean business and everyone else will be racing for second. ”

TRACK & FIELD — As school records 
continue falling, the Tritons once again proved they have no problem going against tough competition.
The women’s 4x100-meter  relay 
team set a university record and three athletes recorded wins in their events. The track and field team had a strong showing at the UCLA Rafer Johnson/Jackie Joyner-Kersee Invitational from April 9 to April 11. The field included mostly Division-I programs and sev-eral world-class athletes. 
“The team generally did really 
well, ” men’s head coach Tony Salerno said. “We’re at the point where we can get on the track at a place like UCLA to compete and do very well. ”
The women’s team was led by 
the 4x100 team, which consisted of junior Christine Merrill, senior Katie Skorupa, sophomore Kelly Fogarty and senior Laiah Blue. Their time of 46.75 seconds was the fastest ever for UCSD and was also a NCAA provisional qual-ifying performance. Blue had an excep-tional meet all around, competing in the 100- and 400-meter hurdles and 
earning an NCAA automatic qualify-ing time, as well as  a provisional quali-
fying time, respectively. On Monday, Blue was named California Collegiate Athletic Association Women’s Track and Field Athlete of the Week for her performance.By Neil Joshi

TENNIS — The Tritons embarked on 
their longest excursion of the season, traveling to Colorado for three match-es last weekend to push their record back to 10-10 overall. UCSD has had its share of struggles this season, but with a 4-2 record in its last six matches, the Tritons are finally beginning to hit their stride. With the regular season quickly coming to a close, head coach Eric Steidlmayer would like noth-ing more than to see his team begin rounding into form.
“I’ve really been able to find a con-
sistent lineup that I can turn to, and that’s been the biggest key for our team’s success lately, ” Steidlmayer said. “With regionals coming up, we need our team to be approaching its peak if we hope to compete with some of the best teams in our area. ”
The Tritons began their road trip 
against Colorado Christian University in Lakewood, Colo., early Saturday morning, blowing out the Cougars 9-0. Many of Colorado Christian’s play-ers were battling injuries as well as food poisoning, causing the team to default the third doubles and sixth singles matches to UCSD before they even started. Two other matches, the third and fifth singles, were completed shortly after they began. The other five matches that played to completion weren’t any more suspenseful as the Tritons dominated from start to finish.
UCSD’s top doubles team of senior 
Kazumi Negishi and sophomore Erik Elliott sent a statement early by rout-ing Colorado Christian’s freshman Matthew Cooper and junior Andrew Wren by an 8-0 score. Negishi was just as impressive in his singles match at

BASEBALL — Rain may have can-
celled the Tritons’ final game against Grand Canyon University last Saturday but it was UCSD’s lineup that poured on the hits last weekend in Arizona. The No. 6 Tritons outscored the Antelopes 36 runs to nine in the shortened series on April 9 and 10, including a 20-5 bashing in the second match. The Tritons faced little opposi-tion in the bookend games as well, shutting the Antelopes out 7-0 to start the three-game set and closing out the matchup with a 9-4 victory.
Following the series, UCSD was 
ranked No. 1 in the first NCAA Division-II West Regional poll of the season. The Tritons will take that top ranking into conference play April 16 and 17 at home against Cal State Dominguez Hills — ranked sixth in the recent poll — still sitting atop the California Collegiate Athletic Association standings.
Wasting no time against the 
Antelopes, junior shortstop Vance Albitz led off the series with a sin-gle to right field. With senior second baseman Garrett Imeson up to bat, Albitz stole second, setting the stage for Imeson’s RBI single to centerfield that gave the Tritons a 1-0 lead.
“Our offensive approach was to 
grind the pitching staff out, ” Imeson said. “We knew they didn’t have a very deep bullpen, so jumping on them early was a priority. ”
UCSD continued scoring, putting 
up runs in three of the first five innings and taking a 4-0 lead with sophomore pitcher Tim Shibuya dealing on the mound. Holding on to their four-run advantage, the Tritons broke the game open in the top of the ninth with senior first baseman Matt Cantele coming up with a big two-run double in the 7-0 win.
The Triton offense tallied 15 total 
hits with Albitz, Imeson, junior out-fielder Robert Sedin and senior third baseman Josh Tanner recording multi-hit games. Shibuya held the Antelopes to four hits over eight shutout innings before senior Ryland MacFayden fin-ished up the game, pitching a scoreless ninth.
“Shibuya is a spectacular pitcher, ” 
Imeson said. “He has poise, good stuff, command and competes. His perfor-mance on the mound against Grand Canyon reflects the special type of pitcher he is. ”
UCSD’s lineup gave its second-game starter, redshirt junior Matt Rossman, a sizeable lead to work with in the second inning alone. The Tritons sent 12 batters to the plate, scoring nine runs — adding to their two scores in the first — and driv-ing the Antelopes’ starting pitcher out
