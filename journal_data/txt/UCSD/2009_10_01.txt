In late June, UCSD became 
the nation’s first public university 
to offer its students iPhone access 
to campus-related information. 
The first version 
of the application was downloaded by 2,100 users in the first two days. 
An early glitch 
allowed public access 
to unauthorized personal informa-tion through the directory feature, 
but was fixed within a few hours. According to Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Administrative 
Computing Elazar Harel, student response has been overwhelmingly positive.
Over 8,000 people have down-
loaded the latest Version 1.1, released a few weeks ago and includ-ing podcast capability, news sources, athletics updates, video links and a feature that allows users to monitor the exact location of campus shuttles in real time. 
The most popular facets of the 
application are the campus map, shuttle, directory and course fea-tures, Harel said.
University spokesperson Rex 
Graham praised the thorough nature of the application, particularly the map feature. 
Harel emphasized the impor-
tance of student involvement in the development of the application. <*)<+.,;*90:0:

Four months after a controversial A.S. Council vote nearly shut down the Student Center’s Grove Caffe, top councilmembers are moving 
forward with plans to renovate and restructure the student-run business over the next several weeks. 
A.S. President Utsav Gupta, along with several 
leading cabinet members, has worked closely with Grove student manager Thomas Frank over the last two weeks to generate a new business plan capable of pulling the cafe out of its nearly $130,000 debt. 
The Grove has suf-
fered financially since its conception, struggling to draw a profit amid grow-ing competition from new campus coffee shops, heavy turnover among its student employees and diminished campus visibility. 
The cafe’s debt more than 
doubled last year, after coun-cilmembers voted to hire former manager Cleveland Thomas as a full-time employ-ee — breaking from the Grove’s student-run model and incur-ring a cost of $45,000 over the course of a year to pay Thomas’ salary. Despite Grove’s longterm financial 
struggles, councilmembers remain optimistic about new business plans.+W]VKQT5W^M[.WZ_IZL?Q\P+INM:M^IUX

National concern about the spread 
of the H1N1 flu virus — common-
ly known as the “swine flu” — has prompted campus officials to prepare  once again for a potential campus epidemic.
According to Student Health 
Services Director Gina Fleming, UCSD officials have spent the sum-mer preparing for the threat of a renewed outbreak, primarily by spreading awareness about how to avoid catching the virus.
The Student Health Center 
is anticipating a shipment of the swine-flu vaccine from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which should be available by early November.
“We are hoping to be able to have 
enough for everyone, ” Fleming said.
Temporary vaccination clinics 
w i l l  b e  s e t  u p  a r o u n d  c a m p u s  t o  cope with the large influx of people expected to seek the vaccine.
Currently, the Health Center 
holds a limited amount  of seasonal 
flu vaccinations available for students with pre-existing conditions — con-ditions which may leave them more vulnerable to the swine flu virus, Fleming said.
Get-Well Kits — containing 
a thermometer, throat lozenges, Tylenol, hand sanitizer and tissues — are now available for $5 at the Student Health Center. 
“The most important item in the JOHN HANACEK /GUARDIAN
Undergraduate activists met last night to discuss Sept. 24th’s campus walkout. Although all present agreed the protest against potential 
student fee hikes and budget cuts was an overall success, some felt that the rally lacked organization and offered suggestions for future events. Health Center heads 
awareness campaign;  vaccinations to be offered by November.

Declaring solidarity with the students, faculty 
and staff who participated in the Sept. 24 system-wide campus walkouts, the A.S. Council passed a resolution last night endorsing the protests and condemning the UC Board of Regents’ proposed fee increases. 
A virtually identical resolution, drafted by 
UCSD A.S. Vice President of External Affairs Gracelynne West, was passed by the UC Students Association on Sept. 13.  
“We really tried to make [the resolution] 
all-inclusive, both to students affected by priva-tization and lack of public funding, but also to faculty and grad students, ” West said. “The effects of these budget cuts are going to be widely felt by

“We tried to think about what 
students do when they’re mobile 
and walking around, and based the first feature ideas off that concept, ” Harel said. 
The project began last May, when 
UCSD-app creators met with the iPhone Application Programming Club — an organization dedicated to sharing ideas, earning developers’ licences and creating applications. 
Given the growing popularity of 
the application, there is discussion of future developments and collabora-tions with the club. 
Currently, programmers are 
working on Mobile UCSD, an ini-tiative launched to develop web-based applications with similar fea-tures that can work with all types of phones. 
“Not everyone has an iPhone, ” 
Harel said. “We wanted to come up with something for the common denominator. ”
An application will be available 
for Blackberry phones by the end of the year, he said, and an updated iPhone application — which will include a calendar of campus events  — is slated for release in December or January.
Programmers are also consid-
ering adding increased news net-working, alumni information, the capability to make purchases at the UCSD Bookstore or a tool that locates a user’s proximity to sculp-tures from the Stuart Art Collection. 
Harel credits collaboration 
with the Palo Alto-based applica-tion development company Terribly Clever for the success of the UCSD application; the company was responsible for designing the user interface, fed by live information provided by the university.
Stanford and Duke are the only 
other universities to offer similar phone applications.
“Other universities are just start-
ing to have their applications, but we’re definitely the first [public uni-versity], and the others aren’t nearly as comprehensive and cool as the one UCSD has, ” Graham said. 
With improvements constantly 
in development, Harel said that the applications design team always wel-comes feedback and suggestions. 
“We’re very excited, ” Harel said. 
“We hope people enjoy it.

NEWS THURSDAY , OCTOBER 1, 2009  THE UCSD GUARDIAN 3 
With Thomas gone, the cafe is 
again fully student-operated.
“We didn’t really change anything 
last year, ” Gupta said. “What we did 
is we added a full-time manager, which is responsible for most of the additional debt. ”
Gupta — who campaigned heav-
ily on plans to preserve and revamp the Grove during last year’s A.S. presidential election — has made the eatery a top priority for his first quarter in office. 
The Grove is currently operating 
at partial capacity — serving only coffee and pastries — in order to cope with the changes being imple-mented. Within two weeks, the eat-ery will shut down completely while major structural renovations take place, including a new deck and the installation of new interior flooring.
“In order to compete with all 
these new places that seem to be popping up every six minutes, we need to look good, ” Frank said.
Frank and Gupta acknowledged 
that the cafe’s debt will increase before the renovations are complete. They estimated the deck alone will cost up to $10,000, while the installation of a new conveyor oven — similar to the ones seen at Quiznos restaurants — will cost approximately $4,000.
The cost of replacing the eat-
ery’s interior flooring has yet to be assessed.
“We’re going to have to build 
upon the debt to bring us out of debt, ” Gupta said.
Frank also intends to reinvent the 
eatery’s menu, in an effort to simplify the customer experience and speed up service. They hope to strip the Grove’s daytime offerings down to sandwiches and pizzas while imple-menting assembly-line food prepara-tion.
“We’re going to simplify the way 
you order food at the Grove, ” Gupta said. “We’re going to take concepts from Chipotle and from In-N-Out and really make it simple to see what we offer — and we’re going to reduce what we offer. ”
Gupta has also discussed extend-
ing the Grove’s hours of operation past 9 p.m. — a move that would to capitalize on the lack of late-night eateries available on campus. 
“The idea is to appeal to stu-
dents coming back from parties or students who are up late studying who want somewhere to find good food, ” Associate Vice President of Enterprise Operations Rishi Ghosh said. “There’s a void on campus right now for that kind of service. ”
Gupta said one focus of the eat-
ery’s revamp will be a renewed pub-licity campaign — an effort to attract new business to the Grove and move away from its reputation as strictly a 
coffee shop. 
The A.S. Graphic studio plans to 
design flyers and posters advertising the Grove, to be distributed through-out campus. 
Ghosh said the council will 
absorb the cost of the campaign.
“We’re taking a realistic approach 
based on the market, ” Gupta said. “There’s no dining hall in Muir. There’s no dining hall in the School of Medicine. Students want more choice in terms of where they spend their money. Students don’t really see the Grove as a food place — they see us more as a coffee place, which is accurate, but it’s not all we provide. We’re going to re-advertise ourselves as the Grove the restaurant, and not just the Grove the cafe”
Gupta, Frank, Ghosh and Vice 
President of Finance and Resources Peter Benesch hope to premier  the Grove in its new form by Five Week. They have discussed offering a full week of free food items in order to attract customers. 
“We’re going to make it so nobody 
can not know about the Grove, ” Gupta said. “We’re going to be offer-ing free food, free sandwiches. We definitely intend to see thousands of people try out the Grove in its first week of new operation. ”

2009-10 academic year with a four-hour meeting yesterday 
night. Highlights included a presenta-tion on the current UC budget crisis and a debate over whether the council should continue funding the Koala  
campus newspaper.
Before things got heated, the A.S. 
Graphics Studio team welcomed the new council by taking a group shot of the members for their latest project: a “Who’s Who in A.S. ” brochure.
With the 
photo op over, President Utsav  
Gupta  introduced 
Akos Rona-Tas — a UCSD sociology professor — to present a lengthy, graph-heavy slide-show on the state of the UC budget.
A key slide in the presentation 
evaluated the amount of money that the state of California spends on a UC student versus a prison inmate. Rona-Tas pointed out that the state spends approximately $46,000 per year on one inmate, next to a mere $9,560 on the average UC student. 
Gupta called the presentation “one 
of the most useful so far, ” and was echoed by a roomful of snaps (signi-fying agreement).
Miscommunication between the 
council and the speech-policy com-mittee caused the committee’s special presentation to be pushed to next week.
Campuswide Senator Katie  Hall  
presented plans for UCSD’s 50th anniversary celebration. Three main events — Founder’s Day, Innovation UCSD and Green Open House — will commemorate the yearlong event throughout 2010-11.
Gupta then addressed a plan sug-
gesting that the Sun God Festival date be changed from the traditional Friday of Week 7 (during Spring Quarter) to Friday of Week 6, which precedes Mother’s Day weekend. The change was suggested to avoid con-flict with a “potential softball game” at RIMAC Field.
However, Gupta disagreed. “I don’t want people having to 
choose between their mothers and a popular campus tradition, ” Gupta said.
Marshall Senator Brian  McEuen  
began the Koala 
funding debate by politely condemn-ing the comedy newspaper’s most recent issue for poking fun at sec-ond-year Revelle student-athlete 
Leon Roach, who was killed in a pole-vaulting accident this September.
Councilmembers were split on 
whether they should continue fund-ing such a controversial newspaper. 
“Y ou guys say you’re support-
ive of free speech, but we have to take the blows that come with it, ” said Campuswide Senator Adam  
Kenworthy .
After much discussion, the council 
voted to continue funding the Koala .
It took only a few seconds for 
the council to unanimously approve a resolution — authored by VP External Affairs Gracelynne West — 
in support of the systemwide walkout on Sept. 24. 
As the meeting drew to a close, 
dreary-eyed councilmembers perked up to sing “Happy Birthday” to Warren Senator Emily Law. 
In closing, Campuswide Senator 
Wafa Ben Hassine took a moment to let fellow councilmembers know she was excited to work with them, and that she really liked everyone.+W]VKQT>W\M[\W+WV\QV]M.]VLQVO

There’s no doubt you’ve already 
heard: Our beloved univer-sity is in a dire financial cri-
sis. The state went broke, didn’t give the UC its $813.2 million when we thought it would — and then all hell broke loose. 
UC President Mark G. Yudof 
declared emergency powers in July — despite disapproval from the sys-temwide Academic Senate and many other bystanders — and has since cut employee salaries by 10 percent, 
employed mandatory furloughs for UC pro-fessors and staff and proposed to hike stu-dent fees by 32 per-
cent for 2010-11. 
His actions are 
based on a simple 
premise that he explained in his June 
22 furlough proposal: “There are no perfect choices for how to achieve the needed cost-savings. ” He said that value should be placed on a plan that “reflects an appropriate balance cen-tered on fairness and sacrifice. ” 
True — but Yudof seems to have a 
different definition of what’s fair. 
Hiking next year’s fees by 32 per-
cent is not fair to students who have struggled to afford an education since fees began steadily rising eight years ago. Neither is cutting 10 percent from already meager salaries.
A less-accessible and therefore 
more privatized public univer-sity not only contradicts the UC’s founding principles, but it also hurts California’s chances of bouncing back from its current financial dilemma. An educated workforce has played a crucial role in California’s past suc-cess: Both Silicon Valley and San Diego’s biotech industries have ben-efitted from the talent, research funds and capital tied to the UC system. 
The regents must explore other 
options before cutting from essen-tials. These include: reducing the salaries of the top 2 percent of UC earners, considering use of the UC medical centers’ profits to preserve basic academic essentials and utiliz-ing funds from the UC’s short-term investment portfolio. 
Since the start of this budget cri-
sis, Yudof has defended high-paying executives and insisted that the uni-versity maintain “competitive” mar-ket prices to retain essential talent. But if we’re already so desperate as to cut most employee salaries while demanding more from struggling students, we can no longer offer the 
same high-end salaries as our peer 
universities.
We back the American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 3299’s recommen-dation to reduce the top 2 percent of University of California earners. This cut would apply to roughly 3,600 individuals earning over $200,000 per year, and free $220 million for 
other critical priorities. 
This would, granted, apply dis-
proportionately higher cuts to those 
earning more. Employing different cuts for four income levels, AFSCME recommends cutting 18 percent from all wages ranging from $200,000 to $225,000, and 24 percent from all those above $300,000.
In other words salary cuts to a few 
thousand top executives would yield $20 million more than Yudof ’s pro-posal to raise fees for all 220,000 UC students.
More than anything, 
the UC leadership’s will-ingness to sacrifice their luxuries for the greater good of our institution would unite them with workers and students in coping with the strained economy. 
Yudof has also 
ignored any possibility of temporarily utilizing the UC medical centers’ high profits to offset some of the academic slashing. According to AFSCME Local 3299, if the UC medical centers continue with the financial success reported in the first nine months of the fis-cal year, they could potentially have earned over $200 million in profits for the most recent fiscal year.
Though medical centers’ net prof-
its are set aside to serve a specific function, Yudof should at least con-sider using a small percentage of 
that cash to fill in gaping holes at the 
operational level. After all, the 1997-98 Budget for Current Operations shows that UC execs used medi-cal-center assets to meet emergency needs during the budget crises of 1993 and 1995.
Though it’s unclear whether our 
medical center would be able to lend us a hand, we’ll never know without a 
push from Yudof himself.
Currently, the UC also holds an 
investment portfolio chock full of 
liquid assets.
Though much of the portfolio is 
restricted to fund different programs, $1.4 billion of its assets are allocated to the Mortgage Orientation Program — a system that allows UC executives and tenured faculty to take out low-interest loans through the university.
Currently, $800 million dollars of 
the fund’s reserves are unused. We suggest using these reserves to fill the 
gaps in core operations. According to AFSCME, it could offset up to 98 percent of the state’s reduction to our gener-al-funds revenue.
Even if it means 
freezing complimen-tary low-interest loans for UC hotshots, it would aid those at the bottom who don’t have the privilege to such monetary aid but des-perately need it.
Not to mention, in 
1993, the University of California used $43 mil-lion of short-term invest-ment funds to alleviate budgetary problems. If it was a possibility then, 
Yudof should consider it now, too.
Though we do not expect the uni-
versity to rip apart its every last asset to save our education, we do expect Yudof to get much more creative before he raises student fees and cuts staff salaries. For those of us who can’t hold on much longer, it’s the only fair thing to do.

The UCSD Guardian  is published twice a week at 
the University of California at San Diego. Contents © 
2007. Views expressed herein represent the majority 
vote of the editorial board and are not necessarily 
those of the UC Board of Regents, the ASUCSD or 
the members of the Guardian  staff. Last Thursday’s walkout was the largest protest I’ve ever witnessed at UCSD. 
But it’s one thing to miss a 
single day of syllabus handouts, and quite another to protest for days, weeks, months — however long it takes — to ensure our fees don’t skyrocket and our services don’t dwindle. 
While studying abroad in France 
last year, I witnessed a national uprise of students who saw a threat to public education and reacted with nine weeks of protests. 
My university, Sciences-Po Lyon, 
and other schools across the coun-try boycotted the classroom for the same reasons that drove students to storm lecture halls on the first day of instruction here at UCSD: rising tuition costs, the demand for uni-versal access to a quality education and uncertainty about the future of public education itself. 
The students at my French uni-
versity were upset because tuition had risen to just under 2,000 euros — a 10-percent increase. That’s chump change next to Yudof ’s pro-posal to increase fees 32 percent.
Relative to our tuition, French 
students are charged peanuts. But that didn’t stop them from fight-ing even harder. Seeing students march through the streets made me question whether my own country values education as much as France does. 
Understandably, some American 
students in my program weren’t thrilled to have such a large part of their year abroad disrupted by a movement in which they weren’t invested. But I saw it as cultural immersion at its finest: What’s more French than weeks of block-ading university buildings and dis-cussing the movement’s future over bottles of wine? 
Without a doubt, the most 
nerve-racking — and, in the end, rewarding — moment of my entire year abroad was when I stood before 700 French students at one of my university’s general assem-blies and delivered an impromptu speech about the need to set an example for students worldwide. Clearly, the French aren’t the only ones facing threats to higher educa-tion. My hands had long stopped trembling by the time I wrapped up my main point: Their movement’s 
success could inspire the courage 
in others to ignite movements of its 
kind globally.
I couldn’t have anticipated a bet-
ter lesson in linguistics: When you speak to hundreds of your foreign peers about their own country’s problems, you better be damn sure to use the right form of subjunctive.
As the movement progressed, 
I came to view the protests as a 
necessary part of my young-adult 
education. I was surrounded by a mass of students who were not only outspoken about their current grievances, but were also willing to take a stand for the future of public

universities, to which they believe 
every citizen should have equal access. 
Some UCSD students told me 
they didn’t walk out because they didn’t want to waste a moment of their already overpriced education, and it seemed others simply didn’t know what the hell was going on. 
Y et every day at Sciences Po, 
there were dozens of student orga-nizers handing out pamphlets, lead-ing informational discussions and planning demonstrations. Instead of ignoring fellow students shout-ing and marching by — as so many of us did during the walkout — most French students would at least participate in the public debate, regardless of where their loyalties laid. Students couldn’t return from a single day of school without an armful of fliers outlining the pro-testors’ demands. 
UCSD’s walkout, however, 
offered no literature to students who were intrigued by the mob’s action yet didn’t know what it was about. 
In France, general assemblies 
were held at specific times each week; every march through the city had a set route. This level of organization lent the movement a legitimacy ours lacked. Last week, all we managed to do (and I say this not to criticize, but to moti-vate) was disrupt class. Shouting “W ALK OUT PETERSON!” doesn’t begin to inform students about why they should walk out and what they can do personally to help the move-ment.  
Until we exhibit the same level 
of dedication in our protest that my French peers did, the administra-tion won’t take us seriously. The art of effective protest involves more than aimless shouting and blind rage; it requires both clear direction and widespread education. We’ d be wise to take a few tips from the sauvignon blanc-sipping experts across the Atlantic — because no one knows how to riot like the French.

 By Christina Aushana
Dear Editor,
I would like to take exception to 
the statement made in Trevor Cox’s 
article (“We Need an Education, Not a Podcast, ” run on Sept. 24): “Or do we accept the fact that, for now, we can’t afford to keep the expensive professors and research that gave the university its esteemed reputation?”
As one of those you mention, I 
note the following:
I pay 100 percent of my sal-
ary from my research funds and teach at no cost to the University of California. 
The construction of the building 
I work in was paid for and is main-tained by grant funds, even though it supports education.
When I hire an undergraduate 
part-time during the school year, I am personally providing financial aid using my grant funds.
And when an undergraduate does 
independent-study research in my lab, I am paying for costs associated with his or her education with my grant funds.
In fact, the UC system has never 
spent any money on me or my lab.
Thus, I’m not sure exactly how 
people like me make the UC system more costly.More interestingly, because of 
people like me, the UC system has a very successful research and clinical program that accounts for more than 75 percent of the UC budget — virtu-ally all of which is financed by funds the faculty raise. If you calculate how much state and local taxes are paid due to the expenditure of the UC budget, it ranges from a low of $2.1 billion to a high of $2.3 billion per year. Which is basically to say that because of its large research and clini-cal enterprise, the UC system doesn’t, in net, cost the state anything.
Isn’t the solution to accurately 
explain the UC system’s financial situ-ation, and thus, argue for a realistic level of state support that would result in lowering tuition to what it was in the ‘60s and ‘70s, when the UC mas-ter plan was last in force?

While the council held its weekly 
meeting in Price Center East and 
discussed the new resolution, the group that organized the campus walkout — the UCSD Coalition to Save Our Futures — came togeth-er two floors below at the Cross-Cultural Center to discuss the Coalition’s next move. 
Though the group’s ultimate goal 
is a large-scale rally at the Nov. 17 regents meeting at UCLA — where university officials will vote on the proposed 32-percent student-fee increase — there are several other projects the coalition plans to tackle in the meantime.
Until then, the group’s main pri-
ority is increasing public awareness about the university’s current budget crisis.
“We’ll be having further teach-
ins throughout the year, reaching out to organizations, trying to be o n  L i b r a r y  W a l k  a s  m u c h  a s  p o s -sible, ” West said. “[We’ll] continue to talk to students, keeping them informed and letting them know about [things] like the resolution we just passed. ”
The first of several planned 
teach-ins will take place on Oct. 14. The Coalition also has other projects in motion: These include lobbying legislators at both local and state levels, passing out fly-ers on Library Walk and demand-ing a larger role for undergraduates in the university’s newly proposed Senate-Administration Task Force on Budget. 
A series of subcommittees has 
been created to handle the various aspects of the coalition’s efforts. 
“We didn’t educate as many stu-
dents as we’ d have liked to [before the walkout], ” Revelle College senior  Sam Jung, who lead the discussion at the Coalition meeting, said. “We basically had five days to get this rally and this teach-in together, so we did bomb."

said. “Once you’re sick, you should stay away from others until your fever has been gone for 24 hours … Using the thermometer can help you monitor whether you are ready to come back into contact with other people. ”
The center has maintained week-
ly communication with the county and the state, geared specifically toward emergency response and prevention.
“We never stop planning, ” 
Fleming said.
UCSD has also begun accept-
ing  a number of additional health-care providers, allowing the Student Health Center to see more students on a daily basis. 
Additionally, a separate waiting 
area for students with influenza-like symptoms has been set up at the center  to prevent contamina-
tion —though Fleming said students should not visit the center seeking  a swine-flu test, as it is only available to those patients admitted to the intensive-care unit.
 “Whether you have swine flu or not doesn’t affect treatment options or recommendations, ” Fleming said.
According to Fleming, people 
under the age of 24 are particu-larly at risk for contracting the virus, because of certain behaviors. 
For example,  she said, they tend 
to share food and drinks, often forget to cover their mouths when coughing or sneezing and neglect to wash their hands thoroughly.
In addition, a college setting puts 
young people in daily contact with thousands of other students and fac-ulty members, making them par-ticularly vulnerable to the swine-flu virus.
Campuses around the country 
have felt the effects of the virus this year.
For example, at UC Berkeley, 
there were a reported 40 to 50 cases of flu-like symptoms per week dur-ing the summer alone.
Over 600 cases of swine flu have 
been reported at Cornell University since August. One 20-year-old  stu-
dent reportedly died due to compli-cations with the H1N1 virus. 
Emory University in Georgia, has 
seen over 200 reported cases of the swine flu, and has set aside a dorm area for H1N1 patients to recover.
In order to help prevent the 
spread of the virus, Flemings rec-ommends that students wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, cover their mouth when coughing or sneezing and avoid sharing beverages. 
Additionally, at the CDC’s recom-
mendation, Student Heath Services has implemented a buddy system.
If a student is feeling ill and 
wants someone to check up on them or bring them food and fluids, they can email flubuddy@ucsd.edu , and a 
Student Health Advocate will come to his or her assistance.
Student Health representatives  
recommend that if a student has any general questions or is feeling ill, it is best to just give them a call.
Anyone experiencing severe 
illness, including the inability to keep fluids down, severe dizziness or shortness of breath should seek immediate care.

Dumb, Dumb
The following is a travelogue from 
a two-week West coast tour that my band, Nobody Wave, and my 
neighborhood friends’ band, Pretend, embarked on this summer. Last week, I left you in a sick binge of Indian cui-
sine on Pacific Avenue in Santa Cruz. 
That night, the gang rolled over 
to my close friend Stephen’s place on 
Bay Street, where we’ d planned a free impromptu show for whoever cared to come. Stephen was psyched to see us and quickly procured cardboard and Christmas lights for self-promo-tion purposes. We strung the lights in a haphazard maze outside and inside the house, around the Econovan and along the “Free Show” signs we had Sharpeed with beaming stick-figure faces. A few of my friends showed up with a few of their friends, and soon we had a bona fied party. 
Tragically, the po-po were called 
after just one Pretend jam, but we had a bit of time before quiet hours, so we each finished a short set. Stephen was so impressed with his house-turned-venue that he decided to christen it the Bay St. Music Box, hoping more bands would roll through someday. We partied the rest of the night at a lower volume, gathering kumbaya-style on the hardwood floor.
Early the next morning, we col-
lected our gear and split up with Pretend, planning to meet up later on in San Francisco. We drove up to UC Santa Cruz for some authentic burritos and then went on a tide-pool beach walk before setting out for the Bay. When we got to Cal’s friend April’s apartment in Lower Haight, we decided to take our day off easy and hit up Dolores Park to lounge in the shade and sap on Slurpees. 
However, we soon got bored 
watching weirdos hula-hoop so we headed back to April’s and helped Pretend lug the gear up the three brutal flights of stairs to her place. After some local pizza and late-night deep conversations over High Life, we passed out in sleepy sardine rows.
The next day was epic. The whole 
crew wanted to see our buddy Mike’s art show downtown, so we trekked through Haight and Japantown until we got to a high-rise gallery by Union Square. We spent a good hour admir-ing Mike’s meticulous tally-line draw-ings (and other photo exhibits) before Suburban    Steez

See STARFUCKER, page 12
See IMPACT, page 11Open-ended health-care reform may be eclipsing economic woes on the political frontier, 
but the La Jolla Playhouse is doting on debt — of the marital type. In the house’s latest production, Creditors, news pundit jargon of subprime mortgaging relents to the lexicon 
of bitter spouses. Adapted by Doug Wright from August Strindberg’s original play, Creditors  
centers on a quarreling menage a trois whose simplification of marriage into a creditor-
debtor relationship lands them in divorce and suspicions of adultery. With an unapolo-
getically acerbic script, the play disembowels marriage with little hesitation.
 Set in a Swedish sea resort, the 
three-act play opens with Adolf, a 
nonplussed artist, and his pseudo-
psychiatrist Gustav (who takes on 
the Freudian persona, complete 
with circular glasses and a tweed 
vest). Uncertain of his coquettish 
wife Tekla’s fidelity and haunted 
by thoughts of her first husband, 
Adolf mopes in the doldrums and 
resigns from painting altogether. 
Feeling stuck like “a frozen 
clock, ” he looks to Gustav to 
wind him back up, but is met 
only by the shrink’s misogy-
nist sensibilities. 
Gustav warps Adolf ’s 
mentality, leading the 
troubled artist to believe that a “naked woman is an underdevel-oped boy with tits, who hemorrhages every month. ” But in the second act, Gustav’s oddly extensive knowledge of Tekla’s affairs slowly unravels, bringing to light connections between characters that weren’t immediately apparent. 
By the third act, these blurred rela-
tionships are solidified when Gustav reveals himself to be Tekla’s first hus-band, a creditor in his own right, col-lecting the dues of Tekla’s adulterous love for Adolf and her degradation of his honor.  
Loaded with dramatic irony, the 
play uses modern expletives and graphic one-liners to revamp it from

Ithe room. “Don’t go to The Econ Tutor, it is a waste of time. Last quarter, I had to fail 
thirty students” because they went to him. The students are looking away. Everyone is 
uncomfortable.
The Economics Department is attacking me again. Over time, I have learned that some 
instructors would say and do anything to discredit me, but I never thought they would go 
so low as to attack me by attacking my students. My students ask: 
“W HY DO THEY HATE  YOU SO MUCH ?”  D O THEY VIEW ME AS A THREAT ? D OES MY 
VERY EXISTENCE  PUT A SPOTLIGHT  ON THEIR  DEFICIENCIES ?  A RE THEY EMBARRASSED  
THAT  10, 20 AND EVEN 50% OF THEIR  CLASS  WILL ATTEND  MY REVIE W  SESSIONS ? 
I think at some level, the University views me as threat. They tell the legislature that they  
provide world class research and instruction. But in reality, the quality of teaching is 
very uneven. There are wonderful instructors at UCSD, but sometimes being a good 
researcher doesn’t translate into being a good instructor.  Sometimes they are too busy 
to care about teaching and their lectures are unclear, disorganized or no longer relevant.
In this environment of uneven quality and overworked teaching assistants, outside in-
structors provide a useful service. In a negative light, I serve as a safety net when the 
course instructor is lacking and the students are frustrated and lost.  But in a positive light, 
-
rial or by providing a convenient late night session for students who have to juggle their 
course load with outside jobs. Moreover, I provide a continuity of instruction to a system 
For almost ten years, I have run a review service called TheEconTutor. It started with 
private one-on-one tutorials, but as I became more popular, we transitioned into 
twelve. The following quarter, I had thirty and so we grew until we currently have over a 
thousand students.
THIS SUMMER , OVER  20 OF MY STUDENTS  WERE  CHARGED  WITH  ACADEMIC  MIS-
CONDUCT  FOR ATTENDING  ONE OF MY REVIE W  SESSIONS .
Last spring, an inexperienced instructor, Dr. Bernotas, was teaching an upper level eco-
nomics (Econ 120B) class of 200 students. He assigned a take-home exam with very 
unusual instructions. Normally, on a take home exam, students are suppose to work by 
themselves; Dr. Bernotas told his students they could work in groups of three people. Fur-
thermore, those groups of three could consult with other groups. The day he handed out 
the exam, he even told the class that “ I don’t care if you work in groups as long as you don’t 
turn in a hundred of the same thing. ” Given those instructions, the students and I felt that 
we could hold a review session for the take home exam.Weeks later, the students were charged with academic misconduct. The formal charges 
said that even though they could work in groups, their work should not have been so simi-
lar to each other, and the similarities indicated that they copied from a common source. 
Faced with an unapproachable and inept instructor, these students turned to me for help. 
These students did not copy from a common source, they were taught by me.
T If they could not answer it, then they should look at it again to see if they could 
answer it. If the students could still not answer the question, then Dr. Bernotas said they 
should ask the TA for help. If they still did not understand, then and only then, should they 
ask him for help. As one senior explains:
I have never had a professor as bad as that. I have had professors who were 
worse teachers but at least they would talk to you. This guy was completely un-
approachable. He didn’t care. That is basically it. He didn’t care. I guess he is of-
fended or he has some ego problems with students getting outside help. Maybe 
he feels that he is the professor of the class so we are supposed to go to him, but 
with the quality of instruction but the major spikes in demand occur when you have an in-
were similar in size and had inexperienced instructors. In Dr. Wang’s class, 35 students at-
tended my review session. For Dr. Bernotas’ class, I had 56.Wwith the Dean of Students for their college. Sometimes, for my students, the 
initial meeting was merely to discuss the situation, but often the Dean had a 
list of punishments that the students could accept to resolve the matter quickly or could 
reject to continue the matter through a hearing process. A student describes his meeting 
with the Dean:
She continuously stated: it has to be yes or no. Black or white. “Did you cheat or 
not?” I am a good student. I already had an A in the class and I did not need to cheat. I have never been accused on anything of this nature before. Going into 
the meeting, I was expecting that they would listen to me and we would quickly 
resolve this. Instead it was like talking to a brick wall. 
one who cheated on 120B. ” It was like I was already judged. I was trying to explain 
my situation and I could tell she wasn’t listening. “Did you cheat or not? Yes or no!” 
I said no and she said that I would have to go to a hearing and that wouldn’t take 
place for several months. I was planning to graduate in the summer and I already 
had a job lined up for me in China. I cannot wait until the end of the year. She 
kept on pressuring me to say that I cheated and she told me that she could not 
wait any longer for my answer and that she had to go to another meeting. “Did 
you cheat or do you want to wait until the end of  the year to resolve this?” I was 
thinking that I cannot wait. I felt sick to my stomach, but I said, “I guess I cheated. ”
I was just trying to be a good student. I go to TheEconTutor because it acts as a 
TA reviews, only better. We work through the problems and it really helps. I’m 
mad because I spend a lot of time on the questions before the sessions and work 
I went to TheEconTutor, then…I cheated.
Even though the Dean presented cheating as a simple yes or no question, experts in 
academic misconduct know that it is often ambiguous. As Dr. Gallant, UCSD Coordi-nator of Academic Integrity points out in her blog, faculty and administrator often 
say that the rules are common sense but she readily admits “students are swimming in a 
sea of confusion surrounding over ‘what is academic misconduct’” .   
As I work and write in the area of academic integrity, I am continually amazed at the complexity of the issue for most everyone… When we talk about student academic (mis)conduct, we need to acknowledge up front with students how unclear the situation really is.
Even though the situation is often unclear, faculty and administrators want a simple pro-
cedure to process cases. As Dr. Gallant writes:
I have a confession to make---I just realized this morning that I have been focused 
(nay, obsessed) on the number of cases that come in my door and how quickly they are being resolved…. I am enamored with routinely crunching numbers---How many cases did we have reported at this time last year? How quickly did 
we get them resolved? How many pretty graphs can I create which pictorially represent the increase in the number of cases?
And people love it! Administrators and faculty love getting this information. They 
love to see that more faculty are reporting student cheating. They love to see the 
majority of cases are resolved without formal hearings….And I love to be lov ed.
The penalties for academic misconduct are potentially quite harsh. Besides receiving 
a failing grade and having your academic record permanently crippled, you can be 
suspended or expelled from UCSD. Almost all of these students were Asian, and 
frightening; if they are suspended they lose their visa and they will be deported. Regard-
less of how slight the infraction or how dubious the charges, students are in a horrible 
life-altering situation. The students know that they are at the mercy of the administration 
and they have an enormous incentive to cooperate.  That is why,  Dr. Gallants’s observation 
that the faculty love to see that the majority of these cases are resolved without a formal 
hearing is so chilling.  Some students are not accepting their punishment and forgoing 
a hearing because they are guilty, they are forgoing a hearing because they are afraid of 
being deported.
This is not a simple case of cheating. It is not a simple case in which a student copied the answer from another student during an in-class exam or when a student went 
-
tion that they were receiving from UCSD and went to an outside instructor for help. Fifty 
six students did not go to my review session to commit misconduct. They did not sponta-
neous decide to have a cheat party. They came to me to learn.

COURSES  THIS SUMMER .”  M Y STUDENT  REPLIED , “IT IS NOT SO HARD , AFTER  ALL, I ONLY  HAVE

INSTRUCTION  AT THEECONTUTOR
One of the misperception about TheEconTutor is that we are merely a place to 
get answers. It is true that if you come to my sessions, you will get answers but you will also leave with 10 to 20 pages  worth of notes and a couple hours 
worth of instructions.
The majority of my reviews are spent working through practice problems. My answers 
tend to be long and meticulous. New students often have to pause and shake out their fingers because their hands are not used to writing so much and the older students knowingly smile at them. 
In fact, my answers will often last one or two pages when the solution in the answer 
key is only one or two sentences and this frustrates some students.  But it is through my answers that I give my lectures and introduce the key concepts that my students need to learn. So instead of giving one long lecture, I give several mini-lectures as I work through our problems. 
When we have homework sessions, we work on the              actual problems. This makes some professors anx-ious but I feel it is appropriate and it is what I did as a 
Teaching Assistant at UCSD. The point of homework is to motivate students to study the material before their exams. It introduces them to difficult material and it encourages them to seek help if they need it. While there is merit in solving difficult problems by yourself, there is also merit from having careful and experienced instruction which makes difficult problems seem less intimat-ing. This provides context so that students can see the linkages to problems that they have already solved and which can turn a solitary grind into a supportive and interactive group experience. 
I take homework very seriously because I believe that students 
cannot succeed on their exams if they do not know the material on their homework. The bottom line for any review service is that students will not return to you unless they do well on their exams. The incentives to teach your students effectively and efficiently  are very strong. If my students do not learn and do not suc-
ceed on their exams, then my business fails. 
I am fairly strict.  My students have to  sit-up straight and pay attention. They are not 
allowed to eat meals, talk to their neighbors, use their cell phones, leave before the 
session ends, and laptop use is limited to specific computer intensive projects. I need these rules in order to be productive and it is a trade-off that my students are willing to make. 
The strictness is tempered by an atmosphere of familiarity. It starts with learning their names but it really results from our high retention rates. In a typical year, a thousand students will go to TheEconTutor.  Sometimes, they only attend one or 
two classes but there is a core of about 250 students who come to us for all their class-es. These core students typically come to us during their junior year. By the time they graduate, they will have come to us for help in 10 to 15 classes, they will have attended 60 to 90 review sessions and I will have spent 120 to 180 hours teaching them. This creates the strong bonds of trust and familiarity that are at the heart of my business.
WHAT AND WHO  IS THEECONTUTOR
I have undergraduate degrees in Biology-Chemistry and Literature from Pitzer Col-lege. My senior thesis was a joint project with Los Alamos National Laboratory and was 
one of the first applications of magnetic resonance to living systems. However I soon tired of laboratory work and became active in protest movement against the Reagan Administration’s policy toward Central America. I joined a Peace Brigade and then traveled through much of Central America. The region was suffering from extreme poverty, civil war and death squads. I walked through slums and visited prison camps. This made me interested in the economic aspect of repression and I started studying economics at University of New Mexico where I received a Masters Degree and worked as an instructor teaching intermediate micro and macro economics. 
I moved to San Diego and became a graduate student at UCSD. Although I withdrew from the program before I finished my doctorate, I passed all my qualifying exams and I was one or two classes short of completing all my course work for a PhD. My 
advisor was George Borjas who is the country’s leading scholar on Immigration and who subsequently left UCSD for an endowed chair at Harvard University. At UCSD, I was a Teaching Assistant for several courses and was a research assistant for Julian Betts (the current chairman of the economics department) and Hal White (perhaps the departments most distinguished scholar). I also studied econometrics under two Nobel Laureates: Professors Engel and Granger.
In retrospect, going to UCSD was mistake. The theoretical and technical slant of the 
department was not a good fit with my humanistic concerns. My father was math-ematician and he made sure that I had the technical skill to survive and occasionally flourish, but I lacked any passion. Increasingly, I sought refuge in the Visual Arts and in particular painting.  This was especially true after my mother unexpectedly died of a brain aneurism.  However during my last year at UCSD, I rededicated myself to economics. Unfortunately, this was not because of a renewed love of the topic but because my father contracted an aggressive form of brain cancer; he requested that I complete my doctorate before he died. I worked on a project under Prof White to develop neural networks. Mainly I worked on software, but I hoped that this would be the foundation of my dissertation. In any case, the cancer worked faster than I did and 
I stopped working on the project when my father died.
THE TURNING  POINT
This started a particularly dark period in my life. But it was from that darkness that TheEconTutor emerged. I was very close to my parents and now they were both dead. I felt very alone and angry.  I felt like a failure for letting my father down. I was sick of econom-ics and the drudgery of being a research assistant. Art has always been an escape for me, so I decided to be a painter.  Although I had a few shows, I was not able to sell any of my paintings. I became poorer and poorer and soon I was homeless. At this point, I should have turned to my relatives and friends for help but I felt cut-off from the world. 
WITH  ONLY  $200 LEFT , I WENT  TO TARGET  AND BOUGHT  A TENT  AND A SLEEPING  BAG AND 
WENT  TO LIVE IN THE NATURE  RESERVE  ACROSS  FROM  RIMAC. N OW I HAD $130 LEFT  AND 
WHILE  I COULD  SHOWER  AT THE GYM  AND EAT RAMEN  NOODLES  FOR FEW DOLLARS  A DAY, I 
NEEDED  A WAY  TO EARN  SOME  INCOME .
You can always earn some money by being a subject in medical experiments, but my big break came when I saw a flyer from a student needing help in econometrics.  I still remember when that student offered me $75 to tutor her for 10 hours a week. Since my living expenses were down to $15 a week, it truly felt like I hit the mother lode. Af-ter a quarter or two, I became increasingly popular and my schedule would quickly fill-up. Eventually, as it became harder to get an appointment, students would crash the appointments of their friends and that is how I started doing group tutorials. As the groups got bigger and bigger, we moved from one location to the next until now we have a classroom for fifty students in a shopping mall across from campus. There was never any business plan except to survive the latest attempt of the Econ Department to shut us down. I knew that we had made it when an instructor called TheEconTutor a parasite in his midterm exam. Imagine, five hundred students having to intensely read about TheEconTutor during their exam. You cannot buy publicity like that!
I stayed in that forest for a year and half. The freedom from fiscal constraints gave me 
time to learn the undergraduate curriculum but mainly it gave me time to rebuild my 
soul. Tutoring, especially private tutoring is a wonderful way to fill the loneliness in 
your life.  During the hours that you spend with your students, you help them with their classes but you also help them weather the turbulence in their lives. You get to learn about their friends and family and even the names of their pets, but more than anything, you get to feel needed again. I think that is why I try to keep our rates low and why I try to help my students in all their classes.  I have an almost compulsive need to be needed and helping theses students was the way I rebuilt my life.

ALBUMREVIEWS
Even at their conception, 
Crown City Rockers never fit neatly into a 
hip-hop concept box. The band’s 2001 debut, Mission: 
One, spills over into jazz and 
even dabbles in classical as the Oakland, Calif. fivesome showcases its unique back-ground as a former student clique at the elite Berkley College of Music. 
Eight years later, the 
group’s third full-length, The Day After Forever,  breaks that 
music box wide open.
Since their popular 
sophomore Earthtones in 
2004, the Crown City mem-bers have honed their craft on solo and side projects including emcee Rashaan Ahmad’s two solo efforts in as many years. Now, they come back smarter, slicker and more versatile. Forgoing interludes and instrumentals, Ahmad gets right on first track “Soul, ” spitting over an upbeat rhythm heavy on the hats, laced with synth, saxiphone and a fluttering flute melody. 
Featured vocalists Silya 
and Solas B. Lalgee bring the Crown City jazz factor to the next level, pseudo-scatting on their respective tracks. Production takes a large leap as well; guitar dances around a melody laid by brassy synths and held by heavy bass on the intro to “Go On” — while “Break” could straight-up pass as a party-rock track. 
Listening to Forever, it’s 
clear that the quintet had no rust to shake off after the five-year vacation. Instead, they came back with new, fresh perspectives to think even further out of the box.

Three Days Grace is all grown up. Remember the days when Adam Gontier 
had the moptop and wore black coats during the One-X  
phase? All the songs about being misunderstood and losing control, bashing away at four-chord wonders in the garage? Face it — it doesn’t get more teenage than “I Hate Everything About Y ou. ”
With Life Starts Now, 
they’ve finally come off puberty, though the evi-dence is subtle on lead single “Break. ” Most of the track is just another humdrum hard-rock anthem like “Riot” — but we’re banging our heads anyway, because Barry Stock has discovered the power of palm-muting. 
Once we get to “Lost In 
Y ou, ” though, we have to stop and rub our eyes — is this Oasis? It might not be expected, but 3DG is sur-prisingly earnest on their first real grown-up love ballad. Its verses are unspec-tacular, but its chorus is built for singing along (or for “Sleepless in Seattle 2”).
Of course, the newly 
minted adults occasionally regress with mopey cuts like the ranty “Someone Who Cares, ” but mostly make up for it on the climax title track. 
Life’s a lot like One-X  
in that it ends on a hopeful note. The difference is that One-X  reeked of predestined 
success — Life’s more about 
picking up the pieces. 
Wall o‘distortion and  
honest Oasis? If Grace can keep it fresh like this, hell — we won’t mind if this former high-school favorite keeps playing into middle age.

Nu-Rock Rioters Learn to T one Shit Down
Pearl Jam churned out yet another album this summer, Nirvana’s set 
to release live material in November and Alice in Chains just dropped its first studio album since 1995. Children of the ’90s: Grow your hair out and dust off that plaid button-up, because grunge is back.
After vocalist Layne 
Stanley’s fatal heroin over-dose in 2002, AIC makes an improbable comeback with Black Gives Way to Blue . From 
a sprinkling of acoustic tracks to the snarling electric guitars, Blue  picks up right where the 
band left off. 
“Check My Brain” and “ A 
Looking in View” slide us right in, evoking alt-rock Sabbath with crunchy, dissonant riffs. DuVall includes enough of AIC’s signature growl to keep the band’s cult following sat-isfied on “Check My Brain” — and over a decade removed from grunge’s heyday, it still works. Just like Nirvana, AiC can’t help but trade electric acoustic — and damn it all if that doesn’t work, too. 
The title track (and the 
album’s coda) is AIC’s farewell to Stanley; the band sends him out bobbing gently down the river on a pillow-soft palan-quin.
Apart from scattered bouts 
of formulaic grunge, Blue  bal-
ances the old with the new almost flawlessly. And if you crank the album up loud enough and headbang from black to blue, you have the pleasure of forgetting what decade it is.

FILMREVIEW
The Truth Hurts — but ‘Lying’ Is Excruciating
By Jenna Brogan
Associate Hiatus Editor
Whether or not you proudly sport 
a “Team Jim and Pam” T-shirt, you have to admit that Ricky 
Gervais struck comedic gold when he created “The Office. ” 
Sadly, even loyal Dunder 
Mifflinites will be disappointed by the Brit’s directing debut: “The Invention of Lying, ” a comedy about what life would be like if everyone told the truth, and nothing but the truth. 
While it is an interesting idea, 
Gervais proves in a record five min-utes that a world without omission is not a place you want to be  — nor does it make for a particularly inter-esting trip to the movie theater. 
Immediately following the opening 
credits — in which we’re told exactly what is going to happen over the next 100 minutes — we meet Mark Bellison (Ricky Gervais), a sad excuse for a man. He’s broke, fat, single and about to be fired.
That description may seem a bit 
cruel. And it is. 
But “Lying” is all about exposing 
the harsh reality of how shallow, rac-ist, sexist, horny and money-hungry we all apparently are.
See, since no one in this alternate 
reality has the ability to lie, interper-sonal communication is no more than each individual’s stream of con-sciousness, out loud. 
Allow the screenplay to speak for 
itself:
When Mark picks up Anna 
(Jennifer Garner) for their first date, she admits with a straight face, “I was just masturbating. ” 
Mark then responds with a 
simple, “That makes me think of your vagina. ” 
‘Nuff said.Now, back 
to the plot.
One day, 
Mark the loser gets out of a bind by telling the world’s first lie. How he manages to do this remains a mystery, but one lie leads to another as Mark capitalizes on his newfound ability, quickly accruing fame and fortune.
Things soon get complicated, 
though, when tales concocted by Mark’s imagination are accepted by the world as gospel truth and he is treated more like Moses than Brad Pitt.
If you can stomach the fact that 
Garner, who would more likely pass for 13 than 30, plays a perverted prima donna, and Jonah Hill, who can typically be 
relied on for comic relief, portrays a suicidal Debbie downer, you might find the film to be a multi-layered satire about everything wrong with American society. 
Coincidence that it shares an 
opening day with “Capitalism: A Love Story”? I think not. Still, all the layers of social commentary about consum-erism, capitalism and morality in the world can’t hide the fact that the film is not at all funny. 
Y ou’ d think an award-winning 
screenwriter would milk this uncanny scenario for all its side-splitting worth, but instead of “Office” wit, the audi-ence is force-fed dry humor that sub-stitutes punch lines for insults that are just plain mean.
Tina Fey’s character even goes so 
far as to call Mark a “fat faggot. ” Heh.
As a result, the only thing even 
mildly brow-raising about the film is the sheer number of celebrities that Gervais evidently tricked into cameos. Really? Edward Norton? 
While standing behind that shiny 
35-millimeter camera may have made for a nice holiday from Scranton, a word from the wise to Ricky Gervais:
Don’t quit your day job.… That’s what she said.
The Invention of Lying
STARRING RICKY GERVAIS, JENNIFER GARNER & JONAH HILL 
DIRECTED BY RICKY GERVAIS & MATTHEW ROBINSON
RATED PG-13
01:40and shopping-addicted American 
family to go fully green. 
An official selection at the 2009 
Sundance Film Festival, this low-budget eye-opener intends to force viewers into questioning their own personal consumption habits and individual global impacts.
But Beaven finds out early on that 
the journey to Gore-esque nirvana has its share of not-so-obvious chal-lenges — like when he has to convince his wife of the value of trekking their daughter up 24 flights of stairs instead of taking the elevator.
The family’s compost bin quickly 
fills with rotting food, earthworms bring mating flies into their home and Colin gets bombarded with blogger criticism about whether his project will have a real impact. Fights between him and Michelle about having a sec-ond child put emotional weight on the already strenuous endeavor.
Y et in the midst of conflict, the 
film has the power to convince even the most pessimistic viewers that — at the risk of sounding cheesy — all crea-tures in the world are connected. Who knows? Maybe it is possible to reduce our negative impact, change world-views and save the planet after all. 
Unlike most biased, agenda-fueled 
documentaries, “Man” gives face time to supporters as well as critics with-out sugar-coating the motives which inspired the experiment, including Beaven’s writing career. 
But all good intentions and crafty 
camera techniques aside, the year long experiment feels more like a decade by the film’s conclusion. And let’s be hon-est: It’s no “Inconvenient Truth. ”▶ IMPACT, MYVTWHNLAl Gore Protege

the musty, 19th-century original. Vivid 
imagery in the script compensates for a static, minimalist set that reflects the play’s Victorian-era backdrop. 
Creditors  never takes itself too seri-
ously, however; just as the bombs of marital jihad are about to explode, the play invites us to hide and chuckle behind the fort of clever puns and quick wordplay it employs. 
The play’s intricate web of entwined 
love stories is cleverly muddied by confusion over the true identity of the creditor and the debtor in all three rela-tionships. 
Adolf — epileptic and invalid by 
the end of the play  — is Tekla’s credi-
tor by virtue of having sacrificed both his physical and spiritual self to please her. At the same time, however, he finds himself in debt to Tekla because she nurtured him (implicit even in her nickname for Adolf: “little brother. ”)
It is in the midst of this confusion 
that our sympathies for the characters waver, but raw performances from the three-person cast rarely falters in grounding us with its palpability. Omar Metwally offers a nuanced portrayal of the distressed Adolf  — fully in love and snared by his conflicting emotions of desperation, elation and jealousy. Kathryn Meisle, as the devilishly slut-tish Tekla, somehow evokes pity for the vilified wife as T. Rider Smith effort-lessly renders Gustav — the despicable misogynist who transforms into a prude sycophant.  
Reflecting playwright August 
Strindberg’s own marital strife, the improbable storyline manages an air of unabashed honesty. Creditors  confronts 
us with a morbid and gloomy take on marriage, suggesting that the institution imprisons, emasculates and kills.
Whether we agree with Strindberg 
or not, one thing’s for certain; Creditors 
is no Taylor Swift fairytale. 
When Adolf reveals a nude sculp-
ture of Tekla as a manifestation of his obsession in the first act, Gustav taunts him by deriding the art of sculpting as a crude way of “conveying complexity without color and nuisance. ” The play, ironically, does just that.
and a paisley-robed potbelly. Nothing is too ordinary — stretch marks, back pains, dirty boxers, toe-sucks nor dicks hard as calluses  — to earn a mention in this interlude-free stretch of bumpers to hump your old lady by.
Across the board, fans and critics 
agree that Cuban Linx… Pt. II is as masterly a sequel as we could have hoped from the Chef. Tight-wound beats are Wu-brand dungeon antique, Raekwon’s dragon flow is fire-tight — “Blood squirted, look like laundry detergent, the dread fell out/ Right f r o m  t h e r e ,  h e  g o n ’  n e e d  a  s u r g e o n ”   — as are top-form guest spots from Inspectah Deck to Beanie Sigel.But Linx’ highlights are undeniably 
the eight whopping Ghostface cameos, stanking of the same whiney, finely aged perviness that makes Emerald City so 
hot. His raps are pillared by vintage Wu but made to soar with a sense of new-age self-realization — single-handedly driving the Shaolin grandfathers into a the next century of greatness.

of groups that lace poppy dance 
music under lyrics of heartbreak. Similar to Ra Ra Riot, but with a flatter aesthetic, the trio ends up a less psychedelic, decidedly less inspired MGMT.
Serving as frontman to the mel-
low, lo-fi and all-around depress-ing band Sexton Blake — which featured song titles to the tune of “Better off Dead” and “Want to Die” — songwriter Josh Hodges became dissatisfied by the band’s lifeless concerts and created Starfucker in 2007. Joined by Ryan Bjornstad and Shawn Glassford on stage, Hodges’ live performances couldn’t be further from his Sexton days.
The stage is where Starfucker 
shines, transforming weak record-ings into robust hits. These skinny guys from Portland are weird in a great way  — although you could 
never tell it from their albums — sometimes opting to show up wardrobed by an ’80s hip-hop show (think neon bomber jackets, over-sized glasses, fresh hi-tops and fat gold chains). Band members jump rapidly between a variety of instru-ments, with Bjornstad spending a significant amount of time on the ones and twos, and replace stale samples with superior live instru-mentation.
Most importantly, the synth-
heavy tracks are known for spur-ring the entire room into an all-out, seething sweaty dance-party — appropriate for a group that got its start playing cramped house shows. The verbosely named, guitar-based “Rawnald Gregory Erickson the Second” of Target commercial semi-fame is enough to get the crowd moving, while the up-tem-po, scratch-laden “Medicine” might even get it rowdy. Performing at the Loft should work to Starfucker’s advantage; the confined space was made for a crowded, sweaty  (albeit 
snooty) experience.Sappy Fucks Go

hoofing it all the way back until we hit 
the buzz-heavy Ike’s Place for glorious sandwiches. We must’ve walked a good 10 miles that morning. When we got back to April’s, a few of us took catnaps to prep for the madness to come. 
That night, at least 70 people were 
shuffling in and out of her place, peeing on her neighbor’s back door (because the bathrooms were occupied) and crowd-surfing in her living room to our friends Koalacaust. The cops rolled up multiple times to shine Maglites in our faces, but — thankfully — the party was never shut down. An even bigger miracle: We didn’t find a single broken item the next morning.
After gathering our thoughts and 
belongings amid the alcoholic debris, we took off across the Bay Bridge to Oakland and met up with our friends Sarah, Jordan and Bones, who were residing in an art space/crack den of a house. We had time to kill, so we unloaded and then cruised to the theater to catch “District 9” — a much-needed break before the night’s festivi-ties. The Oakland show was undoubt-edly the wackiest of the tour: Sloppy kids slammed into each other, into walls, busting holes in said walls and then passing out on the carpet. Pretend roll-bounced when the madness set in, crashing back in SF at a motel. We were concerned there wouldn’t even be a clean spot for us to claim on the ground; random German friends of Sarah’s had already called the best bedroom. We even debated leaving for Portland at 2 a.m. that night and taking turns at the wheel until morning. 
In the end, we just manned up and 
got cozy with each other. When I woke up at 7 a.m. to go pee, there was a dude passed out on the linoleum kitchen floor and one in the hallway. Like so, we took off for Oregon. What would 
we find in Weed, California? Would we gang-fight local Portland band, the Hugs? What is Burgerville? Find out in next week’s thrilling conclusion.

Coyote junior forward Albert 
Cabrera scored the game’s only goal  
— his seventh of the season — to beat UCSD. 
Akman again played well as keep-
er, recording five saves — four of which came in the first half. The sec-ond half saw virtually no offense, as each goalkeeper made only one save apiece. Senior midfielder Kyle Parton was the Tritons’ lone offensive stand-out, finishing with three shots on goal. 
“Other than San Bernadino’s goal, 
the game was pretty even, ” senior midfielder Jonathan Sawyer said. “ A lot of our games tend to be low scor-ing, so winning often comes down to whichever team can finish chances. ”
Despite ending their weekend road 
trip with only one win, the Tritons improved their offense and now look t o  p l a y  s t r o n g  a s  a  t e a m  t h r o u g h o u t  the upcoming homestand.
“For the past few games our team 
motto has been ‘stick together, ’ which basically means no matter what hap-pens, we stay together as a team and work hard for each other and for the UCSD logo on our jerseys, ” senior forward Tony Choi said. “With a bit of tuning up this week, I am confident we will be fully prepared to take on one of the best teams in the nation on Friday. ”
UCSD will try to maintain their 
home winning streak on Friday, Oct. 2, where it will host No. 7 Sonoma State st a scheduled start time of 4:30 p.m. The Seawolves are undefeated this season,  with a record of 7-0-2 
overall and 4-0-1 in the CCAA. The Tritons will then host Humboldt State on Sunday, Oct. 4

Though the Cal Poly Pomona 
goalkeeper blocked her kick,  
Hernandez came up with the rebound and proceeded to rocket the ball into the back of the net. The goal was Hernandez’s third of the season.
“Her shot was perfect, ” Armstrong 
said. “It was well-placed and [made] with perfect timing. ”
Defense was critical in the Triton 
victory. With less than a minute left in the first period, the Broncos were down a goal but kept steady pressure on UCSD. Cal Poly made a strong push across the field, attempt-ing to tie the match in the closing seconds. The Broncos took a shot but Armstrong made a criti-cal save, maintaining the 1-0 Triton lead with only nine seconds left in the half.
“If the ball comes 
down to my side of the field, I have to keep everything out, ” Armstrong said. “One goal can really matter. ”
Cal Poly Pomona applied most 
of its pressure during the first half, outshooting the Tritons 11-5. Armstrong’s save  late in the first half 
appeared to have deflated the Broncos’ morale and halted their momentum: Not only did the Tritons hang on for a victory, but also controlled the tempo in the second half with an 8-2 shot advantage. Armstrong tallied a career-high eight saves to earn her first shutout as a Triton.
Head coach Brian McManus said 
he was proud of his goalkeeper’s play in the key CCAA match.
“She’s playing tremendously well, ” 
McManus said. ”She has great con-centration and so much confidence. ”
UCSD continued its winning 
ways with a 2-0 victory over Cal 
State San Bernardino two days later, on Sept. 27. Each team displayed solid defense in the first half, and no goals were made on either side. 
However, the ever-resourceful 
Tritons took advantage of two accu-rate corner-kick restarts late in the second half to defeat the Coyotes.
“When it is 0-0, the most important 
thing is to keep a clean slate and not get scored on, ” sophomore midfielder and team captain Anne Wethe said. “Our o f f e n s e  i s  s t r o n g  e n o u g h  t o  s c o r e ,  b u t  the most important thing is to keep 
them out of our net. ”
Freshman defend-
er Ellen Wilson gave UCSD the 1-0 lead in the 69th minute, when she knocked in the ball off of a corner kick from senior midfielder Alexia Zatarain. Less than six minutes later, Wethe headed a second goal off of a corner kick from sophomore Sara Bolton. For both Wilson and Wethe, the goals were their second of the sea-son.
“It was a really great 
corner from Sarah Bolton in the right place, ” Wethe said. “It was a pretty easy knock-in. ”
The Tritons outshot the Coyotes 
14-10 during the match. Armstrong had another strong performance, post-ing five saves and recording her second consecutive shutout of the season.
UCSD returns home to play 
Sonoma State on Oct. 2. The Seawolves are 4-4-2 overall and 2-2-2 in CCAA.
“We have to keep playing like we 
have been playing, ” Wethe said. “Our best is better than any other’s best. So if we can just keep our heads in the game and play hard, we will do well. ”

MEN’S SOCCER  — A cluster of tie games 
and low-scoring matches has plagued UCSD 
so far this season, due in large part to a domi-nant defense and dormant attack. However, the Tritons stepped up their offensive performance on the road last week against Cal Poly Pomona, securing a 1-0 victory on Sept. 25.  
UCSD was unable to retain Friday’s 
momentum at Cal State San Bernardino  on 
Sept. 27, losing 1-0 to the  Coyotes.  The week-
end split leaves the Tritons with an overall record of 4-2-4 (1-2-3 in California Collegiate Athletic Association).
The lone goal of Friday’s game at Cal Poly 
Pomona came in the 23rd minute, off the leg of junior midfielder Kasra Sarabakhsh, in his first season on the UCSD team. After receiving a pass from junior midfielder David Bakai, Sarabakhsh drove the ball up the left side and booted it past Cal Poly Pomona senior goalkeeper Thomas Ryan. The assist was Bakai’s third of the season;  he continues to deliver outstanding plays in the midfield. 
Despite being outshot 20-11, the Tritons 
managed to use a more balanced attack to fend off the Broncos. 
Senior goalkeeper Peter Akman was out-
standing between the posts, collecting four saves for his 17th career shutout. The Broncos applied most of the pressure in the second half, during which Akman stopped three of four shots on goal. “We were a lot sharper defensively against 
Pomona, which made the difference, ” senior forward Tony Choi said. “Our keeper, Peter Akman, made a few very difficult and crucial saves that kept us in the game to beat Pomona. Other than that, we have had problems offen-sively. We seem to be lacking a bit of energy and creativity in the offensive third, and that has been keeping us from scoring goals. ”
On Sept. 27, UCSD traveled to play Cal State 
San Bernadino in a match between the No. 3 and No. 4 teams in the CCAA. Friday’s low-scoring trend continued against Cal State San Bernardino: The Tritons and Coyotes totaled ?WUMV

WOMEN’S SOCCER  — UCSD 
recently capped a stretch of five con-
secutive road matches, with a 1-0 victory at Cal Poly Pomona on Sept. 25 and a 2-0 win at Cal State San Bernardino on Sept. 27. The two wins improved the Tritons’ record to 7-2 and 5-2 in California Collegiate Athletic Association play. 
The Tritons finished the road trip 
by winning four of five matches. The only loss on the trip was a 2-0 defeat at the hands of Chico State on Sept. 20. The loss against their CCAA rival also knocked the Tritons out of the National Soccer Coaches Association of America rankings for the first time this season.
“It’s always important to rebound 
after losses, ” sophomore goalkeeper Kristin Armstrong said. “We had more than a bit of fire built up from that loss. ”
The contest against Cal Poly 
Pomona was defined by a dominant Triton defense that — aside from shutting out the opposing Broncos — held Pomona to a mere eight shots on goal. UCSD’s one goal was enough to squeeze out a victory. 
The match was scoreless until 
the 32nd minute, when freshman forward Gabi Hernandez came through with a thrilling goal that would hold up to win the game. Hernandez skillfully fought her way through the Cal Poly defense and positioned herself in front of the net. She then received the ball from freshman midfielder Alexa

MEN’S GOLF — Heading into the Western Washington Invitational on Sept. 28,  head coach Mike Wydra  was already comfortable with his top three golfers, but didn’t know who would fill the fourth and fifth spots on the roster. 
Sophomore Michael Tilghman 
may have just earned himself one of those spots with his play at the Invitational. Tilghman totaled seven-over-par for the three rounds, earn-ing him a tie for 35th. 
As a team, UCSD finished 10th 
overall.
Tilghman was an unlikely pick 
heading into the season-opening tournament, as he had competed in only one tournament last season. 
“I felt like I had a lot to prove this 
year, ” Tilghman said. “I didn’t really play that well last year, but I put in a lot of practice and hard work during the offseason. I put a big emphasis on ball-striking, which was a big problem for me last year. ”
His improvement became appar-
ent when Tilghman hit 16 of 18 greens in the second round, en route to a one-over-par 73. Despite a career-best performance, Tilghman  believed he could have gone even lower.“I didn’t putt well all three 
rounds, ” Tilghman said. “I figured if I could hit a lot of greens, I could make a lot of birdies and a few pars, but my putting kept me from going low. I had about three to seven more putts in each round than I usually do. ”
Trouble on the greens aside, 
Tilghman’s perfor-mance left an impres-sion on Wydra. 
“We need to find the 
right players, and the right pieces at the right time, ” he said. “Keith and Raj are playing well, Richard adds a lot and it looks promising with Tilghman step-ping up. ”
But the five-man 
roster isn’t set in stone. 
Before each event, play-
ers compete to earn a spot on the final roster for the upcoming tour-nament. Wydra said the two golfers with the lowest stroke totals in practice earn an auto-matic spot alongside his three top picks.
Though the 10th-place finish was 
a disappointing start to the season, the Tritons were competing with-out junior college transfer Richard Morris, their No. 1 recruit. He had issues with the NCAA clearinghouse — a necessary step to becoming an eligible student athlete. 
“The NCAA clearinghouse wasn’t 
able to clear Richard to play in time, ” team captain and junior Keith Okasaki said. “He should be ready to 
travel to Chico in two weeks. ”
When Morris is 
able to join the lineup, he will do so behind current No. 1 and No. 2 players Okasaki and senior Raj Samra, 
respectively. Okasaki 
finished two strokes behind Tilghman, while Samra came in six strokes behind Tilghman. 
Neither player was 
happy about his tour-nament play.
“I played about as 
bad as I could have through the first two rounds, ” Okasaki said. “I just had to grind it 
out and salvage something. ”
Samra, on the other hand, was 
admittedly rusty after not competing much throughout the summer, due to problems obtaining his Southern 
California playing card.
The team was off to a shaky-start 
in its first competition of the season. While many players had practiced in individual tournaments over the summer, they weren’t able to do so in a team format. 
For the Tritons, the challenge 
became adapting from an individual to a team-oriented mindset.
“No matter what the team’s doing, 
you have to keep battling through, ” Tilghman said. “Y ou have four other guys depending on you, and you have to grind it out if you are having a bad round. In individual tourna-ments, you can get a few bogeys and get down on yourself, but you can’t do that in team golf. It’s not just you out there. ”
With some early rust shaken off, 
players will get back on the course Sept. 30, Oct. 5 and Oct. 7 to try and qualify for the tournament roster 
that will travel to the Chico State 
Invitational. 
Wydra is confident that as the 
season progresses, scores will con-tinue to improve.
“We’re in the early development 
of the year, ” Wydra said. “I expect us to have under-par totals throughout the year. We have plenty of talent. ”
