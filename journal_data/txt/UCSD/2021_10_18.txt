On Oct. 7, UC San Diego 
issued an update to current 
housing policies for the rest 
of the 2021–22 academic 
year due to the unanticipated 
success of the first phase 
of UCSD’s Return to Learn 
Program. The update issued 
by Housing Information 
at UCSD distinguished 
the difference between 
Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the 
university’s Return To Learn 
plan. 
“We continue to be 
guided by science in all of 
our decisions that impact 
the safety of our campus 
community and will reassess 
and adapt based on our 
evolving understanding  
of the science and its 
implications, ” UCSD  
Chancellor Pradeep Khosla 
said in an email statement 
on Oct. 14.
Many state colleges and 
University of California 
schools transitioned to 
remote learning during the 
previous academic year 
to avoid exacerbating the 
pandemic. The schools that 
reopened were often met with 
severe outbreaks. San Diego 
State University reopened its 
halls completely in August 
2020, but garnered 800 
positive tests from students 
within one month.
UCSD implemented a 
strategic reopening plan to 
avoid a similar fate for its 
students. UCSD held many 
classes outdoors within 
lecture tents propped up 
in Warren Mall or Roger 
Revelle College. Scientists 
from the university began 
testing wastewater for  
COVID through 52 samplers 
spread all throughout the 
campus. Lastly, masks were 
non-negotiable throughout 
the entirety of the first year 
back on-campus. 
Through such strategies, 
the university has been 
successful in navigating the 
pandemic. According to 
the UCSD COVID-19 Daily 
Dashboard, 0.14 percent of 
students have tested positive 
for COVID-19 since Sept. 
15, while 0.56 percent of 
employees have tested  
positive as of Oct. 16. 
“I am confident [in our 
success]because we are in 
community, ” UCSD Vice 
Chancellor for Student 
Affairs Alysson Satterlund 
said to KPBS concerning 
the university’s reopening. 
“Through the contributions 
of students, staff, and faculty 
who adapted based on what 
we learned from the science. ”
The plans for this year 
begin with Phase 1, which Updates to UCSD 
COVID-19 Housing 
James Stevé, a Black police officer in the 
UC San Diego division of the UC Police 
Department, filed a lawsuit against 
the UC Board of Regents and UCSD in 
response to racially-discriminatory actions he 
experienced while serving. In the complaint 
filed on July 23, Stevé claims that actions 
by the UCSD-PD and UCSD led to him 
losing financial stability and security, as well 
as suffering negative effects on his mental 
health. 
Stevé, the plaintiff of this complaint, was 
transferred from the police force at UC Santa 
Barbara in January 2014 to UCSD-PD. In an 
interview with The UCSD Guardian, Stevé’s 
lawyer, Darren Richie, stated that the lawsuit 
stemmed from systematic issues of racism, 
sexism, and homophobia within the UCSD-
PD force. 
The lawsuit alleges a number of incidents 
that Stevé faced in his time with UCSD-
PD from year-to-year. Stevé and his team 
reported that within the first three weeks of 
his employment, a captain advised UCSD-
PD to terminate Stevé because he wasn’t 
considered a good fit. 
The allegation then claims that some UCPD 
officers made derogatory comments about 
Stevé around the middle of December 2014. 
However, he was reluctant to file a complaint 
at the time due to the department’s failure to 
investigate previous complaints. 
Furthermore, the complaint states that an 
officer attempted to convince Stevé to sign a 
document that would have deducted local and 
union dues taken from Stevé’s contract, which 
Stevé refused to sign. 
Following this, in 2015, Stevé found out 
that he needed medical treatment, but was 
removed from the Systemwide Response 
Team Squad which resulted in a 5 percent 
reduction in his paycheck. The complaint 
offers no reason as to why Stevé was removed. 
The following year, Stevé claims that 
Captain Morris, another officer in the police 
department, constantly followed him while 
at work. According to Stevé, he noticed 
that there were unmarked UCSD-PD patrol 
vehicles outside of his home but was never 
notified as to the circumstances. 
Additionally, the complaint notes that in 
2018, Stevé was removed from the Field 
Training Program because of Chief Dave Rose 
and Sergeant Jones. 
“Plaintiff was suddenly removed from the 
Field Training Program not due to merit, but 
rather because of Sergeant Jones and Chief 
Rose’s personal reasons, ” the complaint states, with no further explanation of the reasons. 
Because of this removal, Stevé’s income was 
reduced by another 5 percent. 
In response to these incidents as well 
as many others, Stevé had attempted to 
file numerous complaints and visited the 
Office for the Prevention of Harassment & 
Discrimination and UCSD Labor Relations. 
However, Stevé claims the UC Office of the 
President, UCSD, and UCSD-PD have not 
investigated any of his reports.  
Stevé is suing UCSD and the UC Regents 
for four main violations: denial of First 
Amendment rights, violation of the California 
Whistleblower Protection Act, negligent 
infliction of emotional distress (NIED), and 
a violation of California Labor Code 1102.5. 
According to Stevé’s filed complaint, the 
greatest problem is that even though Stevé 
brought attention to the issues within the 
force, UCSD-PD ignored him. 
“UCSD-PD’s conduct alleged…has legally, 
proximately, foreseeably and actually caused 
[the] Plaintiff to suffer loss of financial 
stability, peace of mind and future security, 
and to suffer emotionally, physically, and 
mentally, ” the statement read.
When The Guardian reached out to 
the Associate Director of University 
Communications Leslie Sepuka in an email, 
she promised that UCSD seeks to enforce 
fairness, cooperation, and professionalism 
to have a quality working and learning 
environment.
This is not the first time a discrimination 
case has been brought against UCSD-PD. 
According to the complaint, anonymous 
officers contacted UCSD and UCOP about 
several discriminatory practices at UCSD-
PD, including homophobic comments made 
by Sergeant Melissa Luth in 2018. In June 
2020, an officer penned a letter to UCSD 
Vice Chancellor Gary Matthews detailing 
systematic racial issues along with other 
systematic problems within UCSD-PD. 
The Guardian reached out to other officers 
on the UCSD-PD force, Sheldon King and 
Arnold Moss. However, both declined to 
comment. 
Richie pointed out that there have already 
been changes thanks to Stevé’s lawsuit. 
“There were certain people in higher points 
of power that were… ultimately trickling down 
to cause these issues. Some of these bigger 
individuals have since been transitioned out, 
following this lawsuit, ” Richie said.

out to them to begin formal 
communications. He added that 
the lawsuit is still beginning. 
“ As far as litigation goes, [the 
lawsuit is] in relative infancy, ” 
Richie clarified. 
At the end of this lawsuit, 
Richie hopes that Stevé receives 
justice, but also that there 
are systematic changes to the 
UCSD system.
“It’s multi-layered. I definitely 
want my client … to see change 
obviously to his benefit, ” Richie 
said. “ And for him to be the 
catalyst that ultimately changes 
the dynamics plaguing these 
UC schools. ” 
The lawsuit remains in its 
early stages and there is no 
further information available. 
The Guardian will continue to 
monitor the case and provide 
updates when possible.  commences at the beginning 
of each quarter and after 
each of the holiday breaks. 
During Phase 1, all students 
are required to wear face 
masks within their apartment 
or dormitories with the 
exceptions of personal 
bedrooms or showers.  
COVID-19 testing is done 
upon arrival as well as day 
five and ten after. 
Phase 1 will continue 
until Phase 2 is announced 
by the Executive Director 
of Housing Dining  
Hospitality, Hemlata Jhaveri. 
Additionally, UCSD will be 
returning to a Phase 1 period 
at the start of each quarter 
and after Thanksgiving, 
Winter, and Spring breaks. 
Masking in the common 
residential areas of all units will be mandatory once 
again.
Once Phase 2 is entered, all 
students will be permitted to 
take off their mask within 
their residential quarters. 
However, students are  
mandated to wear masks in 
building lounges and shared 
facilities to prevent the 
spread of COVID-19.
The policies differ for 
vaccinated and unvaccinated 
individuals on-campus.  
UCSD announced on Oct. 
15 that mandatory, weekly 
testing for asymptomatic, 
fully-vaccinated individuals 
is no longer required. 
Unvaccinated individuals 
must continue to get tested 
twice a week.
Testing vending machines 
are available within every 
college on-campus in  
addition to Price Center. For 
time-efficient test results, 
students are advised to 
submit their sample before 
officials pick up samples at 
2 p.m. every day of the week.
In addition to COVID-19 
safety measures, UCSD will 
be conducting a campus-wide 
Simulated Emergency Drill 
at 7 a.m., Thursday, Oct. 21. 
Students are asked to lock all 
doors following emergency-
drill procedures during the 
30-minute sequence and will 
be permitted to return to 
their dorms by 7:30 a.m.

Increase in Student Enrollment the Cause of  Campus Wi-Fi Troubles
 Since the beginning of Fall 
Quarter 2021, students and 
faculty on campus have reported 
experiencing issues connecting 
to UC San Diego campus Wi-Fi. 
The cause of this has been the 
campus’ centralized internet 
infrastructure being unable 
to support the large increase 
in usage due to high student 
enrollment. 
In response to an inquiry sent 
to The UCSD Guardian regarding 
student and faculty concerns, the 
Information Technology Service 
(ITS) Desk Group provided the 
following information. 
James Seddon, the associated 
director of network and voice 
operations in ITS Desk Group, 
explained that the authentication 
system was not ready for such 
an immediate and large increase 
of account users. In the first few 
weeks of the quarter, students 
may find it harder than usual 
to log into the UCSD Protected 
Wi-Fi.
“Some readers may not realize 
that running Wi-Fi for a large 
campus like this is very different 
than running Wi-Fi in your house 
primarily because of the vast 
geographic area that’s covered: 
400 buildings and a couple of 
thousand acres, ” Seddon said. 
“ And the number of users that 
are using it, you know, we’ve seen 
peak concurrent usage of 67,000 
people using the Wi-Fi all at the 
same time. ”
According to Seddon, 
unlike home Wi-Fi, a special, centralized infrastructure was set 
up in order to meet the internet 
needs of an entire campus. Due 
to a component complication, 
the entire campus has had poorer 
Wi-Fi quality. 
“Tens of thousands of users 
all get up and move exactly the 
same time — basically the class-
changing time, ” Seddon said. 
“ And as those users are moving 
around campus, their tablets and 
laptops often try to automatically 
connect to the network. Those 
devices have to authenticate 
log into the wireless network at 
each building they pass. [Then] 
our authentication system was 
getting overloaded, and it would 
take a long time to recover from 
t h a t .”
Seddon also mentioned 
UCSD’s intentions to mend 
the issue through a new 
authentication system, which, 
if successful, should have an 
invisible transition process. 
We’re also going to conduct a 
redesign of our authentication 
infrastructure from scratch, to 
try to utilize the lessons learned 
this fall. ” Seddon said, “Over the 
next few years, you can see the 
construction that’s going on on 
c a m p u s .”
A number of students have 
expressed that these connectivity 
issues affect their daily routines. 
Unable to connect her tablet 
to campus Wi-Fi, Katherine 
McGraw, a junior at Eleanor 
Roosevelt College, goes to the 
Sun God Computer Lounge in 
order to access stable internet. 
“I cannot get on either Guest 
or Protected [Wi-Fi] right now, ” 
McGraw said in an interview with The Guardian. “That’s why 
I am taking paper notes instead 
of computer notes. Though I 
usually go to the Lounge between 
classes, definitely I do have to 
go out of my way to get there, 
instead of just stopping where I 
want with my laptop. I’ve been 
doing so [since the] beginning 
[of] this academic year. ” 
Yijun Wang, a biochemistry 
sophomore at ERC, reported that 
she could not access a stable 
internet connection in her 
Pepper Canyon campus housing. 
“I have to turn on my mobile 
hotspot to do my homework, ” 
Wang said. “I tried the UCSD 
Protected and the UCSD Guest, 
but neither of them is fast 
enough. I can barely watch the 
lecture videos and play computer 
games. ”
Wang further mentioned 
that there was a day where the 
Analytics Writing Program 
instructor had to conduct 
their lecture orally, without 
PowerPoint presentations, 
because of the inaccessibility of 
the Wi-Fi at lecture halls. 
These issues have also 
frustrated UCSD faculty such as 
Jennifer Carr, a UCSD professor 
in the philosophy department. In 
an interview with The Guardian, 
Carr stated that a lot of times 
she can barely connect to UCSD 
Protected in her new office at the 
Ridge Walk Building. For her, 
Mondays are particularly difficult 
when it comes to securing a 
steady Wi-Fi connection.
Seddon pointed out that the 
previously installed system 
worked well up until Summer 
2020. The system was designed for the usage level the ITS 
anticipated seeing. 
“We knew that [outgrowing 
account] was going to be a 
problem, so we acquired a 
best-in-class industry-standard 
enterprise-level authentication 
system from a major vendor and 
installed it in the summer of 
2020, ” Seddon said. “When we 
set that up, we designed it for the 
usage levels that we anticipated 
seeing this fall, for a fully-
populated canvas. ”
Despite these upgrades, 
Seddon said that the number of 
users outpaced expectations.  “Unfortunately, it’s just 
impossible to test a fully-loaded 
campus on a system like that, ” 
Seddon added. 
If internet connectivity issues 
persist, please refer to the 
Campus Wi-Fi Status Page for 
more tips or IT Help Desk FAQ. 
In addition, please report any 
Wi-Fi problems to the service 
desk, either by submitting a 
request via the Service Portal, 
email, phone call at (858) 246-
4357, or walking into the Applied 
Physics & Mathematics Building

Raymond Tran
My political action started 
with protests. I had exclusively 
attended protests to ask for 
action. I marched on issues 
ranging from personal ones 
such as the Pink Tax to ones 
affecting my allies such as the 
broken criminal justice system. 
Our numbers would often 
provoke at least some action, 
with political figures trying 
to secure upcoming elections, 
but our grievances were rarely 
addressed unequivocally . 
Through no fault of  our own, 
we remained locked out of 
the decisions that our leaders 
claimed were made thinking of 
us. Seeking more clarity on the 
interpretations of  the people’s 
desires, I joined organizations 
and worked internships 
that increased my access to 
representatives.
Now my positioning within 
the system allows me to talk 
to these decision-makers 
more directly . I even get to 
interact with people like those 
in the Democratic National 
Committee who regularly call 
themselves “allies of  people,” 
like myself. But here I have America’s government is 
a business. I have gone from 
being its customer to being a 
worker within its bureaucratic 
structure. I have seen the 
transactional relationship from 
both sides. 
Yet somehow, I do not feel 
like I am able to do more. 
Sometimes a title or position 
behind my name forces 
power-wielders to look up as 
I speak but, overall, I remain 
as unheard as before. As a 
consumer, I learned that the 
masses’ numbers and voices 
mean little to those representing 
us. As a worker, I learned that 
leaders will pretend to care 
but actually want me to stop 
working. Or more accurately , 
to stop doing the jobs they 
claimed they wanted me to 
do; to stop listening to the 
people. Invariably , when a 
cohort of  workers’ efforts are 
undermined, the rage turns 
inward rather than at the 
power structures consistently 
suffocating us.seen that their desires go 
beyond the people’s vote. 
It’s 
about 
what’s 
in it 
for 
them.  
Senators Joe Machin (D-WV) 
and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) 
are testaments to this failing 
method of  withholding political 
power. Regardless of  whether 
legislation on their docket is for clean energy , COVID-19 
stimulus checks, or affordable 
healthcare, the senators never 
vote to give the people what 
they need. The combined 
1.4 million voters who took a 
chance on them mean nothing 
when millions of  dollars of  Big 
Pharma and Big Oil money are 
flowing into the senators’ back 
pockets. Our relationship with 
political leaders is far from a 
wholesome one of  the public 
with their public servants. 
Every move by our leaders 
is transactional. Since these 
transactions put funding over 
addressing peoples’ plights, 
those with the biggest checks 
assert the greatest influence. 
Before, I only had enough 
access to see that my vote 
was meaningless after the 
election. But now, when 
I voice the concerns of  the 
AAPI community , the student 
population, the LGBTQ+ 
and BIPOC communities 
at-large in spaces exclusive to 
figureheads and the people 
who work with and for them, I 
see that statistics and personal 
grief  stand little chance. I am the face of  these constituents, 
yet I often come back to them 
with none of  their needs met. 
As a student politician, I 
naively thought I would have 
a seat at the table. But the 
government, like any other 
profiting entity , feels no urge to 
listen to their workers. Where 
companies have at least some 
responsibility to customers, the 
government has long lost any 
desire to earn its constituents’ 
votes, our votes.  
As citizens, we pay them. 
As interns and employees, we 
work for them. Instead of  using 
the resources we provide to 
write policy that ensures the 
health of  the public, they use it 
to diminish the importance of 
feeding us. They starve us
As a constituent-turned-
worker navigating the political 
bureaucracy , I can tell you that 
our leaders and my bosses are 
deaf  to our pleas.
When our country is facing 
a labor shortage, when people 
are dying, when histories of 
oppression are being erased, 
we can’t have millionaire public 
servants saying that they “don’t 
have an urgency” to spend the 
money that the people give the 
government to help them in 
times of  need. It is time for the 
government to stop swindling 
its people in an effort to profit 
off  of  us. Help is Not on its Way 
Our leaders are not listening.

OPINION  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , OCTOBER 18, 2021 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 5
Disconnecting to Reconnect
“Get off your phone” is a phrase 
that is frequently thrown in the 
face of younger generations. The 
sheer commonality of these four 
words makes the automatic eye 
roll or shrug laden with irritation 
an understandable response. It was 
not too long ago that this was 
my own programmed reaction. 
However, as frustrating as it is to 
hear, I have grown to understand 
that everyone should heed this 
healthy reminder. In this digital 
age, it is easy to mindlessly scroll 
on your phone. It is easy to keep 
your head down and bury your attention in an endless amount of 
digital content because all it takes 
is the swipe of a finger, a tap of a 
screen, a press of some buttons to 
get lost in the automated world of 
social media and instant messaging. 
But, it is important to remember 
the feeling of isolation that arises 
from constant phone usage. This 
self-imposed loneliness can easily 
devolve into poor emotional 
well-being, since genuine human 
connection cannot be replicated on 
a mobile device — regardless of its 
social capabilities.
The correlation between 
loneliness and smartphone 
usage is not a newly discovered 
phenomenon. For years, various 
studies have been conducted on this relationship and they tend 
to arrive at the same conclusion: 
frequent smartphone usage is 
significantly linked to loneliness, 
depression, and anxiety. This is 
especially common in young adults 
in the United States who spend an 
average of seven hours a day on 
their phones. Overall, smartphones 
tend to be a breeding ground for 
emotional turmoil.   
However, the argument is slightly 
more nuanced than it seems. 
In recent years, smartphones 
are now advertised as valuable 
communication resources. Apps 
like Discord, Skype, Snapchat, and 
Instagram all feature a relatively 
strong network of connectivity 
that can supposedly promote social behaviors and foster a 
digital form of kinship. Over the 
course of quarantine, these digital 
forms of communication grew in 
popularity. The majority of social 
interactions moved to a digital 
setting due to the limitation and 
absence of in-person socialization. 
However, these supposed digital 
“connections” did very little to limit 
feelings of loneliness and isolation, 
especially in young adults. Despite 
smartphones providing a form of 
communication during quarantine, 
loneliness among teenagers 
skyrocketed, leading me to believe 
that smartphones only serve to 
create the illusion of connectivity. 
It is not uncommon to see 
young adults utilize their phones 
for social media, texting, or general 
communication with others. While 
this may seem like a reasonable 
excuse to allow the incessant use of technology because it promotes 
sociability, digital interactions 
do not hold the same impact as 
in-person connection. It is easy to 
fall into relying on these handheld 
devices because of the ease at which 
they are available. But, the reality is, 
when you use your phone, you 
are often still physically alone with 
only the digital ghost of a friend 
or family member, which is not 
nearly as rewarding as an authentic 
presence. Despite the belief that 
in-person interactions are more 
difficult or taxing to initiate, they 
simply begin with a “hello” and can 
continue on for however long or 
short you would like.  
Furthermore, face-to-face 
socialization has been proven 
to have a variety of benefits. 
Emotionally, it produces dopamine 
which results in a positive 
emotional state and an increase 
in motivation. Oxytocin levels 
are also proven to raise and 
subsequently reduce stress levels. 
Mentally, improvement in memory 
abilities and the reduction of 
neurodegenerative diseases has 
also been noted. 
Luckily, the method to unlocking 
all these potential health benefits 
can be quite effortless. It is as simple 
as looking up from your screen and 
engaging with the world and the 
people around you. When you are 
waiting for your lecture to begin, 
try starting a simple conversation 
with the person next to you. When 
you get on an elevator, resist the 
temptation to pull out your phone 
to cover the awkward silence and 
instead try engaging with the other 
person. When you walk to class, 
take your headphones off and 
introduce yourself to someone new. 
It is simple moments like these that 
lead to rewarding interactions and 
improve your overall well-being.

Film Review: “No Time to Die”
Daniel Craig returns as James Bond in “No Time to Die,” giving fans an action-
packed adventure as he says a final goodbye to the role that’ s defined his career. 
If there was one film in Hollywood that suffered from the col -
lateral damage that came as a result of COVID-19, it was Dan -
iel Craig’s last venture as James Bond in Cary Joji Fukunaga’s 
film “No Time to Die.” The film’s initial release date was set 
for April 2020 and is only now seeing theaters over a year later.
“No Time to Die” follows Bond after the events of the previ -
ous film “Spectre.” Having left the queen’s service to be with 
Bond’s lover Madeleine Swan (Léa Seydoux), he is pulled back 
into duty when his and Madeleine’s past catches up with them. 
Long-time Bond fans will recognize some staples of the fran -
chise. His iconic Aston Martin makes its entrance in the open -
ing action sequence accessorized with guns, bombs and other 
fancy features. The opening action scene is filled with adrena -
line-fueled scenes including motorcycles and car chases. It sets 
the stage for the film as the action packed blockbuster it prom -
ises to be and it does not disappoint. The rest of the movie has 
amazing set pieces filled with memorable moments. For exam -
ple, Bond fights his way up a staircase in a one-shot that keeps 
you in the moment the entire time. The seamless edits that hide 
the cuts immerse you in the gritty brutal fight and build tension 
with each minute that passes. In true spy fashion they spend a 
lot of time criss-crossing across the globe to places like Jamai -
ca— a nod to Ian Fleming, the author of the James Bond books, 
who owned property in Jamaica. 
One of the best action scenes takes place in Cuba when Bond 
is partnered with fresh faced Paloma (Ana de Armas). de Ar -
mas’ performance is a breath of fresh air, despite her short-lived 
part. Her chemistry with Craig from the critically acclaimed 
film “Knives Out” definitely carried over to this project. The 
return of Jeffrey Wright’s Felix Leiter was also a welcome ad -
dition along with other returning characters such as M (Ralph 
Fiennes), Moneypenny (Naomi Harris), and our favorite quar -Image courtesy of ScreenRant.
termaster, Q (Ben Whishaw). With a large cast of both new and 
familiar faces, it seems like it would be very hard to fit every -
one in. However, as we learned from ensemble cast films like 
“Ocean’s 11” and “Avengers: Endgame”, nothing is impossible 
and Fukunaga and Co. do, in fact, make it work. 
New to the franchise, along with Paloma, is the newly instated 
agent 007 Nomi (Natasha Lynch). Nomi is introduced as a sup -
porting character and a new agent but she shows early on she is 
very capable at her job, and at times, might be even better than 
Bond. Even though her insistence on having Bond know she is 
the new 007 might get old after a while, it fuels the antagonistic 
partnership between her and Bond, which makes for funny ban -
ter and a friendly rivalry. Although it is unclear what direction 
the Bond franchise will be heading in now that Craig is fin -
ished, it would be great to see Nomi as the new 007 as it would 
bring a different take on the iconic role. While the protagonists 
and side characters were a blast to watch, I unfortunately can 
not say the same about “No Time to Die”’s antagonist Lyutsifer 
Safin (Rami Malek). Casting Rami Malek as this titular villain 
seemed to be the only interesting part about the character. De -
spite the fact that he shows up in the very first scene and has 
a major part in Swan’s past, he is very underused. Not only is 
he not given nearly enough screen time, but his motivations for 
wanting to kill half the world (via complicated blood related 
nanobots) does not carry any weight. Safin seems to be follow -
ing the trend of underused Bond villains following Christoph 
Waltz’s Blofeld in “Spectre,” who also appears in this film and 
is again, underutilized. 
Despite its shortcomings, “No Time to Die” was an exhilarat -
ing, fun, and action packed blockbuster that finally got to see 
the light of day. Craig, Fukunaga and Universal put their all 
into Craig’s last venture as James Bond. Craig’s performance 
was not only great, but felt like he genuinely enjoyed making 
it. His performance sends fans off with what I think is a heart-
tugging and fitting farewell.

COLUMN: “THAT 
FUNNY FEELING”
Indie folk phenomenon Phoebe Bridgers re -
turns to the indie-pop scene with her new single 
“That Funny Feeling.” The track — a cover of 
Bo Burnham’s parodic comedy song — channels 
Bridgers’ prowess as both a melancholic vocalist 
and frequenter of the internet. The stripped-down 
production highlights Bridgers’ infamous feathery 
vocals, further solidifying her role as the harbin -
ger of sad girl fall. While it may seem like an odd 
choice, Bridgers’ decision to cover “That Funny 
Feeling” fits well within the realm of her tradi -
tionally downcast discography. The song, despite 
its memability and affiliation with Burnham’s sa -
tiric persona, addresses themes sprinkled through -
out Bridgers’ most recent album, “Punisher.” 
Hidden within the song’s verbal play on culturally 
relevant entities (“Carpool Karaoke, Steve Aoki, 
Logan Paul”) are veiled references to the modern 
state of anxiety and isolation experienced by indie 
singers and comedic geniuses alike. Although they 
occupy vastly different niches of internet culture, 
both Bridgers and Burnham appear united in their 
general hopelessness and despair.
Cynics might regard Bridgers’ decision to align 
herself with Burnham as an eschewing of her 
always-serious, perpetually-depressed persona, 
but “That Funny Feeling’s” success on the Bill -
board charts entails much more than just a mu -
sical reinvention: proceeds from the track will 
benefit Texas abortion funds following governor 
Greg Abbott’s decision to sign restricitve abortion 
legislation into law. In a recent live performance 
of “That Funny Feeling,” Bridgers introduces the 
song, saying simply, “This one’s for Greg Abbott.” 
For many women, the recent attacks on abortion 
rights signify their own kind of apocalyptic col -
lapse. As an artist whose musical ventures often 
address the end of the world, Bridgers’ investment 
in the abortion rights movement comes as no sur -
prise. “That Funny Feeling” is just another mani -
festation of Bridgers’ existential nihilism.Scan Here to

Release Date:  October 4, 2021The Austin City Limits (ACL) fes -
tival  was full of highs and lows this 
year. It is the first time the festival 
has been allowed to come back due 
to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it 
boasted an impressive lineup of art -
ists including Billie Eilish, Machine 
Gun Kelly, Doja Cat, and Erykah 
Badu.
Among them was Grammy-nomi -
nated soloist Phoebe Bridgers, who 
had her sound cut early during her 
set on Saturday, prompting an apol -
ogy from the organizers and a sub -
sequent donation to Texas Abortion 
Funds.
Phoebe Bridgers performed during 
the second weekend of this year’s 
ACL Festival but was cut off as she 
was performing her closing song “I 
Know the End.” A video captured 
by a festival-goer displays an erup -
tion of boos from the crowd follow -
ing her sound being cut. Regardless, 
Bridgers and her band continued the 
song. After the set, Bridgers re -
marked in a since-deleted tweet, “lol 
f--- acl.” 
Following the events, ACL or -Phoebe Bridgers’ Set 
Cut Short
ganizers delivered a statement on 
Monday through Austin American-
Statesman apologizing to Bridgers 
and explaining why her sound was 
cut in the first place.
It was initially reported that Bridg -
ers had been cut off due to her set 
extending over her allotted time that 
day. However, the organizers cited a 
“miscommunication” between ACL 
personnel as the reason why the set 
was cut prematurely.
Along with their apology, the or -
ganizers made a donation to Texas 
Abortion Funds, an organization 
Bridgers recently endorsed with a 
cover of Bo Burnham’s “That Funny 
Feeling.”
"Unfortunately, due to a miscom -
munication on stage by ACL Fes -
tival personnel, the sound on the 
final song of (the) Phoebe Bridgers 
set was cut off during her ACL Fest 
weekend two performance. We wish 
this had not happened and extend our 
apologies to Phoebe. After positive 
conversations between festival orga -
nizers and the artist about the situa -
tion, ACL Fest has made a donation 
to Texas Abortion Funds to show our 
support for Phoebe and an organiza -
tion close to her heart." 
In response, Bridgers said on Twit -

PRISCILA ANNE PUNO AND BRADLEY BEGGS
Ask Bradley
The sound of my shoes hitting the linoleum floor 
marked my presence in the museum, though many 
were too enthralled by the artwork to notice my 
footsteps. I make my way up the stairs towards the 
European Renaissance section, hoping to see my 
favorite painting before I continue my day. It is 
here in this museum where I have spent most of 
my days in the last week, for the curators acquired 
such a beautiful piece, that I felt it calling to me the 
moment I heard it was here. But today, something 
strange captured my attention. Instead of the regu -
lar passers-by and an empty bench in the middle 
of the floor, a young man sat on that very bench, 
staring at the painting I had recently been entranced 
by. I waited for a moment to see if he would move. 
Maybe he was simply more interested in this piece 
than others. It was, in my opinion, the best piece 
here. But after minutes of an unwavering gaze, I 
realized he was there to stay. Deciding not to let 
this unusual circumstance take away from my en -
joyment, I sat next to this young man, who was still 
staring at the piece ahead of us. 
And after a prolonged amount of silence, he fi -
nally spoke up.
“It’s a beautiful piece, isn’t it?”
I sat with this question for a while.
“It is,” is all I gave him. I did not come today to engage in petty conversation.
“I find it funny,” he says. And in my head, I am 
taken aback. Funny? I see no humor in the artistry 
before us. But, perhaps I understood him wrong — 
it was not the first time I had misheard someone.
“Really?” I ask. “How so?”
“Do you know who is in the picture?” 
I found this question peculiar. Of course, I knew 
who was in the painting. It was Patroclus with a 
grief-stricken Achilles by his side. 
I respond with, “I do. Do you?”
“No.”
“No?”
“No. I have no idea”
Dumbfounded, I inquire further.
“Tell me then, why have you sat in front of this 
painting for so long?”  
“It reminds me of another piece of art of Orpheus and Eurydice. Their bodies are the same. The 
grief and sorrow on their faces mimic each 
other, yet they differ in their relationship. 
These are two Greek warriors, not like the 
Roman lovers. So, why does this man share 
the same emotion for the other?”
I ponder this question, then carefully re -
spond, “He loved him just as a mother loves 
their child, just as a son admires his father, 
and just as a wife loves his husband. In many 
ways, the Greeks and Romans are the same. 
Similar gods, the same ideas, the same sto -
ries.”
Pointing to the man on the right, I speak 
again. “Achilles loved Patroclus, just as Or -
pheus loved Eurydice.”By Bradley Briggs

NELSON  ESPINAL FEATURES  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , OCTOBER 18, 2021 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 9
 On Oct. 12, the Federal Drug 
Administration (FDA) announced 
the first vape authorized for mass 
marketing and distribution in the 
United States. 
In a press release, the federal 
agency declared they “granted 
orders to R.J. Reynolds (RJR) Vapor 
Company for its Vuse Solo closed 
ENDS device and accompanying 
tobacco-flavored e-liquid pods.”
The authorization comes after 
several vape companies handed 
over samples to the FDA for testing 
and potential regulation. Only the 
Vuse product from the Reynolds 
Company met the requirements 
that the FDA demanded.
Not all of  the flavors were 
approved — only the nicotine flavor 
which lacks the other additives that 
provide an extra taste. 
The main reason for approving 
the product is the potential 
assistance it can provide for people 
who are addicted to nicotine 
products. Other alternatives like 
nicotine gum do not provide the 
same physiological connection of  
inhaling and exhaling. 
“Today’s authorizations are an 
important step toward ensuring all 
new tobacco products undergo the 
FDA ’s robust, scientific premarket 
evaluation,” Mitch Zeller, J.D., 
director of  the FDA ’s Center for 
Tobacco Products, said in the press 
release. “The manufacturer’s data 
The FDA Exhales a Vape Approval 
demonstrates its tobacco-flavored 
products could benefit addicted 
adult smokers who switch to these 
products — either completely 
or with a significant reduction 
in cigarette consumption — by 
reducing their exposure to harmful 
chemicals.”
The Vuse vape is available at 
various gas stations, smoke shops, 
and other convenience stores. 
Their large availability plays an 
important role in the Reynolds 
Company’s overall success. 
Like many traditional vapes, 
the Vuse has a refillable cartridge 
that relies on a liquid, commonly 
referred to as “juice,” to provide 
the inhalable vapor. This liquid 
is found in replaceable pods. The 
device features a battery that allows 
for greater portability as well. 
The three flavors offered by 
the company are menthol, golden 
tobacco, and rich tobacco. The 
pods are placed magnetically into 
the device. All of  the flavors offer 
a contrast from the fruity flavors 
other companies use to market 
towards  younger audiences. 
Currently , Vuse owns 33 
percent of  the market share while 
Juul owns 40 percent. With a shift 
towards flavorless pods, the market 
share that Vuse acquired without 
appealing to a younger audience 
played a role in the product 
becoming authorized. 
“For these products, the FDA 
determined that the potential 
benefit to smokers who switch 
completely or significantly reduce 
their cigarette use, would outweigh the risk to youth, provided the 
applicant follows post-marketing 
requirements aimed at reducing 
youth exposure and access to the 
products,” the FDA stated in a 
press release. 
While the FDA felt the device 
would not lead to the youth 
gravitating towards the Vuse 
product, certain health experts 
are concerned with the adverse 
consequences of  authorizing a 
vape product. 
Ryan Barrlett of  Utah’s 
Department of  Health, felt as if  a 
“green light” was given to people 
to consume and use vape products. 
Young adults, one group of  concern 
for the FDA, may misinterpret the 
authorization. 
“When it comes to e-cigarettes, 
we’re most concerned about youth, 
people who are in high school, 
middle school and even into the 
young adult range,” Bartlett said 
to Deseret News. “Because that’s 
the age where if  you start using 
this, there’s a fairly good chance 
you’re going to use for the rest of  
your life.”
Apart from the confusion 
caused by the authorization, the 
Vuse device is only authorized 
for people who are attempting to 
quit smoking, not someone who 
is starting to vape. There is still 
the likelihood that a person who 
uses Vuse will emerge addicted 
to nicotine and could then start 
smoking cigarettes. 
Eric Lindlom, a former official 
at the FDA, mentioned the specific 
use for the device is the only one tolerated. Any other uses pose risk 
for the user.
“The only way Vuse [products] 
could be used to reduce health 
harms relating to tobacco are if  
smokers switch entirely or near-
completely from smoking to using 
the Vuse e-cigarette instead,” Eric 
Lindblom, a former official at 
FDA ’s Center for Tobacco Products 
who is now a senior scholar at 
the Georgetown University Law 
Center, wrote in an email to 
POLITICO. “ Any other use will 
increase the health harms and risks 
to the users.”
Compliance with the FDA 
requires multiple checks on 
a product to make sure it 
is consistently meeting the 
requirements. For the Vuse device, 
the amount of  aerosols the device 
produces is the key aspect. As long 
as the amount is low enough to 
warrant the use for addicts, the 
regulation could continue. 
“These products were found 
to meet this standard because, 
among several key considerations, 
the agency determined that study 
participants who used only the 
authorized products were exposed 
to fewer harmful and potentially 
harmful constituents (HPHCs) 
from aerosols compared to users 
of  combusted cigarettes,” the FDA 
stated in their press release. 
Going forward, the FDA still 
needs to rule on other companies’ 
products. The decision on Juul 
products was delayed with a ruling 
that should be executed within the 
near future. With the FDA establishing that 
youth deterrence is a priority , they 
stated more actions are still needed 
to fully regulate vaping. After 
several products were ruled to be 
removed for marketing and sales, 
other potential actions loomed on 
the horizon. 
Jody Sindelar, in the New 
England Journal of  Medicine, 
addressed one of  the potential 
actions which may follow regulation 
rulings: taxation. 
With taxes rising on cigarettes 
to make them more expensive 
than vapes, nicotine addicts could 
transition to vaping rather than 
smoking cigarettes. 
Also, if  taxes are high enough, 
the high price of  vaping could 
result in fewer young people 
becoming inclined to spend so 
much money . The next regulation 
could be higher taxes along with 
banning flavored vapes. 
Young people could end up 
being deterred from even starting 
to vape with a higher entry cost 
and less attractive flavors. 
The future of  vaping regulation 
remains up in the air, and multiple 
avenues can develop according to 
how many more devices are FDA 
approved.
Depending on how the market 
develops, other actions like 
Dr. Sindelar proposed could be 
instituted as a means of  achieving 
youth deterrence. As more research 
is done, increasingly strict or loose 
regulation could be coming soon. After years of debate, research, and data accumulation, the FDA 
finally approved a vape for commercial use. With the debate 
continuing, children are becoming the new battlefield.

10/23 THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , OCTOBER 18, 2021| WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 12
Coming off  of  some great 
performances, the UC San Diego 
women’s volleyball team (6–12, 
3–4 Big West) lost a tough match to 
California State University , Long 
Beach. (9–9, 3–4 Big West). In 
their second-ever matchup, UCSD 
hoped to ring in the Division I era 
of  women’s volleyball with their 
first ever victory over CSULB , but fell short in a competitive 
performance. These two talented 
teams seemed evenly matched 
throughout the game, which 
CSULB won three sets to one, 
but experience favored CSULB, 
giving them the advantage and 
the victory .
In the first set, UCSD was 
having early troubles with passing, 
especially off  serves, and had to 
call timeout upon going down 6–9. 
UCSD kept it close, though, and 
took advantage of  a few miscues from the opposition to force a 
timeout as the set neared the finish 
line, knotting the set at 19. Out of  
the timeout, junior libero Naya 
Dong got a great dig, setting up 
a kill from senior outside hitter 
Emily Hubbard down the middle 
to put the Tritons up 1.
UCSD showed their resilience 
with a kill from sophomore 
outside hitter Ava McInnes, but 
they dropped the first set by a 
tally of  25–22. UCSD came out 
in the second set with more of  a flare, after gaining confidence 
from the close comeback. As she 
often does, senior opposite Trinity 
Castañeda started off  fast, getting 
the opening block followed by a 
kill to open up a 2–0 lead. Senior 
setter Isabela Dobra, who took 
over at the setter position in this 
second set, calmed the team down 
and got the offense working well. 
Her set to McInnes tied the game 
at 5, but UCSD’s passing miscues 
off  of  big serves continue to keep 
the team out of  rhythm.
This second set was a very 
entertaining one, with lots of  
back and forth action displaying 
the parity between these teams. 
Freshman middle blocker Emily 
McDaniel was starting to shine in 
what would be a career night for 
her, as she converted a kill on a 
great set from Dobra, narrowing 
the CSULB lead to 16–15. 
McDaniel soon followed that with 
her seventh kill, and a great rally 
ending with a kill from freshman 
middle blocker Juliette Bokor gave 
the Tritons the 19–17 lead. Both 
teams kept it close, but a powerful 
McInnes kill put CSULB on the 
brink and forced a timeout, as 
UCSD went up 23–21.
2 points later, UCSD appeared 
to win the set with a dump from 
Dobra, but a timely challenge 
from CSULB overturned the 
point. With UCSD up 24–23, the 
two teams engaged in a great rally , 
but eventually the Tritons forced 
an error from the Sharksand took 
the very competitive set.
In a crucial set 3, Castañeda 
again started the scoring for the 
Tritons. The crowd could feel 
the momentum shift as UCSD 
was great by the net, with Dobra 
and McDaniel scoring off  of  consecutive blocks to force a 
timeout and put the Tritons up 
7–3. While the Tritons looked to 
take a decisive advantage, CSULB 
kept the game in arms’ reach and 
took the lead. McDaniel got her 
10th kill, and another kill soon 
after tied the game at 18. Despite 
McDaniel’s dominance, however, 
UCSD struggled to return some 
powerful CSULB serves and lost 
the set 25–21.
Relinquishing the lead in set 
three only gave the Tritons a 
greater sense of  urgency , as the 
team again started very strong to go 
up 6–0. But just as in the prior set, 
CSULB stayed calm in the face of  
adversity , and clawed its way back 
into the game; CSULBwould go 
on to take a 16–13 lead, with all 
the momentum of  the match on 
their side. Despite showing great 
effort, UCSD could not take the 
momentum back, losing the set 
25–19, and the match, 3–1. 
The match was a tough loss 
for the Tritons, as they lost early 
leads in each of  the last two 
sets. In a well-rounded UCSD 
performance, McDaniel led the 
way with a career-high 16 kills 
on great efficiency . The CSULB 
power hitters and serves gave 
Tritons fits, and although UCSD 
started hot in multiple sets, 
the team struggled to contain 
CSULB’s offense.
The Tritons’ next game will 
be at California Polytechnic State 
University San Luis Obispo on 
Friday Oct. 22 at 7 p.m., where the 
Tritons will look to keep gaining 
experience in this inaugural Big 
West campaign.Women’s Volleyball Loses in a Competitive 
Battle with Long Beach State

On Monday, Oct. 11, Las Vegas 
Raiders Head Coach Jon Gruden 
resigned from his position with 
the team after multiple media 
outlets reported on misogynistic, 
homophobic, and transphobic 
comments that Gruden made in 
emails with other NFL coaches 
and executives. If you follow 
sports news, you’re likely aware 
of this.
But what might have not made 
the headlines is that Gruden’s 
conduct is simply a second-order 
effect of a deeper, darker culture 
of misogyny, misuse of power, and 
inadequate accountability within 
the world’s most valuable sporting 
league.
Gruden’s emails were only 
publicized as the result of an 
investigation into the Washington 
Football Team (whose former 
name was a racial slur), and 
the team’s persistent history of 
harassment and mistreatment 
of female employees. The stories 
coming out of Washington are 
horrible —  almost too horrible 
to repeat.
There’s the purposely-lewd 
version of cheerleader photoshoot 
footage kept by team employees. 
The time cheerleaders took a trip 
to Costa Rica, had their passports 
taken, and were chosen as escorts 
by male sponsors of the team. The 
glass staircase female employees 
warned each other not to use, 
because male employees could 
look up their skirts from below.
The stories out of Washington 
are as dreadful as any other case 
of corporate sexual harassment in the country. So with a mountain 
of evidence and testimony lining 
up against the Football Team, why 
is any of this being treated as 
a story about one man making 
problematic comments?
This is, of course, not to say 
that Gruden is innocent in any 
way. Gruden’s comments — 
some as recent as 2018 — are 
reprehensible. But Gruden’s most 
distasteful conduct is directly 
linked to the Football Team’s 
culture of harassment — the coach 
had circulated topless photos of 
Washington cheerleaders, with 
former Washington Executive 
Bruce Allen.
While many will be quick to 
defend him from being branded 
a capital-H Homophobe or 
capital-M Misogynist, the truth 
is that nobody in the Raiders 
organization can trust that what 
Gruden says is what he thinks, 
especially but not limited to female, 
gay, and minority employees and 
players. And that lack of trust 
extends, to some degree, to other 
NFL executives and coaches.
It even stretches to reporters: 
another revealed email shows 
ESPN’s Adam Schefter, perhaps 
the league’s foremost reporter, 
sending a finished draft of an 
article to Bruce Allen and allowing 
him to make revisions. (Y es, 
that Bruce Allen, the one who 
circulated revealing pictures of his 
team’s cheerleaders.)
For many fans, a veil has 
finally been pulled from their eyes 
that indeed, this really is what 
the league is like behind closed 
doors. With that in mind, and 
with so many of the issues at play 
here clearly permeating multiple 
NFL teams, it’s certainly odd that Gruden is the one man who has 
faced strict public scrutiny for his 
actions.
On Friday, it went from odd 
to impossible to believe, as the 
Associated Press reported that 
no other personnel aside from 
Gruden were flagged for their 
conduct among a trove of 650,000 
emails. If anything, it seems that 
Gruden taking the fall occurred 
not because he is the only guilty 
party in the league, but rather 
that he is a Jenga piece that the 
NFL can afford to remove without 
the entire system collapsing in on 
itself.
It’s easy to have a coach leave 
a team and convince the public 
that the problem is isolated to one 
bad actor; it’s orders of magnitude 
harder to really begin to chip away at the rot in the league that these 
scandals have brought to light. 
The real story, the one that far 
surpasses the scale of Gruden’s 
indiscretion, defies easy headlines, 
would take years to investigate, 
and would have no easy solutions.
Y et the accountability and 
massive overhaul that teams like 
Washington badly need might 
never come. While the NFL might 
want to appear now as if it takes 
a hard line against misconduct 
within teams, the truth is that the 
league office exists to promote the 
interests of the owners, whose 32 
teams have a combined valuation 
of over $110 billion. It’s unlikely 
that that push would come from 
fans either — this story, just like all 
of the previous revelations about 
Washington’s misconduct, will fall prey to the inevitable churn of the 
year-round NFL media cycle, and 
just as many people will tune in 
on Sundays.
One man who’s had his name 
come up more than a few times 
this week is Raiders defensive 
lineman Carl Nassib. Nassib, who 
this June became the first active 
NFL player to come out as gay, will 
likely have to face media questions 
and discussion about his former 
coach’s homophobic comments. 
Nassib, of course, has nothing to 
answer for. But his workplace, the 
NFL, does. If Nassib, or any other 
player for that matter, is expected 
to trust their coaches or front 
office, the league has a long way 
to go to re-establish the credibility 
that it has squandered in droves 
over the past decade.By  Praveen Nair
