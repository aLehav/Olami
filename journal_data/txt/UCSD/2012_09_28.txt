Need a silent, focused atmosphere in order to pump out that 
final paper? Though it is indeed a precious resource, don’t go 
to Geisel Library to study — during midterms and finals, the first 
floor is hot, loud and absolutely packed, and the quieter upper levels are usually just as cramped. Instead, cross the proverbial 
tracks and head to the medical school’s Biomed Library. Even 
when it’s crammed with caffeine-wired grad students, you can still hear a pin drop (and yourself think). Ah, sweet silence at last.OPEN 24 HRS

Due to massive state budget cuts, UCSD students have suffered the 
loss of four valued libraries (and subsequent study spots) in the last 
few years. Luckily, we still have decent weather and a huge campus 
loaded with all sorts of DIY work stations for those studious shut-ins clinging to sanity. Finish that essay at the glider port picnic tables. 
pack a lunch and stake out a spot on the lawns near Sun God. Hit 
the Old Student Center for laid-back vibes, or grab a shady table in the price Center plaza. Campus is your nerdy, sleep-deprived 
oyster. Have at it.

$12-$20 To some, Porter’s is the poor man’s Loft. 
To others, it’s the epitome of college 
weekends. The Pub is loud, friendly and bursting at the seams 
with booze and conversation. In addition to the occasional 
indie or electronic artist, the Pub typically features surprisingly high-profile hip-hop and rap acts (hence the steeper price). It’s also much more popular with San Diego’s general public — a great place to rage and mingle with some intoxicated non-UCSD folk. Sadly, many shows are strictly 21 and up. oFFoN { ART&MUSICART&MUSIC 18 19

At night, price Center’s Zanzibar Cafe turns into one of the 
more clean, trendy and high-budget venues on campus. 
The Loft’s interior is roomy and ultra-modern, and there’s 
a well-stocked bar in the back. Lately the Loft has booked mostly electronic and singer-songwriter acts, as well as film 
screenings, comedy shows, a recurring open-mic night and 
a number of other various performances.

— providing cheap, 
all-ages shows by local and underground artists 
since 1980. The venue is 
small, hand-painted and home to some of the best

MANDEVILLE CENTER WEST
While many students will only set foot in the UAG if their G.E. 
art classes are offering extra credit for doing so, those who live and breathe art will appreciate the fine gallery UCSD has conveniently stuck on the end of Mandeville Center. 
The UAG was founded in 1966 and has since honed in on 
modern art, with a specific focus on the international and the interdisciplinary. FREESTUART ART

No, your eyes do not deceive you. There is indeed 
a quaint blue cottage perched precariously atop the 
Jacob’s School of Engineering Building. You can even 
take the elevator to the top floor and step inside for a 
gravity-defying visit. This piece, entitled “Fallen Star” by 
artist Do-Ho Suh, is part of UCSD’s signature Stuart Art 
Collection. Though often a target for student negativity, 
the collection exhibits work from some of contemporary 
art’s most important figures — from Bruce Nauman to 
John Baldessari — giving campus a unique ambiance fit 
for its forward-thinking identity.EXPLORE

In the shadows of UCSD’s science and research claim-to-fame 
lies one of the nation’s leading theater programs, as well as the 
world-famous La Jolla playhouse (where many Broadway hits found 
their humble beginnings). In the center of the theater district, hidden in some postmodern architectural cube, is Wolfgang puck’s 
delicious Jai restaurant. If you aren’t rolling in cash, however, take 
a stroll around the playhouse to William Wegman’s La Jolla v ista

Despite the glaring fact that we have a giant eucalyptus 
grove blanketing the entire northeastern corner of our 
campus, many students will never even set foot on the 
beautiful miles of walking/mountain biking trails that wind 
in and around the so-called RIMAC Woods. But if you’re in 
the mood for a relaxing nature stroll, a challenging athletic 
course or some midnight star gazing, no other place on 
campus even comes close.  25oLD STUDENT  
CENTER
The Old Student Center is probably most known for being one 
of the only spots at UCSD that actually resembles a college 
campus. There’s a pub, a dirt-cheap general store (the best place 
on campus to buy testing materials and much more), a record 
store, a food co-op, a 
book co-op, the KSDT 
radio station and the Guardian newspaper 
offices, all in one cozy 
little quad. If you’re looking for a place to 
procrastinate, the

LA J oLLA
IF you aren’t up for an exhaustingly 
long bus ride, there’s enough just 
down the hill in luxurious downtown La Jolla to keep you occupied for an afternoon, or even a few hours between classes. While the city’s opulence may be slightly inconvenient for the average student on a budget, it does provide some spectacular sights — many free of charge. The 
MUSEUM  
OF CONTEMPORARY  ART rarely 
disappoints, with an ever-rotating collection of renowned art from modern artists both local and worldwide (free for students 25 and under). Among the city’s luxury clothing outlets are some relatively cheap eats — from 
SMASH  BURGER  and the delicious 
DON  CARLOS  to the quaint and 
popular LIVING  ROOM  and PANNIKIN  coffee shops. For 
a breathtaking sunset, walk down BLACK ’S BEACH , one of 
the country’s largest nude beaches, and head up the cliffs to the 
GLIDER  PORT  — a remarkable secret (not so secret 
on weekends) study and relaxation spot that’s just a breezy five-minute walk from campus.  39

area directly surrounding campus hasn’t 
much in the way of nightlife, it does offer practically all of your basic amenities within walking distance from campus — a relief for students unwilling to participate in UCSD’s notoriously heinous parking system. The nearby 
LA JOLLA V ILLAGE Sq UARE  
boasts two grocery stores ( RALPHS  
and TRADER  JOE’S), a BEST B UY, a 
STAPLES , an AMC MOVIE  THEATRE  
and a number of cheap food alternatives including 
CHIPOTLE , PICK U P STIX, 
DAPHNE ’S GREEK  CAFE , CALIFORNIA  
PIzzA KITCHEN  and STARBUCKS . 
Further inland is the UTC M ALL , home 
of ICE TOWN  ice skating rink, a farmer’s 
market every Thursday and a  host of other various shops and restaurants. Is 
your veganism making it difficult to find good food? Head to Clairemont for 
SPROUT’ S organic groceries or the delicious 
SIPz FUSION V EGETARIAN C AFE on Clairemont Mesa 
Boulevard. (free mango tea if you pay with cash). And for those on a quest for the perfect carne asada fries, search no further than

and the delightful PAPA  LUNA ’S EMPANADAS  to the simple and delicious LA PLAYA T ACO S HOP  on Mission (not to 
mention the closest IN-N-O UT to campus). During the day Garnet becomes a hub for thrift and music shopping. The side-by-
side GOODWILL  and UNITED  CEREBRAL  PALSY  thrift stores can’t be beat, while THRIFT  TRADER  has a solid collection 
of both used clothes and vinyl. But if music is your obsession, hit COW M USIC  for a fine selection of records old and new, and 
a three-hour conversation with one of the more interesting store clerks you’re likely to meet. 
LA JOLLA  doesn’t look 
much like a college town, and 
that’s because it isn’t. Those 
searching for late-night food, 
cheap clothes and a bout of 
bar-hopping tend to head 
further south. p acific Beach is 
a charmingly grungy shopping 
and bar district home to many 
third- and fourth-year UCSD 
students. Most of the city’s 
drunken debauchery takes place 
on Garnet Street — there’s 
CABO  CANTINA  (cheap), the 
TAP  ROOM  (sports), the RE D 
VELVET  LOUNGE  (hookah) and 
at least a dozen other decent pit 
stops for an intoxicated Saturday 
night. Conveniently, p B also has 
some of this city’s great eateries 
as well, from WORLD  CURRY   43
and the delightful PAPA  LUNA ’S EMPANADAS  to the simple and delicious LA PLAYA T ACO S HOP  on Mission (not to 
mention the closest IN-N-O UT to campus). During the day Garnet becomes a hub for thrift and music shopping. The side-by-

If you seek a colorful escape, head 
southeast to HILLCREST  and 
NORTH  PARK  — the two adjacent 
neighborhoods that comprise 
San Diego’s LGBT-friendly fashion 
district and its up-and-coming 
arts district respectively. PACIFIC  Beach’s thrift stores out of passable styles? It’s time to 
take the extra trek to Hillcrest’s popular 5th Avenue. In addition 
to a plethora of excellent restaurants (breakfast at the SNOO zE 
AM E ATERY  is a must) and arguably the best art-house movie 
theater in San Diego ( HILLCREST  LANDMARK ), this small strip 
is home to the best of the city’s second and first-hand clothing. From the cheap (
BUFFALO  EXCHANGE  and retro superstore 
FLASHBACKS ), to the moderately-priced ( URBAN  OUTFITTERS  
and AMERICAN  APPAREL  around the corner), 5th Avenue has 
got you covered. If your artistic gratification comes in the form of dusty vinyl, check out 
RECORD  CITY  on 6th and THIRSTY  
MOON  just around the corner.
With its affordable housing and string of respectable galleries (check out 
ART P RODUCE  on University), North p ark has 
earned the reputation of San Diego’s ragtag arts district. 30th street is home to more than a few popular bars and clubs, from 
BAR PINK  COCKTAIL  LOUNGE  to the aptly named AI R 
CONDITIONED  night club. Recently, if you were under 21 and 
wanted to catch a show, San Diego was cruel and patronizing place; now, the 
IRENIC  on p olk offers cheap and tasteful live 
acts for all ages. And where there is art, there is inevitably coffee. Head to 
FILTER  COFFEE  HOUSE  (open until 3 a.m. 
on Fridays and Saturdays), or make a stop in Normal Heights for the fabled 24-hour caffeine haven that is 
LESTAT ’S. Art, 
conversation and comfortable seating abound.

IF you’re 21, downtown San Diego’s GASLAMP  
DISTRICT  is a boozed jubilee of bars, restaurants, 
clubs and music venues (the CASBAH  on Kettner is 
a classic). If you’re a minor, however, you’re going to 
have to do a bit more searching. The historic BA L B OA 
PARK  is one of the best ways to kill a lazy Sunday — 
with 17 great museums (bring your ID for a student discount), an organ pavilion, a botanical garden, several beautiful picnic-worthy parks and the world-famous

excessive glory, and the somewhat quieter SE A P O R T 
VILLAGE  is the perfect place to take a moonlit 
harbor-side stroll before a fancy wine-and-dine with 
a date. If you’re a sports fan, why not catch a p adres 
game at PETCO  PARK . Tickets are a reasonable 
eight bucks, and public transit drops you off right at the stadium gates. Sticking around for summer? Be sure to score tickets to the monolithic
