SURF REPORTBy Gloria lin
Contributing Writer
The Jewish and pro-Israel com-
munities at UC campuses are protest-
ing recent actions taken by the UC 
Student Association, an alliance of UC students collaborating to provide a voice for the UC student body. After the California State Assembly’s decision to pass HR 35, a non-bind-ing resolution that restricts anti-Semitism and anti-Israel hate speech across state campuses, UCSA passed 
a resolution of its own condemning 
HR 35 for restricting free speech.
The Jewish community, dissat-
isfied with the methods by which UCSA came to its conclusions, claims that it was not given a voice in UCSA ’s decision. 
“One would expect that the Jewish 
community would have been given 
the open opportunity to weigh in on 
such a resolution, ” A.S. Campus-wide Senator Brad Segal said. “Or that there would have been a public, safe and inclusive dialogue about some-thing as sensitive as anti-Semitism on UC campuses. ”
According to A.S. VP External 
Affairs Olamide Noah, UCSA recog-
nizes the importance of representing 
students as fairly as possible. 
“In order to maintain each student 
agency, we [bear] the onus of protect-ing the opportunity of all students, ” she said. “When our non-student elected representatives are making strides to limit the right to expression of any group on our campuses, no 
matter their positionality in this mul-
ticulturalist setting, we stand as the representatives elected by our student bodies, whom we interact with every day to impede such efforts. ”
But from Segal’s perspective, the 
UCSA did not succeed in represent-ing the opinions of all students. “Very few Jewish students were approached 
about the resolution, ” he said. “CSA 
claimed that the resolution spoke on behalf of ‘actual victims of anti-Semitism, ’ despite the fact that the passage of the resolution was a shock to almost every Jewish student in the UC system. ”

minded elected UC student officials

Artists DJ Chris Cutz, XV , and 
The M Machine will be per -
forming at the second annual 
Hullabaloo Fall Festival, hosted by A.S. Concerts & Events. The carni-
val will be held on Friday, Nov. 16, 
from 8 p.m. to midnight, and is free for undergraduate students. It will feature a variety of entertainment, games and food, as well as the newly released lineup of live music perfor -
mances. This year’s expected atten-dance is 5,000 to 6,000 students, a significant increase from the 3,000 
students who attended last year. 
Last year, ASCE teamed up with 
members of the UCSD Founders’ 
Celebration to create Hullabaloo, after its predecessor, FallFest, was dismantled due to budget cuts. This year, Hullabaloo will be on the sec-ond day of the annual Founders’ Celebration, and both ASCE and 
members of Founders’ Celebration 
encourage students to attend. To promote this partnership, Founders’ Celebration is hosting a “We Inspire” video contest; winners will receive $200 to The Loft, two tickets to Wiz Khalifa’s concert on Nov. 14, and an opportunity to showcase their vid-eos at Hullabaloo.  
“Founders’ Celebration has aptly 
selected this year’s theme as ‘We Inspire, ’” ASCE Festivals Director Andrea Hsueh wrote in an email. “Consequently, this year, our festi-vals team has chosen the tagline, ‘We Eat. We Play. We Dance, ’ to express how our students choose to celebrate the inspiration we derive from cam-pus. Hullabaloo is about an entire experience. ” 
ASCE acquired the funding to 
host Hullabaloo through under -
graduate student fees and various 
sponsorships; after reallocating 
funds within the department, ASCE increased its festival budget from last year’s $62,500 to $65,000 this year. 
Hullabaloo will take place at Town 
Square and Matthews Quad and will host a range of activity booths and amusement rides. The activity 
booths will be manned by student 
organizations and will feature games and activities such as face paint-ing, arts and crafts, fortune telling and mini basketball. Organizations have until Friday, Oct. 26, to sub-mit their activity booth applica-tions.   Amusement rides include the “Zipper, ” a Ferris wheel with free-flipping cars, the “Kamikaze, ” a pendulum ride, “Human Bowling, ” and the “Bungee Run. ” Hullabaloo 
will also feature four San Diego food 
trucks: Super Q, The Dog Shack, Flippin’ Pizza and Devilicious. 
“The success of Hullabaloo relies 
largely upon student input, par -
ticularly when it comes to activity booths, ” Hsueh said. “Last year, we were really impressed with the qual-ity of our booths, and it was a great 
way to have students actively con-
tribute to the festival. ”  
Attendees can expect a bal-
anced lineup of musical guests at Hullabaloo, a contrast to last year’s performances that centered on elec-tronic music. Hip-hop DJ Chris Cutz and hip-hop rapper XV will open 
for The M Machine, an electronic 
music trio who has performed at both the Electric Daisy Carnival and the Global Dance Festival and has opened for Empire of the Sun, Miike Snow and Pretty Lights.
“My team and I have been 
working since last May to ensure there is something for everyone at 
Hullabaloo, ” Hsueh said. “ And as 
we draw nearer toward Nov. 16, I cannot wait to see how our efforts p a y  o f f .”

Geisel Library to Re -
open ‘24/5’

Contributing Writer
Geisel Library will be open 24 
hours a day on weekdays, starting 
Oct. 28, due in part to a sizable dona-tion from the Alice G. Marquis Living Trust. The expanded hours will begin with a grand opening at midnight on Oct. 28.
This “24/5” space known as the 
Study Commonswill be located on the first and second floors in Geisel 
Library’s East Wing, with seating for 
over 500 students. It will be open for the entire academic year. 
“Having a 24-hour study com-
mons open during the academic year has long been at the top of students’ wish lists, ” University Librarian Brian Schottlaender said. “We also realized having this space open around the clock would help to compensate for the loss of other study space on cam-pus due to previous library consolida-tions. ”
The Alice G. Marquis Living Trust, 
named for the writer and UCSD alum-na who passed away in 2009, donat-ed $1.1 million to Geisel, the larg-est single donation for the library to date.  The contribution follows almost $3 million in library budget cuts in the previous fiscal year, which resulted in the closure of four major librar -
ies, including International Relations

Breast-fed Babies Have Lower Risk of  Contracting HIV
By racHel  Uda 
Senior Staff Writer
UCSD immunology research-
ers, working with contributors from 
around the United States and Zambia, 
published a study Aug. 15 that sheds further light on the advantages of breast-feeding.
The study, published in the 
American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found a compound active in breast milk that protects against HIV spread-ing from mother to infant. It was found 
that a higher concentration of the com-
pound in breast milk correlates with lower rates of transmission.
The compound — human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) — is a car -
bohydrate that, once ingested, resides in the infant’s intestinal tract. HMO is thought to help culture important bacteria in the intestine, and it has also shown anti-inflammatory properties 
that may bolster immune response.
The group initiated the study to 
determine why only 10 to 15 percent of 
infants feeding from infected mothers were contracting the virus.“In developing countries, HIV-
infected mothers are faced with the decision of whether or not to breast-feed their babies, ” Laura Bode, assis-tant professor in UCSD’s Department 
of Pediatrics, said. “Breast-feeding 
exposes the baby to the virus and increases the risk of the baby dying from the HIV infection, but not breast-feeding increases the risk for the baby to die from other intestinal or respira-tory infections. ”
In a longitudinal study, researchers 
collected 200 samples of breast milk 
from HIV-infected mothers through-
out Lusaka, the capital city of Zambia, and then followed the women and children for 24 months.  
The researchers concluded that 
further research into HMO might be effective in an effort to develop a better defense against HIV contraction.

planning a charity drive, spirit run, council competition, know-your-rights campaign and overseeing first year council, among many other things.

Muir Senator Andrew Buselt 
introduced his plan for an AVP Environmental and Social Justice Affairs position, which caused an almost excruciatingly long debate among councilmembers.
“The argument [is] that other 
things already deal with this, so let’s just not, just doesn’t sit right with me, ” said AVP Diversity Affairs Elizabeth Garcia . “I mean, there are already 
other organizations on campus that deal with diversity, so why am I here?”
The councilmembers who 
opposed the creation of this position were reluctant to approve the new 
office because there would have to be 
a constitutional amendment in order to facilitate its creation.
It ultimately passed with a 23-0-4 
vote, with most of the opposition in abstention.

d9song@ucsd.eduBusinessLibrary Consolidation Complementing New ‘24/5’ Hours
& Pacific Studies Library and Center for Library & Instructional Computing Services or CLICS. The collections of each of these libraries are currently being consolidated into Geisel. 
The downsizing was the result of 
the $60 million total that UCSD faced in budget cuts in the 2011–12 school year. The Guardian  reported in January 
on student response to CLICS closing. 
The library closures sparked the 
“Occupy CLICS” movement, involving approximately 50 students who reclaimed the library as a study center following its closure at the end of the 2010–11 academic year. 
Closing CLICS saved the university 
$450,000 according to The Guardian ’s 
Jan. 8 article, “CLICS to be Study Space After Break-in. ”Geisel had previously been open 
until midnight on weekdays, with 24-hour access during Week 10 and finals. Schottlaender hopes that the new times will provide students who 
like to study late at night or early in 
the morning with a secure study space on campus. Overnight areas will be limited to UC students and staff, who will need to show identification before entering. 
“The 24-hour area sounds nice, ” 
Emmy Y oung, a freshman studying at Geisel, said. “It seems like a good opportunity for us to have more space. ” 
Schottlaender estimates that first 
year costs will total $200,000, with staffing and custodial costs at $117,000.

UC Student Association Defends its Condemnation of  HR 35 
UCSA resolution process. He wants 
to condemn not HR 35 itself, but the method by which it was passed. “I don’t think free speech should be limited, ” he said. “But if UCSA claims 
to represent UC students, they can’t 
marginalize a large portion of the stu-dent body and still expect to be seen as a credible organization. ”
UCSA says its decision to con-
demn HR 35 stems what it perceives to be its foreseeable consequences, not from the contents of the resolu-tion itself. 
The resolution “explicitly impli-
cates UC and CSU students who cri-tique other nations as we do our own as fit to reprimand due to fostering critical dialogues, ” Noah said.   “It is a resistance against this attack on the internationalism of the UC and CSU student. ”
“No one should be limited to what they can or can’t say; it’s our first amendment right, ”  UCSA presi-dent and UCSD undergrad Raquel Morales said. “[UCSA is] here to represent the best interests of stu-dents and they should develop their own ideals. We want them to come 
up with their own ideas. It’s not up 
to us to decide what’s hate speech and what’s criticism of foreign policy; we’re just here to protect their right to speak. ”
For UCSA to reevaluate their 
position, the issue must go through its entire board of directors for reanalysis.
“It’s important for us to hear what 
the other side has to say, as we repre-sent the best interests of students. We 
welcome any and all feedback, and 
encourage students to get engaged with their officers, ” Morales said.
In the meantime, the Union of 
Jewish Students at UCSD is work-ing to demand change in UCSA ’s decision-making process. 
“We realize that some [UC] con-
stituents agree that there is a prob-
lem with HR 35 in that it goes too 
far, but at the same time, the UCSA process needs to be transparent, ” UJS President Harrison Gill said. “It needs to go on through public meetings and more participation needs to be possible for the UCSD student body and the student bodies at other UCs. ”

In spring 2008, thousands of high school students 
were rejected from their first choice universities. These students mourned, sulked and then ended up 
at different colleges. Some ended up loving their second 
choice alma maters, some transferred. And one, Abigail 
Fisher of Sugar Land, Texas, decided that she was rejected 
for being white (in truth, she was rejected because for bad grades) and then decided to sue. 
Since last Wednesday, the Supreme Court has been 
hearing arguments for Fisher vs. University of Texas, the “affirmative action” case that could completely outlaw race as a factor for admissions consideration within the UT system. While the result will not affect the California public universities — which cannot operate 
under affirmative action, as per 1996’s Prop. 209 — the 
ruling will alter the debate around the mission of public universities and the importance of diversity on college campuses. 
As UC Student Regent Jonathan Stein noted, the 
University of California was cited in the Supreme Court’s 2003 Grutter v. Bollinger case — which outlawed race-based quotas, but allowed race to be considered as part of a holistic admissions process in the interest of 
reaching a “critical mass” of campus diversity — as an 
example of a system trying to maintain racial diversity without affirmative action. If the Supreme Court was looking to the UC system for an example of the diversity magic bullet, Stein said, the lesson from the UC system’s plummeting minority enrollment rates is that there is no such solution. The discussion isn’t over either: As recently as last spring, the U.S. 9
th Circuit Court tossed 
out another attempt to appeal the proposition. 
Student Regent-designate Cinthia Flores called the 
results of Prop. 209 “devastating” for diversity, and the numbers back her up: The number of black, Latino 
and American Indian California residents admitted to 
UC Berkeley between 1995 and 1998 dropped by 58 percent under 209 and at UCLA, 53 percent. Judges who still hope for a magic bullet, take note.  In this instance, Fisher, who ended up attending Louisiana State University at Baton Rouge, maintains that attending this lesser school has affected her long-term success. 
“It is critical in Texas to be a UT graduate, ” her lawyer 
said. “She can’t have that back. ” 
This may be true, but many can argue that it is 
critical in the United States to be an Ivy League grad, to be white, to be male and to come from a wealthy family. Fisher can’t have her UT diploma and some of us will never have these other privileges that would make our lives easier. Ultimately, it is more important to level the playing field and maintain diversity in high education, an important stepping stone, than it is for Fisher — a legacy Editorials by major newspapers and TV journalists have often echoed the claim that the 
Republican Party is anti-science. After all, these are the ones who oppose 
tackling global warming and teaching 
of evolution in schools. On the other hand, liberals have their own share of anti-science quacks — most notably regarding genetically engineered crops and the false link between vaccines and autism.
The California Democratic Party 
recently endorsed Proposition 37, 
which requires all genetically engi-
neered foods to be labeled except for specific products like meat and dairy. While a label is typically seen 
as a warning of something wrong, 
the National Academy of Sciences, the World Health Organization, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture all agree that genetically modified crops 
are not more dangerous than organic 
ones. Y et, if this proposition passes, we may expect higher food prices once companies decide to change their ingredients to more expensive organic ones. If genetically engineered food is a problem, one can buy USDA organic or continue to shop at more expensive grocery stores like Whole 
Foods or Trader Joe’s.
Many prominent liberals have also 
falsely espoused a link between vac-
cines and autism. This list includes Robert Kennedy Jr., Jim Carey, Bill Maher and Jenny McCarthy. The con-troversy stems from a paper published by Lancet  in 1998 claiming MMR vac-
cines could cause autism. Not only has 
the paper been retracted by Lancet , 
but the lead author of the study has 
been found guilty of professional misconduct and can no longer prac-tice as a doctor. This negligence has a high cost on society. For example, San Diego suffered a measles outbreak in 2008, costing $10,736 per case. This could be attributed to the doubled  
rate of unvaccinated children since 
1990.
Another policy some liberals 
oppose is nuclear power. Greenpeace continues to vehemently oppose the expansion of nuclear power plants despite its ability to reduce carbon emissions compared to other energy choices. They overstate the risks and 
use deceitful science to explain that 
accidents like Chernobyl will be the norm if nuclear power becomes wide-spread. Nevertheless, President Barack Obama and many Democratic politi-cians do support nuclear power.
It may seem like I am setting 
up an equivalence where both par -
ties have an equal amount of anti-
science hacks, but the truth is that 
the Republican Party has far more of them. Only 36 percent of registered Republicans believe that global warm-ing is mainly caused by human activi-ties compared to 65 percent of regis-tered Democrats. Ignorance of science like this has real effects on human lives so it is important we continue to 
scold politicians for their mishandling 
of facts for ideological purposes.One student’s lawsuit against the University of  Texas demands the abolition of  affirmative 
action — but with diversity at stake, now is not the time to toss aside this procedure.

Politics 
as Usual
saad asad
sasad@ucsd.edu
The candidates engaged in back-
and-forth accusations, called each 
other liars and even dealt with an apparently “major” scandal.
No, not those candidates. The 
two San Diego mayoral candidates — Congressman Bob Filner and San Diego City Councilman Carl DeMaio — duked it out last Saturday in the Price Center East Ballroom in front of a surprisingly small crowd of around 75 people. Don’t let the small crowd fool you — the debate between the candidates for mayor of America’s 
eighth largest city had an unprec-
edented amount of excitement, jabs, name calling and what became known as “Coin-TossGate. ”
First the latter: Though the debate 
— hosted by San Diego 6 — should have started at 3 p.m., the podium remained only half-full at 3:10. DeMaio informed the crowd that Filner was off-
stage arguing with organizers about the 
results of the coin toss which put the congressman in the highly unfortunate position of having to go second in the debate.
“Please come on out, Bob, ” DeMaio 
called. “We should let the public hear from both of us. ”
And as Filner finally ascended the 
stage, so began an hour-long volley of he-said-he-said. (Quite literally — both candidates used third person to describe their adversaries at various points throughout the debate.)
There was DeMaio’s repeated use of 
the word reform, which Filner claimed meant “Real Estate FOR Manchester, ” 
referring to the Republican’s plans to 
allow Doug Manchester, owner of U-T San Diego (which recently acquired the North County Times) to develop prop-erty in downtown. This led to DeMaio’s unsubtle and repetitive name drop-ping of “San Diego’s top Democrat” Qualcomm founder, Irwin Jacobs, as a big supporter of the DeMaio campaign.
Best of all was Filner’s response to 
DeMaio’s voting record of rejecting four consecutive budgets while on City Council: “Carl DeMaio is the ‘King of No. ’ No no no no no!”
While these antics are perhaps 
amusing on the surface, these men are vying to head the third-largest city in 
California and their debate etiquette 
is infantile at best. Based on what they actually said during the debate, The King of No and the Coin Toss Umpire (patent pending) didn’t differ that much on the real issues. In the small part of the debate when they actually mentioned visions for San Diego, both claimed they wanted more bike lanes, 
fixed potholes, more job opportunities 
for college graduates and to stimulate research and promotions for higher education.  Both candidates want fiscal responsibility, to keep the Chargers in San Diego and to expand the conven-tion center downtown to attract more tourists to the city.
Filner and DeMaio, who both 
claim to be champions of bipartisan-ship, did not display understanding of the word. No one expected them to endorse each other, but their sup-posed firsthand look for students at real-world politics called for a level of maturity not on display on Saturday. Negative campaigning is 
something we’ve come to expect from 
politicians, but civility is a value that even the President and the former Massachusetts governor (for the most part) brought to their Tuesday night debate. Civility’s apparent absence from the UCSD debate is concerning, considering that one of the children (read: candidates) will soon hold the 
city’s highest position.
According to a recent ABC10 news 
poll, Filner holds a sizable, double-
digit lead over DeMaio. But that could change and whoever wins on November 6 will need to grow up a bit, get past the partisan politics and name calling, to most effectively lead San Diego into a future full of bike paths, 
Chargers and no more potholes.
Oh. And jobs for college graduates. 
Those too please.

ARCADE 
REVISITED   
PAgE 6Arts & EntErt Ainm Ent
When Rich Moore arrived at 
Disney in 2008, he began developing ideas for an ani-
mated film that would take him back to his childhood. 
“I remember playing pong at a 
pizza place growing up, and you were controlling something on a TV , and for me TVs were made for watching and not interacting with, ” Moore told The Guardian in a conference call 
Sunday. “It’s been great watching the evolution of video games over the last 30 to 35 years. ”
While the video game industry 
was busy expanding and developing into the multi-billion dollar mam-moth it is today, Moore graduated from California Institute of the Arts in 1987 and was promptly asked to direct some episodes for a fledgling animated sitcom. That animated sitcom was “The Simpsons. ” Since, 
Moore has become a key figure in 
modern studio animation and has directed numerous classic episodes of  “Futurama, ” “Drawn Together” and of course, “The Simpsons. ”
Now, Moore has completed a 
project that Disney has been devel-oping about video games since the early 2000s, the upcoming “Wreck-It 
Ralph. ” The movie, in theaters Nov. 2, 
features the voices of John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jane Lynch and Jack McBrayer — an all-star cast of come-dic talents giving these familiar char -
acters a brilliant 3-D revamp.
“It was amazing to work with 
those four, and Alan Tudyk also, who’s in the cast as King Candy, ” Moore 
said. “Y ou know what’s great about it 
is that I’ve been a fan of these guys for a long time. All of them. ”Moore was especially in awe of 
John C. Reilly, the boisterous voice of the film’s towering, eight-foot tall 
eponymous villain-turned-hero.                          
“John just kind of gave his all for 
this character and is so invested in 
it, ” Moore said. “It’s not often that an actor in an animated film will say ‘can I come over and can we talk a little bit more about Ralph’ or, ‘I’ d love to meet the animators. ’ John is so funny and every character he 
plays feels like a real human being 
with a real heart — you really care about his characters, and you really want them to achieve what they want 
and desire. Ralph is just another one 
of those classic John characters. ”
In an interesting twist on the cli-
ché hero, the film introduces Ralph as the villain of a fictitious 8-bit game “Fix-it Felix Jr., ” reminiscent of the original “Donkey Kong” arcade game. Tired of being unappreciated and vilified by the other characters 
in his game, Ralph abandons his past 
and sets out to rename himself as one of the good guys.
Moore wanted the visuals of the 
film to feel authentic for gamers young and old, challenging the ani-
mation team to make an 8-bit land-
scape that would be captivating for viewers in today’s day and age. After Ralph escapes from the retro arcade throwback “Fix-It Felix, ” he travels to an ultra-realistic shooter, “Hero’s Duty” and a fusion of “Mario-Kart” and “Candyland” called “Sugar Rush. ” Transporting Ralph from one digital 
world to another world is the massive 
Game Central Station — resulting in a scene responsible for making 
A   lot has been said about Louis CK’s total disregard for con-tinuity throughout his criti-
cally acclaimed show “Louie, ” which recently finished its third season on 
FX. At last count, “Louie” has had two 
mothers (one a sympathetic agnostic, the other a bitter elderly lesbian), a brother, two seemingly unrelated sisters, a white ex-wife who is rarely seen and a black ex-wife who shows up periodically throughout season three to expose Louie’s flaws. She is 
also the biological mother to the two 
most adorable young daughters ever to grace a television screen. They also appear to be 100 percent Caucasian.
I know that last bit sounds a little 
racist and very bizarre, but part of the majesty of “Louie” is watching CK walk up to the edge of acceptability and piss into the abyss. Season one of 
“Louie” started off better than 90 per -
cent of what constitutes “comedy” on 
basic cable today, but season two was when Louis set his sights on some-thing even grander.
Season two — nominated for three 
Emmys, including Best Directing, Lead Actor, and Outstanding Writing (which he won) — saw Louie travel to 
Afghanistan on a USO tour, confront 
infamous joke thief Dane Cook, and visit an old ghost from his past who threatens to kill himself.
But no one said being a writer/
director/editor/producer/actor was easy, and sometimes the stretch marks showed themselves as “Louie” progressed through its sophomore 
season. It’s not that there were bad 
episodes in the first two seasons, but there were moments where you could see the show’s knees buckle under the weight of its own ambition.
Looking back on season three 
of “Louie, ” a new split has opened between the Louis CK we know and love and his fictionalized counterpart. 
In real life, Louis CK has learned just 
how well his own brand of fiercely independent comedy works. He made millions when he released his latest stand-up special on louisck .net for 
$5 and then sold his concert tickets — minus service fees — through the same website. Seeing his success, FX rightfully assumed that CK would 
want a larger budget and a primetime 
slot. CK refused on the grounds that it would hamper his creative control over the show. Even in his success, CK has maintained the kind of artistic integrity that would make Metallica fans jealous.
But the Louie in “Louie” is some-
one who is much less certain of 
his future, and even his talent, and 
nowhere is distinction more apparent than in the epic three-part episode “Late Night, ” in which Louis’s sad-sack fictionalized Louie manages to “go viral” after a spur-of-the-moment stint on “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. ” The opportunity to take over David Letterman’s soon-to-be-empty 
seat at “The Late Show with David 
Letterman” is presented as his final chance at fame before he’ll be forced to teach comedy at a community col-lege in order to feed his kids. (With that said, a “Louie”/”Community” crossover episode could only be the most amazing thing ever.)
Throughout season three, the only 
times we get close to real-life Louis is through the short stand-up bits, which have become a rarity compared to seasons past. But when Louie In Between

Funny man Tyler Perry finally becomes the 
blood-thirsty, ass-kicking rogue cop we never wanted to see.
By Jacey aldredge • contriButing Writer
There’s just something about 
Tyler Perry cascading off the side of a crumbling cement 
wall in slow motion that doesn’t mix well. Actually, Tyler Perry 
didn’t mix well with most 
of the things that occur in “ Alex Cross. ” Directed by Rob Cohen (“Dragonheart, ” anyone?) and based on the detective novels written by James Patterson, “ Alex Cross” has “action movie” written all over it. At least, that’s what 
was written all over it, until someone 
came along and scribbled in enough bad jokes to scare away “Saturday Night Live. ”
Meant to represent the 12th book 
of the “Cross” saga, “ Alex Cross” serves as an origin story for the well-known fictional detective/psycholo-gist/family man. The script, written by Marc Moss (whose only other work is another Alex Cross film adapta-tion, “ Along Came a Spider” starring 
Morgan Freeman) and 
Kerry Williamson (who 
has no other work), focuses on Cross’s stint on the Detroit police force pre-FBI days. It starts off like any other action-oriented psycho-thriller: gunshots, 
chase scenes, scratch-free explosions, 
and a ludicrously sadistic sociopath 
serial killer played by a scarily gaunt Matthew Fox, who is out to get the rich and powerful (and a dead woman sans fingers).

As a communication major (don’t 
laugh), you’ d think I’ d have fig-ured out how to communicate 
by now. But I’ll let you in on a little secret: Majoring in communications 
teaches you little to nothing about 
communicating in the real world. Sure, you learn how to get through a Michel Foucault piece without cry-ing in the shower afterwards. And if you really pay attention you can even learn really abstract, outdated theories like the conduit metaphor. 
But what you won’t learn is how to 
communicate, at least not by today’s standards.
At one point in time, com-
municating was simple. It was an exchange of words that happened in person or handwriting. Due to fabu-lous technological advances, today there are now hundreds of ways to 
reach someone — meaning, there 
are also about a hundred more ways to misinterpret someone’s message. 
As a generation we’ve made a 
pretty smooth transition from phone calls and love letters to texting and instant messaging. Getting a hand-written love letter brings up more Dating

associate 
lifestyle editorIllustrat Ion By Janella  Payumo /Guardianmatch with Michael Sullivan/The 
Butcher/Picasso (Can he get any more nicknames?) a crazed hitman work-ing for a paranoid French millionaire, complete with fetishes for charcoal 
drawings and inflicting pain. He’s also 
got a bad habit of evading capture, 
always one step ahead of our acutely 
aware detective. As Cross and his childhood friend and police partner Tommy Kane (Edward Burns) hunt 
down Picasso, he in turn decides to 
mentally torture Cross in the worst possible ways. After shooting down Cross’s pregnant wife on their anni-versary and killing his female partner (Rachel Nichols), Cross becomes consumed with capturing Picasso. A battle of cat-and-mouse ensues but, to paraphrase Picasso, embarking on 
a journey of revenge requires digging 
two graves.
While the plot appears to be load-
ed with cheap suspense and danger, fear not — there’s plenty of comedic dialogue wedged in there for a giggle. And while there are indeed some humorous moments, especially those between Perry and Burns (their banter 
over who gets the “honor” of opening 
a safe with a severed thumb was cause for more excitement than most every-thing else in the film), for the most part, the movie is full of irrelevant jokes awkwardly placed amongst the shoot-’ em-up action sequences for the sole purpose of getting a laugh. Take a simple scene involving two computer 
nerds giving the cops Picasso-related 
information, which was completely missed because of an irrelevant Geico caveman joke made at the expense of the two actors, who were apparently hired only to wield large beards. 
Tyler Perry’s debut as a dramatic 
actor is more of a lackluster, if slightly puzzling fizzle than an absolute fail-
ure. The lumbering Perry can’t help but carry a certain goofy charisma on 
screen — it was as though Perry got lost on his way to the Medea dressing room and ended up on the set of “ Alex Cross. ” He fumbles, uncomfortably delivering lines and trying as hard as he can to pretend to be a tough guy. Perry’s not a terrible stone-faced lead-ing man, but he’s not a very believable 
or engaging one either.
The other actors aren’t any more 
comfortable on camera. Edward 
Burns and Rachel Nichols’ relation-ship is awkward and rushed and her character is disposed of before any real chemistry can be sparked between the two. Then there’s the super weird casting of John C. 
McGinley as the stiff police chief, a far 
cry from the snarky Dr. Cox he played so well on “Scrubs. ” Stranger still is Jean Reno as the two-timing French damsel Leon Mercier, whose accent falls somewhere between Spanish and South Carolinian.
In the midst of all these grown 
actors being uncomfortable is the 
fragile innocence of Cross’s daugh-ter, played by a fresh Y ara Shahidi. 
Following her mother’s death, she steals the room with a raw under -
standing of vulnerability and pain far beyond her years. And then there’s Matthew Fox (“Lost”). Deadly, dangerous and ripped as hell, Fox’s Picasso is, if nothing else, frightening. 
In fact, the only thing more dis-
tressing than Fox’s crazy killer eyes is how hard they are to see amidst the camera’s superfluous shaking. “ Alex Cross” gives even “Cloverfield” a run for its money during a pivotal fight scene between Cross and Picasso in a worn-down theater.
Consistently, the best parts of this 
film were the silent ones. The final 
moments of “ Alex Cross” hit home the 
hardest — the melancholy laughter of two old friends, the simple action of Cross’s daughter playing the piano after screaming that she never would again, the shared looks of relief and stifled pain between mother and son. But be warned: Before you see this movie, dig three graves. Y ou might 
want one too. comes out the of the other side of his 
audition unscathed (albeit without 
the job), he transforms into the Louis 
CK we know and love, who’s not afraid to march to the front of the Ed Sullivan Theater and proudly shout 
“Hey Letterman! FUCK YOU! I did 
it!” Behind the scenes, the audacity of the arc is shown in the sheer num-
ber of guest stars: Jerry Seinfeld, Jay 
Leno, Chris Rock, Garry Marshall, Paul Rudd, Susan Sarandon and even David Lynch all appear in one form or another. But in front of the camera, we watch the story of a man coming to terms with his own talent and all the possibilities it can bring.
With Louis and Louie on the same 
page, the possibilities are even more 
infinite than they ever were before. A 
new twitter page called “Fake Louie Episodes” is full of potential storylines that are as hilarious as they are entire-
ly possible in the upcoming fourth 
season. One suggestion reads, “Louie is asked to host the Oscars. Is stalked 
by a vindictive Billy Crystal. Hikes a 
mountain. ” But until we get our first tastes of this new “Louie, ” I’ll be sing-ing that theme song all year long.
“Louie Louie/Y ou’re gonna 
dieeeeee. ”

Puzzling Cast and Concept Add “Cross”’ Chaos
▶ Cross from page 6
“Wreck-It Ralph” the Disney film with the most individual characters to date. At 190 unique characters, featuring cameos from video game favorites like Bowser, Q-Bert, Sonic 
the Hedgehog and many more. 
“I’ll be honest, 190 characters 
does not seem like that much to me, ” 
Moore said. “I like ambitious stuff, and I like big casts and big movies. ‘The Simpsons’ in its day was very ambitious and I never wanted to back down from a challenge, so I’m really proud of what we achieved. ”
This confidence didn’t arrive over -
night. Moore started out in the ani-mation business when it was at per -
haps its lowest point and the future for animators looked bleak, with jobs few and far between. But Moore’s pas-sion and love for animation kept him invested in the field.
“We just kept at it, and we just 
had faith that something was going to happen, ” Moore said. “For this to happen, for this dead and desolate business to revive, who would have thought it would happen… It’s all out there waiting for people, for filmmakers to come out and grab it and do with it what you would, 
because it’s not going to stay the 
same, it’s always changing. Whatever you want to do it is totally possible, you just have to jump in and stick with it because the ones that stick in are the ones that make it. ”
Today, animation is a burgeoning 
industry, and with “Wreck-It Ralph, ” Moore is pushing the craft to new 
heights. He’s also realized a dream he’s 
had since he was a child, busting his fingers under the neon glow of the arcade’s blinking splendor.  
“I got a talk several times from my 
parents that went, ‘you are wasting your time at that arcade and no good will come of playing video games, ” Moore said. “I like to think I proved 
them wrong. ” “Ralph” Brings Classics to Life

CalbI  FooD  TRuCk
Calbi, a food truck that visits 
the UTC parking lot, com-bines Korean barbeque into 
classic taco truck dishes, part of the new “fusion food” trend that’s been 
taking California eateries by storm.
Aside from the quirky dish 
names, the results of the trend are 
distinctly hit or miss. The misses are a prone to clashing flavor combinations, 
while the hits are 
memorable, unique pairings that give taste buds a new way to experience classic dish-es. It takes a chef with a nuanced approach to flavor to pair tastes and textures that comple-
ment each other.  
Calbi’s menu is 
scarce, featuring varia-
tions of three classics: quesadillas, tacos and burritos. Teriyaki chicken replaces chipotle, and bulgogi beef takes the place of carne asada steak. But of course cheese makes every-thing better, so that stays.
The chicken quesadilla ($8) 
comes with teriyaki barbeque chicken and citrus ginger sauce in a thick tortilla. Unfortunately, the sweet, smoky flavor of the bar -
bequed chicken that Korean food is notorious for was lost in the cheese and thick tortilla. And while we’ d invested high hopes in the sauce, it 
wasn’t any more remarkable than 
something you’ d find at a Rubio’s salsa bar. The tacos (three for $7.50) fared better — less cheese and the addition of some spiced greens gave more room for the flavors of the respective marinades of the pork and chicken to come through. We recommend you steer clear of the tofu tacos. While it is a difficult feat, vegetarian tacos can be done well. But Calbi’s version is nothing more than some baked, bland tofu chopped up and tossed into soft 
taco shell.
The beef burrito ($8), however, 
absolutely stole the show. Stuffed 
with bulgogi beef, kimchi, cheese 
and greens, wrapped in a tortilla thick enough to 
absorb the juicy compo-
nents, it demonstrated the delicate pairing of flavors that makes fusions food worth the search. Korean bulgogi beef is subtly sweet and mouthwateringly ten-der, and this time the taste of the beef was enhanced 
by the cheese rather than 
inhibited by it. And who-ever thought of using kim-
chi — fermented spiced cabbage — as a “salsa” for the bulgogi is nothing short of genius; kimchi, a national Korean dish, is on its own crispy and satisfying. The spiced vegetable was a great contrast to 
the beef, both because of its texture 
and the spice.
Combining classic taco truck 
meals with Korean food, with its rich, full-bodied marinades, is a great way to present classic San Diego staples. Even the more lack-luster dishes have potential with a little ingredient re-rationing. At rea-
sonable prices and generous help-
ings that compare with most other taco trucks and the convenience of its location, Calbi’s taco truck has just enough to offer to push it over to our hit list.

For each word of ecstatic praise 
they’ve received over the course of their two decades 
of existence, Godspeed Y ou! Black Emperor has earned exactly one 
skeptic’s eye-roll. The Canadian 
eight-piece collective is overly seri-ous, unnecessarily mysterious and their music is self-described as being thematically political (despite the fact that their songs are instru-mental). 
“Why should I surrender to this 
myth-band’s ham-fisted allusions to 
Israel?” you may rightly ask your -
self. “ And doesn’t their exhausting 
band name, punctuated by an arbi-trary exclamation point, seem to mock the listener for even trying?”
This conundrum is forgotten 
approximately four minutes into the band’s latest surprise release “ Allelujah! Don’t Bend! Ascend!” 
On opener “Mladic, ” an aviary of 
effects-pedal squawks is cast into a pulsating inferno of carnal drums and a massive, slow-mounting drone. When the build (which lasts nearly three minutes) finally peaks in a menacing belly dance from hell, it’s one of those rare moments that grabs you by the ankles and hurtles you into the abyss. It’s also a rare moment of clarity for the band, which now finds itself squarely in the domain of raw metal riffing. Gone are the eerie field record-ings and avant-orchestration of Godspeed Y ou! Black Emperor’s dense 2000 album “Lift Y our Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven, ” replaced here with an urgent, hyp-nosis-by-volume approach in the vein of Sleep’s stoner-metal mani-
festo “Dopesmoker. ”
The second half of the album 
consists of the less menacing, 
20-minute-long “We Drift Like Worried Fire” (the remaining two tracks are shorter transitional ambi-ance composed by the band’s core songwriters). Here, beautifully employed guitar wailing reminds us 
where latter-day post rock outfits 
like Explosions in the Sky draw inspiration, before the track takes a darker turn, vaulting into a moto-rik jam that soars triumphantly through space.
In this visceral power, it’s easy to 
sympathize with the band’s desire to contextualize their music in the 
ultra-serious. But “ Allelujah!” is as 
much about politics as it is about violence or struggle in general — and, thus, whatever subjective associations these conjure for the individual. Let it soundtrack your own catharsis.

a&e eDIT orScuzzy Montreal crooner Mac DeMarco’s appropriately titled second album, “2, ” is not the 
kind of album that immediately makes an impression on the listen-
er. In fact, if you’re not paying close 
attention, “2” can sound positively unoriginal — its meandering guitar lines and shuffling rhythm section are reminiscent of a multitude of 
bands who have come to promi-
nence in recent years.
The difference, however, 
between Mac DeMarco and artists like Beach Fossils or Teen Daze is that DeMarco possesses the kind 
of irreverent songwriting chops 
that allow him to create beautiful, carefully crafted (and above all, extremely catchy) melodies that still maintain the illusion of effort-lessness. Highlights “My Kind of Woman” and “ Annie” sound like lost classic rock anthems, while “Ode to Viceroy, ” an homage to 
DeMarco’s preferred brand of bud-
get-priced Canadian cigarettes, uses its gritty, unflattering subject mat-ter to disguise a melody that could be lifted off a golden-era Elton 
John album.
If “2” contains any faults, it’s 
that DeMarco’s unaffected produc-
tion style often becomes a victim 
of its own unobtrusiveness, allow-ing DeMarco’s catchy songs to 
become almost unnoticeable under 
the blankets of yacht-rock guitar tones and linear rhythmic deci-sions. However, these moments occur rarely, and “2” stands as an excellent statement, one that places DeMarco alongside artists like Grimes and TOPS in Montreal’s increasingly exciting art rock scene.

from stressful city lives. Many parks 
are available for picnic sites and campgrounds. 
“Paso Picacho is a great place 
to hike and camp, ” Menghini said. 
“Not to mention the beautiful 
government park, William Heise County Park, that is situated along the northern extremity of the La-guna Mountain Range, where each season brings dramatic changes. ” 
Forests of oak, pine and cedar 
embrace the peaceful mountain meadows and offer a naturally 
peaceful setting for miles of scenic 
hiking and equestrian trails. Wild animals like mule deer and wild turkeys are often seen throughout the park, as are more species like bobcats and mountain lions. There are also cabins available.
Shopping
Julian transports tourists back 
through time and offers a glimpse 
of post-Civil War life. Unique tour -
ist shops on the town’s Main Street and B Street sell all types of craft goods. 
“There’s a store called Bird 
Watchers, which is one of the biggest businesses in town. It’s a bird lover’s paradise. We’re pretty famous for that, ” Menghini said. The specialty shops offer a range 
of goods including handmade 
candles and knives, antiques, herbal wreaths and bird and clown lovers. What’s great about these shops is that they’re all within walking dis-tances. It’s easier for people to walk by and feel the unique personality of each shop. Because Julian’s peak season includes the autumn apple harvest and the winter holidays (September through December), beware of the large crowds on the 
streets during those times of year. 
Julian Makes for a Beautiful Weekend Getaway

questions to young people then an 
IM, even though the simple use of something like “ttyl” would confuse the hell out of the love letter genera-tion. Only one person has ever sent 
me handwritten love letters, which 
were quite sweet, but confusing nonetheless. 
There’s a scene in an episode of 
“Girls” where Hannah recently finds out she has HPV and the guy who gave her the STD got it from a girl that often likes Hannah’s Facebook statuses. She complains to her friend 
Marnie, saying “It’s like, ‘Sorry I 
passed you an STD but I really enjoy your quirky Web presence. ’” In the last few weeks I’ve received an odd amount of likes on Facebook and Instagram from people I’ve dated or hooked up with in the past. And no, no STDs, but like Hannah, I felt like their appreciation for my “quirky Web presence” was just as odd and it made me wonder what it meant, if 
anything at all. 
I fell out of touch with them 
primarily because I moved back 
to school since the summer ended and so there wasn’t so much as a phone call. But with so many new ways to communicate (and so many ways to confuse me and most other neurotic girls), these exes and old 
hookups have been passive aggres-
sively liking pictures of some DIY project in my apartment or embar -
rassing “selfies” of my roommates and I. I wasn’t sure what to do so I just disingenuously liked a photo of their car or band back and figured that was even. I don’t want to read too far into any of this because that’s the one thing a girl in this situation shouldn’t do. I have no interest in 
perpetuating crazy girl stereotypes. 
But in general, I’m interested in how dating communication has changed since the emergence of such technologies and what’s next. Are we really all going to go back to MySpace (it does actually look pret-ty cool) and bring back those horrid bulletins we all posted in seventh 
grade? At least I’ll have my stellar 
communications classes to guide me through all this, right? Well, maybe not so much.
hini. “Julian is certainly a fine place to grow apples. ” 
During September and October, 
about five apple orchards open up for “U-picks. ” For a small fee, fam-
ily and friends can pick a variety 
of apples (and pears, at certain orchards) to bring back home. A 
popular venue is the Raven Hill Or -
chard, which is the largest U-pick 
apple orchard in Julian. 
Transformed into a beautiful 
shade of gold in autumn, the land-scape is surrounded by farmland 
and rolling hills. Because Raven 
Hill Orchard is an organic orchard, it is not uncommon for people to bite into the succulent apple on the spot. Just look out for a worm hole on the apple before taking a bite. Julian Apple Pies
If picking apples sounds like too 
much work, there’s an easier way to indulge in the nature of this quaint town — Julian apple pies. If there is one thing Julian is really famous for, 
it’s apples and apple pies. For many, 
Thanksgiving isn’t complete without the perfect apple pie. 
“Being so close to San Diego, 
where it’s not a very good place to grow deciduous fruits, Julian is an ideal place to be during the fall time 
with freshly baked apple pies — 
very fall-ish thing, ” Menghini said. 
Be sure to stop by Julian Pie 
Company to pick up their crusty creations for a pre-Thanksgiving celebration with friends in San Diego or before driving back home for the holiday. Although Julian Pie Company tries to use local apples 
whenever possible, its pies are in such high demand that most come 
from other parts of the country. Different varieties of apples are used for different pies, so it can be fun to hunt for your favorite type of apple by trying out their various 
pies. 
Their pie variations are not only 
limited to apples — they also have 
classic pies like pecan, pumpkin, 
blueberry and peach. Frozen un-baked pies are also sold to bake at home. Make sure to place an order 
early so you can pick it up yourself 
or have it shipped.
Hiking and Camping
Julian doesn’t leave out wilder -
ness explorers. As leaves turn and 
apples grow to perfection in au-tumn, the forests are a great escape Julian Apple Picking is Perfect for Fall Fun

The annual nationwide celebra-tion of Food Day — a move-ment towards healthy, afford-
able and sustainable food that began in 2011 — is just around the corner. 
In honor of this campaign, UCSD 
will be hosting a sustainable food expo next Wednesday, Oct. 24 from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Exhibitions by food movement leaders — sus-tainable food suppliers, community and student organizations — will be 
set up throughout Price 
Center Ballroom East.
It’s an opportunity to 
meet and connect with those who are passionate about transforming the American diet and addressing issues about our nation’s food policies in relation to their impact on hunger, health, workers, 
animals and the environment. While 
learning about the many problems surrounding food, you can pick up a few tips on how to lead healthier, more eco-friendly lives. As a bonus, you’ll be able to enjoy free samples and collect resources to take home. 
Just to name a few of the suppliers 
and organizations that will be tabling, 
Fair Trade San Diego, San Diego 
Sustainable Living Institute and Ellie’s Garden at UCSD will be represented at the fair. For the excessively health-conscious, you’ll be able to consult the nutritionists and dietitians who will also be present at the event.
Food Day, created by the Center 
for Science in the Public Interest (an 
independent science-based organi-
zation that advocates public health), 
strives to empower and consolidate the food movement. According to their website, they hope to promote safer, healthier diets, support sustainable and organic 
farms, reduce hunger, 
reform factory farms to protect the environment and support fair work-
ing conditions for food and farm workers. Judging by today’s increas-ing consumption of harmfully pro-cessed and fast-food products, this movement can only improve our 
food system. 
Like many throughout the nation 
who will be celebrating Food Day in 
schools, college campuses, farmers markets, City Halls and state capitals, UCSD will be no different. So come out, learn a thing or two about where your food comes from and show your support. As their flyer says, “It’s time 
to eat real, UCSD. ”

applicant, who would have been rejected even if she were 
not white — to nurse her hurt pride. 
The University of Texas at Austin has a two-tiered 
application process. Three-quarters of its spaces are reserved for the top 8 percent of students from Texas 
high schools (10 percent when Fisher applied), who are 
automatically admitted. Fisher’s chances were ruined not by her race, but by her grades, which put her outside this tier and into a group that also looks at six other factors, including extracurricular activity, leadership potential, community service, legacy and, of course, race. Gregory Garre, lawyer for the University of Texas, notes that even if Fisher had achieved a perfect score on these other factors (i.e. if she were black), she still would not have been 
admitted because her academic performance was simply 
too poor to make up for this “personal achievement score. ” Details of the UT system’s policy aside, it is crucial to 
uphold Grutter and at least have the flexibility of looking at 
race as a factor in holistic admission. Though other factors, 
such as income, are large components of the achievement 
gap, race affects so many other life chances — from stereotype threat to the fact black students are nearly three times less likely to be admitted to highly selective colleges even when controlling for income — that it is not outrageous to at least consider it when evaluating personal achievement and struggles. 
In this vein, nearly 100 briefs have been filed in the case: 
17 in support of Fisher, and 73 in support of the University 
of Texas; the supporters of the University of Texas include 
Teach for America, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Ivy Leagues and our very own University of California. These groups recognize that diversity on college campuses is a necessary first step to promoting opportunity and diversity in the work force and  ultimately, equality in the United States.Dear Editor,
“Did you register to vote?” a 
female student asked me, with a big smile, as I walked through the 
campus.
“No, ” I quickly responded as I 
smiled back. 
“Would you like to register?” 
she said. “It takes only about sev-
eral minutes. I can help you,“ she insisted.  
“Sorry, I’m late to class, ” I half-
lied.  
She probably thought that I was 
lazy, apathetic or ignorant. But that’s the farthest from the truth. I wish I could have told her that I have wanted to vote ever since I turned 18. And, I wish I could have told her the reason I cannot vote — I am undocumented.
Ever since I moved to this coun-
try from South Korea at the age of 11, I grew up just like many other American students. I attended local public schools, learned English, joined sports teams and was involved in many different student organiza-tions.
I eventually made my way to 
UC Berkeley after transferring from 
Laney College. In college, I studied 
political science and became increas-ingly involved in student govern-ment — first as the student president at Laney and later as a student sena-tor at Cal.
Even after I graduate from the 
top public university with a degree in political science, I cannot participate 
in the voting process. I am just one 
person, but there are approximately 2.1 million DREAM Act eligible stu-dents who have earned or are pursu-ing a college degree in the U.S., but cannot exercise the right to vote.Some may argue that we do 
not deserve to vote because we are undocumented.  This may sound logically reasonable, but it goes far beyond obtaining a U.S. citizenship. 
Whether documented or undocu-
mented, there were times when African Americans, women and other underrepresented communities did not have the right to vote.
Even today, many people are 
having difficulty voting because of restricted laws to purposely prevent them from having the right to vote. For example, Tennessee voter ID law restricts people from participating in the voting process because signifi-cant proportions of underrepresent-ed communities do not possess gov-ernment-issued photo identification. 
Clearly our current voting process 
is flawed. Thus, policy makers and elected officials should encourage as many people in this country to par -
ticipate in the voting process as they can, instead of punishing them by creating discriminatory laws against underrepresented communities. 
The November presidential 
election is just around the corner. Though I am unable to vote, I encourage others to vote in this criti-cal election.  Voting is a basic right, a civic duty and a responsibility as citizens in this country — we should not take it for granted.  
Y ou should vote because there are 
millions of undocumented immi-
grants, like me, who want to vote, 
but are unable to do so because of their immigration status.
Y ou should vote because people 
fought and died for the right to vote in this country.  
Y our vote matters, your vote 
counts, your vote can change a per -
son’s life.

Inquire at jobs@ucsdguardian.org“Last year as a redshirt fresh-
man, I came off the bench, and 
only played around 40 minutes a game, ” Pozurama said. “This year as a starter, it’s good to know that 
I’m making more of an impact on 
the team, and assuming more of a leading role. ”
The two wins have put UCSD, 
8-1-2 in the CCAA, eight points in front of second place in the CCAA South Division CSU Los Angeles and nine points in front of third place Cal Poly Pomona. With four 
conference matches left in regular 
season play, the Tritons have all but clinched a spot in the CCAA Championships, while in the North Division, the race has tightened up between No. 5 Sonoma State and No. 20 CSU Stanislaus.
“With the two wins we have 
moved up in front of CSU Stanislaus, but are still behind Sonoma State, ” Pozurama said. “Hopefully this weekend we can go ahead of Sonoma too. ”  
The Tritons’ next game is slated 
for next Friday at RIMAC Field. 
The match is expected to be 
one of the most anticipated con-ference games this season, as CSU Stanislaus has the most dangerous striker in senior Karene Demery. Demery has scored the most goals in the conference with 14, and was named to the all-CCAA First Team 
in 2011.
“We know [CSU Stanislaus] is 
a good team, ” Pozurama said. “We 
know that they have one of the best forwards in the CCAA. We will probably man-mark her to take her out of her game. From there we’ll just try and play our own game. ”

“Y ang was filling in for Marc

solid player, ” Garcia said. “He will definitely be traveling for us, and will be a big help to the team. He 
was certainly one of the reasons 
why we did so well at the invita-tional. ”
UCSD sophomore Jay Lim, the 
Tritons’ most consistent performer, finished second for the Tritons with an overall score of 215, to tie him for 12th place. 
Freshman Clayton Y amaguchi 
tied for 24th, along with juniors Lewis Simon and Jacob Williams. The three all finished with an over -
all score of 220, four over par.
Okasaki says the Tritons will 
look to log another strong per -
formance next weekend at the 
Monterey Bay Invitational, Oct. 
22–23.
“There should be a stronger 
field at the CSU Monterey Bay 
Invitational, and the scores are 
going to be much higher, ” Okasaki 
said.   “ And although it’s a harder 
course, I think that with the guys that we have now, we should be able to par even. ”

UCSD to Host CCAA Cross Country Championships

Contributing Writer
CROSS COUNTRY  — UCSD is 
scheduled to host the CCAA Cross 
Country Conference Championships 
this Saturday, Oct. 20. The Triton men will be up against Chico State, who are currently ranked No. 1 in the West Region, along with regionally ranked Humboldt State, San Francisco State and Cal Poly Pomona. 
UCSD head coach Nate Garcia 
expects junior Kellen Levy, sopho-
more Tanner Collins and sophomore 
Scott Acton to perform well this week-end. 
“ All three have proven that they 
have the skills to lead the squad, ” Garcia said.
On the women’s team, junior Chia 
Chang has run strong throughout the season. Garcia says to also look out 
for freshmen Carolina Guzman and 
Marie Diaz. The women’s team will be up against regionally ranked CSU Chico, Humboldt State, San Francisco State, Cal Poly Pomona, CSU Los Angeles and CSU Stanislaus.
The Tritons will look to match up 
with high-ranked CSU Chico. 
“We know we’ve got our work cut 
out for us, but we intend to make them really work for the conference battle, ” Garcia said. “If they’re going to win, 
we’re really going to make them work 
hard for it. ”
The men’s team will begin the 8K 
race on RIMAC Field at 9 a.m., and the women’s team will start the 6K race at 10 a.m. They will finish inside the Triton Track and Field Stadium. The course, which runs through the can-yon, offers runners a challenge with steep inclines through the woods fol-lowed by a final dash to the finish line.
Last year the men’s team finished 
third, and the women’s team finished fourth in the CCAA Championships.
“Both teams have been working 
all year and are dedicated to improve their standings and we’re going to see what we can do at the CCAA Championships, ” Garcia said.

16 THE UCSD GUARDIAN | THURSDAY, OCTOBER 18, 2012 | www.UCSDGUARDIAN .ORG
With two back-to-back 
wins last weekend against CCAA South Division 
opponents, the Tritons have moved up 13 places to claim the No. 15 spot 
in the nation — a solid rebound after 
an overtime loss and two double overtime draws last weekend.
On Friday, Oct. 12, UCSD faced 
second place in the South Division, CSU Los Angeles. The Tritons took an early lead just over nine min-utes into the match, as sophomore defender Michelle Y asutake slotted 
the ball to senior midfielder Jessica 
Wi. Wi — UCSD’s second top goal-scorer — played a cross through to junior forward Izzy Pozurama. Pozurama got in front of Los Angeles keeper Gabriella Batmani to flick a header in to win the game.
“We started off the game really 
well, but I think in the second half the play really lagged, ” Pozurama 
said. “We weren’t connecting our 
passes and finding each other. Luckily, our defense were able to hold our lead. ”
On Sunday, Oct. 14, Pozurama 
scored two goals, leading UCSD to a 3–1 win over southern California rival CSU Dominguez Hills. For her efforts, Pozurama, who has taken a 
backseat to upperclassmen in years 
past, was named CCAA Player of the Week.TRITONS BACK

MEN’S SOCCER — Expectations have 
been high for the UCSD Men’s Soccer 
team, who went into last weekend’s 
matches just one game behind top-of the CCAA South Division CSU Los Angeles.
 UCSD faced both teams last 
weekend in matches that reorganized the South Division hierarchy, as the Tritons were shut out in both games. UCSD picked up zero points in the 
weekend’s campaign, allowing CSU 
Dominguez Hills — formerly third place — to leapfrog past the Tritons into the second spot.
On Friday, the Tritons hosted the 
Golden Eagles, formerly the only team to have beaten the UCSD in conference play. In the rematch, CSU Los Angeles caught the Tritons off 
guard, as the Golden Eagles took the 
lead with just over a minute left on the clock. And although the Tritons managed to outshoot Los Angeles in both periods, tallying 10 shots to the Golden Eagles’ six, UCSD was unable to find the net. 
“Los Angeles was a tough game, 
we hadn’t been giving up a lot of goals, 
and we’ve been taking a lot of pride in 
that, ” UCSD Head Coach Jon Pascale said. “We were a little stunned by giv-ing up that goal so early, and we felt like we gave it away. We were a little shell-shocked, and CSULA is really good about making you pay for mis-takes, and they certainly did that to us. ”
Freshman goalkeeper Cameron 
McElfresh was only called to action twice in the entire match, as the Golden Eagles only managed two 
shots on goal.
On Sunday, the Tritons traveled 
up to CSU Dominguez Hills, facing 
the Toros for the second time this sea-son. UCSD won a narrow 1-0 match against the Toros back at the end of September, but did not fare as well in the rematch, allowing the Toros an uncharacteristic 13 chances on goal, 
for three total goals.
“Dominguez has been the best 
team we’ve seen all year, ” Pascale said. 
“They have a lot of good attacking players. Y ou need a couple of breaks in order to get some type of result. We weren’t our best against them, and we made a couple of mistakes. ” 
The 3-0 deficit is the largest margin 
the Tritons have lost by this season, as the UCSD backline has been one of the toughest to break down in the conference. The Tritons currently have the second lowest goals against aver -
age, with 0.59, just above CSU San Bernardino.
Conversely, UCSD’s trouble in 
front of the net proved problematic 
last weekend. The Tritons are also 
averaging the second lowest number of goals this season with 0.8, with CSU Monterey Bay trailing in last place.
Now in third place, with four con-
ference games left to play, UCSD will need to win their next few matches to climb back into playoff position.
“Y ou’re never happy after a couple 
of losses  — obviously they weren’t happy after their performance, ” Pascale said. “We just need to remind ourselves to take it one day at a time. Win, lose or draw, you’ve got to move on really quick. We’ve moved on and want to do well this weekend.
The Tritons are four points behind 
second place CSU Dominguez Hills 
and six points behind first place CSU 
Los Angeles heading into this week-end’s matches against top of the North Division squads, CSU Stanislaus and Chico State.
UCSD is slated for two home 
matches against CSU Stanislaus on Friday, Oct. 19 and Chico State on Oct. 21 for senior night. 
“The boys are excited to come 
home and protect our home turf and bounce back. Right now we’re kind of on the outside looking in, ” UCSD Assistant Coach Eric Bucchere said. “We definitely have a chance to over -
take Dominguez, but we’re just trying to take it one game at a time and focus on us. ”

GOLF —The Tritons finished third 
in a field of 16 teams last Monday–
Tuesday, Oct. 14–15 at the Sonoma 
State Invitational.     Shooting five under par, with a total score of 864, UCSD was nar -
rowly ousted from second place by CCAA opponent Sonoma State, who finished with 860. Hawaii Hilo took the championship with a score of 856.
“This was definitely one of our 
better finishes, but this is more of what we’re expecting out of this squad this year, ” UCSD Assistant Coach Keith Okasaki said. “We could have easily finished second, but made a few costly mistakes in the last round. ”
Freshman Daniel Y ang was 
UCSD’s top finisher, ending his first collegiate tournament with a final score of 213, three under par. Y ang tied for eighth overall.Golf
