Valentine’s Day beachgoers dis-
covered the body of a young Asian 
woman on the cliffs overlooking Black’s Beach just after noon on Sunday, Feb. 14.
Passersby reported the body to 
lifeguards, who called a helicopter to the scene. The paramedic from the helicopter found the body already entering rigor mortis — the stage in which the body becomes stiff, about three hours after death  — indicating she had been there for some time. 
The body was spotted on the side 
of the cliffs, just below Gliderport. The woman, reported by officers to be 18 years old and from Milbrae, Calif., has yet to be publicly identified.
She was found near a flashlight 
and backpack, which police officers said leads them to assume she was trying to reach the beach at night, via the Torrey Pines Gliderport Trail. According to San Diego Lifeguard Lt. Andy Lerum, the area sees an esti-mated 50 cliff rescues a year.
The body was covered in bruises 
and showed signs of blunt-force trau-ma, though the San Diego Medical Examiner’s Office has not released a formal cause of death. The San Diego Police Department currently assumes the woman’s fall was an accident.
“She fell off the cliffs — if it’s an 
accident, it’s not a criminal nature, ” a dispatch representative for the SDPD said. “So it’s being handled by the coroner’s office. For now, that’s all we have to go on. ”
Anyone with information is 
encouraged to contact the SDPD.

The Student Wellness Department 
is looking to take last spring’s tight-
ened smoking policy one step further by enacting a complete smoking ban on campus.
Last week, the Committee on 
Policies was formed to re-evaluate all campus health policies. According to A.S. Vice President of Student Life and member of the student advisory board to Student Wellness Ricsie Hernandez, the smoking policy is of particular con-cern, because current regulations —which prohibit smoking within 25 feet of any building — are often violated. 
Marshall College junior Connie 
Y ang agreed that the current smoking policy is rarely enforced.
“I don’t think students generally 
follow the policy, ” Y ang said. “I smell [cigarette smoke] everywhere, espe-cially near the Geisel entrance. ”
The university operates under the 
Smoke-Free Policy, which was instated in 1994 and applies to all UCSD facili-ties, owned or leased, regardless of location. The original policy prohibit-ed  smoking indoors, as well as within five feet of the main entrance or exit of any facility. 
Those regulations were tightened 
last year. In Spring Quarter 2009, the ban on smoking extended from within five feet of any facility to within 25 feet.
According to Associate Vice 
Chancellor of Student Wellness Karen Calfas, a complete ban of smoking on campus is not a new idea.  In Fall Quarter 2009, the UCSD Health Sciences campuses experimented with :7905.)(336;c790*,*,5;,9),.:469,:;<+,5;-,,:

In an effort to maintain opera-
tions at the Price Center and the Student Center, the University Centers Advisory Board has estab-lished a prospective referendum for the 2010 Spring Ballot — a proposal that would increase student fees each year to match statewide inflation.
The referendum, which will 
be discussed and voted on at this Wednesday’s A.S. Council meeting, would base its annual fee on changes in the Consumer Price Index. The CPI measures inflation by calculating the change in price of various goods and services as time progresses. As inflation increases, the amount of goods or services a single dollar can purchase decreases, so businesses pay more for the same level of operation and maintenance costs. 
Currently, students pay $76.50 
per quarter to fund $6 million of University Centers’ $11 million bud-get — a number that hasn’t changed since its Price Center East expansion in 2003. Should this referendum pass, it would fund the cost of inflation that University Centers faces year after year by compensating for that differ-ence, beginning Fall Quarter 2011.
“While [Price Center’s] enterprise 
income increases for inflation, the contribution from the student fee cur-rently does not, ” A.S. President Utsav Gupta said. “We would want the fee to reflect inflation, so the building could

do two things: stay in the black, and 
also build up as a reserve over time. ”
UCAB drew up the 
proposal for the refer-endum this year due to the stagnation of stu-dent enrollment.
“We didn’t need it 
before, because enroll-ment has been growing pretty steadily over the past 10 years, ” Taylor said. “So every time we get fresh new enroll-ment, the fee stayed the same, but the amount of fees we’re collecting essentially grows, so income grows. This has helped us operate and maintain the building without forcing us to rely on some-thing like a CPI. ”
Taylor said that other student fees 
account for inflation, and UCAB is attempting to do the same.
The referendum also prohibits 
UCAB from making any decision that would put University Centers in opera-tional debt, meanwhile preserving the amount of student fees paying off Price Center’s construction.
When Price Center 
decided to expand, it planned to pay with a refer-endum that dedicated $6.80 per-student per-quarter toward the debt accrued during the construction of Price Center West, and $36 toward the construction of Price Center East.
The new proposal 
would not affect either por-tion. Instead, only the other half of the current $76.50 University Centers fee — which finances operational costs in Price Center and the Student Center like building maintenance, cus-
todial services and marketing — would be affected by changes in the CPI.
Once the debt is paid off, that por-
tion of the fee — which totals $42.80 — would no longer be collected. But according to Gupta, the debt will not be fully repaid for “tens of years. ”
If the referendum doesn’t pass, University Centers will still require additional funds to keep its facilities open, and will likely request addi-tional student fees every year until a referendum passes, Gupta said.
“Even with operational changes, 
they just don’t have enough revenue coming in for everything they have to do, ” Gupta said. “If it doesn’t go through this quarter, they’ll probably eat at their reserves throughout the next year, and then ask A.S. again… It’s kind of a fiscal reality. ”
The referendum language also stip-
ulates that UCAB would be the offi-cial University Centers Board, giving it direct oversight over the centers, in place of its current advisory capacity.
When University Centers was 
founded in the 1980s, the University Centers Board — composed of stu-dents — had the final say in decisions regarding the center, and a director carried out its initiatives. However, according to Gupta, the structure was changed over a decade ago by univer-sity administration, making the board advisory and handing off the decision-making power to Student Life admin-istrators. The referendum, if passed, 
would call for a reversal of this change.
“When we’re dealing with a facil-
ity that’s funded in large part through student fees, it should be students who are making the decisions, ” Gupta said.

a one-year pilot policy that created a 
blanket ban on smoking at the UCSD Medical Center, Skaggs and other nearby facilities. For a smoother tran-sition, the policy designated outdoor smoking areas for the first six months.
However, Calfas said it is unlikely 
the main UCSD campus will adopt the same policy anytime soon, as it is too extreme to be widely implemented.
“ A completely smoke-free campus 
would be completely difficult and not realistic, ” Calfas said.
She said the committee will instead 
make its immediate focus the enforce-ment of the current 25-foot ban, then evaluate results after a year’s time.
The committee plans to issue a 
survey gathering student, faculty and staff opinions on regarding on-campus tobacco use by next quarter. It will then pass an amended draft of the policy to the Office of the Chancellor.
Hernandez brought up the issue 
at the A.S. Council meeting last Wednesday to gauge student represen-tatives’ position on the topic.  She said the council suggested Student Wellness more widely publicize the 25-foot rule before enacting a complete ban.
“This is a dominant issue on cam-
pus, and continues to get brought up a lot, ” Hernandez said. “For the most part, A.S. felt that before any strict action of strict ban to happen, the 25-foot smoking rule should be enforced. ”
The student advisory board has 
discussed several methods of gauging campuswide opinion, including online surveys, soliciting to various organiza-tions or creating focus groups. Surveys would be issued this  Spring Quarter.

TALKING POINTS
In an inter-
view with the Guardian, A.S. Council Transfer Senator Adam Powers (one of two under-graduates on the Parking and Transportation Committee) 
and Parking and Transportation Services Director Brian d’Autremont discussed the Transportation Referendum, a proposed student fee that recently failed to be voted onto the Spring Quarter ballot. 
Last Fall Quarter, d’Autremont 
approached the A.S. Council for funds, urgently asking for a referendum to bail out the Parking and Transportation Services. According to d’Autremont, the department desperately needs student funds — or else access to public transit and campus shuttles face drastic cuts for the coming year.
But despite the threat of a more 
cramped ride to school, the A.S. Council overwhelmingly voted against putting the Parking and Transportation Referendum on the spring ballot last Wednesday. Here, a student and administra-tor hash out the issue.

Guardian : Adam, could you explain why the coun-
cil didn’t think it wise to place the Transportation Referendum on the Spring Quarter ballot?Adam Powers: I think you answered the question a bit with your own question. We didn’t feel that the $25 per quarter was necessary, considering the research we’ve done on it … It would be the first time that the money from a referendum would be going outside the purview of student life, and we didn’t want to set that precedent — at least not unless we thought it was nec-essary. So, in lieu of passing the referendum or putting it on the ballot, we drafted a resolution to explore other options.G: Brian, why do you think the referen-
dum ultimately failed?Brian d’ Autremont:  Y ou know, I really 
can’t say the internal politics of what was decided. I think, legitimately, students had concerns about the efficiency of how things are run. And it’s an extremely effi-cient system, but unless you work with it every day, it’s hard to see that. G: I understand that one of the A.S. 
Council’s primary concerns was that your department hadn’t looked into enough alternative solutions, rather than going directly to the students to pay an additional $25 per quarter. Do you also feel that is true?BD: Well, no. We’ve worked now for the 
last three years on trying to get to the root of this situation. We’ve tried to find out exactly what the causes were of our transportation’s dilemma … We have 2,600 more people riding the bus than we had three or four years ago … It’s 100 gallons worth of diesel for each bus, every day. And so we’ve had costs, but it just exceeded our wildest imaginations.G: Are you confident that the student body will see 
cuts for Fall Quarter 2010 in the transportation offerings?BD: I think it’s very possible … From my point of 
view, the only thing I can do is either cut expenses or raise revenues. Three years ago, we had 52 buses oper-ating on a daily basis. We now have 40 buses, but we haul 2,500 extra people a day … There’s just no way to keep up with the exploding demand for public trans-portation. G: Why do you think the referendum failed?
AP: One of the reasons the referendum failed, and one of the many concerns behind it, is that the situ-ation is almost presented as a ‘Here is the solution: referendum’ and ‘Here are the alternatives: cuts to things like employment and shuttles’ ... We didn’t feel that, in a lot of ways, it was fair to say, ‘Pass this refer-
endum, ’ and without the additional money going into the system, these cuts are going to be made to services without significant student input. G: Do you think this would set a danger-
ous precedent and enable departments such as parking and transportation to come directly to the council and propose a referendum as sort of a bailout?AP: I’m generally not big on slippery-slope arguments, in terms of ‘We must not do this because of these concrete concerns, because of this possibility further down the road, ’ but it was one of the numerous concerns we had with it … We don’t see administrators as moustache-twirling villains, but at the same time, if you need money and you have services students need — and A.S. has, you know, the ability to write a referendum — we didn’t want to see those coming through the door. We’ d rather those conversations take place at a higher level, saying, ‘Hey, why aren’t you getting adequate funding 
from the places where that funding is supposed to come from?’ instead of passing off more onto the stu-dent body.G: What do you think the next steps are for your 
department, now that this has recently failed?BD: Well, the department is waiting on guidance and 
decisions to be made by the Transportation Policy Committee … There is roughly $3 million worth in

Las Vegas may be the epitome of 
American excess, but if you’re going to visit Sin City before 
you can order a straight whiskey with-out being escorted out of the bar, you run the risk of leaving with your wal-let embarrassingly full. How-to Guru has some well-tested tips for making the most of the experience (without wasting a night and a Benjamin on Cher’s 12th Farewell Tour). 
First and foremost, go with your 
cooler, old friends. The next best thing next to being 21 in Vegas is being around those who are. Don’t waste $200 on a fake ID with no magnetic strip; try to score an expired driver’s license from a friend who 
bears enough of a resemblance that 
the bouncer lets you in. (Girls, there’s no such thing as too much cleavage.) If you get your hands on an ID that says you’re 24, it’s a lot more legitimate when causally inspected among a sea of 20-somethings than a group of jit-tery 18-year-olds. 
Even if you can’t get a fake in time, 
there’s no need to be stuck sipping Red Bull your entire stay. Instead, pitch in a little extra so your older friends return with plenty of cheap, efficient booze in tow. Get someone to take you under his or her wing: The gates will open, and the alcohol and opportunities will flood down your throat in no time.
Be ready (and excited) to blow 
cash on unneeded extravagances. The Vegas experience isn’t complete with-out a depleted bank account and a consistently rising blood-alcohol con-tent. Withdraw cash for all the places you don’t want your parents seeing on your bank statement, and expect to pay $15 for a strip club (plus a wad of singles to lure Kandi’s assets up close), $40 for an elk-and-ostrich buffet and $79 for that two-girl special. 
Of course, no Vegas trip is com-
plete without the ultimate casino sta-ple: sketchy-ass old men. Don’t write them off completely — play your cards right and Hank from Reno just might buy you a bourbon. Ladies, a wink and a smile never hurt, but back away the moment that geezer starts to invade your space. Chastise him as you would a particularly horny dog; a bitchy “down boy” usually does the trick. 
A final piece of advice: Sleep 
when you’re dead. How-to Guru enjoys a nap as much as the next Adderall-fried student — just not in the flashiest city in the world. Let your hair down, because you’re not techni-
cally having fun unless brain cells 
are begging for better days of mere hyper-caffeination. Y ou may have been out staving advances from gui-dos geezers in the club since 11 p.m., but that’s no excuse to succumb to exhaustion before sunrise. Take slutty photos. Polish off half-empty bottles and warm fallen soldiers. Put “Bad Romance” on repeat ’til you’re face-
down on the carpet. Don’t worry, a 
couple efficient hours of shut-eye goes a long way — even if it is on a vomit covered bathroom floor at 8 a.m.. Lest you forget: This is Las Vegas. No mat-ter your age, you go big or go home.

Dear Editor,
I am writing to express my disap-
pointment with today’s cover story on 
the Guardian . As the newspaper, which 
is said to represent “The Student Voice Since 1967, ” the lack of journalistic integrity and bias that went into this article was simply outrageous. Instead of covering a major policymaker’s speech on campus, as your paper was supposed to do (the event which was put on by UCSD students), your article focused on the protest that went on once the event was concluded. There was not one picture of the ambassador, nor was there any mention of the chan-cellor’s support and appearance at the event, nor the standing ovations that the ambassador was given. This event was the best thing to ever happen for the pro-Israel movement on campus (which is frequently under attack), and the event was a positive experience for all involved, including the anti-Israel people asking questions. 
However, you did not focus on 
the real story of the ambassador, and instead focused solely on the negative reactions outside by the protesters, including a man not from UCSD named Mahmoud, who you inter-
viewed. He had posted online anti-
Semitic statements, such as deliberately pointing out that Oren is a Jew, and frequently accused him of being a Zionist war criminal. He even com-pared the state of Israel (the country which many of our students and facul-ty call home) to the Nazi Third Reich. Y our article completely revised the history of the event, and I am ashamed 
and angered that our school newspaper 
would report so unprofessionally.
Quick point of clarification: One, I’m actually the vice president of off-campus outreach for Tritons for Israel, but any letter submitted to the editor is on behalf of the individual and not on behalf of Tritons for Israel, which does not take a stand on press articles. There were members of TFI who did not think the article was as outrageously unprofessional as I did, and then there were others who did feel it was.
— Sam Spector
Senior, Marshall College
Dear Editor,
I am an active member in Tritons 
for Israel. I saw today’s article and I think you should be ashamed as to how you portrayed the event.
First off, it was entitled “Israeli 
Visitor Draws Crowd. ” Michael Oren is not an Israeli “visitor. ” He is the ambassador to the U.S. from Israel, a country that supports freedom and democracy, condones terror and makes many positive contributions to the world in which we live.
The front cover of the Guardian  
should not be a picture of the com-paratively small amount of protestors 
outside of our event, but a picture from 
the back of the auditorium showing Ambassador Oren speaking to the over 400 people in attendance. Showing protestors on the front cover shows that the focus of the event was on the protestors, when in reality, the focus was on the ambassador. Oren gave a great speech with many anecdotes and facts about one of the strongest rela-
tionships: the U.S.-Israel relationship. 
There is also something noticeably 
wrong with the picture. Y ou could 
call it a proportionality problem, but that would be “covering it up. ” The Palestinian flag is way too big for the stick that holds it. Also, notice careful-ly how you can see through the stick and see a sign behind it. All of the sticks that I’ve ever encountered aren’t transparent. Also, the flag covers the title of the newspaper, showing that the newspaper has a political agenda and does not support Israel’s rights.
Another problem with the 
front page is the caption “ Agree to Disagree. ” Y ou cite that “Palestinian supporters clashed with Israeli student groups, ” when there was no clash whatsoever. When the speech was over, the people who were quietly listening left. The protestors outside used their megaphones to make a whole lot of noise. I know that you write for a newspaper and are tempted to use powerful verbs, but the word “clashed” makes it sound like some-thing actually happened. Y ou yourself said that the protests “did not end in any arrests or major disruptions. ”
Overall, the article you wrote 
was extremely misleading. It ties the Guardian  to the pro-Palestinian side 
by covering the title of the newspaper with the flag and by the obvious photo editing used by the staff. Y ou should also work on presenting first-person observation and not using quotes as evidence. Firsthand accounts are much more accurate than secondhand accounts on an issue. I hope you write in the similar style during Apartheid Week in early May, giving the pro-
Israel standpoint of the event.
In sum, you should be ashamed of 
yourselves. In my eyes, the Guardian  
has lost all credibility as an unbiased 
and respected newspaper. The focus of the article and pictures should have been on Israel’s ambassador, not the protest that followed.
— Steven Perlin
Freshman, Revelle College
Dear Editor,
Y our coverage in the Guardian  of 
the visit and speech by Michael Oren (Israeli Ambassador to the U.S.) was not only a disgrace to UCSD, but truly shows the anti-Israeli views that the Guardian  writers hold. As a former stu-
dent and current employee of UCSD, I am ashamed of your focus on the nega-tive aspects of the event and obvious bias in your reporting. The Guardian  
is not a tool for propaganda, or for furthering personal agendas. I am far from being a journalist or a writer, but I believe a 10-year-old could have done a better job at portraying the truth. I am deeply saddened by your decision to publish this joke of an article, and now hope that the Guardian  team will 
take action to right this wrong.
— Alex Ghatan
Alumnus, UCSD
Dear Editor,
My friends and classmates were 
very disconcerted at the recent article on Michael Oren’s visit to UCSD. We felt that the article was heavily and unfairly biased and strongly misrep-resented the details and purpose of the talk. While Tritons for Israel took every step to allow peaceful and free discussion, I feel this article posed a 
very one-sided and harsh opinion that 
marred the reputation of all organiza-tions involved. It is for this reason that I kindly ask you to revoke that article.

cuts that needs to be made to make 
sure the budget is viable for the future.G: So where do you expect those cuts to primarily come from?BD: That I really can’t say, and I 
don’t vote on it. It’s a matter of stu-dent, staff and faculty-chair gover-nance picking which routes. G: OK, now Adam, as a council-
member, do you have any sort of expectations as far as what those cuts [might be]?AP: We have preferences and sug-
gestions, and any person watching or reading can check out our legisla-tion. A.S. can help you get a hold of it. The resolution that we passed, saying basically — we’re not outright saying we don’t want a referendum at all, we’re not ever saying, ‘Don’t come to the students for money. ’ Just come to us when you literally have no other option. And there are the other options. We think that definitely it’s reasonable to say ‘OK, $300,000 to $400,000 is not going to get us out of the red, but it would possibly drop the need of the refer-endum to, say, $25 to $20. ’ And we think $5 is a big difference … We definitely want to try to bring down that dollar figure as much as possible before we bring it to students for a vote.
At least I, personally, vote that if 
anything, we would start to look at subsidies for MTS, because the truth is even if you cut 100-percent subsi-dies of MTS — which we don’t want — guess what? MTS still comes to school. If you cut a blue-and-white shuttle, that shuttle is gone.G: Any other final comments or concerns?BD: Not really any comments or 
concerns, except to say that it’s important for everybody that’s rep-resented to contact their member of the policy committee to make sure their voice is heard.AP: I don’t want anyone to view this as an administration-versus-students issue. I think that the public-transportation issue faces all of us. It’s something we all use to varying degrees, and varying degrees of reli-ability … I think we just want to see the solution that helps as many people as possible.

APPLY BY MARCH 2!The controversial Superbowl 
ad from Focus on the Family 
fades from a baby photo to a head-shot of Pam Tebow (mother of 2007 Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow), who — with a Botoxed smile — explains how she “almost lost” her son. The ad concludes with uplifting music and a senti-mental scene of Tim hugging his mother, framed by “Pam and Tim Tebow — 2007 Heisman Trophy Winner. ” 
Message: Don’t abort, because 
your uterus could be holding the next Heisman trophy winner.
But what the 30-second spot 
doesn’t tell us is that Tim wasn’t actually an unplanned pregnancy, nor the son of a teen mother: The doctors in the third-world country in which Tebow was conceived thought he was a tumor. Pam’s nurse advised her to “abort” the tumor, stressing that keeping it would put her life in danger. 
Just short of sounding like an 
ad for St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital, Tebow tries to pull the heart-strings of the football enthusiasts across the country. But did she really “almost lose” him? Nearly aborting a child — several times — does not equate to almost losing it.
Tebow said that if god asked her 
to give her life up, “he would take care of [her] family. ” Pro-lifers are, of course, entitled to their views, but sharing only a misleading tid-bit of Pam Tebow’s story does not promote the organization’s cause; it only leaves us furrowing our brows in confusion.

Strolling down Library Walk, it 
always burns a hole through my 
eyes to see pro-life demonstrators deck the walkways with photos of aborted fetuses. But blatant tasteless-ness aside, the message is indeed clear and unavoidable — an eye-catching means of publicizing their cause. 
This time, though, the pro-life 
brigade didn’t make my stomach want to hurl its contents. The scripted dia-logue from Tim Tebow’s mother about how lucky she is to have  kept her son was so vague, I was left wondering if she’ d almost miscarried or if the meaty hulk was once a premee. 
But there’s a reason that we’re left 
scratching our heads after viewing the multi-million-dollar ad: Had Pam whipped out a dismembered fetus and scolded pro-choicers everywhere, we’ d be less be willing to lend an ear to the Focus on the Family campaign. The shift from in-your-face pop-ups to fam-ily-targeted sob stories is — though it may still strike the nerves of pro-choic-ers — a clever marketing decision for the organization. Hey, if they can raise an eyebrow without turning a stomach, they must be doing something right.

   omewhere in 1983 Revelle College alumnus Joshua  
   Har
ris’ collection of life possessions exists a videotape 
              of himself taking a shit. 
                   Lucky for whoever’ s currently bunking in Harris’               second-floor Discovery Hall dorm room, the cam              era that recorded the epic event wasn’t installed in his 
college digs. The footage was taken much later, in a typical moment of Harris’ life work: expensive surveillance projects that push pri-vacy norms to the limit.
That’s not to say Harris didn’t get some practice in shock-value 
entertainment during his five years at UCSD. In Spring Quarter 1981, he was disqualified from the A.S. presidential election for spending 93 cents over his $50 campaign budget. Additionally per-turbed by then-Chancellor Richard Atkinson’s decision to sell the land between UCSD and Black’s Beach, Harris decided he’ d exact revenge by founding fraternity Phi Delta Theta and a little publica-
tion known as the Koala .
“I got ripped off, ” Harris said. “I was so 
pissed off, and I knew that Atkinson did not want fraternities on our campus. So I said ‘well, because he doesn’t want that, I’ll start one. ’ And then, I made the first Koala. I got the money for it, and I got them the office space. ”
Harris was a natural starter-upper. A 
year after graduating in 1983, he moved to New Y ork and got a job at a market-research company. Soon after, he founded Jupiter Comm unications — a company 
that collected data on how people would use media to connect in the future.
Eventually, Harris grew tired of predicting the Internet’s future 
through data reports. In 1994, he tried his hand at a video-chat Web site — a makeshift creation he dubbed Pseudo.com. 
According to 1984 UCSD alumnus Marc Geiger — Harris’ col-
lege buddy and business associate — Harris was a visionary in the dot-com industry, though a little ahead of his time.
“Y ou’ d get two frames, then buffering, ” Geiger said. “ Audio, then 
buffering — and that was the world. Just like a really bad experience you have today when you’re like ‘Shit, I have to reload the page. ’ That was the best experience. ”
Despite technological limits, Pseudo bumped Harris into a 
crowd of young, elite millionaires who ran the dot-com scene in an area of downtown Manhattan dubbed Silicon Alley. 
“In New Y ork or Silicon Valley or Israel or Boston or Seattle, it 
was like bands: Y ou had real scenes, ” Geiger said. “Like the grunge scene in Seattle. Except in Palo Alto, it was Y ahoo and Excite, eBay. Microsoft was up in Seattle. New Y ork had a whole different set of stuff. ”
As money poured in, Harris began throwing extravagant, 
future-themed parties to collect young, creative recruits who would help him build Pseudo. Media orgs flocked to profile the dot-com bubble’s twisted leader, and Harris didn’t hold back. He was known for showing up in creepy clown attire to magazine shoots and cor-porate parties acting like Luvvy, his emotional alter-ego. 
Harris’ bold personality didn’t mesh well with potential inves-
tors though, and as the antics continued, Pseudo began to slip from his grip. The two parted ways in 1999, and with piles of money 
to spend, Harris set his sights on a social experiment he named 
With gobs of money and an appetite 
for chaos, one UCSD alum takes 21st-century voyeurism to the limit.

Cups Organic C upca kes in 
downtown  La Jolla puts  
an entire ly new spin on 
the hip new world of minature 
confections. Made with  sustain -
able, organic ingre dients — with  
gluten -free,  dairy-free  and 
vegan options  — these small 
indulgences aren’t from  your  
gran dma ’s Betty  Cro cker box. 
Flavors  range  from  carame l 
macchiato (espresso -choco late 
batter  toppe d with  mascarpone  
mousse  and carame l sauce) 
to lime-chili-mango  (mango -
batter  toppe d with  lime-chili 
butter  cream) to Zanzibar  chai 
(vani lla-bean  toppe d with  spicy -
sweet chai frosting) — enough  
to satisf
y the even  swan kiest of 
cravings. 
But Cups has more  to 
offer  than  bite-sized desserts  
crowne d in cream caps.  After 
you’ve filled up on cake, perch  
yourse lf on a red viny l stoo l and 
order a coffee  at the espresso  
bar, then  gaze out ont o Girard 
Avenu.
If it all tastes  so good you 
want to sing and dance, the 
store ’s live deejay — statione d in 
the corner — wi ll pause  some  
T.I. to set up the store ’s karao ke 
machine.  Free  WiFi and wrap -
aroun d couches in the back also 
make for a go
od study spot — 
but if you’re easily distracte d, 
bring earp lugs. 
Unsurprising ly, Cups is a lit-
tle pricey: A norma l-size d cup-
cake will cost you $4, mini cakes 
will cost you $2 and drin ks are 
al
most  twice as much  as at the 
Living R oom  down  the street.
And of 
course, d ue 
to its prime  
spot in 
downtown  La Jolla, Cups lacks convenient 
parking, and its small square -
footage  — when  combine d 
with  an over ly zealous karao ke 
s
inger  on her 30-minute l unch  
brea k — gets to feeling pretty  
crampe d. 
Though  the close proximity  
of PupC ups (cupca ke-shape d 
dog treats)  to human  desserts  
in the display case might be 
disconcerting,  Cups is overa ll 
a classy cross between  modern  
lounge,  sidewa lk cafe and candy 
store.
It’s a great  place to go for 
your  birth day, your  frien d’s 
post -brea kup cheer  session or a 
study brea k when  you’re hoping  
to cram all the sugar high you 
can stomach.  At the very  least,  
it’s
 a good casua l-dessert  alter-
native  to ensure you don’t OD 
on fro-yo.

A MODEL IN THE MAKINGfolk
Like so many  girls, Earl Warren  College sophomore  
Monica  Pearce  always wishe d she could be a super -
model. But when  she entere d to win Clinique’s Fresh  
Faces T our, she never  actua lly expecte d to be selected as 
one of three  winners — beating  over 8,000  other  college 
entrants  — an d scoring  a spot in the pages  of Teen Vogue.
“I can’t really explain the excitement I fe lt when  I won, ” 
Pearce  said. “It really is something I’ll never  forget. I t was 
really a once -in-a-lifetime opportunity.  The whole time  I 
was like, ‘Pinch  me, am I 
really here?’” 
Pearce  first notice d the Clinique trailer — par ked across  
from  the Student Services C enter, — when  she saw the 
winding line of girls it had attracte d on Oct. 28. L ooking to 
blow off some  stea m after  midterms,  she decided that a free 
makeover  from  her favorite cosmetics bran d couldn’t hurt.  
After standing in line for an hour  and a half, profes -
siona l stylists preppe d her hair and makeup for 30 minutes,  
and a photographer  took thr ee snapshots  of her. They were  
then  entere d into Cl inique’s Fresh  Faces C ontest.
“They actua lly had a camera  crew, and they hooked up 
a microphone  to me and followed me throughout  the whole 
experience, ” Pearce  said. “That was kind of when  I thought  
th
at maybe  I can  win. I t felt like I was  on a reality TV show … 
I was like, maybe  I shou ld stand up a little straighter. ”
Still, Pearce  was shoc ked when  she learne d on Nov.  19, 
2009 that she had made it into the top 25 girls in the comp e-
tition.  She receive d an e-mail to check the contest W eb site, 
which feature d her picture  among  the finalists. From  there,  
the site stated that online polls — a long with a Teen Vogue  
and Clinique pane l — wou ld deci de the three  winners.  
At fir
st, she only told a few frien ds. But eventua lly she 
began recruiting  the support  of her hometown  community  
in Elk Grove and her sisters  in Delta Gamma.
“On Faceboo k, I up dated my status  every  once  in while, 
asking peop le to vote for me,” Pearc e said. “I didn’t want to 
overdo it and do  it every  day, every  minute. I di dn’t want  
it to be all about  me all the time.  That’s why I thin k my 
frien ds [supporte d me] and were  really happy  for me.”
Pearc
e said she also owes  some  credit to her ethnicity:  
She’s half Chinese and half Irish-Swedish-Scottish,  a mix 
that accor ding to Pearce,  gave her a diverse  look that fit the 
ideals of Clinique’s new “fresh  face” campaign.
“They thought  tha t I ha d a different l ook,” Pearce  
said. “In today’s world, you don’t meet  someone  with  one 
nationa lity; that’s what ’s creating this new fresh  look. No 
one fits a stereotypica l model loo k anymore. ”
The prizes for the three  winners  included a fi ve-day, all-
expenses -paid trip to New  York — comp lete with  tickets to 
“Wicked” and a behin d-the -scenes tour of the Teen Vogue  and Clinique offices. T he girls already participate d in photo  
shoots  in Times Square and the Teen Vogue war ehouse,  
where  they were  glamme d out by makeup artists, hair styl-
ists and outfit  coor dinators.  
Pictures from  the shoots  will appear  as an insert in the 
April issue  of Teen Vogue.
“[The  photo  shoot ] was a really interesting process, ” 
Pearce  said. “I was  the only on e of the two that hadn’t had 
any modeling experience. I di dn’t know how to pose  or do 
any facia l expressions, but they were  really nice and taught  
me how to pose.  I just like to smile though.  I don ’t really like  
to do the whole serious  look. I was  just having  so much  fun.”
With the help of some  lights and bass-heavy  back-
groun d music, Pearce  said she warme d to the shoot.  She 
said her favorite aspect  was trying  on clothes  she could 
be
fore only admire as a subscriber  to Teen Vogue.  
“The stylist who dresse d me for both  photo  shoots  gave  
me some  tips on how to dress,” Pearce  said. “Because  I’m BY JASMINE TASTAFF WRITERMONICA PEARCE

Expires 3/1/10 Prints“Quiet: We Live in Public. ”
He rented out an underground 
bunker in New Y ork City, gutted 
it and filled it with a dining area, a kitchen, a church, a firing range and rows of “pods” (sleeping chambers modeled after those in concentration camps). Surveillance cameras were hooked up in every crevice. Each pod came with a monitor and a camera, so capsule residents could keep tabs on their neighbors. Harris also employed Stasi-like psychologists to interrogate participants and further invade their privacy. Those who volunteered to participate were forced to wear uni-forms and live in the quarters for 30 days. In all, the project cost about $2 million.
The results were frightening. 
People had sex in the shower, crapped together, unloaded powerful firearms, stomped stark-naked — like a march-ing band — on the dinner table and listened to Harris’ cultish sermons at the altar of the “We Live in Public” pseudo-church. The occupants’ energy fluctuated from giddy to angry, impatient to psychotic — that is, until the project was shut down by the NYPD on New Y ear’s Day of Y2K. 
Hungry for more, Harris asked 
his girlfriend, a show host on Pseudo.com, to live with him in a spacious New Y ork loft. The catch? It was wired with loads of cameras — installed in the fridge, the litter box and the toilet, among more obvious places — and 72 hypersensitive microphones. Users watched and chatted with the couple online as if they were close friends.
The invasiveness of surveillance, 
coupled with the dot-com stock-mar-ket bust, ate away at Harris’ relation-ship. Once his girlfriend left him and he’ d gone broke, he fled from the city and bought an apple farm.
Since then, he’s had a number of 
failed projects, and moved to Ethiopia a few years back in search of total isolation — so much isolation, in fact, that even his creditors can’t find him.
While Harris was soul-searching, 
Ondi Timoner — a participant in Harris’ capsule experiment — directed and produced a documentary of the dot-com millionaire’s life, fittingly 
titled “We Live in Public. ” The film won the Sundance Film Festival’s Grand Jury Prize in 2009. 
“I didn’t realize while filming the 
bunker that this was Josh’s physical prediction of how life online would be, “ Ondi Timoner said in the film.
Now, Harris is back in LA, crashing 
in his friend’s pool house while pitch-ing his latest commentary on technol-ogy’s pervasiveness: “The Wired City. ” It’s a cross between World of Warcraft and “The Truman Show, ” and Harris hopes to unleash it upon the public as soon as he can find funds.
Though he’s kept his distance from 
his alma mater during the media journey, Harris says his time at UCSD helped him conceive of his social experiments.
“What I figured out when I was at 
UCSD, I really had a chance to think through everything that I’m manifest-ing right now, ” Harris said. “I dreamed the dream. The fundamental thinking was done there. ”

petite, [he] told me what worked and what didn’t for my body type. ”
As an urban studies and planning 
major, Pearce also said she found the business and marketing aspects of her trip fascinating. At the Clinique and Teen Vogue offices, Pearce conversed with company directors about their products and advertising techniques.
“I got to go behind the scenes of 
Teen Vogue and Clinique, seeing how the companies run and seeing how much effort they put into product and magazine and really how that business is run, ” Pearce said. “It was a side [of fashion] that I’ve never thought about before or seen. ”Pearce met many captains in the 
fashion industry, including the Teen Vogue publisher, health and beauty director and editor-in-chief, as well as the Clinique president of marketing for North America.
“I got business cards form every-
one I met, ” Pearce said. “I’ve been e-mailing back and forth. I even asked about internships, and they were really open to the idea. ”
Pearce is now considering taking 
up a minor in economics — a tip from one of her newfound business contacts — in case she ever decides to pursue a career within the fashion industry. Still, she hasn’t ruled out modeling.
“I’m actually going to put a port-
folio [of my pictures] together, just in case I ever want to model for fun or anything, ” Pearce said. “We’ll see what happens. I’m a student for now, but I’m willing to keep an open mind. ”
After her trip, Pearce also received 
$1,000 toward Clinique products.
“What am I going to do with 
$1,000?” Pearce said. “I let my two friends choose some, as well as my mom and grandma and sister. Even my dad chose out a [bottle of] cologne. They said that it will last a whole year, but I’m probably good for the next five years. ”

Tritons found their shooting range, 
closing the game on an 11-5 run.  Senior guard Jordan Lawley was clutch down the stretch, scoring the final four points of the game.  Lawley tallied his third double-double of the season with 24 points and 10 rebounds.  
The UCSD offense shot 45 per-
cent from the field — just enough to top Stanislaus.
With two straight wins under 
their belt, the Triton men took on Chico. Tied with the Wildcats at half-time, Chico State came out of the break with an offensive firestorm, starting the second half on a 10-0 run. The Tritons couldn’t recover from the deficit. 
After a dominating defensive performance against Stanislaus, the Tritons couldn’t stop Chico’s Roderick Hawkins and Jon Baird, who combined for 25 points.  
After splitting its two games on 
the road trip, Carlson said the team is drawing on the positives to tackle the rest of the season. 
“Overall, it was a successful road 
trip, ” Carlson said. “There is still a lot of basketball to be played this season. ”
The Tritons have five games left 
in the regular season, including three this week. They will play against Cal State East Bay on Feb. 16 at RIMAC Arena, before leaving on another road trip to San Francisco State and Cal State Monterey Bay.

points ahead of Loyola Marymount University.
Tan, one of the freshmen bound 
for nationals, said she was elated at having qualified in the final race of the competition: the women’s 400-yard freestyle relay.
“It is unbelievable making nation-
als, because I just barely missed the cut on my races, ” Tan said. “But I got a last chance with the relay, and my coaches were ecstatic. We won by six points … and were going back and forth all day. ”
Head coach Scott McGihon said 
the team’s last-day heroics were a tes-tament to both their mental strength and wealth of talent.
“We didn’t actually have the race 
won after the third day, ” McGihon said.  “Seattle still had a strong chance. But our performance on the last day just shows our great depth, and that we have a much better competitive atmosphere than anyone else. ”
Henley was UCSD’s top female 
performer. She won four individual events: the 500-yard freestyle, the 200-yard individual medley, the 200-yard butterfly and the 200-yard back-stroke (in which she broke the meet record with a time of 2:00.52). Henley also finished second in the 400-yard individual medley and third in the 100-yard butterfly, behind winner and teammate senior Karla Holman — who took the event with a time of 56.78.
Other top performances for the 
women’s team were sophomore Shea Kopp’s 100-yard backstroke, Shimura’s second-place finish in the same event and freshman Beth Dong’s victory in the 1,650-yard free-
style race.
On the men’s side, senior Daniel 
Perdew won the meet’s first event — the 50-yard freestyle — in typical lightning fashion, and later won the 100-yard butterfly. Senior Juan Pablo Carrillo won the 100-yard breast-stroke and senior Jereme Barnett-Woods won the 1,650-yard freestyle event. Freshman Shaun Stringer finished up the domination for the Tritons as he won the 200-yard but-terfly.
For the divers, senior Danielle 
Niculescu took first in the women’s one-meter diving event with a total score of 235.70 — only 1.65 points ahead of the second place finisher. Freshman Tyler Runsten grabbed first place in the three-meter event and second in the one-meter event.

SWIMMING & DIVING — 
After four days of intense com-petition against some of the West Coast’s premier universities, the UCSD men’s and women’s swim-ming and diving teams emerged as repeat winners of the Pacific Collegiate Swim Conference Championships, held in Long Beach from Feb. 10 through Feb. 13.
“It feels amazing to be a part 
of a championship team, ” fresh-man sprint Amber Tan said. “The competition was fierce, but this team is great for sure. ”
The Tritons swept teams 
from California, Arizona, Washington and Alaska on the climb to their third conference title in four years.
After their dominating performance last weekend, the Tritons will rest and pre-pare for the NCAA Division-II Championships in Canton, OH — the biggest meet of the year — where they will compete against the best teams in the country.
“We’re looking for compe-
tition and trying to race well against strong competitors, ” senior captain Cari Cunningham said. “But you have times to make every meet, and we try to improve on past meets. ”
Going into the weekend, 
22 Triton athletes had already qualified for nationals — four fewer than they sent to last year’s competition. However, due in large part to several outstanding freshmen performances, they emerged from the weekend with 28 national qualifiers. 
While the men’s team won 
its conference by the third day — finishing with 1,535 points and bettering nearest competi-tor Seattle University by 172.5 points — the women’s team went down to the wire with Loyola Marymount University. 
The 400-yard freestyle 
relay team of Tan, junior Anju Shimura, freshman Jessica Ferguson and sophomore Alex Henley finished in second place with a time of 3:27.04, sealing the first place overall victory for the Tritons.
The win was even more sur-
prising considering the Triton women were only in third place after the first day, 60 points beneath Pepperdine University.

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — The No. 
13 UCSD men’s volleyball team was swept by No. 1 Cal State Northridge on Feb. 12 at RIMAC Arena 30-26, 30-26, 30-27.
UCSD leveled the score in each 
set to 20-20, but the Matadors proved the stronger team, claiming all three sets with late rallies. The loss dropped UCSD to 4-8 overall, with a 1-6 record in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.
In the first set, the score was tied 
15 times — the last at 23-23, after a kill from senior outside hitter Jason Spangler. The Matadors scored the next five points to claim a 28-23 lead, before closing the set with a 30-26 victory.
The second set played out much 
like the first. After 14 ties, the Matadors scored five of six points to take a 25-21 lead. The Tritons then rallied back to reduce the Matadors’ lead to 27-25. However, Cal State Northridge eventually took the set 30-26.
In the third set, UCSD led 16-15 
after a kill from junior middle blocker Adrian Guthals. Cal State Northridge fought back to tie the set at 20-20, then scored the next three points by two kills and a UCSD error. UCSD fought back to 26-25, but Cal State Northridge widened the gap to 28-25.
The Matadors claimed the third 
set 30-27. The Tritons hit at .500 in the third set, while the Matadors hit at .486.
Senior opposite hitter Frank Fritsch 
led the Tritons with 17 kills, junior outside hitter Joel Davidson had 11 kills and Spangler contributed 10 kills for UCSD. Sophomore libero Andrew Kaban made a match-high 11 digs, while junior setter Phil Bannan con-tributed 45 assists. Guthals had seven kills on .667 hitting and five blocks.
With no rest for the weary, 
the Tritons faced off against No. 10 UC Santa Barbara on Feb. 13. Unfortunately, they were defeated by the Gauchos 28-30, 33-31, 30-21, 28-30, 16-14. This was the third match of the season that was settled in five sets, with UCSB victorious in the last two. 
With the score tied at 27-27, the 
Tritons grabbed the next two points with a kill from Davidson and a UCSB error. Davidson closed out the set with another kill.
The second set saw 16 ties, and 
neither team held more than a three-point lead at any time. The Tritons led 26-23 after a Davidson ace, but the Gauchos scored four straight points to regain the lead. After UCSD took a 31-30 lead when Bannan pounded a kill after a UCSB overpass, UCSB tied the match again with a block, and a UCSD attacking error handed the 
Gauchos the set.
Despite a .444 hitting percent-
age, the Tritons came up short: The 
Gauchos dominated the third set 30-21.
In the fourth set, UCSD led 
26-20 after a service error from the Gauchos. UCSB fought back within 27-25 before a Spangler kill helped UCSD regain the focus. However, the 
Gauchos did not give up, narrowing 
UCSD’s lead to 29-28.

MEN’S BASKETBALL — In their best 
defensive effort of the season, the Triton basketball players drove home a 56-48 victory over Cal State Stanislaus on Feb. 12. Sadly, it was followed by a 58-42 loss to Chico State on Feb. 13.  
In the first game, the UCSD defense 
held the Warriors to just 30-percent shooting and 48 points — both sea-son lows for a Triton opponent — and allowed only 10 points by the Stanislaus starters. 
“ Any time you can hold a team to 
40-percent field-goal percentage or less, it gives you a good chance, ” head coach Chris Carlson said.
The victory against the Warriors was 
only the second time this season UCSD posted back-to-back wins.  It was also only the second road victory for the Tritons.
Hanging onto a two-point 45-43 lead 
with four-and-a-half minutes left, the

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — After a string of 
blowout UCSD victories, the Chico State Wildcats proved the Tritons are not as invincible as they once seemed. 
The UCSD women’s basketball team split its 
set of weekend road games, crushing Cal State Stanislaus 83-60 on Friday Feb. 12 before falling to Chico on Saturday Feb. 13 by a score of 77-67. The Tritons had won their last four consecutive games by 17 points or more before the Saturday-night dethroning.
There was little doubt of Friday night’s outcome 
from early on: The Tritons started the game on a 
10-0 run, en route to their resounding 23-point vic-
tory over Stanislaus. UCSD held a 42-22 advantage at halftime, and led by as much as 32 points in the second half. 
On Friday night, sophomore guard Chelsea 
Carlisle led scoring with 17 points. Junior forward Tiffany Hunter added 13 points and five rebounds. Overall, 12 different Tritons contributed to the final score in UCSD’s 14th straight win over Stanislaus.
The Tritons forced 24 turnovers that they con-
verted into 27 points.
“Our defense started creating easy offensive 
opportunities for us, which is always our goal, ” head coach Charity Elliott said.
Alisha Kelley scored 17 points to lead the 
Warriors, who fell to 5-16 overall and 4-13 in California Collegiate Athletic Association play.
On Saturday, Carlisle scored 18 points — on top of  17 points and nine rebounds from Hunter, but it was not enough to overcome a night of poor shoot-ing, and the Tritons fell for only the second time this season. The Tritons shot just 32 percent from the floor, and hit only eight shots from the field in the second half.
Chico came out strong and led for the entire 
first half, going into the break with a 38-32 lead. The Tritons rallied and kept the game close, but a 7-0 run with 8:24 remaining gave the Wildcats an eight-point advantage that the Tritons were unable to close. Chico hit its free throws down the stretch, going 8-10 from the line in the final two minutes to seal the win.
Chico was propelled by a career-best night from 
senior guard Melissa Richardson, who scored 26 points on 9-18 shooting. The Wildcats also played well in the post, scoring 30 of their points in the 
paint and out-rebounding the Tritons 51-39.
On top of seeing its six-game winning streak 
snapped, UCSD fell to 20-2 overall and 15-2 in con-
ference play. The Wildcats won their fourth straight game to reach 15-8 overall and 12-6 in the CCAA.
The Tritons will attempt a comeback on Tuesday 
against Cal State East Bay.
“I think we’ve made some great strides and have 
come to realize that you don’t get any do-overs, ” Elliot said. “Every game is important. ”
UCSD will then travel to Northern California 
to play against San Francisco State and Cal State Monterey Bay on Friday and Saturday.
