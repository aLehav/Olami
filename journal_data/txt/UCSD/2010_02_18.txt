An event invitation to a ghetto-
themed party titled “Compton Cookout” has incited outrage 
among black students and supporters on campus, who held a Campus Black Forum on Tuesday night to discuss the issue. The forum was hosted by the Students for Affirmative Action Committee, a coali-tion of diversity-minded campus groups including the Black Student Union. 
The party was held Monday — “in 
hopes of showing respect” to Black History Month — by a group of individu-als affiliated with a number of fraternities; particularly, Pi Kappa Alpha. The event received notoriety when the Facebook event description was published in a note by Revelle College sophomore Elize Diop. The party called for males to 
wear “XXXL ” T-shirts and “stunner shades, ” and for females to dress like “ghetto chicks” in cheap clothing. Approximately 275 students RSVPed as “attending. ”
The matter was brought 
to the attention of Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox and Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny Rue Monday night by e-mails from concerned students. Fox PARTY FOUL

UCSD Libraries are sending out surveys 
to gather student feedback, as they continue to slash library services in light of a 20 percent budget cut in the past two years alone. 
According to 
University Librarian Brian Schottlaender, the budget was reduced by 7 percent in the 2008-09 academic year, and another 14 percent last year, totaling a reduc-tion of over $6 million. Half of these reductions are permanent. 
Library hours have 
been reduced by 12 per-cent in Geisel Library — it now closes at mid-night from Sunday to Thursday instead of 2 a.m. and closes at 6 p.m. on Friday instead of 7 p.m. In addition, the various libraries have cut their book budget by $1.2 million, and have cancelled almost 750 print subscriptions. 
According to Director  of Library 
Communications Dolores Davies, the libraries will use the survey responses to create a new strategic plan for 2010 that includes a mission statement, statement of values and a prioritiza-tion of services and operations. The old strategic 
plan, adopted in 2006, expired last year. 
“ A strategic plan is basically a document that 
sets forth an organization’s mission, goals and 
strategic priorities, ” Davies said.4QJZIZa

Deejays at UCSD’s student-run 
station were dismayed Wednesday 
morning to discover intruders had broken into the KSDT office over-night and stolen at least $1,700 worth of equipment.
The first person to notice the 
break-in was KSDT deejay Andres Fraire, who showed up at 7:50 a.m. to prepare for his 8 a.m. show, “The Omission. ” He concluded that the robbery had taken place sometime after 2 a.m., when a program named “Commitment to Excellence” ended and its hosts went home.
“I went into the studio to start 
my show, and I noticed that every-
thing was missing. Our mixer was 
missing, our speakers _ pretty much everything we have at that studio was gone, even the microphones, ” Fraire said. “ And then I went into the hallway and I noticed our back door had been broken into, that that’s how the thieves had gotten in. ”
According to KSDT general 
manager Meredith Wong, theft is not uncommon at the station.
“This is definitely not the first 
time we’ve been robbed, but this is the first time we’ve been broken into, ” Wong said. “We have problems with our headphones being taken — that’s sort of what a lot of our operating costs go toward, is the cost of replacing equipment that almost systematically goes missing. ”

Scientists have discovered a 
sophisticated form of bee communica-
tion that reveals how honeybees warn each other of danger while foraging for food. 
A team of researchers led by James 
Nieh, associate professor of biology and head of the Nieh Bee Laboratory, has spent the past two years record-ing the communicative behavior of honeybees. They discovered that bees have a specific “stop” signal used to alert other bees to the presence of danger at a food source. 
According to Nieh, this discovery 
complements the knowledge that worker female honeybees perform a “waggle dance” to alert the rest of the hive to the exact location of food.
“We found the anti-waggle dance, ” 
Nieh said. “We discovered that bees actually have a stop signal for danger that tells other bees when not to go to a location to find food. ”When a bee is attacked while visit-
ing flowers to find nectar, it performs a “stop” signal at the site of the attack by pushing up its head and vibrating its tail — at the rate of 380 times a second — for a tenth of a second. 
“This is different from a general 
alarm, ” Nieh said. “It happens at the location where the bee is attacked, and it doesn’t make anything new happen. It just alerts other bees to stop going there to look for food. ”
These experiments were con-
ducted in a laboratory at the UCSD Biological Field. The bee hive was kept within an observational box, in which one glass panel was removed and replaced by a camera that recorded the various reactions of bees to different stimuli.
The bees were 
attacked by natural invaders, pinched and sprayed by various natural pheromones that they found distracting. 
“We compared the behavior before 
and after the stimuli and found that honeybees created this response at the specific food site during the presence of danger, ” Nieh said. 
Nieh said the discovery is impor-
tant because of the implications it has on understanding other organisms. 
“ Animals like bees and ants are 
considered superorganisms because the way their colony works is similar to a multicellular organism, ” Nieh said. “ A colony is the body, and bees are seen as the cells. ”
Nieh said that, 
though superorgan-isms commonly use positive feedback reactions, there are few examples of them exhibiting negative feedback reactions — which occurs when organisms perform an action to stop opera-
tions. For example, a negative feedback reaction occurs when the endocrine system signals the pancreas to stop the production of insulin after low blood-sugar levels reach normal levels.
“This discovery is the most 
advanced example of negative feed-back in a superorganism, ” Nieh said. “I hope that other scientists consider this example as a type of negative feedback that might exist in other organisms. ”
According to Nieh, this discovery 
could also help explain colony col-lapse disorder, or the disappearance of honeybees that began in 2006.
“There’s been so much concern 
about there being less bees to pollinate flowers, ” Nieh said. “This discovery of how they signal when to stop going to a food source could go a long way toward explaining that phenomena. ”
The findings will be published in 
the Current Bio Journal on Feb. 23.

There are nights when an exotic 
new dish — like dosas or sashimi — 
sounds awesome, and then there are the nights when all you want in the world is a taste of Mom’s meatloaf. Psychologists at UCSD have been investigating the reasons behind these choices by analyzing the effects of positive and negative moods on the decision-making portion of the brain.
By understanding the way the 
brain reacts to outside stimuli, psy-chologists hope to find more effec-tive treatments for depression and emotional problems.
Researchers already knew that 
people tend to prefer familiar stim-uli, because repeated exposure to situations or objects creates a sense of security and mental attachment, and repeated exposure to situations or objects will increase the affinity a person has toward it.
According to UCSD 
psychology professor and project leader Piotr Winkielman, research-ers have discovered that familiarity preference depends on whether someone is feel-ing happy or sad at the same time they are being exposed to the familiar or non-familiar stimulus.
“It contributes to a better understanding of our emotions, and that’s a good thing because we want to improve people’s emotional func-tioning, ” Winkielman said. “We want to help people feel less sad, or if they feel sad, we want to help them deal with this. It’s basically a bet-ter understanding of how emotions change our judgments. ”
In the one-year experiment that 
began in 2008, researchers repeat-edly exposed UCSD student par-ticipants to random dot patterns that resembled star constellations. Then, to put the subjects in a good or a bad mood, psychologists asked students to think of happy or sad memories.
With these memories in mind, 
subjects were once again exposed to the patterns, and their emotional and psychological responses were measured through both self-reported ratings and involuntary physiologi-cal indicators of emotion. For exam-ple, skin conductors were attached to the subject’s skin to detect sweat and facial electrodes to detected sponta-neous frowns and smiles. 
As the researchers predicted, 
the subjects who were thinking of 
depressing 
memories demonstrated a preference for the familiar through a higher rate of involuntary smiling. 
By contrast, those who thought 
of  happy moments while viewing the stimuli showed a greater positive response to the unfamiliar, demon-strating that those who were happy preferred novel things and new experiences to routine ones.
This helps explain a wide range 
of social situations, from a consum-er’s decision to buy one product over another, to the way a person forms an impression of their environment and chooses a political candidate, to the understanding of how children develop. 
Given its extensive applications 
from marketing to political cam-paigns to parenting, this knowledge of basic human psychology can give greater insight into our decision-making processes.
“There’s a lot of interest in every-
day persuasion contexts, from trying to help people respond to products or political messages, ” Winkielman said. “ Also, in some clinical contexts, you want to understand how people who are depressive change their preferences for familiar or novel things or people who are manic who have highly positive moods — how they change preferences. ” 
The research team, which also 
consists of graduate student Troy 
Chenier and scientists from 
the University of the 
Netherlands, will continue 
to study how emotions influence how humans 
think, perceive and make 
choices, as well as how these 
processes manifest in the body 
and the brain.

Researchers conclude 
that moods affect choices between familiar and unfamiliar experiences. T he A.S. Council had a lot on 
its hands this week as they discussed the “Compton 
Cookout” event, which ignited racial tension between black students and the Greek community, impeachments and the yet-again proposed revisions to the Loft referendum language.
Newly 
elected Inter-Fraternity Council president Robby Naoufal  
addressed the council and read the official IFC statement regarding the racially themed event that targeted black students during the President’s Day weekend.
Members of the black community 
attended the A.S. meeting, but did not speak about the matter.
Campuswide Senator Bryant Pena  
motioned proposed a committee to draft an effective resolution concern-ing campus climate.
Councilmembers debated for too 
long about the number of representa-tives from council who would serve on the committee alongside the Black Student Union president and the IFC and Panhellenic presidents.
They agreed to prohibit President 
Utsav Gupta  to sit on the committee 
due to fear of too much A.S. oversight. 
UCAB chair and AVP of 
Academic Affairs Jordan Taylor discussed the referendum he drafted to raise the University Centers fee to mirror the Consumer Price Index annual increase.
Taylor’s referendum passed, and 
will go to the Graduate Student Association Monday.
During question time, Advocate 
General Parminder Sandhu asked 
Muir Senator Ryan O’Rear  why 
his three submitted resolutions for removing AVPs from their positions did not pass in committee.
O’Rear said the motions were not 
seconded.
AVP of Enterprise Operations 
Rishi Ghosh presented a resolution 
protecting the political free speech rights of UC stu-dents, citing that a student’s academic life should not be subjected to these beliefs. This comes 
in light of the 11 student protestors arrested at UC Irvine after a demon-stration against Israeli ambassador Michael Oren.
Councilmembers voted to pass the 
resolution.
VP of Student Life Riscie 
Hernandez and Revelle Senator Arvind Satyanarayan  rewrote the 
language of the already-failed-in-council referendum, and councilmem-bers took it to discussion.
Campuswide Senator Katie Hall 
voiced her support for allowing the students to vote on the issue. 
“I vote yes to allow them to vote 
for themselves and to keep this dream alive, ” Hall said. 
VP of Finance and Resources 
Peter Benesch spoke in opposition, “Eighty percent of students who don’t use the Loft are subsidizing for those 20 percent that do use it, ” he said. “It’s not essential; it’s like going to a con-cert venue for free. ” 
After a tense council roll call vote, 
Executive Assistant Heather Lucas 
announced that the Loft referendum, failed again with a 13-11-2 vote.
Warren Senator Alyssa Wing 
ended the meeting on a high note, as she explained her idea of announc-ing a councilmember of the week to “bring a warmth to this council that’s missing. ”+W]VKQT+WVLMUV[:IKQ[\

It’s recently come to my atten-
tion that, in the online world, only the fittest survive — 
meaning the portly wildebeests of the herd (me) will inevitably get trampled by User 12.0 and his gang of network-savvy junkies. 
Everyone’s favorite online dis-
traction used to be a simple blue-and-white screen that symbolized the leap to college coolness — or so I thought. But earlier today, 
I signed onto Facebook to see a 
jungle of iPhone app-like shrub-bery barricading the page’s unfa-miliar borders. Whoop-dee-doo, the Facebook team redesigned the site again — fitting almost enough group invites, status updates and fan clubs in one screenshot to make me minimize Firefox in defeat. Now that I think of it, let’s not forget the weekly spam from hacker-happy predators who change our statuses to something like, “Kelsey Marrujo is … Hey friends, check out this sketcharific link!”
This is not what I signed up 
for. Facebook was just supposed to make me popular with my dorm crowd so I could avoid becoming the girl who eats a Plaza burrito by herself. But what snuck up on me — and probably many more naive freshmen of yesteryear — is that online identities became almost vital to our social recognition. (That doesn’t go for our parents’ generation, which should never, ever resort to playing Farmville … OK, Mom?)
As much as I hate to admit it, 
it’s true. The Internet is making us its bitches. Not only does it pos-sess us to trade valuable homework and outdoorsy recreational time for a few more refreshes of our news feeds (cue Disney villain theme song: “It won’t cost much … just your voice!”). It also traps us in a world that’s kind of real, kind of fake — much like reality TV — forcing us to get to know both the Internet egos of our friends along with their everyday, slightly less glamorous 3-D personalities.
I’ll sacrifice myself for sake of 
example. When my roommate of three years and I get into one of our quarterly bitchfests, I’m never sure when it’s safe to wave the white flag and crawl back into our room. So what do I do? Sadly enough, I check her Facebook status to see if it has a negative or positive connotation. Something about looking forward to tomorrow? I’m in the clear. Something metaphorical about how 
she wants to rip up nearby objects? 
Time to brace myself.
Back in the day of Xanga blogs 
— don’t pretend like you don’t know what I’m talking about — all I had to do was spit some Internet slang (“wtf, ” “lol”) and select an emoticon that best illustrated  my mood to be a 
part of the fun.
 Now, it’s all about projecting 
a whole other image onto a tech-hungry crowd that wants to know whether “It’s complicated” between me and Johnny, or if we’ve finally   The Surf

For the sake of finding another 
reason to party, themes can get understandably ridiculous. 
In our day, we’ve seen Robots vs. Animals, Librarians and Barbarians, Pedophiles and Children, the Church of Fierce and Marie Antoinette, to name a few.
That said, how a bunch of frat 
guys — apparently bored/stoned into ogre-ishly poor judgment one fine 
afternoon in their Regents apartment complex — thought it a clever idea to plan a “Compton Cookout” in honor of Black History Month is completely lost on us. And, frankly, makes us embarrassed we 
share the same campus.
The Feb. 15 event was spread 
between several Regents condos, rec-reating a sort of “ghetto. ” Males were encouraged to wear “XXXL ” T-shirts, and the Facebook invite instructed females: “For those of you who are unfamiliar with ghetto chicks-Ghetto chicks usually have gold teeth … and wear cheap clothes - they con-sider Baby Phat to be high class and expensive couture. They also have short, nappy hair, and usually wear cheap weave … They look and act similar to Shenaynay, and speak very loudly, while rolling their neck, and waving their finger in your face. Ghetto chicks have a very limited vocabulary, and attempt to make up for it, by forming new words … . ”
Event planners even promised 
to serve “dat Purple Drank- which consists of sugar, water, and the color purple , chicken, coolade, and of course Watermelon. ”
In response to the event, a spon-
taneous Campus Black Forum was called on Tuesday. The Thurgood Marshall Room in Price Center was packed with minority students and faculty, along with the few A.S. and Greek representatives brave enough to weather the outrage. Even the likes of Associate Vice Chancellor of Student Life Penny Rue and Associate Vice Chancellor of Student Life Gary Ratcliff showed up.
Above all, students expressed 
hurt. Hurt that a group of boys and girls with no personal experience as a historically oppressed people would find it in its interests to poke fun at economic disadvantage. The discus-sion led to much larger issues of racial misunderstanding and underrepre-sentation on campus, and hurt, of course, turned to anger, trying to find a target, somebody to blame — some admissions committee member who held the key to accepting more black students, or some A.S. councilmem-ber who could pull the plug on out-lets of hate speech under the council’s jurisdiction (read: the Koala ). 
This is an extreme case because 
the theme maliciously links itself to a month meant to represent prog-ress, but racial-stereotype parties aren’t anything new; “South of the Border” is a popular one. It’s also worth mentioning that the defini-tion of “ghetto chicks” is copy-pasted from UrbanDictionary.com. Aside from the obvious moral distaste here, free-speech protection laws — and the fact that the party wasn’t officially affiliated with UCSD — will most likely protect the perpe-trators from harsh formal punishment. For reasons that we should be proud of, a bunch of kids throwing a question-ably themed party do indeed have the “right” to do so.
In addition, no amount of listserv 
tsk-tsking from the chancellors or apologetic press releases from the Inter-Fraternity Council can hope to affect the obvious mental shortcom-ings of the bros in question. Chances are, they’re racist for lack of exposure — not to mention a down-to-Earth schooling in modern-day race rela-tions and how they’ve reformed. We’re all products of our situation. The sad fact is, a mere 2 percent of the UCSD student body is black; the idea behind this particular party was obviously birthed from a lifetime of Lil Jon videos and Dave Chapelle stand-up — with which the dron-ing, hyper-academic Dimensions of Culture reader apparently couldn’t compete.
Satisfying as it would be in pain-
ful circumstances such as these, restricting freedom of press or creat-ing loopholes in admissions are obvi-ously dangerous for other reasons. And even if the A.S. Council balled up and zero-funded the Koala , or the 
administration took the legally risky leap of expelling the students who planned this party, we would have essentially just expelled their misun-derstanding to the outside (and bred resentment in the meantime). The world would still be plagued by their shortcomings. Southern California, in particular, is already rife with rich kids who have never held a conversa-tion with someone on the other end of their privileged humor.
Campuswide Senator Bryant Pena 
has adopted the Compton Cookout and its campus-climate implications 
as his latest pet project. At last 
night’s A.S. Council meet-
ing, he proposed a small 
committee of leaders 
— from the Cross-
Cultural Center, the 
IFC, the A.S. Council and other diversity-centered organiza-tions on campus — charged with taking “concrete” steps to mending racial divisions at UCSD.
But can another bickering board-
room really hope to permeate such a long tradition of ignorance? Plus, as Associate Vice President of Diversity Affairs Jasmine Philips put it, com-mittee members “don’t want, like, thousands of people showing up. ”
There is also some merit to 
Campus Black Forum proposals that students be required to take more multicultural prerequisites, but oftentimes the jargon and tight-assed political correctness of diver-sity academics doesn’t translate the capitalism-locked racial disadvantage and upper-class (mainly white) sense of privilege that ultimately prevents equality and understanding.
So we are inclined to say, at 
the risk of sounding like President Obama, that maybe the adminis-tration can come in and ask the students who planned the event to simply sit down with those that were hurt by it (beer optional). It’s a lot more difficult to maintain the cocky devil-may-care attitude when you’ve got someone who does care staring 
right back at you.
Hurtful stereotyping on this cam-
pus was a problem long before the Compton Cookout. It’s hard to talk about in a way that won’t send righ-teous free-speechers like the Koala  
into a self-important lather. They don’t want to sacrifice their adrena-line rush or sense of power — or, god forbid, their First Amendment right

Anyone who has spent time 
at an A.S. Council meeting is familiar with the routine 
nature of the council’s weekly delib-erations. Barring discussion of some particularly contentious issue (like racist cookouts, for instance), council meetings are, for the most part, free of controversy, consisting primarily of committee appointments, fund-ing allocations, friendly chatter and nitpicky legislative debate — just the kind of thing you’ d expect from your typical governing body. 
Occasionally, however, council-
members are faced with an issue they deem to be too sensitive for discus-sion before members of the public. On two separate occasions this year, a Guardian reporter assigned to cover 
the weekly A.S. Council meeting was asked to leave the conference room after councilmembers voted to close their meeting to the public. Referred to as “Executive Sessions, ” such private meetings are allowed under the coun-cil’s Special Rules of Order, and usu-ally take place when councilmembers wish to discuss “matters of personnel, existing or anticipated litigation, license or permit determination, threat to public services or facilities, labor negotiations, investments, con-tracts or real property negotiations. ”
Admittedly, the Guardian  edito-
rial board initially thought little of these occurrences, due to the fact that such powers were within the council’s right. But earlier this month, mem-bers of the Daily Nexus  — UC Santa 
Barbara’s student-run newspaper — brought to our attention an alarming event that has reshaped our percep-tion of this apparently routine council procedure. On Jan. 27, all members of the public were unexpectedly asked to leave a meeting of the UCSB A.S. Council. The meeting was closed for approximately 90 minutes, after which time councilmembers refused to offer any explanation for the sud-den expulsion of reporters, students and other onlookers — stating only that the discussion revolved around “pending litigation. ”
Assuming that their council had 
committed infractions of the Brown, Bagley-Keane, or Gloria Romero Open Meetings Acts — California state laws requiring legislative bodies to disclose basic information regarding the sub-ject of any executive session — editors at the Nexus  immediately launched a 
legal investigation into the situation. What they discovered, however, was that no A.S. Council at any UC cam-pus is subject to any state-mandated disclosure law. Basically, the UCSB council’s scant description of its recent secretive close- door session was acceptable under state law.  What this incident reveals is the 
extent to which A.S. Councils within the UC system are able to exploit their right to discretionary privacy. Though the student governing bod-ies at California State University and California Community College cam-puses are subject to the legal require-ments of the Gloria Romero Open Meetings Act and the Brown Act, respectively, our own student leaders are inexplicably exempt from either law, allowing for potential abuses of private meetings to occur. 
That’s not to say our own council 
has regularly carried out shady deal-ings behind closed doors. During both of the instances when council-members voted to enter executive session this year and removed our reporter from their meeting, they provided adequate information as to the content of their private sessions, courteously adhering to California’s disclosure laws on a de facto  basis.
As demonstrated by the actions 
of the UCSB council, however, such courtesy is not always exercised. The specific content of that Jan. 27 meet-ing still remains a mystery — but probably has to do with a rowdy retreat whose damages were patched in student fees.
To ensure that such abuses of 
power are avoided in the future, A.S. Councils within the UC System should be made to adhere to state disclosure laws. By reserving the right to hide their proceedings on a whim, councilmembers effectively disinherit the most essential characteristic of any democratic legislative body: trans-parency. With millions of dollars in student fees in their hands, it would be nice to know that our leaders are always accountable for their actions.

Se Habla Españolto be edgy pigs — to give a shit about 
the way it’s affecting those not so lucky to have derived the same sense of jaded snarkiness from life. Racial-humor diehards argue that stereo-types are only funny because they’re true. But there are different extremes; good racial humor is posed in a way that makes fun of racist people. And in the end, there’s just no way one can understand the feeling of being a stereotyped minority without having been there. Even for those minority students that argue they’re personally not bothered by the slurs — that’s really great for them, but their com-fort makes no difference if others still feel uneasy.
The cookout’s humor is purely 
discriminatory, posed by an isolated social class with no real experience being poor or spat on by the system. (Admit it, PIKE — you’re over-whelmingly white and loaded.) Even if planners didn’t mean it maliciously, there’s whole bunch of go-dumb invi-tees snickering at their laptop screens — or Koala  readers who misinterpret 
the satire (in the case that there is some) — who then think it’s OK to be blatantly racist. No wonder there’s no black students here. When the minority population at UCSD is dis-gusted to the point of not wanting to put up with this environment, cheap laughs seem a large price to pay.
No racial topic or slur should be 
off-limits or hush-hush, but it should all be understood; the concept of purple drank is funny, but it’s also a product of a poor-stay-poorer national crisis. If that’s funny to you, you’re lucky. But at least grow the balls to defend your humor, face to face, to someone who’s not feeling it so much.▶ FORUM, MYVTWHNLOPINION THURSDAY , FEBRUARY 18, 2010  THE UCSD GUARDIAN 6 
Dear Editor,
In my humble opinion, the 
UCSD administration’s outrage over 
Pi Kappa Alpha’s recent Compton Cookout is unwarranted. I do agree that such a party was a disgrace to the true meaning of Black History Month, and reflects the general (nonblack) populace’s dismissive, or perhaps even accommodating, attitude toward racial inequality. However, I believe that the adminis-tration needs to take a step back to gain some perspective on the issue. 
Fraternities throwing offensive 
and obscene parties is a hallmark in the long legacy of college Greek life. Y outhful rebellion has long included participation in culturally inappropriate activities, such as pretending to know anything about the “ghetto, ” the real condition of American poverty, or the people who struggle every day to make ends meet.
Obviously, PIKE is made up of 
entitled young W ASPs who just want to get fucked up and have fun. Instead of protesting some insig-nificant fraternity’s barbecue bash, I believe that concerned UCSD administrators should focus their attention on real problems that the student body can endeavor to change. We, as a generation, see how the American political system is failing due to outdated biparti-sanship. But instead of encouraging the student body to come together to protest and make real change, the administration has resorted to sending e-mails condemning inap-propriate frat parties. Grow up, UCSD.

stabilized our relationship. 
Fortunately for the world, not 
everyone has the 
time and energy to keep pace with every little revolutionary update. I, for one, have yet to succumb to random “Fan Page” invites, even when everyone’s notifications keep popping up to inform me — and the rest of the Facebook popula-tion — that my RA from Matthews has encountered a lonely black sheep on his land. Well, good for him. Now he can brag to his virtual neighbors about it, kill one of his virtual livestock animals 
and have a virtual feast.
We signed up for 
Facebook to make friends in a new place, but instead of becom-ing more outwardly social, some of us now rely so heavily on online networking that we’ve become nocturnal her-mits. 
It’ s cool to be a part 
of the online community, and I have to admit that 
being able to keep track of people — a Facebook-friendly euphemism for “stalk” — through tagged photos is quite a perk. But Facebook and its sister apps keep adding every possible combination of new feature (think 2011: Facebook’s virtual Taco Tuesday, complete with friends’ ava-tars in your bar of choice) to keep us hooked. And it’s getting a little too virtual for me. I’m not saying I’m about to forgo my online ego and completely slip off the radar, but maybe I’ll try to skip the login every once in awhile and take up a good noseful of real-live La Jolla fog. Because even the most intro-verted of UCSD nerds know how to enjoy a good beachside stroll — whether it’s “socially dead” turf or not.

Dear Editor, 
In response to the Feb 12. article 
“Israeli Visitor Draws Crowd, ” the  
Guardian  failed to report on the 
introduction that was given by Peter 
Cowhey, Dean of the UCSD School for International Studies and Pacific Relations. In it he remarked that what he deemed to be “disrespectful” questions would result in criminal proceedings as well as academic repercussions. Upon trying to find the section of the video where this was said, I found that it had been edited out by UCSD-TV . It is appall-ing that UCSD-TV would cut this section (that had tremendous impact on the conduct and mood of the audience) from its broadcast, but it is far more appalling that such threats would be made in the first place.
This is supposed to be a univer-
sity where free speech is protected and encouraged. Students should never have to deal with the threat of academic repercussions as a result of their political activity.
I would hope that UCSD-TV 
releases the full and unedited version of the event as soon as possible as to avoid negative publicity for alleged censorship.

Hi Thai into an enclosed area that connects to KSDT’s back door, then smashed the glass to get in. 
“Part of me thinks it’s kind of funny, 
because they climbed down through the roof and smashed the back door window, and there are so many other windows that are more easily acces-sible, ” Wong said. “Maybe they thought it wouldn’t be locked from down there. ”
Wong said that, though KSDT 
staff members are still attempting to take inventory of remaining equip-ment, they have already confirmed that microphones, speakers, a mixer and a phone patch were stolen.
KSDT will be off the air until 
Monday, when Wong hopes to have assembled some old backup equipment. Until new equipment is purchased, dee-jays will be unable to take phone calls and forced to rely on old technology.
“We have an extra deejay setup 
that’s enough to put on shows, but we’re going to still have to make some replacements, ” Wong said.
The police are currently investigat-
ing the robbery. According to Wong, KSDT plans to increase its security measures to prevent similar incidents from reoccurring. 
 “I’m much more concerned with 
people seeing KSDT as a safe place than finding the criminal and serving justice, ” Wong said.

via a blog on the library Web site, white boards in the library lobby and meetings with faculty, students and administrators. 
Davies said that the survey is 
meant to collect feedback on how the library can better serve students and which services are most important to them in the face of continuing budget cuts.
Laura Chipps, manager of the 
information desk and periodicals at Geisel, said the budget cuts have affect-ed employees across the board. 
“I’ve been here for a long time, ” 
Chipps said. “I’ve seen many budget crises, but none as severe as this one. ”
She said that 40 staff positions 
have been left unfilled or eliminated, although there have been no lay-offs or resignations from the staff. Current employees are now respon-sible for these job duties. 
“It’s just more stressful for us over-
all, ” Chipps said. “People are start-ing to retire, and as their places are vacant, the burden of responsibility is placed down [on] the rest of us. ”
Schottlaender said that while 
there is no way to project future budget cuts, the book budget and vacancies would be the first services to be evaluated.  
“Push come to shove, we’ d look at 
our collections budget and see what we can trim from that, ” he said. 
In addition, Schottlaender said that 
there are currently many staff vacan-cies in the circulation and transaction areas, and that the library will look into consolidating these positions instead of hiring more employees.  
Davies said that, depending on 
the severity of budget cuts, the librar-ies may be forced to cancel more journal subscriptions and further reduce hours of operation next year.
The libraries are collecting input 
through the end of Winter Quarter.

TO GET THESE GREAT OFFERS!and Rue sent out a mass e-mail early 
Tuesday morning condemning the party as “a blatant disregard of our campus values. ”
“ As soon as we realized it was 
not a hoax, we worked to respond as quickly as possible, ” Rue said.  
Students attending 
Tuesday’s forum said they were not directly targeting the fraternity, but were more concerned about the lack of awareness about diversity on campus. Currently, less than 2 percent — or 200 of the campus’ 22,000 under-graduate students — is reg-istered as black.  
According to Warren 
College junior Cierra McCoy, the party is only a symptom of the lack of campus diversity. She said that black students not only have low acceptance and yield rates, but also low retention rates, as many of them eventually want to transfer due to racism at the university.  
“There’s all this talk about improv-
ing student life, ” McCoy said at the forum. “Well, this is my student life. I don’t give a damn if the National Guard has to walk me to my bio class, I will make them do it, and I will not transfer, and I will graduate. ” 
Other forum attendees, such as 
A.S. Campuswide Senator Bryant Pena, called for the expulsion of the individuals involved in planning the party.  
However, Rue said that it is 
unlikely that the university will take direct action against these students.   
“I do not believe there will be pun-
ishment as this still falls under the pro-tection of free speech, ” she said.  
She said the university would 
focus on diversity campaigns instead. 
“I believe the best way to respond 
to this type of speech is more speech, since it’s our collective voices that show the resilience of the San Diego community, ” she said. 
Both Director of Student Life 
Emily Feinstein — who is also the Inter-Fraternity Council adviser — and Director of Student Involvement Emily Marx said the event was nei-
ther funded nor sponsored by a fraternity.   
“The only fraternity 
link this has is that some of the organizers were Greek-affiliated, ” IFC president Robby Naoufal said. “We can’t control the conduct of our members every moment of the day. They do act on their own. ”  
Marx agreed.“We found out that it is 
individuals who did this — that it was multiple mem-bers of the same [apartment complex], and not fraterni-ty-sponsored, ” she said.
However, Feinstein said 
the university is meeting 
with the individuals involved — whose named have not been released — and that various Greek organizations will work with local and national chapters to educate them about the incident.   
 “I will do everything in my power 
to rehabilitate not just the Greeks, but [to] try to empower the entire com-munity, ” she said.
Campuswide Senator Tobias 
Haglund, who is also a member of the IFC, denied allegations, — including Diop’s — accusing PIKE of being a “white frat” .   
“That is absolutely false, ” he said. 
“We pride ourselves on our diver-sity. Whoever made the comment was rightly upset and emotional, but PIKE is not a white frat. ” 
PIKE issued an official statement 
today denying association with the Compton Cookout and condemning the party.  
Students also used Tuesday’s 
forum as an opportunity to speak out against controversial humor newspa-per the Koala . They cited the most 
recent issue — which ridiculed the Jan. 12 earthquake that devastated Haiti — as well as past issues that have repeatedly used the word “nig-ger. ”
According to Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Student Life Gary Ratcliff, the cookout and Koala  con-
tent are both representative of preju-dice on campus.  
“The Koala  is the journalistic 
equivalent to an arsonist, ” he said. ““It gets pleasure from the terror of others. ” 
Ratcliff added that he would sup-
port withdrawing funding from the publication, though a recent A.S. pro-posal to alter media guidelines was unsuccessful.
“For 10 years I’ve seen cycles of 
Koalas injure students, ” he said. “I’ve worked with leaders to set up meet-ings about this issue. A courageous group went to the A.S. [Council] to talk about it, but [the council] got cold feet. ”    
A.S. Associate Vice President of 
Diversity Affairs Jasmine Phillips said the university constantly marginaliz-es minorities; for instance, by asking the BSU to pay for its own yield pro-gram, which is designed to encourage minority students to graduate.  
“The administration expects our 
organization to [shell out] for the yield [program] when  it’s their prob-lem that they should be working on it themselves, ” she said. “We can’t just keep planning — something needs to happen. ”
 In response to the recent upset, 
administrators are launching a diver-sity campaign called “Not in Our Community, ” and will be holding a teach-in on Feb. 24 from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. in the Price Center East Ballroom.

Doe-eyed and whimsically French, 
Aurélia Thierrée has fallen down a rabbit hole into 
the fantasyland of acrobatic illusions. “ Aurélia’s Oratorio” is a topsy-turvy dream-world that would make Alice smile. 
In just 70 minutes, 
Thierrée trapezes over circus acts while still leveraging a Barnum and Bailey feel to create a kid-friendly spectacle. The only problem is that her world is cute at best. Somewhere between its vaudeville yore throwback and trapeze act, the show falls flat. It’s sort of like when two red splotches on a canvas look like nothing special, and  yet, cost millions. 
Still, its foray into circus nouveau makes Thierrée’s abstract and practically dialogue-void performance an amusing new way to look at the world. 
Irrespective of the 
show’s own merits, per-formance is Thierrée’s birthright. She boasts a pedigree that’s hard to match, a punch of cred-ibility for the show. The great-granddaughter of playwright Eugene O’Neil, Thierrée strays far from his trademark 
realism, indulging instead in a purely imag-inative dreamscapes where clothes come to life. What she does inherit in “Oratorio, ” though, is the pantomime of silent film pioneer Charlie Chaplin, whom she is privileged to call Granddaddy. Similarly, Thierrée’s own parents have 
left an imprint on performance history, and it was in their surreal world of travel-ing circuses that she discovered her own calling as early as age three, touring as a walking suitcase entertainer. Jean-Baptiste Thierrée and Victoria Thierrée Chaplin (incidentally, the director of “Oratorio”) started the world-renowned Le Cirque Imaginaire and Le Cirque Invisible, prec-edents for the more flamboyant Cirque du Soleil. 
Inspired by medieval drawings that 
depict the world upside down and inside out, “Oratorio” is a tightrope act that bal-ances nonsensical images with large-scale dance numbers and a swiveling stage. The paradoxes that flood the production give rise to a distinct dimension where kites fly people, ice cream is scalding hot and feed-

RevengeIn Wonderland

Picture this: Kim Kardashian appears on 
TV speaking Shakespearian. Ridiculous, right? Y et it probably wouldn’t do much 
to the very basic plotline of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians. ” If anything, maybe you’ d relate to the old bard a bit more. At least, that’s what director of this week’s Potiker Theatre headliner Christopher Ashley thinks.
For his newest creation, he decided to 
place his version of “The Revenger’s Tragedy” — a Jacobian play by Thomas Middleton — in the context of reality television. Maybe it seems implausible that the 400-year-old piece could be translated into a decade-old medium, but turns out the Italian court — with all its backstabbing and power play — is perfectly suited to reality television’s heightened egos and risqué affairs. Think of the engrossing “Tragedy” as The Real World: Bard Basics. 
And it’s just as addicting as the real thing. Vindice is out to avenge the death of 
his fiance, who was murdered by the Duke when she denied his advances. With the help of his brother, Hippolito, Vindice infil-TRACKREVIEWS
‘Me and the Devil’
Gil Scott-Heron
XL RECORDINGS5

The track throbs with distorted bass as the hero swears revenge to an uncaring sky. Politicized flows like “The Revolution Will 
Not Be Televised” might have earned Gil Scott-Heron the title Godfather of Rap, but the twisted synths in blues number “Me and the Devil” sound more like “Sin City” than 50 Cent. His voice ripped apart by age and cheap whiskey, Scott-Heron croons over a heavy backbeat until the fallen hero chambers a round for his revenge — then it’s over. What Scott-Heron has crafted is genuinely disturbing, but there’s no climax to break the track open. Y ou’ll have to pick up the album to find out how this cliffhanger ends.

ISLAND RECORDS4

AChex Mix of cliche, formulaic song struc-ture and tired lyrics, Etheridge’s “Fearless Love” rides her powerful voice all the way 
to Alzheimer’s. The plodding drums and annoy-ing synth are a humdrum throwback to Alanis Morissette and every other female phoenix who rose above her ex-boyfriend’s abuse. Needless to say, “Fearless Love” is a step down from the raw power of her “Piece of My Heart” cover and the honesty in breast-cancer survival anthem “I Run for Life. ” The track was made for hardcore fans or people with poor pattern recognition: If every Nicholas Sparks story seems original to you, wait until you hear the lows this song goes.

In their latest single, Los Campesinos! draw upon their typical grab bag of instrumenta-tion to create a melting pot of unhinged 
guitar solos and energetic medleys. The ironic “Romance is Boring” boisterously replicates the entertainment of the best of the group’s earlier work. Irreverent and cheeky lyrics uncage the track’s breezy energy, stopping only for the occasional emphatic chorus, rau-cus vocals juxtaposed with the banal scene described.
Catchy and concise, Los Campesinos! exude 
a bottomless energy, just beginning to hit their stride.

POTIKER THEATREFEB. 11-FEB. 20
Making up for a quiet start to the quarter, the Che 
Cafe has just crammed its lineup full of everything 
underground, including space-rockers Tera Melos 
this Saturday. Be warned: One minute the guitar will ﬂoat along in a pure lullaby, only to jerk you awake when the band switches to a spastic freak-out, leaving you breathless before gliding back into nod-off melodies. Don’t bother dancing, but grab yourself a patch of ground to sit down and uncork your brain — with all the high-ﬂying decibels that they’ll pack into the cozy Che, you won’t ﬁnd better spirit-guide gurus than Tera Melos.

H[WHQVLRQXFVGHGXVSUHHKitchen-sink dance bands 
like Errors hit you the only way they know how, 
by teasing genres into an indie rave potpourri. Even with more fingerpicked post-rock and mellow breakdowns than Holy Fuck, nothing on Come Down With Me  will mindfreak 
you to the point of hanging upside-down in Times Square. Still: 8-Bit, ambient, noise, italo disco, electro — all down. 
First banger of note is “ A 
Rumour in Africa, ” the stut-tering, intricate single glued together by a vocoder-melting yell that sounds like a mech-elephant in a sexy virtual safari. This exotic aural cut gives way to the Ladytron part-deux of “Supertribe, ” a clean, electro world with less outside genre influence, then slides into the minor-key minimal “ Antipode” , an emo-teen gamer theme with tinges of American Football. 
After the breathy No Age 
ambience of “The Erskine Bridge, ” shit gets heavy: “Jolomo” robocops back to the reliable electro pulse that Errors seems to favor, gradually add-ing synth quirks until you’re sassified. Closers “The Black Tent” and “Beards” gobble more Afro-guitar licks and drum hits, more math-rock signatures, more of everything gourmet until you’re stuffed like a Bellagio buffet. 
The album reads like a 
bits-of-hits mix tape, lassoing subgenres until they’re bound together in a well-researched and diverse album. One word of advice, though: Y ou gotta pick your favorite colors, dudes, otherwise it starts to sound like brown.

Nneka
Concrete Jungle
YO MAMA’S RECORDING CO.6
10
Given her soulful, con-
scious vocals and her ability to spit a rhyme or 
two, it’s easy to write off neo-soul/ hip-hop artist Nneka Egbuna as a Lauryn Hill copycat, even if she’s emerg-ing from the concrete jungle a decade after the misedu-cated Fugees member made it big. But a couple listens to the Nigerian-born artist’s U.S. debut album Concrete Jungle  
will reveal that — at key  moments — Nneka’s delivery can reach past Hill’s.
While Hill was the queen 
of versatility, perfecting soul, R&B, hip-hop and jazz in her own modern combo, Nneka blends these musical catego-ries and adds a touch of her African roots on each track. Nevertheless, she manages the task with a lot less finesse than Hill. 
The album kicks off with 
one of the few tracks Nneka spits on — her sing-song fluid flow shines on “Showin’ Love, ” topping a haunt-ing organ production from fellow German musician DJ Farhot. From the start, Jungle screams lessons at us: 
“Repentance, acceptance, this is what I plead/ To practice the things we say and tell others in need. ”
In ultra-intimate “Mind 
vs. Heart, ” Nneka replicates the wiry pipes of Erykah Badu. But her voice gets twisted on single “The Uncomfortable Truth. ” The singer’s raspy vocals cut through fat horns and a highly percussive beat through handclaps, shakers and an extremely present drum set.
DJ Farhot and Nneka 
fuse together effortlessly on  
breakout, “Heartbeat, ” where a tinkering piano fades in atop a steady kick. Nneka stutters a catchy hook to the beat of bass drum, playing heartbeat to the track’s con-templative message.
Nneka’s clearly got vocal 
chops, but she’s nowhere near as polished as Hill in her heyday. On heartfelt acoustic ballad “Come With Me, ” the 28-year-old takes the loosely structured track and runs with it, flirting with some off-key detours along the way. And while her few smooth raps help give Jungle 
variety, they lack raw pas-sion. 
Still, it’s not hard to see 
why Nneka is racking up fans in Africa and Europe. If her recent collaboration with the Roots is any indication, America’s about to take a trip down memory Hill real soon.

Spits Soul Over Unstable Beat
trates the Duke’s palace in disguise and 
begins wreaking havoc among the roy-als. Adultery and murder run rampant, and Vindice is determined to bring the bloodline down, at any cost. Though the story reads as little more than a creative mash-up of Shakespearian characters and themes, it functions flawlessly in this production. With a familiar plotline, modern setting and language that rolls right off the actors’ tongues, the play is digestible for all. 
While each character ties the ensem-
ble together, the cast standout is third-year masters of fine arts student Ross Crain, who captures both the comedy and repellant ego of modern celebrities in his role as Lussurioso, the Duke’s son. 
But the real accolades go to the 
designers of “Tragedy” which, like the cast, is made up entirely of UCSD stu-dents. Seven digital video cameras are employed onset, in addition to those the television crew carries onstage. The footage from these cameras is displayed in real time on four set televisions and two scrim projections, allowing the audi-ence to see the production of the play and consume it as a reality show. The camerawork is masterfully planned and executed, and the marriage between film and theater alone makes this play a must-see.

FILMREVIEW
By Neda Salamat
Staff Writer
It’s post-WWII and as vets across the coun-
try mass age their sc ar tissue, U. S. marshal 
Teddy D aniels (Leonardo 
DiCaprio) is ferrete d to an 
alcatraz-esdque island off 
the coast of M assachusetts 
to loc ate the whereab outs of 
escaped patie nt-mu
rderer 
(Emi ly Mo rtimer). Partnered 
with  the ever-revere nt Chuck 
Aule (Mark Ruffalo),  Daniels 
embar ks on i nvestigation into 
the bowels of As hecliffe peni-
tentiary. But he also has a second ary motive: to 
find the man who murder
ed his wife (Michelle Williams) and disappeare d on Shutter  Island. 
Aptly nightmari sh, writer L aeta K alogridis’ 
adaptati on of D ennis Lehane’s novel throws 
plot twist after plot twist into a film glittering  
with  cinemat ograph y. And l iterature buffs will 
appre ciate the amp le 
foreshadowing subtly 
littere d throughout the 
film. Like the psychiat-
ric treatme nts practiced 
on the island, the film is 
boldly unco
nventional 
and never fails to shock. 
Slow to start, 
“Shutter  Island”’s bruta l 
opening sc ene eviscer-
ates introduction niceties, leaving a noticeably 
ill-fit melodramatic sco re in its wake. The  script is quick to recover though, as dir ector Martin 
Scorsese’s skill shines through the dementia, 
when Daniels realizes that there  is somethi ng 
peculiar occurring behi nd the iron-laden walls 
of Asc hecliffe. Repeate dly thwarte d by ever-
present head-shrink D r. Cawley (Ben King
sley), 
Daniel’s lucidity falls to pieces faster than the 
hurri cane-striken island that surrounds him.
Heavyweight DiCaprio once  again earns his 
acting stripe s as the hyper-para noid Daniels,  
demonstrating a range of em otional complex-
ity that keeps us tremb ling with  aftershocks 
long after the credits have  rolled. No t to be 
outshone, Ruffalo and K ingsley also k eep the 
blood pu
mping in their s upporting roles. 
Demonstrating a thorough knowledge of 
Donn ie Darko-type absurdity, “Island’s” g raph -
ics team  drenches their actors in gallons of rain water, burns them  alive and showers them  with 
petals. The  gru
esome and ghoulish is coupled 
with  the etherea l and romantic in elaborate 
dream  sequenc es, blurring the lines betwee n 
sanity and madness. The  violence and death,  
typified by horrific flashbacks to frozen piles 
of
 Holoc aust corpses, while discomforting, is 
never exaggerate d to the level of h orror movie 
gore. 
Although “Island”’s s uccess comes as no s ur-
prise due to past hits “The  Aviator” and “ The 
Depa
rted” (also D iCaprio/Scorsese works), the 
film has much more to it than the trailers sug-
gest. Like in any good S corsese film, be ready 
to cons ume  a heap  of s ociopathi c chara cters, 
a monster of a  plot twist and a sizable helping 
of East Coast drawl. Just be sure to check yo ur 
sanity at the door.

milk is kosher. A mouse scampers across the stage with a dead cat in tow, while Aurélia’s lullaby is the rat-tling of alarm clocks, and roses go into a vase bud-down, stem-up.
“Oratorio’s” attempt at ingenu-
ity comes to the forefront in the most memorable  of its scenes when 
Aurélia finds herself behind a lace curtain, made of lace herself. As if in Eden, she muses beneath a tree until a lace snake comes along and she loses her leg. Swiftly, she pulls out her knitting needles and sutures herself back up. Aurélia then plays Ann Darrow to a King Kong of lace, who cradles her and then dies in a lace blizzard in an attempt to save her.  
What this pastiche of juxtaposi-
tions and random tidbits amounts to is left ambiguous by the lack of a coherent storyline. The only appar-ent motif is dancing partner Jaime Martinez’s reappearance as a man (or perhaps, a lover) in search of the mischievous Aurélia. In some of the performance’s most enchanting moments, Martinez bends forward onto the stage with Aurélia’s red pumps in place of gloves, danc-ing to salsa music. Later, Martinez transforms into a brilliant mari-onette puppeteer, who is dragged across the stage and beaten up by a floating coat.
Far from seamless, the magic 
tricks in “Oratorio” are, for the most part, readily transparent. But the point is not to decipher how the tricks are done. Thierée lets slip just enough for us to realize that there’s a ladder behind the curtain and, more explicitly, that there are dummy limbs in her opening act. Instead, “Oratorio” invites us to a make-believe world with the airy tunes of a Y ann Tiersen-esque soundtrack. We don’t quite get caterpillars smoking hookahs and puffing vowels, but Thierrée’s world certainly is a wonderland of sorts.
▶ ORATORIO, MYVTWHNLFrenchie Wows on the TrapezeI’m gonna be honest here and say that the request for this week’s column has been a little more 
than awkward. I don’t have anything to really say, since nothing’s really been going on in my head besides my personal and professional (read: academic) life. But, having just fin-ished drawing my latest strip, I figure that, since Critical Hit! is essen-tially a comic column these days, I should talk a little about my own comic, Sunny-Side Up, and how it came to be.
Sunny-Side Up is basically a boy-
meets-girl story, and it’s designed 
to be just as tumultuous as those meetings can typically be. It’s sort of pseudo-autobiographical only in the sense though that I, like a lot of other guys in this world, met a girl that rocked my world. I just happened to be one of the few that decided to detail those events in the form of a story. So, the comic is essentially my series of unfortunate events, because they’re the only ones I’m familiar with.
From the get-go, the story was 
never really designed to be very happy. Like life, it’s supposed to be bittersweet. The arc that it’s in right now was where I’ve always wanted the story to end up when I first started writing it, as it was the only thing I could ever think about. I admit that the point was to be unabashedly self-pitying. I mean, the way I saw it, I didn’t want to be held back by rejection and embar-rassment forever, and I figured the best way I could ever get over it was by publicizing it. Hence, the birth of the comic.Here’s the thing: whether any 
of us would like to admit it or not, we all want to feel significant. We all have something to say, and we’re always looking for ways to be heard. I’m no different. I had just been stripped of my dignity, and, dammit, I wanted someone to fuck-
ing listen to me. I wanted to bitch and moan — I wanted to be pitied. But since everyone has their own problems to worry about, nobody really 
gives a shit. Not even friends. So what’s a guy to do? Obviously, make everyone else care.
Fiction, I’ve come to realize, is 
basically one of the many ways of making a lot people care about trivi-al shit, mostly personal. I’ve learned that, if you make your problems sound interesting enough, chances are, people are going to listen. So the tricky thing about fictionalizing my own personal events was trying to make them interesting. Y ou can’t just start with the drama — that’s stupid. Y ou have to ease into it. Y ou gotta make the people care about your characters first. Then, as soon as they’re getting cozy with them, you start taking it up a notch. Once you have them in a good place, BANG! Y ou kick ’ em in the ass with the dramatic tension. It’s what I did with the comic.
I started writing the story Winter 
Quarter of last year; I decided that I was gonna end it Spring Quarter of this year. This gave me five quarters to tell the story. I spent the first two quarters trying to get people inter-ested in the characters or, at least, to give people a reason to look forward to it every week. I mean, I under-stand that there are some  consistent 
readers in the school, so I figured the continuity of the story would be their little treat. Once the third quarter rolled around, Fall Quarter of this year, that’s when I started cranking it up a notch. I got it to be super sentimental.
The point of the overt sentimen-
tality was to exaggerate the emo-tions. If the emotions were exagger-ated enough, then the drop would feel just as significant. That’s the idea, anyways. I wanted people to feel that uneasy, cutesy feeling that they so despise so that, when it’s at its most dispicable, I can fuck it up and really make people care. The goal was for people to pity these characters.
That’s about what’s happen-
ing now. Or supposed to be, any-ways. To be honest, I’m significantly less angsty than I was a year ago, and, actually, sorta resent drawing it. The only reason I still do it is to prove that I can commit to some-thing. I mean, I still think it’s kinda cool. But I’ d really like to be done with it and move on. I dunno, my opinions on it are up in the air.
I will say, though, that the comic 
is supposed to be hopeful. I mean, it’s not so obvious now, since it’s at a very shitty place, but it was never supposed to be just bitter. Like the title, it’ s supposed to be very “Look on the bright side. ” It still has a quarter and a half to go, and, in that span, I want both those characters to come out of it being very different people. For better or worse. That’s sorta how it is in real life anyways, so why shouldn’t my cutesy, fictional characters be any different?
I have nothing more to say. If 
you want to follow along with the story, you can catch the comic in its entirety at www.PHRHIEDOM.com.

FILMREVIEW
By Rebecca Erbe
Staff Writer
Paul Bettany is currently all up 
in the box office — he’s starring in two films at the moment. 
Chances are, you’ve only heard of “Legion, ” and that’s beyond unfortunate. “Legion, ” his big-budget apoc-alyptic-angels flick, has turned out to be an underwhelming bust, but “Creation” — an ode to Charles Darwin — is drawing a small, but intrigued, audi-ence.
Truthfully, “Creation” definitely 
isn’t for everyone. Bettany stars as British naturalist Darwin, but this isn’t the young explorer setting out for the Galapagos you learned about in biol-ogy, nor the grandfatherly figure pre-siding over modern science. Bettany’s plays the Darwin that evolved from one to the other in the intermedi-ate 20-plus years between his HMS Beagle  excursion and the release of 
On the Origin of Species . 
This Darwin 
is fraught with both anxiety about the death of his eldest daughter and how his theory will alter the world. He is constantly con-cerned that his 
deeply religious wife will be destroyed when he releases his findings and “kills god. ”
Eventually, Darwin’s research turns 
against him as he blames himself for his daughter’s death: She was the genetically weak product of a union between first cousins. By the end of “Creation, ” our brilliant evolutionary pioneer is mad with grief, talking to ghosts and refusing to work at all. 
Bettany plays his role with humble 
perfection. While the pace of the film is decidedly slow and pastoral, he brings a quiet intensity to each scene as a man broken by his own intel-lect. Even notoriously stony Jennifer Connelly, Bettany’s on- and offscreen wife, shines as the tightlipped and pious Mrs. Darwin. 
An intimate look into the reclusive 
existence of a legendary figure in the scientific world, the story is told with surprising alacrity and intelligence, continuously reminding us that Darwin’s ideas transformed society’s concept of religion. 
Historical drama is a genre that 
often struggles to find an audience, with the exception of epic money holes like “Titanic” and “Gladiator. ” But if you have the attention span to follow a film without explosions or gratuitous nudity, then you can do no better than “Creation. ” This film’s subtle majesty will satisfy most well-trained palates.

in the past. Maybe a little zen and 
spring sunshine is all CC and Captain Jeter need to remain world champs.
2. The Dodger divorce court.I sure as hell don’t envy the PR 
guy who has to sit down all those diehard Dodger fans and explain why Mommy and Daddy are getting a divorce. This winter, Dodgers owner Frank McCourt and his wife Jamie went through a very public divorce. The clincher? Jamie also happens to be the team’s CEO. As a result, Dodgers’ ownership was neck-deep in litigation, ignoring the team’s glar-ing need: improving its mediocre pitching staff. All the Dodgers needed was a solid offseason  to seriously 
contend for the NL pennant. Instead, LA enters spring training  with zero 
upgrades and a sad farewell from its 2009 ace pitcher. I wonder if McCourt will have to pay  alimony to help keep 
Manny in a clean pair of diapers.
3. The Cuban capitalist.The biggest headliner out of 
Cuba since Elian Gonzalez is Aroldis Chapman, the left-handed defector with a 100-mph  fastball. Chapman 
left his native country over the summer and established residency in the income tax-friendly nation of Andorra before inking a $30.25 million, six-year contract with the Cincinnati Reds in January.
The 22-year-old Cuban phenom 
has the chance to boost a rotation that also features the young and promising Homer Bailey, Edinson Volquez and 
Johnny Cueto — making Cincinnati a possible sleeper pick in the NL East. 
4. MLB ain’t recession-proof.More so than in any spring 
training prior, this year, there are numerous All-Stars out of work and searching for a job. Normally, each spring has a few over-the-hill play-ers or aging stars who wait until the middle of spring to sign with a new team, but this year’s AARP strag-glers include players in their prime who are coming off solid seasons. Although Johnny Damon can keep blaming his unemployment on Scott Boras’ insanity, the fact that he is still without a team would have been unthinkable even just three months ago. Other players waiting in the bread line include Jarrod Washburn, Felipe Lopez, Russell  Branyan and 
Jermaine Dye.
5. The return of the Mac.In spite of what might be the 
world’s most pathetic steroids apol-ogy, Mark McGwire now returns to the major league as the St. Louis Cardinals’ new hitting coach. Cardinals skipper Tony La Russa  
brought his old Oakland bash broth-er into the clubhouse to mentor a group of talented young hitters and to oversee an offense that includes the otherworldly powers of Albert Pujols and Matt Holliday. 
The real question is if La Russa 
will keep McGwire  on the active ros-
ter to use as a pinch hitter. It’s very unlikely, but weirder things have hap-pened — like the steroids-era poster-boy returning as a hitting coach. 
I must be maturing as a sports 
writer; I just wrote a whole column on baseball without once mentioning my home team, the San Francisco Giants. Oops.

▶ BLANC, MYVTWHNLing seven shutout innings, allowing four hits, no walks and striking out four batters. The win was Rossman’s first of the season.
On Saturday, Gregorich was one of 
UCSD’s many offensive contributors, going 5-6 with seven RBIs and five runs scored. Saul hit for the cycle in both games combined.
The first game featured 18 hits, 
with six players collecting multiple hits: Saul, Gregorich, Kehoe, junior catcher Michael Benton and sopho-more outfielder Danny Susdorf all contributed as multiple-hitters. Leading 6-1 through six innings, the Tritons broke the game open with an eight-run seventh inning. UCSD cruised to a 15-2 win and set the tone for the day. 
In the second game of the double-
header — and the final in the series — Saul opened up the route by hit-ting a home run in the first inning. Gregorich singled and stole second base as Kehoe batted him in, putting UCSD up 2-0 in the first inning. 
Senior right-hander Kirby St. John 
tossed four shutout innings, allowing just two hits on four strikeouts. 
In the second inning, Albitz 
smacked a two-RBI single to center-field, giving the Tritons a 4-0 lead. UCSD then loaded the bases, and Gregorich promptly cleared them for a three-RBI double to centerfield, giv-ing the Tritons a 7-0 lead. UCSD never looked back, and ended the game with a 16-0 win. 
“We are preparing this week like 
we do every week of the season, ” Saul said. “Our focus does not change depending on who we play, and I believe this is one of our strengths as a team. ”
The Tritons open up conference 
play this week against No. 23 Chico State. According to Kehoe, he will maintain a high performance stan-dard at practice this week.
“ As a team, our practices are always 
intense and very productive, and we pride ourselves on showing up every day and getting better, ” Kehoe said. “Obviously, we have been doing a lot of things right, but as a team, we pride ourselves on getting better every day. 
We are preparing for Chico just like we prepare for any other series. We know it’s our first conference series, so it’s obviously a meaningful series — but we aren’t changing the way we go about anything. We just need to keep playing our game. ”
UCSD hopes to play off their 
momentum as they head into confer-ence. They will first host the Wildcats, who are 4-0 overall and 4-0 in CCAA action, and who swept Cal State East Bay last week to begin their confer-ence play. The four-game set begins on Friday, with first pitch scheduled for 2 p.m. at Triton Baseball Field.

drive. ”
The next two games served as the 
comeback UCSD needed.
Gaito’s complete game shutout 
on Saturday led the Tritons to vic-
tory. UCSD tallied a run in the first inning and tacked on three more in the sixth to claim its first win of the four-game series. 
Junior infielder 
Katrin Gabriel ripped a single and stole third on Eliades’ sacrifice bunt. Gabriel would later reach home to give UCSD a 1-0 lead in the first inning. De Fazio’s two-run double down the left field line gave the Tritons three insur-ance runs to ensure a win, while Chico was unable to make any sort of comeback in the sev-enth inning. 
After pitcher’s duels 
in the first and third games in the series, offense starred in the final meeting, as UCSD edged the Wildcats out 10-9.  
UCSD lost momentum in the 
first inning but regained control in the bottom of the second. Chico put three runs on the scoreboard in both the first and second innings. 
The Tritons responded in the bot-
tom half of the second inning, send-ing seven players across home to take the lead 7-6. Lesovsky, Eliades and De Fazio scored the final three runs in the second inning off a Saari double to the left center. 
“Our bats came alive today, ” 
junior infielder Sarah Woofter said.  “It shows that our team is full of fire and heart, even if we are down 0-6. ” 
Chico State took the lead back 
with three runs in the top half of the third inning but couldn’t score the rest of the way. 
After the first two Triton pitch-
ers struggled to halt the Wildcat offensive onslaught, Gaito took the 
mound and retired 16 of the 19 batters she faced, striking out four and allowing only three hits.
Trailing 9-8 in the 
bottom of the sixth, a double by All-American Lesovsky over the cen-terfielder, a sacrifice bunt by Saari and a single by Spangler gave UCSD the run needed to tie the game at 9-9. Freshman infielder Dyanna Imoto pinch-ran for Spangler — with a grounder from Haley — scored the winning run for UCSD, 10-9. 
“We have the fight 
and heart to show that we want to win since it could have been a long game, but in the end it 
was going in our favor, ” Gerckens said. “ As a team, we need to play harder — with better defense — and execute more to make more consis-tent runs. ”
UCSD’s two wins handed Chico 
State its first two losses of the season, making them 4-2 over all, and 2-2 in the conference.
The women will look to keep the 
ball rolling, and make improvements before their next two games against Cal State Bernardino on Feb. 17.
Readers can contact Yvonne Chow at 
ychow@ucsd.edu.Later that day, at 3:30 p.m., the 
players’ momentum was halted when they were narrowly defeated 4-5 by regional rival: the No. 27  Brigham Y oung University, Hawaii.
However, the Tritons proved a 
stern test for the Seasiders, and held their own against the favored oppo-sition. The teams split the singles matches, each side winning three. 
Headlining the singles results 
for UCSD was No. 1 player Erik Elliot’s thrilling three-set victory over Brigham Y oung’s No. 1  — and No. 10 in the country — Rong Ma.
In the end, the Seasiders man-
aged to take two of the three doubles contests to earn the victory.
However, the competitive nature 
of the match was a major improve-ment from the previous meeting between the two teams, and Nguyen said the loss still boosted the team’s confidence.
“Last year, we lost to them 7-2, ” 
Nguyen said. “This year, we played them 4-5. They are ranked No. 2 in our region, and we were right there with them. That gave us confidence for the rest of the tournament. ”
Despite the hiccup against 
Brigham Y oung, the Tritons main-tained an energetic spirit over the next two days, scoring decisive vic-tories that included a 7-2 demolition of Western New Mexico University on Feb. 13 and an 8-1 drubbing of Montana State University, Billings the following day.
Against Western New Mexico, 
Elliot continued his impressive run at No. 1 in singles, following up his success against Brigham Y oung’s Ma with a straight set 6-4, 6-4 win over No. 24 junior Y air Banuelos. Also contributing singles victories was Nguyen, who improved his sea-son record 4-0 with a 6-2, 6-0 win over Western New Mexico’s No. 4 Francisco Damasio.On Feb. 14, after dispatching 
Montana State by sweeping the dou-bles contests and taking five of six singles matchups, the Tritons faced their sternest test of the weekend: a showdown with No. 25 Midwestern State University.
After a grueling string of four 
matches in three days, the Tritons displayed exemplary fitness and depth of skill, upsetting the Mustangs on the back end of a doubleheader.
The Tritons won two of three 
doubles matches against their favored opponents, receiving victo-ries at No. 1 doubles from No. 17 junior Armaum Emami and red-shirt freshman Austin West, and at the No. 2 spot from Elliot and sopho-more Jake Fellow.
In singles, No. 1 Elliot finished 
the tournament undefeated with his straight set victory, and wins at spots two through six from Nguyen — along with sophomores Sam Ling and Naveen Dixit — propelled the Tritons to a comfortable 6-3 win.
“It was important to come out 
strong from this tournament” 
Nguyen said. “It was huge to beat the No. 25-ranked team, after losing to No. 27. It gave us a huge amount of confidence to beat them, and was a nice highlight for the season. ”
Steidlmayer says that beating 
ranked opposition is something the Tritons will need to get used to if they are to achieve success in the postseason.
“We need to continue to have con-
fidence that we can be a Top-20 team, ” he said. “I think this is a Top-20 team at least, and with a little bit more, we can definitely be Top 10. It’s important that our guys believe that. ”
The team looks to continue its 
success story on the road against Azusa Pacific University on Friday, Feb. 19 — a match that was supposed to have been played on Feb. 6, but was rained out.
“We are going to practice, get 
s o m e  r e s t  a n d  l o o k  t o  t a k e  s o m e  momentum going forward, ” Nguyen said.

MEN’S TENNIS — The No. 35 UCSD 
men’ s team arrived in Phoenix, Ariz., on Feb. 12 for the three-day Paseo Tournament — hosted by Grand Canyon University— in search of a winning formula. Consecutive season-opening losses to the University of San Diego on Jan. 30 and Concordia University two days later had the team in search of answers.
Three days in Arizona and five 
matches later, they seemed to have found some.
“We had a rough start, ” junior 
captain Vince Nguyen said. “We went back to train, worked a lot on doubles and felt pretty confident coming in. ”
On the Paseo Racquet Center 
courts, the Triton men translated confidence into results, upsetting higher-ranked Midwestern State en route to posting a 4-1 record — all over a rigorous weekend that squeezed five matches into three days.
“It’s good to get a lot of matches, ” 
head coach Eric Steidlmayer said. “That’s something this group needs. We need the experience of playing this much. ”
At 9:30 a.m. on Feb. 12, the 
Triton players opened up the tour-nament in style, pummeling hosts Grand Canyon 8-1. Seven of the team’s wins were in straight sets. Nguyen said a positive attitude and team camaraderie were instrumen-tal to their success.
“We all felt great out there, ” 
Nguyen said. “We competed hard from the beginning. Everyone was cheering each other on — yelling at each other every single point. It was very positive out there. ”The men’s tennis team 
tallied its first wins of the year, toppling ranked opposition at the Paseo Tournament.

BASEBALL — Living up to their No. 
3 national ranking, the UCSD base-
ball team swept a four-game series against Grand Canyon University from Friday, Feb. 12 to Saturday, Feb. 13.
The Tritons dominated GCU both 
days, outscoring them 52-4 in the series. Three of the four games fea-tured 15 or more runs from UCSD, yielding final scores of 6-0, 16-2, 15-2 and 15-0 and improving their overall 
record to 9-1. GCU fell to 3-5 overall. 
The Tritons began the series with 
a Friday doubleheader, junior righty 
Tim Shibuya taking the mound in game one and shutting it down. Shibuya hurled seven shutout innings, allowing just three hits on eight strike-outs. The Wyoming native improved his earned run average to 2.65, and is now 3-0 on the season.
Three GCU errors were all UCSD 
needed on offense, as the Tritons scored five unearned runs in the fifth inning. 
“During the GCU sweep, the 
entire team was clicking in all areas, ” junior outfielder Kyle Saul said. “Our pitchers only gave up four runs, and consistently pounded the ball down in the zone. Our offense put up 52 runs, and was relentless in our approach of driving the ball to right center field. As an offense unit, we wore down their pitching staff. ”
Junior designated hitter Aaron 
Bauman went 2-4 with two runs batted in in the first game, while junior third baseman Evan Kehoe collected three hits. Senior first baseman Brandon Gregorich — who was named the 
Wilson/California Co llegiate Athletic 
Association player of the week after 
going 11-for-16 with 16 RBIs and two home runs against GCU — added two hits of his own. 
The Tritons scored three unearned 
runs in the fifth inning as Bauman and Gregorich hit back-to-back doubles with two outs. Kehoe then stepped up to the plate and continued 
the two-out rally, whacking a single to put UCSD up 5-0. The Tritons cruised 
to a 6-0 win under the arm of Shibuya. 
“We played very well throughout 
the whole series, ” Kehoe said. “Our hitters did a great job with their plan at the plate — driving the ball the other way — and this helped us put up a lot of runs. The pitchers also did an excellent job pounding the zone and challenging their hitters. It was an 
all-around great series for the team. ”
In the second game of the dou-
bleheader, UCSD exploded with 15 
hits and 16 runs, putting up three four-run innings. Junior right-hander Daniel Simmons improved his record to 2-0, going 4.1 innings and allow-ing four walks, five strikeouts and only one earned run for two hits. The UCSD bullpen shut out GCU in the 
last half of the game. 
UCSD was trailing 1-2 in the third 
inning before Bauman blasted a two-
run shot to put the Tritons up 3-2. Saul, senior shortstop Vance Abitz and senior outfielder Robert Sedin each made two hits apiece. 
The Tritons scored four runs in the third inning, four in the fourth, four in the fifth and three in the sixth to pull away with a 16-2 victory.
After winning the first two games 
of the series, the Tritons aimed for the same results in Saturday’s dou-bleheader. Senior right-hander Matt Rossman started the first game pitch-ON THE COMEBACK TRAIL

UCSD’s softball team rebounded with back-to-back wins against Chico State after losing the first two games of a four-game series on 
Feb. 12 to Feb. 13. The Tritons hosted the Wildcats on their new field at RIMAC Arena, where they evened their record to 3-3 overall and 2-2 in the California Collegiate Athletic Association.
According to head coach Patti Gerckens, the 
team set the right tone for the rest of the season and overcame weak spots in both their defense and offense.
“It’s important that we don’t want to fall behind 
early on in the season, ” Gerckens said. “These two wins help us stay very competitive. ” 
In the first game, on Friday, UCSD’s offense 
struggled to push through any runs: Chico’s start-ing pitcher Kacie McCarthy pitched a complete 2-0 shutout. After allowing a run in the first inning, sophomore pitcher Camille Gaito pitched five shut-out innings before giving up an insurance run to Chico in the final inning. 
UCSD fared no better in the second game of the 
series, coming up short 6-7 despite a fierce rally in the seventh inning. The Tritons battled back from a 0-7 hole in the fourth with two runs in the fifth, thanks to consecutive hits by senior shortstop Mandi Eliades, junior outfielder Kris Lesovsky and senior catcher and team captain Nicole Saari. 
Silenced in the sixth inning, UCSD’s bats heated 
up again as the Tritons loaded the bases. Hits from sophomore outfielder Kellin Haley, Saari, junior infielder Jennifer De Fazio and freshman infielder Nicole Spangler drove home four runs, but a ground-out ended the rally with UCSD down one run. 
Saari said Friday’s losses reminded the team to 
not take any opponent lightly — even one consid-ered to be an easy win.
“It was a bad showing of our abilities, but our 
comeback shows we never give up, ” Saari said. “We just need to come out more focused, and see every team as important to give us that extra competitive

Now that the excitement from 
the New Orleans Saints’ Super Bowl victory is rapidly 
fading (just in time for Mardi Gras ) 
and global warming is doing its best to melt the Vancouver Olympic games into a snow-free event, there are slim pickings in the sporting world.
The World Cup is still months 
away, no new Tiger Woods playmate has stepped forward for her 15 min-utes and I’m frankly not very interest-ed in Gilbert Arenas’ new basketball-weapons venture (the NRA-NBA). 
So, as pitchers and catchers report 
to camp this week for the beginning of spring training, I happily welcome the official start of the 2010 Major 
League Baseball season. Whether 
players spent their vacation time hibernating in million-dollar homes or toiling in the Dominican winter leagues, over the next two weeks, they will all convene at their training com-plexes in Arizona and Florida to play some long toss and take a few rounds of batting practice — as Opening Day 2010 inches closer and closer.
Here are five stories to follow as 
spring training begins. Pour yourself a tall glass of grapefruit juice and find some shade behind a cactus, because baseball’s back.
1. Can the Y ankees stay drama-
free?
New Y ork followed its World 
Series Championship with a very un-Y ankee offseason: lowering  the team 
payroll, and passing on the mar-ket’s marquee-free agents for Curtis Granderson and Javier Vázquez — incredibly solid players without much flash. In the last decade, the Y ankees have made dramatic and headline-filling offseasons a habit, which have always added to New Y ork’s tradi-tionally contentious spring trainings — and George Steinbrenner’s hernia collection. But this spring, the boys in pinstripes roll into Florida with-out any of the distractions that have Blanc
