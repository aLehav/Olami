COACH HARPER 
RETIRES 
Very few collegiate coaches 
in the country can claim a 
four-decade career at a single 
school. Even fewer of those 
coaches could say they’ve 
been around for the majority of 
their school’s existence.

Graduate and Post-graduate Students Protest Against 
Untenable Working Conditions
By Brandon Mariano  /gid00004/gid00042/gid00041/gid00047/gid00045/gid00036/gid00029/gid00048/gid00047/gid00036/gid00041/gid00034/gid00001/gid00024/gid00045/gid00036/gid00047/gid00032/gid00045
UC San Diego academics associated with the 
union UAW (United Academic Workers) or -
ganized a demonstration on Tuesday April 
26, marching from the Biomedical Sciences Labora -
tory to La Jolla Village Drive to protest against their 
claims of pervasive workplace abuse, workplace dis -
crimination, inadequate pay, and extreme rent bur -
den. During their demonstration, protestors gath -
ered in the street and closed oﬀ access to Interstate 5, 
causing traﬃc congestion in a bid to bring attention 
to their cause. 
/T_he protest was in response to recent bargaining 
sessions the union had with UC administrators, in 
which UC allegedly drew back on important worker 
rights and bene/f_its. According to UAW claims, UC 
administrators have been reluctant to implement 
important employer bene/f_its to ensure equity such 
as family leave, fair housing, and respectable com -
pensation.
/T_he main issue concerning demonstrators was 
the lack of proper compensation by the University of 
California for academic workers, despite the ongoing 
in/f_lation in San Diego. 
“/T_hey are proposing pay raises that are actually 
pay cuts because they are below the rate of in/f_lation,” 
Zach Goldberg, a third-year PhD biology student, 
said. “None of us can really aﬀord rent here, it’s one 
of the most expensive cities in the country and we get 
paid like garbage. I spend more than half my income 
on rent.”
/T_he in/f_lation rate in San Diego hit 8.2 percent 
in the beginning of the year. /T_his now makes San 
Diego’s in/f_lation rate the third highest in the coun -
try. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 
March, San Diego experienced an astonishing 7.9

Create Biodegradable 
Shoe

/T_hree professors at UC San 
Diego, Stephen May/f_ield, Michael 
Burkart, and Robert Pomeroy, 
have created the world’s /f_irst shoe 
using completely-biodegradable 
materials. /T_he team launched 
their shoe products on Blueview 
Footwear a/f_ter a six-year project 
of research and experimentation 
speci/f_ic date.
/T_he company advertises the 
shoes as the world’s /f_irst biode -
gradable shoe, made completely 
from plant-based oils that can be 
composted over time instead of 
being sent to land/f_ills. /T_he shoe 
aims to reduce carbon emissions 
and combat climate change. 
/T_he shoe is 65 percent re -
newable, and its materials can 
be reused, but is also completely 
biodegradable and can be fully 
composted within six months. 
With a price of $135 for the shoe, 
the website also oﬀers free ship -
ping and 30-day returns.
/T_he company website states 
that the shoe was created as a re -
sult of large amounts of toxic waste 
and plastics dumped into the 
ocean. /T_he process to make such 
a shoe /f_irst began over six years 
ago when May/f_ield began his own 
project of turning algae into fuel, 
in order to substitute fossil fuels 
for a plant-based fuel, as stated on 
the UCSD news center website. 
May/f_ield is a professor from 
the biology department, specializ -
ing in the synthesis of green algae 
and its uses as a fuel. Once May -
/f_ield and his team, which consisted 
of Burkart and Pomeroy, were able 
to create a plant-based fuel, they 
focused their attention on creating 
a plant-based shoe that was com -
pletely compostable. /T_hey /f_irst cre -
ated /f_lip /f_lops using the foam they 
had developed from green algae.
“We started making /f_lip /f_lops 
with the algae-based material,” 
Burkart said. “It was important 
that our products were not only 
renewable, but also biodegradable 
because we saw a huge problem 
with plastic waste in the ocean … 
and we did not want to contribute 
to the problem.” 
A/f_ter achieving success with 
the /f_lip /f_lops, Burkart stated that 
the team then went on to start a 
company to reach a larger scale, 
creating a more widely-usable 
biodegradable, closed-toe shoe 
consisting of the same foam, with 
a shoe top made from hemp and 
cellulose.

As we enter the halfway point of the spring quarter, 
more and more students begin their housing searches. 
However, the issue of housing accessibility and aﬀord -
ability has once again become an unavoidable issue for 
many. 
For next year, UC San Diego plans to oﬀer 13,000 
beds to undergraduate students. According to Asso -
ciate Director of University Communications Leslie See LABOR , page 2

percent overall price increase in food, energy, and 
housing.
“/T_here’s no way to sugar coat it, the university is 
exploiting us,” Adu Vengal, a second-year graduate 
student in the math department, said. “/T_hey know 
that we are rent burdened. /T_hey know how much 
costs have increased in San Diego. /T_hey proposed 
three percent wage increases. /T_hose aren’t wage in -
creases, those are wage cuts.”
Peter Kim, a graduate student in the physics de -
partment, echoed that the proposed pay raises feel 
like a “pay cut” given the in/f_lation rate.
“One of the major poignant things that are hap -
pening right now is bargaining,” Kim said. “/T_he UC 
is actively denying an open bargaining table for all 
the UCs to bargain together. /T_he UC actually pro -
posed their own contract to Student Researchers 
United union and part of the contract was that we 
were gonna get three to four percent raises which is, 
if you look at in/f_lation rates nowadays, an eﬀective 
pay cut.”
“Part of the nature of the exploitation that we are 
facing is that we are not making enough money to 
live where we work,” Lauren Bibi, a PhD student in 
the biology department, said. “We need better wages 
now. In combination with the lack of fair wages and 
lack of job security for workers, there’s also a big 
open problem of supervisor abuse on the campus. 
It’s sort of an open secret in academia but something 
that’s not open publicly.”
/T_his problem of work environment mistreatment 
was another major concern amongst demonstrators 
and of which many felt triggered the full-/f_ledged 
protest. Along with eﬀective pay increases to counter 
Sepuka, 5,372 continuing undergraduate students 
who submitted a continuing housing application were 
oﬀered housing contracts. /T_his group included stu -
dents in UCSD programs with a four-year housing 
guarantee, new incoming /f_irst-year and transfer stu -
dents, and returning second-year students. 
Due to COVID-19, the university was not able to 
have triple housing in the 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 
years. /T_he lessening of guidelines to allow a limited 
number of triples has allowed the university to add

to emphasize the need to imple -
ment anti-bullying protections 
for workers.
Goldberg added that many 
labs had a toxic work environ -
ment, with international students 
allegedly being the most vulner -
able.
“/T_here’s harassment, discrim -
ination, bullying, and hazing 
that happens in labs as a matter 
of course and not uncommon, 
it’s everywhere and it’s all the 
time,” Goldberg said. “We have 
international students who are 
intimidated. /T_heir supervisors 
hold their visas over their heads 
to make them work harder.”
“A graduate student was bul -
lied out of his lab in front of the 
rest of the department by a super -
visor and was eventually /f_ired and 
kicked out of the program and 
basically deported back to India,” 
Amy Kanne, a PhD student in the 
computer science department, 
said. “/T_here’s just no consequenc -
es for supervisors that engage in 
this type of behavior and that’s 
what we want written down into 
a contract with the UC.” 
Erika Cervantes, a spokesper -
son for the University of Califor -
nia, responded to these allega -
tions via email to Inside Higher 
Ed. 
“We highly value the role all 
these employees play in support -
ing our students and our faculty, 
and UC’s mission,” Cervantes 
said. “Our overarching goal with 
each of these negotiations is a 
multi-year agreement that recog -
nizes these employees’ many im -
portant contributions to the UC 
community with fair pay, quality 
health and family-friendly bene -
/f_its, and a supportive and respect -
ful work environment.”
Cervantes went on to say that 
UC hopes to have “good-faith 
negotiations” with the UAW to 
come to a resolution to the con -
/f_lict. He also praised the “tremen -
dous resilience, /f_lexibility, and 
unwavering commitment” of em -
ployees and the UC community 
over the past two years.
“We respectfully disagree 
with the union’s assertions about 
takeaways and UC being intran -
sigent,” Cervantes added. “Our 
proposals for postdocs and GSRs 
[graduate student researchers] 
include annual pay increases 
and enhanced paid leaves. We 
are very early in our bargaining 
with our other academic student 
employees and have not yet ad -
dressed those issues. We are com -
mitted to fair pay, quality bene/f_its 
and a supportive, respectful work 
environment for all of our em -
ployees.”
Currently the bargaining pro -
cess between the union and the 
University of California is ongo -
ing, with no promised contracts 
established.
If one is in dire need of emer -
gency housing on campus at 
UCSD, they may reach out to 
Basic Needs. /T_he process begins 
when one /f_ills out a Basic Needs 
Assistance form, but they may 
also email basicneeds@ucsd.edu 
for temporary housing. 
If one is facing mental health 
struggles at UCSD, they may 
reach out to Counseling and Psy -
chological Services at (858) 534-
3755 or by messaging their pro -
vider via MyStudentChart.700 undergraduate beds. 
Sepuka also noted that ap -
proximately 870 undergraduate 
second-year students are currently 
on the waitlist. As vacancies open 
up in the summer, more oﬀers will 
be given based on students’ prior -
ity status and the date when they 
submitted their waitlist applica -
tion.
Due to the lack of on-campus 
housing available, many students 
have begun the diﬃcult search to 
/f_ind oﬀ-campus housing. Many 
students have never bought or 
rented a place before and are o/f_ten 
confused about the process. 
Additionally, San Diego rents 
can be a /f_inancial burden, as the 
average 2-bedroom apartment’s 
monthly rent can be $3,736. On 
the other hand, a double room on 
campus usually costs $1,170 per 
month per person. 
When asked about their opin -
ion on housing aﬀordability, /T_hur -
good Marshall College sophomore 
Arianna Andrade noted that 
housing near campus felt imprac -
tical for low-income students. 
“Recently, I’ve begun working 
two, almost three jobs (while be -
ing a full-time student) to barely 
have enough to live somewhere 
near campus,” Andrade said. “I’ve 
considered moving to Tijuana 
and crossing daily just because it 
would be a lot more aﬀordable for 
me to do so.” 
To help lighten the burden, one 
of students’ /f_irst tasks when look -
ing for oﬀ-campus housing is to 
/f_ind roommates. O/f_ten, students 
turn to Facebook groups to orga -
nize groups to /f_ind housing. One 
of the most popular groups, UCSD 
Student Oﬀ-Campus Housing, 
has 48.0K members and regular 
daily posts with listings or people 
searching for roommates. 
With or without roommates, 
students will have to trek on a 
house hunt in communities sur -
rounding campus, from nearby 
ones like La Jolla or University 
City to further oﬀ areas such as 
Clairemont. 
/T_he general consensus is that 
the further away from campus, the 
cheaper or better deals one will 
/f_ind. On Zillow, a two-room rental 
close to campus can be listed at 
$3,500 a month. Meanwhile, a two-
room rental in Clairemont can be 
listed at $2,850 a month. However, 
that o/f_ten comes at the expense of 
longer commutes, which isn’t easy 
for students who have to rely on 
public transportation. 
Another major hurdle students face are landlords and applica -
tions. Students are o/f_ten unsure 
about what responsibilities and 
powers landlords legally have. 
Additionally, applications may 
sometimes come with fees or se -
curity deposits that may confuse 
students. 
To help nav igate t hrough t he is -
sues of renting, Student Legal Ser -
vices (SLS) oﬀers services to help 
students understand leases and 
security deposits. Located on the 
/f_i/f_th /f_loor of the Student Services 
Building, SLS oﬀers free, con/f_iden -
tial legal services to currently en -
rolled UCSD students and student 
organizations, ranging from legal 
assistance with forming a small 
business to helping students who 
are charged with crimes. 
However, the biggest problem 
the SLS are approached with, ac -
cording to SLS director Jon Carlos 
Senour, would be students’ issues 
with security deposits and leases. 
In an interview with /T_he 
UCSD Guardian, Senour stated 
that a good way students can en -
sure they’ll receive their security 
deposits back is to take pictures of 
the rental’s condition when mov -
ing in, and then take them again 
when they move out. In the situa -
tion that a landlord refuses to give 
back the security deposit, these 
pictures could be crucial to get it 
back.  
Additionally, Senour suggested 
that when students send in their 
applications, they provide as much 
as they can to prove that they will 
be able to pay the rent every month. 
/T_hese documents can include a 
physical copy of the /f_inancial aid 
students can receive, or getting 
a statement from the Residential 
Life oﬃce for their dorm rooms. 
Additionally, students should try 
to invest in the best renter’s insur -
ance to help cover some costs. 
Senour also suggested that 
parents can write letters stating 
that they will be able to help their 
children pay rent. However, he 
strongly discouraged cosigners or 
guarantors due to a Californian 
rule of law called “joint and sev -
eral liability.”  
“Joint and several liability is a 
fancy way of saying that each ten -
ant in a case can be held 100 per -
cent responsible for the tenants 
collectively,” Senour explained. 
For example, if one out of three 
roommates is not able to pay their 
monthly rent, the landlord is al -
lowed to evict all three of them, 
not only the roommate who didn’t 
pay because they all collectively signed a contract.  
“And if you have a cosigner — a 
parent or guardian — that person 
is going to be responsible for ev -
erybody. In other words, not just 
their student, but everybody on 
the lease,” Senour said. “/T_he land -
lord can take action and absolutely 
will take action against all tenants, 
even the ones who presumably are 
not breaking the lease.” 
Other than SLS, UCSD oﬀers 
multiple resources to help students 
/f_ind oﬀ-campus housing. /T_he 
main resource is the Oﬀ-Campus 
Housing Oﬃce, where students 
can schedule housing consulta -
tions, receive help with /f_irst-time 
lease signings, and /f_ind other re -
sources for moving in and out. 
/T_he oﬃce’s website also features 
listings, house hunting tips, and a 
roommate-/f_inder tool. 
Other resources the university 
oﬀers are websites with oﬀ-cam -
pus house hunting tips, oﬀ-cam -
pus rental forms, and guidelines 
on landlord, tenant, and room -
mate responsibilities. Students 
can also join the Associated Stu -
dents Oﬃce of Food and Housing 
resources Facebook page to /f_ind 
other students who are looking for 
roommates or rooms.
 Finally, UCSD’s Basic Needs 
Center has created a student food 
and housing guide available for 
students. Additionally, the Ba -
sic Needs Hub provides housing 
resources, food security, and /f_i -
nancial wellness workshops. /T_hey 
also help connect students to tran -
sitional housing and short-term 
emergency housing. 
However, some students argue 
that this is not enough support. 
When asked if UCSD does enough 
to help students, Andrade stated 
that they believe the university 
doesn’t care enough about their 
students. 
“/T_hey took away the 2-year 
housing guarantee, and the only 
reason I found housing was be -
cause I lived on campus during 
the year where everything was 
remote,” Andrade said. “I think 
UCSD’s administration has been a 
mess these past two years that I’ve 
gone here, and I wish they would 
do more for their students instead 
of just building more random lec -
ture halls.”

Burkart said. 
Burkart, a professor from the 
chemistry department who leads 
his own lab in a project of discov -
ering and bio synthesizing natural 
products, acted as Chief Scientist 
for the project. He played an im -
portant role in the creation of the 
shoe itself as well as the develop -
ment of the company. 
“/T_hese are all technologies that 
we developed here in our labs at 
UCSD,” Burkart said. ”In the com -
pany, I lead the development of 
the materials and the formulation [as well as] the scale up … how we 
were able to go from a few grams 
in the lab to a [much larger] scale 
in a chemical manufacturing facil -
ity.” 
Another key individual in the 
creation of the product is Pome -
roy, from the biochemistry depart -
ment. A/f_ter joining the depart -
ment in 2007, he collaborated with 
students in the manufacturing of 
biofuels and plant-based polyure -
thanes. A/f_ter being involved with 
initial formulations, Pomeroy’s 
current role in the project is apply -
ing analytical chemistry to assure 
the quality of the product being produced in the lab.
“My role mentoring the un -
dergrad and masters students that 
work with me in the lab is to focus 
on the quality control of the start -
ing materials and then monitoring 
the chemical fate of our products 
as they undergo chemical and 
biological degradation,” Pomeroy 
said.
Pomeroy’s aspirations for 
the creation of the shoe revolve 
around showcasing to the world 
that it is possible to create products 
that are better for the planet that 
still maintain the quality desired 
today. While there are many chal -
lenges that arise with the creation 
of the shoe, a challenge that Pome -
roy faced was within the selling 
aspect of the shoe, in a term la -
beled “greenwashing” where the 
authenticity of the product has to 
be proven.
“[A challenge with the shoe 
was] the bad messaging associ -
ated with an advertising strategy 
known as ‘greenwashing,” Pome -
roy said. “So while we have made a 
great product, we now must com -
municate to everyone the genuine 
value of our product compared to 
others that claim to be green.” Many of the employees in the 
company are former students, and 
Burkart stated that since research 
is always happening and materials 
are constantly being developed, 
there are many opportunities in 
his lab as well as May/f_ield’s and 
Pomeroy’s labs for students to get 
involved.

Raymond Tran
 Objectivating STEM Education
STEM education in the U.S. 
has become embroiled in politics, 
far from the objective nature of 
STEM. Florida, a conservative 
state, recently rejected 54 
math textbooks, citing reasons 
including “references to Critical 
Race Theory (CRT), inclusions 
of Common Core, and the 
unsolicited addition of Social 
Emotional Learning (SEL) in 
mathematics.” On the other 
hand, many colleges, mostly 
liberal, have made standardized 
testing optional, or even 
omitting them, such as the UC 
system. As a STEM student, 
my first thought was that while 
social justice is important, it 
should belong in social studies 
and history classes; it should be 
kept separate from math, which 
is purely objective. And since 
STEM is objective and critical 
for the economy and progress, we 
should simply set a high national 
standard and objectively hold 
students accountable through 
standardized testing. However, 
as I do more research and 
reflect on my experience as a 
student, the more uncertainties 
arise about the realities of 
implementing education.
One of the examples of 
“problematic elements” provided 
by the Florida Department of 
Education shows an exercise in 
polynomial modeling that uses 
data associating bias with age and political identification from 
the Implicit Association Test, 
which is a method not without 
controversies. When used for a 
brief math exercise, much context 
of how the data is collected is 
taken out. For example, how was 
data collected and how are the 
scores calculated? Without this 
context, students may develop 
inaccurate biases that certain age 
groups or political affiliations 
are more or less racist, which 
may lead to ageism and political 
discrimination. In addition, 
STEM is a difficult subject for 
many, and having students 
grapple with the big issues of 
social justice as they learn math 
may be too much for students’ 
bandwidth.
There are other options to 
teach polynomial modeling that 
are free of controversy and relate 
to real world applications, such 
as the height of a rollercoaster 
along its path or the cross-
sectional height (silhouette) of 
a mountain. These objective 
examples are superior because 
there is no possible way for 
them to become controversial, 
allowing students to focus on 
learning what they are supposed 
to be learning. Thus, neutral 
objective content should be used.
However, as many critics 
point out, Florida’s rejection 
of textbooks has political 
undertones. While supporting 
the removal of social justice 
content from math textbooks 
based purely on ideology is not 
a rational reason, the fact that social justice content tends to 
be controversial, subjective, and 
thus distracting is a valid reason. 
There is still a place for different 
social theories to be taught 
in social studies and history 
classes where controversy is not 
distracting, but in fact beneficial 
for students to have cross 
dialogue and confront the issues 
of society.
Since STEM can and 
should be taught objectively, 
then it can and should also be 
evaluated objectively through 
standardized testing. However, 
as of now, there is a huge list 
of 900+ test-optional colleges, 
with tips on whether or not to 
submit standardized test scores, 
turning the application process 
into some kind of strategy game. 
While putting less emphasis on 
objective test scores may make 
more sense for non-STEM majors 
in subjective fields such as arts 
and humanities, STEM majors’ 
potential is directly affected by 
how well one knows the objective 
fundamentals. According to a 
study by the ACT, “Elliott and 
Strenta (1988, p. 334) described 
mathematics and science 
curriculums as ‘hierarchically 
organized and unforgiving of 
any lack in basic knowledge 
or skill.”The reality is that no 
matter how creative you are, you 
will not get far in STEM without 
a solid background. With the 
prospects of STEM careers 
attracting many, resources are 
stretched thin. This can be seen 
in the difficulty to get a spot in many STEM classes at UCSD, 
despite the class being restricted 
to capped majors. It does not 
help to spend these resources on 
remediating students on subjects 
they should have learned in 
high school. Those admitted 
to STEM education must be 
already prepared for the rigor, 
and standardized testing is the 
objective means of evaluating 
that preparation.
Proponents of removing 
standardized testing argue that 
standardized testing favors 
privileged demographic groups, 
and removing this barrier allows 
underprivileged individuals 
to gain access to good college 
education which will allow 
them to develop their potential. 
However, college resources are 
spread too thin to allow someone, 
even with potential, to develop 
from the ground up. One should 
first ask why are there people with 
undeveloped potential? Getting 
rid of standardized testing for 
STEM is only ignoring the issue 
of inequality in the quality of 
K-12 education, and transferring 
the burden to colleges.
Literature, including 
those from the University 
of Pennsylvania, the United 
Nations, and healthypeople.
gov suggests that inequalities 
in education compound. These 
data generally show achievement 
gaps preexisting before students 
enter formal schooling, and the 
gaps propagating throughout 
a student’s academic career. 
For example, if one learns how to read earlier, then one can 
study more effectively, offering 
an advantage that widens the 
knowledge gap over time. Just 
like with accumulating interest 
in banks, it is advantageous to 
invest early in education. Thus, 
it is not standardized testing 
that systematically screens out 
underprivileged individuals, but 
it is the K-12 school system that 
does so, or rather fails to close the 
preexisting gap, and standardized 
testing only objectively reflects 
this inequality. In this view, 
standardized testing would then 
be beneficial by spurring action 
to address the issue where it 
matters: providing equal and 
quality K-12 education.
From the rejection of math 
textbooks to the rejection of 
standardized testing, STEM 
education in the U.S. has become 
a political battlefield, despite 
STEM being an objective topic. 
Florida made a good move to 
reject math textbooks for the 
bad reason of antagonizing CRT, 
and UC made a bad move to 
reject standardized testing for 
the good reason of promoting 
social justice. As shown by 
international test scores, U.S. 
STEM education lags many other 
countries. We need to untangle 
STEM and politics by reorienting 
ourselves to the objectivity of 
STEM, so that we may focus 
on improving both STEM and 
social justice in parallel.By Benjamin Liou

Generational Trauma Representation in 
Media Serves as a Method of  Healing
As I’m sure you’ve noticed, 
there has been a recent trend 
by many large movie studios 
to tackle the complex topic of 
generational trauma. Some 
examples of this trend are clear in 
Pixar Animation Studios, which 
has produced “Coco,” “Encanto,” 
and “Turning Red” in its most 
recent cultural exploration era. 
This throughline in modern 
Pixar movies tackles aspects of 
generational trauma through 
a medium of some magical or 
spiritual aspect. These aspects 
make the familial pain come 
to light and also help bridge 
broken relationships and heal 
family structures. This trend 
is not unique to Pixar though, 
as A24 has recently released 
“Everything Everywhere All At 
Once,” which tackles this trauma 
through an interdimensional 
journey to discover the absurdity 
of life and how love makes it 
meaningful. Even Netflix has 
released a series relevant to this 
trend in its second season of 
“Russian Doll,” building off its 
initial season of “Groundhog 
Day”-esque soul searching, 
which has its main characters 
travel in time, physically inhabit 
their older generations, and learn 
that the past is unchangeable yet 
intentional. 
So with all this being 
said about who is tackling 
generational trauma in movies, 
what is it really? According to the 
National Library of Medicine, 
the term originates from a study 
on the transgenerational effects 
of trauma in the offspring of 
Holocaust survivors, which 
found that “not only traumatic 
experiences, but also resilience 
patterns can be transmitted to 
and developed by the second 
generation.” The term now 
refers to the way that substances, 
events, and beliefs of traumatic impact and emotional turmoil 
get passed down through familial 
generations. The scope of what 
can be passed down ranges from 
physical or substance abuse, 
neglect, the effects of war, and 
addiction. Whether viewed 
through epigenetics, which 
describes how certain events can 
impact gene expression, or how 
children absorb the environment 
around them, how trauma from 
one generation can cause lasting 
effects of trauma for following 
generations. 
This difficult topic has taken 
center stage in cinema, begging 
the question of  its value and 
necessity. What is the purpose of 
digging up the past and dealing 
with the issues that are ingrained 
into cultural and familial 
heritage? This question presents 
some valid criticisms of this type 
of movie and hits at the root of 
the purpose of film and media 
as a form of entertainment and a 
chance to escape from reality for 
a few hours.
For people like Samantha 
Amantea, a Roger Revelle 
College sophomore, this trend 
“can be damaging in how it’s 
presented because it simplifies 
a multifaceted issue and ties 
it in a bow by the film’s end.” 
For Amantea, “the themes of 
unity and discovery are cliche” 
and the “Disney ending of a 
happily ever after’’ is too plain 
and ‘’predictable.” She criticizes 
the structure of this trend in 
the media because “there are 
many people whose generational 
trauma is impossibly difficult to 
tackle.” Amantea details a few 
complications such as “death, 
abuse, political polarization, 
and separation from family” 
that make it difficult to “make 
amends, to forgive, or want to 
re-engage with the trauma.”
Others like Ahla Lotti, a 
Seventh College sophomore, 
argue that this trend is “overdone 
already.” “It is only written into film 
because it seems to add depth of 
meaning,” Lotti said. “placing 
a given family at the head of 
generational trauma, especially 
when this family comes from 
a minority background, means 
that they come to inhabit the 
culture as a whole and that 
the depicted narrative can be 
both stereotypical and fail to 
contend with important aspects 
of generational and cultural 
trauma.” 
Both of these interpretations 
get at the root of what’s 
intended with this genre of 
film. Although these movies 
can seem like they can make 
light of repairing generational 
trauma or can come to represent 
a group without intending to, the By Erik Wieboldt
/gid00004/gid00042/gid00041/gid00047/gid00045/gid00036/gid00029/gid00048/gid00047/gid00036/gid00041/gid00034/gid00001/gid00024/gid00045/gid00036/gid00047/gid00032/gid00045
message that they want to give 
off is one of wholesomeness. The 
purpose of movies like this is to 
escape from your daily life into 
something more entertaining, 
more cathartic, more simple 
and sometimes to inspire values 
in its audience. Sometimes this 
escape requires simplification 
and a specific perspective that 
some people may not be able to 
resonate with. 
When I think of why these 
movies are being made to 
tackle generational trauma in 
an increasingly divided world, 
it seems that the purpose is 
to escape from the pain that 
many people feel within their 
families and to instill in the 
audience a sense of peace, open-
mindedness, and closure.I understand that for many 
people, this generational trauma 
is static and unchangeable, 
but the vision of this trend 
is to inspire hope for a more 
compassionate, unified future. 
Even if it neglects the concept 
of found family and emphasizes 
family as unreasonably 
important, it allows the audience 
to escape into a world where 
their problems are absent and 
their focus can shift to a story 
of growth — even when their 
family, generations, and cultural 
background may feel like they 
are withering and distant.

Essay: Are We Watching the 
Death of  Variety in Theaters?
/T_he COVID-19 pandemic brought about a complete shi/f_t in the 
/f_ilm industry. Distributors could no longer rely on box oﬃce sales and 
theaters to rake in revenue for their /f_ilms. Subsequently, they turned 
to streaming services and smaller general releases in order to have 
their /f_ilms seen by wider audiences. T oday, moviegoing is less popular 
than ever, with 49 percent of pre-pandemic moviegoers no longer at -
tending multiplex theaters. A grim statistic with even darker implica -
tions for the industry at large. 
In March 2022, Amazon acquired MGM in an $8.45 billion deal 
that took almost a year to close. /T_he acquisition gives Amazon own -
ership of over 4,000 /f_ilms and all subsequent /f_ilms MGM purchases. 
However, the possible rami/f_ications of such a deal could mean there 
may be one less studio willing to distribute a movie that isn’t a high-
budget blockbuster or another adaptation of an existing property. 
While Amazon did go on record to state that the reason for their pur -
chase was due to MGM’s extensive catalog of /f_ilms and capacity for 
remakes, the executives at MGM face an uphill battle with the diﬃcult 
merger ahead. 
While these two events are completely isolated, when placed to -
gether they paint a bleak picture for the future of /f_ilm. Not only is it 
getting harder to release a /f_ilm as an independent /f_ilmmaker not as -
sociated with any pre-established franchise or IP , but it’s also getting 
harder to get people to even want to see it. If that wasn’t enough, what 
infrequent consumer bases and the acquisition of major distributors 
and producers from tech giants mean is that fewer risks want to be 
taken on $50 million and under budget /f_ilms. Even as more /f_ilms re -
turn for grander-scale theatrical releases, the current state of the mar -
ket has only seemed to re/f_lect this point further. 
/T_he review embargo for Sony’s newest $80 million entry in the ex -
tensive Marvel universe “Morbius” ended only two days before public 
screenings began, an already poor sign for what would become one of 
the worst box oﬃce debuts for Marvel since the release of “/T_he New 
Mutants.” Early critic reviews called the /f_ilm “disjointed” and “bor -
ing.” Others lamented that it was “about as bad as you were expect -
ing.” On most accounts, the /f_ilm was a complete disaster and yet an -
other blemish on Marvel’s troubling track record spanning 65 /f_ilms.
Just a week prior to “Morbius” came the newest /f_ilm from direc -
tors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert “Everything Everywhere All 
at Once.” Made with a lean $25 million budget, the /f_ilm debuted to 
near-unanimous praise and performed incredibly-strong numbers 
on its /f_irst days. It’s currently the highest-rated /f_ilm on Letterboxd, a 
popular /f_ilm charting app, and on its opening night, the /f_ilm grossed 
$509.6K. An average of $50,965 per theater, it is the second-best post-
pandemic platform release behind “Licorice Pizza,” and the best open -
ing theater average in 2022 at the time. While all of that may sound 
great on paper, there is just one small issue: despite initial projections 
and performances from both /f_ilms, at the time of writing this, “Mor -
bius” has made almost double its budget since its release, and “Every -
thing Everywhere All at Once” has barely broken even.
By many accounts, Morbius is a failure. /T_he /f_ilm is cluttered with 
heaps of storytelling issues, an unlikeable protagonist, and above all 
else, the entire picture is just mind-numbingly boring. T o top it oﬀ, it 
also features one of the most disorienting, nonsensical, and uninter -
esting post-credits scenes in any Marvel /f_ilm; a post-credit scene that 
had already been spoiled in its own trailer. Yet, the box oﬃce numbers 
say otherwise. It’s made millions of dollars back and will likely con -
tinue to do so, despite near-universal hatred from critics. On the cor -
porate side of things, which to exhibitors is the only important part, 
the /f_ilm is a complete success. So where is the discrepancy? Why does 
this happen and continue to happen again and again?
As is with most complex issues, there are multiple answers to this 
troubling dilemma. On nearly every competitive front, adaptations 
and superhero blockbusters hold the market advantage. No exhibi -
tor is oﬀ-limits and the current social climate promotes cult-like fan 
behavior. /T_hese distinct advantages are not only recognized by cor -
porations, but they’re also consistently abused in order to achieve the 
highest gain.
Fan-Loyalty
T o begin, despite their closeness in release dates, it’s a bit unfair to 
compare “Morbius” to “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” Ignor -
ing the fact that they are radically diﬀerent /f_ilms, they also cater to 
completely-diﬀerent audiences. Marvel fans are not particularly dif -

/f_icult to please. Look at the audience score on Rotten Tomatoes for any low, criti -
cally-rated Marvel /f_ilm and you’ll be hard pressed to /f_ind an audience score below 
70 percent, with one of the few exceptions being Captain Marvel: a /f_ilm, which 
was infamously panned by fans due to the unfavorable casting of Brie Larson. /T_hat 
aside, most superhero adaptations have an edge due to the sheer number of die-
hard fans willing to watch and likely rewatch their entire catalog of comic-book 
adaptations. Put simply, it’s signi/f_icantly easier to sell something to someone who’s 
already bought it before.  
 Likewise, it’s diﬃcult to tease out the casual from the fanatical in fran -
chises like these. /T_hese /f_ilms are intended for general audiences, and therefore 
means that there are more chances for people to become engrossed in the over -
arching series as a whole. /T_hese movies are made to be incredibly marketable, inof -
fensive, and overall easily consumable. /T_his is an edge that most other /f_ilmmakers 
just don’t have unless their work is genre-speci/f_ic and lacking nuance. Even in the 
case of “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” the term “multiverse” had to be used 
in its marketing campaign extensively in order to capitalize on the term Marvel had 
just popularized thanks to “Spiderman: No Way Home.” However, in that sphere, 
the /f_ilm held the risk of potentially compromising its creative integrity. While it is 
a /f_ilm about multiverses, it feels unjust to call it a multiverse /f_ilm. /T_hat said, a lot of 
advertising choices like these are not always le/f_t up to the /f_ilmmakers themselves 
and have a lot to do with currently-available distributors.
Lack of Distributors and Exhibitor opportunity
 Despite giving a lot of independent /f_ilmmakers a chance, A24 is not very 
good at doing one of its core jobs: being a distributor. Recall that “Everything Ev -
erywhere All At Once” premiered in only 10 theaters, and while it certainly per -
formed well in those few, it’s a meager number compared to the thousands comic-
book /f_ilms enjoy on their opening nights. While it is currently still expanding to 
more theaters thanks to its initial popularity, it only got that a/f_ter proving itself to 
audiences /f_irst, which is something that adaptations simply don’t need to worry 
about doing. Exhibitors just don’t feel comfortable taking risks anymore, especially 
post-pandemic. However, not all the blame can be placed on them. A24 is also not 
amazing at getting the word out either, mainly driving their presence through so -
cial media, which causes a lot of their core fans to be younger. While this isn’t neces -
sarily a bad thing it does hinder the success of /f_ilms intended for mature audiences. 
Cultural Bias
Another major piece of current /f_ilm industry politics can be accurately under -
stood through the behavior of the masses. /T_here simply is just not as much buzz for 
low-budget /f_ilms as there is for $100 million blockbusters among general audiences. 
Disney has managed to create a cultural phenomenon: a phenomenon that also 
happens to be incredibly pro/f_itable not just for them, but for their exhibitors as well. 
/T_heir /f_ilms are considered a special social event. Every few months, like clockwork, 
we always encounter the craze the next “ Avengers” /f_lick conjures up, and then it’s 
time to gather all your friends and /f_ill up an entire row at the theater. 
Even for people who are only mildly interested in these types of /f_ilms it’s almost 
socially taboo not to occasionally watch, or at the very least follow up on them lest 
you experience alienation and “FOMO” from your peers who have already resigned 
themselves to such behavior.
So what does this boil down to? Are we seeing the death of “true cinema’’ in the -
aters as we know it? Perhaps the answer is not all that simple. Many enjoyed poking 
fun at Scorsese’s comments toward the MCU, including Spider-Man poster child 
Tom Holland himself, but his words are o/f_ten misunderstood in t he greater context 
of /f_ilm. When you compare /f_ilms like “Morbius” to “Everything Everywhere All at 
Once,” it’s signi/f_icantly easier to understand what the director truly meant. /T_here 
is no art in a /f_ilm like “Morbius.” In fact, it’s a prime example of what it’s like to 
watch something that gives the bare minimum. Despite this, no amount of public 
shaming could make the /f_ilm any less watchable, even for morbid curiosity’s sake. 
For now, let’s move past the clearly-elitist implication of denoting a /f_ilm as “real art” 
and think about things in a more nuanced fashion.  
/T_hese superhero /f_ilms and adaptations in general occupy their own space in 
the industrial complex that is cinema. In a strange way, they’ve almost evolved past 
their original state. /T_hey’re not just movies; they’re serialized, recognizable prod -
ucts. While it is true that not every /f_ilm needs to have some ingenious method of 
creation behind it or a rich and complex storyline, it would be nice to have that 
every once in a while. It would be even nicer to have that actually played at a local 
theater as well. /T_herein lies the true crux of the argument Scorsese put forward. /T_he 
bleak possibility is that we could see a lack of variety in theaters due to low box oﬃce 
turnout and unwilling exhibitors. 
/T_he current /f_ilm scope is a lot wider than most make it out to be, and those who 
do take the time to showcase its truly-vast breadth are largely ignored. Perhaps, we 
should more o/f_ten ask ourselves if what we are watching is really worth any of our 
time at all, because when we inevitably reach a burnout of overly-commercialized 
media, what really will be le/f_t? Cinema is not dead, despite what some may want to 
claim. However, it does need some avenging. What we can do as consumers in the 
current modernization of the /f_ilm market is be, at the very least, somewhat con -
scious of what we choose to watch. Despite being such a revered and successful 
occupation, very little attention is ever given to artists who are on the rise. Right 
now, independent artists are the small businesses of the /f_ilm market. On your next 
theater bout or Net/f_lix browsing session, why not choose that one weird indie /f_ilm 
with the unknown actors and obtuse premise. Perhaps, you’ll surprise yourself 
with what people are capable of when they /f_inally have a chance. TV Review: 
“Heartstopper”Grade: A
Directed by: Euros Lyn
Starring: Joe Locke, Kit Conner, Y asmin Finney, William Gao
Release date: April 22, 2022 
Adapted from the graphic novel 
of the same name by Alice Oseman, 
Net/f_lix’s “Heartstopper” delivers the 
queer youth coming-of-age story I 
wish I got growing up. Admittedly, 
I have not read the graphic novel yet, 
but, a/f_ter watching the show, it’s de/f_i -
nitely on my reading list now. 
/T_he show follows Charlie Spring 
(Joe Locke) and Nick Nelson (Kit 
Conner) as they navigate high school 
and their newfound romantic con -
nection. As with any teen romance, 
they endure the trials and tribula -
tions that come with young love, 
sexuality, and friendship. 
Every scene of this show was 
absolutely stunning, the colors and 
the lighting had a consistent theme 
of blue and orange. /T_he set and cos -
tume designs matched it perfectly. 
/T_hroughout the show, there were 
small elements of animation within 
the live-action, such as /f_loating leaves 
and scribbles, that paid homage to the 
original graphic novel. In addition to 
these components, the transitions 
between scenes were also animated 
as comic panels which completed the 
tribute to Oseman’s original work. 
Charlie’s emotions were re/f_lected 
through the on-screen animation, 
and the consistent color themes acted 
as unexpected elements that come 
together in perfect harmony which 
parallels Nick and Charlie’s relation -
ship.
/T_he soundtrack also comple -
mented the aura of the show really 
well. I appreciated how they decided 
to use the songs from queer artists 
such as girl in red, Rina Sawayama, 
and mxmtoon as a way to further 
their representational reach and sup -
port artists that are also part of the 
LGBTQ+ community. Small details 
such as these enhanced the viewing 
experience and gave the show a very 
unique aesthetic. Aside from adding 
to the overall ambiance of the show, 
the themes of the music o/f_tentimes 
paralleled the themes of the show 
which added another layer to the sto -
rytelling, such as when girl in red’s 
“girls” played in a scene that alluded 
to a lesbian relationship or Orla Gart -
land’s “Why Am I Like /T_his?” played 
when Nick was questioning his sexu -
ality. 
Every element of the show had a 
purpose, from the colors to the mu -
sic, and nothing seemed uninten -
tional. 
Nick’s exploration of his sexuality 
could almost be described as univer -
sal. /T_he show successfully captured 
the real-life experiences of growing 
up queer while still telling the cheesy 
romance story everyone wishes they 
could’ve experienced. /T_he represen -
tation is phenomenal. Each main 
character was given a plotline of their 
own that didn’t feel forced or out of 
place. It was a breath of fresh air to 
see queer characters be normalized 
while still exploring the nuances of 
the queer experience, both the good 
and the bad. /T_he show was success -
ful in doing a lot without doing too

2022 UCSD Film Festival 
– A Student Blockbuster
Triton TV hosts UCSD’s very /f_irst student body /f_ilm festival and creates a sense of community along the way.
Movies. Film. Cinema. /T_he art form of motion pictures goes by many names. While recent years of constant 
superhero and blockbuster releases may lead people to believe that formulaic cash grabs are all that the art form has 
le/f_t to oﬀer, that’s far from the truth. Movies are still a medium that allow people to express themselves in a way that 
they see /f_it and allows others to see themselves in those expressions. In short, movies can still unite people, and no 
better example of this unity was put on display than at the UC San Diego Film Festival.
UCSD’s /f_irst student body /f_ilm festival — organized by Triton TV — was held on April 23 at the Price Center 
/T_heater, lasting almost the entire day. I entered with an open mind to the festival in regard to both the amount of 
people I expected to be in attendance and the quality of the /f_ilms, and I surely wasn’t disappointed with either. As 
the day carried on, there were more and more people, creating an enthusiastic environment the entire time. As cer -
tain /f_ilms were announced, groups of people would cheer on the /f_ilmmakers, but by the end of the /f_ilm, everyone 
in attendance always gave a strong round of applause. /T_he event had an especially strong turnout of moviegoers on 
campus for the festival’s /f_irst outing, a promising sign for years to come.
“I thought the movies were wonderful,” Anel Valdez, a senior in attendance, said. “It was a great experience to be 
able to see students’ work, and I think it’s a great way to get everyone to connect, so that way they’re about to promote 
their work, and then whether it be their friends or general audiences that’s interested in /f_ilm, I think anyone can just 
come out and support and enjoy this event.”
/T_hroughout the course of the event, there were three /f_ilm categories: documentary, experimental, and narrative. 
Although just three categories, the range within each category was so vast, spanning so many /f_ilms, that it would be 
diﬃcult to describe them all in one article, so I will limit myself to a select few of each category.
/T_he documentary category had everything from a short, but sweet documentary about a UCSD badminton 
player named Advit Gupta with “Dreamer,” to a longer piece about the current climate change situation and how the 
UC system is involved with “Coming Clean.” /T_his category’s showcase /f_ilm was “/T_he General Store,” a documentary 
about, who would’ve guessed, UCSD’s beloved General Store. /T_his documentary was directed by Justin Marquez 
and follows the perspective of fellow employee Zaya and how she came to discover the campus co-op, her day-to-day 
routine there, and how the store manages to survive in the face of a red adversary: Target.
Here’s what Justin and Zaya had to say about their experience:
Justin Marquez - “/T_he General Store”: “’/T_he General Store’ is my baby. I worked at the General Store prior to 
the pandemic for a couple months and I got really well acquainted, those are all my friends, and it was a really good 
experience working with them. I /f_ilmed it approximately a year ago to this day, and it was an emotional experience 
making it. /T_here were some obstacles that I had to get through, so it was really ful/f_illing seeing the reactions, being 
in the crowd, seeing people really react positively to the work, laugh, enjoy the charismatic banter between all the 
members at the co-op because it con/f_irms that it was worthwhile to make it all along.”
Zaya Gooding - actress: “Being in the documentary really helped strengthen our relationship with TTV ,” Zaya 
said. “I think what’s so great about the Old Student Center is that a lot of us aren’t in one thing, most of us are in -
volved in more than one co-op or organization here, so Justin being both with the General Store and TTV has really 
helped us strengthen that relationship and don’t think we had that before the documentary, which I think is really 
awesome to be able to work with them and having that contact there because they’re really wonderful and great and 
excellent at what they do.”
/T_hen as late morning turned to early a/f_ternoon, we reached the experimental category and, as the name would 
imply, it was very experimental. /T_his category featured everything from poem recitals with “/T_houghts in Poly -
syndeton”; a self-re/f_lective monologue between the /f_ilmmaker and her subconscious /f_ilmed as a casting tape with 
“A la na Bu rgess’ Sel f Tape”; a photog raph stop mot ion piece i n “A l l C olors Go to Black ”; a nd a “Scot t Pi lg r i m vs t he  
World”-esque /f_ilm about roller skaters /f_ighting the corporate patriarchy in “Lola vs the Cockalorums.” Each one of 
these /f_ilms was nothing like the last, each demonstrating students’ diﬀerent personalities and approaches to /f_ilm -
making.
Here’s what some of the experimental /f_ilmmakers had to say during the event:
Alana Burgess – “ Alana Burgess’ Self Tape”: “It’s exciting, it’s just a whole new wheelhouse for me. I’ve never done 
/f_ilm before, so everything is brand new, so it’s quite overwhelming but in a good way. My favorite part about making 
the /f_ilm was releasing a bunch of bottled-up emotions I had that I just needed to get out artistically.”
Sydney Ho – “/T_houghts in Polysyndeton”: “It’s really exciting, I’m kind of scared honestly, but it’s really cool to Hector Arrieta /gid00002/gid00046/gid00046/gid00036/gid00046/gid00047/gid00028/gid00041/gid00047/gid00001/gid00006/gid00031/gid00036/gid00047/gid00042/gid00045
work on something and then have it seen by the people you care about.”
Millie Root – “ A Letter to Her God”: “It’s a little bit nerve racking, but 
it’s really awesome to have this opportunity on campus and feel supported 
by not only my professors, but a student org as well, so that’s really exciting. 
I get to create exactly what’s on my mind, maybe not exactly all the time, 
but overlapping frames is really important to me and the color blue is really 
important to me, and that was very apparent in my /f_ilm. Also the fact that 
I got to work through my grief, my /f_ilm was about personal grief, so I got to 
work through that personally through art.”
/T_he narrative category almost felt like an extension of the experimental 
category. I mean this as a compliment as the variety of narratives and ap -
proaches were so diﬀerent that I was excited for each piece even as the a/f_ter -
noon turned to evening. /T_here were serious movies like one that tackled the 
question of biases when creating AI with “Reboot”; another that took a dive 
into mental health and schizophrenia with “/T_he Diagnosis.” /T_here were fun -
ny pieces like “Quack Quack,” what I thought to be a homage to “Chucky” 
but with rubber duckies, and “/T_he College” and “David Bun/f_ill’s Guide to 
UCSD” which were both mockumentary-style pieces poking fun at UCSD.
Here’s what some of the narrative /f_ilmmakers had to say during the event:
Matthew Stepanek – “Falling Once, Falling Every Time”: “I usually don’t 
show my work to anyone, and this is the /f_irst time it’s being screened in a 
public setting, and I’m nervous, but it’s very exciting, and it’s really cool to see 
my /f_ilm up against other student /f_ilms. /T_he best part about college for me, 
and the best part of an art program is to see all the work that my peers are 
making. It’s inspiring to see such good stuﬀ.”
Kristine Nguyen – “/T_he Kettle Over/f_lows Past Midnight”: “I think that 
having my /f_ilm screened with a bunch of other amazing artists and /f_ilm -
makers is pretty exciting. I’m mostly here for the community, to show 
support for other people’s work. I think that the best part about this is the 
relationships that are formed, the friendships that are formed. /T_hat’s what 
makes making art worth it, that I get to build things with other people and 
be creative with other people.”
Jalal Al-Marashi Jaﬀer – “Reboot”: “I poured a lot of work into this piece 
and I’m excited to see how other people enjoy it, maybe what they take away 
from it. /T_his speci/f_ic project was very interesting because it was a science /f_ic -
tion piece, a techno horror piece pushing the boundaries of what science is 
today, but it’s actually using a robot from /f_ive years ago, giving it use, giving 
life, putting a story to it to make us question our own humanity today.”  
If there’s any consistent theme between the sentiments of the /f_ilmmak -
ers, it’s that of community. /T_he festival de/f_initely brought out the best that 
the /f_ilmmaking and moviegoing communities of UCSD have to oﬀer; /f_ilm -
makers were able to display their work to the UCSD student body, and mov -
iegoers provided a positive atmosphere for everyone to enjoy the experience 
of watching the work of fellow Tritons and friends alike. Given that this was 
Triton TV’s /f_irst /f_ilm festival that’s open to the entire UCSD population, 
marking campus history, one can surely expect Triton TV to reach for the 
stars in future years.
Grade: A
Directed by: Euros Lyn
Starring: Joe Locke, Kit Conner, Y asmin Finney, William Gao
Release date: April 22, 2022 much. 
One of the most interesting and 
well-done aspects of the show’s repre -
sentation was through Charlie’s trans -
gender friend Elle (Yasmin Finney). 
Her story starts oﬀ a/f_ter she has already 
transitioned, not necessarily making 
her storyline revolve around her being 
a transgender individual but also never 
leaving out the experiences that shaped 
her life. /T_his type of trans representa -
tion is really rare to /f_ind, especially 
in mainstream media. /T_here was no 
question about her identity as a wom -
an, it was an accepted fact. While some 
of her struggles stemmed from her 
experiences as a trans person, her sto -
ryline captured multiple aspects of her 
life, including a romance of her own. 
Additionally, there was a certain 
relatability in the ways Nick and Char -
lie interacted with each other and with 
themselves, from the crush-on-a-
straight-guy pain to the confused and 
frustrating state of questioning your 
sexuality. I think it’s important to point 
out that this show didn’t feel like it was 
trying too hard to be relatable, instead, 
it felt as though they were simply tell -
ing a story, one that many people could 
relate to. /T_he way in which Nick also 
comes to terms with his sexuality is done beautifully. His exploration was 
so modern; the frustration, the con -
fusion, and the fear that accompanies 
this experience felt so raw, and more 
importantly, relatable. 
Every part of the relationship be -
tween Charlie and Nick felt organic, 
from their immediate chemistry to 
the growth of their romance. Char -
lie’s past relationship leaves him bro -
ken, but Nick is there to pick him up. 
Every time Nick and Charlie were in 
a scene together, it was impossible to 
not smile at their chemistry. /T_he way 
that Nick reassures Charlie of his love 
for him makes me, in the best way 
possible, want to throw myself oﬀ a 
bridge. 
On that note, I have only two 
gripes with the show. /T_he /f_irst is the 
writing. At times the dialogue felt 
a little awkward and didn’t seem to 
/f_low as well as other scenes did. Sec -
ondly, watching this show just makes 
you sad, but a good kind of sad. As 
someone who is chronically single, 
there’s nothing more bittersweet 
than a love story. /T_his type of teenage 
queer romance isn’t something many 
LGBTQ+ individuals experience, in -
cluding me, so while I was rooting for 
Charlie and Nick to have their happy ending, I was also feeling a little lonely. 
Consider this your warning: this show 
will make you look at your love life and 
think “what am I doing wrong?” 
Nevertheless, this show and the 
representation of LGBTQ+ youth is 
something much needed in enter -
tainment. While it was kind of obvi -
ous this show is tailored towards the 
teenage audience, that didn’t stop me 
from enjoying, and crying at, every 
part of it. If little middle-school-me 
would have been able to witness such 
a beautiful and normalized represen -
tation of queerness, it would have al -
lowed me to love the part of myself I 
was conditioned to hate and helped 
me through the most confusing time 
in my life. Now as an almost 20-year-
old, I can con/f_idently say that this show 
still means a lot to me. My experiences 
growing up queer feel validated. 
As someone who has enjoyed 
shows like “Y oung Royals” and books 
like “Red, White, and Royal Blue,” 
“Heartstopper” was a perfect addition 
to the genre of queer romance. If you 
love cheesy romantic stories, queer rep -
resentation, and amazing aesthetics, 
I would de/f_initely recommend giving 
this show a watch.

NELSON  ESPINAL 
Where History Students Stand at a “STEM School”
 
UC San Diego is ranked as one 
of the top research universities in 
the world, with over a $1 billion 
devoted yearly to research on 
vaccines, wildfire prevention and 
more. The university is acclaimed 
as one of the top science innovators 
and centers of study and learning. 
Though outsiders most often hear 
about the science side of UCSD, 
the history department is just one 
example of a lesser known — yet 
no less valuable — field at UCSD.
Clare van den Vlekkert is a 
junior in Roger Revelle College, 
double majoring in history and 
international studies-political 
science. She said she’s faced some 
difficulty in finding her place as a 
humanities major at UCSD. 
“When I said I wanted to go to 
UCSD for history, everyone asked 
me, ‘why?’ You go for computer 
science, you go for engineering,” 
van den Vlekkert said. 
Nick Theodore, a senior in 
Thurgood Marshall College, is 
also a history major. He’s been 
content with his social and 
academic experience in the history 
department. As president of the 
Undergraduate History Network 
(UHN), Theodore has felt close to 
the history community. 
“I would say that I’ve pretty 
much been satisfied in every way,” 
Theodore said. 
UCSD offers various fields 
of emphasis for history majors, 
including Europe, East Asia, 
Africa and more. Though 
Theodore has been happy with 
the variety of classes he’s been able 
to take, van den Vlekkert wishes 
that she could find a little bit more 
variety. 
“As somebody who has a very 
non-American and non-European 
interest in humanities, I wish that 
there was a little more diversity,” 
van de Vlekkert said.
Robert Schung is a sophomore 
in Thurgood Marshall College. 
He’s another history major, and 
works alongside Theodore, serving 
as the vice president of UHN. He, 
too, has enjoyed his classes within 
the history department at UCSD.
 “Classes here for the most 
part are really good at teaching 
you overall history, but also sort 
of developing skill sets that are 
more of the crux of the major,” 
Schung said. 
The UCSD history 
department website states that 
its undergraduate program 
intends to “   emphasize critical 
thinking, good writing, effective 
argumentation, and the analysis 
of historical materials.”
Though van den Vlekkert has 
witnessed some of these values, 
she also addressed the confusing 
expectations that can sometimes 
accompany her history courses. 
“It’s very subjective,” van den 
Vlekkert said. “There’s no clear 
cut way to be a humanities student. 
When it comes to grading and 
stuff, it’s very, ‘we expect you’re 
gonna write the way that we like 
it.’ You have to write in a way that 
benefits you.” 
Despite this occasional 
frustration, van den Vlekkert UCSD history students share their experiences as humanities majors at UCSD, a university generally 
known for its STEM focus.

passion and commitment to 
their fields of study. 
“The professors here are 
very passionate about what they 
do. If you can get a seat in those 
very limited classes, it’s clear 
that it’s very much what they’re 
interested in,” she said.
Theodore agreed, adding 
that he finds the faculty to be 
“very accessible.”
Many students have been 
able to find a community 
among their peers through 
smaller, more focused classes. 
Theodore noted the absence 
of a vibrant social culture at 
UCSD as an obstacle to building 
community. 
“It’s not the easiest place to 
socialize and to feel connected 
with people, but I would say 
that the classroom environment 
makes it somewhat accessible to 
find,” Theodore said.
Though Theodore has 
been successful in developing 
friendships through his history 
classes, van den Vlekkert found 
this difficult at times. 
“In the history department, 
most of the people that I meet 
in history classes are not 
history students, it’s more to 
fill out a GE,” van den Vlekkert 
said. “There’s still this lack, this 
disconnect between me and 
other students.” 
Out of the 55 academic-
department-affiliated student 
organizations at UCSD, an 
estimated five can be categorized 
under “humanities,” and only 
one, the UHN, is dedicated to 
history. Dozens are devoted to 
bioengineering, mathematics, 
computing, robotics, and even 
other non-STEM fields like 
finance and political science.
In order to address the 
lacking social community 
among humanities majors at 
UCSD, van den Vlekkert is 
hoping to create a club entitled 
the Social Network. It will 
function as a space for history 
students and other humanities 
students to stay connected. 
“There was a gap in 
communication between all 
humanities majors,” van den 
Vlekkert said. “We came 
together and formed this club 
trying to address this gap in 
dialogue between humanities 
students through social events.” 
She hopes to act as a directory 
of resources for humanities 
students, giving them a place 
to get their questions answered, 
meet people, and increase their 
connection to the community.
Though van den Vlekkert 
initially found it difficult to 
integrate into the UCSD history 
community, her experience 
hasn’t been one-sided. 
“I do think that when you 
do start taking more classes in 
your field of emphasis, it gets 
a little bit easier, but it’s still 
hard trying to get through that 
stigma,” van den Vlekkert said. 
Schung has been fairly 
satisfied with the social 
component of his experience. 
“Coming to a large public 
resource university, I was 
surprised at how easily I think 
connections can be made, especially among a rather small 
department,” Schung said. 
Alongside the social aspect, 
access to research opportunities 
acts as another important part 
of students’ experiences with 
their major. STEM students are 
encouraged to participate in 
UCSD’s  well-known research 
culture. In comparison to 
their STEM counterparts, 
some history students have felt 
neglected with regard to these and 
other resources. Schung thinks 
that more accessible research 
opportunities within humanities 
would be a helpful addition to 
the history department. 
Van den Vlekkert also 
expressed frustration with the 
absence of accessible research 
opportunities. 
“I have to go to five different 
academic websites, talk to three 
different professors for resources, 
just for them to say, ‘we don’t 
know,’” van den Vlekkert said. 
“And that’s the hardest part, I’ll 
always be hit with an ‘I don’t 
know.’”
One can make a quick 
comparison between the 
resources for history majors and 
those of  popular UCSD STEM 
majors like biology. The biology 
major resource page is home 
to information sessions and 
workshops, experiential learning 
and internship opportunities 
and lists related student 
organizations. 
On the history undergraduate 
resources page, students can 
access information on academic 
integrity, petitioning courses, 
enrollment unit caps, and 
grade appeals. These resources 
appear to be much more surface-
level, rather than provide 
opportunities to advance or 
apply students’ learning. 
Though Theodore has found 
what he’s needed in his four 
years at UCSD, he recognized the 
discrepancy between resources 
for different majors. “We might have a unique 
situation there where we’re 
kind of picking up the slack of 
a smaller department at some 
level,” Theodore said. “It’s a 
little bit of an uphill battle that 
we kind of have to work for 
ourselves.” 
UHN is building an 
internship resource, as well as a 
mentor-mentee program. 
“I have had people remark 
that in our case of UHN, some 
of the duties that we take on 
as an org might not actually 
be left up to students in other 
departments,” Theodore said.
For instance, other 
departments like engineering or 
biology would provide readily-
made mentoring or resources 
without the necessity of a club to 
facilitate it. 
Despite T heodore’s 
understanding of humanities 
students as more curious and 
unsure, van den Vlekkert doesn’t 
think UCSD gives its students 
enough ways to clarify these 
doubts. 
“There’s so much emphasis 
on students having to pave their 
own path. STEM majors don’t 
have that problem,” van den 
Vlekkert said.
Although some history 
students feel that resources are 
lacking, there are other values to 
being in the minority at UCSD. 
“You’re at a prestigious 
university; this is a really good 
school. To be in a smaller major 
means that you still have access to 
that upper sort of faculty, really 
good instructors, but you’re also 
in smaller class environments, 
especially in upper division,” 
Theodore said.
Regardless of major, students 
at UCSD can take classes across 
countless fields of study. Schung 
expressed his gratitude for the 
breadth of classes available on 
campus. 
“One of the goals coming into 
college that I had was getting that well-rounded sort of education, 
at least having the opportunity 
to pursue that,” Schung said. 
Theodore, too, is grateful for 
the wide range of classes. 
“I never really wanted to 
narrow my choices, that’s why 
studying history here at UCSD 
was a pretty good option,” 
Theodore said.
Even with a smaller presence 
at UCSD, humanities majors can 
have an impact on their peers. 
Schung believes humanities 
students can help others 
understand different aspects of 
their futures and careers. 
“I think we fight to sort of 
showcase what pathways and 
pursuits could be viable for 
STEM majors as well,” Schung 
said. “Humanities and social 
sciences play an essential role in 
connecting the sciences to the 
real world.” 
“I want [STEM majors] to 
walk away with a more holistic 
view of what it means to be 
human, because that’s what 
the humanities study,” van den 
Vlekkert said.
The UHN continues to 
provide resources for students to 
explore future pathways, talk to 
their older peers and pursue the 
topics they’re most interested in. 
Though van den Vlekkert 
has experienced obstacles 
throughout her time here, she’s 
excited to witness and look 
forward to changes in the future 
of UCSD humanities students. 
“There is a sense of 
accomplishment in paving 
the way for future humanities 
students. It’s sort of turning 
the stigma away from being a 
STEM university, and saying, 
‘we’re here, we do matter.’ Being 
a presence here at UCSD and 
going against the grain is just 
something very important in 
itself,” van den Vlekkert said. FEATURES  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , MAY 2, 2022 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  9
 Abortion Rights Wade into Muddy Waters
 
Since the Supreme Court case 
Roe v. Wade issued its landmark 
ruling pertaining to abortion in 
1973, the pro-life movement has 
continued to protest and disagree 
with it. The case has continued 
to set the tone for abortion rights 
legislation in America.
Over the past few years, 
however, red states have 
attempted and started to institute 
more abortion restrictions. 
Two weeks ago, Florida banned 
abortions after 15 weeks, 
following Mississippi’s similar 
abortion ban. 
The Mississippi and Florida 
abortion bans do not provide 
exemptions for rape, incest, or 
sexual trafficing —  only for life-
threatening emergencies. 
Other states carry “near-
total bans” on standby in case 
Mississippi wins their legal 
case over the abortion outlaw; 
these ban all abortions except 
“life threatening abortions.” 
Oklahoma has led the charge 
for this kind of ban, with 18 
states instituting a similar kind 
of legislation. 
Both of these types of 
abortion bans (limiting and 
near-total) are reopening the 
discussion about Roe v. Wade 
and its standing as a precedent. 
The Supreme Court is 
currently reviewing Mississippi’s 
abortion law (which has failed at 
every lower level of court) and if 
overturned, could reverse the 50 
year reign of Roe as the standard 
for abortion rights. 
The decision about whether 
Roe will be overturned is 
expected to come within the 
next couple months. The state’s 
actions, with the rollout of so

Art by Nicholas Regli for the UCSD Guardian.
many anti-abortion laws, seem to 
indicate a potential overturning. 
Jennifer Hendricks, Professor 
of Law at the University of 
Colorado Law School, published 
a study, based on precedent, 
about how far the court could go 
in an overruling of Roe. 
“It’s safe to assume that six 
justices are inclined to repudiate 
Roe, and some of those six would 
like to go further, declaring a 
constitutional right to life that 
would prevent the abortion issue 
from going ‘back to the states’ 
at all,” Hendricks said. “One of 
the six, Chief Justice Roberts, 
is known to prefer stealth 
overruling of precedent, and he 
will likely convince at least one 
other member of the majority to 
overrule Roe carefully.”
With the conservative lean in 
the Supreme Court, the decision 
to strike down Roe could be 
down the line. 
The aftermath of an 
overturning leaves uncertainty 
for the future of abortion rights. 
Marjorie Dannenfelser, president 
of the Susan B. Anthony List, 
addresses the muddied future of 
abortion rights in each state. 
“But that’s what consensus 
is, it’s the consensus of people 
living in [each] state,” List told 
NPR. “So it will be different 
in Alabama than in North 
Carolina, which will be different 
from the state of Washington, 
from Texas.”
In each state court, officials 
can create different standards 
and precedents for the set state. 
The governor of Michigan, for 
example, has already stated 
their desire for state courts to 
allow abortions. The way courts 
lean, whether Democratic or 
Republican, will ultimately allow 
for the laws to be enacted. 
The Supreme Court currently 
leans conservative, even with the introduction of Justice Kentanji 
Brown Jackson, a progressive 
judge. Professor Hendricks 
assumes the end goal is more 
than just allowing for a pathway 
for abortion. The overall official 
outcome of a post-Roe abortion 
landscape may result in abortion 
potentially becoming illegal all 
over the United States.
“The end-game here is not 
just to overrule Roe in the sense 
many people continue to naively 
assume, where abortion gets ‘sent 
back to the states,” Hendricks 
published. “The trajectory of this 
argument is not just to overrule 
Roe but to establish a right to 
life for the fetus, superior to the 
rights of the pregnant woman, 
not through a constitutional 
amendment but through a 
Supreme Court decision, so 
that the Supreme Court would 
rule not just that abortion is 
unprotected but that it is, in 
fact, constitutionally prohibited 
everywhere in the U.S.” 
The ramifications of abortion 
restrictions extend into health 
care procedures as well. The 
hesitation over procedures or 
coverage could result in potential 
health complications for some 
women. Breana Lipscomb, 
senior advisor for Maternal 
Health & Rights at the Center 
for Reproductive Rights, further 
highlights overarching health 
complications for pregnant 
women. 
“Pregnant people themselves 
may hesitate to seek health care 
services for miscarriages or 
obstetric emergencies out of fear 
that they will be criminalized or 
punished,” Lipscomb said. “With 
abortion services restricted 
or banned, pregnant people 
experiencing complications or 
pregnancy losses may be forced 
to travel long distances and even 
across multiple state lines just to access appropriate care.” 
Even while abortion remains 
legal, abortion services like 
Planned Parenthood are 
struggling in southern areas. 
The number of abortions 
happenings are going down, 
leading to more struggles to find 
a place still doing abortions. 
Planned Parenthood, one of the 
leaders in reproductive safety, 
are struggling with the abortions 
among the southern states. 
“The Deep South is one of 
the most difficult regions to find 
a provider to work in, and we 
understand how very lucky we 
are to have someone local to 
provide abortions five days a 
week,” Marty told Jezebel. “This 
discontinuation of abortion 
services has definitely impacted 
our own staff — who have already 
been working extra hours to 
meet the influx of Mississippi, 
Louisiana, and Texas patients 
— and are now adding these 
patients who have had their 
previously-booked Planned 
Parenthood appointments 
canceled on them.” 
If overturned, women 
face uncertainty about what 
procedures and steps are allowed 
during pregnancy. This lack of 
clarity can cause complications 
for pregnant women due to the 
pause over whether the hospital 
is able to operate, especially if 
what is life threatening is unclear. 
Gray area over what necessitates 
the removal of a fetus provides 
more questions than answers. 
“People should be able to 
access essential healthcare 
and make deeply-personal 
decisions about their health 
and their families free from 
political interference,” Lipscomb 
said. “Access to reproductive 
healthcare — whether abortion 
care or maternal healthcare 
— is critical for societies to prosper and thrive. Everyone, 
everywhere deserves the right 
to decide what is best for their 
bodies and health.” 
Much of the abortion 
landscape remains unclear, but 
the future of Roe lies in the hands 
of the Supreme Court. Given all 
of the indications, Roe v. Wade’s 
position as the landmark case 
is under jeopardy. The Court 
will announce the outcome in a 
few months, but the battle over 
abortion rights is far from over. 
The Mississippi case is only the 
beginning. LIFESTYLECONTACT THE EDITOR

Long Distance Heartbreak
Missing someone is among 
the most difficult things to bear. 
For both myself, and likely for 
many others, coming to college 
meant leaving behind the ones 
we hold dearest to our hearts. 
Living on campus meant no 
longer sharing our childhood 
homes with the families we love. 
It’s a challenging transition that 
often brings about feelings of 
loneliness and longing. 
And while those first few 
months of freshman year are 
easily the most heart-wrenching, 
moving back to campus after 
a summer at home remains a 
difficult adjustment. This year 
when I moved back to school, 
I still yearned for the comforts 
of my family’s company and the 
safety of the house I grew up in. 
But just as I did my first 
year, I began to acclimate to this 
new environment. Being away 
meant I was able to indulge in 
new experiences and meet the 
most remarkable and interesting 
people. Slowly things began 
to fall into place and before I 
realized it, I wasn’t feeling so 
homesick anymore. I had found 
a second family in these new 
friends I met, and this scary new 
place became my home away 
from home. 
As we near the midway mark 
of Spring Quarter, I’ve realized 
that there remains a hole in my 
heart that has failed to be filled. 
While I obviously miss dinners 
with my dad and chats on the 
terrace with my sister, we live 
in the digital era: a period that 
comes with the glorious perk of 
being able to maintain contact 
with the people I love even when 
they reside miles away. 
I’ve been able to keep in 
touch with the majority of my 
loved ones back home, but 
unfortunately, not all of them 
are so communicative. Not all 
of them care to check in. And 
it’s become my heartbreaking 
reality that the most important 
individual in my life is the one By Emily Ito

whom I just can’t reach. 
I understand that there’s 
complications and impediments 
to maintaining correspondence, 
but it is devastating nonetheless 
to never hear from my girl. 
When I think about how much I 
miss her, it shatters my heart and 
shakes my very core. 
MeowMeow, my sweet perfect 
angel, has been eluding all of my 
efforts to reach her. Life without 
her is a tremendous struggle, and

it hurts even more to know that 
she is currently living a life that I 
am not a part of. 
I’m plagued by the most 
intrusive thoughts, ideas that 
have the power to keep me up 
at night. 
“Does she miss me? Does she 
ever think about me? Does she 
even realize I’m gone?”
The worst part is, I know 
the answer to these questions. I 
know I haven’t crossed her mind since I stepped out the front 
door. I know she is currently 
cuddling with another, probably 
screaming sweet nothings in 
their ears at 5 a.m. like she once 
did to me. 
There is no loyalty when it 
comes to a kitty back home. 
MeowMeow sees nothing but the 
can of wet food on the counter 
and the person who will spoon 
it into her bowl at dinner time. 
I hope my dad realizes the superficialness of her affection. 
I hope my sister sees through 
her soft purrs and blank 
stares. I hope they realize that 
MeowMeow will never be theirs, 
just as I’ve come to realize that 
she was never mine. 
I’m not bitter, but updates 
from my dad of her daily 
mischief and photos of her day 
to day routine still hurt. She has 
continued life as always, without 
a care in the world. Even without 
me there, she is vomiting in her 
water bowl and throwing hair 
ties in the air. She’s still pooping 
on the carpet and sleeping the 
day away in her buttercup. It 
seems my absence has gone 
unnoticed. It seems her routine 
has been uninterrupted. And, 
it seems her demeanor remains 
unbothered. 
When I return home for 
breaks, she rests her eyes in my 
sister’s room, leaving the edge of 
my bed feeling empty and cold. 
It’s worse to be in her presence 
and know she has moved on than 
it is to be far away with nothing 
but the photos and memories of 
our good times together. 
And the humiliating truth 
is that no matter how much she 
ghosts me, no matter how much 
she pulls away, I will never stop 
missing her. I may feel resentful 
for her infidelity and for the 
way she actively confirms my 
insignificance, but she remains 
the same effervescent and 
beautiful cat that I fell in love 
with. I can not resist the angelic 
aloofness of her little round face, 
her powerful meow during our 
daily conversations, and not 
the enviable back arch that she 
flaunts at every opportunity. 
There is no replacement for 
the feeling of velvety fur on 
my legs as MeowMeow brushes 
against me while I sit on the 
toilet. She has a permanent place 
in my heart, an irreplaceable role 
in my life. I will always have this 
soft spot for my sweet, sweet cat, 
and I know that she is what will 
always keep me tethered to a 
hometown that I have begun to 
grow out of. 3:30pm

Very few collegiate coaches 
in the country can claim a four-
decade career at a single school. 
Even fewer of those coaches 
could say they’ve been around 
for the majority of their school’s 
existence.
But as he retires after his 
42nd season at the helm of 
UC San Diego’s men’s water 
polo team, Denny Harper has 
accomplished just that, to go 
along with 697 wins, and an 
astonishing 17 National Coach 
of the Year awards from the 
Association of Collegiate Water 
Polo Coaches. In his time at 
UCSD, Harper has also spent 
nearly three decades in charge 
of aquatics, and served as the 
women’s water polo coach for 16 
years, until 1999.
I met Coach Harper in 
his office at the Canyonview 
Aquatics Center for what I 
planned would be a cursory 
15-minute interview about 
his career and retirement. We 
ended up speaking for about 
an hour and 45 minutes, about 
sports at UCSD, the school’s 
history, and other topics we 
were interested in, a fraction 
of which has made it into this 
article. But I think that tells you 
a lot about Harper right there.
First off: after 42 years, 
why retire now? “The time is 
just right. 42 years of coaching 
on this campus is enough, 
combined with the fact that I 
coached before this. I’ve been 
coaching this crazy sport for 50 
years,” Harper said. “… I have 
five kids, I have a grandchild, 
I have another grandchild 
expected in September. I 
realize that that sounds a little 
stereotypical, but I love the fact 
that all my kids live in San 
Diego, and that sounds like a 
good time to me. Knock on 
wood, I have my health, and 
I’m super pleased that longtime 
associate head coach and 
former player Matt Ustaszewski 
is taking over, so that means 
that a lot of our longstanding 
traditions, values, and culture 
of the program will continue.”
“For over 40 years, I’ve never really done anything fun in the 
fall that didn’t have to do with 
water polo … Everything we do 
in this program 340 days a year 
is geared towards our campaign, 
so I’m looking forward to that 
— doing something in October, 
unheard of in the past.”
In the over four decades 
Harper has been affiliated 
with the university, he’s seen a 
lot of changes to a university 
that, when he began here, was 
younger than its students.
“I’ll first start by saying that 
I do have mixed emotions about 
the growth of everything. It’s 
exciting, it’s definitely needed, 
and UCSD has emerged as a 
major university… It’s not 
exactly sprawling, but I miss 
that old campus that was right 
around 8,000 students when I 
took over in 1980. It had a real 
charm to it of a quiet, sleepy 
beach school. There are times 
that I’ve missed that.”
I asked Coach Harper what 
sort of legacy he wishes to have 
left behind, and what sticks with 
him after coaching at UCSD for 
so long.
“One of the major, major 
reasons why I have ended up 
doing this for so long is getting 
connected to my players and 
their families. I was young and 
still somewhat of a knucklehead 
in the eighties, and I didn’t have 
some preordained plan to have 
a career in coaching … That 
four-year cycle just got a hold 
of me. Back then, there was no 
recruiting budget, no demands 
made of recruiting. You would 
talk to kids. And you get 
connected with your players and 
you want to see them through. 
And then, suddenly, I’m in my 
16th season [coaching] the men 
and the women…”
“[This year,] I had to finally 
realize I had to break this 
somehow. It wasn’t easy. It was 
only a couple weeks ago that 
I told the team. There’s seven 
redshirt freshmen on the team 
that I can tell are going to be 
great water polo players, great 
people, all that. But I can’t 
continue my relationship the 
way I normally would with 
them, or I’d be one of those 
coaches who would have to 
be asked to leave, like ‘Jesus, Coach Denny Harper on Retirement, Setting Records, 
and 42 Years of  Legacy at UCSD

Denny, you can barely walk.’”
“It’s kind of corny, but 
not many coaches get rich in 
coaching, especially in a minor 
sport. But let me tell you, I’m 
super rich in a lot of other 
ways. All the relationships I 
have with all my former players 
… I could never put a price 
tag on that. There’s so many 
things that were important 
to me that I was willing to 
sacrifice, perhaps, financially, 
in other work opportunities 
… All five of my kids, they 
were pretty much raised here 
at Canyonview. They were a 
part of closed-door halftime 
moments, and reflecting on 
all that makes me realize that 
that was a real benefit for my 
kids. The connection with the 
players, and how it translated 
into a long-term family 
experience has been fantastic. 
And [Ustaszewski], I told him 
just the other day, ‘If you have 
half as great of a coaching life 
as I’ve had here at UCSD, you’ll 
be stoked.’”
Coach Harper has a bevy of 
accolades, including 17 National 
Coach of the Year awards — 
including nine consecutive 
wins from 2011–2019 — and 19 
conference Coach of the Year 
awards from the Western Water 
Polo Association. But Harper 
insists that individual awards 
are ultimately not what he 
values most.
“I’m appreciative, especially 
from coaching colleagues, but 
at the end of the day I’ve never 
put a whole lot of value in that. 
If anything, I factor that into 
one of the reasons it’s time for 
me to be done — there’s a lot of 
coaches out there that respect 
me and our program, and 
competing against them has 
been different for me the last 
few years because some of them 
are like friends. And,” Harper 
said, chuckling, “I’m not so sure 
that’s a good thing.”
I also jumped at the chance 
to ask Harper about one of 
the more intriguing bits of his 
biography — the time when, in 
1989, he coached two squads 
from the men’s team in a 
Guinness World Record-setting 
26-hour match of water polo 
at UCSD’s Natatorium next to Main Gym.
“Back then, when you did 
marathon records — I believe 
Guinness got rid of marathon 
records because people were 
literally dying trying to do 
them — for every hour that you 
did, you would get a ten-minute 
break. Well, that group I put 
together, which I specifically 
picked because I thought they 
were badasses, they could do 
three or four hours standing on 
their head. That was nothing, 
they’d done that under me.”
“We started at 1 o’clock, and 
around 5 or 6 — I had loosely 
known that there was a concert 
at the old Main Gym — it was 
Crowded House, an Australian 
band, they were a known thing 
in the late eighties. Well, most 
of the people in the band came 
in, poked their heads in. I have 
their signatures, because you 
also had to have a guestbook, 
so we had them sign the 
guestbook.”
“At some point in the concert, 
[the lead singer] talked about 
what was going on connected to 
the building, and consequently, 
when that thing let out around 
midnight, the Natatorium was 
packed with people. And it gave 
the guys an unbelievable energy 
surge… The crowd was there 
for maybe 30 minutes. And then 
they left. And then it was back 
to being just us, overnight, and 
now, ooh, 2 a.m., 3 a.m., 4 a.m. 
… Until the sun came up, it was 
pretty rough for those guys.”
After the record was set, 
there was a small gathering for 
the players and coaches. “The 
guys all came, but their hands 
were still gray and wrinkled. 
They looked like alien hands. 
All of them had green algae 
growing in their ears. After 
being here for 40 minutes they 
were pooped, so they left … I 
woke up around 12:30 or so, 
got up, took five or six steps, 
and both my hamstrings and 
calves cramped up like no 
tomorrow. I went down! Just 
totally cramped up from being 
up, standing, for over 40 hours, 
constantly moving.”
With decades of routine and 
experience in a job as rigorous 
as coaching, I asked Coach 
Harper how he plans on filling his days now that he’s retired, 
and whether he has anything 
lined up.
“I’m busy by nature, I’m not 
just going to be a couch potato. 
I will still be connected to this 
program, I’ll be its biggest fan 
… I don’t know what I’m going 
to do, but I know it’s going to be 
good. I don’t have any anxiety 
over it.”
Near the end of our 
interview, I told Coach Harper 
that his retirement reminded 
me of that of Duke University 
men’s basketball coach Mike 
Krzyzewski, who has had a 
prolonged farewell tour this 
season soured by two upset 
losses to heated rival University 
of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, 
the latter in the Final Four. 
We’ve known all season that 
Krzyzewski would retire, so 
every game was a moment 
of closure, every tournament 
game could have been his last. 
But Harper announced his 
retirement in the offseason, so 
he didn’t have any such farewell 
tour, and I asked him if this was 
intentional.
“That Krzyzewski thing 
was a bit of an influence for 
me,” Harper said. “… He’s an 
awesome coach, however, he and 
I differed on that. I did not want 
that. While there obviously is 
going to be a group of guys who 
can say ‘We played for Denny 
his last season,’ I did not want 
‘We’re the team that’s going to 
have to play for Denny.’ I would 
maintain that that was hard on 
the [Duke] players, I don’t think 
it was fair to the players … I’m 
glad the way that I did it.”
Harper says he’ll still be at 
Triton water polo games, and 
the men’s water polo program 
will continue to be a force under 
Ustaszewski. But the retirement 
of Coach Harper — among the 
most accomplished members of 
the entire UCSD community, 
and a link back to decades of 
campus history — represents 
the end of an era for Triton 
athletics as a whole.
