After being shut down on Feb. 18 by A.S. President 
Utsav Gupta in reaction to a controversial live broad-
cast of Koala TV , the Student-Run Television  station has been reapproved with a new charter. 
The A.S. Council voted on March 3 to reinstate the 
station with a new charter — one that prohibits live programming — as well as new name Triton Television. 
Vice President of Finance and Resources Peter 
Benesch and co-station manager Thomas Dadourian said the name change will help  to restore the station’s *;=)LUQV;QOV)OZMMUMV\

Amid multiple Day of Action demonstra-
tions on March 4, leaders of the Black Student Union announced that the UCSD administra-tion has agreed to their list of demands, and will work with the BSU to improve campus 
climate and increase diversity. 
According to BSU Vice Chair Fnann 
Keflezighi,  students have met periodically 
with administrators over the last two weeks — most recently, on March 1 — to share drafts of different plans and discuss how the demands could be implemented.
History professor Daniel Widener 
announced that the joint agreement had been signed during the March 4 rally, and thanked those who demonstrated over the past three weeks in support of the BSU.
“I want to say ‘Thank you’ to all the allies 
who have come out over the course of the past few weeks, ” Widener said. “The mass action, the rallies, the protests, the demonstrations, the rejection of the racist bullshit that people here have been suggesting, has focused the eyes of the United States on UC San Diego. ”

Staff Writer
Pothea ds clinging religiously 
to their medical-mari juana  cards 
can rest assure d: UCS D’s Center  
for Medicina l Canna bis Research  
released a study on Feb. 11 confirm -
ing weed as a legitimate  medical 
treatment.
According to J.H. Atkinson,  
co-dir
ector  at CMRC, canna bis can 
significant ly impro ve quality of life 
for patients  sufferin g neuropathic  
pain  — or,  pain  cause d by d amage to 
the nervous system from  spina l-cor d 
injuries or diseases  like diabetes and 
multiple sclerosis.
“The major findings were th
at 
for chronic neuropathic pain,  can-
nabis gave a good foun dation  — or  
good pain  relief — that  is roughly on 
par with the relief given by stan dard 
treatment, ” Atkinson said.
The findings are backed by fi ve 
clinica l trials and four pre-clinica l 
studies
 (meant  to test a product’s 
safet y before use on humans ). In 
these  trials, subjects w ith either HIV-
related or neuropathic pain  smoked 
canna bis cigarettes, or joints, at vary-
ing concentrat
ions.  
“Fifty percent of the patients  in 
one trial had a pain  reduction of 30 
percent or more,  and that 30-percent  
reduction is known to be clinica lly 
important  because  it’s associate d with 
a better q uality of life,“ A tkinson said.
According to Atkinso n, chronic  
pain  is a serious  affliction for those  
sufferin g lon g-term  diseases,  and 
can prevent them  from  carrying out 
everyday activities. For examp le, 
patients  with multiple sclerosis expe-
rience d isabling pain  and musc le 
spasms,  which co
uld eventua lly 
deprive them  of their ability to walk. 
“[One  of the] findings was with 
the specificit y of multiple sclerosis, ” Atkinson said. “Canna bis provided 
moderate pain  relief for the musc le 
spasms. ” 
The study
 demonstrate d that can-
nabis was just as effecti ve as painkillers 
or pain relievers in treatin g neuropath -
ic pain.  In addition, the trials revealed 
that mari juana ’s efficienc y does  not 
depen d on how much  tetroh ydrocan -
nabinol — th
e main  active component  
of canna bis — the  patient  consumes.
“Low doses of canna bis were just 
as effecti ve as higher doses, ” Atkinson  
said.
In a secon d study, healthy subjects 
were injected with capsaicin — the  
“hot” ingredient in chili pe ppers  — to  
induce pain  after  the subjects had 
smoked canna bis cigarettes. T he 
results proved a narro w therapeutic  
range for concentrations of THC: 
Whi le low doses of THC di d not 
alleviate the effects of the capsaicin,  
higher doses act
ually increase d the 
amount  of pain  subjects felt.
“There is a narro w therapeutic  
window — that  is, a concentration of 
THC in the bloodstream  — that  was 
therapeutic, w hereas  all concentra -
tion above or below that amount  were 
not,” Atkinson said. 
This finding suggests tha
t the use 
of canna binoids as a pain  reliever 
is comp lex, and does  not follow the 
mechanism  of known pain  relievers 
such  as morphine  or aspirin.
The participants  were unknow-
ingly g iven cigarettes  with or with out 
THC to contro l for the placebo effect  
— a phenomenon  where subjects 
convince themse lves they are feeling 
less pain  just because  they think they 
have consume d medicine.  The stud-
ies showed a significant reduction  
in pain  with THC co mpare d to the 
placebo.
The use of canna bis as a therapeu -
tic substance  has been conteste d in 
both the scientific and political com -munities  due to its stron g psychologi-
cal effects, and relatively unknown 
physiological ones.  
THC alters p
erception, cognitive 
contro l, emotions, memor y and other  
psychological aspects. I t can also 
cause  anxiety, paranoia  and increase d 
suscepti bility to psychosis.  
Due to the toxic and carcino genic 
wastes  emitte d from  cigarettes, the 
smoking of joint
s also has obvious 
health risks, including lung and heart  
diseases.  
A cleaner  alternati ve to a joint or a 
bong known as a “volcano ” vapori zes 
canna bis with heat to release its THC 
— which can the n be inha led without  
the carcino gens and toxic wastes  from 
cigarettes.  
Though vapori zer trials have not 
been comp leted, preliminar y CM CR 
studies show that vapori zers allow for 
the same  amount  of THC to  circu late 
the system as mari juan a cigarettes.  Friday, Feb. 26

Like the many of you who 
haven’t yet succumbed to the real world of hard deadlines 
and meals that don’t come in a box, I’m a highly skilled procrastina-tor. My unwillingness — inability, perhaps — to do things in a timely 
manner has historically ensured a 
number of things in life, ranging from a ‘B’ in British lit (gasp!) to a color-coded closet (well, OK, maybe there’s another reason for that). Until the other night, though, never had my penchant for procrastina-tion offered me anything nearly so frightening as the intent gaze of a fif-tysomething guy with a full orchard of chest hair, head resting gently on his pillow. 
Let me explain. On Thursday night, while most 
of my friends were out making hazy memories in Pacific Beach, I had the great fortune of staying in to write two papers — both overdue, thank you very much — sometime before the sun rose or the last of the Redbull wore off. After almost an hour of exerted effort, a hard-earned study break was certainly in order — but with my polos still arranged in perfect rainbow order, my news feed devoid of any photo thumbnails worth clicking and my stomach already well past Nutter Butter capacity, I resorted to the one stalling mechanism surpassed in des-peration only by flossing or clipping my toenails: AOL Instant Messenger. 
After a few minutes catching 
up with one of my oldest friends, it was revealed that she’ d forged an unlikely bond with someone from Bulgaria who was on the rebound and conveniently built like a Greek god. She said they’ d been introduced by something called Chat Roulette — which, evidently, is not a virtual

<PM;M`7NNMVLMZ6M`\,WWZQUICKTAKESThe past three weeks of race 
rallies notwithstanding, it’s pretty rare for most on this 
campus to care about something enough to band together and get noticed.            
So when Library Walk reached 
max capacity last Thursday, filled with students and faculty members protesting fee hikes, budget cuts, acts of racism and myriad other problems within the university, we felt a monumental shift from the routine air of apathy. Comparable to the Vietnam War protests —  UCSD’s pinnacle of glory for any nostalgic activist — the Day of Action was the largest rally UCSD has seen since the 1960s.
Whereas the Sept. 24 walkout 
tended to confuse and alienate potential student participants by opting for angry chants over edu-cational dialogue, last Thursday’s efforts, though jumbled, focused on enlightening onlookers. Organizers provided students with informa-tional pamphlets on the roots of the university’s financial crisis — an important measure to ensure that 
participants know the basics of the issues, so that those students who do choose to be part of the rally aren’t merely doing so for an excuse to ditch class. 
Also of 
note is the fact that the Day of 
Action was not confined to Library Walk. Later in the afternoon, stu-dents and faculty shuttled their picket signs to Balboa Park to con-tinue the protest. While our collec-tive off-campus efforts weren’t as awesome or eye-catching as those of UC Davis students, who were arrested for attempting to block a freeway entrance, or UC Santa Cruz students, whose protests resulted in a campus shutdown, we’re proud of the protesters who continued on at Balboa Park Thursday afternoon.
Reprioritizing public education 
in the state legislature will be no easy feat — and certainly not one that we can expect to realize without ample taxpayer support. In mov-ing our cause away from campus, we attracted the attention of com-munity members who probably haven’t felt the tangible effects of our deteriorating public education sys-tem — a group whose support will be crucial in ensuring we receive the state funding we need at the voting booth. 
That said, as is inevitable with 
such a large and diverse group, a lesser degree of ignorance and indirectness was still present last Thursday. One prominent speaker, to the crowd’s applause, decried the fact that the university has contin-

No one wants to live next door to a sex offender — but not all those on the sex-registry list are as menacing as you think. 
After being convicted of rape, there’s no doubt that James 
Donnelly is a dangerous sex offender. But regulations like California’s minimum-distance law, which creates a 2,000-foot buffer between homes of sex offenders and schools or parks, also apply to those who have committed much lesser offenses. 
In California, you can be placed on the sex-offender registry 
even for mooning someone or peeing in public. By classifying minor infractions as “sex offenses, ” the goal of Jessica’s Law is diluted.
Similarly, Megan’s Law was intended to create a database to pro-
tect communities from dangerous sex offenders — but a college stu-dent who streaked across the field during a football game shouldn’t 
be lumped in the same category with the real sickos. As unpopular 
an initiative as it may be, California lawmakers need to reassess what constitutes a “sex offense. ” Our current standards encompass any-thing and everything remotely related to indecency, grouping teenage mistakes alongside lifelong obsessions with naked four-year-olds. Jessica’s Law also often forces sex offenders to be pushed into the same part of a city. California is unfairly punishing milder wrongdo-ers by branding them with the worst of labels, for life.
— Cheryl Hori
Associate Opinion Editor  Despite the fact that there’s a convicted sex offender liv-ing across the street from the local elementary school, 
Piedmont’s police force is absurdly lax on the issue, claiming that the situation is being dealt with and Donnelly is expected to relocate soon. 
But such a glaring oversight should be cause for major con-
cern. The 2,000-foot parameter established by Jessica’s Law is in place for a reason: to protect children from potentially risky scenarios, and provide less incentive for prior offenders. Such carelessness on the part of the Piedmont police force implies an underlying margin for further disregard of dangerous situations, exposing community members to perfectly avoidable danger in their own neighborhood. 
Though the Alameda County district attorney and the state 
attorney general consider Jessica’s Law unenforceable — a huge problem itself — allowing sex offenders to choose their neigh-borhood without consideration of the law pushes well-founded community concerns to the wayside. Confining offenders to one part of the already crammed Bay Area might give the impression of a makeshift penitentiary, but given the alternative — of allow-ing them to live near schools — is certainly the lesser of two evils. 
— Neda Salamat
Staff WriterJames Donnelly, the registered sex offender and new neighbor of Wildwood Elementary School, in Piedmont, is the official 
guinea pig of a law that never quite reached puberty. Jessica’s Law — mandated in 2006 after its nine-year-old namesake was raped and murdered by a convicted sex offender — requires a minimum 2,000-foot distance separating the residence of a sex offender from any school in California. 
But this alleged step in the right direction to safeguard kids 
from regular perverts has proven to be in the case of Donnelly, 
nothing much more than a crinkled bulletin board memo that 
even the government is shrugging off.
Creating a law with no explicit consequences for violation is 
useless for obvious reasons. If no one’s going to get cuffed, what’s stopping the nearest kiddie-porn collector from moving next to a nest of preschoolers and choosing his next victim? The fact that no one is enforcing Jessica’s law — as evidenced by the fact that the Piedmont sex offender is still a leisurely stroll away from Wildwood’s gates — is a cause for nationwide concern. If proper punishments isn’t built into the law — and it could be as simple 
as an eviction notice — another child could be hurt — and we 
won’t be able to say we did all we could to prevent the situation.

form of the lethal Russian game of 
chance, but an excuse for strangers to make meaningful conversation or show you their penis. 
Naturally, I was signed on within 
minutes. My friend had warned me that ChatRoulette.com — which allows users to video chat with per-fect strangers — was a little different for guys than it was for her, but sure-ly that wouldn’t stop me from meet-ing a charming Eastern European all my own within 10 minutes. Y ou can’t hurry love, but I was in no particular rush.
After a passing period’s worth of 
failure, though, I found my friend couldn’t have made a bigger under-statement in noting the Web site was “different” for guys: It’s configured to automatically connect you to another user’s Web cam, but also provides the option of a “Next” but-ton, should that stranger’s broadcast be unsatisfactory. It’s a useful tool, especially when you come across a pixilated stream of someone shield-ing his face with a handwritten sign reading “Boobs?”
Most of the matches I came 
across in my extended study break were, like me, young, male and apparently looking for something highly specific. There were, however, a couple noted exceptions, such as the aforementioned fiftysomething, whose coy grin I only discovered after several minutes away from the page — and took as an irrefutable sign that it was high time I got back to that Spanish paper. 
After those fleeting minutes of 
creeped-out observation and half-hearted hope, though, it occurred to me that even if the Internet can connect me with a saggy 50-year-old in five minutes flat it’s not exactly the most lucrative procrastination pit stop. I’ve got a towering pile of clean clothes to worry about before I dare start on whatever paper’s due next, but I think that next time, before I resort to Chat-Roulette desperation and risk another unintended stare-down, I’ll take on the sock drawer instead.

▶ END, from page 4 
Dear Editor,
As a current UCSD student, I am 
saddened to see the behavior on cam-pus over the past two weeks — by all of the parties involved.   
What was originally intended as a 
tongue-in-cheek social event has been latched onto by an overly sensitive and zealous group of minority students, a weak faculty, sensationalist media  and 
more misguided reactionaries.  
All of these parties add further 
flame to an ever-growing firestorm of bad press directed toward our great university, while the rest of the student body sits back in disbelief.
It is time to stop the growing 
national media storm denouncing our school, the cries of victim and “rac-ism, ” a pathetically late response by our faculty and staff and, most impor-
tantly, the inappropriate and insensi-tive actions of a few juvenile students on campus. 
The Black Student Union’s 
response prompted Chancellor Marye Anne Fox to send out a campuswide e-mail condemning the event, yet allowing her to side step punishing the parties involved for the behavior. This was perhaps a bad choice as well. Before these two responses, the event was relatively below the radar. The BSU’s reaction and Fox’s letter thus prompted the now-infamous retalia-tory Koala TV broadcast.  
While allegedly using the offensive 
terminology of “ungrateful niggers” to condemn the BSU’s uproar, the Koala ’s  
diatribe was historically no different from other previously juvenile satires of other minorities and majorities alike. The “Compton lynching” sign later recovered by police most likely referred to the social lynching the BSU was attempting against the fraternities in question, and it was not intended as a threat against the black community.  
The Koala  broadcast has only 
emboldened the BSU and various fac-ulty members to speak or act out, and this has escalated the national media attention on UCSD.
And, again, a cycle of action, reac-
tion and overreaction has occurred.
The crowd went wild when a stu-
dent hung a noose. This draws in the authorities and even more national media attention. Thus, the student confesses. But the twist is that she is a minority and apologizes. She is still suspended — but is she racist?
The crowd goes wild again, which 
in turn prompts someone else to act out. And we are now left with a Ku Klux Klan hood on our beloved Dr. Seuss statue. These escalations are growing on what should have always originally been a non-issue.  
What is happening on our campus 
is a cycle of insensitivity and stupidity, overreaction and attention and acting out by both sides again and again.    
An intended parody has brought 
us into the national spotlight, and as these actions become more absurd and extreme, we run the risk of a real danger or violence on our campus, as the UCSD name is drawn through the mud.
When you have a college consist-
ing of diverse backgrounds, someone at sometime is bound to be offended about something. 
But for the sake and dignity of 
UCSD as a community, we need to 
move on. We have an amazing school with a diverse set of students and faculty, and I have never felt a hint of racism before these past weeks.
Let’s stop this cycle now.

Dear Editor,
Thanks to Cheryl Hori for her 
review of the Carnival Cruise to 
Mexico. I will pass it along to the 500-plus members of the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute on campus, so they’ll know what to avoid. W e are all “teeter-ing between retirement and death” and have lost our interest in spending time with drunks under 21 who get off on smuggling cheap booze in their back-packs. Please send more of her reviews! I do have to say that, for this geezer at least, the other travel articles were informative, respectful and inspired me to get off my rocker and explore — especially Uganda and the Amazon. Sincere thanks for those.

Dear Editor,
I’ve been working at the Shiley 
Eye Center since June 2008. When I started, I was appalled to learn that 
there is no recycling program here. I did everything I could to try to have one set up: I contacted UCSD’s sustainability group, facilities  and the 
person in charge of Shiley. They all met to discuss how to start a recycling program, but nothing ever came of it. Y ou wouldn’t believe how much paper is just thrown away here every day; it’ s truly unbelievable. I get so frustrated when I hear UCSD saying how green it is when the east side of campus is so wasteful. Last time I looked into it, I couldn’t find out whether or not Thornton Hospital or Moores Cancer Center has a recycling program. I’m writing you this in hopes that raising awareness of this problem can some-how help things get done here.

ued with on-campus construction projects despite our financial crisis — avoiding the fact that the money used to fund construction projects is set aside for highly specific purposes and cannot legally be used to cur-tail fee increases. Others still toted their “Lay off Yudof ” signs from Fall Quarter, evidently oblivious of the fact that our university’s problems run far deeper than one high-paid suit with a corner office in Oakland. 
Of course, it wouldn’t be a cam-
pus protest if comprised solely of well-informed, passionate dissenters. What’s more important is that the campus community turned out in such record numbers. A small, dis-organized faction of rabble rousers interrupting lectures won’t intimi-date the UC Regents or state law-makers — but an enormous assem-bly of pissed-off students and faculty members might just raise enough of a ruckus to shake Sacramento. 
Let’s not forget that on the same 
day of the protest, the Black Student Union announced that after two weeks of fighting, it had finally reached an agreement with the administration regarding its list of demands in response to a series of racist events on campus. We need look no further for evidence that a peaceful, organized expression of indignation can yield tangible results — and that’s precisely why our momentum can’t stop here. 
A single nationwide day of action 
is a noble start. In order to main-tain UC accessibility and quality, students and faculty members can’t simmer down — not until state leg-islators, the regents and the voting body of California recognize that we’re a force to be reckoned with.

Keflezighi also spoke about the importance 
of diversity in the undergraduate popula-
tion and the difficulties faced by historically underrepresented students.
“When we get here, we need to feel com-
fortable, ” she said. “I come here to be a stu-dent, but the reality is I’m not a student first, I’m an activist first, and I think the university needs to understand that. ”
Keflezighi said all the BSU demands were 
met.
“We fought hard for all our demands, but 
the one we’re especially proud of is matching funds for S.P .A.C.E.S., ” she said.
S.P .A.C.E.S., or the Student Promoted 
Access Center for Education and Service, is a collaborative area in the Cross-Cultural Center designed to empower minorities.
In implementing the demands, the admin-
istration has created two task forces: one to recruit minority faculty and another to find ways to improve the student-body climate to be friendlier for minorities.
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox agreed to 
fund BSU-initiated yield programs —  which will work to ensure that more black students enroll and graduate —  for at least the next three years, and fill the program-coordinator position for the African-American studies minor  and the Chicano/a and Latino/a arts and humanities minor.
Administrators also promised to establish 
a resource center for black, Chicano and Native-American communities, and do all they can toward returning ancient Native-American remains found o n  c a m p u s  g r o u n d s  t o  t h e  Kumeyaay nation.
Chancellor Fox and Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny Rue could not be reached for comment.
UC President Mark Yudof 
and Fox announced on March 5 that Dean of UC Berkeley School of Law Christopher Edley has been appointed to advise UCSD on improving its campus climate.
Edley said he will meet with 
the administration and BSU members on March 9. 
“Through these and subse-
quent meetings, [we] will devel-op a plan for how I might be useful, ” he said. “It depends on what people believe they need in light of what’s already been agreed, and we’ll take it from there. I definitely will not be providing legal counsel in the for-mal sense. ” 
Former UC Regent Ward Connerly will 
also review UCSD’s plan of action to deter-
mine if it violates the California Constitution. 
Connerly, who founded the American Civil Rights Institute, helped pass Proposition 209 in 1996, which prohibits the consideration of sex and race in UC admissions.
“We have attorneys as part of our entourage 
to review the plan and determine if it complies with Prop. 209, ” Connerly said. “We’re primar-ily interested in if preferential treatment is being accorded for black students. ”Connerly stressed that it is not wrong for 
the university to make steps toward increasing campus diversity. 
“There’s no problem with the university 
reaching out to make sure everyone, regard-
less of ethnicity, is encouraged to apply and receive equal treatment, ” he said. “But the university cannot take action designed to give someone preference — for example, in hiring faculty or in admis-sions — based on race. ”
Connerly said he has no 
timeline for the review, but in his preliminary opinion, the university’s plans are ques-tionable, but not illegal. 
“Personally, I think it’s 
distasteful for the universi-ty, under duress, to sit down with a group of students rep-resenting racial interest and agree to their demands, ” he said. “What about white stu-
dents, what if they want more 
diversity? But that’s not a legal issue, that’s just inappropri-
ate public-policy making. They can make promises all they want, but they don’t violate anything until they take action. ”
Keflezighi said that, despite recent prog-
ress, the BSU still has work to do.
“This isn’t a victory, ” said Keflezighi. “This 
is a step toward victory, but there’s a whole lot 
of work, language and charters that need to be 
written. We’re nowhere near victory. ”

mentation can be found online at www.battle-

Students affected by recent campus tur-
moil can now petition to withdraw from their 
Winter Quarter classes without receiving a ‘W’ on their transcript. 
The policy was approved by the UCSD 
Committee of Educational Policy on March 2, then announced to the student body via e-mails from the college provosts. In addition, students who have already withdrawn from one or more classes can petition to have those ‘W’s  removed from their transcipts.
According to CEP Chair Stefan Llewellyn-
Smith, students must first work with both their academic counselor and college provost to discuss other academic options. They must then file an Undergraduate Student Petition to withdraw without a ‘W , ’ explaining why with-drawal is necessary and how academic work has been negatively affected. The committee will approve requests only after students have followed all these steps.Both Llewellyn-Smith and James Levin, vice 
chair of the CEP , said the special policy was created to offer students academic flexibility in light of racial tensions on campus, including three protests during Week Eight. 
Llewellyn-Smith said the committee, which 
hashed out the policy over e-mail, was unani-mously in favor of offering students the chance to remove their ‘W’s. 
“These are important requests that don’t just 
come out of blue, ” he said. “They’re not arbi-trary constructs. This is for students in unusual, exceptional situations. ”
Llewellyn-Smith and Levin agreed the 
option should be a last resort. 
“We hope that students can find an alternate 
to this since they would be losing the quarter, ” Levin said. “We really want students to find other options and work with their counselors before turning to this. But if all else fails, we hope this will reduce the stress level of the students. ”
Llewellyn-Smith has approved one request 
so far, and said he may receive more in the coming week. 
Although the regular deadline to withdraw 
from specific courses passed on March 5, the deadline to withdraw from all classes without a ‘W’ has been extended to Friday, March 12.

History professor Daniel Widener announced at the March 4 
rally that the administration had agreed to the BSU’s demands.8 THE UCSD GUARDIAN  MONDAY , MARCH 8, 2010  NEWS
Los Angeles and Sacramento, walkouts 
at high schools and community col-leges and a demonstration at each UC campus.
The UCSD turnout was about 800, 
tying with UC Berkeley and outnum-bering the other eight UC campuses, which reported turnouts of 300 to 500 people. A.S. Campuswide Senator and rally organizer Bryant Pena attributed this to the recent activism against rac-ism on campus.
“The racial incidents helped mobi-
lize our community and the rest of campus in response of what hap-pened, ” Pena said.  “When I was on stage in front of Geisel, I couldn’t see where the amount of people ended on Library Walk. ”
The demonstration was coor-
dinated by the UCSD Coalition for Educational Justice and the Student Affirmative Action Committee.
The morning started with a Black 
Student Union rally at the Chancellor’s Complex, followed by a Faculty Press Conference in the Cross-Cultural Center. At 11:30 a.m., students and teachers walked out of their class-rooms to gather at Gilman Parking Structure, where they marched to a rally in front of Geisel Library.
At about 1:30 p.m., buses began 
shuttling protesters to Balboa Park, 
where UCSD protestors joined a group 
of 2,000 more for the All San Diego Rally and marched to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s San Diego office.
Though no one was arrested at 
UCSD’s protest, about 150 protesters at Berkeley’s event — including 37 students — were arrested after block-ing off the Interstate Highway 880, according to student-run newspa-
per the Daily Cal . Berkeley students 
also joined a crowd of 10,000 in San 
Francisco — the largest demonstration in the state.
At UC Santa Cruz, protestors 
blocked all traffic from entering and exiting the campus from 6 a.m. into the afternoon. UCSC officials released a “safety warning” that shut down the campus until 4:45 p.m.
Ralliers at UC Davis also tried to 
block the freeway, but met a blockade of 120 police officers that prevented them from making their way onto the Interstate 80. The protest dispersed after police fired pepper spray into a crowd of about 300 people and arrest-ed one student, according to student-run newspaper the Aggie .
California wasn’t the only state 
up in arms; over 100 demonstrations were held across the nation. According to the student-run University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Post , 16 pro-
testors at UWM were arrested when police turned them away from an administrative building and students became violent, throwing punches and chunks of ice.
At UCSD, in an effort to educate 
students during the weeks leading up to the Day of Action, a campaign called “Let This Be Public Now” — organized by graduate students in the visual-arts department — provided informational flyers offering support to the BSU, the Coalition for Educational Justice and other systemwide initiatives. The flyers covered the effects of the California funding cuts on the UC system.
The campaign culminated on 
March 4, where supporters like visual-arts graduate student Artie Vierkant wove through the crowd, taping fly-
ers to streetlamps and walls, handing 
pamphlets to people walking by. 
The UCSD rally in front of Geisel 
was emceed by Chevelle Newell — a 
member of the BSU — and Pena. Performances included a spoken-word and dance piece by the Art Collective, along with speeches from students, staff and professors. 
“Today is about everyone coming 
out, showing support for change and 
that we’re actually going to go forth 
with action, ” Art Collective performer and Revelle College freshman Shunya Wade said. “We’re not just talking any-more about being upset with things, but actually coming with solutions to table and saying ‘This is what we want to happen, ’ and we will continue to 
fight for it until it does happen. ” 
Eleanor Roosevelt College senior 
Jake Blanc, a representative from the UCSD Coalition for Educational Justice, listed the coalition’s five demands — including access to public higher education, respect for univer-sity workers, transparency in drafting university budgets and a change to the composition of the UC Board of Regents. He said the board should be renamed the “People’s Board of Representatives of the University of California” and replace its governor-appointed members with three under-graduates, two graduate students and five faculty members. 
Lincoln High School freshman 
Vanessa Bandith joined 80 of her classmates to march alongside UCSD students at the campus protest.  
“I’m here to fight for my education 
in the future, to be able to go to college without any worries, ” Bandith said. 
UCSD groundskeeper Jorge Olvera 
and carpenter David Roger also marched to protect higher education. 
“We are supporting our brothers 
and sisters in different community colleges, ” Olvera said. “Our fight is the same fight. Our university system has a great impact on the state. It’s critical that the community that we are part of understands how critical it is for us to take it to the streets. ”
At 5:12 p.m., the downtown-San 
Diego crowd sat in the street parallel to the front entrance to the governor’s 
office. Speakers — including Revelle 
College senior Sam Jung and Marshall College freshman Grant White — addressed the crowd, as police cars blocked off the streets.
“ As one of the organizers, I was 
incredibly happy, ” Pena said. “It’s defi-nitely one of the biggest things we’ve seen on this campus. Most of the orga-nizers are in the Student Affirmative 
Action Committee, and to see the rest 
of campus and folks from the universi-ty community involved was amazing. ”

“ A lot of people were offended by 
what happened that Thursday some 
weeks ago, and keeping that same tag on the station would be like say-ing ‘Hey, this is more of the same, ’” Dadourian said. “We really wanted to make sure that students knew that was not what the Associate Students’ television network is all about. ”
Benesch said that, in light of the 
Feb. 18 broadcast, the ban on live content is necessary.
“We did have station managers in 
the past approving content that went on the air, ” Benesch said. “There were a lot of problems with that, though. Basically, individuals could — one way or another — gain access to the facility by saying that they have the approval of the station managers. ”
Dadourian agreed that the old 
system was ineffective.
“It was horribly defunct and con-
tained positions that never really existed, like operations manager, ” he said. 
In addition to nixing live pro-
gramming, TTV’s charter places heavier restrictions on students look-ing to broadcast new material. TTV hopefuls must first find a “producer” — an SRTV member trained to over-see content — to sponsor their show, then run the concept past station managers Dadourian and Ali Hadian for approval. 
If future content is deemed 
questionable, it will be presented to the Program Review Panel — co-chaired by Dadourian and Hadian — which includes Gupta, Associate Vice President of Student Services Meredith Madnick, two TTV offi-cers, one producer unaffiliated with the station and two A.S. senators. 
The PRP reserves the right, along 
with the station managers, to reject a show’s proposal. However, anyone is welcome to appeal the PRP’s decision at the next A.S. Council meeting. Once the show is approved, produc-ers are responsible for individually monitoring each episode’s content to prevent the airing of controversial material.
The station has a long history 
of controversy and censorship. In 2005, it was shut down after Koala TV creator Steve Y ork made national headlines by airing a video of himself having sex with an adult-film actress.
Benesch said TTV’s new charter 
mandates far more A.S oversight.
“The [charter] was literally 
scrapped and started from scratch, ” Benesch said. “In the past, we didn’t give the station editor much direc-tion. The new system is explained in much better detail. ”
The charter’s broadcast rules 
prohibit airing obscene material — defined as  anything depicting or describing sexual content in an offensive manner and lacking in lit-erary, artistic, political or scientific value. Indecent material — obscene, sexual or excretory — is also banned from airing between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m.
Benesch considers these new 
restrictions practical, seeing as TTV is the A.S. Council’s official station.
“[The council] decides what it will 
say — this isn’t some venue where all students can come and say whatever it is they feel like they want to say on television, ” he said. “Basically, it’s a venue where by Associated Students is communicating with the general students. Associated Students is cen-soring itself. ”
As a result, Dadourian said he 
doubts that Koala TV will ever reap-pear.
“I’m sad that a media organiza-
tion is banned, but based on our current history, it’s probably in TTV’s best interest, ” Dadourian said.
Despite the restrictions, 
Dadourian said he hopes to bring delayed programming — which puts off a live stream for a small amount of time — to TTV .
 “We still aren’t sure [if there will 
be delayed television] … We’re trying to do some creative financing and minimize costs as much as possible, ” he said. 
Dadourian said that TTV will 
launch during Week One of Spring Quarter. He said hopes to implement a new advertising campaign, logo and Web site along with the launch.
“I kind of feel sad SRTV’s gone, 
but at the same time, I’m excited to get a new opportunity, ” he said. “Hopefully this new system will legit-imize us. ”

of THC was very comparable — a 
vaporizer did just as well to deliver THC as a cigarette, ” Atkinson said. 
Politically, the use of cannabis 
— whether through cigarettes or a vaporizer — has been highly con-tested since the federal Marihuana Tax Act first made the drug illegal in 1937. 
Currently, policymakers like 
Michele Leonhardt, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, worry that dispensaries — pharmacies that specifically distribute medical marijuana — would open the door to more widespread use of illegal drugs. 
Though medical marijuana is 
illegal under federal law and the DEA frequently raids dispensaries, 12 states — including California — allow dispensaries to distribute cannabis to those with medical-marijuana cards. These cards, which can be prescribed to a patient by a physician, state that the patient needs marijuana to help treat symptoms like pain or insomnia.
Because THC remains in fat cells 
for approximately one month, poli-cymakers are also concerned about marijuana’s effects on driving ability. Studies at the Lakehead University in Ontario have shown that cannabis 
impairs motor skills.
Though UCSD scientists con-
trolled the exact amount of THC in the cigarettes they administered, Atkinson said that doctors at dispen-saries do not know the concentration of THC in the goods they distribute, which makes it difficult to prescribe. As the study shows, too much THC can actually increase pain.
“I do not think that you can take 
our results and apply them directly to what is available to the streets or in dispensaries, ” Atkinson said.

TIOGA HALL
1early 10,000 years after three tribal fishermen were buried in what is now 
the ritzy enclave of La Jolla Farms — just west of the Muir College campus — their bones have yet to find a final resting place.
Ever since the remains were uncovered by archeology students from 
Cal State Northridge in 1976, the UCSD administration and the Kumeyaay 
nation — an American-Indian tribe that hails from Southern California and Northern Mexico — have been fighting over the rights to the bones. Though the two parties reached a stalemate last year after the university refused to deem the remains “culturally affiliated” with the Kumeyaay nation, recent unrest on campus has rekindled the dispute. 
The Black Student Union’s list of demands, released three weeks ago to 
address racial insensitivity at UCSD, included a request that the university cooperate with the Kumeyaay nation. Now, in a joint statement with the BSU on Mar. 4, Chancellor Marye Anne Fox has pledged a commitment to continue working toward a resolution with the Kumeyaay nation.
The bones are some of the oldest ever found in the Western Hemisphere. 
They were unearthed from the land beneath Chancellor Fox’s University House — purchased by UCSD in 1967 as an official residence for chancel-lors, and to host events and fundraisers. Though Fox doesn’t actually live in the house (NAGPRA) it was deemed structurally unsound in 2004), it’s been a site of heated contention between the university and the Kumeyaay nation.
Because the Northridge archeology students discovered the remains on university 
property, they are currently under UC control — stored in a safe at the San Diego Archaeological Center in Escondido. Since their discovery, the artifacts have been shipped to various locations across the country, displayed at prestigious museums like the Smithsonian and studied with particular scrutiny for their age — all amid pleas by local American-Indians to have the ancestral remains returned and reburied. 
According to the Native-American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 
1990, all institutions that receive federal funding must return American-Indian cul-tural artifacts and human remains when a tribe can prove “cultural affiliation. ”
The law stipulates that an artifact is culturally affiliated with a tribe’s heritage if 
there is evidence of a connection “based on geographical, kinship, biological, archeo-logical, linguistic, folklore, oral tradition, historical evidence or other information or expert opinion. ”
The Kumeyaay Cultural Repatriations Committee — a group formed by the San 
Diego County Kumeyaay tribes in 1998 — submitted a request to UCSD administra-tors in 2006 asking for the remains to be reburied, claiming they were Kumeyaay ancestors. According to members of the committee, though 29 sets of bones were dug up in 1976, only the three in question are accounted for. 
Two years later in 2008, the university put together a faculty panel of two anthro-

Take a smooth bike ride down Expedition Way off North 
Torrey Pines Road, and you’ll find yourself gazing up at a 10-foot seascape, painted behind an even larger 
whale sculpture. The entrance to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography’s Birch Aquarium — directly across from the Splash Cafe, with ample bike parking alongside it — feeds into a large gallery. A swarm of volunteers await you there, hoping for a chance to spew infinite knowledge on the aquarium’s exhibits — including the Hall of Fishes, the Scripps Explorers Gallery on Climate Change and the Education Courtyard. 
A dark hallway just to the right of the Pacific Sardine tank 
— thick with shimmering, silver-scaled fish — will lead you into the Hall of Fishes. Here, leopard sharks, iridescently orange girabaldi fish and octopi serve as appetizers for the main course: a 13,000-gallon kelp forest from floor to ceiling, filled to the brim with stingrays, shovel-nose guitar fish and an awesome 400-pound bass. 
The majority of the Hall of Fishes is devoted to sea life from 
California coastal habitats, from the Pacific Northwest to Baja. But if you’re looking for a getaway, skip the local educational displays and check out the small aquarium section devoted to tropical specimen.
Or, those hoping to unleash their inner fourth-grader can 
take a field trip to the tide pools to gawk at some of the slimier ocean stuffs. Goobery sea cucumbers, scuttling hermit crabs and bright seastars are all within arm’s reach. And even in the off-chance that the pools aren’t so hoppin’ , an authentic, brisk 
ocean breeze makes it cool to be chill. 
The aquarium’s third wing 
focuses on recent research from Scripps, with interactive displays and games for all those visitors who are actually four-year-olds. To avoid a trail of sticky fingers, escape to the “2050 Television Newsroom, ” where you can broadcast your own weather report and prediction of what the world may be like in the future.
But if you become overwhelmed with mental images of 
a barren planet, seek refuge in the next display: “There’s Something About Seahorses. ” Though the aquarium’s new-est exhibit is only about a quarter of the size of the fishes hall, its freakish beauty makes up for it. 
If you’ve only seen seahorses in National Geographic 
spreads, you’ll be shocked to learn how small these peculiar creatures are: The dwarf species measures just over half an inch. The Scripps’ captive-breeding portion of the exhibit contains three tanks with tiny baby seahorses tightly clasping their tails to blades of grass in simulated current. Even better is the exhibit’s finale — a tank full of stunning sea dragons. If you had been mindlessly wandering, the dragon display will give the trip its sense of purpose. Playing weird, mon-strous uncle to the seahorse, the dragons are orange- and red-striped creatures with translucent leaf-like appendages protruding from every angle of their bodies.
Cool down with the few remaining tanks filled with some 
of Birch Aquarium’s best and brightest — like the red- and yellow-striped pipefish or the Pacific Spiny Lumpsucker — who could double as a ping-pong-ball.

Though it may not turn you 
into the next Bobby Flay, the Cuisine Club can help you 
become less dependent on your regular Chipotle burrito. And it all started with sponge cake. While hunting for a recipe, Muir senior Frances Tang stumbled upon a link to the University of Washington’s Cuisine Club. Intrigued by the concept of a student org for food-ies, Tang founded a cooking club at UCSD by the end of last quarter. 
Though she doesn’t have very 
much time to advertise her culinary cause, the Facebook group Tang created has already attracted 461 members. 
“Many people who contacted me 
asking for information about the club were brand new to cooking, ” Tang said. “I know some people who can’t even operate a rice cooker. ” 
Along with fellow founding 
members Warren junior Robert Holm-Kennedy, Marshall senior Ryan Seely, Marshall junior Victor Chun and Muir senior Christopher Auyeung, Tang envisions the club as a laidback environment for food lovers to get together and learn new techniques and recipies. 
The club is organized into 
three main divisions: sampling different restaurants, holding culinary workshops and organizing potlucks that vary from comfort foods to foods of specific colors. The Cuisine Club’s next event will focus on creating pizzas and omelets according to different skillsets — from the amateur who burns water to the most seasoned epicure.
“It’s all about the members — 
we all learn together regardless of experience level, ” Tang said.
The Cuisine Club’s Facebook 
group showcases an impressive photo collection of dishes prepared by the club’s members so far.Their first event — an open potluck with one stipulation: No chips unless they’re homemade — was held a week before finals last quarter, and attracted around 10 to 15 attendees. People brought a diverse selection of foods, ranging from Spanish to Korean.

pologists, an ethnic-studies profes-sor and a retired professor from the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography to determine if the bones could be identi-fied as “culturally affiliated. ” The panel ultimately concluded there was no evidence of cultural affiliation between the remains and any living tribes.
“ Although there is evidence from 
material culture that people have lived in the San Diego region since the late Pleistocene or early Holocene, the linguistic analyses and archaeological evidence indicate that the Kumeyaay moved into the region within the last few thousand years, ” read the panel’s final report, released in May 2008.
In a statement made to the 
Guardian  in May 2009, spokesman for 
the KCRC Steve Banegas expressed his dissatisfaction with the panel’s conclu-sions. Banegas claimed the unique burial positions of the bodies in fact reflect an affiliation with the Kumeyaay culture. According to the KCRC, the position of one young man in par-ticular — curled up with two severed fingers placed in his mouth — was evi-dence of the tribe’s burial rituals.
“We know that they are cultur-
ally identifiable, ” Banegas said. “ All we want is to merely rebury them … respect them and treat them as the human beings that they once were. ”
Immediately following the panel’s 
report, Vice Chancellor of Resource Management and Planning Gary Matthews asked the UC Office of the President to recommend that the U.S. Department of the Interior — the branch of government officially in charge of Native American affairs — to return and rebury the bones. 
Ultimately, in early summer 2008, 
the university withdrew its request 
for repatriation due to lack of sup-port from the KCRC, which remained staunchly opposed to the panel’s clas-sification of the remains as “culturally unidentifiable. ”
Almost a year later, the issue of repatriation has returned to the spot-light. In late December 2009, UCSD administrators met with National NAGPRA Program Manager Sherry Hutt to discuss the university’s options. The immediate effects of this meeting are uncertain, but — according to Vice Chancellor of Research Art Ellis — the bones can only be returned if the faculty panel declares the bones to be affiliated with the Kumeyaay.
“UCSD supports the Kumeyaay 
nation’s request to have the remains discovered in 1976 repatriated. However, until federal law is changed to allow the remains to be repatriated even if they are not “culturally affili-ated” we are prohibited from doing so, ” Ellis said.
Ethnic-studies professor Ross 
Frank, the sole dissenter in the fac-ulty panel’s conclusion two years ago, echoed Ellis’ pessimism that the bones would be repatriated. 
“There are complicated things 
happening, ” Frank said. “ As long as the supposed archaeological value can be harvested from these human remains, there really isn’t any easy way to resolve this. ”
According to Frank, the panel’s 
conclusions on the cultural identity of the bones were biased by the fact that they remain scientifically valuable. 
On Feb. 5, Marshall College junior 
and AS AVP of Local Affairs Aries Rivers Yumul led a group of about 60 students on a march to the chan-cellor’s office, chanting “No debate, repatriate” with the goal of calling new attention to the issue.
Yumul, who is an American Indian 
student himself, collected over 100 signatures from students in favor of returning the bones to the Kumeyaay tribe, stressing to the Chancellor that they were indeed “culturally affili-ated. ” According to Yumul, as a result of the march, Chancellor  Fox and 
Vice Chancellor Matthews responded promptly via e-mail. 
“They really do understand how 
important [this issue] is to the student body, ” Yumul said.
Professor Frank, also present at the 
march, said that the repatriation is a concern of many students. 
“It’s about campus climate … the 
ability to attract Native-American students and about thinking through what the larger ethical and moral implications are of the university’s research actions, ” Frank said.
There are currently 90 American-
Indian students enrolled at UCSD, one of whom is Kumeyaay —only about 0.004% of the student body in a coun-ty housing more American-Indian res-ervations than any other in the U.S. 
“The fact that the university has 
remains of the native tribe is a deter-rent for many native students in the community, ” Yumul said.
The BSU recently made reference 
to the underrepresented American-Indian population in its Feb. 26 “State of Emergency” address, which includ-ed a list of demands toward creating a more minority-friendly campus.
“We stand in solidarity and strug-
gle with all other marginalized and underrepresented communities on the UCSD campus, which include but are not limited to our fellow Native-American and indigenous  brothers 
and sisters fighting for the repatriation of ancestral remains, ” the BSU stated. 
 With Chancellor Fox’s renewed 
verbal commitment to resolving the repatriation issue — in response to the community’s reinvigorated interest in the matter — it remains to be seen whether the years-long back-and-forth will finally end in peace.
 “In the future, any recovered 
archaeological artifacts will be coor-dinated with on-site Native-American monitors, ” Ellis said. “We also con-tinue to have  an open dialogue with 
the Native-American community as we move through this process. ”

6&,(1&('(*5((Unfortunately, the Tritons lost 
momentum in the fourth set. The 
Cardinals took advantage of this lag to claim a final 30-20 victory.
Although the match did not end 
as the Tritons had hoped, individual players still came out on top. Junior opposite hitter Joel Davidson led with 17 kills, sophomore opposite hitter Carl Eberts added 10 kills on .364 hitting and Kiani and freshman opposite hitter Alex Simon had nine kills each. Senior setter Erik Sierks contributed 34 assists and sophomore libero Andrew Kaban made eight digs.
The Tritons squared off against 
the University of the Pacific in Stockton on March 6. Coming off the previous night’s loss, the team was determined to turn things around. Hard work and steady momentum paid off when the Tritons defeated Stockton 31-29, 30-17, 33-35, 30-24. The victory marked the Tritons’ fifth consecutive win over the Tigers in as many meetings, bumping UCSD’s record to 6-23 overall and 3-11 in MPSF play.
The first set began as an even 
battle. After working hard to tie the set score at 24 apiece, the Tigers took the lead 29-28. However, UCSD managed to claim the hard-fought set after a triple block and a kill by Fritsch took the score to 31-29.
UCSD kept a steady pace to 
claim the second set 30-17.
Unexpectedly, the Tigers rallied 
to an early 7-1 lead in the third set. UCSD caught up momentarily to tie the score at 14-14; however Stockton emerged on top of a 35-33 score.
“We had opportunities to win 
the third set, but the loss was a heartbreaker, ” Ring said. “We didn’t want Pacific to gain momentum with the win, so we had to start off  with a quick lead. ”
Although the lead seesawed 
between the teams several times, the Tritons held on until the very end of the fourth set and claimed it 30-24, thanks to a kill by senior outside hitter Jason Spangler and a Tiger service error.
The win reflected strong 
individual performances from a few key players. Fritsch led with 19 kills, while junior middle blocker 
Adrian Guthals had 13 kills and nine blocks. Spangler contributed 13 kills and 11 digs. Kiani added 12 kills, and junior setter Phil Bannan led in assists with 58.
The Tritons will return to action 
when they travel to Romeoville, Ill., to face off against Lewis University on March 12 and March 13.

percent from the field, and were 8-of-12 on three-pointers in the second half.
“ Any time a team shoots that well 
from the three-point line, you’re going to have your hands full, ” head coach Charity Elliot said.
While Humboldt was on fire from 
beyond the arc, the Tritons were abysmal, hitting just two of 17 three-point attempts. 
Two Triton centers — junior 
Charity Smith and sophomore Lauren Freidenberg — combined for 18 points in the first half, keeping the team in the game despite a strong start from Humboldt. The Lumberjacks shot over 53 percent from the field in the first half, but thanks to the Triton post players, the teams went into the break with the score tied at 35. 
Smith finished with her first career 
double-double, tallying 13 points and 13 rebounds. Freidenberg posted 11 points and six rebounds.
Humboldt found its range in the 
second half, hitting multiple three pointers to widen the lead by as many as eight points. Ilg, who scored 17 of her 21 points in the second half and grabbed seven rebounds, kept the Tritons alive, converting a three-point play with 3:15 remaining to give the Tritons a short-lived 70-69 advantage.
However, the lead was erased when 
the home side went on a quick 6-0 run. A layup by Ilg with 1:07 remaining cut the lead to one, but the Lumberjacks held their nerve at the line in the final minutes to seal the win. The loss dropped UCSD to 25-4 overall.
Senior guard Brittany Taylor and 
senior center Paige Peterson carried the Lumberjacks with 16 points each, pushing Humboldt to its second straight CCAA title game. Humboldt went on to win the CCAA tournament, pummeling Chico State with a score of 85-55. 
This was the third time the Tritons 
played the Lumberjacks this season; in their first two games the home team emerged victorious. Seeded No. 4 in the CCAA tournament, the Lumberjacks ended the Tritons’ perfect 14-0 start to the season with an 84-80 victory on Jan. 21. However, when the teams met again at UCSD on Feb. 26, the Tritons came out on top with a 86-51 blowout victory.
UCSD is now 3-3 all-time in the 
CCAA tournament, after being knocked out in the first round last year and losing in the title game to Chico the year before.
The Tritons await the selection 
committee’s announcement if the NCAA Division-II West Regional field. The team is hoping to receive the No. 1 seed, which would allow UCSD to host the first three rounds of the regional tournament.

The Tritons tallied 207 points, giving 
them a comfortable win over second-place Point Loma’s 157.5-point tally.
In the higher-profile invitationals 
coming up, Salerno said depth will be the key to success. 
“We’re going to try to get the

TRACK & FIELD  — After being rained out of a 
meet at UC Irvine last weekend, the Triton track-
and-field teams were extra prepared to host the San Diego City Collegiate Championships on Mar. 6.
Both the men’s and women’s squads posted a 
slew of victories and broke two school records on what was a wildly successful day for the Tritons.
“We were ready to go last week, and getting 
cancelled was tough, ” head coach Tony Salerno said. “We got some decent conditions today, and everyone did pretty well. ”
San Diego State, Cal State San Marcos, Point 
Loma Nazarene University and the University of San Diego all participated in the meet. USD fielded only a women’s team. 
“It’s a pretty familiar group — almost a friends-and-family meet, ” Salerno said. “It’s nice, early in the season, to have an intimate meet like this. ”
On the men’s side, sophomore Nick Howe 
and senior Casey Ryan led the way, breaking their own school records in the javelin and high jump, respectively. Howe broke his record by over five feet with a throw of 206’3, ” and Ryan, fresh off a season with the men’s basketball team, jumped 7’1” in his first meet of the year to set a new personal best and school record. Senior Fred Cook touched 179’ in the hammer throw, easily winning the event and posting a Division-II national qualifying mark.
The men finished in first place with 156 
points, and Point Loma came in second with 133 points.
The Triton women were led by a trio of 
seniors who recorded national qualifying marks. Christine Merrill smashed the 400-meter hurdle competition in 59.82 seconds, won the 100-meter hurdles and ran on both the 4x100 and 4x400 relay teams. Leah Murphy won the triple jump LUMBERJACK REVENGE

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — UCSD had 
every right to be confident coming into a Mar. 5 encounter with Humboldt State. The women were seeded No. 1 in the tour-nament, and had beaten Humboldt mere days before.
However, the vengeful Lumberjacks 
took their shot at redemption — shoot-ing with the confidence of a conference champion — and upset the Tritons 82-78, knocking them straight out of the CCAA tournament.
Five Lumberjack players scored double 
figures, and the team hit eight threes in the second half, powering Humboldt to an upset victory.
Senior guard Annette Ilg led the Tritons 
with 21 points and sophomore guard Chelsea Carlisle added 15 points, but their performances couldn’t offset a night of stellar shooting from the Lumberjacks, who redeemed themselves from a dreadful loss to UCSD only a week before: The Tritons won by 35 points on home court.

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — Coming off a week 
of mixed results, the UCSD men’s volleyball team traveled north on March 5 to compete in a grueling battle against one of the most well-rounded teams in the conference: No. 2 Stanford University. Unfortunately for UCSD, Stanford bettered the Tritons in three of four 
matches, with a final count of 30-18, 30-20, 
28-30, 30-20.
The loss dropped the Triton record to 
5-13 overall, 2-11 in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play.
At the beginning of the match, Stanford 
quickly grabbed the lead, leaving UCSD to battle its way back. Against such a sturdy opponent, the challenge was too great for the Tritons.
Stanford started the first set by scoring 
five of the initial seven points. Though the Tritons took the lead after scoring eight of the next 10 points — senior opposite hitter Frank Fritsch’s kill marking the last Triton point — 
the Cardinal fought back to take the set 30-18.
The Cardinal carried on in winning form, 
easily winning the second set 30-20 and taking an early lead of 8-3 in the third.
“We got off to a poor start, ” head coach 
Kevin Ring said. “We played well in game one, 
but Stanford kept getting great plays, so we fell behind. We knew we had to get off to a better, consistent start to win. ”
However, UCSD pushed to make amends, 
tying the set 17-17 on a kill from junior middle-blocker Calvin Ross. Both teams were neck-and-neck until freshman middle-blocker Cyrus Kiani’s kill won the set 30-28 for UCSD.
