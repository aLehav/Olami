Repu blican gubernatoria l
candidate, Dou g Ose, stopped
by the UCSD Guardian office
last week for an interview.
Former Sacramento Congressman 
Dou g Ose is returnin g to po litics a fter
over a decade, throwin g his hat in 
the rin g for governor o f California.
He‚Äôs runnin g on t he Repu blican tic ket, 
and announce d his can didacy about a
week ago. 
Ose graduated from UC Ber keley in
1977, an d shortly after, starte d his own 
business in rea l estate development 
and investment. A fter 20 years 
in business , he ran for a seat in t he 
House o f Representatives in 1997. He 
served three consecut ive terms before
steppin g down in 2005 .
On Mon day Feb. 12 Ose came in 
to the UCS D Guardian‚Äôs o ffice for an 
interview. We asked  him about  what 
he hopes to deliver an d how he wou ld
oversee t he UC s ystem as governor.
‚ÄúIt just seems like common sense, 
you know?‚Äù Ose sai d about issues like
water, homelessness, and the econom y.
‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we just get someone to fix this
stuff? Can‚Äôt we have someone buckle
down an d get it fixed before t hey rush
off to the next ‚Äòissue of the da y?‚Äô That‚Äôs 
why I‚Äôm runnin g.‚Äù
The Guardian as ked him a bout 
his sponsorin g of President Donald 
Trump durin g the 2016 election. He 
had supported him a fter Je b Bus h
dropped out o f the race.
‚ÄúI was a stron g supporter o f 
Trump, ‚Äù Ose stated. ‚ÄúI si gned on in
February of 2016, an d I did it for a
very speci fic reason. An d that was:
From m y experience, which is different
than probabl y most of your readers,
but from m y experience, Was hington
is broken. We cou ld argue a bout t he 
merits o f the president‚Äôs tweets an d 
his language an d what have you, but
he certainl y is not same-old, same-old 
that we‚Äôve had for the last 25 years.‚Äù
He said that as a Re publican, he 
didn‚Äôt feel he had to chan ge anything
about his political character un der the
Trump presi dency.
Durin g the discussion t he UC
system, Ose was as ked about t he UC
Board of Re gents considerin g raisin g 
tuition a gain in t he sprin g after failing 
to receive the amount of fundin g 
for the UC s ystem in the 2018-19 
California budget that they desire d.
This was his stance:
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe colle ge should be
free. I think if you give somethin g 
away, it undermines its intrinsic value, ‚Äù
Ose told the Guardian. ‚ÄúIf ever y young 
person who is a freshman in hi gh 
school knew that the y could get into
any colle ge for free, the y receive the 
message that they don‚Äôt have to wor k 
very hard to get into co llege.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm m ore concerned about  
is gettin g awa y from a merit- based
admissions polic y into somethin gRECREATION

told the Student Sustainabilit y Collective 
last week that it is currentl y not able to move 
forward with its on going efforts to ban the sale o f 
non-reusable plastic water bottles on cam pus due
to a bevera ge contract with Coca-Cola that HDH
entere d in ear ly 2017. Bot h HDH an d SSC inten d to
work together to find a so lution t hat is favora ble to
both parties but does not vio late t he contract.   
The plastic water bottle ban campai gn is t he
result of a decade of stu dent a dvocac y wit h the 
SSC, beginnin g its campai gn on t he ban on sin gle-
use p lastic water bottles w hen t he organization
was esta blished in 2008. A.S. Counci l also passed
a referen dum in 2016 in support o f restrictin g the
sale of plastic water bottles on campus and reducin g 
plastic waste. 
‚ÄúBy participatin g in a culture of reusable water
bottle and h ydration station usa ge ‚Ä¶ UCSD students,
staff, and faculty can re duce ne gative environmenta l
impacts in a manner t hat is a lso cost e ffective, ‚Äù
former A.S. Vice Presi dent o f Environmenta l Justice
Affairs Moon Pan kam to ld the UCS D Guardian at
the time of the referendum.
‚ÄúIn 2012, we had an a greement with HDH that
established a ban on sing le-use p lastic water bottles,
but it wasn‚Äôt we ll-defined, ‚Äù SSC‚Äôs Director o f Water
and Plastic Water Bott le Ban Campai gn Lea der ZoeSebri ght said. ‚ÄúThey sell above 16.9 ounces in the 
dining halls still. This year we wante d to revamp our
agreement wit h HDH to exten d it to up to one gallon
so it inc ludes all water bottles.‚Äù
SSC re-presente d the ban to t he HDH a dvisor y 
committee in a meetin g last wee k but were to ld that
it could not pro gress with the proposal due to the 
contract.
‚Äú[The HDH advisor y committee members] said
that their aim is to tr y and reduce t he use o f single-
use plastic water bottles, but the y‚Äôre workin g within 
the limitations wit hin these contracts t hey have, ‚Äù
Sebright said. 
UCSD‚Äôs seven- year contract wit h Coca-Co la went 
into e ffect on Jan 1, 2017. T he agreement out lines
legal requirements for the sa le of the compan y‚Äôs
products, an d in turn, Coca-Co la wi ll provide
$585,000 eac h year to UCSD durin g the time o f the
seven- year con tract.
Certain restrictive con ditions in t he agreement 
prevent t he campai gn from movin g forwar d.
In addition to the s ponsorshi p fees, ‚Äú[Coca -

SSC conducted a student surve y

bottle use. Out of 1,089 responses,51.8 percent said that they do not buy single-use plastic water bottles and 95
percent of 981 student res ponses said 
that they use a reusa ble water bottle.
Furt hermore, w hen given t he

52.7 percent of 1,089 chose five,24.7 percent chose four, 15.2 percent

‚Äú At the end of the day, we are 
using stu dent funding, an d we want
to give back to stu dents an d ma ke
sure t hat we have t heir priorities in 
mind,‚Äù  S ebright said. 
However, Se bright suspects t hat 
some students ma y not be in favor
of the ban because it is ‚Äúlimitin g that
choice‚Äù between a sin gle-use water
bottle and a reusable one, which ma y 
b e  v i e w e d  a s  ‚Äú a n  a t t a c k  o n  people‚Äôs
liberties. ‚Äù 
Roger Reve lle Co llege sop homore
Stephanie Pine da proposed a different
approac h for the plastic water bottle
ban.
‚ÄúI believe that HDH should
minimize [its] sell of plastic water
bottles and focus more on sellin g
better alternatives, ‚Äù Pineda told theGuardian. ‚ÄúI feel like the more 
[it
displays] plastic water bottles in a
freezer , the more inc lined stu dents
are to buy t hem; t herefore, i f HDHwou ld limit t hat, stu dents wou ld 
have to look into the investment of a
reusab le water bottle and start a chain
reaction.‚Äù 
However, Sebright suggested that
the plastic water bottle ban would
help to limit cam pus waste. 
‚ÄúWe say we stand for sustainability 
and we have a ll these different 
policies, an d we sa y we‚Äôre going to do 
Zero Waste, but rea lly the biggest part
of reducin g your waste is to reduce
your consumption first. ‚Äù
The goal in ‚Äúzero waste‚Äù is to
reduce the amount of waste sent
to a landfill. In the ‚Äúidea of waste 
hierarc hy: re fuse, re duce, reuse,
recyc le‚Äù, Se bright suggests t hat 
‚Äúrecycle should be our last alternative. ‚Äù
HDH was not a ble to provi de

When UC San Diego pledged to become
carbon neutral b y 2025, facult y wasted no time
in putting these claims to action. The schoolis currentl
y on track to have 30 percent of 
campus-provided food comin g from sustainable
sources b y 2020 and is workin g to move its
vehicles to renewable ener gy. However, UCSD
LV RYHUORRNLQ JD V LJQL√ÄFDQW FRQWULEXWRU WR LWV
carbon footprint: meat. Knowin g that the mea t 
industr y makes u p approximatel y 40 percent of 
global a gricultural product in the U.S. and has
a largel y negative environmental impact, pulling 
back on the amount of meat products servedon campus wi
ll serve as a vita l area on which
the school will need to focus its goals. UCSD
needs to shift its on-campus food selection to
have more more plant-based, environmentall y
friendl y options while adding sustainabilit y
workshops and programs to steer the universit y
in a m ore sustainable directi on.
The meat industr y has quite a large stake
in environmental harm. Animal agriculture
accounts for between 14 and 18 percent of global
greenhouse gas emissions, with beef releasing
four times the emissions of a caloric-equivalen t 
RISRUNDQG√ÄYHWLPHVWKDWRISRX OWU\,QIDFW
the am ount of carb on di oxide released fr om
producing one pound of beef is even greate r 
than that of burning a gallon of gasoline. Plant-based foods on the other hand produce three to√ÄYHWLPHVOHVVHPLVVLRQVLQWKH

production compared to mass equivalents of 
meat products. These numbers foretell that plant-based diets will have to be at the forefront of our 
WKLQNLQJIRUDVXVWDLQDEOH SODWH√ÄOOLQ JIXWXUH
Yet reasonabl y and ex pectedl y, not man y
people are read y to give u p meat. The Wall Stree t Journal recentl y released an article discussing
how the U.S. beef-cattle herd has increased b y 
12 percent in the past four years, and in 2017
a record 99.7 billion pounds of red meat and 
poultr y were produced. Companies such as 
7\VRQ)RRGV,QFDUHHYHQ SODQQLQJRQSXVKLQJ
meat production to increase b y 3.8 percent in
2018 through the construction of new plants 
and slaughterhouses. Evidentl y, consumption, 
and therefore production, of meat is steadil y 
increasin g.
Yet reducin g UCSD‚Äôs carbon foot print 
does not necessaril y mean giving up meat, but 
simply cuttin g down on individual consum ption. 
While UCSD moves toward more sustainable 
food offerin gs on cam pus, the o pportunit y-in-
hidin g directl y relates to educatin g students

RQ WKH EHQH√ÄWV RI SODQWEDVHG HDWLQJ DQG WR
reinforce hea lthy and sustainab le diets for 
students‚Äô futures. After all, the demand for plant-
based diets is growing; according to a recent 
study, the number of U.S. individuals identif ying 
as vegan has increased from one percent to six 
percent from 2014 to 2017. B y offering more 
plant-based options and educating on plant-
based diets, students would be encouraged to 
eat more sustainable food while decreasing meat 
consumption, thus pushing UCSD forward in its 
sustainabilit y goals.
Current resources students have to reduce 
their carbon footprints include guides fo r 
vegetarian and vegan dining, shopping lists 
for affordable organic foods, and links fo r 
various information on sustainable eating. But DWWHPSWLQJS ODQWEDVHGGLHWVIRUWKH√ÄUVWWLPH

Whether it be a traveling ‚Äúfreak show‚Äù
from the mid-1800s or a presidential
campaign run b y a realit y-TV star in 
2016, Americans have alwa ys prioritized 
the most e ye-catchin g content, no matte r 
KRZVHQVDWLRQD O,QRUGHUWRFDSLWD OL]HRQ
this, ma jor media news outlets interview 
individuals who represent a niche secto r 
of the sociopolitical spectrum that 
generall y harbor bi goted ideolo gies. As a
result, mainstream media as a whole has
become a mechanism for gainin g more 
views at the risk of propagating harmful 
ideas. Mainstream media should no t 
call f or a rem oval of either c onservative 
or liberal voices, but it cannot give a 
platform to those whose o pinions work
to disenfranchise individuals based on
characteristics be yond their control. 
Rather, news outlets must recognize that b
y giving a platform to bigoted ideologies, 
more harm is committed than good .
This happened with Vice Media, a left 
leanin g news media com pany. Less than 
a week after protests turned violent last 
August in Charlottesville, V A, Vice put 
out ‚ÄúCharlottesville: Race and Terror.‚ÄùThe documentar y centered around Elle 
Reeve as she followed neo-Nazis during 
the event. While its intenti on was t o
expose these people as fostering hate 
and divisiveness, the manner in which
the piece was created did the opposite. 
This piece not onl y introduced neo-Nazis 
to a national platform, but essentiall y 
humanized their ideolo gy by puttin g faces 
to hate speech.  
Vice is not the onl y media compan y
guilt y of giving a platform to hate groups .From ABC to MSNBC, it is hard to tune into a news broadcast without seeing an interview with someone holding harmful
social views. When NBC allowed Me gyn 
Kelly, a conservative talk show host,
to interview blatant cons piracy theoris t 
Alex Jones, the y were telling millions
of marginalized people that gaining a
high number of views is more important 
than refusing to normalize his brand of 
fearmon gering. Media outlets abound 
with examples like these that cater to a
portion of the population who believe tha t 
freedom of speech mandates that media
companies give a voice to an y and all,
regardless of how malicious their views
are.
These instances are s ymptoms of a 
larger disease, one spread b y a number of 
spurious ar guments. Pro ponents of a ‚Äúfree 
market of ideas‚Äù argue that, if you don‚Äôt 
like what you‚Äôre seeing on TV , you can 
just turn it off. Unfortunatel y, it is not that 
easy. While this ma y be a viable solution

Political c ommentat ors threaten

the opposite is true. B y not giving

An even more common argument 
against refusing to validate harmful

that this an infringement of the First 
Amendment. We must remembe r 
that free speech is technicall y only
guaranteed b y the government.
Freedom of speech is a right that does not mandate that others give

standard practice for media outlets;

is and isn‚Äôt newsworth y to the
general public. What criteria media

may vary, but conscientiousness is
an inherent responsibilit y for ever y
news compan y.  
But, as some neoconservative 
proponents would argue, there is a
need for a diverse range of opinions 
from all corners of the political
spectrum to be heard. While true,
there is a difference between having
a diverse range of opinions and

The United States is grounded
in the principle that ever yone is

if we are going to pride ourselveson this facet, then we must not 
allow opinions that take awa y this
fundamental freedom from an yone.

Startin g anew in colle ge is difficult enou gh for most

resources speci fically caterin g to stu dent veterans at UC San

Resource Center (SVRC), but seemin gly, they aren‚Äôt enou gh.
The Guardian sat down with John Muir Colle ge junior 
Buyanneme kh Tso gtbaator (w ho goes by Neme kh), to discuss
his recent ordeal at the V A Hos pital. Nemekh, a transfer student,
descri bed the sur geries for his
torn pectoral muscle in jury ‚Äî
a pain fully protracte d process 
that has dragged on from Ma y 
to Decem ber, an d even t hen 
remains unreso lved.
‚ÄúEven thou gh I have UC
[Stu dent Hea lth Insurance
Plan], I fi gured I‚Äô d go to the
VA  because I don‚Äôt have to
pay the co-pay. It took about
a mont h to actua lly see t hem,
almost a mont h, three wee ks, ‚Äù
said N emekh.  W hen the
surgery was finally performe d 
in late June, Neme kh was in 
a sling for ei ght wee ks, an d
then durin g physical therap y,
ever ything was healing well. However, he had to return to t he
hospital after t he area had become in fected.
‚ÄúI started to experience a lot of pain, ti ghtness, and swellin g
around the area, ‚Äù Nemekh explained. ‚ÄúEventuall y, the swellin g 
got to t he point w here t he tissue aroun d the sur gery site got so ft
and then busted open. ‚Äù
After initia lly denying that this was an in fection at a ll, the
surgeon an d physician assistant went further to dispute t he
possibility that Neme kh had cau ght the in fection from t hehospital itself, and actuall y blamed Nemekh for causin g it.
‚ÄúThey told me, it‚Äôs one of those thin gs where [I] irritated
[my] shoulder throu gh the ph ysical therap y or I actuall y lifted
weights. T hat‚Äôs w hat they told me, ‚Äù sai d Neme kh incre dulously.
‚ÄúAnd I hadn‚Äôt lifted an y weights b y then! ‚Äù
This blame was further insinuate d when the hospital told him 
to let it close on its own b y not usin g his left arm or shoulder.
‚ÄúAnd I didn‚Äôt. It didn‚Äôt go awa y. I came back a week and a hal f 
later. ‚Äù
Neme kh was prescri bed
antibiotics. When that did not
work, he was given a stron ger 
one, which was ine ffective 
yet again. T he whole time, he
had only seen t he PA, an d the
urgeon hadn‚Äôt even done a
proper p hysical evaluation.
‚ÄúHe just looked at it and 
aid, ‚ÄòOK. Tr y these antibiotics.
See where it gets you, ‚Äô‚Äù said
Nemekh. ‚ÄúFor me , I didn‚Äôt
ike that. How can you just
hrow a bunch of antibiotics 
at me, t hinking that it wi ll just
go awa y on its own?‚Äù A fter
almost a mont h of constant ly 
comin g back to t he hospita l
and arguing with the doctor a bout t he nature o f the infection, he
insiste d on gettin g a cu lture done, but even t hat hadn‚Äôt helped.
‚ÄúNo improvements. I got this bi g gapin g hole in m y shoulder
now, ‚Äù sai d Neme kh. After waitin g for three wee ks for lab resu lts, 
the hospita l still did not know t he cause, an d suggested anot her
surgery to figure it out. At t hat point, it was Novem ber, an d right
in the middle  of Week 8 midterms. This made the decision evenThe Guardian speaks with Buyannemekh Tsogtbaator, a student veteran who received disappointing healthcare at the VA Hospital over a dragged-out period of six months and three surgeries.

being even more s kewed than usua l for stu dent veterans. So he
decided to hold off. ‚ÄúFinals [were] comin g up. I would have to
drop a ll my classes an d pay the V A back the mone y I receive d 
for m y school benefits. ‚Äù
Eventuall y, Nemekh decided to take another route and see
someone from Student Health Services (SHS ). The doctor
and nurse practitioner were imme diately helpful and figured
out the cause  of the infection to be due to some anaerobic
bacteria. Un fortunate ly, the anti biotics t hey prescri bed were
a disappointment once a gain, and the V A kept insistin g on 
surgery. Then, Nemekh tried, with the help of the doctor at
SHS, to get an appointment t hrough UC SHIP at UCSD‚Äôs
orthopedic department, but a fter en dless postponing an d 
excuses on t heir part, even t hat trac k did not wor k.
‚ÄúThey kept sa ying, ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt want to take responsibilit y 
for your current condition because initial sur gery was done
by the V A, ‚Äô‚Äù explained Nemekh. ‚ÄúI was kinda taken aback b y 
it because I have health insurance wit h UC SHIP . I s hould at
least be able to get an appointment wit h ortho an d get their
opinion on w hat‚Äôs happenin g with my health.‚Äù
At the end of Novem ber, wit h an o pen woun d that was sti ll

that quarter. ‚ÄúI had to miss two finals, but m y physiolo gy 
and political science professors were super cool about it andwor
ked it out wit h me.‚Äù
But even t hen, s hockingly, the ordeal was not over. A fter 
waking up from anest hesia, t he doctors ne glected to give
Neme kh any follow-up instructions, an d performe d a shabby 
follow-u p proce dure a wee k later. Two wee ks later, Neme kh
found a suture pokin g out of his wound .
‚ÄúI was like, ‚ÄòWhat the hell? Wh y is it left there?‚Äô‚Äù related 
Nemekh. ‚ÄúThe next da y, I [saw another] one stickin g out. I 
was like, ‚Äòwhat?‚Äô so I tried to pull it out. I couldn‚Äôt pull it out
because it was sna gging on somet hing in there.‚Äù
As the wee k pro gresse d, he starte d noticin g multiple areas
where non-dissolvable sutures had just been left in there.
Unsurprisin gly, the VA Hospita l brushed it o ff, telling him, 
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know [the reason]. As lon g as it‚Äôs not causin g any

he is sti ll in to day, after a lmost t hree drawn-out sur geries, wit h
a wound that is still not perfectl y healed .
‚ÄúMy biggest gripe with V A would be how the y handled the
infection a fter t he sur gery. Incompetence on t heir PA ‚Äôs part
and instructions I‚Äôve gotten from m y surgeon, ‚Äù sai d Neme kh.
The stress t hat this situation placed on Neme kh, one t hat
was easi ly six mont hs long, is un fair on t he part o f UCSD‚Äôs
orthopedic department and especiall y the V A. Bein g pre -
med at UCSD is an especia lly difficult pat h, consi dering the
competition an d top grades it requires, an d to deal with so
muc h pain an d difficulty while taking upper- division exams
at the same time was no eas y feat.
‚ÄúIt reall y set me back academicall y because I could have 
been usin g that time to stu dy for m y classes or doing somet hing
other than sittin g at the V A for an hour or two to been seen
for m y appointment. ‚Äù An d even t hen, t he appointments
were never ta ken at t he scheduled time , and neit her was t he
responsibilit y for the dela y. ‚ÄúTheir response was, ‚ÄòWe have a
lot of patients. ‚Äô Well, OK, ‚Äù said Nemekh sarcasticall y. ‚ÄúI guess Idon‚Äôt have an ything better to do than this.‚Äù
Along with the coup le of health care pro fessiona ls that did
try to help him, Neme kh also cre dits t he Stu dent Veterans 
Resource Center at UCSD (SVRC ). When he had to ma ke 
the difficult decision of takin g a quarter off to deal with 
the in jury, the coordinator at SVRC advised him to sta y in 
my classes, a decision he is grateful for bein g encoura ged to
take. ‚Äú[In the end], I had actuall y had gotten throu gh all m y 
classes an d too k all my finals an d everyt hing wor ked out. ‚Äù
The coor dinator, however, was not comp letely surprise d by 
Nemekh‚Äôs experiences .
‚ÄúShe [had] heard the horror stories; it‚Äôs not a secret for the 
VA to do stu ff like this,‚Äù Neme kh told the UCSD Guar dian.
One o f his friends had gotten an MRSA in fection a fter
surgery for her foot at t he V A, due to a bone in fection, an d had
to sta y two weeks on antibiotics after the sur gery. Nemekh also
met an elderl y gentleman who had a sur gery around the same
time an d had gotten an in fection t hat wasn‚Äôt reso lved unti l
three months after June. ‚ÄúHe actuall y ended up gettin g sepsis,
full on sepsis, an d had to sta y in ICU, ‚Äù sai d Neme kh.
Still, he cre dits UCSD for the help he got from t he SVRC 
while trans ferrin g, and the other stu dent veterans he met t here
and formed stud y groups with.
‚ÄúY eah, it was a bi g chan ge. Academicall y, it was challen ging
in the beginnin g. But we‚Äôre use d to committin g time into
things we want to do, being a veteran. Wor king hard is not a 
problem. In t he beginnin g, it was hard to actua lly know w hich
resources are available to you, especiall y like tutorin g centers,
office hours, discussion sections, an d things like that.‚Äù
Nemekh‚Äôs ‚Äòwork-hard‚Äô mindset certainl y derives from his
trainin g from being in t he Marines, but so does his desire
to be a docto r. ‚ÄúI was a combat medic. I w orked with a lot
of physicians an d physician assistants an d I saw how muc h
a difference the y were makin g ever y single da y. I wanted to 
make that difference too ,‚Äù declared Nemekh. ‚ÄúI feel that‚Äôs one
of the unique t hings I‚Äôve seen t hat I want to help those peop le
that are in n eed. ‚Äù
This admira ble goal that Neme kh has, an d the aspirations
of all other stu dent veterans at UCSD, s hould be encoura ged.
With the graduation rates of student veterans alread y lower 
on avera ge than civi lian stu dents, it is c lear t hat adjustin g
and dealing wit h college life after years awa y from forma l
education is extreme ly challenging, an d they should get t he
full benefits o f the resources promise d. The V A ‚Äôs behavior
disappointed Nemekh, because the priorit y should be to help
a patient, not to be so scare d of the conse quences an d not 
even try.
‚ÄúFor some reason, the V A was ver y hesitant on culturin g 
what I had. I a lmost felt like [they didn‚Äôt want to ta ke the
blame for the infection], so I didn‚Äôt like that. I mean, w hat‚Äôs
the point of havin g UC SHIP if you can‚Äôt get your needs met,
right?‚Äù sai d Neme kh.
Neme kh hopes that UCSD wi ll increase its awareness o f 
these pro blems an d try to focus on improvin g the pro blems.
‚ÄúI almost felt like UCSD didn‚Äôt want to take an y part of it.
They maybe felt that I cou ld potentia lly sue t hem in t he long
run i f somet hing goes wron g. They were basica lly trying to
stay clear of it so that the y don‚Äôt have to have responsibilit y.‚Äù‚ñ∂STUDENT VETERAN S,from pa ge 6

Afilm that spea ks socia lly, narrative ly, and visua lly.
Asuper hero film ou ght to ma ke us
feel incre dible. Though it should also 
tug at our heartstrin gs an d leave us 
dreadin g disaster, it is not meant to be a pure 
social commentar y. Some ma y want ‚ÄúBlac k 
Pant her‚Äù to have a more si gnificant messa ge
about current politics t han w hat it o ffers (or
not have one at a ll), but these are excessive
expectations o f a film that simp ly aims to
be entertainin g. ‚ÄúBlack Panther‚Äù succeeds at
that: It‚Äôs light on its commentar y, con fident
in its performance, and is probabl y the first 
spectacu lar action movie o f the year.
Comic book fans, re joice; ‚ÄúBlack Panther‚Äù
introduces its titular hero on familiar ground
while bringing uninitiate d au diences up
to spee d. Eons a go, a Vi branium-im bued
meteorite crash landed in Africa. Five warrin g
tribes com peted for t he meta l unti l one
warrior consume d a flower, touc hed by its
properties. He gaine d super human a bilities
and became t he first B lack Pant her, ru ler o f 
the five tribes and new nation of Wakanda.
Under his ru le, this kingdom t hrived as a
technological marve l centuries a head of its
time, but its peop le feare d that the outsi de
world wou ld sac k its resources an d wea lth.
Wakanda retreate d into iso lation, posin g asa simp le indepen dent a gricultural state w hile 
neither acceptin g nor offerin g international 
aid. (Notice an y modern para llels?)
Following the events of ‚ÄúCivil War, ‚Äù
the mant le of the Black Pant her passed to 
King T‚ÄôC halla (C hadwick Boseman), w ho 
still grieves his father‚Äôs death. Boseman is 
impressive as a so lemn, dutiful monarc h. He is
stron gly loyal to his father an d to his countr y‚Äôs
traditions, wishin g to uphold their principles
and to preserve Wa kanda‚Äôs wa y of life.  Lea ding 
a countr y is difficult, however, no matter w hat
virtues or superhuman stren gth T‚ÄôChalla has.
Defending the throne from c hallengers in
brutal ritual combat is no easier than keepin g
personal promises to friends and famil y. At 
times, he ma kes conse quentia l decisions, both
great an d sma ll, that dictate t he future o f 
Wakanda. Boseman‚Äôs dedication to t he part,
comp lete wit h a genuine A frican accent, is
laudab le.
Fortunate ly, he is backed by an equa lly 
stron g fema le cast, inc luding his p layful
prodigy sister S huri (Letita Wri ght) an d his
lovin g ex- girlfriend Nakia (Lupita N yong‚Äô o).
They provi de him wit h the gadgets, t he
musc le, an d the emotiona l support t hat he
needs. Eac h actress brings her own power fulattitu de to t he table, on par wit h Boseman‚Äô s
cool demeanor. Shuri esta blishes herself as 
the Black Pant her‚Äôs Q, tro lling her brother
with a kinetica lly-charged supersuit t hat
sends attac kers spraw ling. In anot her,
Genera l Okoye (Danai Gurira) swears her
fealt y to the throne of Wakanda, ‚ÄúNo matter
who sits u pon it. ‚Äù The Panther‚Äôs heroic
entoura ge must be oppose d by menacin g
villains, an d Ulysses K laue (An dy Ser kis)
and Erik Killmon ger (Michael B. Jordan)
answer fierce ly. Ser kis‚Äô dangerous ly jovia l air 
is hilarious, but Jor dan is perhaps Marve l‚Äôs
most complex and compellin g anta gonist yet. 
He vents his animosit y and frustration towar d
racia l oppression, his thoughts swir ling into a 
fanatica l, yet re latable, revo lutionar y ideology. 
The contemporary metap hor is stri king an d
speaks volumes for societ y toda y.
Spea king of po litics, it is a gain 
unreaso nable to watch ‚ÄúBlack P anther‚Äù
through a pure ly partisan lens. It is, at its core,
a touc hing messa ge about communa l unit y 
and collaboration. This film has premiered 
at a time w hen re fugees, statesmen, blacks, 
whites, haves, an d have-nots are a ll uncertain 
of the future and sus picious of one another.
A com fortin g cue to come to gether an dsolve society‚Äôs ills is perhaps what is needed
now more t han ever. Sti ll, why shouldn‚Äôt we 
have a little ass- kicking and visua l spectac le 
on the side? From Wa kanda‚Äôs ma jestic an d
imaginative metropo litan s kyline to t he neon -
glow of Busan‚Äôs urban districts, there‚Äôs alwa ys
somet hing that catc hes attention. Braw ls
are jaw-droppin g too: W hen do beauti fully-
choreo graphed tussles, flippin g cars, and the 
breathtaking acro batics o f the Black Pant her
get old? Never.
‚ÄúBlack Panther‚Äù trium phs where previous 
solo-focuse d Marve l films have stum bled. It
touches human emotions more deeply than
others, w hile giving appropriate attention
to to day‚Äôs socia l climate. Suc h a narrative
says more than an y haphazard colla ge of 
computer- generate d ima ging and hamtastic
dialogue cou ld. Marve l and Disne y should pay 
close attention to t he enormous praise t hat
this film receives: It will serve their formula
for futu re titles well.

PHOTO COURTESY OF MARVEL STUDIOS
 PHOTO COURTESY OF MARVEL STUDIOS‚ÄúWhen We First Met‚Äù is about pit ying yet another guy who has been rele gated to the friend zone .
The new Netflix chick-flick , ‚ÄúWhen We
First Met, ‚Äù does not qua lify as a rom -
com because it barely contains t he
out-and-out romantic and comedic elements
of one. T he movie is dull, wit h a dearth of 
three-dimensiona l characters, funny writin g,
or even an endearin g, focal affair.  
After meetin g the stunnin g Aver y Martin
(Alexan dra Da ddario) at a Ha lloween part y,
Noah Ashb y (Adam DeVine) is hopelessl y 
smitten an d determine d to a lign his destin y 
with hers. But w hen t hey spen d the ni ght
together and end up at her home, he gets
undenia bly and unsurprisin gly friend-zone d.
Three years later, a smile y Aver y is betrothed
to anot her man , and a lovesic k Noa h is broken-
hearte d and inebriate d at Avery‚Äôs engagement
part y. Wit h impu lsive behavior, he revisits
the photo booth that the two had snappe d
pictures in t hree years a go. Ma gically and
miracu lously, the booth gifts him t he chance
to rewrite his fate wit h Aver y by transportin ghim to that notorious Halloween over and 
over a gain unti l he achieves his sore ly-sou ght
love.  
The film is a rippe d-off hybrid of 
‚ÄúGroundho g Da y‚Äù and ‚ÄúAbout Time‚Äù that 
mashes the time-trave l and romance genres, 
but it definite ly does not matc h the ca liber
of those movies‚Äô stor ytelling. It s hows Noa h 
trying different approaches to set his romantic
kismet in motion , but his different actions
create time ripp les, a lterin g variations o f his
life and character each time. From bein g
accuse d as a sta lker to becomin g a douchebag
to em bodying an a ffluent businessman, 
ever y time-and-space jump pulls him closer
to the girl of his dreams. Un fortunate ly, all
the skewere d time lines are uninspirin g as
the narrative overp lays the same formu laic 
shtick of Noa h redoing his prior actions. T he 
plotline rec ycles itself, becomin g predictable
and unamusin g to viewers. C liches are 
also re hashed, like Noa h being blindsided by Aver y‚Äôs existence an d ignorin g the more
compati ble love interest, Aver y‚Äôs friend, Carrie
(Shelley Henni g), an d the pe destrian lesson
that love cannot be forced.
But even t he platitu de of unre quited love
is overruled. After realizin g that Carrie is his 
ideal woman, Noa h imme diately abandons his
pursuit to bed Aver y and magnetizes towar d
the next attainable and available female. The
trope o f a man-c hild being rewar ded wit h
the instantaneous and serendi pitous love
of a girl after re jection is a possessive and
over done conce pt. It‚Äôs a lso poor c haracter
develo pment because Noah does not 
experience an y lingering or biting heartac he 
from his pro longe d, one-si ded infatuation. His 
character arc stifles, blockin g the emer gence 
of an intri guing stor y.
Some c haracters an d writin g also lack 
persona lity. However, A dam DeVine ma kes
up t he ma jority of the entertainment in an
otherwise comp letely monotonous come dy by usin g his usua l exu berance an d zaniness.
Shelley Henni g‚Äôs c hic-yet-ner dy portra yal
of Carrie is a lso c harmin g, heightenin g the
fraught dynamic between t he endgame coup le.
Both actors definite ly have mutua l, on-screen 
synergy an d comic banter; however, t he
screenp lay makes the mista ke of not handing
more limelight to t he simpatico pair .
‚ÄúWhen We First Met‚Äù is a repetitive and 
unexcitin g romantic-come dy, filled wit h a
corn y, time-travellin g gimmick that fla gs after 
the first act. T here are exceptions in w hich
certain characters have re partee, but their
pleasant performances aren‚Äôt nearl y enou gh
to save t he half-baked narrative. A las, the film
is forgettable an d me diocre wit h no zest ful
quality to warrant watc hing.

Like many young girls, I dreamed of my own wedding having luxurious decorations, a lavish 
venue, and a stunning white lace dress, with the man I so dearly love wearing a black suit waiting 
down the aisle for me. At playdates, my friends and I would have pretend weddings where we 
exchanged toy rings and where I played the bride, wearing a veil made up of paper towels and a 
plastic tiara. Like most people, I grew up wanting marriage as part of the next chapter of my life. However, as I grew older, this ‚Äúdream‚Äù slowly vanished as I matured and realized that marriage is, to me, a socially-constructed idea. I imagine most people want to get married as a way to receive 
an official title, and that they believe marriages are associated with the idea of true love. But is 
marriage the only way to have true love? My parents have been happily married for over 25 years, and some of my cousins and close friends are now engaged to their significant others. With so many successful and loving relationships surrounding me, I wonder how I detached myself from the idea of marriage and view it as an overrated and expensive concept.
My disbelief surrounding marriages began around middle school. I overheard a conversation 
my teacher had with her friend‚Äôs daughter about the amount of stress she had when planning her wedding. The bride was not handling the wedding planning well, especially with the lack of her fiance‚Äôs physical and financial assistance. Furthermore, I learned about the legal troubles and 
high costs that are required for a divorce when a family friend went through the process. These 
conversations were very intriguing and got me to think about the true importance of marriage. Besides having financial benefits such as paying less income taxes or having more health insurance options, what does marriage actually bring me? For me, marriage is a ceremony hosted by a couple to celebrate receiving a piece of paper with their loved one while spending an extravagant amount 
of money. Simply put, marriage could be an emotional agreement between two people who need a 
confirmation of their love for one another. 
If I truly love someone, I do not need a piece of paper titled ‚ÄúMarriage Certificate‚Äù to prove as 
much. I do not need to take another person‚Äôs name to tell others that I love this person. I do not 
need to be married in order to live together, go on dates, and build a family to live as a ‚Äúmarried‚Äù 
couple. I do not need to say ‚ÄúI do‚Äù in order to stay committed to one person. Ultimately, to have a blissful relationship together, a legal agreement should not be required as long as there is a mutual connection between the two people. Arguably, marriage could be a way to conform to society‚Äôs thinking of what is considered a family.
I am not anti-marriage; I do not hate marriages nor do I dread attending the weddings of others. 
In fact, I feel happy and sincerely congratulate couples during their wedding ceremonies. I, however, just cannot see myself holding a wedding in the near future with my significant other. Maybe my outlook and viewpoint will change within the next several years as I gain more experiences. But 
with all the current stressful planning and financial burden involved in receiving a piece of paper, 
I am proud to say I am more afraid of getting married than staying single for the rest of my life. Written by Rebecca Tsang // Lifestyle Contributing Writer Is Marriage Necessary?Time and people may change, but space can give the most ephemeral of fugitives a place to 
settle, even if for a bit. Falling in love doesn‚Äôt have to look like a typical boy-meets-girl narrative; sometimes it can take the shape of girl-meets-city. 
From 1996 to 2014, the mid-sized town of Bakersfield was all I knew. I could recognize the 
mountains edging the 99 Freeway even in the densest of valley fogs or the curves of the Kern River, even when the summer drought took its hardest toll. And I could mentally map out the vintage stores, old theaters, renovated tattoo shops, and homestyle diners that dotted my gridlock 
downtown. Say what you want about the Central Valley ‚Äî and more likely than not, I‚Äô d agree ‚Äî but 
for 18 years, this little city was my home and heart.
Come September 2014, a few clouds hovering over the Pacific began to reestablish my home 
and heart. In the sunshine that lingers into the middle of February and sand that would always be 
there if I needed it, it became easier to leave what I knew existed only four hours away. San Diego 
might be a tourist destination for some, but I was determined to make it my own for the four years 
it promised me.
Though, temptations can come too. For a week, Portland beckoned me away from the sun with 
its rain. It was inviting ‚Äî hospitable through every cup of coffee and whimsical in every quirk 
of its residents, books, trees and transit lines. Temptations also come with lessons. A trip to San Francisco reminded me why I loved San Diego instead. In the hurriedness and innovation of the 
North California skyline, I learned to be grateful for the slowness San Diego offered. 
But halfway through San Diego‚Äôs promised four years, I learned to love another city. 102 miles of 
freeway were daunting at first, but like anything else, the more it‚Äôs travelled, the more comfortable it gets. Two hours north ‚Äî on a good traffic day ‚Äî sits Los Angeles in a halo of smog and veganism. LA ‚Äôs a paradox in every way, with characters and stories that don‚Äôt go together crowded into different neighborhoods and parks, museums, and cafes. It‚Äôs for artists and creators, movers 
and leaders, and in my slow, San Diego, student lifestyle, I wasn‚Äôt necessarily any of those things. 
But a summer spent in this city taught me how the unconventional comes together, how there is 
brokenness and beauty etched into every sidewalk, and how even if I wasn‚Äôt typically LA in any way, there could be home for me there too.
All that to say, a lot of things happen in our college years. We grow, we fall, we learn, we change. 
But the cities we take from and give to can stay constant in the volatile, temporary nature of our twenties. In this modern love of ours, we‚Äôre conditioned to love what is temporary, so perhaps the spaces around us know how to hold our hearts best. As we learn to better love others and ourselves, may we look to the spaces around us for a bit of reassurance that though things come and go, there 
are places we can call home, even if for a little while. Written by Brittney Lu // Lifestyle Associate Editor To My Cities, With Love THE UCSD GUARDIAN | TUESDAY , FEBRUARY 20, 2018 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.OR G 
When most people think of modern love, what do the y ima gine? Surel y tales of unlikel y 
romance come to min d, where peop le find love in spite o f certain o bstacles life throws t heir way.
Well, my definition is a bit different. At m y current sta ge in life, there are zero dating prospects
present, but that‚Äôs been t he case for the past 19 years. As someone w ho was s hy when it came to both
dating and friendships, I a lways had a re lative ly sma ll num ber of peop le that I depen ded on w hile
growin g up. Because of m y lack of romantic ties, I have come to appreciate the simple pleasure o f 
having a se lect group o f friends I feel close to. 
When it comes to m y experience wit h friendship in co llege, I found that there was a wor ld of 
difference compare d to ear lier years. For instance, somet hing about living with my friends brought
us closer to gether ver y quickl y. Before startin g my freshman year, I found m y two roommates
throu gh Facebook, both as ea ger as I was to locate potential roommates. Flash forward to our first
meetin g in Septem ber, an d our friendship began to blossom. Havin g already exchanged messa ges
and Snapc hats throughout t he summer, we were a ble to s kirt aroun d the aw kward phase o f being
total stran gers w ho lived together in one room. I remem ber visitin g Roger‚Äôs Mar ket for the first
time, sittin g outside as we talked extensivel y about basketball anime, and still bein g awake in the
later hours talkin g about young adult books while lau ghing way too loud to be compl ying with quiet
hours. In my suite, I forme d my core group o f friends who I re lied on a lmost entire ly, an d I loved it.
Bein g friends wit h the peop le I lived with brought me muc h more joy than I cou ld have anticipate d.
However, t his honeymoon p hase was not ever ything I ma de it out to be. Severa l of my 
suitemates w hom I was c lose wit h were muc h more extroverte d than me, joinin g multiple clubs and
organizations to fill their time. Soon enou gh, the y made plent y of their own friends who the y spent 
time wit h, leaving less time for our group in t he suite to a ll hang out toget her. I watc hed my one
roommate start going to Geise l with her friends, an d as she came back late every nig ht, less o f her
free time was left open. Anot her suitemate became so busy with her clubs that she barely even s lept
at our p lace. T hough such a level of busyness felt norma l for them, I cou ldn‚Äôt matc h such a lifestyle.
I wanted to be gin colle ge at m y own pace, and I wasn‚Äôt read y to commit to an y club durin g my first
year. Un fortunate ly, that had some uninten ded consequences for m y socia l life.
My habit of keepin g a sma ll group o f friends was not faring well, as it seeme d that I felt a
stron ger sense o f closeness to t hem t han they did to me. W hen I gifted Christmas presents to m y 
closest friends before Winter Break, the y were all surprised to receive thin gs from me. And thou gh
they did return the favor when school started a gain in the new year, I couldn‚Äôt i gnore this na gging
feeling that they wou ldn‚Äôt have given me an ything if I had not done so first. M y insecurit y led me
to believe t hey had only bought gifts out o f obligation rat her than friendship. T hough friendship
obvious ly isn‚Äôt measure d by the amount o f mone y spent on presents, t he seemin g lack of reciprocit y 
within the interaction bothe red me.
I t  a p p e a r e d  a s  t h o u gh I took up a small fraction of m y friends‚Äô lives while the y were
overw helmingly present in mine, inevita bly causin g a pit o f loneliness to form. I found this all
the more c hallenging to deal with because my loneliness didn‚Äôt follow me home; I cou ld live in
my hometown durin g the summer an d spen d days wit h minima l human interaction, yet this was
different. Spen ding a wee kend alone in m y apartment was a lmost su ffocatin g. When I experience d
this, I realized that livin g with m y best friends onl y emphasized the silence that arose when the y 
were gone. T his further intensi fied in t he beginnin g of my secon d year, w hen one o f my close
friends had gone back to Santa Bar bara an d my other roommate was spen ding almost a ll of her
time wit h her boyfriend.  
I didn‚Äôt know how to solve this problem without actin g selfishl y toward m y friends who had their
own lives, so I set out to fix it some other wa y. I stru ggled to match the standard of sociabilit y thatwas set by the peop le I knew, leading me to t hink this pro blem was brought about by my own bad
habits. If I became busier and took more chances, would I be able to help m yself? I‚Äôm not too sure
this is the answer, but I do think focusin g on m y own growth has helped. Appl ying to internships
and practicing my writing has kept me focuse d on t he future, w hile my free time is spent attemptin g
to socia lize. Even t he simp le act o f making plans wit h my existin g friends has improve d my friend
group‚Äôs dynamic; t hings like Sun day brunc h and watc hing the sunset are per fect opportunities for
us to bond. Thou gh it‚Äôs not perfect in an y sense of the word, I think m y life has become a bit happier .
My definition of modern love isn‚Äôt about romance, but I think I can understand certain feelin gs
associate d with relations hips. T he insecurit y about won dering whether a friend values you as 
muc h as you va lue them appears simi larly in t he dating scene. An d although the two s hare some
characteristics, friendship isn‚Äôt a p laceholder for romance, in m y humble opinion. Frien dships have
their own value that can‚Äôt be underestimated, even when certain friends are too bus y with other
things. Like all love, the fact that I care is what causes m y sense of hurt in the first place. Love isn‚Äôt
always reciproca l, a fact t hat has ma de itse lf obvious in our messy, mo dern- day rea lity. But at t his
point, I‚Äô ll take what I can get.Written b y Jade Hookham // Li festyle Contributin g Write r

Touch has always been something unnerving. So casual, but all too intimate, that it was difficult 
to pinpoint what the barrier was. Hugs from people I just met were jarring, and even familiar touches 
from friends seemed unnecessary.
It was uncomfortable and hard to process ‚Äî so I shut it away. Perhaps it was my own rigid definition of touch that contrasted the soft edges of it. To me, touch 
was a spectrum of discipline or praise; you either achieved something worthy of a hug or you made a mistake earning nothing but a firm scolding and no reassuring arm rub. Touch was something to be attained, a privilege. It was never something out of comfort or ‚Äúlove, ‚Äù but an awkward sensation that bordered on whether my actions deserved it. 
If I did not perform well, then what warranted the privilege of touch?This perception began to falter when I met a friend who will be referred to as ‚ÄúL. ‚Äù We were eleven, 
fresh into fifth grade, and she grabbed my arm so excitedly that it was difficult to register. She was taller than me, with radiant eyes that glowed in the sunlight and a personality to match. Guiding me to the class lines, she giggled amiably about our budding friendship and turned to grasp my hands 
within hers. Though perplexed, I simply let the gesture continue and smiled along, unease tingling 
in my gut as we began to walk to class.
L was generous in her friendly touches. She loved to embrace, to hold hands ‚Äî to give soft pats 
on the back for nothing and grab your arm so tight in overt excitement. I did not understand why she was overzealous with it, nor what I did to deserve gestures that were reserved for achievement. 
‚ÄúWhy do you hug me so much when I haven‚Äôt really done anything?‚Äù I laughed with her one day 
on her front step. L tossed me an amused look and nudged me gently with her shoulder, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what friends do!‚Äù 
‚ÄúJust randomly?‚Äù I withheld, my mind buzzing with confusion. Instead, I nodded and gave her a hesitant shove back, both of us chuckling at our shared exchange.
L continued to be an affectionate person, 
even as we grew apart and drifted to different groups come middle school. But, her impact 
was raw; it questioned the foundation of my 
own perspective of touch and how it could be handled. How it came out of love, care, and generosity ‚Äî how it was meant to be redistributed as an act of endearment rather than a prize to be attained.
When I joined my swim team halfway through middle school, new intersections of touch 
began to emerge. When relays placed first, we celebrated in joint slaps on the arm and a group hug. In contrast, when I lost my backstroke race by a mere second, my own disappointment was accompanied by supportive strokes to my back and a reassuring embrace that only elevated my 
spirits, despite the sense of defeat.
The everchanging expression and definition of touch helped me understand that it was a range 
of platonic or romantic affirmations; that it did not have to have a precedent of praise in order to be 
a valid expression.
It is not complete yet, but my understanding has progressed such that I know it is okay to 
reciprocate when I receive a hug or a friendly pat by the hands of the acquitenance. I know it is okay to receive a random kiss on the cheek from my partner, and to return said gesture by laying my head on their shoulder.
The physicality of it all is peaceful, and the touch of kindness is something that everyone deserves.Written by Lizzy Adams // Lifestyle Sta ff WriterThe Physicality of Touch
It takes a village to raise a child. Or in my case, an entire street fair. This street fair, located in the 
parking lot of my hometown‚Äôs one and only community college is home to a variety of unique and interesting characters. My earliest childhood memories include me running from booth to booth looking at new art pieces for sale, sipping lemonade slushies, and dancing to live bands under the desert palm trees. While my friends were watching cartoons in their homes, I was talking about 
life with the elderly vendors who sold pastel-colored clothing and calling the jewelry guy ‚ÄúCookie 
Monster‚Äù because he was grumpy and always wore blue.
I was fortunate enough to interact with vendors from all around the world. Some vendors had 
college degrees while some had barely made it out of high school. Some were very religious while some were not. When I found out the makeup vendors were not mother and son, but were two people in a committed relationship, I realized couples can come in all shapes and sizes. When I learned that a vendor man from Cuba and his best male friend were not best friends but something more, I was angrier at the fact that they couldn‚Äôt get married than the fact that they weren‚Äôt straight. It was at the street fair that I saw people love each other even though they weren‚Äôt all the same. It 
didn‚Äôt matter who you were, you would still have an array of people butting into your life in a way only friends can do.
In addition to my loving single mother, I have also grown up with an unofficial extended family. 
When I have a project for my linguistics classes, I have dozens of vendors to talk to about their 
home language. When there is a fundraiser, I have 100 vendors ready to buy whatever unnecessary desserts they can. Whenever I need advice on anything that is bothering me, I have hundreds of 
different perspectives to help me get through it all. The street fair is more than just vendors setting 
up booths every weekend, but friends and family that have each other‚Äôs backs.
The luggage vendor I have known my entire life has always said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to have friends, 
but remember this: friends come and go, but mom doesn‚Äôt. Y our mom is there for you, always. ‚Äù And while he‚Äôs entirely right, I would like to propose an edit to these words of wisdom. Not only will my mom always be there for me, but so will the people of the street fair. These vendors have told me to study hard my entire life because they did not want me to ‚Äúend up‚Äù like them. What they don‚Äôt know is that they have helped me grow into the person I am today, and I aspire to be at least half the accepting, hard-working, and caring people that they are. I know the street fair isn‚Äôt always perfect, 
but then again, what family is?Written by Samirah Martinez // Lifestyle Contributing Writer Street Fair Family 	 THE UCSD GUARDIAN | TUESDAY , FEBRUARY 20, 2018 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.OR G 

SPORTS  THE UCSD GUARDIAN | TUESDAY , FEBRUARY 20, 2018 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  15
The UC San Diego men‚Äôs 
basketball team moved to 14‚Äì6 
in California Collegiate Athletic Association play following a loss against Chico State (56‚Äì66) and a win against Humboldt State (77‚Äì57). After starting o ff the season 
strong and holding second place 
in conference standings, the 
Tritons have slid down to third place. They are now tied with Cal 
State San Marcos for the third-place spot, behind second-place Chico State and conference-leading Cal Poly Pomona. 
vs. Chico State
The Tritons played well 
against Chico State in the first 
half despite trailing 8‚Äì0 to start the game. UCSD fought to regain control of the game and traded baskets with Chico State. Both teams were evenly matched for the most part and, going into halftime, the score was 34‚Äì33 in 
favor of UCSD. 
The Tritons started the second 
half slowly, letting Chico State pull ahead early with a seven-point lead, 45‚Äì38. The Tritons 
answered back with jumpers by junior guard/forward Christian Oshita and senior forward Kenny Fraser. Chico State sank a three-pointer to keep the Wildcats ahead, but two Triton three-pointers from redshirt freshman guard Mikey Howell and junior guard Christian Bayne tied the game up at 48‚Äì48 with 10:54 remaining.
Just when it seemed like the 
momentum had swung back in favor of the Tritons, the Wildcats went on a scoring run, pulling ahead by nine points with 4:44 remaining. UCSD, however, struggled with scoring and were unable to regain control of the game. As the buzzer sounded, UCSD fell to Chico State, 56‚Äì66. 
Bayne and Oshita led the 
Tritons in scoring with 14 and 10, respectively. The Tritons were 
outrebounded by the Wildcats ‚Äî Chico State pulled 11 o ffensive 
rebounds compared to UCSD‚Äôs five. The Wildcats scored nine 
points o ff second-chance points 
versus UCSD‚Äôs two points. 
vs. Humboldt State
Rebounding from their loss 
against Chico State, the Tritons dominated the Humboldt State Lumberjacks, 77‚Äì57. In a standout showing, UCSD never trailed against Humboldt State. The Tritons led by more than 
eight points for most of the game. The first half was a stomp by the 
Tritons, and Humboldt State could not find an answer.
The Lumberjacks did, 
however, cut the lead down to two early on in the second half. Despite their scoring run, the Lumberjacks were outmatched by the Tritons. Following the run by Humboldt State, UCSD quickly turned up the intensity, easily notching a 10-point lead with 10 minutes remaining in the game. The Tritons built on this 
10-point lead and finished the 
game up by 20 points, 77‚Äì57.
UCSD shot very well from the 
field, finishing with a 49.2 field 
goal percentage and shooting 36.7 percent from behind the arc. Four Tritons finished in double-
figures: sophomore forward Scott 
Everman (16), Fraser (10), Bayne (24), and Oshita (14). 
UCSD has two more games 
remaining in the season; both are at home. The Tritons will 
play  Cal State Dominguez Hills on Thursday, Feb. 22. Tipo ff is 
scheduled for 7:30 p.m. To the tune of ‚Äú Arirang, ‚Äù an ancient 
Korean folk song about longing and 
unification, the Korean Olympic 
delegation ‚Äî a combined group of North 
and South Korean athletes ‚Äî closed out the 
2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony. 
Dressed in all white, symbolizing peace, 
the athletes marched out under the 
Korean Uni fication Flag (a white flag with 
a blue silhouette of an undivided Korean 
Peninsula) carried by one North Korean and one South Korean member of the 
joint Korean women‚Äôs hockey team. The 
message of the opening ceremony was clear: unity and concord.
Just months earlier, North Korea was 
threatening to derail the Winter Olympics. In late September of 2017, countries, like 
France, Germany, Austria, and even the U.S., expressed serious concerns over 
security, threatening to skip the Games for 
the safety of their teams. North Korea was 
seemingly more dangerous as the games 
neared; earlier that month, North Korea conducted its fifteenth nuclear missile test 
of the year (it would go on to test one more 
in November). Moreover, PyeongChang is roughly 40 miles from the demilitarized 
zone, the bu ffer zone between the two 
Koreas, and less than 200 miles from 
Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. 
At that distance, North Korea was more than capable of majorly disturbing the 
Olympics.
In the last South Korean Olympics 
(1988 Seoul Summer Olympics), North 
Korea attempted to do just that. When it was announced that Seoul would be 
hosting the 24th Summer Olympics, North Korea saw an opportunity. It proposed to 
the International Olympic Committee and 
to South Korea a joint Korean Olympics, but negotiations fell through. Abandoning 
all pretexts of unity and diplomacy, 
North Korea boycotted the 1988 Summer 
Olympics and resolved to disrupt the 
Games. In an attempt to frighten teams from attending the 1988 Seoul Olympics, 
North Korean agents planted a bomb on Korean Air Flight 858 traveling from Seoul to Baghdad; while flying over the Indian Ocean, the bomb detonated and destroyed 
the airplane, killing all 125 people (most 
of whom where South Korean) on board. Despite that, the 1988 Seoul Olympics took 
place as planned and were a tremendous 
success. South Korea was able to display 
its rapid economic development and social 
growth, paving the way for it to enter the 
international community; North Korea, on the other hand, became more isolated.
North Korea ‚Äî despite its actions of 
the prior year ‚Äî has taken a markedly 
different attitude towards the Games 
at PyeongChang. In these games, the 
two Koreas fielded a shared women‚Äôs 
hockey team and marched together in 
the opening ceremony; North Korea also sent a large group of musicians and a team 
of cheerleaders. Kim Y o Jung, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, traveled with the North Korean delegation 
to the Games and met with South Korean president Moon Jae-in. This was the first 
time since the Korean W ar that a member 
of the North Korean ruling family set 
foot in South Korea. Moon was very 
encouraged by North Korea‚Äôs participation 
in the PyeongChang Olympics: ‚Äú There 
have been many achievements in 
advancing inter-Korean talks, and I hope that this will lead to an improvement in 
inter-Korean relations. ‚Äù
Using sports to open a diplomatic 
dialogue has worked in the past. Take 
the case of the People‚Äôs Republic of China and the U.S. In the years following Mao 
Zedong‚Äôs 1949 communist revolution, the U.S. ‚Äô relationship with the PRC had been 
marked by Cold W ar propaganda, trade 
embargos, and diplomatic silence. But a fter 
nearly three decades, both nations were looking to open a dialogue with the other. 
In 1971, an opportunity for both nations 
emerged in a very unexpected place: The 
31st World Table Tennis championships in Nagoya, Japan. A chance meeting 
between American table tennis player Glenn Cowan and Chinese table tennis 
player and three-time world champion Zhuang Zedong would spark a chain of events that would lead to the li fting of the 
‚ÄúBamboo curtain. ‚Äù A fter practicing late 
one day, Cowan was forced to board the 
Chinese team bus; there he met Zedong. 
Though from adversarial nations, Zedong treated Cowan cordially, gi fting him a 
silk-screen portrait of the Huangshan 
Mountains; Cowan reciprocated with a t-shirt with the Beatles‚Äô lyric, ‚ÄúLet it Be. ‚Äù 
This unexpected good will between an 
American and a Chinese, which was well-
documented by journalists, gave the PRC 
the opportunity they were looking for. 
Mao officially invited the U.S. table tennis 
team to visit China; the team accepted. This was a monumental trip: It marked 
the first time an American had step foot 
in China since the Chinese Community 
Party came into power in 1949. What Time 
Magazine called the ‚Äúping heard round the 
world‚Äù was already resulting in diplomatic 
results. Four days into their visit, Nixon announced that the U.S. would be easing 
travel bans and economic embargoes on China; the government would soon open back-channel communication with each 
other. The following year, the Chinese 
table tennis team was invited the tour the 
U.S. But the most groundbreaking e ffect 
of what would become known as ‚ÄúPing-
Pong Diplomacy‚Äù was Nixon‚Äôs 1972 visit 
to China. Nixon ‚Äî the first US president 
to visit China ‚Äî met with the leaders of the PRC and took the first step towards 
de escalating tensions and normalizing relations.
Sport is an unexpected place to begin 
international relations. As Nixon wrote in his memoirs, regarding Sino-American relations, ‚ÄúI had never expected that the China initiative would come to fruition in 
the form of a ping pong team. ‚Äù Sports are important tools for diplomatic chess. They 
are innocuous ways for nations to express 
larger political goals, opportunity for 
interface between adversarial nations, and 
are a source of national pride. However, 
sports are not the panacea to diplomatic 
dilemmas; they are a starting point. In order for the symbolic message behind them to materialize, there has to be an 
underlying desire and willingness on both sides. Though there is no guarantee that 
the PyeongChang Olympics will resolve 
the crisis on the Korean Peninsula, North Korea‚Äôs willingness to participate is a 
reason for optimism.
