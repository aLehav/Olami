UAW Strike Enters Third Week: UC Responses, Negotiation Updates, 
and AS Support
By KAITLIN LEE /gid00015/gid00006/gid00024/gid00020/gid00001/gid00006/gid00005/gid00010/gid00021/gid00016/gid00019/gid00010/gid00002/gid00013/gid00001/gid00002/gid00020/gid00020/gid00010/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00015/gid00021
Striking graduate students continued to march during the days 
leading up to /T_hanksgiving, calling on the Univerity of Califor -
nia for fair wages and better working conditions. /T_he multi-unit 
UAW strike, which began on Nov. 14, is now heading into its third 
week. Across the UC system, academic workers, including teaching as -
sistants and research assistants, have le/f_t their classrooms and labs to 
march and form picket lines. /T_his is the largest strike at any academic 
institution in American history and the /f_irst strike ever that has in -
cluded post-doctoral students and academic workers. 
/T_here has been some progress in negotiations, but none of the prop -
ositions from the University of California have been suﬃcient to satisfy 
the union. On Nov. 15, the Oﬃce of the Provost and Executive Vice 
President for Academic Aﬀairs released a letter detailing their oﬀers in 
response to the demands of strikers. /T_hese included:
Post-Doctoral Researchers
- One year pay average increase of An average of 8% pay increase in 
year one, followed by a 5% pay increase in second yearyear two, and a 
3% increase in subsequent years. 
- A new bene/f_it for child care of $2,500 per year
- A paid leave of eight weeks to allow for baby bonding and family care 
for eligible postdocs
- Within 12 months of contract rati/f_ication, gaining aAccess to a pre-
tax card or other methods of paying transit coast within 12 months of 
contract rati/f_ication
Academic Researchers
- A 4% pay increase in year one, followed by 3% increases for subse -
quent years, totaling a 16% pay increase
- Eight weeks of paid leave for family care and bonding for Family 
Medical Leave-eligible Academic Researchers
- Access to the comprehensive retirement, medical, dental, andother 
bene/f_it programs generally available to other non-represented non-
faculty academic employees
- Access to a pre-tax card or another method for paying transit costs 
within 12 months of contract rati/f_ication 
Academic Student Employees
- A 7% pay increase within 90 days of rati/f_ication for TAs and Associate 
Instructors
- A 8.33% pay increase for Teaching Fellows
- A 3% pay increase for all salaried ASEs, and hourly-based ASEs will 
receive a 3.5% increase annually 
- Next year, TAs and Associate Instructors will be eligible for expe-
rience-based increases
- $1,350 per quarter or $2,025 per semester, plus $1,350 per summer 
for child care
- Covering 100% of campus fees for eligible ASEs with 25% or greater 
appointments 
- UC-sponsored student health plan for eligible ASEs 
- Expanded bene/f_it of eight weeks of paid pregnancy and disability 
leave and /f_ive weeks of paid baby bonding, personal medical, and fam -
ily medical leave
Graduate Student Researchers
- 9–10% increases in year one, with a 3% increase each subsequent year
- $1,350 per quarter or $2,025 per semester, plus $1,350 for summer, 
for childcare- /T_he UC system has oﬀered to cover 100% of campus fees for eligible 
GSRs
- Eligible GSRs may participate in a UC-sponsored health plan 
- Expanded bene/f_it of 8 weeks of paid pregnancy or disability leave, 
and /f_ive weeks of paid baby bonding, personal medical, and family 
medical leave
- 12 days of paid Personal Time Oﬀ 
/T_his letter received vitriol in online spaces, as many users pointed 
out that the pay increases were not enough to match the current in/f_la -
tion rate of 7.7%. Additionally, some Reddit users noted that childcare 
annually costs an average of $19,000, and the payment oﬀered to cur -
rent strikers is inadequate to cover this. 
In a Nov. 21 email sent by the Oﬃce of the Executive Vice Chancel -
lor, the oﬃce claims that the “/T_he oﬀers on the table from the [Uni -
versity of California] are equivalent to or beyond the level of what is 
oﬀered to similar employee groups at peer institutions, both public and 
private.”
Despite such reassurances, Reddit users stated that childcare ben -
e/f_its as they’re currently proposed are also not enough to cover costs 
for the childcare oﬀered at UCSD. User ‘thee-tundra’ on the r/UCSD 
subreddit noted, “Childcare at [UC San Diego] is $1,700 per month, 
and they are oﬀering $2,500 per year.”
On Nov. 16, the Associated Students at UCSD approved a joint reso -
lution with the UCSD Graduate and Professional Student Association 
in support of the UAW strike. /T_he resolution was signed by President 
Sky Yang and Vice President of Academic Aﬀairs Rhianen Callahan. 
/T_hey published their resolution on Nov. 21 on their social media pages. 
/T_he resolution listed the reasons why the strike has commenced, 
particularly the rising housing crisis in California, and especially San 
Diego becoming increasingly unaﬀordable for students. /T_he resolution 
also noted that the University of California Oﬃce of the President had 
behaved inappropriately concerning its budget and the treatment of its 
employees. 
“A 2017 state audit found the UCOP had failed to disclose $175 mil -
lion in budget reserves during a proposed tuition hike, while giving 
‘generous raises and atypical bene/f_its’ to administrative and executive 
employees of the UCOP,” the resolution detailed. “/T_he UCOP has bro -
ken California labor law by committing Unfair Labor Practices (ULPs) 
no fewer than 27 times during these negotiations, most recently on No -
vember 2nd.”
/T_he resolution further states that the GPSA and A.S. support the 
right of academic workers to strike in response to the ULPs and de -
mand that UCOP ceases both their violations of labor rights and their 
union-busting attempts; they demand that they oﬀer the UAW a fair 
contract so that the academic quarter can commence. 
“/T_he Associated Students of UC San Diego stand in solidarity with 
the UAW and support the resolution approved by the Graduate and 
Professional Student Association on November 14, 2022,” the resolu -
tion aﬃrms.

Fax: 858-534-7035A new study published by 
Maxim Bazhenov Lab at UC San 
Diego found that replicating sleep 
in spiking neural networks allows 
for these networks to learn new 
tasks without forgetting old ones.
Arti/f_icial neural networks 
contain multiple layers of inter -
connected computer-simulated 
neurons. According to IBM, the 
most basic ANNs have 3 layers: 
an input layer, a hidden layer, and 
an output layer. ANNs can oper -
ate through communication be -
tween the diﬀerent neurons, and 
depending on what signals are 
received, a neuron may or may 
not transmit the signal to the next 
node. 
In this study, the authors used spiking neural networks. SNNs 
are similar to ANNs, but they are 
more similar to human neurons 
by communicating continuously 
through discrete electric events 
known as spikes, while ANNs ….  
One of the major problems 
experimenters have while using 
SNNs is that they can only re -
tain one task at a time. If an SNN 
is taught to do a new task it for -
gets how to do the last one. /T_his 
is called “catastrophic forgetting”.
/T_his problem can be solved 
by simultaneously teaching two 
tasks at once. However, this re -
quires the simultaneous use of the 
training data sets for both tasks. 
While improving what SNNs are 
capable of, this method does not 
replicate the continuous learning 
of the human brain. 
Fourth year PhD student and co-lead author, Erik Delanois, 
provided this analogy: “If you 
spend some time learning how to 
play golf and you take a break and 
learn how to play tennis, you’re 
not going to forget how to play 
golf just because you learned how 
to play tennis”. 
/T_he researchers found that af -
ter a /f_irst task is learned, a second 
task can be learned if the learn -
ing period is mixed with periods 
of “sleep.” More speci/f_ically, the 
researchers developed a model 
for REM, or rapid eye movement 
sleep. /T_his type of sleep has been 
implicated in the consolidation of 
procedural memories. 
A/f_ter the neurons learned 
one task, the researchers inter -
wove sleep with the learning of 
a second task. /T_heoretically, this 
allows the SNN to replay the old task while concurrently learn -
ing the new task. At the end of 
the training period, the SNN was 
able to complete both tasks with -
out any catastrophic forgetting 
and provided new insights to how 
REM sleep contributes to memo -
ry consolidation.
“It helps to visualize and un -
derstand what synapses could po -
tentially be doing in biology. It’s a 
good example and illustration of 
what’s going on under the hood,” 
Delanois said.

Our generation has been de -
scribed as one of the most le/f_t-
leaning generations in recent 
history. However, we aren’t the 
/f_irst generation to be described 
this way. Generations from the 
‘60s and ‘70s were similarly de -
scribed as very le/f_t-leaning, even 
le/f_t-wing or socialist. /T_his trend, 
however, didn’t last forever. By 
the ‘80s, these young people, now 
adults, were some of the most 
conservative voters and led Ron -
ald Reagan’s conservative revolu -
tion. So the question arises as to 
why these young liberal voters 
became so conservative. /T_here 
are many theories, but the most 
agreeable and well-evidenced is 
likely that there was a change due 
to material conditions. /T_he young 
activists of the 1960s and 1970s 
became the well-paid homeown -
ers of the 1980s. When it came to 
voting, they voted conservative 
because conservatism protected 
their material interests. As pros -
perous Americans, tax cuts, and 
free market capitalism provided 
them opportunities and pro -
tected their established wealth. 
/T_hese activists-turned-conser -
vatives were almost always white 
and straight, and as a result had 
a desire to keep the social system 
which places them /f_irst. From this 
historical case, and the parallels 
between then and now, I pose 
the question: will this happen to 
our generation? /T_he UAW strike 
opposition and the movement of 
general public opinion post 2020 
leads me to believe that our gen -eration will have the same con -
servative reaction as the 1980s, 
possibly more reactionary and 
even farther right. 
/T_he UAW strike, and the sub -
sequent reaction of students on 
campus demonstrates that our 
student population, even those 
self-described as le/f_t-leaning, will 
always choose their own material 
interest over the progress of ac -
tivism. /T_here is no formal poll or 
data taken of the undergraduate 
student population to gauge sup -
port, but as of now there seems to 
be a large support base. However, 
there seems to be a growing mi -
nority of dissenters who oppose 
the strike. /T_hese dissenters can 
be seen all over the UC San Diego 
Reddit. Some of these posts have 
hundreds of upvotes and are full 
of the type of concerns that seem 
to mirror those of the 1980 activ -
ist converts. For example, a post 
by a Reddit user expressed their 
anger at the strike and the “ha -
rassment.” What is most critical 
to note here is the section about 
money, as the student claims that 
the source of their grievance is 
due to the fact that they have a 
material stake in their education 
and cannot aﬀord this strike. In 
fact, the most common thread 
of all strike-related complaints is 
money. Another user compared 
UCSD to a business and as such 
rejected the strike. Another user 
called the strikers “entitled” and 
once again brought up the con -
cept of money, tuition, and their 
/f_inancial loss. All of these dis -
senters /f_ind issue with the strike 
because it interferes with their 
/f_inances. /T_he strike threatens 
their material conditions, and as a result any semblance of solidar -
ity or le/f_t-wing activism is disre -
garded with blame being placed 
on dissenters rather than those 
undervaluing them as well as un -
dergraduate students. /T_his is not 
a small or isolated incident, but a 
warning sign of a shi/f_t to come. 
/T_hose in our generation who have 
the option to become part of the 
system as it is, due to their privi -
lege, will do so. Once they have 
solidi/f_ied their position, they will 
do anything to protect it. 
However, this trend does not 
end with the strike, and is further 
evidenced online with our gener -
ation’s growing approval of Elon 
Musk. Recently, businessman 
Elon Musk purchased Twitter 
and established himself as a large 
presence on the platform. Ac -
cording to YouGov, 44% of young 
Democrats approve of Musk and 
his management of the platform. 
/T_his might seem to be fairly un -
assuming, but Musk’s reign on 
Twitter has revealed a heavy 
right-wing streak. /T_here are nu -
merous examples of this, such as 
in a recently deleted tweet where 
Musk called the fatal shooting of 
unarmed Black teenager Michael 
Brown “/f_iction.”  Additionally, 
Musk has liked tweets that claim 
the deaths on Jan. 6, 2021 were in -
/f_lated and the Black Lives Matter 
movement had “100s of deaths.” 
Musk has also been engaging 
with white supremacists online, 
such as when he liked a quote 
tweet agreeing with Twitter user 
RAMZPAUL. RAMZPAUL, also 
known as Paul Ray Ramsey, is a 
notorious white supremacist and 
white nationalist who has an en -
tire page dedicated to him on the Southern Poverty Law Center’s 
website on /f_ighting hate speech. 
Additionally, Musk has unsus -
pended Kanye West, who recently 
said a series of antisemitic com -
ments. West has also  announced 
a 2024 presidential campaign that 
prominently features white su -
premacist Nick Fuentes and called 
for  what seems to be a Christian 
/T_heocracy.Fuentes is well-known 
for his Holocaust denial, for being 
an organizer of the Charlottes -
ville “Unite the Right” rally, and 
for being a self-proclaimed white 
nationalist. Musk, through his ac -
tions, is not only actively support -
ing right-wing conspiracies, but 
is also giving platforms to white 
nationalists and Holocaust de -
niers. /T_hrough it all, Musk’s sup -
port has only grown. /T_he YouGov 
poll previously mentioned, which 
was released on Nov. 17, showed 
his support among young Demo -
crats, and he maintains 119 mil -
lions followers and growing. 
/T_his demonstrates for our 
generation a concerning trend. 
Although for now we can rejoice 
in the 2022 youth voter turnout, 
and its ability to bring signi/f_icant 
change, we need to prevent the 
rising tide of right-wing politics 
in our generation if we want it to 
keep its status as a generation that 
brings a positive change. /T_his call 
to action is even more urgent than 
it has ever been, as the popular -
ity of /f_igures such as Musk, West, 
and Donald Trump demonstrate 
a growing trend of something 
more dangerous and radical than 
Reagan era conservatism. /T_he ris -
ing trend of right-wing /f_igures 
/f_inds itself to be /f_irmly on the side 
of white nationalism. /T_his is not Union-Busters, Elon Musk, and Kanye West:

Pradeep Khosla was appointed 
as the chancellor of UC San Di -
ego in 2012. Since then, UCSD 
has been experiencing dramatic 
growth, with construction and 
project planning expected to ex -
tend into the 2030s. 
Chancellor Khosla has ap -
proved $6.5 billion dollars worth 
of construction projects over the 
course of his time at UCSD, ex -
panding the university to tower 
above La Jolla Shores. 
/T_he need for such projects 
strays from the state’s demand 
for the UC system to admit more 
students. More students require 
more housing with an addition of 
spaces for learning and collabora -
tion. 
Currently, UCSD plans to ex -
pand its central La Jolla campus 
with the construction of Eighth 
College and the Pepper Canyon 
Living and Learning Neighbor -
hood.
Oﬀ campus, the university 
plans to extend south towards 
downtown San Diego. With a 
growing in/f_luence on the city, 
UCSD plans to redevelop its Hill -
crest Campus over a 15-year pe -
riod and has its eyes set on neigh -
borhoods in south San Diego 
county to be utilized for staﬀ and 
student housing.  
With such rapid expansion 
comes inevitable consequences. 
Construction on campus is 
overseen by LEED, a green-build -
ing rating system that certi/f_ies 
buildings on the following scale: 
Platinum (an A-grade), Gold (a 
B-grade), and Silver (a C-grade).The New Neighbor Next Door

A building quali/f_ies for a Plati -
num certi/f_ication when 80 points 
are earned. Credits are earned 
based on the building’s contribu -
tions to climate change, impacts 
on human health, usage of natural 
resources, and the bene/f_its that the 
building brings to the community.  
UCSD’s on-campus construc -
tion development currently has a 
Silver, or a C- grade. 
Former Academic Senate 
member Dr. Eric Halgren, said 
that research has shown that the 
silver certi/f_ication is not associ -
ated with any decreased energy 
usage. 
Further, the certi/f_ication isn’t 
as green as UCSD portrays it to be, 
having little to no eﬀect on overall 
emissions. 
UCSD’s Long Range Develop -
ment Plan estimates a 15.6 to 27.8 
million square feet expansion of 
the campus by 2035.
“It’s a lot, ” Halgren said in re -
sponse to the LDRP’s estimate. 
“We need to rethink that. I think 
[UCSD] has to grow, it’s a duty 
and mission. But we don’t have to 
physically grow as much as they 
are planning. ” 
A/f_ter reviewing the univer -
sity’s LDRP , Halgren mentioned 
that UCSD failed to create a stan -
dard or estimate on the carbon 
footprint of the construction itself. 
UCSD’s latest LDRP was pro -
posed back in 2019. According to 
Halgren, the 2019 LDRP report is 
now outdated because it was writ -
ten in a pre-pandemic world and 
fails to account for newly derived 
data. 
/T_he latest LDRP entailed in -
formation on current and pro -
posed land use development, open 
space, transportation, utilities, in -frastructure, and sustainability. 
When asked about UCSD’s ef -
fort to look for eco-friendly solu -
tions to its construction boom, 
Halgren said, “ As far as I know, 
they aren’t even looking at the car -
bon cost of construction. /T_here’s 
a lot of options, and they’re not 
thinking that way. ” 
With expansion comes the 
need for more energy resources 
to fuel not only electric power, but 
water, sewage, cooling, and heat -
ing units as well. Moreover, Dr. 
Halgren highlighted that the pro -
duction of cement and steel gener -
ates an abundance of greenhouse 
gasses and thus, a larger carbon 
footprint. 
85% of the university’s energy 
is generated by the on-campus 
Central Utilities Plant, which 
is powered by fracked methane 
with carbon emissions that have 
stayed consistent over the past 
few decades. /T_here is no sign that 
the operation of the cogeneration 
plant will stop anytime soon. /T_he 
university is still paying oﬀ the co -
generation plant and has plans to 
keep it through the 2030s. 
As a result, UCSD purchases 
carbon oﬀsets in order to mitigate 
their carbon footprint. 
According to Halgren, UCSD 
purchases foreign land, on which 
forests are intentionally preserved. 
/T_hese trees then produce a suﬃ -
cient supply of oxygen that oﬀsets 
the amount of carbon the univer -
sity is burning. 
“What if there’s a huge /f_ire? 
What if a right wing government 
takes over? What if [someone is] 
paid to not cut trees down where 
the land was bought, but they cut 
more [somewhere else]?” Halgren 
said. “Or maybe the land is cleared out, and nobody ever noticed. ” 
Socially speaking, the con -
struction boom has le/f_t both stu -
dents and San Diegans with a mix 
of emotions. 
When asked about the bene/f_its 
of the university’s construction, 
Associated Students President Sky 
Y ang noted that “the university’s 
expansion would bene/f_it, if not all, 
most of us” . 
Y ang highlighted that more 
construction will lead to more 
parking, academic spaces, and 
housing units to tend to the grow -
ing UCSD student community.   
However, Y ang also touched 
on the detrimental eﬀects of con -
struction. 
“/T_he eﬀects are uncertain, ” 
Y ang said. “It’s more construction 
on native land. Due to the trolley 
system, housing will also be more 
expensive around the stations. ” 
San Diego State University 
Professor of Urban Studies An -
drew Wiese noted that construc -
tion and the housing market are 
pressing issues in the San Diego 
community.
“We’ve got plenty of market 
rate housing; it’s that we don’t have 
aﬀordable housing, ” Wiese said. 
Current housing projects are 
set to be priced at or 20% below 
market rates. Market rates have 
spiked a 10% increase from in/f_la -
tion this past year and have stayed 
expensive over the past decades. 
/T_he development of projects 
on campus are also sparking moti -
vation for private development in 
the surrounding areas. 
Rock Bottom Brewery, located 
at 8980 Villa La Jolla Dr., is now 
the construction site of UCSD’s 
newest oﬃce building. /T_his site 
is the /f_irst project that UCSD is working on in collaboration with 
a private developer from Los An -
geles. 
“Businesses in the northeast 
part of campus may be seeing 
displacement impacts as well as 
apartment renters, ” Wiese said. 
“Small business owners are be -
ing pushed out of their aﬀordable 
commercial spaces. ”
UCSD has also purchased a 
$42-million apartment building 
in East Village, an area that has 
already been subject to gentri/f_ica -
tion. 
Wiese further explained that 
there is a possibility of UCSD 
creating “bad neighbors” if they 
decide to extend connections 
with private developers. Doing 
so opens the door to the ability to 
skip extra steps, such as processes 
of review held by city and commu -
nity members. 
Regardless, UCSD is leaving a 
growing mark on its surrounding 
community as students pour into 
the university. /T_herefore, UCSD 
has an obligation as an institution 
to provide accessible education to 
applicable students, according to 
Halgren. 
But underlying issues continue 
to grow. 
“We’re heading oﬀ a cliﬀ, 
and [UCSD] took their foot oﬀ  
the gas a little bit, ” Halgren said. 
“It’s the pro/f_it motive. It gets as 
overwhelmingly important [for 
UCSD] as it is in our society, then 
it causes the destruction we see. ”

Texas-bred musical collective Brockhampton released their /f_inal two projects, “/T_he 
Family” and “TM,” on Nov. 17 and 18, respectively, bringing the beloved hip-hop group’s 
six-year musical run to a rather /f_lat end. 
“/T_he Family” was /f_irst announced as Brockhampton’s /f_inal album during the group’s 
2022 Coachella set in April, shortly a/f_ter they canceled an international tour and an -
nounced their inde/f_inite hiatus. “TM”, on the other hand, came as a surprise to fans as it 
was announced on social media less than 24 hours before it dropped and mere hours a/f_ter 
“/T_he Family” was released. 
/T_he self-proclaimed “best boy band since One Direction” began back in 2011 when 
frontman Kevin Abstract posted on a Kanye West fan forum asking if anyone wanted to 
join his band. He ended up with an array of creatives from vocalists to producers, and in 
2016, they released their debut album “All American Trash,” recorded in their shared Los 
Angeles home. /T_he album was accompanied by a YouTube documentary that captured 
the group’s raw and organic musical process. 
/T_he album was followed in 2017 by “/T_he Saturation Trilogy,” a collection of three 
albums that were released over the span of a year. /T_he trilogy established the group’s 
cathartic and experimental sound, with threads of R&B and pop rap tying the projects 
together and earning the band critical acclaim. Fresh oﬀ of the success of the trilogy, the 
band signed to record label RCA Records in 2018 and put out three albums in the follow -
ing three years, “Iridescence,” “Ginger,” and “Roadrunner,” under the label. 
Compared to earlier projects, “/T_he Family” and “TM” are too blatantly underwhelm -
ing to serve as their musical farewell. On “Big [P----],” the lead single from “/T_he Family,” 
Abstract implies that the album was made primarily to conclude obligations to RCA. He 
raps, “/T_he label needed 35 minutes of music,” and this is blatantly evident in the music. 
Both albums, although starkly diﬀerent, shed the distinctive sound and unpredictable 
nature of previous Brockhampton projects, making for a rather dull and dispensable lis -
tening experience. 
“/T_he Family,” essentially a Kevin Abstract solo project, is full of reminiscent raps and 
re/f_lective verses that delve into the hardships that Abstract and the band have endured 
over the years. Although the soulful choirs and cheery production package the album as 
a stroll down memory lane, it is more of a breathless jog. From kicking out Ameer Van, 
one of the group’s founding members, a/f_ter he was accused of multiple counts of sexual 
assault, to going viral on TikTok with the song “Sugar,” “/T_he Family” is a confessional 
farewell, a retrospective on all that the band has been through. 
While this makes for somewhat of an interesting listening experience for those who 
have been following the group for a while, the fact that such re/f_lection only seems to be 
coming from Abstract is a little puzzling and almost detracts from the purpose.
From his self-awareness on “Any Way You Want Me” when he interjects with “that’s 
such a toxic bar” while singing about changing himself for a lover, to his introspection on 
“RZA” where he sings “All of the songs where I dissed my mom helped me help her stay 
in her home,” Abstract is brutally honest on “/T_he Family.” 
While this would be wonderful had it been marketed as a solo album, it seems to contradict the family-oriented atmosphere of the album that Abstract established. “/T_he 
Family” tackles the raw repercussions of being launched into fame, from the commodi -
/f_ication of passion to contemplating material wealth, and it would have been neat to hear 
the rest of the group’s perspectives on these topics. 
On the other hand, “TM” is composed of shelved Brockhampton demos from 2021, 
so although, it was the band’s /f_inal album, it was technically recorded before “/T_he Fam -
ily.” /T_his is evident in the production quality and lyrical arrangements throughout. Even 
“/T_he Family,” despite its /f_laws, had a crisp and polished feel to it. /T_he tracks on “TM” just 
sound messy.
Admittedly, “TM” is a little closer to Brockhampton’s overarching sound and aesthet -
ic than “/T_he Family,” with its hazy electronic production and drowned-out falsettos that 
feel like “All-American Trash” and “Iridescence” mixed together. But the tracks almost 
feel like they’re spilling onto each other, leaving the album as a whole rather washed out. 
/T_here are some high points on the album, like the track “New Shoes,” which features 
rap verses from Meryln Woods and Matt Champion and a catchy ‘90s-style beat, and 
“Keep it Southern,”  which has an almost industrial feel to it.  
As stand-alone singles, the tracks aren’t terrible, but in the context of the entire proj -
ect and the weight that this project carries as the group’s /f_inal, they are not as elevated or 
unique as would have been expected. 
While the lyrics on “/T_he Family” felt pointed and relevant, the lyrics on “TM” made 
me genuinely question why the tracks were on the album. Tracks like “Man on the Moon” 
and “Better /T_hings” are sickeningly sweet and rather mediocre, far from the sonic enigma 
that Brockhampton once was. Others like “Duct Tape” and “Goodbye” feature drowned-
out vocals and low-/f_i beats that honestly sound more like background music than a poi -
gnant, powerful farewell.  
/T_he band initially made waves in the industry for the way that they were ditching 
labels and defying taboos, from embracing openly queer members (and making mu -
sic about the queer experience) to rejecting traditional genre constraints. Given their 
groundbreaking trajectory over the years, “/T_he Family” and “TM” just fall short.  
“/T_he Family” makes it clear that the band has been on a downward trajectory for a 
while, with Abstract rapping, “We said we’d do this [s---] for life now I’m the last one 
tryin,” on the titular track of “/T_he Family.” And “TM” seems to support that with its 
lackluster production and redundant beats. It very much felt like the band was done. 
/T_he group oﬃcially came to an end on Nov. 19 with Brockhampton’s /f_inal show, 
which was held at the Fonda in Los Angeles for free. /T_he show was broadcast on Amazon 
Music’s Twitch channel for fans to tune into, and the group played a slew of tracks from 
each of their albums, thankfully omitting most of their newer songs.
Many members plan on returning to their solo careers now that the band has split, 
and it will be interesting to hear if and how being part of this collective in/f_luences their 
individual sound. /T_he end of Brockhampton is truly the end of an era. Although it’s bit -
tersweet, the release of “/T_he Family” and “TM” ever so slightly so/f_tened the blow by reas -
suring that the group’s best days truly were behind them./gid00035/gid00081/gid00078/gid00066/gid00074/gid00071/gid00064/gid00076/gid00079/gid00083/gid00078/gid00077/gid00008/gid00082/gid00001/gid00069/gid00064/gid00081/gid00068/gid00086/gid00068/gid00075/gid00075/gid00001/gid00079/gid00081/gid00078/gid00073/gid00068/gid00066/gid00083/gid00082/gid00001/gid00067/gid00068/gid00079/gid00064/gid00081/gid00083/gid00001/gid00069/gid00081/gid00078/gid00076/gid00001/gid00083/gid00071/gid00068/gid00001/gid00070/gid00081/gid00078/gid00084/gid00079/gid00008/gid00082/gid00001/gid00084/gid00077/gid00072/gid00080/gid00084/gid00068/gid00013/gid00001/gid00066/gid00081/gid00068/gid00064/gid00083/gid00072/gid00085/gid00068/gid00001

About a month ago, Kit Con -
nor returned to Twitter a/f_ter a 
self-imposed hiatus. His mes -
sage was simple: “back for a min -
ute. i’m bi. congrats for forcing 
an [18-year-old] to out himself. 
i think some of you missed the 
point of the show. bye” 
Kit Connor was catapulted 
into popularity with the success 
of his show “Heartstopper,” where 
he plays a teenage boy who falls 
for his best friend and discov -
ers he is bisexual. Connor deliv -
ered an emotional performance 
through the 10-episode season 
and connected with audiences as 
his character made sense of his 
sexuality. Because of this, some 
fans believed that he himself was 
a part of the LGBTQ community. 
/T_hey relentlessly pestered Con -
nor about his sexual orientation 
and identity and pressured him to 
come out. He responded that he 
never felt the need to label him -
self, especially publicly. However, 
a/f_ter he was pictured holding 
hands with a female co-star, he 
was hassled for a diﬀerent reason: queerbaiting. 
Queerbaiting is a marketing 
practice. It’s the act of implying 
or teasing an LGBTQ relation -
ship or attraction for the sake of 
gaining appeal without following 
through. It is o/f_ten used in TV 
shows to attract a queer audience, 
like in “Riverdale” when the two 
female main characters kissed as 
an attention grabber — the event 
was never addressed later on in 
the series. It’s because of situa -
tions like those in “Riverdale” 
why I think it’s important to clar -
ify the de/f_inition of this phrase as 
it is o/f_ten misused.  
/T_his type of event is becom -
ing ridiculously commonplace, 
where celebrities are accused of 
queerbaiting and feel pressured to 
come out. It’s happened with sing -
ers like Harry Styles and other fa -
mous personalities. But it is espe -
cially commonplace with actors 
in queer shows. Fans badgered 
Michael Cimino of “Love, Victor” 
and Edvin Ryding of “Young Roy -
als” into an answer about their 
sexuality as well. Cimino had to 
make a statement about identi -

a comment on his sexuality, but 
discusses the importance of his 
character being unlabeled. 
Fans of celebrities or shows 
will o/f_ten pressure these bigger 
stars into giving us information 
that we aren’t entitled to. Sexuali -
ty is a personal, intimate, and pri -
vate matter. Obviously, it can be 
wonderful to /f_ind pride in one’s 
sexuality or the LGBTQ commu -
nity itself, but it isn’t necessary. 
Actors do not owe us any infor -
mation about how they identify, 
especially when we live in a world 
that can be unkind to those who 
are queer. Additionally, sexuality 
is incredibly /f_luid. It can change 
as people evolve and it’s some -
thing people discover as they live. 
Playing a queer character could 
be the catalyst for an actor to dis -
cover that they are queer them -
selves. /T_here are so many ways to 
be a part of the queer community. 
Some might discover that part 
of themselves later in life. Some 
might never /f_ind a label that feels 
comfortable to them. Whatever 
journey one goes on, it shouldn’t 
have to be broadcast to the world. 
/T_here is something special 
about the authenticity of having queer actors play queer charac -
ters. /T_his can be seen in shows 
like “Heartstopper,” where many 
of the actors are a part of the LG -
BTQ community, but there are 
also a lot of risks that come with 
playing these roles. First (and 
most obviously), there are people 
who /f_ind baseless reasons to dis -
parage the queer community. Ad -
ditionally, playing a queer char -
acter seems to open the doors for 
any and all speculation from the 
fanbase. It isn’t easy to contend 
with the constant questions about 
sexuality, coming from inter -
viewers and fans. /T_his is part of 
the reason why I think that only 
queer actors playing queer char -
acters can be tricky. /T_his logic al -
lows only actors who are out to the 
public or comfortable being out 
to the public to play these char -
acters. Otherwise, as we’ve seen, 
fans will demand any kind of in -
formation and when they don’t 
get it, they start blaming these 
actors. However, representation 
is important, speci/f_ically respect -
ful representation. I used to be a 
/f_irm believer that queer charac -
ters should be played by queer 
actors. /T_hese kinds of events have de/f_initely shi/f_ted my perspective. 
I would argue that having queer 
writers and directors involved in 
the process matters more. /T_hey 
can ensure that the type of au -
thenticity that resonates with 
these audiences is depicted. Writ -
ers can portray thoughtful and 
meaningful scenes for these char -
acters. Directors can cra/f_t a nar -
rative that echoes with audiences 
through their own experiences. 
As long as actors who play queer 
characters handle the role with 
grace and introspection, I think it 
can be okay if they don’t identify 
as queer. 
I feel so strongly for Kit Con -
nor and other celebrities who 
have to deal with this nonsense. 
For Connor, his castmates and 
other fans were supportive, oﬀer -
ing him well wishes and frown -
ing upon the circumstances of his 
coming out. I think especially for 
someone working on a show that 
means so much to so many people 
like “Heartstopper,” this can be 
diﬃcult. We need to learn from 
this event. Celebrities are people 
too. /T_hey deserve to live their lives 
without constant speculation and 
judgment. BY Laila Del Rio

A Barrio Renaissance
What a time to be alive today in the roaring twenty twenty’s. /T_here is a renaissance 
underway, evident in the upspring of an appreciation of art, community, and culture. It 
seems as if a/f_ter our collective experience of isolation during the pandemic there is an 
excitement and a refreshment in being together and making art. Reclaiming space to 
allow community members to unite and appreciate each other’s existence and talent is a 
blessing and an act of resistance. Street Art has historically been a vehicle for nourishing 
and inspiring working class communities by communicating powerful messages through 
beautiful and encaptivating creations. /T_his is the history and tradition that is celebrated 
in locally owned art spaces in San Diego’s Barrio Logan.
Community wide celebrations of the arts and culture help create a safe and loving en -
vironment for everyone within it. /T_his is what makes Art Galleries found in and around 
Logan Avenue so important. UC San Diego Students are encouraged to support local 
artists generously sharing their art this holiday season by visiting and investing in their work. /T_hese photos were captured during November’s Barrio Art Crawl at Mi Vida Logan, 
a pop-up art show visible through Dec. 10 and open /T_hursday through Sunday from 2 p.m.-
7 p.m.. Curated by Bucky, a brilliant local artist and curator, the pop-up show is a space you 
can learn about, admire, and get the opportunity to purchase locally cra/f_ted pieces. Behind 
each piece within the pop-up is a powerful story, and talented individual. You can /f_ind it 
by typing 2190 National Ave, San Diego, Califas into your GPS. Don’t miss the next Bar -
rio Art crawl which takes place every second Saturday from 2 p.m.-8 p.m.. /T_he Art Crawl 
includes 30+ studios and stretches all the way to Libelula book store, where you’ll /f_ind LA 
Tiny Gallery inside the magical shop. LA Tiny Gallery is a gem and will showcase only San 
Diego’s most talented artists like this month’s storyteller and analog photographer Fedella 
Lizeth. /T_here is so much power in where we put our dollars, so use yours this season to sup -
port and show love to local artists. We thank them for their talent and artistry that helps 
preserve tradition and culture, and gives life the vibrant colors we love.LIFESTYLE/C.cap/O.cap/N.cap/T.cap/A.cap/C.cap/T.cap /T.cap/H.cap/E.cap /E.cap/D.cap/I.cap/T.cap/O.cap/R.cap

 I Watched Every Disney Channel Holiday Special So You 
Don’t Have To
By ROSABELLA Debty
/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
Picture this: it’s December 
2010, 8 p.m. EST/5 p.m. PST, and 
“Fa-La-La-La Days” on Disney 
Channel has once again made 
its return. If you were fancy, you 
might’ve pre-recorded the holiday 
episode reruns from years past. 
/T_here was something so festive 
about a break in a show’s usual 
plot for a holiday special, or the 
commercial breaks where actors 
would share their holiday plans. 
I haven’t had cable in years, so 
I’m not sure if this is still a thing, 
but Disney+ graciously has every 
available holiday episode in one, 
neat row. Now, the questions you 
may ask are: where do I begin? 
Which order should I watch them 
in? Why is this more stressful than 
Black Friday Shopping? Have no 
fear, though, as I took the liberty 
of rewatching every Disney Chan -
nel holiday special so you don’t 
have to. I will name my top three 
favorites, a couple of runner-
ups, and episodes you really just 
shouldn’t revisit. I’m making the 
list, but you don’t have to check it 
twice. Just relax, make some hot 
cocoa, and be ready to be trans -
ported back to your childhood.
Now, I must preface that there 
is a worthy amount of cringe-
worthy moments in some of these 
episodes. One episode that I didn’t 
remember being quite as cheesy 
when I /f_irst watched it as a lowly 
10-year-old was “Jingle it Up, ” the 
holiday special for Season 2 of 
“Shake it Up. ” While it unfortu -
nately did not make my top three, 
I still recommend you watch it — 
just be prepared to ask yourself if 
you ever truly thought Flynn was 
singing Ave Maria.
For my top three episodes, I 
will start with bronze. Crossover 
episodes always made them favor -
ites, but Christmas crossover epi -
sodes? /T_hat might be life-altering. 
/T_he crossover between “Good 
Luck Charlie” and “Jessie” in 2013 
was a cultural reset. I can’t say it 
was my absolute favorite, which 
is why it got third place, but the hour-long episode is full of jokes, 
dramatic plot twists (c’mon, Sky, 
PJ just wants to be with you!) 
and it was nice to watch it a/f_ter 
so long. If you didn’t watch either 
show, though, this may not be the 
episode for you — because unlike 
most holiday specials, it still fol -
lowed the overarching plot of both 
shows instead of making a diﬀer -
ent one. 
“/T_he Proud Family” aired the 
year I was born, so I didn’t grow 
up waiting weekly for the next 
episode. However, I remembered 
seeing the episode “Seven days 
of Kwanzaa” as a rerun, and now 
I believe it had some of the best 
values of the holiday season out 
of the episodes I watched. It was 
a close second, and honestly could 
be tied with /f_irst. Not only do we 
see what the holidays should be 
about — helping out those who 
are less fortunate than us — but 
also we get an episode dedicated 
to learning about a holiday other 
than Christmas, as alluded to in 
the episode title (and you have 
to love how the sass from Suga 
Mama moves the plot along). 
Gold, in all honesty, will prob -
ably always go to “Phineas and 
Ferb: Christmas Vacation, ” their 
holiday episode of Season 2. /T_his 
one came out in December 2009, 
three weeks before I moved away 
from a life I was growing com -
fortable in. I remember watching 
it for the /f_irst time on my very-
2000’s princess TV and becom -
ing enthralled with the storyline: 
What happens when a whole 
town is on the naughty list? Even 
now, a whole 13 years later, there 
is something magical about this 
episode and how everyone comes 
together to /f_ix the wrong. /T_he in -
novative minds of Phineas and 
Ferb take the classic “let’s help 
Santa save Christmas!” plotline 
and revamps it into an unforget -
table special that everyone should 
watch at least once in their life. 
We get not one, not two, but three 
inventions from the classic step-
brothers. Also, I forgot how much 
I loved “Santa’s Helpers” and their 
sarcasm, so if you watch for noth -ing else, watch for the little elf with 
the stylish mustache. 
Okay, I know I said crossovers 
instantly make an episode better, 
but one episode I believe you can 
go without watching this holiday 
is the one between “Jessie” and 
“ Austin & Ally. ” It isn’t terrible, but 
honestly, the song at the begin -
ning was the best part. /T_he whole 
con/f_lict of Trish accidentally call -
ing a pizza place instead of Times 
Square is just a little too cringe-
worthy, even for Disney Channel. 
But also, there are plot holes: the 
fact that his opening song is at a 
mall with only a few onlookers 
and is meant to be a set, but yet 
at this point in the show he is al -
ready viral and good enough to be 
booked at Times Square (a/f_ter the 
whole mix-up is resolved) doesn’t 
add up. Maybe I read a little too 
much into this one, but there were 
a lot of contradictions that I found 
myself pausing the show to con -
template them more than I found 
myself watching. 
/T_he last episode I would 
say is probably good to skip is “Bizaardvark”’s “ Agh, Humbug. ” I 
will say, there may be a bias here 
because I stopped watching a lot 
of Disney Channel shows a/f_ter 
we got rid of cable — which was 
before this show aired — so there 
may be context that I am miss -
ing that skews my perception. I 
apologize to any fans of this show 
in advance. I didn’t realize Olivia 
Rodrigo was in this — or Jake 
Paul, for what it’s worth — so it 
was interesting seeing her acting 
outside of  “ American Girl” and 
“High School Musical: /T_he Musi -
cal, /T_he Series. ” A reason this epi -
sode can be put on the back burn -
er in my opinion came within the 
/f_irst three minutes. /T_he plot of the 
episode starts with a school-wide 
Secret Santa, however, the age-old 
joke of Gen-Z being glued to their 
phones has now resulted in just a 
school-wide “Santa, ” because the 
students wouldn’t be able to keep 
a secret. And then there is a guy 
with a horse mask on — if anyone 
has watched this, please let me 
know if he is a recurring charac -
ter; I don’t have the heart to binge the show. 
All of that to say, I want to 
end on a cheery — maybe cheesy 
— note. No matter how much I 
cringed at some of these episodes, 
the nostalgia of watching them 
in preparation for Christmas had 
me feeling North Carolina cold 
in sunny San Diego (so did the 
wind advisory, but that is a dif -
ferent story). I wanted to go buy 
hot chocolate mix and put on my 
pug Christmas socks. Time isn’t 
slowing down, but I feel like I 
got a taste of that childhood fes -
tive spirit with this challenge I put 
on myself. Whatever holiday you 
celebrate this winter season, I en -
courage you to revisit something 
you might have done as a child, 
and re/f_lect on how it is diﬀerent 
now that you are older. I hope 
you check out the episodes I high -
light, and possibly even the ones I 
don’t! But please, whatever you do, 
stop with the fruit cake — Disney 
needs a new food to hate on.
How to Catch Santa
By VIGGO KOVAS
/gid00004/gid00016/gid00015/gid00021/gid00019/gid00010/gid00003/gid00022/gid00021/gid00010/gid00015/gid00008/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
Santa Claus: the man, the 
myth, the legend himself. We’ve 
all heard of him and his insane 
feat of traveling across the globe 
in the span of just a few hours, 
making him 3,000 times the speed 
of sound! What amazes me the 
most is how someone so popular 
has yet to be seen by the masses. 
Luckily for you, dear reader, I 
am not a part of the masses, and 
I have a plan on how to see San -
ta. /T_hat’s right, today I’m here to 
teach you how to capture the infa -
mous Santa Claus.
Now, everyone knows that 
Santa enters homes from the 
chimney, which is exactly why we 
set up traps in the vents. If Santa 
was easy enough to catch by just 
setting up nets in your chimney, 
he would have been caught many 
eons ago by our caveman ances -
tors. Santa thinks twenty-two 
steps ahead because he knows 
normal people’s strategies. /T_he 
whole “chimney entrance” is a ru -
mor he started spreading to throw 
people oﬀ his trail and hide his 
secrets. But the vents are the last 
place anyone expects Santa to ap -
pear, so that’s where he’ll be, and that’s where we’ll strike.
Coating nets with lavender 
oil is the next step. Lavender oil 
contains linalool, a chemical that, 
when inhaled, is rapidly absorbed 
into the bloodstream and induces 
sleepiness. Santa’s vision will be 
obscured by darkness, and then 
BAM! He’s ensnared in a net and 
lulled to sleep. Y our /f_irst instinct 
may be to question the eﬀective -
ness of lavender oil — a substance 
with a distinct smell. Surely, San -ta will recognize the scent, and 
surely, his eyes have adjusted to 
the darkness through centuries on 
the job. And to that, I say, you are 
100% right.
/T_he beauty of this trap is its de -
ceptiveness. /T_he trap is meant to 
lower Santa’s guard and make him 
think he has foiled your plans. 
However, it’s just good enough to 
convince Santa that it’s not a dum -
my trap. It’s the perfect bait. Santa 
will surely dispose of the trap and prioritize one stop above all else: 
the plate of cookies. Now, the real 
plan begins. Y ou have included 
a secret ingredient in the cook -
ies that is known to contain high 
amounts of melatonin: walnuts. 
With this chemical, Santa will be 
out cold, and you will have your 
curiosity satis/f_ied. 
Now you may be wondering, 
“Viggo, have you ever seen Santa 
Claus using this plan?” Of course, 
I have! He looked just like how I thought he would. I remember 
hearing a distinct thud and dash -
ing out of my bed. /T_he fabric of 
his suit was unlike anything I had 
ever seen before, and the white 
ball on his cap looked as /f_luﬀy as 
a bunny’s tail. It’s a little weird be -
cause my parents said they were 
awake and didn’t hear a sound, but 
I swear I saw him!

My Experience with Greek Life at UCSD
By MEHAK SAHOTA
/gid00020/gid00021/gid00002/gid00007/gid00007/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
As my second Fall Quarter at 
UC San Diego draws to a close, 
I have been taking some time to 
re/f_lect on last year’s Fall Quarter. 
One of the main experiences that 
characterized my Fall Quarter as 
a freshman was joining a sorority, 
despite Greek life being the last 
thing I had expected for myself 
before I came to UCSD. 
/T_he summer before our fresh -
man year of college, I remem -
ber my best friend asking me if I 
planned on rushing in the fall. I 
was shocked that she thought I’ d 
even be considering it. I didn’t 
know much about sororities, but 
what I imagined was a toxic en -
vironment /f_illed with super/f_icial 
and hateful people. I thought 
Greek life would not be a space 
where I could be myself or make 
meaningful connections. I was 
worried I would feel the need to 
conform in order to /f_it in — the 
same way I felt throughout much 
of my early teenage years; there -
fore, I planned to steer clear of 
anything that could remotely 
make me feel the same way.
However, my freshman year 
started oﬀ much rougher than I 
was expecting. I was hit with the 
harsh reality of moving away from 
home as a girl who had never 
spent more than two weeks away 
from her family. Coming from 
a small town and a high school 
with a graduating class of 150, 
adjusting to a university of thou -
sands and being nine hours away 
from home proved to be diﬃcult. 
I felt very alone and missed the 
relationships I le/f_t behind. I then 
began to reevaluate my attitude 
towards Greek life a/f_ter hearing from my suitemates and friends 
at other schools about their expe -
riences. I decided to go through 
recruitment, and I was pleasantly 
surprised. 
I found that most sororities at 
UCSD were diverse and /f_illed with 
ambitious students who I shared 
similar interests and values with. 
Much to my surprise, all the girls 
I met throughout recruitment 
were friendly and welcoming. I 
immediately felt like I was sur -
rounded by so many people like 
me, while also having completely 
diﬀerent backgrounds. I feel very 
lucky to go to a university where 
I’m constantly surrounded by oth -
er people of color, many of them 
/f_irst-generation college students like myself, knowing that we are 
sharing the same experiences, and 
the sorority I joined emulated this. 
On the other hand, it is also 
important to recognize that this 
experience is not consistent with 
the institution of Greek life at 
other schools, especially at big -
ger state schools. /T_he warm and 
welcoming atmosphere of Pan -
hellenic at UCSD is an exception 
rather than the standard. Many of 
my friends and I agree that if we 
were at another school, we prob -
ably would not be in Greek life, 
due to the toxic environment and 
negative stereotypes it can per -
petuate. /T_his is something I have 
spent a lot of time thinking about, 
and it does sometimes /f_ill me with guilt. At what point is it hypocriti -
cal to criticize a system when you 
are actively a part of it? Is there 
room for improvement in an in -
stitution like this? /T_hese questions 
/f_ill my mind when I question my 
place in Greek life and think about 
whether or not being in a sorority 
is for me. 
Despite this, the women I have 
met through my sorority are in -
credibly important to me. /T_hey 
are kind, upli/f_ting, and supportive 
in all respects. I have been pushed 
to step out of my comfort zone in 
ways that have had an immeasur -
able impact on my con/f_idence. 
I am constantly inspired by the 
work ethic of the women around 
me who juggle work, sorority life, extracurricular commitments, 
school, and career opportunities. I 
feel as though I am always pushed 
to be the best version of myself 
with the most wonderful group of 
friends surrounding me. 
/T_his is not to say that Greek 
life does not require reform, as 
it absolutely does. As a start, I 
think Sorority & Fraternity Life 
at UCSD has done a great job at 
acknowledging the need for edu -
cation on important issues that 
come up within Greek life such as 
microaggressions, mental health 
struggles, misogyny, along with 
others. Implementing workshops 
and peer-led discussions on im -
portant topics instead of brushing 
them under the rug is incredibly 
important, but there is only so 
much that can be done when our 
society upholds harmful beauty 
standards and continues to be 
discriminatory and sustain racial 
divisions. 
Nonetheless, Greek life has 
shaped my college experience in 
ways I did not expect. Staying true 
to my identity and being someone 
worthy of the sacri/f_ices my immi -
grant parents made to send me to 
college is always my number one 
priority. I feel proud that I am able 
to accomplish this while being a 
part of my sorority, even though 
there are issues that initially made 
me question joining Greek life. My 
sorority has provided me with a 
community of individuals who are 
unique, caring, and hardworking 
in ways I look up to that ultimately 
make me glad my freshman year 
self decided to go through recruit -
ment.

World Cup 2022: To Be Remembered For All the Wrong 
Reasons?
Tritons Snap Two Game Losing Streak Behind Bryce 
Pope’s Career Night
/T_he World Cup is the iconic 
and legendary international foot -
ball tournament intended to bring 
the world together through sport; 
it promotes international friend -
ship and unity for both its partici -
pants and its audience. We’re now 
a week in, and there’s a lot to talk 
about. 
/T_he group stages have kicked 
oﬀ and so have the headlines, from 
shock upsets like Argentina’s loss 
to the much lower-ranked Saudi 
Arabia, to Qatar’s group stage dis -
quali/f_ication — the earliest a host 
nation has exited the tournament 
in its history. Unfortunately, these 
matches are overshadowed by the 
controversy that has surrounded 
the tournament since Qatar was 
announced in 2010. I wish I could 
use this opportunity to write a 
full preview of the next month of 
football, tell you my predictions 
for which teams I think will suc -
ceed, and who I think will raise 
the trophy at the end of it all. But 
I cannot in good conscience do 
that, because this is an event of 
corruption and pain that needs to 
be treated as such. 
Qatar’s selection, and sub -
sequent preparation to host the 
event, has been mired in scandal 
and controversy. Among oth -
ers, some of the main concerns 
expressed by the tournament’s 
critics are the small oil nation’s 
dismal human rights record, its 
inhumane treatment of migrant 
labor workers, and its laws which 
persecute the LGBTQ communi -
ty. Detractors of the tournament 
include the public, international 
human rights organizations like 
Amnesty International, and par -By EMER Nolan
/gid00008/gid00022/gid00006/gid00020/gid00021/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019ticipating teams themselves. One 
of the most outspoken of these 
teams is Denmark, which has 
been one of the most vocal protes -
tors of the injustices committed 
by Qatar. In a collaboration with 
kit manufacturer Hummel, head -
ing into the tournament, the Dan -
ish national team will be out/f_itted 
in either their all-red or all-black 
kits, the former representing their 
desire to be invisible  “during a 
tournament that has cost thou -
sands of people their lives, ” and 
the latter as a mourning out/f_it for 
the lives that have been lost.
Now that the tournament has 
begun, the outcries over its cir -
cumstances have far from waned, 
in large part due to Federation 
Internationale de Football As -
sociation’s doubling down. In a 
decision that only poured fuel on 
the /f_ire, football’s international 
governing body announced their 
decision to punish team captains 
with automatic yellow cards if 
they decided to wear the OneLove 
armbands in protest of the Qa -
tari legal ban on homosexual -
ity. Forced into a corner, England, 
Wales, Belgium, Denmark, Ger -
many, and the Netherlands then 
made the announcement that they 
would abandon the statement, and 
subsequently, the German nation -
al team took a photograph before 
their group stage tie with Japan 
on Wednesday with their hands 
covering their mouths, protesting 
their forced silence.
/T_his World Cup is undeni -
ably tainted. /T_here is no way to 
fully enjoy the event without 
this shadow lurking in the back -
ground. /T_he players themselves 
are put in a most uncomfortable 
and confusing position. /T_he me -
dia looks to them to condemn the 
hosts and take a stand against the injustices and controversy sur -
rounding Qatar, but the players 
just want to play, and for good 
reason. /T_hey were not the ones 
who made the corrupt decision to 
choose Qatar as the host nation 12 
years ago, nor should they be put 
under such pressure to speak out 
about it. Playing in the World Cup 
for your country is the highest 
honor a player can be given, and 
footballers aspire to these heights 
from childhood. Most of them 
just want to play and make their 
nations proud. It is unfair that 
the pressure to speak out weighs 
so heavily on players, so we must 
commend them and the teams 
that choose to take a stand with 
the platform the tournament has given them.
On a personal note, I feel con -
/f_licted on whether I should watch 
due to the ethical implications of 
supporting Qatar in any way, and 
I’m not the only one in this posi -
tion. Fans all over the world are 
in a similar position of wanting 
to support their national teams or 
their favorite players but being un -
willing to support the tournament 
itself. It is wrong that this burden 
has been placed on the audience. 
Similar to the players, we had no 
hand in awarding Qatar hosting 
duties nor their cruel and inhu -
mane way of attaining them. We, 
as consumers, being positioned to 
bear any part of the blame just by 
watching is wrong. To fans of the game, the World Cup is the great -
est celebration of football around 
the globe. We look forward to 
the tournament and every 4 years 
when it rolls around, it’s all the 
world can talk about. Children fall 
in love with the game by watch -
ing the World Cup. Fans (read: 
myself) remember Mario Goetze’s 
last-minute winner that clinched 
the trophy for Germany in 2014 
more clearly than they remember 
what they had for breakfast yes -
terday. International tournaments 
like the World Cup and the Olym -
pics are meant to be beacons of 
positivity, global celebration, and 
human togetherness, but, in 2022, 
that purpose has been poisoned.

Last Tuesday, UC San Diego 
men’s basketball (2–4, 0–0 Big 
West) took on George Washington 
University (3–2, 0–0 Atlantic 10 
Conference) in the nation’s capital 
just before the holiday weekend. 
/T_he Tritons entered the contest 
looking to get back in the win col -
umn following an overtime loss 
to the U.S. Naval Academy and a 
blowout loss to Y oungstown State 
University. /T_he Colonials, on the 
other hand, had gotten oﬀ to quite 
a strong start this season and en -
tered Tuesday’s game looking to 
attain a perfect 5–0 home record. 
/T_he /f_irst half kicked oﬀ with 
some neck-and-neck play on the 
oﬀensive end, with the Tritons 
leading 10–9 with 13:20 remain -
ing in the half. UCSD then got into 
an oﬀensive rhythm by stringing 
together a couple of made 3-point 
/f_ield goals from their freshman 
guard Roddie Anderson III and 
their redshirt junior forward Jake 
Kosakowski. /T_he story of the 
night, however, was once again 
the play of redshirt junior guard 
Bryce Pope, who has played the 
role of the hero for the Tritons so 
far this season. 
Pope /f_inished the /f_irst half 
with 15 points, including three 
3-pointers, and was the spark the 
Tritons needed to rally behind to 
take a commanding lead in the 
/f_irst half. Two of Pope’s 3-point -ers, along with a converted layup 
from Pope, ballooned the lead for 
the Tritons as they took control of 
the game with under two minutes 
le/f_t. With several forced turnovers 
and well-rounded team perfor -
mance, the Tritons put together 
their best half of the season thus 
far, as they led by 16 and entered 
hal/f_time up 41–25. 
In the second half, the Tritons 
picked up where they le/f_t oﬀ and 
maintained about the same /f_if -
teen-point advantage. Pope con -tinued his eﬃcient shooting from 
the /f_ield and was able to score 
an additional 16 points. UCSD 
also saw more scoring contribu -
tions from redshirt junior guard 
Jace Roquemore, senior forward 
J’Raan Brooks, and redshirt junior 
center Emmanuel Tshimanga. 
However, despite leading by 13 
from a 3-pointer by Roquemore 
with 6:18 remaining on the clock, 
the Tritons found themselves in a 
brand new game down the stretch.
UCSD was unable to continue their strong /f_irst-half defense and 
began to put the Colonials on the 
free-throw line each time down 
the /f_loor. /T_he Triton perimeter at -
tack stalled out a little toward the 
end, but they continued to score 
just enough to hold oﬀ GWU 
from taking the lead. /T_he Co -
lonials clawed back to cut their 
de/f_icit down to 2 with 20 seconds 
remaining in the game. /T_he Co -
lonials displayed a valiant eﬀort 
in crunch time, but the Tritons 
came away victorious as they were able to hold on until the end. Pope 
iced the game with two clutch free 
throws at the last second of regula -
tion, leading his team to a 75–70 
win and ultimately snapping a 
two-game losing streak. 
UCSD had a very eﬃcient 
game shooting the ball, going 
51.9% from the /f_ield and 47.1% 
from the three-point range. Pope 
was once again his team’s player 
of the game, /f_inishing with an 
NBA 2K-like stat line of 31 points 
on 11–16 shooting and 3–5 from 
beyond the arc, while also being 
the only player on his team in 
double /f_igures. /T_he Colonials had 
three players in double /f_igures, 
including James Bishop IV with 
25 points, Brendan Adams with 
20 points, and Maximus Edwards 
with 10 points. GWU’s biggest 
fault in the game was their three-
point shooting, as the Triton pe -
rimeter defense forced them to 
shoot only 28% from the perim -
eter. Despite UCSD having a bad 
day from the free throw line, the 
Tritons were able to capitalize 
from the line in crunch time and 
match the Colonials in free throws 
made, going 11–21 while GWU 
went 11–15 from the line.
On /T_hursday, Dec. 1, the Tri -
