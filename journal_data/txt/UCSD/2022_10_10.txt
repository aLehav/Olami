Following a record-breaking number of ad -
missions in Fall 2021, UC San Diego has 
cut back on new student admissions for 
the incoming class of 2022. UCSD extended ad -
missions offers to 42,427 first-year and transfer 
applicants this fall, a decrease of 10,609 from last 
year’s total. 
According to Jim Rawlins, associate vice 
chancellor for enrollment management, UCSD 
Admissions reduced enrollment with the goal of 
strictly capping the amount of students who en -
roll. “The number of offers of admission are al -
ways driven by predictions of how many students 
will accept our offer, and it was important that 
we not exceed our enrollment goals this year. For 
that reason, we were more cautious in making of -
fers this year,” Rawlins said. 
The reduction of admissions has come despite 
continuous increases in applications. “It
is difficult to predict future trends,” Rawl -
ins noted, “[but] the historical data has shown 
a steady increase in applications year over year.” 
UCSD received 131,226 first-year applications 
in 2022, up from 118,360 in 2021 and 100,034 in 
2020, the increase reflecting increased accessi -
bility of the UC application.
“The one application used for all UC campus -
es contributes to the ease of applying. In addi -
tion, switching to a test-free approach to admis -
sion has empowered more students to feel more 
confident in applying to UCs,” elaborated Raw -
lins. 
As a result of the reductions in admissions, 
there has been a corresponding decrease in total 
enrollment, although the official data won't be 
released until “ the coming weeks [...] in coopera -
tion with the UC Office of the President on their 
established timeline,” according to Rawlins. 
Enrollment reductions arrive as UCSD con -
tinues to construct several large-scale housing 
projects, such as the Theater District and Pepper 
Canyon West Living Learning Neighborhoods, in an attempt to meet administration goals. 
“Starting in 2023, three new on-campus 
housing neighborhoods will open in successive 
years, adding more than 5,000 new undergradu -
ate beds on campus by 2025,” said Associate 
Director of University Communications, Leslie 
Sepuka. 
She added that “the university’s goal is to 
house 50% of all students by 2025 and to contin -
ue making progress toward a four-year housing 
guarantee at below market rates.”
According to Associate Director of Universi -
ty Communications Erika Johnson, the decrease 
in admissions and enrollment was expected by 
campus planners.
“This decrease was the foundation of a suc -
cessful effort to ensure we did not exceed enroll -
ment targets for the year. We anticipate the same 
careful approach to enrollment goals in future 
years,” Johnson said. 
Despite increasing on-campus housing ca -
pacity, the under-construction housing projects 
will not affect UCSD’s enrollment targets. In -
stead, Johnson stated that the enrollment targets 
will continue to be developed by a collaboration 
between both campus and UC system-wide of -
ficials. 
According to Rawlins, “Campus specific en -
rollment goals are tied to system-wide enroll -
ment goals [...] focused on how many students 
will enroll, and in regard to the funding they 
can offer toward California residents. Decisions 
on how many students to offer admission [...] is 
determined at the campus level.”
Whether or not UCSD will maintain its ex -
isting admissions and enrollment targets is yet 
to be determined by officials. However, Rawlins 
did note that “further reductions are not likely,” 
and that further changes will be based on the 
number of students who accept their offer of ad -
mission. Cutting Back: UCSD Reduces Incoming

Year Housing Guarantee, 
Student-Alumni 
Mentorship Program
At their Week 2 meeting on 
Oct. 5, A.S. Council heard special 
presentations from the alumni 
board and discussed resolutions 
for a four-year housing guaran -
tee as well as revisions to the A.S. 
constitution regarding the powers 
of the Executive Vice President.
/T_he meeting began with a 
student giving public input urg -
ing senators to vote against an 
upcoming constitutional change 
that would allow the Executive 
Vice President to share their opin -
ion on matters a/f_ter a debate has 
been brought to a close and there 
are no other speakers. /T_he student 
warned that the change could tip 
the balance between the branches 
of the student government.
Next, senators heard a special 
presentation from the UC San 
Diego Alumni board on UCSD 
Alumni Student Engagement 
Program, a mentorship program 
available to all UCSD students 
that pairs students with an alum -
ni mentor. /T_he presenters encour -
aged A.S. senators to partake in 
the program to better serve their 
roles in student government, al -
though the conversations do not 
have to be Associated Students 
speci/f_ic. Sign-ups for the program 
are due by Nov. 4 for all students.
Following the presentation, 
the senators took a /f_ive minute re -
cess. A/f_ter which, the microphone 
was muted for approximately 20 
minutes while they discussed on -
going projects. 
/T_hey then moved on to dis -
cuss the constitutional change 
mentioned earlier during public 
input on expanding the powers of 
the Executive Vice President, and, 
a/f_ter discussion, they voted not to 
amend the constitution.
For the remainder of the 
meeting, senators discussed a 
resolution for a four-year hous -
ing guarantee. During a tense 
two hour discussion, the senators 
went back and forth on the eﬀects 
of the resolution. While some 
believed the resolution is urgent 
and should be passed so that A.S. 
President Sky Yang could bring 
up the matter in his future meet -
ing with UC President Michael V. 
Drake, others believed that there 
was no need to pass the resolu -
tion as it would not result in any 
university action and acts only as 
a statement of support.
A/f_ter much deliberation the 
senators took a roll call vote and 
passed the four-year housing 
guarantee resolution, a/f_ter which 
the meeting was adjourned.

Triples are Better Than Singles
For dorm rooms, triples are 
better than singles. Triples of -
fer opportunities for cultural ex -
change, learning to get along with 
people, making friends, and are 
more aﬀordable and accessible.
I’m a third-year student living 
in a triple in Blake Hall, and I’m 
grateful for it all: not only that I 
got on-campus housing, but that 
UC San Diego Housing Dining 
Hospitality (HDH) decided to 
give me a triple in a residential 
hall. /T_his surprised me at /f_irst, but 
I thought “might as well make up 
for what Zoom university took 
from me. ”
/T_he result: I’m gradually learn -
ing Spanish and Russian. I also 
/f_ind joy in teaching my room -
mates Japanese. I got interested 
in the various states of India and 
their diasporas in the United 
States. I talked with Chinese stu -
dents and learned about their ex -periences and perspectives while 
sharing with them mine. All in my 
free time, when I might’ve other -
wise been browsing random Y ou -
Tube videos.
/T_he special thing about triples 
is that it positively molds your 
personality to be more /f_lexible, 
and social. Introversion isn’t in -
herently a weakness, but extrover -
sion has its advantages, and even 
introverts can and should learn to 
be social because it extends one’s 
network and knowledge. In a tri -
ple, you have people who may do 
things you were always too shy to 
do, like perhaps singing. But once 
you hear them doing it, you might 
think something like, “Regardless 
of how bad or good they sing, I 
don’t judge their entire character 
based on that. /T_hen why should 
I be worried that others will do 
the same to me?” And once that 
clicks, you’ll be a lot more open to 
try many things.
Another thing is that while in a 
triple, I’ve been a lot more courte -
ous. Being in a triple teaches you to think about other people which 
is an important skill to have, espe -
cially if you want to get married, 
or just make friends. People who 
used to not wash their hands af -
ter the restroom started washing 
their hands. Triples may also keep 
people from strewing trash all 
over their room or staying up late 
way past what is healthy for them 
because of the social pressure 
from roommates. One may argue 
that this pressure is bad because 
it forces people to conform to the 
social norm. However, not all so -
cial norms are unreasonable, and 
conforming to the rational norms 
such as maintaining personal hy -
giene would be a good thing for 
both the individual and society.
On the other hand, triples do 
bring up health concerns. How -
ever, these concerns are not as sig -
ni/f_icant as one would think. /T_hink 
of all the other times you might 
put yourself at risk of getting CO -
VID-19. When you eat lunch with 
friends and take oﬀ your masks 
while talking face-to-face with each other, you increase your 
chances of getting COVID. When 
you ride the bus or the Geisel ele -
vator, although the exposure time 
is shorter, you’re packed at a densi -
ty perhaps 10 times that of a triple. 
Not to mention you’re riding with 
strangers, which makes it harder 
to know whether they’ve been ex -
posed to COVID or perhaps are 
asymptomatic. My point is that 
given how most people I observe 
carry out their daily lives, I don’t 
think living in a triple would sig -
ni/f_icantly increase your chances of 
getting COVID or monkeypox as 
long as you don’t share towels or 
beds.
While some may /f_ind it annoy -
ing or even oﬀensive to live with 
people who are diﬀerent, I would 
argue that triples are a way to 
teach us to work around our dif -
ferences and /f_ind ways to connect 
with each other, making these an -
noying feelings akin to the feelings 
an elementary schooler may have 
towards homework. Maybe I’m 
just lucky enough not to have met BY BENJAMIN LIOU

the “roommate from hell, ” but I’ve 
found that most people at UCSD 
are reasonable to communicate 
with. A/f_ter all, the advantage of 
going to a university is that all 
the people admitted should have 
passed through a rigorous selec -
tion process, ensuring quality in 
character, thus allowing us to safe -
ly open up to each other. We can 
learn and teach more eﬃciently 
without having to worry about be -
ing judged or harmed.
Finally, there’s the cost aspect. 
Many college students can’t aﬀord 
to spend extra money on housing 
nor extra time on hour-long com -
mutes and /f_inding parking. Triples 
allow more students to receive af -
fordable and accessible on-cam -
pus housing by simply increasing 
density. /T_his cost reduction, along 
with the additional bene/f_its of cul -
tural exchange, social skills, and 
friendship make triple dorms the 
bargain deal. Maybe we should 
even extend it to four-person 
rooms or above./gid00042/gid00076/gid00064/gid00070/gid00068/gid00001/gid00066/gid00078/gid00084/gid00081/gid00083/gid00068/gid00082/gid00088/gid00001/gid00078/gid00069/gid00001/gid00054/gid00077/gid00082/gid00079/gid00075/gid00064/gid00082/gid00071/gid000154 THE UCSD GUARDIAN | MONDAY , OCTOBER 10, 2022 | WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG  EDITORIAL

FROM THE EDITOR:  It was UCSD’s /f_irst decade and 
the height of political tensions in the 1960s. /T_he UC Re -
gents attempted to centralize academic authority across 
the UC with themselves. When Ronald Reagan arrived for 
the Regents meeting at UCSD, the student body met him 
with dead silence. Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver spoke on 
campus weeks before he /f_led to Cuba. Alum Angela Davis 
helped advocate for a radical Lumumba-Zapata College, a 
movement that, while it ultimately failed, resulted in stu -
dent occupation of the Oﬃce of the Registrar. Students 
fought for reappointment of “Father of the New Le/f_t, ” Her -
bert Marcuse, a professor with the department of philoso -
phy. And amidst it all, UCSD played seven games of me -
diocre college football. Here are a few news clippings from 
/T_he Guardian as it was formerly known: /T_he Triton Times. 
Enjoy them. Or don’t! It’s up to you.

EUNICE KIM AND OISHEE MISRA  
A young man may wake up 
early for their usual morning shi/f_t. 
He might wash up and bid their 
grandparents goodbye but not be -
fore asking if they would need any -
thing before he leaves. He might 
not be able to pay rent yet, but he 
oﬀers them a kind of company and 
security no senior living home can 
quite emulate. He was raised in the 
home, went oﬀ to college, and later 
returned. /T_his story is one that is 
beginning to rise in popularity — 
and decrease in stigma.
Many Generation Z folks have 
begun to move back in, from their 
own places or college, with their 
parents and grandparents. /T_here 
is evidently the bene/f_it of saving 
on rent, which is not a new occur -
rence as rent is only on the rise.
In a Zillow study from the sum -
mer of 2020, an increase of 9.7% 
from 2019 to 2020 saw more than 
32 million adults living with a par -
ent or grandparent. /T_his does still 
acknowledge that many college 
students have returned home due 
to the nationwide closure of col -
lege campuses during COVID-19, 
but also states that increases in un -
employment have made it diﬃcult 
to bridge the gap between earnings 
and rent costs.
But something is diﬀerent here 
in regards to coming back home 
to folks from older generations, 
particularly grandparents. /T_here is 
o/f_ten a lack of exact duration Gen 
Z folks wish to stay with them for. 
/T_here is also a sense of familiarity 
in how many of these familial, af -
fectionate hands that once helped 
raise these Gen Z individuals in 
their youth are now also being the 
ones who are aided. 
A/f_ter all, elderly individuals are 
increasingly susceptible to diseas -
es, particularly cognitive ones like 
dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, 
which will only increase by more 
than two-fold to aﬀect almost 13 
million Americans by 2050. /T_he 
prevalence, in fact, of the disease 
increases with age and factors such as minimal exercise and low in -
come, with the added impact of 
there being no cure. 
Furthermore, due to the lack 
of resources back at home with 
their own children, many elderly 
folks go oﬀ to senior care homes 
in the U.S., where many indi -
viduals with dementia pass away 
alone. It is no surprise, too, that 
these facilities are not univer -
sally loved. For them to be ideal, 
they are extremely expensive 
and resource-intensive. 
/T_he New Y ork Times notes 
grandchildren living with their 
grandparents in their home as 
“skipped-generation” house -
holds — a time for both vastly 
diﬀerent generations to cohabit 
and help each other with things 
such as understanding phones 
and oﬀsetting immense rent 
costs, as well as doing manicures 
together to occupy their time. 
Now, the children that were once 
wobbling on their feet in their 
youth are in a quasi-symbiotic 
relationship with their grand -
parents without any parental in -
volvement. 
However, the diﬀerence be -
tween the two generations here 
lies in how grandparents are 
settled in their home, while the 
young adults are choosing to 
nestle in their nest. Still, these 
Gen Z individuals have more 
autonomy than they did dur -
ing youth and if they did have 
parents that helped raise them 
growing up, their grandparents 
may be less inclined to lecturing 
them or being as authoritative 
with their jobs or other activi -
ties. 
If  the grandparents are the 
main caretakers because the 
parent(s) could not be, this is a 
skipped-generation household. 
Opposite, when three genera -
tions of the family are present, 
this is called the “three-gener -
ation” household. While both 
types of households may strug -gle with problems from alcohol -
ism to divorce, grandparents in 
the former household are more 
likely to struggle with physical 
disabilities and chronic health 
issues along with /f_inancial is -
sues. Additionally, in the former 
household, grandparents may 
feel a heightened sense of obliga -
tion for the grandchildren if they 
were the sole caretakers of them 
growing up. /T_his highlights how 
familial dynamics vary based on 
who was most participative or re -
sponsible in the family.
However, elderly individu -
als may feel more cared for and 
less lonely when they can con -
verse with the youngsters in 
their home. /T_he young adults 
can advocate for their grandpar -
ents, such as running errands or 
translating for them if there is a 
language barrier. According to a 
source from the Journal of Fam -
ily Issues, author Sharon Boland 
Hamill details that Alzheimer’s 
disease, for one, can decrease au -
tonomy and one’s control which 
means that the grandchildren 
have more formal and informal 
obligations they can take on de -
pending on the role their parents 
assume. 
While the concept of “living 
in mom’s basement” is seen as 
lowly and even almost pathetic 
for many young adults feeling 
the pressure to leave their nests, 
artist Mark Erickson focuses 
on architecture to state that the 
housing models such as single-
family homes are the norm in 
North America and other coun -
tries aren’t quite designed like 
this. In the TedTalk on multigen -
erational living, Erickson delves 
into how elders in Gambia are 
revered and honored to the high -
est degree. /T_hey live together with 
multiple generations of the fam -
ily, while elders aren’t regarded as 
well here in North America. /T_hey 
can be cast, for instance, to the 
sidelines in senior care facilities. /T_he two speakers, Mark Er -
ickson and Matthew Kennedy, go 
on to state that laneway houses 
— or mother-in-law units — are 
ideal as they prioritize interde -
pendence over independence. 
/T_here is enough proximity be -
tween units for diﬀerent genera -
tions of the family to claim their 
own space in separate rooms and 
come together in situations such 
as dinner or the need for assis -
tance. 
/T_his is an example of main -
taining one’s own space and still 
engaging with family when able 
to do so. 
But this story of cohabitation 
is perhaps easier for those with 
established relationships and af -
fections with their grandparents, 
like when it comes to taking care 
of those with Alzheimer’s. /T_hose 
who do not have close ties with 
their grandparents may struggle 
with bonding or sharing com -
mon interests. For instance, when 
grandparents formally adopt 
their children’s kids or infor -
mally care for them because the 
parent(s) is incapable of doing so, 
this responsibility may come with 
a sense of guilt and/or depression.
But if there is a desire for both 
parties to know each other more 
or at least be respectful “room -
mates, ” the end result is an oppor -
tunity for widely diﬀerent genera -
tions to coincide in camaraderie. 
For many individuals, return -
ing home is not necessarily out of 
just desire to stay but due to the 
rising costs in living. /T_his does 
pave an opportunity for one to be 
purposeful with both their time 
and their grandparent’s time. 
One might see remnants of their 
impact in framed photos in the 
childhood home: a stark marker 
of how they grew up in their 
youth. /T_his can bridge the gap 
between two widely separate gen -
erations, in the way they converse 
and tell stories or just sit with 
each other.
Not Forgetting The Childhood Home
Generation Z folks are moving back home more than ever, and not just relishing the /f_inancial perks. /T_he return can pave diﬀerences in the way grandparents of the home interact with the young folk — many of whom they grew up

Is it possible to feel like a deer in headlights amidst a crowd of 4,600? Rosalía’s bold entrance 
to her sold out show at the CalCoast Credit Union Open Air /T_heatre seemed to have that 
eﬀect. When the stadium lights began to dim at precisely 9:05 p.m., the stage /f_illed with 
sporadic strobe lights designed to mimic headlights. Deep, growling engine noises echoed 
through the audience. 
/T_he audience was entranced, literal deer in headlights as their eyes darted from le/f_t to right. 
Dancers began to move onto the stage in a rectangular formation as the revved engine 
noises began to multiply, torsos bent over and arms dangling to the /f_loor as they assumed 
form as a human car. /T_he lights began to pulse, and the engine sounds started to blur with 
the electric instrumentals of Rosalía’s hit single “Saoko” as Rosalía emerged from the middle 
of the human car. /T_he crowd began to scream. 
Sunday’s show marked Rosalía’s debut performance in San Diego. She played a full two-
hour show with no opening act and very few breaks, a testament to the years she devoted to 
perfecting her cra/f_t. A graduate of the prestigious Catalonia College of Music in Barcelona, 
Rosalía spent eight years studying /f_lamenco and music production while training under 
decorated musicians. 
Despite facing criticism over her heavy use of /f_lamenco in/f_luences, her most recent project 
“Motomami” earned an 8.4 Pitchfork rating and garnered the attention of Cardi B and Tyler Review: Motomami T our 
the Creator. /T_he album, while still rooted in /f_lamenco, melds in/f_luences of reggaeton, pop, 
and hip-hop, and features artists such as the Weeknd and Pharell Williams.  
Rosalía played the entirety of “Motomami” during her 31-song set, in addition to fan favor -
ites like “Malamente” and “Con Altura” that helped launch her to global fame right before 
the pandemic, and a selection of covers including “Blinding Lights” by the Weeknd.
Her audience was a sea of leather pants, sheer blouses, and platform boots, the heart of the 
edgy yet feminine aesthetic that arose from the album. Some sang along to every word with 
her while others stood in awe, mouths gaping open. Regardless of if you could speak Span -
ish /f_luently or could only pick up a few words, the passion and emotion dripping from her 
voice were evident.   
/T_here was absolutely nothing static about the show. From the contemporary choreography 
to Rosalías own dancing and facial expressions, it was hard to look away from the stage. 
Even the camera work broke from traditional molds, with a cameraman following Rosalía 
around onstage and broadcasting that footage to large screens at the sides of the stage. At 
one point, Rosalía grabbed the camera and sang into it before passing it around to the danc -
ers. 
/T_he set was a white screen for a majority of the show and, aside from Rosalía and a handful 
of dancers, there was nothing else on the main stage. Such simplicity allowed the audience 
to focus on the raw vocal talent at hand as she /f_lickered eﬀortlessly between high energy 
tracks and soulful power ballads that brought tears to her eyes. 
Her moments of solitude on stage had a similar impact. From her performance of the self-
re/f_lective “DIABLO, ” during which she cut the braids out of her hair and wiped oﬀ her 
makeup, to her performances of “Dolerme” and “HENTAI” during which she was alone on 
stage with her instrument, these moments were thoughtfully chosen.
For such a long set, the show was surprisingly engaging. Rosalía brought groups of fans 
onstage to dance with her during the upbeat tracks “Y o x ti, tú x mí” and “DESPECHÁ, ” 
and even ran into the audience during “LA NOCHE DE ANOCHE, ” holding her mic up for 
lucky audience members to sing the verses with her.   
During the middle of the show, fans started throwing piles of Dr. Simi stuﬀed toys on the 
stage, sending Rosalía on a wild goose chase around the stage trying to scoop them all up. It 
has become a trend in Mexico for fans to throw Dr. Simi, the mascot of a popular drugstore 
chain in Mexico, toys to singers at concerts. Seeing as San Diego is so close to the border, it 
seems to have caught on.  
Despite being hit square in the face by a bouquet of /f_lowers that a fan /f_lung onto the stage 
at the end of “Con Altura, ” she still rode back out on a scooter for a three song encore that 
ended with “Motomami” track “CUUUUuuuuuute. ” A solid representation of the cathartic 
soundscape of the album, the song slams back and forth between chaos and calm, old and 
new, rigid and so/f_t, much like the nature of her artistry.

While most might see a show about pirates on the surface, a deeper dive shows that “Our 
Flag Means Death '' is more about the rede/f_ining of masculinity, and is a refreshing take on 
the type of LGTBQ stories present in modern media.
“Our Flag Means Death,” known endearingly as “the gay pirate show,” instantly capti -
vated viewers with its lighthearted premise and emotional progression that leaves the au -
dience distraught at its end. A/f_ter the /f_inal episode, I was sobbing on the couch, wondering 
how I came to care so much about middle-aged men living in the 18th century.  
/T_he show is driven by the o/f_f_beat humor and charming awkwardness indicative of ex -
ecutive producer Taika Waititi’s style. While the playful humor takes the foreground, it’s 
the moments of tension that strengthen the connection between the show’s characters and 
viewers. /T_he pilot episode begins with an introduction to a mishmash crew of pirates cap -
tained by Stede Bonnet (Rhys Darby), a well-intended man who le/f_t his aristocratic life for 
piracy. /T_hroughout the show, Stede searches for a sense of belonging at sea that he never 
found in domestic life, and in doing so, creates an uncharacteristically welcoming envi -
ronment on his ship, “/T_he Revenge.” Despite the crew’s doubts on Stede’s competency as a 
pirate and captain, they grow to care for Stede in tandem with the audience. In watching 
Stede’s deep care for his new profession and the people aboard, it feels like second nature 
to root for him.
One of the main themes in “Our Flag Means Death” is the exploration and expression 
of identity. Stede brings on board his /f_lamboyant silk clothes from his past, immediately 
challenging the depictions of pirates. He dubs himself the “Gentleman Pirate” and con -
sistently struggles with the violence expected of piracy, but remains dedicated to his job. 
/T_he crew’s light beige color palette and interest in art, whether music or sewing, is also 
misaligned with the stereotypical images of piracy. “/T_he Revenge’s” overall brightness in -
dicates a warm environment fostered by Stede. As a result, each crew member undergoes a 
journey of self-exploration o/f_ten rooted in the undoing of toxic masculinity, which, in the 
show, can be interchangeable with the understanding of “real” piracy. 
In contrast, every other crew that “/T_he Revenge” encounters is clad in 18th century 
sailor wear or disheveled black attire, which re/f_lects their beliefs on “true piracy” and 
stoicism as central to masculinity. /T_he evolution of understanding one’s relationship to 
masculinity can be tracked by Blackbeard’s (Taika Waititi) costuming. He is introduced 
in a tight black out/f_it, showing oﬀ his de/f_ined arms and chest, with charcoal under his 
eyes. /T_his initial image of Blackbeard re/f_lects the strong reputation he must uphold in 
order to maintain respect from his crew and other pirates. As Blackbeard learns from — 
and begins to love — Stede, he is seen in /f_lowy clothes that indicate his growing comfort 
with himself away from his reputation as a cutthroat pirate, and the ability to subvert the 
expectations people place onto him. 
/T_he plot of the show revolves more pointedly around the crew’s experiences working 
together at sea. But, the more understated discussion of queerness does not detract from 
its importance as a major aspect of the show. /T_he continuous conversation around “real” 
piracy parallels the rigidity of masculinity. /T_he distinctions of being a “real” pirate are 
derived from what it means to be a “real” man, which inherently illustrates homophobic 
beliefs. /T_he show’s depiction of the perpetuation of homophobia is done without explicitly 
showing violence against queer people, serving as a reminder that homophobic behavior 
extends beyond direct violence, and rather, exists in systems of beliefs. Inherently then, 
“Our Flag Means Death” grapples with the roots of homophobia without depicting events 
that can be traumatic for viewers. 
While it is crucial to have media with a focal point on queer experiences, I found com -fort in the seamless integration of queerness into the storyline of “Our Flag Means Death.” 
Subtleties like respecting gender /f_luid pronouns for Jim (Vico Ortiz) who never explicitly 
comes out, body language indicators between Blackbeard and Stede, and the overall ex -
ploration of masculinity and belonging makes for a prominently queer show without using 
queerness as a main selling point. Doing so takes the next step to normalizing queerness 
as an inseparable part of life and reminds viewers that an explanation of one’s identity is 
not owed to anyone. 
LGBTQ stories and coming out should be celebrated in representational media, but it is 
refreshing to watch a show that does not sideline or question queer identities as anything 
other than an unchangeable aspect of the characters. While coming out is an important 
milestone, the process of coming out is rooted in a heteronormative culture and is not 
always needed for individuals to validate their queerness. /T_hrough the gradual growth of 
character relationships, the show puts emphasis on emotions and holistic character rela -
tionships before labels. Examining Queer 
Identity in “Our Flag Means Death”

K-Ming Chang is an expert at employing magical realism as a medium for encapsulating 
the Asian American experience of womanhood, with a frequent emphasis on queerness as 
a compounded force.
K-Ming Chang made waves in the industry with the arrival of her debut novel, “Bes -
tiary,” published in 2020 when she was just 22 years old. “Beastiary” focuses on a queer 
Asian girl navigating mystical events beginning to course through her family as she slowly 
begins to turn into the tiger from a childhood story told by her mother. Chang’s fresh voice 
and take on this subject matter earned her debut a longlisting for the Center for Fiction 
First Novel Prize and the PEN/Faulkner Award. /T_he /f_irst few chapters served as my in -
troduction to Chang and her visceral descriptive style that incorporates elements intense 
enough to make the reader uncomfortable. She utilizes such stark bluntness and couples it 
with images that are both intensely graphic and fantastical. 
“Gods of Want '' is a collection of short stories — some of which have appeared in 
other publications including Nashville Review, Sine /T_heta Magazine, and Sinister Wis -
dom — serving as her second publication. /T_he novel is divided into three parts: Mothers, 
Myths, and Moths, each of which bear her signature /f_inesse of distorting possibility and 
constructing a world in which absurdities are simply a means of experiencing life. /T_here is 
a reason behind this division. /T_he stories that compose Mothers deal with familial ties and 
obligations, the emphasis within Myths is placed on love, and Moths tackles the intercon -
nectedness of spirits, time, and want. /T_hematically, the intersectionality of womanhood, 
Asian American identity, and queerness are all hyperpresent throughout the novel, and 
they are particularly powerful because it is clear that the exploration of these identities 
comes from someone who experiences them /f_irsthand. 
Discussing Chang’s work is drastically diﬀerent than experiencing it. It’s vivid and raw. 
For example, in “Mariela” within Moths, the narrator talks about a young girl from her 
childhood, Mariela, as the two girls grew up intertwined. A/f_ter school one day, they de -
cided to play a game that consisted of naming their favorite bodily feature of the other and 
keeping it for themselves. Mariela chooses the narrator’s eyelashes and the narrator pro -
ceeds to “[close] her /f_ingers on the fringe of [her] lashes and [tugs] until it tore away, [her] 
eye lining itself in blood.” Chang doubles down on the tension when the narrator chooses 
Mariela’s teeth. Images like this are a constant for Chang; nobody else seems to consoli -
date intensity like her, and nobody seems to run with /f_iction in the way that she does.
Chang has received a fair amount of criticism for her writing style which appears to 
be /f_luid rather than solid. Lacking a particular focus and instead constantly shi/f_ting, her 
writing style can become an issue when readers attempt to attach themselves to her char -
acters. Personally, this criticism does not resonate with me because I applaud Chang’s 
success in undermining conventional standards. It serves as a reminder that art has no 
form and can exist in malleable spaces. Digesting a story in its entirety is also a necessity 
for “Gods of Want,” as the journey sways and bends but arrives holistically at its end, fully 
formed with the emotional weight Chang means to express. My critique of Chang diﬀers 
from the ones I have most commonly seen; instead, I take note of her portrayal of immi -
grant parents. 
Many of the stories within the novel involve characters and their relationship with 
their parents, most prominently mothers and daughters. Chang beautifully encapsulates 
what it means to be a daughter: the pain, desire, and strength that they are born knowing. 
It is a complicated relationship, a dichotomy of individuals burdened and gi/f_ted with the 
boundless perception of one other. However, I frequently found that she portrays mothers and elders in an almost animalistic way. /T_heir superstitions are so incredibly extreme that 
they seem inhuman. While I understand this serves a purpose in portraying the mythical 
elements of the Asian experience, it also can also paint superstition in a poor light and 
make these people creatures instead of humans. ‘Mariela’ displays some of this imagery 
in which Mariela once found her mother scooping her cremated brother into her mouth 
from oﬀ of their bathroom /f_loor. It’s a visceral display of grief — and part of what makes 
Chang’s work so enticing — but I think there’s a claim to be made about the negative eﬀect 
these images can hold, especially when portraying people of color. 
 Chang’s work, however, ultimately does more good than anything else. She sheds 
light on the Asian identity, queerness, and feminity that overlap repeatedly. “Homophone,” 
a personal favorite of mine, is a paramount example of all of these things colliding. It 
brie/f_ly chronicles the romantic relationship between two Asian women and gives them 
rich depth over the course of a few pages. She is whip-smart at expressing the demands of 
culture and the way the world attempts to mold women. Representation alone is a power -
ful resource, but Chang’s pen transcends this by making her characters matter more than 
anything else at any given moment. 
“Gods of Want” has been one of my favorite releases of the year. My favorite stories in -
clude “Auntland,” “Nine-Headed Birds,” “Homophone,” and “Resident Aliens.” /T_he novel 
is devastating, insightful, and gripping. It hurts and it holds, but it forces you to re/f_lect. 
While I love this book and recommend it highly, I can only do so with caution. It can be 
intense and draining, especially if you align with the identities that she emphasizes, but 
the connectedness that it oﬀers exceeds the pain. 
Book Review: Gods of  Want

A/f_ter hours of waiting, the lights in the Honda Center /f_inally dimmed and the black-
and-white ‘ENHYPEN WORLD TOUR MANIFESTO’ logo /f_lashed across the screens. 
/T_housands of ‘Engenes’ — the name of Enhypen’s fans — waved their lightsticks and burst 
into full screams like they were the victims in a horror /f_ilm. Yes, my dear reader, I was one 
of them. And yes, I only just recovered my voice. 
Enhypen is a rookie Korean pop group under Beli/f_t Lab, a collaboration between South 
Korean entertainment companies CJ ENM and Hybe Corporation. Enhypen’s seven mem -
bers: Jungwon, Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo, and Ni-ki debuted in November 
2020 a/f_ter they participated in and won a competitive trainee survival show called “I-
Land.” 
/T_he group’s aﬃliation with Hybe is especially notable because it boasts some of the 
biggest names in the K-pop industry including BTS and Seventeen, as well as several up-
and-coming acts like Tomorrow X Together, Le Ssera/f_im, and New Jeans. As a fan of many 
of these Hybe groups, I was incredibly excited to see what kind of performances Enhypen 
would show oﬀ during their /f_irst world tour.
A/f_ter a cinematic opening, the camera cut to a satellite shot of the moon and Jake’s 
monologue from “Intro: Walk the Line” began to play. “With rugged woods at our back, 
we greet the sun… It shines in our eyes,” he said. 
/T_he curtain rose to the sky, coinciding with the start of an orbit around the moon and 
a pan out to a wider galaxy in the background. Stars began to shine, revealing the seven 
members all standing in gorgeous, white, and princely out/f_its. 
Taking a moment to allow the thunderous applause to run its course, Enhypen then 
got into a tight dance formation and held their locked arms in place in front of them. 
“I’m scared!” I found myself muttering, when suddenly the iconic harp melody from the 
group’s /f_irst hit song “Given-Taken” began. I was instantly stunned by their /f_luid chore -
ography and their live vocals that were crazily close to the studio version release. /T_his was 
matched by a beautiful background that became kaleidoscopic with the chorus. 
A/f_ter their performance of “Flicker,” the group took a moment's rest and stood in line to oﬀer their introductions one-by-one. Each Enhypen member talked for a few minutes 
about how excited they were to be performing and how thankful they were for the sup -
port of Engenes. Likewise, fans greeted them back with thunderous cheers and (very) loud 
confessions of love. Although the fan service is always cheesy, the ability of these idols to 
build these parasocial relationships that make you feel as if you know them personally and 
have a stake in their success is always fascinating. 
A/f_ter some performances of refreshing, upbeat songs like “Not for Sale” and “Upper 
Side Dreamin,” Enhypen ran oﬀ stage for an intermission. /T_he interlude videos shown on 
the screen portended a change in the theme of the next performances, from songs with a 
bright-faced outlook to tracks with a more ‘edgy,’ and at times even, sensual vibe to them.
/T_he seven members emerged a few minutes later on the red-lit stage having cast oﬀ the 
princely out/f_its and instead wearing /f_lowy, red silk shirts and black pants. /T_he whole sta -
dium takes on this rave-like energy as the group performs one of its most popular songs: 
“Drunk-Dazed.” /T_his was /f_itting considering its chorus includes a line about being inca -
pable of controlling your body because of an intense urge to dance. In their following song 
“One in a Billion,” the members danced on top of a fancy, white-clothed dining table for 
a portion of the song. 
For their next performance of “Fever,” Enhypen began what I considered to be one of 
the coolest dance breaks I have seen in K-pop. /T_he members positioned themselves lying 
down in a circle around Sunghoon, who was on his knees. /T_hey all put their hands on his 
neck in a choking gesture, which Sunghoon returns by strangling Jungwon in front of 
him. Sunghoon joined the rest of the members in forming a jail of arms and circling Jung -
won, who stands in a daze. /T_he members then break out into sharp choreography, which 
included cool slicing gestures as well as a much-appreciated body roll, with Jake perform -
ing a solo dance before falling on his knees for the beginning of the next song. 
A/f_ter another intermission, Enhypen returned to the stage. What I enjoyed most about 
these next set of performances was it demonstrated the duality of Enhypen and their vari -
ety of concepts. Hits like “Attention, Please” and “Blessed-Cursed” showed that these idols 
could take on hip-hop and 1970’s hard rock style music. Without skipping a beat, they 
performed the iconic, R&B pop song “Polaroid Love” and walked oﬀ stage to say hello to 
fans in the nearby stands. In their performance of “Just a Little Bit,” I was enamored with 
their raw vocals, but especially Heeseung’s incredible falsetto notes that made me ascend 
to high heaven.
To the dismay of the audience, Enhypen said their goodbyes and announced that they 
were going to be performing their last song of the evening: “Future Perfect (Pass the Mic).” 
/T_he Chicago Drill inspired song brought the house down and the crowd screamed for 
minutes on end even a/f_ter the screens faded to black, save for an Enhypen logo. 
However, seasoned K-pop concert attendees knew what was happening. It has been a 
trope for idols to pretend that they are /f_inished for the night, and, just as expected, En -
hypen came back in full force with songs like “ParadoXXX Invasion” and “Shout Out,” as 
well as one more rendition of “Future Perfect.” Just as the performance ended, the screen 
immediately /f_lashed, alerting the audience to pull out their banners, which had been 
passed out to fans as they entered the stadium, in order to surprise the group. Looking 
around the stadium, all you could see was a sea of orange signs saying, “You’re our Uni -
verse,” with the members standing in awe at the display. 
Even as a rookie K-pop group, Enhypen showed oﬀ a variety of concepts and disci -
plined performances in the /f_irst leg of their world tour. I le/f_t the stadium with a hoarse 
voice from all the screaming and cheering, and I would 100% do it again.

I’ d like to think of myself as a 
pretty independent person.
I don’t need anyone to help 
me with laundry. I make my bed 
every morning. I make sure most 
of my shoes make it onto my 
shoe rack and my trash is always 
taken out before it starts to over -
flow. Sure, I may need to look up 
a tutorial on how to change a tire 
and will probably always call my 
mom when I need relationship 
help (mostly because she loves to 
listen to the drama), but the one 
thing I can’t do alone – the one 
thing I would choose to never do 
alone – is watch a horror movie
I have what some would say to be an “overactive imagina -
tion. ” That mixed with minimal 
anxiety and irrationality can cre -
ate a less than optimal horror 
watching experience. On Hal -
loween last year I was forced to 
watch the original 1996 “Scream” 
movie and I remember not be -
ing able to sleep with the lights 
off for a few days. Even “ A Quiet 
Place” had me cowering in total 
fear until my friends told me it 
was okay to look at the screen 
again. 
With Halloween coming up, 
I can already tell I will be suc -
cumbing to watching one too 
many screamer films, so while 
I’ll never truly be able to enjoy 
the thriller genius of Stephen 
King or Jordan Peele, I can say 
that I’ve learned a few helpful 
tips and tricks to survive watch -By MAXINE MAH
/gid00013/gid00010/gid00007/gid00006/gid00020/gid00021/gid00026/gid00013/gid00006/gid00001/gid00004/gid00016/gid00015/gid00021/gid00019/gid00010/gid00003/gid00022/gid00021/gid00010/gid00015/gid00008/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019ing a horror movie. 
1. Don’t
Of course, the easiest way to 
not absolutely traumatize your -
self with kidnappers, murderers, 
demons, and dolls that come to 
life is to simply omit all encoun -
ters with them in the first place. 
As we all (hopefully) know, the 
choice to watch this movie is 
our own, so if you know you’ll 
end up peeing your seat or hav -
ing absolutely petrifying night -
mares, your best chance is to just 
avoid it all together.
2. Go with people you LOVE
Although it would be awe -
some to end my list of tips after 
number 1, we all know that say -
ing no is simply not an option if 
you have horror- loving friends. If Option 1 fails (as it most likely 
will because FOMO and peer 
pressure love to hear you scream 
in a crowded theater) your sec -
ond best option is to go with 
people who will actually protect 
you. Recently, I went to UC San 
Diego’s free showing of “Black 
Phone” (for those of you who 
were there at the 9 p.m. showing, 
I am so sorry you had to see me 
in a moment of weakness), and 
even though I closed my eyes 
for over half the film, I went 
with people who were fully pre -
pared for me to simply decay in 
my seat. One of my friends had 
seen the movie twice already and 
resolved to drag my head down 
whenever a jump scare was com -
ing up (thank you, Amanda, I 
love you). In conclusion, the 
same people who dragged you to How to Survive a Horror Movie
your metaphorical death should 
also be the ones helping dig your 
coffin.
3. Don’t sit alone
This one may seem insignifi -
cant, but it’s actually the most 
criminally underrated survival 
hack. 
Think about it: you’re in a 
crowded theater about to watch 
a movie that you don’t re -
ally want to see and you know 
you’re going to be scared out of 
your mind. The worst thing that 
could possibly happen is sitting 
next to someone you don’t know 
– someone who doesn’t fit the 
criteria of tip & trick number 2. 
Even worse, you could be sitting 
next to an empty chair – a dark 
abyss of loneliness to remind you 
that you are alone, or at least not 
surrounded by those you trust. 
Sitting between your friends 
guarantees you safety-cuddles 
and endless protection from 
whatever antagonist this horror 
is about to show you. 
4. Cover your eyes and ears
Now that you’ve safely made 
it inside the theater, sitting be -
tween your amazing friends 
that will protect you with their 
lives, you can officially start … 
“watching?”
I’ve found that the best way 
to save yourself from the after -
math of horror movies is to just 
simply not watch the movie. It 
becomes plainly obvious when 
scary things are about to hap -
pen, so when you notice the mu -
sic starting to thin out, the lights 
beginning to dim, and the main 
character about to do something 
that they probably should not be 
doing, cover your eyes and ears. 
What I personally like to do is to 
look at the floor and shove my 
fingers into my ears, then said 
besties who are protecting you 
can let you know when the scare 
is over and you’re free to look 
back up at the non-terrifying 
parts.
Of course, none of us can 
prevent the onset of nightmares

I, like most UC San Diego 
students, am pretty busy. Be -
tween homework, my job, extra -
curriculars, and now a commute 
to school, I feel like I barely have 
time to breathe. Something that 
has been particularly challeng -
ing for me is cooking. Since I 
have moved into my apartment, 
I have found that cooking takes 
a long time, not to mention the 
grocery store trips and wash -
ing dishes. It has gotten to the 
point where if I wanted to make 
a homemade meal, I would end 
up behind in everything else. 
This is why I decided to try 
out meal prepping. By this, I 
mean planning out what I am 
going to eat ahead of time and 
pre-preparing everything to the 
best of my ability. This could en -
tail pre-cooking all your meals 
or simply chopping up the ingre -
dients you already know you’re 
going to use. Though meal prep -
ping has been in existence for 
quite a long time, I see it most 
on TikTok, where people recom -
mend different food-prep meals 
to put in little containers for the 
rest of the week. I have been try -
ing the same for a few weeks now 
and, while not an expert, I feel at 
least a little qualified to tell you 
all about it. 
Let’s start with the benefits of 
meal prep. The main thing that 
I have noticed is that the pre-made meal structure reduces 
your cooking time to ten min -
utes or less. There is also far less 
cleaning to be done afterwards. 
My grocery trips have also been 
faster, seeing that I know exactly 
what I am prepping and what I 
need to buy. This also allows me 
to plan to buy things that are on 
sale by looking on the website 
or grocery store ads. I have also 
discovered that planning ahead 
of time makes me less likely to 
buy impulsive purchases. 
Additionally, prepping my 
meals ahead of time has result -
ed in them being healthier and By SAMANTHA PHAN
/gid00013/gid00010/gid00007/gid00006/gid00020/gid00021/gid00026/gid00013/gid00006/gid00001/gid00024/gid00019/gid00010/gid00021/gid00006/gid00019
more balanced. When I plan my 
meals, I am able to make sure 
that I am including every group 
on the food pyramid. Before this 
I was just eating what I had avail -
able, which usually only had one 
or two different food groups. 
Having a more colorful and nu -
tritious plate has been a great 
change of pace for me. 
However, there are defi -
nitely downsides to meal prep. 
Although I personally like the 
consistency, many people do not 
like eating the same meal several 
days in a row. I will admit that 
it is easy to get sick of even your favorite meals if you are hav -
ing them every day. I have also 
found that it is hard to keep 
track of portion sizes because 
the truth is, you do not know 
how hungry you’ll be until right 
before you eat, possibly making 
the meal you have packed either 
too big or too small. You also 
might prepare too much food at 
the start of the week (or however 
far ahead you plan for) and it can 
go bad before you can eat it all. 
And finally, although cooking 
will be quicker most days, you 
usually have to set aside one to 
two hours every week to actually The Truth About Meal Prepping
do the prepping. 
So, there it is. The real truth 
about meal prep. Personally, I 
enjoy it. It saves me time, money, 
and effort, and who am I to say 
no to that? However, I totally un -
derstand those of you who will 
say, “no thanks, I’ll try some -
thing else. ” Meal prepping is not 
for everyone, and the sooner you 
find out what works for you, the 
better. 
That’s all for today. Have fun 
cooking!

UC San Diego, as you might 
have observed, does not have a 
football team. Given that UCSD 
isn’t known for its focus on ath -
letics, you might be forgiven for 
assuming, like I did for three and 
a half years of my time here, that 
we’ve never had one.
Or so I thought. /T_he truth, as 
usual, turns out to be in/f_initely 
more fascinating.
In 1968, during the /f_irst few 
years of the existence of the young 
UC campus, UCSD played its /f_irst 
season of intercollegiate football: a 
seven-game schedule that pitted it 
against a collection of universities 
who have mostly also abandoned 
their football teams by now. /T_hat 
includes the hapless Caltech Bea -
vers, a historically poor football 
team that had lost 34 games in 
a row to that point — nobody 
on the team had ever played in a 
Caltech win — and their quarter -
back was also their kicker, punter, 
and defensive back.
And of those seven games, 
how many did our /f_ighting Tritons 
win? Zero. And that /f_irst 1968 sea -
son of college football would also 
be UCSD’s last.
So maybe it’s understandable 
that this single, successless season 
of mediocre football is not even 
a footnote to UCSD’s history —  
only discovered if you look for it. 
But I’m here to tell you that just 
because this 54-year-old season Looking Back at The Single Year of  Triton Football
UC San Diego Men’s Soccer is Narrowly Upset by UC Riversidemight seem like a heap of futility, 
there is still a captivating story to 
tell.
/T_his summer, by digging into 
dozens of newspapers by the 
Triton Times (now /T_he UCSD 
Guardian), contemporary news 
coverage, documentary footage 
from the early days of UCSD, and 
other sources, I tried to tell the 
story of that singular Triton foot -
ball team. 
Initially, I planned to make an 
article, maybe two, about the sub -
ject, but as I read through those 
54-year-old pieces of student 
journalism, it turned out that the 
football team was just one part of 
what might have been the most in -
teresting year in UCSD history. So 
now, a few months later, I’ve made 
a 71-minute long documentary 
about the football team and the 
university it inhabited, and you 
can watch it here.
In this article, though, I’ d like to tell you about some of the high -
lights, especially as they pertain to 
the football team. 
/T_he football team at UCSD 
came to fruition a/f_ter a student 
petition calling for the establish -
ment of a team reached over a 
thousand signatures. Respond -
ing to the requests, the university 
made its coaching hire, picking up 
Walt Hackett, a San Diego Char -
gers defensive line coach and a 
born-and-raised native of San Di -
ego County. Hackett shocked the 
team by informing them that they 
wouldn’t be starting with a couple 
of warmup years in the junior var -
sity ranks like some programs, but 
that they’ d be going right into var -
sity contention.
/T_hings started rough. /T_he 
Tritons scored /f_irst in their /f_irst 
match with a touchdown against 
the University of La Verne, but it 
would be their /f_inal mark on the 
scoreboard. Final score? 41–6. /T_he rest of the Tritons’ games had 
similar score lines — a/f_ter all, the 
small roster forced many players 
to play on both defense and of -
fense, making fatigue a major fac -
tor. While reports on Triton fan 
morale were positive, the most 
commonly mentioned note is that 
the all-new cheerleading team 
struggled to spell UCSD, chanting 
“U-S-C-D” in the season opener.
/T_he exception, of course, was 
the game against Caltech. I break 
down this game and the circum -
stances surrounding it in /f_iner de -
tail in my documentary, but long 
story short, the Tritons only lost 
the contest by three points. Had 
they not thrown a key intercep -
tion to the Caltech quarterback/
cornerback/kicker/punter and 
missed four point-a/f_ter attempts, 
this would be a very diﬀerent 
story. As for Caltech, the campus 
went wild a/f_ter the win, with bon -
/f_ires raging in Pasadena and the 
Caltech players attempting brie/f_ly 
to hoist their coach on their shoul -
ders.
Ultimately, the football team 
was a short-lived experiment. 
/T_he Triton players weren’t given 
scholarships or even physical 
education credits, and increasing 
numbers of them, along with the 
more successful basketball team, 
were planning on transferring or 
not playing the next season. A/f_ter 
a student referendum to allow pri -
vate — not even school-sponsored 
— scholarships to athletes failed, 
the football team was disbanded, 
never to return. /T_he Tritons re -main undefeated since then.
/T_his is just a meager summary 
of the team’s history, but even just 
telling the story of UCSD in 1968 
would be an injustice. While read -
ing those old newspapers, I learned 
that the football team wasn’t even 
close to the most interesting thing 
happening at UCSD that year. 
Protests abounded over academic 
freedom and the Vietnam War on 
campus, with /f_igures like Gover -
nor Ronald Reagan, the father of 
the New Le/f_t Herbert Marcuse, 
and activist and master’s student 
Angela Davis all converging in La 
Jolla. 1968 was a tense, eventful 
year all over the United States and 
at UCSD, and trust me, it was not 
because of football.
If any of this has sounded in -
teresting to you, give the docu -
mentary a watch. (Or add it to 
your Y ouTube “Watch Later” play -
list and let it sit there for months 
until you work up the desire to 
watch it — that’s what I’ d do.) 
/T_here’s dozens of fun little UCSD 
stories in there, and given that 
I and most students I know are 
aware of very little from the early 
history of the university, I hope it 
can give you a much fuller idea of 
what this university used to look 
like. At a school that is spending 
millions of dollars to market itself 
as one of the future, /f_launting its 
own “nontradition, ” there may yet 
be some value in looking into the 
past.

/T_he UC San Diego Men’s Soc -
cer Team (5–5–2, 1–2–0 Big West) 
lost a nail-biter against the UC 
Riverside Highlanders (3–6–2, 
2–1–0 Big West). /T_he Tritons were 
trailing the majority of a game, 
and fell by a score of 1–0. Al -
though there were multiple great 
opportunities, the Tritons were 
unable to convert against a rigid 
Highlanders defense, and so the 
Tritons faltered on home turf.
Before the match even began, 
there was a signi/f_icant delay due 
to an unfortunate injury to the 
lead referee. Once that was swi/f_tly 
resolved, the game began with 
each team playing as they had 
been in recent games. UC Riv -
erside came into the game with 
a propensity for having a leaky 
defense and playing at a deliber -
ate pace. To start the match, both 
of these trends were manifesting 
themselves again with UC River -
side struggling to sustain any of -
fense, whereas UCSD got quick 
opportunities near the goal. 
/T_he Tritons seemed to have all 
the momentum early on, which 
had carried on from their success 
in recent weeks. /T_hree minutes 
into the match, aggressive play 
from sophomore forward Max 
Carvalho netted the Tritons an 
early opportunity. Shortly there -
a/f_ter, Carvalho passed to gradu -
ate defender Jake Serpa, who sent 
a beautiful pass that resulted in a 
header by senior mid/f_ielder Ales -
sandro Allen, who forced a diﬃ -
cult save.
/T_he game would mostly fol -
low this encapsulated pattern of 
UCSD threatening, but not being 
able to convert a/f_ter the High -
lander’s condensed their defense. 
/T_hrough the /f_irst 20 minutes, the 
action was favoring UCSD in terms of possession, but UC Riv -
erside did have one good chance 
that ended with a shot that sailed 
high. 
/T_he exception to the gen -
eral pattern of toothless threats 
coupled with dominating posses -
sion was broken for UCSD when 
defense against a UC Riverside 
counterattack went awry. Devel -
oping fast, the Highlanders sur -
prisingly broke their slow form by 
pushing the issue against a light 
UCSD defense. While the Triton 
defense initially stood strong, a 
kick inside the box took an unfor -
tunate bounce of a de/f_lection. /T_he 
score stood at 1–0, and the Tritons 
would have to now come from be -
hind to earn a home victory.
/T_he Tritons looked unphased, as they had recently completed a 
similar comeback feat in the prior 
game. /T_he team once again domi -
nated possession, and another 
great chance was had stemming 
from a pass from junior mid/f_ield -
er Alan Kim, which sophomore 
mid/f_ielder Andrew Valverde le/f_t  
just a touch too high. 
A/f_ter the half, more of the 
same persisted for the Tritons. 
Possession was a little more even, 
but the Tritons continued to push 
the pace, whereas the opposition 
was clearly playing conservatively 
to stall the Tritons oﬀense. UCSD 
earned a few corner kicks, but 
each was thwarted by an unchar -
acteristically suﬀocating High -
lander defense. 
A/f_ter a few more changes in possession, the 76th minute came 
along with a golden opportunity 
for the Tritons. Junior mid/f_ielder 
Jack Hagan received a de/f_lected 
ball deep inside the box with only 
one defender between the ball and 
a free shot at the net. Hagan’s at -
tempt to fake out the defender was 
intercepted, so he was not able to 
attempt what would have been the 
cleanest shot on goal the Tritons 
would have had on the night. 
With nine minutes to go, 
UCSD attempted to follow UC 
Riverside’s model and launch a 
quick and surprising attack. Ales -
sandro Allan launched a nice kick, 
but the goalkeeper de/f_lected it 
out of bounds resulting in a cor -
ner kick for the Tritons. Unable 
to convert, the Highlanders were able to run out the clock without 
much of a hitch, culminating in a 
1–0 loss for the Tritons. 
While the Tritons were im -
pressive in many facets of the 
game, it comes down to who can 
put the ball in the back of the net. 
/T_he team certainly showed their 
/f_ighting spirit until the end, and 
will surely bounce back as this 
season goes on. /T_he next match 
for the men’s soccer team comes 
on Oct. 12, when the Tritons will 
look to exact a convincing victory 
against another Big West foe in a 
trip to California State University, 
Fullerton.
