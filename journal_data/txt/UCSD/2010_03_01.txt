DO YOU THINK RACISM 
IS A PROBLEM ON CAMPUS?
 ‘SHUT  IT DOWN’
By Angela Chen
News Editor
Student protesters occupied the Chancellor’s 
Complex for over six hours on Friday, calling for 
administrators to shut down the university and respond to a list of demands issued one week 
before by the Black Student Union. 
The BSU altered their requests  
from the original 32 demands to a conslidated list. For example, the BSU no longer calls for a change to a holistic admissions system, but instead wants the current comprehensive review system to 
include additional points for first-generation students and those who attended schools in the fourth or fifth quintile. 
The sit-in was in response to the discovery of 
a noose hanging from a light fixtureon the sev-enth floor of Geisel Library on Feb. 25 — the lat-est in a string of racially charged events, includ-ing a “Compton Cookout” party held Feb. 15 and slurs aired on Student-Run Television Feb. 18. 
According to a police bulletin e-mailed to all 
students and faculty Thursday night, the UCSD police received reports of a noose — histori-cally used in black lynchings — at approximately 10:30 p.m. on Feb. 25. The incident is being treated as a crime with “intent to terrorize. ” 
Leaders of the BSU immediately planned 
a protest for the following morning at 8 a.m. The Library Walk rally drew approximately 300 participants, including speakers from BSU, the LGBT community and faculty. 
Sociology professor Ivan Evans spoke heav-
ily about the “special horror of lynching” and called for the students to take direct action.

Ihave a story that needs to be heard. I am the girl you’ve read about, the one who hung the noose in Geisel Library.
Firstly, I’m writing to apologize. I don’t have 
an excuse for what I did, and I deeply regret it. 
Secondly, I’m writing to hopefully put a little 
bit of faith back into the UCSD campus by clari-fying that it was not an act of racism. This is what happened. ▶  /=-;<+755-6<):A

Activists at UC Irvine and UCLA 
have responded to three race-related 
incidents at UCSD over the last two weeks, holding demonstrations in sup-port of black students at UCSD.
At around 9:30 a.m. on Feb. 24, a 
group of about 20 UCI students and employees barricaded themselves into the UCI administration building. One hour later, they issued a list of 15 demands including increased funding for the ethnic studies department — a request motivated by the recent events at UCSD.
“ As evidenced so blatantly at UCSD 
this past week, black subjects are in an antagonistic position against the insti-tution; this sentiment is reinforced by administration, and creates a safe space for anti-blackness, ” they stated in the document. 
Seventeen students and universi-
ty employees were cited for unlawful assembly and refusal to disperse, lead-ing to the protest’s breakup at 2:40 p.m. 
Students at UCLA held their own 
sit-in on Feb. 26. Led by the Afrikan Student Union of UCLA, about 100 protesters occupied the office of UCLA Chancellor Gene Block and demanded that he pressure Fox into taking deci-sive action against racism at UCSD.

Students looking to add a shiny new 
card to their wallets will have to start buttering up their parents. The Credit Card Responsibility and Disclosure Act, effective Feb. 21, has placed new restrictions on credit-card companies, including a provision that requires all those under 21 to have a co-signer when opening a new line of credit.
The federal legislation aims to 
prevent credit-card companies from exploiting consumers. According to Gregory Cendana, president of the United States Students Association,

“They have gone where they should 
not have gone, and I believe we should 
respond appropriately, ” he said. “I don’t believe it is the chancellor’s role to shut the university down, and I believe it would be difficult for her to do so. I believe it is our role to do that. ”
Campuswide Senator Desiree 
Prevo referenced the recent reac-tion from members of student media organizations to A.S. President Utsav Gupta’s funding freeze last Friday, a reaction to BSU requests to shut down controversial humor newspaper the Koala . Prevo said this was not a free-
speech issue.
“The Bill of Rights, in which the 
free-speech document came from, was never meant to include my peo-ple — our people — so how do you expect me to respect free speech, when I was never supposed to have free speech?” Prevo asked.
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox 
emerged from the Chancellor’s Complex to speak to the crowd. She said all criminal violators would be punished.
Vice Chancellor of Resource and Management Gary Matthews then came forward, revealing that a female student had confessed to hanging the noose around 9:30 a.m., and had turned in her two accomplices. 
According to a letter to the 
Guardian from the student who hung 
the noose, the incident was “a mind-less act and stupid mistake. ” The stu-dent, whose identity has not been released, has been suspended for an indefinite period of time. 
California Law AB 412, passed 
in August 2009, states that hanging a noose in a public area is a misde-meanor punishable up to a year in jail and a $5,000 fine. However, the suspended student has not yet been taken into custody.
Protesters expressed their unhap-
piness with the administration reac-tion, and marched to the Chancellor’s Complex at noon. 
Fox emerged once more to assure 
protesters that the university was tak-ing action against hate on campus.
“I strongly condemn the offen-
sive acts of hate and bias that have occurred over the past days, ” Fox said.  Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny Rue echoed Fox’s sentiments. 
“Y ou can’t imagine how pained 
we are over this, ” she said. “We are heartsick. ”
However, Fox made no mention 
of a campus shutdown, prompting protesters to pressure her to meet with the Academic Senate to deter-mine if one was feasible. Meanwhile, demonstrators moved into Fox’s office to host an impromptu sit-in. 
At approximately 2 p.m., the 
chancellor said she saw no reason for a shutdown, causing protesters to occupy her office until 5 p.m.
At 5:30 p.m., members of the BSU 
emerged from their meeting with Fox to announce that she had not adequately met their demands. 
“They handed us over a bullshit-
ass document, ” BSU Vice Chair Fnann Keflezighi said to the crowd after the meeting. “Basically, it said everything that we already knew, no concrete things on how they’re going to implement anything. They’re dumber than we thought they were — dumber than I thought they were. ”

Block responded by reading a letter 
signed by UC President Mark Yudof 
and the other nine UC chancellors — including Fox — that condemned the acts of intolerance at UCSD.
“We will not allow the actions of 
a few to speak for this University, ” the statement read. “We denounce them. We have a responsibility to speak out against activities that promote intoler-ance or undermine civil dialogue. As always, the remedy for bad speech is good speech. ”
The ASU was moved to act when 
the BSU sent a letter to organizations at various UC campuses on Feb. 19, declaring a “state of emergency” at UCSD.
“Please stand on solidarity with our 
Brothers and Sisters from UCSD ... Our students at UCSD are being silenced and made uncomfortable, ” the ASU said in a statement posted on their Web site.

According to the 11-page document 
responding to the BSU’s original demands, the 
university will begin taking steps to create a per-manent task force to increase diversity aware-ness on campus and fill the vacant program-coordinator position for the African-American Studies Minor. (The full text of this document can be found online at www.battlehate.ucsd.edu/
docs/implementation_of_demands.pdf.)
 Despite escalating racial tensions on cam-
pus, many demonstrators expressed the belief that the incident has created greater solidarity within the UCSD community. 
“I came to the protest because I’m part of this 
community and this coalition, ” Muir College senior Indiana Rogers said. “These are people that I know, and people that are being disgraced. ”
In addition, members of the Newman Center 
Catholic Community at UCSD planned to spread roses in Geisel Library at the site where the noose had been hung to show support for the BSU.
“We wanted to put something loving there 
instead of something so hateful, ” said Anita Bradford, a graduate student in the history department. “We wanted to show our support. ”
The  BSU plans to mobilize again on March 
1 at 10 a.m. on Library Walk, where they will continue to pressure the administration to adhere to their demands.

It’s hard to believe the “Compton 
Cookout” was only two weeks ago today. Two emotionally 
charged rallies and teach-ins later  — snowballed by idiot moves from the Koala  and an anonymous girl with 
a rope — racial tensions on campus have reached epic proportions. 
When you Google “UCSD” and 
the first predictive text that comes up is “UCSD noose, ” you know you’ve got a problem.
Interestingly enough, if each of 
the three racist incidents is consid-ered in isolation, it becomes clear that a couple ignorant/unfeeling individuals with too much time on their hands have managed to set our campus up in flames.
Elliot Van Nostrand and his 
bros copied some Urban Dictionary definitions and tied them to Black History Month — a bad joke that was not theirs to make, of course, but one they somehow had little idea would appall the students it targeted. Koala  
Editor in Chief Kris Gregorian was undoubtedly more aware of the dag-ger he was throwing on Student-Run Television, but his clan has a long history of exploiting the right to hate speech, and it was only timing that gave one self-important idealogue this power to do real harm. (In addi-tion, the cardboard scrap reading “Compton lynching” later found in the studio is known to have been written as a joke prompt by a nonstu-dent standerby. Stupid.) Most recent-ly, the female student who came forward for leaving a noose in Geisel Library claims it was out of clueless negligence; so whether or not she’s just playing dumb, the girl doesn’t seem to be out to get anybody.
Unfortunately, intent does not 
change the severity of effect — especially when the face ratio of non-black aggressors to the victims of their “joke” (who lack the luxury of finding it funny, or access to any-thing near as hurtful in the weapon cabinet of history with which to fight back) is 100 to one. Add a followup shitstorm of Internet commentary and gleeful side-picking, and it’s apparent why the “toxic environ-ment” at UCSD has become so slimy.
As we can see, the danger is much 
larger than this motley crew of fire-starters. There may not be visible protests against the campus-diversi-fying demands of the Black Student Union, but a thunderous sentiment can be heard across Facebook threads and cafeteria whispers: The 20,000 students not marching in 
solidarity with the BSU are jumping to the defensive conclusion that black students’ demands are too dramatic, or that this is a simple issue of free speech, and all those hurt by racial comments don’t have the right to not be offended.
No, the malicious gut feeling cur-
rently permeating UCSD cannot be blamed on three isolated flareups of ignorance, but on the blank stares they have unveiled and spiteful mur-murs they have uncorked. Anyone who still thinks there is no racism at this school, after witnessing the righ-teous reaction of the general populous to the pain of the targeted few, with no concept of the inequality from birth between races in our country, should indeed be dragged kicking and screaming into the general-education requirements the BSU has proposed. 
When a cornerstone of American 
society like the black population, whose presence at this university means exponentially more than its sparse percentage, feels so threatened as to not be able to enter their own library, it becomes all of our problem.
Let’s prioritize here. Y es, A.S. 
President Utsav Gupta breached the trust of all student publications on campus — not to mention the content-neutral principles of the First Amendment — by pulling media-org funding in the name of cutting off the Koala . And believe us, he will get 
what’s coming to him. But it’s impor-tant to separate that issue from the social justice the BSU is requesting; they are not asking for anyone else to be silenced, and wouldn’t have that jurisdiction anyway. They are only asking for outreach and retention, so they can exist on campus with the critical strength that would give them a fighting chance to resist — or at least not feel crushed or attacked — when slurs conjuring the violent oppression of their ancestors are thrown around in the name of freedom.
With the exception of a few hun-
dred students willing to trek out in support of the BSU at 8 a.m. — or at least become more educated on 
See RACISM page 5The prospect of sleeping on a stranger’s floor in a foreign country raises a number 
of questions: How many sweaty, unclothed travelers past have grazed this blanket? Should I run and find a hostel before it’s too late? Is it cool to borrow toothpaste?
How-to Guru knows firsthand that 
couch-surfing is a daunting activity. 
That’s why, armed with a summer’s 
worth of cramped necks and awkward breakfasts, the Guru is here to help. 
Those first moments on the 
doorstep before an affirming “wilkommen ” or “ bienvenidos”  present 
a huge opportunity for self-doubt. On my first surf, though, before there was any time to reconsider, the door opened and a tall, beaming hipster came out to hug me. Within five minutes, I was offered a joint, a beer and homemade pizza — I was hooked.
It’s hard to resist a strong German 
ale, but it’s still important to be discriminating. The first rule of 
cautious travel is this: Do your research. Read through your potential host’s profile on www.couchsurfing.
org before contacting 
him; a section featuring references from people who have either hosted or surfed with the 
member will help you decide whose sofa is right for you. Though an online testimonial may not be a 100-percent guarantee that you’ll wake up with all your limbs and sleepwear intact, hardcore couch-surfers take their sport pretty seriously, and won’t vouch for someone for no reason.
Just to be safe, hit up several hosts 
at once — and never set out without a backup  plan. The last thing you want 
is to find yourself alone in a foreign city with nowhere to crash. So even if all your couch-surfing prospects fall through — which is highly unlikely — it never hurts to have a hostel in mind.

Dear Editor,
I know you’ve received numer-
ous e-mails and calls about the recent discovery of the noose, and also word on future noose hangings. I know the racial tensions at UCSD are running very high right now, but I refuse to 
believe that this overt racism exists at 
UCSD, and I’m challenging the exist-ing thought paradigm that the Black Student Union is being marginalized. Its voice is being heard — and excuse me if I’m wrong — but the noose found in Geisel Library on Thursday night “validates” BSU feelings of being threatened and gives it a bigger voice. So I wouldn’t rule out the intentional 
planting of the noose to provoke and 
escalate the issue in BSU’s favor.
This is more than a case of playing devil’s advocate; I heard (in passing) members of BSU talking about a noose in the library after last nights A.S. open forum meeting, which ended at 10 p.m. According to news reports, the noose was found mid-night of the same night. How did they know about it before it happened, and why didn’t BSU mention this at the meeting if they knew about the noose in advance? I’m not making an unsubstantiated claim here — I even saw the same person in the original noose photo who was talking about it 
at the meeting.

be free; we want to overcome; we want to win. But we cannot fight for freedom and peace, because the very nature of a fight precludes both freedom and peace — in fact, it per-
petuates the cycle of oppression. It 
necessitates that one party prevails over another, and in that scenario, both sides feel threatened and react accordingly. Fighting against some-thing merely serves to reinforce it. What is called for, then, what pounds in our hearts and brings us flocking together, is a yearning for awareness; a shift in consciousness.
Suss it out. On what level does 
the issue exist? It is a matter of human emotion and how we choose to express our feelings? Is this war-fare, or welfare? 
Discrimination is supposed to 
be illegal, but how can we prosecute perception? We have arrived at the reality of how people treat each other. This is about human rights and it’s inextricable from any other inconsideration committed by one person against another. Repression, crime and war are all symbolic of the isolation of the psyche, just as com-ing together to create a movement for positive change is symbolic of the 
connection of the soul. 
Over the course of history we 
have won many battles — only to 
keep fighting. This is the human condition. We are all hurt. We’ve got to stop fighting and start feeling. To truly succeed in making a change, we must first cultivate a deeper awareness of the atmosphere we are creating … We must infuse ourselves 
with compassion, understanding and 
acceptance. (This is the only state of mind in which we can actually LIVE, not just visit on the weekends.)
Secret to destroying the enemy? Love it to death. In the light of love, the enemy disappears. It is only our own shadows that prevents us from seeing each other and treating each other as equals. It’s a collective effort that must be taken personally; we can only be responsible for our own emotions and emissions. Keep an open heart.

Both hosts and fellow surfers 
are always eager to talk about their experiences. Some of Guru’s best couch-surfing memories have been just hanging out around the kitchen table, comparing cultures and exploring new ways of life over a beer. 
Always follow house rules. Don’t 
overstay your welcome,  and don’t 
be that annoying little sister begging your hosts to take you out every night — remember, these are people who, not unlike your freewheeling self, go to school and have jobs. And upon your departure, don’t forget to give back in some way. This can mean cooking a meal, doing the dishes, fixing their bike or (if you really want to be invited back) buying them a bottle of wine. Hosts that can vouch for you make it much easier to earn invitations from all over the world.

And in many cases, apathy has even grown fangs. How is it necessary to start a group called “UCSD Students Outraged That People Are Outraged About the Compton Cookout” or “UCSD Students Against the Demands of the UCSD BSU”? Just because someone got it together before you to demand what they deserve from the university, you don’t have to degrade one of the most necessary fights in our history — the civil-rights movement, which is not over by any means — by rattling off some uninformed babble about basing treatment on academic merits, not the color of one’s skin. If we exist-ed in isolation of history, if we had all started in wigs with feather pens, there might be less of a need for this moment of solidarity. Just because our ancestors messed up the possibility of self-sustaining social justice doesn’t mean we’re free from the responsibil-ity to recognize their shortcomings and do all we can to right that wrong.
Predictably, Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox mostly avoided solid fis-cal solutions to the BSU’s bold list of demands in her Friday-afternoon address. But if the amount of drive they have shown so far is any indica-tion, they will not stop until every proposed task force has made at least one step toward strengthening their chances of survival on this campus. It may seem dramatic, but without the most extreme and comprehensive request to stabilize the black popu-lation on campus and educate the rest, toxic environments like this will remain possible, and extremists like the Koala  will exist as a tool of mar-
ginalization instead of ridiculousness.
I know you didn’t personally limit 
black opportunity in this country, but when you fail to recognize there is a problem, you become a part of it. So instead of wasting your time cut-ting down a people who have never received anything but the short end of the stick, let’s show a little love and admiration.

▶ GURU, MYVTWHNLA DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lázaro
I found a small piece of rope 
on the ground earlier in the day. While I was hanging out with my friends a bit later, we tried jump-roping with it and making it into a lasso. My friend then took the rope and tied it into a noose. I innocently marveled at his ability to tie a noose, without thinking of any of its connotations or the current racial climate at UCSD. I left soon after with one of my friends for Geisel to study, still carrying the rope. After a bit of studying I picked up the rope to play with, and ended up hanging it by my desk. It was a mindless act and stupid mistake. When I got up to leave, a couple hours later, I simply forgot about it. This was Tuesday night. Three days later, on Friday morning, I found out that the noose had been found and construed as another racist act on campus. I felt so ashamed and embarrassed, and the first thing I did was call the campus police and confess. I was hoping to clarify that this was not an act of racism before the incident got a full reaction from the campus. I gave my statement around 9 a.m. They thanked me for coming forward and for trying to clear up the issue. Later, I received a campuswide e-mail saying that I confessed and had been taken into custody, which simply wasn’t true. One thing that is true is that I have been suspended. I know what I did was offensive — regardless of my intentions — I am just try-ing to say I’m sorry. As a minority student who sympathizes with the students that have been affected by the recent issues on campus, I am distraught to know that I have unintentionally added to their pain.

A Rhode Island school was the 
recent picture of upheaval, as 
74 teachers and 19 staff members were fired due to the school’s pitiful academic performance (its gradu-ation rate is a meager 48 percent). The mass firing was a response to a failed reform attempt at Central Falls High School, ironically titled “The Turnaround Plan. ”
But with a sizable chunk of stu-
dents siding with the teachers, it’s doubtful any of them will react well to being taught by a whole new crop of vulnerable hires. The negative media attention can’t be sending a good ral-lying message to potential applicants, either: “Want job security? Keep looking. ” The school’s frigid location, massive dropout rate and dwindling resources make it a less-than-stellar place to work to say the least. 
Punishing and rewarding teach-
ers on a merit basis may seem a novel idea, but when it translates into huge firings, it discourages others from entering the field of education altogether — or, at the very least, to not bother sending an application to Central Falls High School. Applicants might as well save their time and apply to a school on the other side of town, where the graduation and turn-over rates aren’t so dismal and con-flict is relegated to the football field.
—Neda Salamat
Staff Writer The alarming Central High Falls School dropout statistics speak 
for themselves. But firing all 93 staff members isn’t the solution to rectify-ing this educational nightmare. 
The school’s problem runs deeper 
than its faculty. With 63 percent of students qualifying for free lunches and 41 percent living in poverty, students are dropping out work full time. 
The district is placing undue 
blame on the easiest scapegoat: teachers. Because when teens are dropping out of school to work full time, even the most inspiring educa-tors can’t keep them in their seats. 
New employees will likely have 
less experience in the classroom, and even less experience in a classroom in which one in two students don’t have hopes of crossing the stage. 
Instead of skimming the surface 
of the issue, the district should be working toward a more comprehen-sive solution that takes into account the difficult lifestyle of the school’s students. The district must make greater efforts to encourage and stress the importance of an educa-tion — not remove those who may have been the only positive role models in students’ lives. 
—Cheryl Hori
Associate Opinion EditorThe recent firing of Central Falls High School’s 74 teachers was 
obviously a risky move — but the school’s abysmal graduation rate proves it was also a necessary one. When less than half the class is even graduating, it’s a surefire indicator that a school must be reformed. In this case, the faculty dismissals were, in fact, the final option after multiple failed attempts at reform, including a request from the state to increase the faculty’s workload (which the teachers’ union vehe-mently denied). If one’s job calls for overtime but the worker fails to perform, someone else who values the position more deserves to come in — and that’s exactly the case for Central Falls High School.
In light of today’s economy, 
when — regardless of lousy pay or demanding hours — it’s more necessary than ever to cling to a job, there’s sure to be a gaggle of resume-bearers in the principal’s office ready to snatch up whatever position they can. The employed — and that includes the teachers at Central Falls High School — must be doing cartwheels to keep that paycheck coming back, whether they like it or not.

the act is a step toward much-needed credit-card reform.
Cedana said the act prohibits credit-
card companies from offering gifts to students under 21 for opening up credit-card accounts, preventing exploitation. 
“CitiBank or other companies would 
visit campus and say, ‘Hey, if you open a credit card we’ll give you a T-shirt or pizza, ’” Cendana said.
In addition, credit-card companies 
can no longer send students under 21 pre-screened credit cards. Previously, credit-card companies could issue ready-to-use cards to potential clients by mail, eliminating the application process.
According to Cendana, pre-screened 
cards take advantage of students because students are less familiar with the system and more likely to accept without being aware of the details.
“We found that a lot of companies 
have also been doing targeted mailings to lots of students, and it ends up being overwhelming, ” Cendana said. “We feel that there could potentially be other ways to fund schooling before taking out credit cards. ”
The final restriction requires that 
customers under 21 have a co-signer — typically a parent — when opening a new credit line, unless they have proof of adequate income. This is meant to protect students from recklessly spend-ing themselves into debt. 
“I do think it’s a good step, ” Revelle 
College freshman Joanna Lee said. “It will help students be more responsible and less carefree. There won’t just be some plastic to use to spend. ”
Cendana said the government should 
continue to put additional restrictions on credit cards.
“It takes small steps towards reform, 
but there’s larger financial reform that needs to be addressed, ” Cendana said.

AlaskaTAKE A HIKE IN
If you’re sick of La Jolla sand and sun and looking 
for a change in scenery, consider Denali National Park in Alaska. Stay at a hostel just outside the 
park, where fellow explorers are aplenty. Believe me: Y ou’ll appreciate the company while heading off into a wilderness filled with real-life grizzly bears and wolves by the motherload, helping ensure your trip doesn’t end like Christopher McCandless’ journey “Into the Wild.”
The park is open late May to mid-September, 
because summer is really the only time to visit. The 
six-million-acre stakeout has just one road: a dirt 
path cleared specifically for the park’s buses. Since Denali has few hiking trails, you should grab a bus ticket and head down the road on a brief driving tour. Take in the reds and greens of the tundra and the abundant snowy peaks or ask the driver to let you off to hike for a few hours. Once you’ve exhaust-ed yourself meandering the untouched wilderness, make your way back to the road and grab the next Jam
JAMAICA
Once your classical tropical locales get old and you need a break from Hawaii or Mexico, think a little farther south.
I’m talking about Jamaica — the tropical paradise 
where every smiling face is excited to make you a member of the laid-back island family. 
Make like a tourist and hit Jamaica’s Mystic 
Mountain — rainforest adventure park — where you can hop on a bobsled and pretend like you’re in “Cool Runnings. ” To reach the attraction, you get to ride an aerial tram through the Jamaican rainforest and glimpse the gorgeous Montego Bay. After walking through an outdoor Usain Bolt tribute museum, for only $20 you can get two tickets to ride — alone or with a partner — down a bobsled course through the rainforest. After you’ve climbed into your own bobsled, you control the speed as you plunge down the twists and turns of the 3,280-foot track. If you’re still riding an adrenaline high, the park also offers a canopy zip-line tour through the jungle. Harnessed to a steel cord, you’ll have the oppor-tunity to literally fly across the top of rainforest. Buying an overpriced souvenir photo, of course, is a must. 
Jamaica’s nightlife is filled with pulsating dancehall 
and reggae clubs in all corners of the island. Unlike LA clubs where you wait in line like cattle ready to be herded inside, Jamaican clubs are an open and welcom-ing to everyone. The sunset-colored walls are packed with locals and vacationers ready to let loose. 
We all know that Jamaica is famous for more than 
just its gorgeous beaches, exotic rainforests and thriv-ing nightlife. It’s also the home of Bob Marley. and a 
population that shares his love for a certain little green 
herb. It’s a must to tour Marley’s home and sample some of the local horticulture.
All in all, check your inhibitions at baggage claim. 
The country is known for partying like there’s no tomorrow, and there’s no reason not to take advantage of that.

GUIDE
spring breakAbeautiful country with a long and pain-ful history, Uganda 
has been ravaged by strife and war for years; corrupt government regimes have left it one of the poorest countries in Africa. Now that colonial and civil wars have subsided, travelers can enjoy a relatively peaceful journey, but visitors are cautioned to avoid some northern regions and villages still affected by the Lord’s Resistance Army. But overall, the people of Uganda are very friendly to foreigners, and travel is remarkably affordable.
Because its market 
revolves around agriculture, Uganda provides for a wide array of landscape photo ops — backdropped by the rug-ged peaks of Mount Kadam, tropical forest canopies, vast plains and the placid Lake Victoria. 
Nothing in Uganda 
overshadows the beauty of its people. A proud, tribal nation, the wide-eyed energy of its residents is worth the visit alone. The depth of life’s challenges and victories can be found in the faces of the people of Uganda: They are poor in wealth but rich in spirit, family and love of life. 
In Uganda, every turn is 
a picture. But photographers should be reminded that it’s both important and courte-ous to ask before taking pho-tos of villagers, since many are uneasy around a camera.

SPRING BREAK
+
SUMMER 2010spring break
In recent years, the overbuilt city of Dubai has 
redefined the idea of opulence. Wealthy beyond belief from its convenient location atop a bubbling 
pot o’ oil, the average family income in Dubai exceeds $180,000 per year.
However, though Dubai was recently noted for 
being one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, overbuilding and debt have left the city in a new state of uncertainty — that’s where you come in.
Shop in the world’s largest mall, trek out on a desert 
safari or stare at the city atop Berj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building. Explore man-made islands in the shape of palm trees, tour an underwater hotel with sharks, go skydiving, snowboard indoors or live in your own skyscraper. Why not? In Dubai, anything is possible. The economy is all “on sale, ” but bring your credit card — Dubai is still as expensive as it is excessive.
Because the city is bustling with construction, bank-
ing and technological prospects, you’ll tend to meet international businessmen more than locals. Dubai 
itself has two sides: the super rich and the super poor. 
As a result, much of the city has been proofed to keep the masses at a distance, and access is difficult. Y ou’ll be surprised by the lack of public beaches and the enor-mous entry fees required to enter most common areas. Plus, due to the extreme climate, Dubai doesn’t really encourage pedestrians to walk the streets — there are very few sidewalks.
Of course, for a photographer, Dubai is an archi-
tectural dreamland. Beautiful buildings are everywhere 
you look. Bottom line: Dubai sets the standard for 
excess, so if you’re looking for the next best thing to Disneyland, this is the place to be.
— ERIK JEPSENphotography editorThink of a magical place. One where you step outside and a mango smoothie is pushed into your hand. Where a whiskey and coke comes $2 by the bucket, and counterfeit designer clothing paves the streets. Y ou, my friend, are entering a tropical slice of 
college-student paradise called Thailand.
Cheap beverages and sweet threads aren’t the only charms of Southeast Asia’s backpacking 
Mecca. Thailand’s got everything you could ask from an exotic tropical climate: luscious green jungles, long glistening beaches and enough ancient monuments to make a historian jizz his cargo pants. Here’s a guide for those who’ d like to spend a month or two meandering these hot and sweaty lands with purpose to explore and propensity to party. 
First, fly into Bangkok. Check into a hotel just off infamous tourist hotspot Khoa San Road. 
(But not on it — it’s expensive. Don’t pay more than about $13 per night for a hostel.) A night out should start at a bar a block or two from the flurry — your dollar will go farther in a place where menus aren’t written in English and bartenders don’t have to be polite. 
Spend about a week in Bangkok, half-drunk and blabbering. Shake out all of your embar-
rassing American tendencies. There’s no place more supportive of your wildest Southeast 
Asian fantasies than the country’s capital — just ask the stars of the city’s infamous ping-pong shows. Y ou’ll get an answer in the form of a vagina-propelled dart.
When it comes to transportation, know what you want before you step into a tuk-tuk car-
riage. While on the prowl for a ride, an eager English-speaking local gave me three tips to help 
Las Vegas
After spending this quarter confined in the suffocatingly sterile walls of Geisel Library, spring break on the vomit-lined streets of Las Vegas is exactly what every repressed UCSD student needs to blow off finals like a rock star. 
Whether cheering on busty strippers at the Kitty Kat Lounge, taunting children pool-
side while six drinks deep, gambling away studen t loan money at the slot machines or 
stumbling into the Flamingo with a head full of acid in an attempt to channel Hunter S. Thompson, there’s no place like Vegas to bring out the freak in all of us.
The grueling five hour drive from San Diego is well worth the brightly lit moment you 
descend upon the Strip. Roll down your windows to let the arid desert heat blast your skin and sit back, mesmerized by the bright neon letters that will have your head spinning long after the ecstasy has left your spinal cord. 
Be prepared to make it rain, even if it is a shallow downpour. Other than gazing in awe 
at the Fountains of Bellagio and pretending you’re from the cast of “Ocean’s Eleven, ” cheap entertainment is hard to come by in a city of big spenders. But spring break isn’t the time to be worrying about such trivial matters — you’ve passed the whole quarter eating Ramen noodles and choking down Popov, so don’t hesitate to throw $40 on the Bellagio Buffet or stuff a couple Lincolns down Cheri’s thong.
Go ahead, indulge. Hot-box your car in Barstow, throw up on the Nike statue and shake 
your ass both on and off the dance floor. Just be careful not to crouch down too low — a bad case of crabs is one souvenir you don’t want to take home.
— YELENA AKOPIANsenior staff writer
Let’s face it: Y our liver can’t tell the difference between spring break and the week following your last midterm. But you can. Which leaves no 
excuse for spending the former Jagerbombing yourself barfless in Costa Verde. “Flights to Puerto Rico” should already be in your search bar.
Out of all the islands eyedropped throughout the 
Caribbean, Puerto Rico stands out not only as the port of call for Captain Morgan, but the land mass that popularized reggaeton’s bass-heavy blend of Jamaican rhythm bloated with salsa and cumbia. In the capital city of San Juan — where most visitors spend their time after sundown — the slender, cobblestoned streets are packed with open-air nightclubs and patio bars, arched doorways and dome awnings. 
The legal drinking age in Puerto Rico is, conve-
spring break DUBAI
It’s the oldest story in the book: Y ou’re a travel-buggin’ college student, with big dreams and an empty wallet. When it comes to convincing your parents that a three-
month trip to Europe could double as a fiscally responsible choice, however, it helps if you can spin it as a summer job — which is where the term “au pair” comes into play.
An au pair is a live-in nanny. And though it’s an effective 
way to get overseas, make no mistake: Even the most patient person in the world will be praying for some alone time after a month of sharing space, no matter how cute the little French toddlers are.
It’s all worth it, though, when you consider the perks.For one thing, you’re living in the foreign country of your 
choice for free. Being American, you’re often asked to teach small children English, which means you can learn as much — or as little — of the language as you like. Either way, you’re getting a complete summer immersion — one that many pay thousands of dollars to have.
The tricky part is finding a family that fits. Speaking a 
foreign language — even just a little — helps immeasurably in your application. Also, saying you love football — that’s soccer, to us heathen Americans — is like an international passport, provided you don’t get too choosy with your teams (a vocal Manchester United supporter may very well get 
passed up by a Chelsea family).
Once you’ve selected and applied to favorite country, 
the easiest way to find a family is through a Web site like 
www.aupairworld.com . Y ou can post your info — in two 
languages, if you want to be fancy — and look up potential families’ profiles according to the number of kids they have, where they live and how long they want you. The only downside is that you will occasionally get e-mails from a “nice single father and business man” who is offer-ing you an exorbitant weekly allowance if you’ll only send 
him a copy of your passport.
The nifty part is that, through such technological advents 
as Facebook, you don’t actually have to fork out the £70 that 
the Web site demands before they hand over a family’s con-tact information. Get a name, then Google it: chances are

La Jolla Shores is an eyeful, but it’s got nothing on the beaches of St. Thomas — a star member of the Virgin Islands, off the eastern edge of Puerto Rico. Think 
shell-strewn white sand that melts into a bath of warm turquoise water, a hammock tied between two gently swaying palm trees and the occasional wandering iguana.
For a clean, quiet sandscape with outstanding snorkeling right 
offshore, hit up Sapphire Beach. Or, nestled in a sheltered cove on the other side of the island, Magens Bay is great for tanning, swim-ming and picnicking. 
Really though — I can’t say it enough: Every inch of the shoreline spring break

ucsdguardian.orgme get around the city: 1) Tell your 
driver exactly where you want to go; 2) tell him how much you’re willing to pay (don’t be afraid to “negotiate”) and 3) tell him you don’t want to go shop-ping. Though you may, in fact, want to peruse a marketplace or two, my third point is imperative to avoiding a long and uncomfortable conversation with a Nepalese tailor. It doesn’t matter how many “sexy beers” he gives you, it’s not worth spending time and money on a custom-fitted pinstriped suit.
When the full moon approaches 
and you’ve had your share of fear and loathing in Khao San, head south to Thailand’s tropical islands. Skip the bar-girl haven of Phuket and make your way toward Koh Phangan. Every full moon, travelers gather to partake in the word’s biggest beach party. Arrive a couple days early, order some whiskey buckets from a stand labeled “Brad Pitt Love Me Long Time” and get out before the onslaught of rav-ers ruins your fun — the difference between 10,000 drunks on the beach and 25,000 drunks is intolerable.
After a string of parties in Koh 
Phangan, either waste time hopping around secluded beaches or make a clean break from the boozy spring-break crowd. I recommend the latter — heading to the North will help you wiggle from the Southern Thailand’s Cancun-like spell, and get to know the country for its people and history.
For your first history lesson, stop 
at Sukhothai, a tiny village in the lower North known for its acres of ancient ruins. Embrace the commu-nity’s relaxed way of life: Rent a bike to tour the national parks in the area. While basking in the peaceful out-doors, keep your eyes out for Bhuddas scattered between lakes and trees.
Depending on how much time 
you’ve got left, you can either con-tinue to another tiny village or head to Chiang Mai, the biggest city in the North and a proverbial middle finger to Bangkok’s smelly sprawl of noise and commerce. Chiang Mai’s known for its giant artisan markets and close proximity to jungles and waterfalls. Perfect your curry-making skills with a cheap cooking class, or go luxuri-ous for a full-body massage from an institution of the blind (their extra-sensitive touch gives them an edge). 
Consider a two-day trip to Pai 
— a little hippie town way up in the healthy green hilltops — for an extra dose of natural scenery. The village has few enough stoplights that you can count them on one hand, sur-rounded by hot springs and warm, flowing waterfalls. Usually, I’ d recom-mend you stay at a hostel, but when visiting Pai, one must irrefutably stay at the Darling Viewpoint Inn. Though slightly infested with bugs, this elevat-ed bungalow hotel has the best view of the city and the friendliest host in town — a cheerful native who goes by the name of, you guessed it, Darling.
Oddly enough, she’ll call you 
Darling, too, and load you in the back of her truck for a trip to the hot spring, where you’ll boil corn and bath in candelight. When you’ve flown the nest, you can spend your free time drinking mushroom shakes (yes, the special kind) and listening to lady men sing in the Pai cafes.
After that, it’s up to you. Either 
wander from village to village in search of something cool, head back to Bangkok or take a rickety old boat into Laos. But don’t leave without at least one night of too much rice whis-key and grasshoppers — you’ll never find a drunk, nor insect, so delectable.
— ALYSSA BEREZNAKmanaging editoris tropical perfection, ripe for sailing, surfing, kayaking, windsurfing, snor-keling, scuba diving, fishing or just relaxing on the shore, taking swigs of the spectacular view.
And what would the Caribbean be 
without rum? Whether served com-plimentary as you step off the plane or in a mixed drink as you lounge pool-side, don’t miss the warm ‘n’ fuzziest side of Caribbean culture, free to be enjoyed by everyone 18 and over. Cruzan Rum, distilled on the island, is known to be one of the best brands in the world, and comes in flavors rang-ing from coconut to raspberry.
After a full day at the beach, 
a popular St. Thomas hangout is Duffy’s Love Shack, located right across the street from the St. John Ferry Dock. If you’re with a group, order the Shark Tank: A 64 oz. fish-bowl filled with rum and liquers. For a taste of traditional Caribbean cuisine — like fried plantains, jerk chicken or an oatmeal dish called fungi — dine out at Fungi’s on the Beach. On Saturday night, be sure to visit Iggie’s for all-you-can-eat crab legs and (post-rum) karaoke.
The city of Charlotte Amalie must be visited at least once. For a true taste of Caribbean flair, stop at the open-air bazaar on the corner of the city and barter for everything from shells to printed sarongs to haircuts. The Pirate Museum on top of the hill pays tribute to the Caribbean’s swashbuckling past, while offering spectacular views of the cruise-ship harbor and the city. 
A few remnants of Danish colo-
nization in the 1600s linger on the island, including huge stone sugar mills hidden in lush undergrowth and the historic main city’s cobble-stone streets, on which you must stick to the left side of the road.
St. Thomas is only a 30-minute 
flight from Florida, and since it’s technically part of the United States, no passport is needed.

niently, 18 and over. Taxis are the easiest way to navigate the city, especially for anyone looking to spend most of their time in Puerto Rico’s urban clusters. Sticking to San Sebastian and Calle Fortaleza is a surefire way to make sure you find the best hotspots — both of which are located in the northern part of the capital known as Old San Juan. 
Restaurants in Old San Juan 
are popular digs for tourists: Latin “fusion” cuisine, late-night tapas bars and mini Margaritavilles fea-turing live bands. Fratelli’s is an easy find, on the southern end of Calle Fortaleza, and an even easier place to relax in. Serving Italian cuisine blended with Mediterranean and Puerto Rican ingredients, it also doubles as a bar once night sets in. Prices for entrees throughout Old San Juan range from $10 to $40, depending on whether you’re among the sandaled crowds or reservation-only richies.
Though beautiful beaches are old 
news for most of us, Puerto Rico’s warmer waters are a whole new kind of paradise. With more than 275 miles of coastline, it’s not hard to find a good patch of sand on which to plop. If you’re sticking to San Juan, then Isla Verde is a posh stretch tex-tured with lean palms and towering hotels. But if you’ d rather break the tourist veneer, drive down the cost to find a secluded spot tapering off a rainforest or surf–eaten cliff.

The AmazonIn the Amazon, dipping your hand in the river is an act of faith that it won’t get chewed off — and snakes aren’t just 
extremely poisonous, but can be up to 14 feet long. If you’re up for a walk on the wild side, there’s no better place to be.
Choose from a weekend getaway camp at 
Lake Sandoval snf the four-hours-from-civili-zation, only-three-hours-worth-of-antivenom lodges deeper along the Madre de Dios River.
Lodges like Sandoval straddle the line 
between adventure and getaway, rooming dozens of tourists with a bar and TVs — but you didn’t fly all the way to Peru so you could sit around and play Bullshit with other Americans: Plunk your ass in a motorboat and speed downriver. Remember that you’re going to be crammed into a blind with these three or four people waiting for macaws to gather, so make friends early.
The first walk into the Amazon will be a 
shock: Under the thin tree canopy, the Amazon looks like the kind of trail you’ d jog back in the US, more brown than green, not like the verdant wonderland you’ d find in Costa Rica.
Let your inner eight-year-old loose for the 
bugs, like metallic blue morpho butterflies and bullet ants (not as poisonous as the snakes, but after 24 hours of pain, you might wish they were). Anything larger than that tends to hide itself pretty well — don’t be amazed if the only mammals you see are walking-meal capybaras, lapping at the water in the twilight as the eyes of caiman crocs glow the same red as an alarm clock — but every tour makes a point of viewing the macaw parrots, all of them as brightly colored as skittles. Make sure your camera has a good zoom for the macaws, because you won’t get much closer than a football field.
Once you’ve gotten over the fact that every-
thing in the Amazon seems to be horribly dangerous and aggressive, give yourself a real gift: Walk the first few minutes into the rainfor-est without a guide. Idiotic? Hell yes, but when you’re in the Amazon and you own that moment yourself, not sharing it with anyone else — well, that’s simply priceless.

COSTA RICAbus out. I’ d highly recommend 
the detour; although you can still snag some amazing pictures of Mt. McKinley from the road, it’s not the same as heading off on your own.
Just make sure to have a back-up 
plan in the likely event that you come across some bears or caribou. Denali is all open wilderness — our country’s least-developed national park, posi-tively brimming with unique flora and fauna. Alaska’s summertime sun-light starts early in the morning and lasts for 19 hours, so there’ll be plenty of time to get back out of the park, drop your stuff off at your hostel and head over to the nearest bar to com-pare adventures. Y ou’ll be nothing less than a first-class badass for brav-ing the great beyond.
— AYELET BITTONsenior staff writeryou’ll have an e-mail within seconds.
When it comes down to it, being 
an au pair is beyond awesome. As long as you take your time to choose the right family, you’ll end up with one that’s perfect for you. (Skype interviews are invaluable, even if they’re a little awkward, and mostly involve waving at cute four-year-olds that don’t quite understand who the face on the computer is.) Once you’re there, just say ‘Y es’ to everything, and you’re practically guaranteed a good time. If a French passerby offers you “muscadet” or a Londoner proposes a trip to a gay bar, go for it (just don’t try the margaritas — that seems to be an Americas-only concept).
Once you’ve arrived, your first 
challenge is to earn the adoration of your kids. Disney is a universal pass-port to said adoration. Use it early; use it often. Admit you know the whole plot of “ Aladdin” to memory, and the kids will accept you wholeheartedly into every princess/prince-themed game under the sun. 
Days off are the greatest thing 
that can happen, mostly because they give you a chance to explore the world you’ve thrown yourself into. Get your family’s advice on some must-see attractions and then set off for the unknown, armed with a map and some rudimentary subject-verb knowledge. Have conversations with random locals, sit at a cafe, ask people for directions to museums you’ve apparently walked past 20 times already — you have the whole sum-mer to figure out the basics, and you shouldn’t pass up a croissant-munch-ing football-watching moment of it.

If you’re searching for an all-inclusive break that won’t involve 
much thought or travel time, look no further than the port of San Diego. Taking a three- to five-day Carnival Cruise to Mexico will 
make all dreams of cheap boozing, random hookups and constant grubbing come true.
There’s no time like the present to take advantage of an economy 
that’s gone to shit. After you sell last quarter’s textbooks, you can hop on a Carnival Cruise ship for as little as $199.
Unlike most ocean liners, Carnival Cruises weren’t designed for 
those teetering between retirement and death. With a focus on clients 35 and under, Carnival is the only cruise line that allows 18-year-olds to drink onboard (in international waters, of course).
But if you don’t want to fork out $9 for on-board cocktails, Mexico 
is a good place to buy brand-name alcohol for half of what you’ d pay stateside. As high-school as it sounds, bring extra water bottles to fill with your international purchase — while the cruise line doesn’t mind you paying through the nose for their drinks, they’re not too keen on co-eds getting wasted off the $12 Absolut they bought at a Mexican drugstore.
Drugs, sex and rock ‘n’ roll aside, the best part of the trip is an 
utter lack of responsibility or purpose. There’s nothing better than waking up in the morning and leaving the mess you can’t quite recall making to the ship’s cleaning staff while you devour a four-course breakfast.
Technically, you’re supposed to be at least 21 to cruise alone; 
however, if you can find someone who is 21 to register with you, you won’t have a problem getting aboard.
So leave the worry of finding a designated driver on the boarding 
platform — you definitely don’t want to miss the boat on this one.

Costa Rica is renowned for its lazy pace, winding beach-es and dependable surf. Compared to neighboring Central American destinations it’s known for its stabil-
ity and tourist-friendly attitude. But with roads that have more potholes than tarmac, Costa Rica gives you the best of both worlds: a pristine resort off the beaten path.
Most flights will land you smack-dab in the middle of 
the congested capital of San Jose, where taxis tear through the streets and locals push grocery carts full of fresh oranges, waiting and ready to be squeezed straight into your cup. Most visitors high-tail it out of San Jose as soon as the plane comes to a stop, but if you give it a chance, the city comes through. Get your souvenir shopping out of the way in its curio shops, stacked with beach-themed trinkets. Or, if your goal is to get your bronze on, gear up for the chaotic central bus station, and ride a couple hours to either the Pacific or Caribbean coasts. 
The first stop along the Pacific is Jaco, a dirty beach town typically utilized as a weekend getaway from San 
Jose. If you’re willing to put in a little more bus time, however, the beaches get exponentially better. To the north lies Nicoya Peninsula and the surf town of Tamarindo, or the more upscale Moctezuma, which offers day trips to the Cabo Blanco Nature Reserve. If you’re the wildlife type, head south to Manuel Antonio. Mind your bag: monkeys have been known to unzip backpacks and snag unsuspecting snacks. 
The rasta vibe seeps into everything on the Caribbean coast, from coconut drinks to green-, yellow- and red-
painted mini-marts. Head over to Lima for an umbrella drink in a hammock and a chance to watch the sun rise over the calm, rolling waves. Y ou can also bus up to Tortuguero National Park on the northern Caribbean coast, where a guided night stroll along the beach to find the famous Leatherback turtle will bring you nose to nose with a beautiful three- to six-foot giant.

CREW — It seemed like nothing could stop 
the UCSD men’s crew team from continu-
ing its domination of the San Diego City Championships on Feb. 27 — until Mother Nature had her say. 
Early Saturday morning, a magnitude-8.8 
earthquake hit the coast of Chile, sending shock waves up the coast of North and South America, and tsunami warnings as far north as Alaska and as far west as Japan and Russia. Due to the high chance of strong waves streaking across the coast, the men’s and women’s crew San Diego city championships — which were scheduled to take place in Mission Bay — will be rescheduled later this week.
The UCSD men’s team has won the inaugu-
ral race of the season for the past five consecu-tive years, and — even with a young cast — was banking on winning it this year too.
“For the past three of five years, this event 
has been canceled or rescheduled for some reason, ” men’s head coach Zach Johnson said. “This wasn’t a big deal for some of the seniors on our team who have already seen a few city championships canceled. ”
The league race was also to be the first of 
the season for the women, who were hoping to let their young team rack up some experience at the event.
Both the men’s and women’s teams are filled with young, inexperienced racers anxious to get the season started, but they may now have to squeeze two events into one week — depending on when the race will be made up.
“We’re not sure when this race is going to 
get rescheduled to, ” Johnson said. “We have all of our weekends booked through the end of the season, so unless we want to schedule it midweek, we’ll have to schedule it for the end of the year. ”
Typically, the season’s opening race does not 
happen until April, but because the Tritons will partake in the George Washington Invitational in early April, the coaches in San Diego sched-uled the annual city championships for this weekend. 
“We usually start the season later, but we 
had a great opportunity to go to a big meet, ” Johnson said. “So the coaches in this area scheduled the meet now — but now, we’ll have to work something else, because we will see them next weekend at the UC San Diego Regatta race. ”
In light of the cancellation, Johnson said the 
team was able to hold invaluable practice on rowing machines — something they had been unable to do yet this season.
Despite the delay, the Tritons will get back 
in the water next weekend at the UCSD Regatta race in Mission Bay.

said she is looking for the same consistency in 
postseason play.
“Our four seniors have given so much to this 
program, ” Elliott said. “Noonan and Ilg have given the last four years to this team, and I can’t say enough about their commitment, work ethic and impact on this team. Leilani Martin and Kristen Cabral have made an incredible impact and contribution to this program in their two short years. They have bought into our system and have given their hearts and souls to make this team better. ”All four seniors played in every game this 
season, contributing an average of nearly 24 points per game.
“ All four of them will be tremendously 
missed, ” Elliott said. “It will be a sad day when we have to say good bye to them ... so we are going to try to put that off for as long as possible. ”
The Tritons will begin tournament play by 
hosting Cal State Dominguez Hills on March 2 at RIMAC arena, hitting the floor at 7 p.m.

#WdZckY^ceh[UCSD SCORES ROAD UPSET AT UCLA 
By Jessy Jahangir
Staff Writer
MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — The No. 14 
UCSD men’s volleyball team rolled into UCLA ’s Pauley Pavilion on Feb. 24 facing a heavily favored Bruin team.
But despite the odds, the Tritons 
upset No. 3 UCLA 30-22, 30-25, 30-26, in a three-set stretch on Feb. 24. This was the third Triton victory over the Bruins in the past three years — and in 38 all-time meetings. With the win, UCSD improved 5-11 overall, and 2-9 in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, while UCLA dropped 9-7 overall and 8-5 in the MPSF. Prior to the match, the Bruins had won eight of their last 10 matches. 
As soon as they hit the court, the 
Tritons took the lead and held on until the end of the first set. UCSD hit at .567 with 22 kills, compared to the Bruins’ 11 kills, and won the set 30-22.
In the second set, there were 12 ties 
and seven lead changes. The Bruins took their final lead in the set at 15-14. UCSD fought back with junior outside hitter Joel Davidson’s kill and took the lead on a UCLA setting error. With the score at 25-23, a UCLA service error and a kill from senior out-side hitter Frank Fritsch brought up UCSD’s lead by two points. A Bruin side out, another kill from Fritsch and an ace by senior setter Erik Sierks helped the Tritons take the set 30-25.The third set was closely fought 
with 23 ties and six lead changes. UCSD outhit UCLA .405 to .184; however, the Bruins still managed to make it a difficult set. They were narrowly edging past the Tritons by one point until UCSD delivered three consecutive kills via redshirt freshman middle blocker Cyrus Kiani, senior setter Phil Bannan and Davidson, clinching a 27-25 lead. Despite a service error that narrowed the Triton lead to 27-26, a final push from UCSD — including a kill from Fritsch and a block by Kiani — gave them a match point. A UCLA attack error gifted UCSD the final point to finish the set 30-26.
UCSD hit at a .427 overall attack 
average. Fritsch led the Tritons with 16 kills and a .419 hitting average. Davidson contributed 12 kills. Senior outside hitter Jason Spangler also con-tributed two service aces, increasing his career total to 78 — just two aces short of tying the all-time record of career-aces at UCSD.
“We got off to a great start. We 
played steady, and knew UCLA  would 
come back, ” head coach Kevin Ring said. “For us, it was a really a com-plete game. We did everything well. ”
On Friday 
night, the Tritons trav-eled to Irvine to square off against No. 11 UC Irvine. Unfortunately, UCSD took too long to find its pace in the match and lost in four sets to Irvine 30-15, 
30-25, 29-31 and 30-23. The loss dropped the Tritons to 5-12 overall, and 2-10 in MPSF, while the Anteaters improved to 9-9 overall, and 5-8 in MPSF.
UCSD only had nine kills against 
11 attack errors in the first set. The second set was unfortunately not much better, with the Tritons hitting at .077.
The Tritons improved in the third 
set, hitting percentage of .417 and a tally of 24 kills — more than the first two sets combined. Nonetheless,  the Anteaters took a quick 15-9 lead. UCSD fought hard to make amends and narrowed UC Irvine’s lead to 26-23. Junior Adrian Guthals’ kill and block, as well as a block by Bannan, tied the set at 26-26. After exchang-ing a series of points, Davidson sent consecutive kills to give the Tritons a 31-29 set victory.
The Anteaters took a quick 4-1 
lead in the fourth set. The Tritons managed to come back at 13-12 until the Anteaters rallied, scoring seven of the next nine points to take its lead to 20-14. Unfortunately, this disparity was too much for the Tritons to close, and the closest UCSD got to victory was 24-21. Ultimately, the Anteaters took the set 30-23.
In the first two sets, the Tritons 
were hitting below .100. Davidson contributed a team-high 19 kills, Spangler had 14 kills, Guthals con-tributed seven kills and Fritsch added six kills. Bannan contributed 47 assists and 15 digs.
The Tritons return to action on

MEN’S BASKETBALL — The UCSD 
men’s basketball team finished its sea-son on Feb. 26 at its senior night game against Humboldt State University — the final collegiate game for senior players Jordan Lawley and Tyler Acevedo. 
But despite the occasion, the 
Tritons were unable to translate emotion into execution, and lost 87-79 to the Lumberjacks just two days after a 70-57 loss to Sonoma State.
The team had high 
hopes of sending its senior players, who were playing their last game in Triton colors, off with a win. Senior guard Tyler Acevedo and sophomore center Christian Hatch scored a combined 34 points, supported by junior guard Casey Ryan’s eight points off the bench. Senior guard and team scoring average leader Jordan Lawley finished with 14 points.
The Tritons were within four 
points of a tie with less than three minutes left, but Humboldt State forward Kevin Atkins led the Lumberjacks to a regular season-ending win by scoring a game-high 31 points and pulling down nine rebounds.
On Wednesday, Sonoma State 
took a commanding lead at the end of the first half and held onto it for the rest of the game. 
Despite a strong performance 
from sophomore guard Bryce Alvari, who went 6-6 from the free-throw line with six points, and Hatch, who went 4-9 from the field with eight points, the Tritons could not keep up with the Seawolves.
Head coach Chris Carlson says 
he is looking to rebuild his team to improve upon the progress made by this years team.
But for Lawley and Acevedo, there 
won’t be a next season. 
“I tried to hold onto every 
moment, ” Lawley said. “I feel blessed that I was able to play four years on the basketball team, and I don’t take it for granted. I was glad to be able to be a part of the team. ”
Acevedo said that 
emotions ran high in the locker room after Friday’s game. 
“Student athletes 
create bonds that will be lifelong, ” Acevedo said.
Though Lawley and 
Acevedo must now move on to lives beyond basketball, both players said that being a part of UCSD Athletics has 
changed their lives in positive ways.
Acevedo said being a student 
athlete instilled in him a management ethic that transcends just the sport.
“[Athletics] gave me more 
responsibility and time management skills to help me get by with my schoolwork, ” Acevedo said.
The Triton basketball team will 
now enter the off-season looking to improve on their 2009-10 season. They finished with an 8-17 overall record and 7-15 in the California Collegiate Athletic Association.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL —  The UCSD seniors finished 
their final season in style at their game against Humboldt State on Feb. 26, finally avenging the early season loss that had cut short their perfect 14-0 season start.
The Tritons turned in a crushing 86-51 victory over 
Humboldt State. Sophomore guard Chelsea Carlisle made 29 points and seven assists, while junior forward Tiffany Hunter added 13 points and seven rebounds.
The victory marked the last regular-
season game for the Triton seniors — forward Erin Noonan, forward Kristen Cabral, guard Leilani Martin and guard Annette Ilg — who were honored before the game.  
“It meant so much to beat 
Humboldt, because we got a second chance to show them what we’re made of, ” Noonan said.
Thanks to the win, the Tritons 
clinched sole possession of their second consecutive California Collegiate Athletic Association championship, having taken once step closer to the title with a win over Sonoma State on Feb. 24.
“It was a fantastic night last night 
for UCSD women’s basketball, ” head coach Charity Elliott said. “Not only did we avenge the loss earlier in the year to Humboldt, but we sent off our seniors in remarkable fashion. ”
The Tritons started the game slowly, struggling with 
Humboldt’s full court pressure, falling behind 10-15 at the midpoint of the first half.
However, Carlisle woke up the Triton offense by scoring 
nine straight points in a 19-4 run. UCSD went on to outscore Humboldt 32-15 for the rest of the half, carrying a commanding 18-point lead into the break. 
The Tritons opened the second half 
with a 21-9 run and went on to rout the Lumberjacks, extending their lead to as much as 37 points. 
The loss dropped Humboldt to 16-
10 overall and 14-8 in the CCAA. The Lumberjacks earned the fourth seed in the CCAA postseason tournament, and will play against Cal State Monterey Bay in the first round.
The Tritons walked onto the court 
Saturday night having already won a 
share of the title 68-52 against Sonoma 
State on Feb. 24. Carlisle once again led the way with 11 points and 8 assists, while 11 of the players racked up points for UCSD.
The Tritons never trailed, en route 
to a comfortable victory. The loss dropped Sonoma to 8-13 in league play and denied the Seawolves a chance to play in the postseason.
UCSD wrapped up the regular season with a 24-3  
overall record, including 19-3 in conference play. With their conference title, the Tritons earned the top seed in the CCAA tournament, and will face No. 8 Cal State Dominguez Hills on Tuesday.
Noonan said the Tritons are wary of an upset, after 
falling in the first round of last year’s tournament with a tough loss to Cal State San Bernardino. 
“I think these tournament games are more significant to 
the seniors because these are games we don’t get back, and there is no next time, ” Noonan said. “We don’t get another year. It’s now or never for us, and we’re looking to make it happen. ”
Of the four seniors, Noonan and Ilg have been regular 
starters for the Tritons, while Martin and Cabral have been frequent contributors from the bench. Coach Elliott 
had nothing but glowing praise for her team leaders, and
